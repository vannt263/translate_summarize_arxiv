    "since the introduction of the gunn - peterson ( gp ) test by @xcite , a detailed knowledge about the physical state of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) has been gained from the study of the absorption features identified in the spectra of quasi - stellar objects ( qsos ) at restframe wavelengths @xmath4 , which are now known to be mainly due to resonant scattering by intergalactic neutral hydrogen randomly distributed along the line - of - sight , as first proposed by @xcite .",
    "for instance , the null result in the search for a gp trough has been used to rule out the existence of a hot intercloud medium ( icm ) @xcite , which was thought to confine by pressure the ly@xmath2 clouds @xcite . as a result of detailed analyses of the line statistics of the absorbing material , a wealth of information on its clustering ( see _ e.g. _ * ? ? ? * ) , in particular the existence of voids ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , and the evolution of its number densities , column densities , and doppler parameter with redshift ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has accumulated over the past years .",
    "these results , in combination with the use of state - of - the - art numerical simulations of structure formation based on the currently accepted paradigm of the concordance cosmology @xcite , show that the features seen in absorption against bright background sources arise when the line - of - sight intersects the structures that naturally emerge and evolve with time under the influence of gravitational attraction .",
    "different types of structures such as the filaments present in the _ cosmic web _ , galactic haloes , and even the discs of primeval galaxies , give rise to distinct absorption features attributed to entities known historically as ly@xmath2 forest clouds , lyman limit systems ( llss ) , and damped ly@xmath2 absorbers ( dlas ) ( see _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for excellent reviews , respectively ) .",
    "nevertheless , the relation between the observed absorption features and the objects causing them , in particular the correlation between observed damped absorption lines , metal lines ( _ e.g. _ mg ii , o vi ) and galaxies  the so - called absorber - galaxy connection  is still a matter of debate ( see _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* part 1 ) . as a consequence of numerous efforts over many years",
    ", we now have a better understanding of the origins of the different absorption features observed in qso spectra .",
    "in particular , the notion of discrete , intervening hi absorbing systems randomly distributed along the line - of - sight has been embedded into the more general picture of an evolving _ continuous _ intergalactic medium with a hi density field that varies in space and time , with its evolution driven mainly by the hubble expansion , the radiation field of ionising uv sources , and the collapse of structures due to gravity .      over decades",
    "many people have been working hard towards inferring the physical properties of the intergalactic medium such as its chemical content , density , temperature , etc .",
    "( see _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ) by measuring the type of transition , strength , number density , and profiles of absorption lines imprinted in the spectra of qsos and , more recently , of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    ". there has also been a great effort to quantify the effect of the absorption due to intergalactic neutral hydrogen on the photometric properties of background sources . as a matter of fact",
    ", several models have been developed in order to account for this so - called intergalactic attenuation , with different approaches and purposes .",
    "@xcite used monte carlo simulations to estimate the amount of absorption at wavelengths shorter than the redshifted heii @xmath5 line , in order to test the feasibility of the equivalent of the gunn - peterson test for intergalactic helium .",
    "they found that the absorption as a function of wavelength , averaged over many lines - of - sight , should display together with a characteristic stair - case profile due to the cumulative absorption at the hi resonant wavelengths , an additional characteristic valley - shaped feature ( the  lyman - valley  ) due to the cumulative effect of the photoionisation of hi by photons with energies @xmath6 , where @xmath7 .",
    "later on , in a seminal paper @xcite developed an analytical method to quantify the opacity due to intergalactic hi as a function of redshift , and its effect on the colors of high - redshift galaxies .",
    "the underlying assumption of this model is that the observed flux of a source at redshift @xmath8 is given by the product of the _ intrinsic _ flux and a transmission factor that accounts for the _ mean _ absorption as a function of wavelength given in the form @xmath9 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* their equation 3 ) , where the brackets denote the average over an ensemble of random lines - of - sight .",
    "the most common application of this model consists in correcting the flux of a synthetic ( galaxy- , qso- ) spectrum for intergalactic absorption .",
    "this correction is of particular importance at high redshift , where intergalactic hi severely absorbs the light of a background object at restframe wavelengths shorter than @xmath10 , leading to a substantial reddening of its colour ( see _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "as the numerous references in the literature attest , the @xcite model has become the most widely used attenuation model .",
    "however , in a later work ( * ? ? ?",
    "* from now on bcg99 ) argued that it is not possible to estimate the mean change in the magnitude of a source at a given redshift due to absorption by intergalactic hi along the line - of - sight by multiplying the mean transmission curve of @xcite s model with the spectrum of the source and integrating over the corresponding passband , mainly because of the existence of color terms .",
    "they suggested that the correct way of accounting for the mean effect of hi absorption on the spectrum of a background source and on its photometric properties is to model first the absorption along many random lines - of - sight , compute the desired photometric quantities for each one of them , and _ then _ compute the average over the ensemble of lines - of - sight .",
    "in other words , they argue that the processes of averaging over many random lines - of - sight and measuring photometric quantities are non - commutative .",
    "indeed , they showed using a monte carlo technique that the average magnitudes computed following their approach substantially differ from those computed using @xcite s model , even when using the same input distributions for the number of absorbers , their column densities and doppler parameters .",
    "the approach proposed by effectively mimics the measurement process that would take place if one would determine _ e.g. _ the mean observed brightness of a collection of galaxies with different absorber populations along their particular lines - of - sight , but otherwise identical in their intrinsic properties ( spectrum , morphology , etc . ) , and is hence physically meaningful .",
    "it turns out that features such as the characteristic stair - case profile and the lyman - valley can not possibly be observed in a _",
    "spectrum , since they arise only by averaging over sufficient numbers of lines - of - sight , a process that has no physical meaning . in a more recent paper ,",
    "@xcite developed a method to compute the opacity due to intergalactic hi by using hydrodynamical simulations of structure formation in the framework of the concordance @xmath11cdm cosmology performed by @xcite .",
    "applying their model to compute broad - band magnitudes for different types of objects ( _ e.g. _ starburst galaxies , qsos of type i and ii ) , @xcite reports differences of 0.5  1.0 mag with respect to @xcite s model .",
    "despite the different results obtained , this model is similar to @xcite s model in the sense that it implicitly assumes that the mean opacity of the igm along a random line - of - sight due to the presence of hi can be accounted for by multiplying a given input spectrum with a mean attenuation curve of the form @xmath12 and integrating over the corresponding filter function ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* their equation 8) .",
    "following , we state that @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the intrinsic flux , @xmath15 is the filter transmission function , and the brackets denote the average over all lines - of - sight .",
    "we consider that the operation implied by the right - hand side of this expression is the correct way of estimating mean magnitudes of background objects including the effect of the absorption due to intergalactic hi .",
    "this approach is of course not restricted to the computation of mean magnitudes and colors , and can be applied to the estimate of the mean of any photometric quantity .",
    "furthermore , it is also possible to determine not only the mean , but in principle any desired confidence interval around the mean , _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath16 range , via the computation of quantiles ( see section [ sec : res ] ) .",
    "it should be clear that not only the method , but also the input physics is an ( even more ) crucial ingredient of a particular model that accounts for the intergalactic attenuation , as already shown by .",
    "it is , however , not trivial to test whether using a particular method and a set of input distributions accurately describes the observed effect of the absorption by intergalactic hi on the spectra of background sources .",
    "for example , the evolutionary synthesis models of @xcite that include the correction for intergalactic absorption based on @xcite s model match quite well the observations of galaxies in the hubble deep field ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their figure 12 ) , since the magnitude differences reported by ( their figure 7 ) for one of their models with respect to @xcite s model are in this case of the order of the scatter of the observations around the predicted colors .",
    "in other words , even though @xcite s and s approaches are fundamentally different , it is difficult to test the accuracy of their predictions on the basis of a comparison to _ e.g. _ observed galaxy colors . a quantity that is more sensitive to the absorption due to intergalactic hi is the mean cosmic flux decrement @xmath0 ( cf .",
    "section [ sec : cfd ] ) .",
    "the reason for this is that the restframe wavelength range over which this quantity is measured is typically @xmath17 wide , and is hence narrower than typical broadband filters .",
    "we thus consider as a primer test that any model that accounts for the absorption due to intergalactic hi should reproduce first of all the observations of this quantity .",
    "hence , through the comparison of their respective predictions to measurements of @xmath0 it should be possible to discriminate between different models which may or may not be appropriate to account for the effect of the intergalactic attenuation on the spectra of background sources .",
    "we select for this comparison two of several models introduced by to compute the magnitude changes of high - redshift galaxies due to intergalactic absorption , and which are based , respectively , on the input distribution functions of @xcite , and the input physics of the @xcite approach .",
    "the latter is chosen since , as already mentioned , it is the model most widely used in the literature ; the former constitutes , to the best of our knowledge , the most complete set of input distribution functions for the evolution of the ly@xmath2 absorbers to date , later expanded but not significantly changed by @xcite .",
    "+ to sum up : the main goal of this work is to model and analyse the redshift evolution of @xmath0 for different evolution scenarios of the intergalactic neutral hydrogen , conveniently parametrized by input distribution functions of the form of equation ( [ eq : ddf ] , section [ sec : cfd ] ) .",
    "hence , the models we consider here differ only by the set of input distribution functions used , but they all equal in method , _",
    "i.e. _ all of them take advantage of the monte carlo technique .",
    "we judge the goodness of a particular model by its power to reproduce the observations of @xmath0 in a wide redshift range , and analyse to which extent the theoretical expectations about the properties of @xmath0 are recovered from the measurements .",
    "this work is organised as follows : in section [ sec : cfd ] we briefly recall the concept of the cosmic flux decrement and discuss some issues related to its measurement .",
    "in section [ sec : mod ] we present two different types of models for the intergalactic attenuation , which we use to model the redshift evolution of the cosmic flux decrement . in section [ sec : mda ] , we describe our measurements of this quantity for a sample of sdss qso spectra . finally , we compare these and previous measurements to the outcomes of each model , and discuss the results of this comparison as well as some other implications of the models for the evolution of @xmath0 in section [ sec : res ] .",
    "before high - resolution ( _ i.e. _ @xmath18 ) , high s / n observation became feasible , the basic spectroscopic technique used to analyse the effect of the absorption due to intergalactic neutral hydrogen on the spectra of background sources was to measure the mean depression of the observed flux relative to the unabsorbed flux or emission continuum , a quantity which became to be known as cosmic flux decrement .",
    "this quantity , first introduced by @xcite , can be defined as a function of redshift by    @xmath19    where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the continuum and the observed fluxes , respectively , and .",
    "formally , the integral is computed in the restframe wavelength range , _",
    "i.e. _ between the ly@xmath22 and the ly@xmath2 emission lines .",
    "however , the actual estimate of @xmath0 is usually performed between the restframe wavelengths and or in an even narrower wavelength interval in order to avoid contamination by the emission wings of the ly@xmath22 + ovi and ly@xmath2 lines , respectively . since @xmath0 is extremely sensitive to @xmath20 , as can be easily seen from the definition ( [ eq : cfd ] ) , an accurate measurement of this quantity demands a reliable estimate of the underlying continuum .",
    "unfortunately , there is no consensus of what the best method to estimate the continuum may be . a popular choice , mainly because of the presence of emission lines redward of the ly@xmath2 forest region , consists in fitting a local continuum , most commonly using cubic splines ( see _ e.g. _ * ?",
    "* ) or b - spline functions ( see _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , searching for regions apparently free of absorption blueward of the ly@xmath2 emission line .",
    "other authors prefer to fit a continuum in the region redward of the red wing of the ly@xmath2 emission line , and extrapolate it to the region blueward of it @xcite .",
    "a widely adopted form for the fitted continuum in this case is a power - law with spectral index @xmath23 which for wavelengths @xmath24 takes on values in the range ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the latter method may tend to place the intrinsic continuum level higher than it actually is , thus overestimating the measured values of @xmath0 ( cf .",
    "[ sub : con ] ; see also * ? ? ? * and references therein ) ; for the former method the opposite is true , in general ( see _ e.g. _ * ? ? ? * ) . for either method ,",
    "there is an uncertainty in the estimate of the continuum , and this is the main drawback of the mean flux depression as a technique to estimate the mean absorption due to neutral hydrogen present in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) . in an attempt to overcome this problem",
    ", @xcite used the idea that the cosmic flux decrement effectively measures the _ total _ equivalent width of all ly@xmath2 absorption lines in the chosen wavelength range if corrected for the contribution of metal absorption lines to measure this quantity by simply adding up the equivalent widths of lines identified as ly@xmath2 absorption lines .",
    "of course , the reliability of this technique highly depends on the correct identification of lines , and misidentification may lead to larger uncertainties than those associated to the continuum estimate .",
    "it turns out that reliable measurements of @xmath0 are very useful to constrain estimates of fundamental cosmological parameters such as the mean baryon density @xmath25 , the uv background intensity @xcite , the normalization of the power spectrum @xmath26 , the vacuum - energy density @xmath27 , and the hubble parameter @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "it is hence of great interest to contrast observations to theoretical models of the evolution of @xmath0 , in which the bias due to the uncertainty in the estimate of the continuum is absent .",
    "this has been previously done by different workers ( see _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , usually obtaining a good agreement with observations .",
    "however , there is still a scatter in the observations of this quantity for which it has not been accounted yet in any modelling so far .",
    "it is possible that this scatter may well be due to the difference in the methods used by each group to measure @xmath0 and to the different redshift ranges probed .",
    "hence , by taking advantage of the monte carlo technique , we assess to which extent the _ observed _ scatter can be ascribed to the _ intrinsic _ scatter in @xmath0 due to fluctuations in the properties ( number density , column density , doppler parameter ) of the hi absorbers along different lines - of - sight ( see section [ sec : sca ] ) . from the theoretical point of view , assuming that the restframe equivalent width of the absorbers does not evolve with redshift , and that the number density of the absorbing systems evolves like @xmath29 , it is expected that @xmath0 should evolve with @xmath8 like @xmath30 where the extra factor @xmath31 comes from the scaling of the equivalent width , as pointed out by @xcite .",
    "indeed , it has been found empirically that the redshift evolution of @xmath0 can be described by a power law with @xmath32 and @xmath33 @xcite , even though other functional forms , _ e.g. _ an exponential of the form with @xmath34 and @xmath35 @xcite also match well the observations .",
    "more recently , @xcite showed that the observed evolution of @xmath0 with redshift in the range @xmath36 is well described by a broken power - law , even though the significance of the fit is low . in any case , expressions like these are only valid up to a given redshift , since they diverge for @xmath37 , whilst @xmath0 converges asymptotically to 1 in this limit or , more precisely , when z approaches the redshift @xmath38 at which reionisation sets on .",
    "as will be shown later , the redshift evolution of @xmath0 predicted by our simulations does satisfy this asymptotic behaviour ( cf .",
    "section [ sec : res ] ) .",
    "furthermore , even if the power - law form for the evolution of @xmath0 holds , the index @xmath39 in equation ( [ eq : pwl ] ) should be replaced by @xmath40 , where the latter index accounts for the averaged evolution of absorbers of different column densities , which evolve all at different rates .",
    "conversely , estimates of a single @xmath39 from @xmath0 measurements assuming a power - law of the form of equation ( [ eq : pwl ] ) , as done by @xcite , may give a hint on the population of absorbers _ dominating _ the behaviour of @xmath0 , comparing the estimated @xmath39 with the power - law index of the different populations .",
    "for instance , according to one of the models considered here , the redshift evolution of @xmath0 will be shown to be dominated by absorbers with column densities @xmath41 . + a compilation of @xmath0 measurements , accumulated in the literature over the past twenty years approximately , and which includes our own measurements that extend the redshift range to @xmath42 , is shown in figure [ fig : daz ] ( cf .",
    "section [ sec : mda ] and cited references for details on the measurements in this figure ) .",
    "since the observation of individual sources ( galaxies , qsos , grbs ) necessarily implies observations along different lines - of - sight , it is expected that the stochastic nature of the distribution of the ly@xmath2 absorbers , especially of those with the highest column densities , causes a scatter in the observed absorption , even for sources with identical intrinsic spectra .",
    "hence , depending on the absorption along a particular line - of - sight , one would expect different observed values for each measurement of any photometric quantity , for example , the cosmic flux decrement @xmath0 . performing enough measurements of such a quantity for sources with ideally identical seds at a fixed redshift",
    ", one could in principle estimate its mean and its scatter due to stochastic effects in the absorption by neutral hydrogen in the igm .",
    "the numerical realisation of this thought experiment is best achieved through monte carlo simulations . following _",
    "@xcite , and , we generate thousands ( @xmath43 ) of lines - of - sight each with a random population of hi absorbers , and compute the absorption along each of them for a given input spectrum at a fixed redshift .",
    "the population of each line - of - sight consists of a random number @xmath44 of absorbing systems , each of them characterized by three parameters : its redshift @xmath45 , its column density @xmath46 , and its doppler parameter , where @xmath47 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath48 is the kinetic temperature of the gas and @xmath49 is the mass of the hydrogen atom .",
    "the redshift and column density characterising each absorber are drawn from a distribution of the form @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a normalization constant .",
    "this function defines the 1-dimensional distribution of the hi present in the igm probed by a random line - of - sight .",
    "the number @xmath52 of systems for each line - of - sight is drawn from a poisson distribution with parameter @xmath53 where the integral is carried out over appropriate redshift- and column density intervals @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively .",

    "we define the following measure    @xmath124    where the @xmath125 s are the quantiles determined from the set of random numbers distributed normally , the @xmath126 s are the corresponding quantiles of the @xmath118 values at a given redshift that result from our simulations , and @xmath127 is the number of quantiles . by definition",
    ", @xmath128 explicitly gives the absolute deviation of one data set as characterised by these 11 quantiles with respect to the other data set , and thus quantifies the departure of the assumed distribution .",
    "indeed , the smaller the value of @xmath128 , the larger the probability that both data sets belong to the same parent distribution .",
    "the values of @xmath128 computed in this way turn out to lie in the range @xmath129 , which may seem vanishingly small .",
    "however , since the distribution of the random variable @xmath128 itself is unknown , we determine the significance of the results by generating two sets of normally distributed random numbers with mean and standard deviations distributed uniformly , and comparing them to the values found for our simulated data .",
    "we do this for @xmath130 pairs of sets , and determine from these what is the fraction of realisations with a value of @xmath128 smaller than a given value . according to these estimates , there is a probability of @xmath131 that a value @xmath132 will be produced by chance , respectively . in figure",
    "[ fig : del ] we show the values for @xmath128 as a function of redshift for the full mmc model , assuming a lognormal parent distribution for @xmath0 ( heavy solid line ) .",
    "the result are qualitatively the same for the bmc model and are not shown for clarity .",
    "note that for the whole redshift range shown , @xmath133 , and in particular @xmath134 for @xmath135 .",
    "it follows from the central limit theorem that the larger the number of absorbers @xmath52 , the closer the approach of the distribution of @xmath87 to a lognormal distribution , since the distribution of @xmath136 approaches a gaussian .",
    "given that @xmath52 increases with redshift , it should be expected that the accuracy with which the distribution of @xmath87 approaches a lognormal distribution also increases with redshift .",
    "furthermore , if the integral in equation ( [ eq : cfd2 ] ) is approximated by a sum of the form @xmath137 where @xmath138 is the number of pixels , it is apparent that for a sufficiently large @xmath138 , and assuming that @xmath87 has the same mean value @xmath139 and dispersion @xmath140 at each pixel , the distribution of @xmath99 should approach a gaussian distribution with mean @xmath139 and dispersion @xmath141 . since the width of a given restframe wavelength range , _",
    "i.e. _ the number of pixels also increases with redshift as @xmath31 , it is expected that the approximation of the distribution of @xmath99 and hence of @xmath0 to a gaussian becomes better with increasing redshift .",
    "we thus have the superposition of two effects : on the one hand , the distribution of @xmath87 at a fixed wavelength approaches a lognormal distribution at any given redshift , with the accuracy increasing with redshift .",
    "on the other hand , the distribution of @xmath99 and @xmath142 approaches a gaussian distribution with increasing redshift .",
    "the net result should be that @xmath99 and @xmath0 are distributed lognormally at low redshifts , and that their distribution approaches a gaussian for higher redshifts .",
    "since @xmath0 asymptotically converges to unity for very high redshifts , its distribution at these redshifts is expected to be highly peaked around the mean value .",
    "this is naturally given by the fact that the dispersion of @xmath99 scales like @xmath141 around @xmath139 , and that @xmath138 increases with redshift , as stated above . in order to test this expectation ,",
    "we compute the analytical lognormal ( gaussian ) probability distribution of @xmath0 as given by equation ( [ eq : log ] ) with the mean and standard deviation of @xmath118 ( @xmath0 ) computed using equations ( [ eq : mea ] ) and ( [ eq : std ] ) from the ensemble of values that result from our simulations at each redshift .",
    "the comparison of the analytic distribution thus obtained to the distribution of simulated @xmath0 values is shown for the full mmc model in figure [ fig : fdd ] .",
    "the results for the bmc model are qualitatively the same and are hence not shown . note the excellent agreement at all redshifts between the lognormal probability distribution and the distribution of the @xmath0 values resulting from our simulations .",
    "we want to emphasize that the curves shown are not fits to the binned data , but are computed using only the mean and standard deviation of the unbinned data . at lower redshift , the agreement at the lower cut - off , _",
    "i.e. _ at @xmath143 is worth mentioning .",
    "it is remarkable that this cut - off , which is physically given by the fact that absorption as measured by @xmath0 can not take on values smaller than zero , arises in a natural way due solely to the fact that @xmath0 is distributed lognormally .",
    "note , in contrast , that a gaussian distribution does not satisfactorily describes the distribution of the data at these low redshifts ; in particular , the gaussian distribution does not display the sharp cut - off at @xmath143 . nevertheless , the description of the data by a gaussian distribution becomes better with increasing redshift , as expected , and also the corresponding gaussian distribution becomes narrower at every increasing redshift ( taking into account the change in the scale of the @xmath144-axis from the first to the last panel ) .",
    "moreover , note that the analytic lognormal and gaussian distribution become visually indistinguishable from each other at @xmath145 . in order to assess quantitatively the differences between these distributions with respect to the distribution of the data",
    ", we compute again the value of @xmath128 at each redshift , assuming now that the @xmath0 values obtained from the mmc model are drawn from a gaussian parent distribution .",
    "we compare these values to the corresponding values computed before for an assumed lognormal parent distribution .",
    "this comparison is shown in figure [ fig : del ] . as can be seen ,",
    "the values of @xmath128 for both distributions are low at all redshifts , and the difference between them at @xmath146 is negligible small .",
    "this explains why the lognormal and gaussian distribution functions shown in figure [ fig : fdd ] are practically indistinguishable from each other .",
    "however , note that the values of @xmath128 for a assumed gaussian parent distribution become vanishingly small with increasing redshift , eventually becoming smaller than the corresponding values for the lognormal distribution . besides , it can be see also that the @xmath128 values for a assumed lognormal distribution rise again towards high redshifts , implying that the distribution of the data at these redshifts is no longer well described by a lognormal distribution.this confirms our statement made above , that @xmath0 is expected to be distributed lognormally at low redshifts and normally at higher redshifts .",
    "the redshift at which the transition from a lognormal to a gaussian distribution takes place may depend on the particular set of input distributions used . for redshifts where",
    "the distribution of @xmath0 is well approximated by a lognormal distribution , the optical depth should be distributed normally .",
    "this result is however not in agreement with the results from _",
    "* his figure 1 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their figure b1 ) , or ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their appendix c ) , where the distribution of the mean flux , _ i.e. _ the averaged transmission factor @xmath99 is claimed to be highly inconsistent with a gaussian distribution .",
    "it is usually assumed that the presence of the high - density lyman limit systems is responsible for this behaviour , and we next make use of our simulations to address this question .      in order to quantify the effect that the llss have on the distribution of @xmath0 ,",
    "we compare , following the analysis of section [ sec : dda ] , the results of the simulations for the mmc model with and without the optically thick llss .",
    "we find that @xmath0 is lognormally distributed as well with a high confidence for the case where the llss are excluded , as can in figure [ fig : del ] , where the values for @xmath128 computed at each given redshift are shown .",
    "again , the results for the bmc model are qualitatively the same and are omitted here .",
    "note that the values of @xmath128 for the mmc model without llss are larger at redshifts @xmath147 than those for the full mmc model .",
    "this is due to the fact that the absence of the optically thick llss enhances the probability of the attenuation factor @xmath148 to be closer to unity at a given wavelength along a random line - of - sight .",
    "this means effectively that the number of factors in equation ( [ eq : msk ] ) are reduced .",
    "hence , when the llss are absent , the approach to a lognormal distribution should be worse with respect to the case where the llss are included .",
    "furthermore , this effect should be enhanced towards lower redshifts , for which the number of factors , _ i.e. _ of absorbers decreases as @xmath149 .",
    "note that the trend is the opposite in the case of a assumed gaussian parent distribution .",
    "we hence find when computing the evolution of @xmath0 with the mmc model with and without llss that the predictions for the evolution of @xmath0 with redshift for the full mmc model are practically indistinguishable from the results of the mmc model without llss , which implies that the effect of these systems on the total absorption is small .",
    "furthermore , it turns out that the distribution of @xmath0 is lognormal irrespective of the presence of llss .",
    "all these results point to the fact that the lls have a negligible impact on the evolution of @xmath0 , as long as the input distributions used here correctly describe the number density evolution of the absorbers .",
    "this would confirm similar results already found by @xcite .",
    "also , as pointed out by @xcite , the picture would not be fundamentally different if higher column density systems such as damped ly@xmath2 systems were present .",
    "we will come back to this point in section [ sec : res ] .",
    "+ we think that , as long as the distribution functions realistically describe the evolution of the ly@xmath2 absorbers , the llss _ can not _ truly have a great impact neither on the absorption as measured by @xmath0 , nor on its statistics because of the following reasons : 1 ) they are scarce , and even more compared to the thinner ly@xmath2 forest systems ( _ e.g. _ of the order of 5 llss on average along a random line - of - sight compared to approximately @xmath150 ly@xmath2 forest absorbers out to @xmath151 , according to the mmc model ) ; 2 ) their contribution to the absorption is due solely to the absorption at the resonant wavelength of the ly@xmath2 line , and the equivalent width of the ly@xmath2 absorption line arising in systems with column densities @xmath152 is not too different from that of the systems with column densities @xmath153 ( cf . the curve - of - growth in figure [ fig : cog ] ) , which are by far more numerous . in order to estimate the relative contribution of each population at a given redshift , we weight the equivalent width @xmath154 of the ly@xmath2 absorption line as a function of the column density @xmath138 and doppler parameter @xmath57 with the column density distribution , and compute the ratio @xmath155 where @xmath156 here , @xmath157 is the distribution function of population , @xmath158 is the rest equivalent width of a ly@xmath2 absorption line for a column density @xmath138 and doppler parameter @xmath57 , and @xmath159 and @xmath160 are the column density limits that define each population , respectively . for a reasonable value for the doppler parameter of @xmath161 , and the input distributions of the mmc model , we find that @xmath162 at all redshifts .",
    "the result is qualitatively the same for the bmc model .",
    "hence , it follows from these models that the ly@xmath2 forest systems dominate the absorption over the optically thicker lyman limit systems at all epochs .",
    "this would explain at least in part why the difference between the predictions for @xmath0 from the mmc model with and without llss , is small .",
    "also , it is consistent with the theoretical expectation that the distribution of @xmath0 should not be far from lognormal or gaussian , with or without llss , since this only depends on the fact that the absorption factor be expressed in the form of equation ( [ eq : msk ] ) , and this is truly independent of the form of the input distributions , as stated previously .",
    "we expect the intrinsic scatter in the absorption due to cosmic variance to be strongest at lines - of - sight of middle length . at low redshifts , both",
    "the number of thin ly@xmath2 forest clouds and thick lyman limit systems is small , and the addition of a few more does not change dramatically the amount of absorption .",
    "however , the mean number of ly@xmath2 forest clouds and lls increases with @xmath8 , and thus the probability of encountering more or less systems than average increases as well . correspondingly , the absorption increases and so does its scatter . at even higher redshifts ,",
    "the number of ly@xmath2 forest systems increases so dramatically and the absorption is so severe that the addition of more systems does not make any difference neither to the absorption nor to the scatter .",
    "thus , we should expect the stochastic effect , _",
    "i.e. _ the scatter in absorption , to peak at some intermediate redshift @xmath163 .",
    "we compute the intrinsic scatter at the @xmath104 level for the values of @xmath0 at each given redshift obtained from our simulations using equations ( [ eq : mul ] ) , ( [ eq : sdl ] ) , ( [ eq : mea ] ) , and ( [ eq : std ] ) .",
    "the result is shown in figure [ fig : sca ] , where we show the evolution of the scatter in @xmath0 with redshift for the mmc model with and without llss .",
    "we also include for comparison the result from the bmc model .",
    "it can be seen that , irrespective of the model , the scatter peaks at a intermediate redshift between @xmath164 and @xmath165 .",
    "note that the peak is significant , since it represents an increase in the scatter of 2.5 times with respect to its value at @xmath166 .",
    "it is interesting that this result had also been found by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their figure 2 ) , who using a semi - analytic approach and different input distributions , reported that @xmath167 is largest at redshifts near 3.7 .",
    "thus , the qualitative behaviour of the intrinsic scatter of @xmath0 shown in figure [ fig : sca ] may be an unavoidable feature of this observable , which could explain at least in part the large scatter in the measurements of @xmath0 seen in the same redshift interval ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig : daz ] ) .",
    "as will be shown in section [ sec : res ] , however , there is a disagreement at the @xmath168 level between the _ amplitude _ of the scatter in the observations at these redshifts and that predicted by the models .",
    "when comparing models that only differ by the presence of the optically thick lyman limit systems , we find that the scatter in @xmath0 is larger at any given redshift when the lls are present , as expected .",
    "none the less , the absolute value of the scatter does not differ significantly between the situation where these systems are present and where they are absent .",
    "thus , the net effect of the llss is to enlarge the intrinsic scatter in the absorption , contributing only marginally to the mean value of the absorption itself .",
    "however , note that for redshifts @xmath169 , the amount of scatter at the 1@xmath104 level becomes indistinguishable between both scenarios , owing to the fact that the thinner ly@xmath2 forest systems are overwhelmingly more numerous at these redshifts",
    ".    the results stated above are consistent with the previous conclusion obtained from our simulations that the optically thick llss can not have a great impact on the absorption as measured by @xmath0 and on its scatter .",
    "we want to compare the predictions for the evolution of @xmath0 that result from the models described above to observations . for this purpose , we use previous measurements of @xmath0 reported in the literature , and we perform ourselves new measurements of this quantity , using qso spectra from the sdss data release 5 @xcite , thus extending the redshift range of the measurements to @xmath42 . our selection procedure of sources suitable for this purpose was as follows : since the wavelength range available from sdss ( dr5 ) is @xmath170 { \\ , \\mathrm{nm}}$ ] , and we measure the continuum depression @xmath0 in the restframe wavelength interval @xmath171 { \\ , \\mathrm{nm}}$ ] , the redshift of our sample is restricted to @xmath172 .",
    "we choose @xmath173 as our lowest redshift in order to avoid the low s / n at the blue end of the spectrograph .",
    "a simple query for high - z quasi - stellar objects on the sdss skyserver spectroscopic query form with this restriction alone returns around 2400 spectra . from this first selection , we rejected those objects for which the redshift was either not measured , the measurement had failed , or the measured photometric and spectroscopic redshifts were inconsistent with each other .",
    "we binned the quasars in redshift intervals of @xmath174 and selected for each redshift bin the spectrum with the highest s / n , leaving us with 28 sources , from which we removed three further objects due to low data quality .",
    "the resulting sample is listed in table [ tab : qso ] .",

    "@xcite found by constructing a composite qso spectrum from 284 hst fos spectra that a single power - law describes well the continuum for wavelengths between 105 and 220 nm with @xmath179 , but that the continuum steepens ( flattens in @xmath180 ) significantly for @xmath181 ( @xmath182 ) .",
    "similarly , @xcite reported , using a sample nearly twice as large as the @xcite s sample , that the continuum in the extreme uv region between @xmath183 and @xmath184 and in the near uv between @xmath185 and @xmath186 is well described by a single power - law with @xmath187 and @xmath188 , respectively .",
    "furthermore , by constructing a composite qso spectrum from a homogeneous sample of over 2200 sdss qsos , @xcite concluded that the continuum in the rest - frame wavelength range @xmath189 can be very well modeled by a single power - law either in wavelength or frequency , with @xmath190 .",
    "however , they did not estimate a spectral index for wavelengths @xmath191 . while it is the consensus that the optical / nir continuum of quasar spectra is due to synchrotron emission @xcite ,",

    "the observed soft x - ray / uv / optical spectral shape of quasars is found to be consistent with free - free emission of optically thin gas at temperatures @xmath192 k @xcite , which is well described by a power - law . on the other hand",
    ", it has been argued that the emission from a geometrically thin , optically thick accretion disk also reproduces well the observed quasar sed in this spectral region @xcite .",
    "either model , however , is consistent with an underlying continuum in the form of a power - law .",
    "alternatively , as already mentioned in section [ sec : cfd ] , other authors prefer to fit quasar continua locally using spline functions ( see _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",

    "as long as the assumption of the underlying power - law holds , this approach has the advantage that the continuum estimate is completely independent of the spectral resolution and s / n in the ly@xmath2 forest region .",
    "nevertheless , this method may lead to an systematic overestimate of the continuum flux and thus to an corresponding overestimate of @xmath0 .",
    "it follows from the results quoted above that the quasar s intrinsic continuum in spectral regions below and above the ly@xmath2 emission line may both be well described by power - laws , but with potentially different spectral indices .",

    "the validity of this assumption will be tested in the next section by the comparison of @xmath0-measurements to the results of our simulations , in which the absorption due to metal lines is not included .",
    "we compute the evolution of @xmath0 in the redshift interval @xmath225 using the models mmc ( with and without lyman limit systems ) and bmc presented in the section [ sec : mod ] , which include the effect of different populations of absorbers , _",
    "i.e. _ ly@xmath2 forest clouds and lyman limit absorbers . for comparison , we include also the values of @xmath0 computed using @xcite s model ( see section [ sec : rev ] ) . we refer to this model as mtc . for the mmc ( with and without lls ) and bmc models ,",
    "we simulate an ensemble of @xmath117 lines - of - sight at fixed redshift , and compute for each of them the flux decrement @xmath0 according to equation ( [ eq : daz ] ) . in this way we get for each given redshift an ensemble of an equal number of @xmath0 values for each model , from which we estimate the 50 per cent quantile ( median ) , and the @xmath122 , and @xmath123 per cent quantiles around the median , which correspond to the @xmath226 and @xmath227 ranges .",
    "we do not compute the mean and @xmath104 ranges in the standard way , since the distribution of @xmath0 is strictly speaking unknown a priori .",
    "however , according to the results from section [ sec : mod ] , the distribution of @xmath0 is not too far from a lognormal or even a gaussian distribution ; hence , the identification of mean with median , of @xmath16 range with the @xmath228 quantile around the median , and so on , is justified .",
    "since the mtc model only provides a ( mean ) transmission function at each redshift , we compute for this model one single value for @xmath0 at each redshift by numerically integrating the corresponding transmission function in the restframe wavelength range @xmath229 { \\ , \\mathrm{nm}}$ ] .",
    "we compare our simulations to measurements of @xmath0 accumulated in the literature over the past two decades , performed with different methods and approaches .",
    "this compilation is by no means intended to be complete .",
    "the reason for choosing these measurements is mainly that they were performed in more or less mutually exclusive redshift ranges which all together cover the range @xmath230 .",
    "our measurements extend this redshift range out to @xmath42 .",
    "therefore , these previous measurements together with our own allow a comparison to the models presented here over a wide redshift range , but with the caveat that using measurements from different groups may introduce an artificial bias in the evolution of @xmath0 due to the differences in the particular method used and the different redshift ranges probed in each case , as previously mentioned .",
    "the literature data and our measurements are shown together with our model calculations in figure [ fig : daz ] ( see cited references for details on the corresponding measurements ) . as can be seen in this figure , the predictions for the evolution of the mean @xmath0 from all three models , mmc , bmc , and mtc , are practically indistinguishable from each other when compared to observations for redshifts @xmath147 .",
    "we do not include in this figure the predictions for @xmath0 based on the mmc model without llss , since the difference between this and the full mmc model is negligible . at higher redshifts ,",
    "the values of @xmath0 obtained from the mmc and mtc models match the observations quite well .",
    "note that in spite of the fundamentally different approaches and input physics of these models , their results are very similar . as a result ,",
    "it is not possible yet to discriminate between these models due to the uncertainty and the strong scatter in the observations , especially around @xmath164 ( cf .",
    "section [ sec : sca ] ) .",
    "in contrast to the mmc and the mtc models , the predictions from the bmc model strongly deviate from the measurements of @xmath0 at @xmath231 , _ underestimating _ the absorption . since the mmc and bmc models differ only in terms of the input distributions and not in terms of the method , this result suggests that the evolution of the ly@xmath2 absorbers implied by the input distributions of the bmc model is slower than expected from the evolution of @xmath0 ( cf .",
    "equation [ eq : pwl ] ) .",
    "if used to compute the magnitude changes for high - redshift galaxies due to intergalactic absorption as done by _",
    "e.g. _ , the difference in the predicted evolution of @xmath0 between the mmc and bmc models corresponds to a difference of slightly more than 0.6 mag in the predicted magnitude change for _",
    "e.g. _ an sd - type galaxy with a constant star formation rate at @xmath232 in the f450w filter .",
    "the corresponding difference between the mmc and mtc model amounts to less than 0.3 mag .",
    "it is worth mentioning at this point that , in contrast to previous models ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we explicitly avoid normalising in any way the used distributions to match the observed @xmath0 at some given redshift , or manipulating the models whatsoever to satisfy any other restriction .",
    "we simply take the distributions as reported in the literature , where they were determined directly by means of line statistics by the authors and references therein .",
    "we mention this in order to emphasize the rather good agreement between the observations and the evolution of the mean @xmath0 predicted by all three models at @xmath233 , and by the mmc model at higher redshifts , further reinforced by the similarity between the results of the mtc and the mmc models , which are completely independent from each other .",
    "we include in figure [ fig : daz ] the empirical fits of @xcite of the form @xmath234 with @xmath34 and @xmath35 and of @xcite of the form @xmath235 with @xmath236 and @xmath237 .",
    "these empirical fits match the observations quite well at @xmath238 , and may be useful as a rough estimate of the mean absorption at those redshifts .",
    "however , as stated before , they should be taken with caution , especially at high redshifts . while @xmath0 asymptotically converges to unity as the redshift approaches the epoch of reionisation , @xmath239 ,",
    "these empirical fits diverge .",
    "in contrast , the predicted evolution of @xmath0 from all models described above does satisfy the expected and observed asymptotic behaviour .",
    "the rate of convergence to this limiting value certainly depends on the particular set of input distributions used , as shown by the comparison between the mmc to the bmc model . in general , the stronger the number density evolution , the faster the convergence . in other words ,",
    "different input distribution functions imply different values for @xmath38 , and this information may be used as a further constraint on the accuracy of a particular set of input distributions . extending the computations of the evolution of @xmath0 with the mmc model to redshifts @xmath240 , it turns out that @xmath0 is almost unity at @xmath241 .",
    "this value is slightly higher than the value of 6.5 quoted by @xcite for the epoch of reionisation .",
    "the compilation of @xmath0 measurements shown in figure [ fig : daz ] displays a large scatter at all redshifts , in particular at redshifts @xmath231 .",
    "previously , concerns were raised about the possibility that the amplitude of the intrinsic scatter due to cosmic variance may be enhanced by combining measurements performed with different methods and using heterogeneous data samples .",
    "hence , we select a subset from our compilation following the criteria stated below , and compare this observations to the scatter as predicted by our simulations . the results of this comparison are summarised in figure [ fig : daz2 ] . here",
    ", we show the redshift evolution of @xmath0 as computed from the mmc model .",
    "we include the 50 per cent quantile , _ i.e. _ the median , and the @xmath228 , and @xmath123 per cent quantiles , which correspond to the @xmath242- , and @xmath227 ranges around the median at each redshift .",
    "again , the difference between the predictions of the mmc with and without llss is negligible , and thus we show only the results for the full mmc model .",
    "we do not include the bmc model in this analysis in view of the disagreement with the observations at redshifts @xmath231 .",
    "our new data subset consists of our own measurements together with the measurements of @xcite , who use power - law fits to estimate the continuum level of the quasars , and of the measurements from @xcite , who fit the continuum locally using b - splines .",
    "we select these measurements for the following reasons : @xcite s data allow a more direct comparison to our data due to the similarity in method to estimate @xmath0 ; @xcite s data are the most recent and accurate measurements of @xmath0 available to date .",
    "furthermore , these data sets individually cover the largest redshift ranges , and together they constitute the smallest set of individual measurements fully spanning the redshift range @xmath243 with some overlap . within the quoted uncertainty ,",
    "the observations are well matched by the evolution of @xmath0 as predicted by the mmc model in the redshift range @xmath244 , with the exception of some outliers around @xmath245 , where the scatter of our observations alone as well as the scatter in the full sample of measurements is large , as can be seen in figure [ fig : daz ] .",
    "it is apparent from figure [ fig : daz2 ] that the largest scatter in the observed values of @xmath0 at a given redshift can not be ascribed to the _ intrinsic _ scatter in the absorption due to variations from one line - of - sight to another as computed with the mmc model , not even at the @xmath246 level . nevertheless , note that this is only the case for @xcite s and our measurements , while @xcite s measurements are all nicely contained within the @xmath227 envelope of the model .",
    "this suggests that the observed scatter or at least part of it is not real , but only an artifact introduced by combining observations based on different methods to measure @xmath0 .",
    "this assumption is supported by the small amplitude of the scatter in the distribution of high - redshift galaxy colors already found by ( cf .",
    "their figure 6 ) for a variety of input distribution functions . also , the fact that @xcite s measurements are well matched by the mmc model points to the fact that the particular method chosen by @xcite and ourselves to estimate the continuum in the ly@xmath2 forest region does introduce a bias in the measurements of @xmath0 . on the one hand",
    ", there is very likely a bias do to the already discussed systematic overestimate of the continuum level .",
    "furthermore , neither @xcite nor we corrected our corresponding measurements for metal - line absorption",
    ". these facts together would explain in part why precisely our and their measurements are higher on average than the median value of @xmath0 predicted by the mmc model , as can be seen in figure [ fig : daz2 ] . even though its effect is expected to be small , including the absorption of metal lines should eventually increase the agreement between the results from the models and the observations .",
    "there is thus rather strong evidence that most of the amplitude in the observed scatter in @xmath0 displayed in figures [ fig : daz ] and [ fig : daz2 ] is introduced by combining measurements performed on heterogeneous data samples using different methods .",
    "if real , however , the observed scatter would indicate that the models , in particular the mmc model , can not account for the variation of @xmath0 among different lines - of - sight , even though it reproduces well its _",
    "mean _ redshift evolution . according to the results from our simulations ( cf .",
    "section [ sec : dda ] ) , it is expected that @xmath0 as predicted by the mmc model be lognormally distributed with a high confidence at redshifts @xmath247 , and consequently , that @xmath118 and hence the optical depth of hi should obey a gaussian distribution .",
    "however , this result is not supported by the observations given the poor agreement between the scatter predicted by the mmc models and the observed distribution of @xmath0 at a given redshift .",
    "on the other hand , the expectation that @xmath0 should be either lognormally or gaussian distributed is based solely on the fact that the transmission factor be written in the form of equation ( [ eq : msk ] ) , which is certainly independent of the particular model accounting for the evolution of the ly@xmath2 absorbers .",
    "a different set of input distribution functions may have an effect on the mean value and the spread of the distribution of @xmath0 at each redshift , but not the on the form of the distribution .",
    "it may be thus possible that a different ( more accurate ) set of input distribution functions of the absorber properties may help to reconcile the lack of agreement between the _ amplitude _ of the predicted and the observed scatter , but even in this case the disagreement regarding the _ form _ of the distribution when compared to previous studies ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) remains .",
    "even though the amplitude of the observed and simulated scatter do not quite match , it is interesting to note that the redshift at which the intrinsic scatter in evolution of @xmath0 peaks ( cf . figure [ fig : sca ] ) roughly coincides with the redshift at which the observations show a strong scatter ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig : daz ] ) .",
    "this redshift matches the redshift at which @xcite reported a local decrement in the evolution of the ly@xmath2 optical depth @xmath114 , recently confirmed by @xcite , which has been interpreted by @xcite as a signature of the reionisation of .",
    "note , however , that at this redshift the @xmath0 measurements lie predominantly above the mean value as given by the models ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig : daz ] ) , and hence the trend suggested by these observations is exactly the opposite from that found by @xcite , since a decrease in @xmath114 implies a decrease in @xmath0 .",
    "this strongly indicates that the difference in method and the heterogeneity of the samples of the different surveys does introduce an artificial bias in the observed evolution of @xmath0 , in particular in its scatter .",
    "we finally want to highlight the following curiosity : by taking a close look at figures [ fig : sca ] and [ fig : daz2 ] it becomes apparent that the maximum in the evolution of @xmath167 roughly coincides with the point of inflection of the curve that describes the expected redshift evolution of the mean @xmath0 .",
    "mathematically , this would imply that the intrinsic scatter of @xmath0 is proportional to the rate of change of the mean @xmath0 with redshift , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath248 indeed , if one computes numerically the derivative of @xmath249 with respect to @xmath8 , it turns out that it qualitatively matches the evolution of @xmath250 , up to a scale transformation .",
    "a physical interpretation may be gained in light of equation ( [ eq : pwl ] ) : a rapid evolution of the absorbers , quantified by the parameter @xmath39 , implies a stronger evolution of @xmath0 with @xmath8 .",
    "since the evolution is however different in general for different lines - of - sight , this in turn implies a larger variation in the absorption from line - of - sight to line - of - sight , and thus a larger value of @xmath250 .",
    "this is mathematically consistent with the fact that the scatter given by the derivative of equation ( [ eq : pwl ] ) with respect to @xmath8 is proportional to @xmath39 .",
    "1 .   we measured the cosmic flux decrement @xmath0 and its uncertainty due to statistical and systematic errors for 25 qsos of the sdss dr5 catalog in the redshift range @xmath251 .",
    "we modeled the redshift evolution of the mean @xmath0 and its distribution at each given redshift in a monte carlo fashion , adopting two among the various models presented by @xcite .",
    "we found that the predictions of the mmc model for the evolution of the mean @xmath0 reproduce well the observations in the range @xmath243 , in contrast to the bmc model .",
    "we conclude from this that the underlying input distributions of the bmc model may not accurately account for the evolution of the ly@xmath2 absorption on the igm .",
    "hence , estimates of the impact of the intergalactic attenuation on the photometric properties of high - redshift galaxies using this particular model should be taken with caution .",
    "incidentally , by showing the rather good agreement between one particular set of simulations and the data , we show the power of the relatively simple approach used here to model the effect of intergalactic absorption , as compared to models based on hydrodynamical simulations which are by far more complex .",
    "3 .   through the comparison between the mmc and bmc models",
    ", we showed that different input distribution functions may have very different predictions regarding the evolution of @xmath0 , a quantity which is intimately related and hence very sensitive to the amount of hi present along the line - of - sight .",
    "therefore , we state that any model of the intergalactic absorption should first of all reproduce the observed evolution of @xmath0 and its distribution before it is used to _",
    "e.g. _ correct synthetic or observed spectra for intergalactic absorption .",
    "the results from our simulations suggest that the distribution of @xmath0 at a given redshift be well described by a lognormal distribution at low redshifts and by a gaussian distribution at high redshifts , in agreement with our theoretical expectation based on the fact that the absorption is mathematically expressed as the product of small , statistically independent factors .",
    "this result implies that at redshifts where @xmath0 is distributed lognormally , the effective optical depth of the intergalactic hi should obey a normal distribution , contrary to the results of previous studies .",
    "however , this result should be taken with caution in light of the fact that the models , in particular the mmc model , can not reproduce the amplitude of the observed scatter in @xmath0 . 5 .",
    "we argue that most of the observed scatter in @xmath0 is introduced by combining measurements based on different methods .",
    "nevertheless , the reason for the lack of agreement between the scatter predicted by the mmc model and the observed distribution of @xmath0 is not ultimately settled .",
    "because of this and until this discrepancy is clarified , we may warn about using any attenuation model based on the input distributions of the mmc model to estimate magnitude changes in the spectra of background sources .",
    "a larger , homogeneous sample of accurate measurements of @xmath0 over a wide redshift range is needed in order to allow for a more faithful comparison to models , and in particular , to determine the intrinsic _ form _ and _ amplitude _ of the distribution of @xmath0 as a function of redshift .",
