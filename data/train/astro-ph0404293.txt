    "the amounts of the light elements li , be , and b ( libeb ) at present are thought to be the sum of the products of the big bang nucleosynthesis and the subsequent cosmic - ray spallation reactions .",
    "the contribution from the big bang nucleosynthesis to @xmath5li is thought to be most pronounced among these three elements . though some fractions of li have been depleted inside some cool stars , its abundances on the surfaces of metal - poor stars are the only information that we can use to identify the contribution from the big bang nucleosynthesis ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus it is important to know the contribution from the cosmic - ray spallation reactions to li in the early stages of the galaxy evolution during which metal - poor stars were formed . with this knowledge",
    ", we can constrain the cosmological parameters to synthesize light elements in the big bang nucleosynthesis @xcite .",
    "in addition , the investigation of the evolution of these elements in the early stages of the galaxy enables us to understand the origin of cosmic - rays responsible for the light element nucleosynthesis .",
    "recent observations of extremely metal - poor stars apparently suggest that the primary ( not secondary ) spallation process dominated the light element nucleosynthesis in the early galaxy @xcite . in other words , cosmic - rays composed of c / o interacting with protons and/or he nuclei in the interstellar medium ( ism )",
    "have predominantly produced libeb . a primary mechanism , in which libeb were produced in supernova ejecta - enriched superbubbles ,",
    "was suggested to explain the be evolution in the early galaxy @xcite . since then , two - component models in which light elements are produced by standard galactic cosmic - rays and metal - enriched particles in superbubbles have been investigated by several authors @xcite .",
    "these studies concluded that a primary mechanism is needed to explain the observed abundance trends of be and b with o and fe .",
    "recently , @xcite investigated the chemical evolution of libeb in the early epoch of the galaxy using an inhomogeneous chemical evolution model developed by @xcite in which star formation is assumed to be induced by supernova ( sn ) explosions .",
    "their model succeeded in reproducing not only the observed metallicity distribution of galactic halo stars but also the observed abundance correlations of heavy elements .",
    "@xcite also considered two origins of galactic cosmic - rays that synthesize light elements .",
    "one is from the ism accelerated by sn shocks , and the other from sn ejecta accelerated by the sn shock .",
    "the authors claimed that @xmath62 % of galactic cosmic - rays must be originated from the sn ejecta to reproduce the behavior of the abundance of be at the metal - poor ends .",
    "however , their model suffers from shortage of energy supply from each sn to cosmic - rays .",
    "moreover , the energy distributions of the cosmic - rays from these two origins might be different , though @xcite assumed they are the same .",
    "@xcite found from a numerical model of type ic supernovae ( sne ic ) @xcite that the outermost c / o layers of an sn could attain energies beyond the threshold value to produce libeb ( @xmath630 mev per nucleon for o@xmath7h@xmath8be , which corresponds to the lorentz factor of @xmath61.03 ) .",
    "energetic explosions of massive stars with stripped h - rich and he layers might be able to produce cosmic - rays enriched with c / o in the outermost layers of ejecta . in the model of @xcite ,",
    "the outermost layers of the ejecta do not become so relativistic .",
    "it may , however , be attributed to their coarse zoning in the outermost layers , which has to be as accurate as possible for this purpose .",
    "furthermore , their numerical calculations were performed with a hydrodynamic code that does not take into account relativistic effects .",
    "thus it was impossible to accurately estimate the contribution from sne ic to the light element nucleosynthesis with their results .",
    "the phenomena taking place when the supernova blast wave hits the surface of a relatively compact star were investigated in a more sophisticated fashion by @xcite and @xcite with their radiation - hydrodynamic codes .",
    "their codes allow the radiation and the gas to go out of equilibrium . both of their codes were non - relativistic except that they included light - travel - time corrections .",
    "they were concerned with the shock breakout of sn 1987a , because the most detailed observations immediately after the shock breakout were available for this sn .",
    "one of their main objectives was a detailed modelling of the uv burst immediately after the shock emergence .",
    "in addition to these numerical approaches , there have been semi - analytic approaches to the shock emergence in the plane - parallel medium in which the flow is assumed to be self - similar @xcite .",
    "@xcite took into account the sphericity of the flow in a neighborhood of the surface .",
    "these semi - analytic approaches are also limited to the non - relativistic flow .",
    "after the emergence of a very bright type ic supernova , sn 1998bw , was found to be associated with a @xmath9-ray burst grb 980425 @xcite and @xcite inferred from their radio observations that the radio shock front of sn 1998bw was moving at relativistic speeds with the lorentz factor between 1.6 and 2 , the relativistic motion from supernova explosions has been investigated .",
    "@xcite estimated how much mass of relativistic ejecta could be obtained from the explosion of a massive star and derive an empirical formula giving the mass of relativistic ejecta from explosions of stars with simple polytropic density structures .",
    "later , @xcite revised the empirical formula using their relativistic hydrodynamic code",
    ". their formula would give @xmath10 of relativistic ejecta ( lorentz factor @xmath11 ) from the explosion of a star with a mass of @xmath12 and an energy of @xmath13 ergs .",
    "using the empirical formula of @xcite for the energy distribution of sn ejecta , @xcite concluded that sne ic , especially energetic events like sn 1998bw significantly contribute to light element nucleosynthesis through spallation reactions .",
    "the energy distribution of particles in sn ejecta used in @xcite follow a power law with a power index of @xmath14 .",
    "this power index is quite different from that of the energy distribution of the ism accelerated by sn remnant shock ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "then @xcite adopted a `` thick target '' approximation instead of solving the cosmic - ray transfer equation to derive the yields of libeb from the energy distribution of sn ejecta .",
    "there still remain some problems to be addressed in their work ; the model for stellar structures @xcite assumed is so simple that it involves suspicions of inaccurate estimates .",
    "in addition , they set the adiabatic index @xmath9=constant over the whole stages of explosions , which may vary according to the physical conditions and affect the resultant energy distribution of the ejecta .",
    "our objective is to construct a realistic model for sn ejecta moving at relativistic speeds and to investigate their contribution to light element syntheses . to improve the above situations ,",
    "we calculate the energy distributions of ejecta as a result of sn explosions using a relativistic hydrodynamic ( rhd ) code with realistic numerical models for massive stars as the initial conditions .",
    "the atmospheres in radiative equilibrium are attached to the original models for massive stars ( see references in table [ tbl - model ] ) .",
    "this is essential to investigate the energy distribution of ejecta at highest energies after the shock breakout .",
    "we also verify the validity of @xmath9=constant by using more realistic equation of states that incorporates radiation and ideal gas in thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "to investigate the change of the energy distribution of relativistic ejecta transferring in the ism , we solve the transfer equation that takes into account the energy loss due to ionization and spallation reactions . from these calculations ,",
    "the amounts of synthesized libeb through primary spallation reactions are obtained .    in the next two sections ,",
    "we describe our rhd code in lagrangian coordinates (  2 ) and initial conditions (  3 ) .",
    "then , we show the results in  4 , compare them with that of other authors , and discuss the differences . in  5 , we estimate the yields of libeb using our explosion models together with the leaky box model .",
    "we have constructed a numerical code for rhd in lagrangian coordinates based on the formalism presented in @xcite .",
    "our rhd code well reproduces the exact solutions of test problems presented in @xcite , such as relativistic shock tubes .      in eulerian coordinates , equations of rhd of a perfect fluid can be written in the following form : @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 denote the time , the rest - mass density , the momentum density , and the energy density in a fixed frame where the fluid moves at speed @xmath22 , respectively .",

    "the number of zones are listed in table [ tbl - model ] . to obtain accurate energy distributions of sn ejecta above the threshold energies for cosmic - ray spallation reactions , our models have zones in the outermost layers with masses well below @xmath57 .",

    "to check our numerical code , we have performed a calculation for a type ii sn 1987a and compare the resultant velocity distribution as a function of enclosed mass with that calculated by @xcite with a non - relativistic hydrodynamic code .",
    "results of these two calculations are found to be in agreement to a fairly good accuracy ( @xmath730.2 % on average ) .",
    "the explosion energy has been found to be considerably higher than 10@xmath74 ergs from modelling the observed light curve and spectra of sn 1998bw .",
    "asphericity has been suggested from the observed feature of emission lines of o and fe @xcite .",
    "the fact that spherical models can not explain the light curve both in the early and late phases also suggests an aspherical explosion : the spherical explosion with an energy of @xmath75 ergs can explain the early phases but the light curve was predicted to decline too fast to be compatible with the observations , while that with a lower energy @xmath76 ergs can not evolve as fast as observed in the early phase but can explain the observed decline of the late light curve @xcite .",
    "here we have calculated an explosion of a @xmath77 c / o star with an explosion energy @xmath69 of @xmath78 ergs for this energetic supernova ( table [ tbl - model ] ) .",
    "the mass of the ejecta @xmath67 becomes 13@xmath79 with the rest of @xmath80 collapsed to become a compact object at the center .",
    "the resultant energy distributions of the ejecta are plotted in figure [ fig - fieldsa ] with that predicted from the empirical formula proposed by @xcite : @xmath81 where @xmath82 denotes the mass of ejecta that have particle energy per nucleon greater than @xmath83 .    at the high energy tail , the energy distribution from our calculation with realistic equation of states ( the dashed line in fig .",

    "thus this agreement is ascribed to the features of this particular model that the density distribution of the star is well approximated by a simple formula presented in @xcite and that the adiabatic indices in the shocked ejecta are close to 4/3 . at around the threshold energies for spallation reactions ( @xmath87@xmath88 mev / nucleon )",
    ", the energy distribution from our calculation significantly deviates from equation ( [ eqn - fields ] ) ( see fig . [ fig - fieldsa ] ) .",
    "therefore , it is doubtful to use equation ( [ eqn - fields ] ) to estimate yields of light elements synthesized by the spallation reactions .",
    "the explosion of this supernova is so furious that the assumption of @xmath89 already breaks down in this energy region . in summary ,",
    "equation ( [ eqn - fields ] ) always overestimates the mass with given @xmath83 .",
    "in particular , it overestimates the mass with @xmath83 greater than the threshold energies by a factor of @xmath3 .",
    "the other type ic supernovae listed in table [ tbl - model ] are explosions with explosion energies per unit mass smaller than sn 1998bw model .",
    "the energy distribution of the ejecta of these supernovae follow a power law with the same index in equation ( [ eqn - fields ] ) but with a significantly greater amount of matter accelerated to given energies per nucleon .",
    "a low @xmath90 leads to adiabatic indices in the shocked matter greater than 4/3 .",
    "the stiffer equation of states leads to a more efficient acceleration .",
    "the same is true for a model of sn 1998bw with a less explosion energy ( e.g. @xmath91 ergs ) as shown in figures [ fig - fieldsb ] and [ fig - ai ] . as a result ,",

    "this will affect the ratios of light elements synthesized from the cosmic - ray spallation reactions ( see  [ sect - yields ] ) .    from the discussion in the preceding sections",
    ", it follows that equation ( [ eqn - fields ] ) holds when the adiabatic index is very close to 4/3 and @xmath94 .",
    "in particular , our calculations show that the energy distribution does not become a simple power - law for @xmath95 .",
    "this must be due to the fact that the simple stellar density distribution @xcite assumed can reproduce the density distributions in realistic stellar model only for the outer 0.001 % layers in mass . when the explosion energy is furious , the adiabatic index is close to 4/3 but the mass with @xmath83 greater than the threshold energies for spallation reactions can become significantly greater than @xmath96 as in sn 1998bw model .",
    "thus equation ( [ eqn - fields ] ) does not give a good estimate for the mass of ejecta in the region between @xmath83 and @xmath97 around the threshold energies ( @xmath92 ) as well as @xmath82 .    the smaller the explosion energy per unit",

    "our calculations for all the models listed in table [ tbl - model ] with a constant adiabatic index equal to 4/3 always result in the energy distributions of ejecta in good agreement with their fitting formula at high energy tails irrespective of values of @xmath90 .",
    "therefore this deviation should be caused by variable adiabatic indices . at the same time",
    ", the agreement of these results with equation ( [ eqn - fields ] ) suggests that the simple density distributions used in @xcite are good approximations of realistic stars in the outermost layers ( 0.001 % of the ejecta mass ) .    from our calculations with a realistic equation of state ( eq .",

    "thus a single fitting formula such as equation ( [ eqn - fields ] ) can not account for all the realistic explosions .",

    "this fraction should have been a factor of @xmath4 higher in the early stage of the galaxy for furious sne ic to have been a major production site for be .",
    "the element abundance ratios b / be from the present models consistent with those for galactic halo stars indicate that the same is true for b in the halo .",
    "the observed number ratios li / h on the surfaces of metal - poor stars suggest that the big bang nucleosynthesis leads to li / h@xmath176 and have a significant correlation with the metallicity @xcite .",
    "if this correlation is extrapolated to [ fe / h]@xmath177 , then the ratio li / h becomes @xmath178 .",
    "therefore the amount of li produced in the galactic halo was @xmath179 , where @xmath180 denotes the mass of h. thus an argument similar to the preceding section results in the yield of li per unit supernova mass of @xmath181 the corresponding value of sn 1998bw model is @xmath182 and the other models give less values .",
    "if this value in equation ( [ eqn - li ] ) is taken at face value , sne ic can not produce this amount of li .",
    "however , there seem to be few stars with the metallicity range of @xmath183[fe / h]@xmath184 for which the li abundance is measured @xcite .",
    "we need to wait for abundance information in this metallicity range to deduce a firm conclusion .    at the low metallicity end ( [ fe / h ] @xmath185 ) , the observed li / o ratios @xmath186 @xcite are more than two orders of magnitude greater than that in our sn 1998bw model ( see table [ tbl - yields ] ) .",
    "the li produced from this primary mechanism is likely to be negligible compared to the primordial li .",
    "we have performed numerical calculations for sne ic explosions using a relativistic hydrodynamic code to investigate how much mass of ejecta is accelerated beyond the threshold energy for spallation reactions to synthesize light elements . in our calculations ,",
    "realistic massive star models are used as the initial conditions of sne and the eos takes into account the thermal radiation and ideal gas .",
    "we have compared the resultant energy distributions of ejecta with the empirical formula derived in @xcite for some sn explosions including furious and normal sne and found that the energy distributions of ejecta from the numerical calculations and the empirical formula agree only in the high energy tail when the explosion energy per unit ejecta mass significantly exceeds @xmath187 . otherwise , the empirical formula overestimates or underestimates the ejecta mass at around the threshold energy for spallation reactions .",
    "therefore it is necessary to numerically calculate sn explosions to obtain a correct energy distribution of ejecta for estimations of the yield of light elements .    to obtain the yields of light elements from the calculated sn ejecta",
    ", we have numerically solved the transfer equation taking into account the energy loss due to ionization of the ism and spallation reactions with the ism .",
    "the results suggest that light elements synthesized from energetic sne ic like sn 1998bw by this mechanism can explain the enrichment of be and b observed in the galactic halo stars if the fraction of sn 1998bw like sne in the early galaxy was a factor of @xmath4 higher than current observational data suggest .",
    "this mechanism must not be the only primary mechanism that worked in the galactic halo .",
    "other primary mechanisms like superbubbles that supply light elements regardless of sn type are required to reproduce the observed abundance ratios such as be / fe . these sne ic can produce li with more than one order of magnitude smaller amounts than indicated by observations . however , lack of information on the li abundances in the metallicity range of @xmath183[fe / h]@xmath184 prevents us from deducing a firm conclusion .",
    "sne are suggested to be associated with aspherical explosions .",
    "the deviation from spherical symmetry will be able to increase the mass of ejecta with enough energies for spallation reactions for a given @xmath90 because @xmath82 is proportional to the @xmath1883.6 power of this value . to illustrate this effect ,",
    "a simplified situation will be considered .",
    "suppose the energy injected in the direction with a solid angle of @xmath189 steradian is enhanced by a factor of two and the energy in the other directions is reduced by a factor of @xmath190 , then the empirical formula for the mass @xmath82 indicates that this mass will increase by a factor of @xmath191 while the total energy will be unchanged .",
    "applying the empirical formula obtained from the spherically symmetric calculations to this situation might lead to an erroneous result .",
    "thus to further explore sne ic as a production site for light elements , we need to perform multi - dimensional relativistic hydrodynamic calculations for sne ic that can trace the motion of the outermost ejecta with a sufficient accuracy such as the calculations presented here ."
