    "group iii - nitrides semiconductors have potential applications in optoelectronics and microelectronics devices .",
    "nitride semiconductors epilayers grown along the @xmath4 @xmath0-axis of the wurtzite crystal structure suffer from strong undesirable spontaneous and piezoelectric polarization fields , which give rise to internal electrical fields @xcite and impair device performance . in quantum wells these fields",
    "spatially separate the electrons and holes reducing the overlap of their wave functions , and causing a reduction of the recombination efficiency and red - shift of the emission peak in light - emitting devices @xcite .",
    "a solution to avoid the deleterious polarization - induced electric field effects is to use group - iii nitride layers in crystal orientations which have no polarization field in the growth direction , and hence across the device active region @xcite .",
    "therefore , there is extensive ongoing research towards the growth of  non - polar \" @xmath5 @xmath1-plane and @xmath6 @xmath2-plane ( @xmath7-axis ) group iii - nitrides .",
    "these non - polar @xmath1- or @xmath2-plane epilayers are generally grown on @xmath8- or @xmath2-plane sapphire substrates respectively . the lattice mismatch and thermal expansion coefficients of these nitride epilayers with respect to the substrate",
    "are different along @xmath9 and @xmath7-directions .",
    "this gives rise to an _ anisotropic _ in - plane strain which distorts the basal - plane of the hexagonal unit cell .",
    "similar anisotropic differences in lattice mismatch and expansion coefficients also exist within the different members of the iii - nitride family , hence there is an anisotropic in - plane strain even when growing for example an @xmath1-plane algan epilayer on a @xmath1-plane gan buffer layer .",
    "the distortion of the basal plane has also been observed for similar reason in case of @xmath0-plane gan grown on @xmath1-plane sapphire substrate @xcite .    in @xmath0-plane oriented films ,",
    "epilayers are under uniform in - plane strain , which deforms the unit cell but preserves the hexagonal symmetry of the basal plane . in that case",
    "the determination of lattice parameter and estimation of group iii molar fraction in the ternary alloy ( for example al content of algan films ) is relatively straightforward @xcite .",
    "however , for the non - polar orientations , the anisotropic in - plane strain results a distortion of the wurtzite unit cell which breaks the hexagonal symmetry .",
    "further , the orientation of the @xmath1-plane nitride epilayer on @xmath8-plane sapphire substrate results in a reduced number of available lattice points in the reciprocal space within the limiting - sphere that are accessible for diffraction measurements .",
    "this makes determination of lattice parameters for non - polar nitrides and consequently the estimation of group iii composition of non - polar nitrides very difficult @xcite .",
    "a few different procedures for lattice parameter determination of such structures have been discussed in the literature .",
    "darakchieva et al .",
    "@xcite detail a procedure that requires measuring several symmetric and skew - symmetric planes at multiple azimuth positions in an edge - symmetric geometry .",
    "another approach by roder et al.@xcite uses measurements of interplanar spacings derived from a combination of 9 symmetric , asymmetric , and skew - symmetric reflections , which are weighted by their corresponding fwhm values and used in a fitting routine to match to an orthorhombic structure via an error minimization routine . in this paper",
    "we suggest a slightly different procedure for measuring the lattice parameters for such distorted systems using high resolution x - ray diffraction ( hrxrd ) .",
    "we first show that the anisotropic strain results in an orthorhombic distortion of the unit cell , and derive a general expression for the interplanar distance @xmath10 in such structures . using the interplanar distances determined from multiple symmetric and skew - symmetric reflections , we obtain the lattice parameters via a standard least - square error minimization routine that is easily implemented in standard mathematical software packages using a matrix formulation .",
    "we also derive an approximate expression for the ternary alloy composition of al@xmath11ga@xmath12n epilayers , where the al content @xmath3 is obtained solving the stress - strain tensor taking into account the anisotropic strain .",
    "the procedure is illustrated using measurements on @xmath1-plane algan epilayers grown on aln buffer layers on r - plane sapphire substrates .",
    "we also show that the procedure is applicable for @xmath2-plane nitrides as well .",
    "the algan epilayers were grown via metal organic vapour phase epitaxy ( movpe ) in a @xmath13 closed - coupled showerhead reactor .",
    "trimethylgallium ( tmga ) , trimethylaluminium ( tmal ) , and ammonia ( nh@xmath14 ) are used as precursors and pd - diffused hydrogen ( h@xmath15 ) as carrier gas .",
    "about @xmath16 thick algan epilayers were grown on aln buffer layer .",
    "the details of the growth procedure can be found in ref .",
    "the lattice parameters measurement were carried out by using a philips xpert@xmath17 high resolution x - ray diffractometer with a symmetric ge(@xmath18 ) hybrid monochromator and an asymmetric triple - axis analyzer and pixcel solid state detector array .",
    "the 2@xmath19 value of a set of planes @xmath5 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath20 , @xmath5 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 were measured to confirm the orthorhombic distortion and to estimate the lattice parameters .",
    "absorption measurements were done on backside polished samples using a cary @xmath28 spectrophotometer to estimate the band gap of the epilayers .",
    "fig 1(a ) shows a schematic diagram of the relative unit cell orientation of an @xmath1-plane iii - nitride epilayer on @xmath8-plane sapphire .",
    "the in - plane epitaxial relationships between the group iii - nitride layer and sapphire are @xmath29_{nitride}$ ] @xmath30 @xmath31_{sapphire}$ ] and @xmath32_{nitride}$ ] @xmath30 @xmath33_{sapphire}$ ] .",
    "the thermal expansion co - efficients in the respective directions and the lattice mismatch are shown in the table 1 .",
    "it is evident that the lattice and thermal mismatch along @xmath29 $ ] and @xmath32 $ ] are different which gives rise to the anisotropic strain in the overlayer and thus distorts the basal plane of the unit cell as shown schematically in fig 1(b - c ) ( solid line ) .",
    "further , the thermal mismatch along @xmath0 ( @xmath34}|$ ] ) and along @xmath2 ( @xmath35}|$ ] ) are larger for gan / aln compared to the gan / sapphire and aln / sapphire cases .",
    "( a ) schematic diagram showing the orientation of wurtzite unit cell of @xmath5 @xmath1-plane oriented nitride epilayer on @xmath36 @xmath8-plane sapphire substrate .",
    "anisotropic in - plane strain results orthorhombic distortion and requires at least three lattice parameters @xmath37 ( sidewall ) , @xmath38 ( top ) and @xmath0 for complete description of the unit cell .",
    "( b - c ) the dotted lines and solid lines show the basal plane of a perfect and distorted hexagonal unit cell respectively .",
    "( b ) a choice of coordinate axis that involves four independent lattice variables @xmath1 , @xmath39 , @xmath0 and @xmath40 , whereas in ( c ) symmetry allows the reduction of one parameter ( @xmath1=@xmath39 ) and gives a simpler expression for @xmath10 and also helps to visualize the lattice points in the reciprocal space.,width=529 ]    .thermal expansion and lattice mismatch [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the measurement shows that the value of @xmath3 estimated from xrd and optical transmission agrees within @xmath41 .",
    "the @xmath3 is slightly lower than the @xmath42 because of parasitic reaction between tmal and nh@xmath14 .",
    "a detailed discussion of the variation of strain and distortion with al - content , and its effect on the microstructure is discussed in references @xcite and @xcite , and is not presented here as the emphasis of this work is to discuss the procedure rather than the results .",
    "in conclusion , we have observed that the anisotropic in - plane strain results in an orthorhombic distortion in the wurtzite unit cell for non - polar @xmath1-plane nitrides . we have suggested a quick method for confirming such a distortion to be orthorhombic , and derived an expression for @xmath10 value for such distorted unit cells .",
    "we have also provide relatively simple procedure for estimation of accurate lattice parameters using multiple reflections and minimizing the error by a least square method . since the orthorhombic distortion creates a difficulty for estimating group iii content in ternary alloys , we have presented a technique which estimates the the correct al content in @xmath1-plane algan films taking into account the effect of anisotropic strain .",
    "we have also shown that this method is equally applicable for @xmath2-plane nitrides as well .",
    "these procedure should be valuable to researchers working on a wide range of non - polar iii - nitride epilayers .",
