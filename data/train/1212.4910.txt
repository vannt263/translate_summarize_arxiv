    "relativistic flows appear in many high - energy astrophysical phenomena , such as jets from microquasars and active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , pulsar winds , magnetar flares , core collapse supernovae , and gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) . in many of these systems",
    ", the magnetic field has a crucial role in dynamics .",
    "for example , magnetic fields connecting an accretion disk with a central star , or , different points of accretion disks are twisted and amplified due to the differential rotation , launching the jets @xcite .",
    "the production of astronomical jets has been observed in magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations @xcite .",
    "the jets are also powered by a subtraction of the rotational energy of a central black hole via the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "also the magnetic fields play an important role in accretion disks to transport the angular momentum outward , leading to the mass accretion @xcite    not merely the observational point of view , but the radiation field is also an important ingredient in the dynamics of relativistic phenomena",
    ". the radiation pressure force would play a key role in jet acceleration .",
    "recently , @xcite showed a formation of radiatively accelerated and magnetically collimated jets using non - relativistic radiation mhd ( rmhd ) simulations ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the radiative effect also plays important roles in non - relativistic phenomena .",
    "for example , the dominance of the radiation pressure in optically thick , geometrically thin ( standard ) accretion disks could be unstable to thermal and viscous instabilities @xcite . here",
    "we note that the global radiation hydrodynamic ( rhd ) simulations showed the growth of instabilities @xcite , but @xcite concluded that the radiation pressure dominated region is thermally stable using rmhd simulations of a local patch of the disk .",
    "thus the high energy phenomena would be understood only after we take into account the magnetic field and the radiation consistently .",
    "many methods have been proposed to include radiative effects in non - relativistic plasmas .",
    "solving a full radiation transfer equation is the most challenging task for directly connecting results between numerical simulations and observations @xcite .",
    "but it is a hard task to couple with the hydrodynamical code due to its complexity and high computational costs .",
    "another class of simple method is based on the moment method . in the flux - limited diffusion approximation ( fld ) , a 0th moment equation of the radiation transfer equation",
    "is solved to evaluate the radiation energy density , @xmath0 . the radiative flux , @xmath1 , is given based on the gradient of the radiation energy density without solving the 1st moment equation .",
    "this is quite a useful technique and gives appropriate radiation fields within the optically thick regime , but we should keep in mind that it does not always give precise radiation fields in the regime where the optical depth is around unity or less ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "thus it is better to solve the 0th and 1st moment equations .",
    "when we solve two moment equations , the closure relation , @xmath2 , is used to evaluate the radiation stress , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the eddington tensor . in the eddington approximation ,",
    "the tensor is simply given by @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the kronecker delta .",
    "this implies that the radiation field is isotropic in the comoving frame , which is a reasonable assumption in the optically thick media .",
    "another class of the eddington tensor is obtained by approximately taking into account the anisotropy of radiation fields ( so called m-1 closure , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . implemented the m-1 closure in their non - relativistic hydrodynamic code and demonstrated that the anisotropic radiation fields around an obstacle are accurately solved .    in the framework of relativistic radiation hydrodynamics ( rrmhd ) ,",
    "@xcite first proposed a numerical scheme for solving general relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamic equations assuming an optically thick medium ( i.e. , @xmath7 ) .",
    "@xcite implemented the general relativistic radiation hydrodynamics code and adopted it for the bondi - hoyle accretion on to the black hole .",
    "recently , @xcite proposed another truncated moment formalism of radiation fields in optically thick and thin limits .    in the rr(m)hd , there are three independent timescales .",
    "the first one is the dynamical time scale @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the typical size of the system and the fluid velocity .",
    "the second one is the timescale at which the characteristic wave passes the system , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the characteristic wave speed .",
    "these two timescales are comparable and close to the light crossing time , @xmath13 ( where @xmath14 is the speed of light ) in relativistic phenomena ( i.e. , @xmath15 ) .",
    "the third one is the heating / cooling and scattering timescales , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "these timescales become much shorter than the dynamical one in the optically thick medium , since the gas and the radiation are frequently interact .",
    "this indicates that equations for the radiation fields become stiff . in the explicit scheme",
    ", a numerical time step @xmath18 should be restricted to being shorter than these typical timescales ( @xmath19 $ ] ) to ensure the numerical stability .",
    "therefore , high computational costs prevent us from studying long term evolutions when the gas is optically thick , if we are interested in the phenomena of the dynamical timescale .    in this paper",
    ", we propose an explicit - implicit numerical scheme overcome this problem . as the first step , we consider the relativistic radiation hydrodynamics by neglecting the magnetic field ( but , see section [ discussion ] for the discussion how to extend our numerical scheme to rrmhd ) .",
    "the proposed scheme ensures a conservation of total energy and momentum .",
    "governed equations are integrated in time using both explicit and implicit schemes .",
    "the former solves an hyperbolic term ( timescale @xmath20 ) .",
    "the latter treats the exchange of energy and momentum between the radiation and the matter via the gas - radiation interaction , whose time scales are @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "this method allows us to take a larger time step @xmath23 than that of the explicit scheme .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in   [ method ] , we introduce argument equations for rrhd and the numerical scheme is shown in   [ numerical ] .",
    "numerical results of one- and two - dimensional tests are shown in ",
    "discussion and summary are appeared in   [ discussion ] and   [ summary ] .",
    "in the following , we take the light speed as unity .",
    "the special relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamic equations of ideal gas consist of conservation of mass , @xmath24 conservation of energy - momentum , @xmath25 and equations of radiation energy - momentum @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the proper mass density , @xmath28 is the fluid four velocity , and @xmath29 and @xmath30 are energy momentum tensors of fluid and radiation . here",
    "@xmath31 is the bulk lorentz factor and @xmath32 is the fluid three velocity .",
    "greek indices range over @xmath33 and latin ranges over @xmath34 , where @xmath35 indicates the time component and @xmath34 do space components .",

    "the energy momentum tensor of radiation is written as @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 are the radiation energy density , flux and stress measured in the laboratory frame .",
    "the radiation exchanges its energy and momentum with fluids through absorption / emission and scattering processes .",

    "@xmath50 and @xmath51 are absorption and scattering coefficients measured in the comoving frame .",
    "thus , equation ( [ geq : tradcons ] ) is a mixed - frame radiation energy - momentum equation that the radiation field is defined in the observer frame , while the absorption and scattering coefficients are defined in the comoving frame .    in equations ( [ geq : g0 ] ) and ( [ geq : gi ] ) , we assume the kirchhoff - planck relation so that the emissivity @xmath52 is replaced by the blackbody intensity @xmath53 as @xmath54 in the comoving frame .",
    "the blackbody intensity @xmath53 is a function of gas temperature @xmath55 as @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is related to the stefan - boltzmann constant @xmath58 .",
    "the plasma temperature is determined by @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the boltzmann constant and the proton mass , and @xmath62 is the mean molecular weight .",
    "since we consider the moment equation of radiation fields , we need another relation between @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath63 to close the system , i.e. , the closure relation . here",
    "we leave it as a general form described by @xmath64 where dash denotes the quantity defined in the comoving frame .",
    "the explicit form of closure relation is introduced in   [ closure ] after the formulation .    in the following , we deal with the one - dimensional conservation law in the @xmath65-direction :",
    "@xmath66 which follows equations ( [ geq : mcons ] ) , ( [ geq : tcons ] ) , and ( [ geq : tradcons ] ) .",

    "the total energy density @xmath76 and momentum density @xmath77 are given by @xmath78 and @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 denote the energy and momentum density of the fluids , respectively .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath43 and @xmath82 are not only the primitive variables , but also the conserved variables .",
    "thus , it is straightforward for the radiation fields to convert the primitive variables from the conserved variables , as we will see in   [ sc : source ] .",
    "in this section , we propose a new numerical scheme for solving rrhd equations .",
    "a conservative discretization of 1-dimensional equation ( [ geq:1dform ] ) over a time step @xmath18 from @xmath83 to @xmath84 with grid spacing @xmath85 is written as @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the conservative variable at @xmath88 and @xmath89 , and @xmath90 is the upwind numerical flux at the cell surfaces @xmath91 . in the numerical procedure , we divide equation ( [ eq:1ddif ] ) into two parts , the _ hyperbolic term _ @xmath92 and the _ source term _ @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the conservative variable at the auxiliary step . in the following subsection ,",

    "when we take @xmath97 and @xmath98 , the numerical solution is reliable with a first order accuracy in space .    in order to improve the spatial accuracy ,",
    "primitive variables at the zone surface @xmath99 are calculated by interpolating them from a cell center to a cell surface ( the so - called reconstruction step ) .",
    "the primitive variables at the left and right states are written as @xmath100 where we take @xmath101 with the plus ( minus ) sign .",

    "for example , they correspond to the sound speeds for the relativistic hydrodynamics .",
    "when the radiation field is included , the light mode determines the fastest wave speed , which depends on the closure relation .",
    "the fastest wave speed is discussed after specifying the closure relation in   [ closure ] .",
    "we note that although we adopted the hll scheme for simplicity , the higher order approximate riemann solvers such as the hllc @xcite and hlld @xcite can be implemented in the relativistic radiation ( magneto)hydrodynamics @xcite .    using the numerical flux @xmath116",
    ", the conserved variables @xmath117 is obtained from equation ( [ geq : fluxterm ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that the total energy density @xmath118 and momentum density @xmath119 at @xmath120 are already solved although we only integrate the hyperbolic term .",

    "the source term appears in equation ( [ geq : tradcons ] ) , which treats the interaction between the radiation and the matter . as discussed in",
    "  [ intro ] , the heating / cooling and scattering timescales can be shorter than the dynamical timescale in optically thick media .",
    "it prevents us from studying the long time evolution ( @xmath121 ) when the equation is explicitly integrated . to overcome this difficulty",

    "the eddington tensor @xmath128 is generally a non - linear function of @xmath43 and @xmath44 , so we can not adopt the simple implicit method by replacing @xmath129 and @xmath130 in the eddington tensor .    in this paper , we propose an iterative method , which solves the following equation @xmath131 where @xmath132 indicates the iteration step .",

    "the explicit - implicit scheme of the relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamics with the m-1 closure will be reported in the near future .",
    "we have developed a numerical scheme for solving special relativistic radiation hydrodynamics , which ensures the conservation of total energy and flux .",
    "the hyperbolic term is explicitly solved using an approximate riemann solver , while the source term describing the interaction between the matter and the radiation , is implicitly integrated using an iteration method .",
    "the advantage of the implicit scheme is that we can take the numerical time step larger than the absorption and scattering time scale .",
    "this allows us to study the long term evolution of the system ( typically , the dynamical timescale ) .",
    "when integrating the source term , we need to invert matrices @xmath153 and @xmath209 in our proposed scheme .",
    "we have to note that the rank of these matrices used in the implicit scheme is very small ( @xmath146 for @xmath153 and @xmath213 for @xmath209 ) .",
    "this is because the interaction between the radiation and the gas is described by a local nature ( source term ) when we solve 0th and 1st moments for radiation .",
    "this means that the numerical code can be easily parallelized and a high parallelization efficiency is expected .",
    "we note that since the matrix @xmath153 is only @xmath146 matrix , we can invert it analytically . for the matrix @xmath209",
    ", it is relatively small matrix but it is difficult to invert it analytically .",
    "thus we decide to use lu decomposition method .",
    "since the lu decomposition method can invert the matrix directly without iterations , we obtain @xmath214 stably .",
    "we find that the wave front of radiation field can be sharply captured using the hll scheme even when we adopt the simple closure relation @xmath344 ( i.e. , the eddington approximation ) .",
    "when we adopt the fld approximations , such a sharp wave front can not be captured due to the diffusion approximations .",
    "thus , solving the 1st order moment of radiation has an advantage when we consider the optically thin medium although the wave speed reduces to @xmath277 and the radiation field is isotropic .",
    "we adopted the iteration scheme to integrate stiff source terms .",
    "if we need many counts in iteration scheme , it causes a load imbalance between each core when the code is parallelized .",
    "but we have to stress that solutions converged only within two steps even if @xmath255 for the problem of radiative heating and cooling appeared in   [ radheatcool ] .",
    "for the other tests , solution converges without iteration .",
    "thus we can expect that the load imbalance due to the iteration scheme is not severe even in the more realistic problems .    in the previous papers @xcite ,",
    "radiation fields are defined in different frames for primitive and conservative variables ( mixed frame ) .",
    "in such a method , the radiation moment equations are simply described . however , this method is not suitable for implicit integration .",
    "this is because that a lorentz transformation between two frames is needed . by the transformation ,",
    "expressions of the radiation fields become quite complex even if the eddington approximation is adopted . moreover ,",
    "the radiation stress tensor , pr , is generally non - liner function of the radiation energy density and the radiation flux through the eddington tensor .",
    "thus , extension of explicit method to implicit method is not straightforward for the relativistic radiation hydrodynamics .    in our method , we treat radiation fields in the laboratory frame , only .",
    "such a treatment simplifies implicit integration .",
    "although we need to invert @xmath208 matrix and @xmath146 matrix , our new method is easier than the method with mixed frame .",
    "two matrices of @xmath155 ( which is needed for implicit integration ) and @xmath345 ( which is needed to compute pr ) are directly inverted using analytical solution and lu - decomposition method . since we need not to use some iteration methods to invert them , our method is stable and comparatively easy .",
    "our method would be quite useful for numerical simulations of relativistic astrophysical phenomena , e.g. , black hole accretion disks , relativistic jets , gamma - ray bursts , end so on , since both the high density region and high velocity region exists , and since the radiation processes are play important role for dynamics as well as energetics .",
