    "fluid mechanics equations in its most popular form ( euler , navier - stokes , fourier - kirchhoff , burnett , etc ) appear in methods based on boltzmann kinetic equation by means of expansion in knudsen number(kn ) . the first important version of such theory was made by hilbert .",
    "it implies analiticity in kn of both distribution function as well as momenta functions .",
    "further development of the theory by chapman - enskog and grad @xcite weaken analiticity condition of the momenta on kn .",
    "it allowed to deride ns , burnett equations for the chapman - enskog method and 13 momenta grad equations widely used in fluid dynamics description .",
    "failures in deep knudsen regime penetration recovered by direct attempts with many - moment theories lead to more deep understanding of the problem @xcite .",
    "the knudsen independent expansion of the basic ( boltzmann ) equation was used , namely one of gross - jackson , starting from the celebrating bgk model .",
    "the unification of chapman - enskog and gross - jackson approaches@xcite exploits an idea of nonsingular perturbation method in its frechet expansion form @xcite .",
    "one of important verification of fluid dynamics system relates to the problem of sound propagation .",
    "its simplest version considers the plane harmonic wave with the correspondent dispersion relation . such case obtained by linearization of the basic system reproduces the known experiments of @xcite rather well .",
    "it incorporated in a direct scheme of kinetic approach @xcite .",
    "the fluid mechanics systems , based on bgk @xcite model of collision integral , obtained recently in @xcite and @xcite , give good results for velocity of sound in kn @xmath0 but fail in attenuation description @xcite .",
    "developing the method based on gross - jackson collision integral for a non - isotropic fluid for a problem , which specifies @xcite a direction in it we use an idea of von karman to divide the phase speed with respect of particle velocity direction along / against the direction axis @xcite .",
    "such situation takes place if a gas is stratified in gravity field , that yields appearance of interne gravity waves branch with the obvious necessity to account wide range of kn @xcite .",
    "struchtrup @xcite regularizes 13-moment grad equations doing the same thing as a test .",
    "his linearization results in a dispersion relation , which acoustic branch gives an attenuation coefficient that also does not fit experiments .",
    "our article is devoted to this problem ; we tried to improve the results on a way of next gross - jackson model @xcite , the tendency was good but the changes were not enough . considering an alternative possibility to compensate the discrepancy in relaxation timeestimation , we adress to the alexeev generalization of boltzmann equation @xcite .",
    "alexeev - boltzmann equation looks like : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the substantional(particle ) derivative , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the velocity and radius vector of the particle , respectively , @xmath5 is the mean time between collisions , @xmath6 is the collision boltzmann integral .",
    "we apply our method for the generalized boltzmann equation of alexeev and such `` joint '' theory gives a better agreement with the experimental data @xcite for attenuation at arbitrary knudsen number .",
    "consider the kinetic equation with the model integral of collisions in bgk form @xcite : @xmath7 here @xmath8 - local- equilibrium distribution function .",
    "@xmath9 denotes the average thermal velocity of particles of gas , @xmath10  is the effective frequency of collisions between particles of the gas at height @xmath11 , @xmath12  is a parameter of the gas stratification .",
    "it is supposed , that density of the gas n , its average speed @xmath13 and temperature @xmath14 are functions of time and coordinates .",
    "following the idea of the method of piecewise continuous distribution functions let s search for the solution @xmath15 of the equations([q1 ] ) as a combination of two locally equilibrium distribution functions , each of which gives the contribution in its own area of velocities space : @xmath16 here @xmath17 depending on @xmath18 are functional parameters .",
    "the double number of parameters of the distribution function results in its deviations from a local - equilibrium one . in the range of small knudsen numbers",
    "@xmath19 we should have @xmath20,@xmath21 , @xmath22 and distribution function start from a local equilibrium and at the small difference between the functional up and down parameters produces the navier - stokes equations .",
    "the theory is also valid at big kn(free molecular regime)@xcite .      here",
    "the first three functions are collisional invariants .",
    "let s define a scalar product in velocity space : @xmath25 @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the peculiar velocity . here",
    "@xmath28 is mass density , @xmath29 is the diagonal component of the pressure tensor , @xmath30 is a vertical component of a heat flux vector , @xmath31 is a parameter having dimension of the heat flux .",
    "the system ( [ q7 ] ) of the equations according to the derivation scheme is valid at all kn . to close the description",
    "it is enough to plug the two - side distribution function into ( [ q6 ] ) , that yields for @xmath17 as function of @xmath35 .",
    "we base here on an expansion in small mach numbers @xmath36 , up to the first order .",
    "the values of integrals ( [ q8 ] ) as functions of thermodynamic parameters of the system ( [ q7 ] ) are : @xmath37      let us report the results of investigation of quasi - plane waves parameters as a function of kn .",
    "for this purpose we proceed in a standart way : linearizing the system ( [ q7 ] ) that impose the dispersion relation as a link between frequency and complex wave number .          in figures 1 , 2 a comparison of our results of numerical calculation of dimensionless sound speed and attenuation factor depending on @xmath43",
    "is carried out in a parallel way with the results by other authors .",
    "the navier - stokes prediction is qualitatively wrong at big knudsen number .",
    "our results for phase speed give the good consistency with the experiments at all knudsen numbers .",
    "however , our results for the attenuation of ultrasound are good ( as we can see in experiment ) for the number r up to order unity and in the free molecular regime . taking into account disadvantages of model integral of collisions it is planed to consider kinetic equation with full integral of collisions",
    ". it will permit to describe processes in transition regime .",
