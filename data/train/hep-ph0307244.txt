    "core collapse supernovae are a huge source of all flavor neutrinos .",
    "neutrino astrophysics entered a new phase with the detection of neutrinos from the supernova sn1987a in the large magellanic cloud by the kamiokande and imb detectors @xcite . in spite of these fundamental neutrino observations ,",
    "the 19 events observed are not statistically significant enough to obtain precise quantitative information on the neutrino spectrum . currently running neutrino detectors like superkamiokande or sno have the capabilities to provide high statistics information about supernova and neutrino properties if a supernova collapse were to take place in the near future .",
    "the flavor composition , energy spectrum and time structure of the neutrino burst from a galactic supernova can give information about the explosion mechanism and the mechanisms of proto neutron star cooling .",
    "in addition , because neutrinos arrive before any other signal from a supernova , it is possible to provide an early alert to the astronomical community combining the observations of several experiments . this will allow an early observation of the first stages of the supernova explosion .",
    "the neutrino signal from a galactic supernova can also give information about the intrinsic properties of the neutrino such as flavor oscillations .",
    "although new data from solar , atmospheric , reactor and accelerator neutrinos @xcite have contributed to the understanding of the neutrino properties , still the neutrino mixing angle 13 and the nature of the mass hierarchy , i.e. , normal or inverted , remain unknown .",
    "these parameters can be probed by the observation of supernovae neutrino bursts , since neutrinos will travel long distances before reaching the earth and will , as they travel through the exploding star , in addition traverse regions of different matter densities where matter enhanced oscillations will take place . in the case of the 13 angle , matter enhancement has the striking feature that very small mixing angles , beyond any value detectable by next generation accelerators , could in fact alter significantly the neutrino spectrum .",
    "hence , supernova neutrinos provide indeed a complementary tool to study the 13 angle .",
    "the main question of course is to understand to which extend can the supernova and the neutrino physics be decoupled in the observation of a single supernova ?",
    "on one hand , the understanding of the supernova explosion mechanism is still plagued by uncertainties which have an impact on the precision with which one can predict time , energy and flavor - dependent neutrino fluxes .",
    "on the other hand , the intrinsic neutrino properties are not fully known , since the type of mass hierarchy and the value of the 13 angle are unknown , and in fact large uncertainty still exist on the prediction of the actual effect of neutrino oscillation .",
    "there have been various studies on future supernova neutrino detection and their interplay with neutrino oscillations physics .",
    "dighe and smirnov @xcite estimated qualitatively the effects of neutrino oscillations in a collapse - driven supernova on the neutronization peak , the distortion of energy spectra and the earth matter effect .",
    "dutta et al @xcite and also takahashi et al @xcite showed numerically that the total number of events for superkamiokande and sno detectors increases dramatically when there is neutrino mixing .",
    "detailed supernova simulations ( see e.g. @xcite ) indicate that the average neutrino energy is flavor dependent and hierarchical ( e@xmath5 @xmath6 e@xmath7 @xmath6 e@xmath8 ) .",
    "great uncertainties still exist in the spectral and temporal evolution of the neutrino fluxes . although the hierarchy of the average energies of the @xmath0 , @xmath3 and @xmath9 , @xmath10 is believed to hold , quantitatively their specific spectra remain a matter of detailed calculations ( see @xcite , and @xcite and references therein ) . under the assumption of hierarchical neutrinos",
    ", neutrino flavor oscillations should make the spectra of @xmath0 and @xmath3 harder ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this will lead to a change in the neutrino observations in the detector because the cross sections depend strongly on the neutrino energy and they are different for different flavors .",
    "it is hence well known that uncertainties in the supernova explosion mechanism and the effect of neutrino oscillations can change dramatically the number of observed events in a given experiment .",
    "indeed , this dependence can be used to determine the supernova and mixing parameters , once the next supernova has been detected .",
    "most detailed studies in the literature however concern water or heavy - water targets ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , some authors advocate the use of specific variables in order to disentangle supernova from neutrino oscillation physics ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    in this work",
    "we study the capabilities of a liquid argon tpc ( icarus - like ) to detect neutrinos from supernova collapses and its possible contributions to this field .",
    "our study is motivated by the proposed 3 kton icarus detector @xcite that should become operational at the gran sasso underground laboratory and by ideas for a very large liquid argon tpc with a mass in the range of 100 kton s ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we think that a liquid argon detector has excellent potentialities for supernova physics , namely because of its high granularity and bubble - chamber like features , all channels , namely elastic scattering off atomic electrons , as well as charged and neutral nuclear scattering processes are detectable and identifiable .",
    "the simultaneous observation of nuclear charged and neutral currents provide high - statistics and golden channels to decouple supernova from neutrino oscillation physics .    it is known that precise elastic scattering can also yield information on the flavor content of the flux ( see e.g. @xcite in the context of the solar neutrino puzzle ) , because of different cross - sections depending on flavor and helicity .",
    "however , this requires good statistical precision that is more difficult to achieve with target electrons than with nuclear target .",
    "hence , nuclear processes are expected to contribute most .",
    "a liquid argon tpc can also separate the various channels by a classification of the associated photons from the @xmath2 , @xmath4 or @xmath1 de - excitation , which exhibit specific spectral lines , or by the absence of associated photons in case of the elastic scattering .",
    "it is hence possible to detect @xmath0 , @xmath3 and other flavors independently .    in section  [ sec : framework ] , we briefly recall the general framework we used in this study",
    ". in particular , we identify five scenario for the cooling of the supernova .",
    "neutrino oscillations in vacuum and in the supernova matter are discussed in section  [ sec : matter ] .    in section  [ sec : signal ] , we discuss the relevant neutrino cross - section on argon and identify the experimentally detectable classes of events .",
    "new calculations on the cross section for the absorption processes based in the random phase approximation ( rpa ) were used allowing computing for the first time the contribution of the @xmath11 absorption reaction and of neutral current reactions .    in section  [ sec : burst ] , a particular interest is taken on detection of the early phase neutrino signal from supernova in liquid argon .",
    "we investigate the expected events coming from the first hundreds of milliseconds after the supernova bounce using the calculations on the shock breakout process in core collapse supernovae and taking neutrino oscillations into account .    in section  [ sec : cool",
    "] , we compute the expected neutrino rates in liquid argon , for different primary supernova neutrino fluxes scenarios .",
    "moreover , the energy spectra modified by oscillations are plotted for different conditions on the oscillation parameters . from supernova",
    "neutrino observations it is possible to extract information about the character of the mass hierarchy and the 13 mixing angle .",
    "when the iron core of a massive star ( m @xmath12 8 m@xmath13 ) overcomes its hydrodynamical stability limit ( the chandrasekhar mass ) , the core collapses raising its density up to many times the nuclear density . during this infall stage of the collapse ,",
    "a first @xmath14 burst is emitted ( `` _ infall burst _ '' ) , since the high density of matter enhances the electron capture by protons .",
    "the total energy radiated during this phase is roughly 10@xmath15 ergs .",
    "this emission does not continue indefinitely , since at a density @xmath16 10@xmath17 g @xmath18 neutrinos are trapped in the stellar core and go to equilibrium with matter .",
    "the anomalous density produces an elastic bounce of the core , which results in a shock wave .",
    "after the _ core bounce _ , also neutrinos of other flavors begin to be produced .",
    "the neutrinos are trapped in a region ( `` neutrinosphere '' ) whose size is different for different neutrino flavors . a deeper neutrinosphere corresponds to a higher temperature .",
    "the wave propagates through the star and loses energy in dissociating nucleons .",
    "when the shock crosses the @xmath14 neutrinosphere , an intense burst of @xmath14 ( `` _ shock breakout _ '' or `` _ neutronization burst _ '' ) is produced by electron capture on the large number of protons liberated by the shock .",
    "the characteristic time of the breakout burst is 310  ms and the total energy radiated in @xmath14 neutrinos during breakout is @xmath16 3 @xmath19 10@xmath15 ergs .",
    "after the breakout stage , the @xmath14 luminosity rapidly decreases , while the luminosities of other flavor neutrinos increase . at the end of the neutrino diffusion inside the mantle the energy is practically equally distributed between the various neutrino flavors .",
    "the shock wave stalls without driving off the stellar mantle and envelope . @xmath14 and @xmath20 are absorbed on the nucleons liberated by the shock .",
    "such processes supply new energy to the wave , which is revived @xmath16 500 ms after the bounce .",
    "this energy transfer is known as `` neutrino heating '' .",
    "continued mass accretion and convection below the shock wave also deposit energy ans thus contribute to the shock revival .",
    "the reinforced shock can propagate within the stellar matter and expel the external layers into the space .",
    "after the explosion the star loses energy , mainly by neutrino emission , and cools down , forming a neutron star or a black hole . this final stage ( `` _ cooling _ '' ) requires @xmath16 10 s and takes away @xmath21 99 % of the gravitational energy of the star ( @xmath16 24 @xmath19 10@xmath22 ergs ) .    in order to obtain quantitative estimates ,",
    "the following general considerations are taken into account for the present analysis :    * sn type - ii at a distance of 10 kpc ( galactic supernovae ) * gravitational binding energy of 3 @xmath19 10@xmath22 ergs ( radiated away as neutrinos ) .    in our analysis of the event rates and energy spectra , we simplify the supernova neutrino emission process and assume that it can be split into two distinct phases : the early @xmath0 pulse expected in the first 40 ms of the collapse ( _ shock breakout _ ) and the rest beyond the first 40 ms which we treat as a _ cooling stage _ , which could in reality last up to @xmath16 10  s.    * for the shock breakout we use the time - dependent energy spectra from burrows et al .",
    "the calculation is based on dynamical models of core collapse supernovae in one spatial dimension , employing a newly - developed boltzmann neutrino radiation transport algorithm , coupled to newtonian lagrangean hydrodynamics and a consistent high - density nuclear equation of state .",
    "full details of the simulation can be found in @xcite .",
    "recent studies on the initial mass progenitor dependence seem to indicate that the major features of the early neutrino burst should be almost independent of the initial mass of the star @xcite .",
    "* for the cooling stage we assume that the energy spectra of neutrinos is a fermi - dirac distribution . in order to take into account the uncertainties in the modelling of the cooling phase , we consider five different scenarios which correspond to simulations found in the literature .",
    "the various scenarios can be parameterized by different assumptions on the average energies and relative luminosities of the different neutrino flavors .",
    "table [ tab : sncoolscenario ] summarizes the different possibilities for the primary supernova neutrino flux parameters and neutrino average energies considered in this work .",

    "the expected number of events in the four neutrino detection channels are plotted for the five scenarios of the sn neutrino flux parameters considered in this study . moreover , the non oscillation and the four oscillation cases are plotted for every scenario .",
    "the plots are normalized to a supernova at 10 kpc and a 3 kton detector .",
    "the errors indicated in the picture correspond to statistical errors and give a visual feeling on the ability to separate the various supernova ( i  v ) and oscillation scenarios ( no osc , n.h .- l , n.h .- s , i.h .- l , i.h .- s ) .",
    "nc events are sensitive to the primary source parameters and are independent to the oscillation effects .",
    "they give a direct account for the total luminosity of the supernova and of the hardness of the neutrino spectra .",
    "hence , they provide the means to discriminate between the various supernova physics scenarios if the binding energy is assumed to be known .",
    "this is illustrated in the bottom plot of figure  [ fig : ratesall ] .",
    "the rates of the nuclear processes are such that excellent statistical precision is achieved .",
    "they amount to @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 events for resp .",
    "the scenarios i  v , where the error quoted is the statistical error on the number of events .",
    "the supernova and neutrino oscillation physics can then be studied by the simultaneous observation of nc , @xmath14 cc , @xmath45 cc and elastic channels .",
    "we observe :    * in the hierarchical scenarios ( i  ii ) the enhancement of @xmath14 due to oscillation is highly significant .",
    "as already mentioned , this is the result of the hardening of the spectrum in all cases of oscillations . * * the effect is of course the strongest in the case of n.h .-",
    "l for the @xmath0 and in the case of i.h .-",
    "l for @xmath20 . * * the normal and inverted hierarchy yield the same number of events in the case of small mixing . * in the non - hierarchical scenarios ( iii  v ) the enhancement of @xmath14 due to oscillation is significant compared to the non - oscillation case , except for scenario ( iv ) where the quasi - degenerate energies and the choice of luminosities l@xmath5 = l@xmath7 = 2 l@xmath27 with @xmath9 each of @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 neutrino flavors just washes out the oscillation ( the disappearing @xmath50 are compensated by the appearing @xmath51 ) . * in the scenario iv this ambiguity in the number of events can be solved by a study of the event energy distribution ( see figure  [ fig : schenother ] ) .",
    "indeed , the figure clearly shows that the spectrum is indeed harder for the oscillation case but that the total number of events is roughly the same .",
    "an analysis of the neutrino events expected in a liquid argon tpc ( icarus - like ) from a future galactic supernova has been performed showing the high capabilities of the detector to observe neutrinos from stellar collapses and extract information about their properties .",
    "four detection channels have been considered : elastic scattering on atomic electrons from all neutrino species , @xmath0 charged current absorption on @xmath1 with production of excited @xmath2 , @xmath3 charged current absorption on @xmath1 with production of excited @xmath4 and neutral current interactions on @xmath1 from all neutrino flavors .",
    "we give a detailed account of the dependence with the mixing angle 13 and the type of mass hierarchy .",
    "neutrino oscillations change significantly the expected supernova neutrino rates and energy spectra .",
    "the matter effects inside the supernova must be included to predict how the spectra of the neutrino burst is modified by oscillations .",
    "information about the supernova explosion mechanism can be obtained from the study of the neutrino burst .",
    "the early phase neutrino signal on argon has been computed using the fluxes from a realistic core collapse supernova model @xcite , and including oscillation effects .",
    "thanks to its clean identification and high sensitivity to @xmath0 neutrinos , a liquid argon tpc can provide fundamental information about the shock breakout mechanism .",
    "we find that a 70  kton detector is best suited to study the sn burst , given its statistics even in case of the @xmath0 suppression expected in case of oscillations .    for the cooling phase of the supernova , we have adopted a simple fermi - dirac parameterization of the neutrino fluxes .",
    "we selected six different scenarios in order to take into account the uncertainties on the knowledge of the supernova physics and estimate their effect on our analysis .",
    "for the study of the cooling phase , a 3  kton detector is sufficient to collect hundreds of events which could provide fundamental information on supernova and neutrino oscillation physics .",
    "we discussed how the various scenarios can be distinguished . in all cases ,",
    "we find that the simultaneous observation of the four channels , in particular nuclear charged and neutral current processes , is fundamental in order to decouple the supernova from the neutrino oscillation physics .    the observed event rates and the event energy spectra of the four classes of events form a set of observables sensitive to the supernova parameters and to the intrinsic neutrino oscillation parameters ( 13 and mass hierarchy ) .",
    "we have qualitatively illustrated this with several examples .    in order to understand quantitatively the sensitivity to such parameters , one should study the classification of actual detected events into the four channels and perform a global fit to the observed distributions .",
