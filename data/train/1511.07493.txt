    "superconductors without inversion symmetry have become one of the most studied classes of materials in the past decade , see ref . for a review and references .",
    "the long list of noncentrosymmetric superconductors includes compounds both with and without strong electron correlations , the former exemplified by the heavy - fermion materials cept@xmath0si ( ref . ) , ce(rh , ir)si@xmath0 ( ref . ) , and uir ( ref . ) , while the latter is represented by y@xmath1c@xmath0 ( ref . ) , li@xmath1(pd@xmath2,pt@xmath3)@xmath0b ( ref . ) , srptsi@xmath0 ( ref . ) , and many others .",
    "these materials have properties that are very different from the predictions of the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) theory of superconductivity , due to the qualitative changes in the electron band structure produced by the spin - orbit ( so ) coupling of electrons with the crystal lattice .",
    "the so coupling in a noncentrosymmetric crystal lifts the spin degeneracy of the electron states almost everywhere in the brillouin zone ( bz ) , producing nondegenerate bloch bands labelled by `` helicity '' and endowing the quasiparticle wave functions with a complex spin structure and a nontrivial momentum - space topology .",
    "this is responsible for a number of novel properties , such as the anomalous de haas - van alphen and hall effects in the normal state,@xcite the magnetoelectric effect,@xcite novel nonuniform superconducting states in the presence of magnetic field@xcite or even without any field,@xcite the topologically protected gapless boundary modes and quantum spin hall effect,@xcite and the unusual impurity response in the superconducting state.@xcite if the so splitting of the bands is large compared to all superconducting energy scales , then the cooper pairing occurs only between quasiparticles with the same helicity , with profound consequences for the pairing symmetry.@xcite    another reason for a recent surge of interest in noncentrosymmetric superconductors is that they appear to be promising candidates for topological superconductivity .",
    "the defining property of topological quantum matter is that the quantum states in the bulk fall into distinct classes characterized by integer - valued topological invariants , which remain unchanged under sufficiently small variations of the system s parameters.@xcite one popular example of a centrosymmetric topological superconductor or superfluid is the time reversal ( tr ) symmetry - breaking chiral @xmath4-wave state , which is realized in sr@xmath1ruo@xmath5 ( ref . ) and thin films of superfluid @xmath6he-@xmath7 ( ref . ) .",
    "superfluid @xmath6he-@xmath8 is an example of a tr - invariant topological state , which is similar to a three - dimensional ( 3d ) topological insulator.@xcite a common feature of the topological materials is that , while fermionic excitations in the bulk are gapped , there are gapless states localized near various inhomogeneities .",
    "archetypal examples include the current - carrying boundary modes in the quantum hall insulators@xcite or topological band insulators,@xcite the andreev bound states near the sample surfaces or the domain walls separating different degenerate ground states,@xcite and the majorana fermions in the vortex cores in chiral @xmath4-wave superconductors.@xcite    noncentrosymmetric superconductivity has mostly been observed in 3d materials , but it can also be realized in two dimensions ( 2d ) .",
    "always a subject of a considerable interest , both experimental and theoretical , the field of 2d superconductivity has recently received a big boost , following the discovery of superconductivity in the 2d electron gas at the interface lao / sto between two band insulators , laalo@xmath0 and srtio@xmath0 ( ref . ) .",
    "other similar systems include the interfaces lsco / lco between metallic and insulating copper oxides , or lto / sto between a mott insulator latio@xmath0 and srtio@xmath0 , and also surfaces of doped insulating oxides , such as sto and possibly wo@xmath0 , see ref . for a review and references",
    ". a particularly attractive feature of the interface superconductors is that their electronic properties , in particular , the carrier density and the so coupling strength , can be controlled by an external electric field .",
    "the superconducting critical temperature @xmath9 in these systems can be as high as 109 k , for fese single layers on doped sto substrates.@xcite the interface superconductors lack inversion symmetry , due to the different nature of the materials sandwiching the conducting layer .",
    "furthermore , since the so coupling is much larger than @xmath9 ( ref . )",
    ", the 2d electron bands are well split , suppressing any interband cooper pairing .",
    "the standard theoretical approach , which relies on the separation of singlet and triplet pairing channels in spin - degenerate bands , works for centrosymmetric superconductors , see , _ e.g. _ , ref . , but is not justified in materials with a large so splitting of nondegenerate bands . in the latter case , it is appropriate to do away with the spin representation and construct the cooper pairs from the time - reversed helicity band states .",
    "the band representation is essential for any bcs - like model of pairing built upon the conceptual foundation of the fermi - liquid theory , in which fermionic quasiparticles exist and experience an attractive interaction only in the vicinity of the fermi surface .",
    "the fermi surface itself can only be defined in the band representation , as a set of points in momentum space where a helicity band crosses the fermi level .",
    "the goal of this paper is to develop a detailed theory of the pairing symmetry and the topological properties of 2d crystalline noncentrosymmetric superconductors in the helicity band representation , which is introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : electron bands ] .",
    "in contrast to previous studies , our treatment neither uses the spin representation nor relies on any particular model of the so coupling , although the generalized rashba model is sometimes used to illustrate our results . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sc ] , starting with a modified bcs model of pairing in nondegenerate bands , we analyze all possible symmetries of the superconducting gap and derive the proper form of the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) hamiltonian for the fermionic quasiparticles . in secs .",
    "[ sec : gfs ] and [ sec : berry phases ] , we develop two different schemes of topological classification of the superconducting states , using the maurer - cartan invariants built from the green s functions and the wilson loops containing the berry potential of the bogoliubov quasiparticles , and also calculate the spectrum of the fermionic boundary modes . throughout the paper we use the units in which @xmath10 , neglecting , in particular , the difference between the quasiparticle momentum and wavevector .",
    "consider a 2d electron gas confined in the @xmath11 plane .",
    "we assume that its environment lacks `` upside - down '' symmetry under the reflection @xmath12 , and therefore the system does not have a center of inversion .",
    "the symmetry group of the normal state includes operations from the space group of the 2d crystal lattice as well as the tr operation @xmath13 .",
    "there are two contributions to the so coupling of electrons with the lattice , one originating from the inversion - symmetric part of the lattice potential , including the atomic cores , which is particularly important in compounds with heavy elements , and the other coming from the inversion - antisymmetric part of the potential , which is sensitive to the spatial arrangement of the atoms .",
    "while the former contribution merely replaces spin with pseudospin and does not lift the band degeneracy , it is the latter that plays a crucial role in noncentrosymmetric systems.@xcite    in the presence of both tr and inversion symmetries , the electron bands are twofold degenerate at each wavevector @xmath14 in the 2d bz ( due to the momentum space periodicity , the bz is topologically equivalent to a torus ) .",
    "indeed , the states @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the inversion , correspond to the same @xmath14 , are orthogonal , and have the same energy . in addition",
    ", these two states are degenerate with another pair of orthogonal states , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , which correspond to @xmath20 .",
    "starting with some @xmath14 in the irreducible part of the bz , one can construct a basis of the pseudospin bloch states at all other wavevectors in the star of @xmath14 , which transform under the symmetry operations in the same way as the pure spin states.@xcite below we use the same notation @xmath21 for the spin or pseudospin direction .",
    "the four degenerate pseudospin states corresponding to @xmath14 and @xmath20 can be used to introduce the singlet and triplet superconducting order parameters , with simple transformation properties under the point group and tr operations.@xcite    in contrast , in noncentrosymmetric crystals with the so coupling only the tr operation is available to connect the states of the same energy corresponding to @xmath14 and @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , the pseudospin degeneracy of the bands is lifted almost everywhere in the 2d bz , except some high - symmetry points .",
    "we shall see below that the band degeneracy points ( also called the weyl points ) play a crucial role in determining the bloch states topology . in the limit of zero so coupling but still without inversion symmetry , double degeneracy of the bands at all",
    "@xmath14 is preserved by arbitrary spin rotations .",
    "we do not consider this case here , because it is not applicable to real noncentrosymmetric superconductors .",
    "we will use the index @xmath22 , called the helicity , see sec .",
    "[ sec : rashba model ] below , to label the nondegenerate electron bands , which contain all information about the lattice potential and the so coupling , so that @xmath23 is the lattice - periodic part of the bloch wave function belonging to wavevector @xmath14 in the @xmath22th band .",
    "the corresponding band dispersion , @xmath24 , includes the chemical potential ( we neglect the difference between the chemical potential and the fermi energy @xmath25 ) and is even in momentum : @xmath26 this last property is a consequence of tr symmetry , because the states @xmath23 and @xmath27 belong to @xmath14 and @xmath20 , respectively , and have the same energy . recall that the tr operator for spin-1/2 particles has the form @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the pauli matrix and @xmath30 is complex conjugation .",
    "since the bands are nondegenerate almost everywhere in the bz , one can write @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a phase factor , which is not gauge invariant , in the sense that it depends on the phases of the bloch states . since @xmath33 and , on the other hand , @xmath34",
    ", we obtain : @xmath35 .",
    "the phase factors @xmath36 are not defined at @xmath37 or any other tr invariant point in the bz .",
    "a momentum - space point @xmath38 is called tr invariant if it satisfies the condition @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is a reciprocal lattice vector .",
    "the total number of the tr invariant points in the bz is always even and denoted by @xmath41 . at tr",
    "invariant momenta , the @xmath22th band is degenerate with another band , see sec .",
    "[ sec : rashba model ] below .",
    "since the cooper pairing takes place between the bloch states @xmath23 and @xmath27 , corresponding to opposite momenta near the fermi surface , and the superconducting order parameter varies little on the scale of the inverse fermi wavevector , one can neglect the lattice translations and focus on the crystallographic rotations and reflections in the vertical planes , which form the 2d point group @xmath42 .",
    "there are ten crystallographic point groups in 2d , also known as the rosette groups : five cyclic groups @xmath43 and five dihedral groups @xmath44 , with @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , or @xmath49 .",
    "the cyclic group @xmath43 has @xmath22 elements and is generated by the rotation @xmath50 about the @xmath51 axis by an angle @xmath52 .",
    "the dihedral group @xmath44 has @xmath53 elements and is generated by @xmath50 and also by a reflection @xmath54 in a vertical plane .",
    "one can associate a `` parent '' 3d point group @xmath43 or @xmath55 with each rosette group , keeping in mind that , when acting on two - component vectors @xmath56 any reflection in a vertical plane is equivalent to a rotation by @xmath57 about a horizontal axis , hence the name `` dihedral '' .",
    "for example ,",
    "the reflection @xmath58 in the @xmath59 plane has the same effect as a @xmath57-rotation about the @xmath60 axis : @xmath61 .",
    "the states @xmath23 and @xmath27 can be combined into a bispinor @xmath62 to avoid double counting , the wavevectors labelling @xmath63 are restricted to a half of the brillouin zone ( hbz ) , which should be chosen in such a way that it does not contain time - reversed momenta @xmath14 and @xmath20 at the same time . since the electron bands are nondegenerate , action by a point group element @xmath64 on @xmath23 produces a state which belongs to the wave vector @xmath65 and differs from @xmath66 only by a phase factor : @xmath67 . using the commutation of @xmath64 and @xmath13 we have @xmath68 , which leads to the following transformation properties : @xmath69 note that , since the bloch states @xmath23 are spin-@xmath70 spinors , any rotation by @xmath71 changes their sign .",
    "for instance , for the fourfold rotation @xmath72 we have @xmath73 .",
    "this double - valuedness can be dealt with in the standard fashion , @xcite by adding a fictitious new symmetry element @xmath74 to the point group , which commutes with all other elements and satisfies the conditions @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the identity element .",
    "its action on the bispinors ( [ bispinor ] ) is given by @xmath79 .",
    "the transformation rules for the electron creation and annihilation operators are obtained from eq .",
    "( [ trans - psis ] ) , if one views the bloch states as vectors in the fock space , _ i.e. _ , @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the vacuum state , which is assumed to be invariant under all symmetry operations . using eq .",
    "( [ t_n ] ) we arrive at the following expression for the creation operator in the time - reversed state : @xmath82 where @xmath83",

    "( [ trans - k - c ] ) to emphasize the antiunitarity of the tr operator .",

    "( [ c - tilde c ] ) , ( [ trans - g - c ] ) , and ( [ trans - k - c ] ) .      to illustrate the points made above we start with the general hamiltonian of noninteracting electrons in a tr invariant noncentrosymmetric crystal lattice with the so coupling:@xcite @xmath88\\hat a^\\dagger_{\\bk\\mu\\alpha}\\hat a_{\\bk\\nu\\beta},\\ ] ] where @xmath89 and @xmath90 are the electron creation and annihilation operators in the pseudospin bloch states , @xmath91 are the pauli matrices , and the wavevector summation is performed over the bz .",
    "the first term , with @xmath92 , describes the twofold degenerate bands obtained from the inversion - symmetric lattice potential , including the intra - atomic so coupling , which are labelled by the indices @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "all effects of the inversion - antisymmetric lattice potential and the corresponding so coupling are contained in the last two terms .",
    "it follows from the requirements of lattice periodicity , hermiticity , and tr invariance that @xmath95 and @xmath96 are real , odd in @xmath14 , periodic in reciprocal space , and satisfy @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "the point group imposes additional constraints , see ref . for details .",
    "the pseudospin degeneracy of the bands is lifted if the @xmath99 term is nonzero .",

    "<S> we present a detailed study of the gap symmetry and the quasiparticle wave function topology in two - dimensional superconductors without inversion center . </S>",
    "<S> the strong spin - orbit coupling of electrons with the crystal lattice makes it necessary to describe superconductivity in terms of one or more nondegenerate bands characterized by helicity . </S>",
    "<S> we develop a topological classification of the superconducting states using the integer - valued maurer - cartan invariants and the bogoliubov wilson loops , and also calculate the spectrum of fermionic boundary modes . </S>"
