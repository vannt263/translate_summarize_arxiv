    "agile inaf - iasf roma ] @xcite is a small space mission of the italian space agency ( asi ) devoted to astrophysics in the gamma - ray energy range 30  mev - 50  gev , with a monitor in the x - ray band 18  kev - 60  kev .",
    "the agile payload is composed of three instruments : a tungsten - silicon tracker ( st ) @xcite , with a large field of view , good time resolution , sensitivity and angular resolution ; a silicon based x - ray detector , superagile ( sa ) @xcite , for imaging in the range 18  kev - 60  kev and a csi(tl ) mini - calorimeter ( mcal ) @xcite for the detection of gamma - rays or charged particles in the range 300  kev - 200  mev . st and mcal form the so called gamma - ray imaging detector ( grid ) for observations in the energy range 30  mev - 50  gev .",
    "the instrument is surrounded by an anticoincidence ( ac ) system @xcite , made with plastic scintillator layers , for the rejection of charged particles and is completed by the payload data handling unit ( pdhu ) @xcite .",
    "agile was successfully launched on april 23 2007 from satish dhawan space centre ( india ) on a pslv rocket .",
    "the agile grid detection principle is based on the pair production process .",
    "the interaction of a high energy photon with a tungsten layer of the silicon tracker originates an electron positron pair whose direction of propagation is sampled by the st detection panes .",
    "st determines the direction of the incoming radiation , while mcal , operating as a slave of st , measures the energy deposited by particles reaching it .",
    "mcal can also work as a stand - alone gamma - ray detector in the range 300  kev - 100  mev , with no imaging capabilities , for the detection of transient events and gamma ray bursts ( grb ) and for evaluation of gamma - ray background fluctuations . for grbs in the superagile field of view",
    ", sa will be able to determine the position of the source and its hard x - ray spectrum , while mcal will describe the spectrum above 300  kev and its time variation in correlation with sa .",
    "the two instruments are arranged to work together at pdhu level .",
    "furthermore mcal produces a broad - band spectrum of the gamma - ray sky ( scientific ratemeters ) with a refresh rate of 1 sec , for the monitoring of gamma - ray background .",
    "the architecture of mcal has been designed to accomplish its different tasks at the same time starting from a single detector system .    in this paper a detailed description of the mcal instrument will be provided , from the design solutions adopted to the detector construction and tests .",
    "the pre - launch instrument performance will be discussed as well .",
    "mcal was conceived as a part of the grid detector , to complement the st in the detection of events , supplying the energy information of the tracked particles . for this detector",
    "its fate is also in its name : mini - calorimeter .",
    "agile is a small mission with severe constraints concerning payload dimension , weight and power consumption : the overall active payload weight is @xmath0 , with a power consumption of about @xmath1 .",
    "the spacecraft total weight is @xmath2 . within this frame ,",
    "just @xmath3 and @xmath4 were allocated for the calorimeter so that the resulting detector could just be mini .    apart from the weight and power constraints , few simple concepts had to be followed for the mcal basic design : its geometrical area should match the st cross section and it should be capable of determining energy and position of triggered events .",
    "no constraints were put on the complexity of the electronic design of the system and on the number of its functions . therefore , since it was not possible to add more scientific instruments to the mission due to payload weight constraints , it was decided to operate mcal also to detect gamma - ray transients , the so - called burst mode , and to monitor the overall low energy gamma - ray background during the orbit .    concerning the mcal contribution to grid operations",
    "it was recognised since the early simulations of the agile payload that , due to the limited mcal thickness ( only 1.5 radiation lengths , about @xmath5 ) , its efficacy as a calorimeter is restricted to the lower part of the whole grid energy range .",
    "for photon energies where mcal contribution is not conclusive , the energy of the detected photon is evaluated from the scattering angles of the particles moving through the st detection planes . in this case",
    "mcal can still contribute with a further positional information in the farest location from the gamma - ray interaction .",
    "moreover , the topological information provided by mcal ( i.e. number of hit detectors , position distribution of events ) help the events filtering procedure for background discrimination .",
    "the mcal design arises from a trade - off between the instrument weight constraint and the efficiency requirements in the detection of high energy gamma - rays .",
    "its thickness of about 3  cm gives an acceptable compromise , resulting in a good efficiency for gamma - rays of some mev .",
    "mcal energy threshold is about 300  kev , resulting as a trade - off itself between the minimum energy threshold requirement and the electronic noise performance as well as low power consumption constraints .",
    "operating as a grb monitor , the main goal of mcal is the detection of fast transients at mev energies with microsecond time resolution . in detecting grbs mcal",
    "is complemented by the sa instrument , which operates at hard x - ray energy and has imaging capabilities in a @xmath6 field of view .",
    "mcal can provide only limited information on burst direction , but it has a @xmath7 field of view , thus behaving as a true all - sky monitor , even if , for grbs out of the sa field of view , a localization from other satellites is required to proceed in spectral analysis ( since the detector s response is direction dependent ) . for grb detection a dedicated trigger logic must also be included in the system design , in order to trigger on fast rate increases above the background level .",
    "grbs at mev energies have been detected by the batse and comptel instruments on - board the compton gamma - ray observatory ( cgro ) during the 90s , and are currently observed by several instruments in space .",
    "grbs at higher energy have been detected by the egret instrument on - board cgro , and gev emission has been predicted by some models @xcite and reported for some bursts @xcite .",
    "there are also many attempts to detect grb at tev energy @xcite , the most stringent upper limits being currently provided by the magic telescope @xcite .",
    "high energy gamma - ray bursts are rare events , which have not been studied in details up to now .",
    "for the first time we can study these events with an unprecedented time resolution , better than @xmath8 , over an energy range spanning six orders of magnitude with all the three main agile detectors combined together .",
    "this search has recently led to the agile detection above 50  mev of the first grb after the egret era @xcite .",
    "extensive simulations were done to verify the scientific performance of the instrument and to optimize its design @xcite .",
    "a detailed representation of mcal is included in the monte carlo code used for scientific simulations .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]",
    "the mini - calorimeter of the agile mission is a versatile and powerful gamma - ray detector for the energy range 0.3 - 100  mev based on segmented scintillator detectors with solid state readout .",
    "the inclusion of two parallel , simultaneously active acquisition branches allowed the full exploitation of the detectors capabilities , despite the strict constraint frame in which it has been developed .",
    "mcal had to undergo several calibration and qualification steps before and after integration in the agile payload .",
    "the performance obtained on ground satisfy the scientific requirements .",
    "agile was launched on april 23 2007 and is currently fully operative . after more than one year of in - orbit operations mcal is fully functional and scientific exploitation of the mcal data is ongoing .",
    "agile is a mission of the italian space agency , with co - participation of inaf ( istituto nazionale di astrofisica ) and infn ( istituto nazionale di fisica nucleare ) .",
    "the authors wish to thank all the agile team for their help and fruitful discussions .",
    "the authors wish to thank also the industrial partners , namely the agile people at thales - alenia space italia and carlo gavazzi space , for their fundamental contribution to the construction , integration and testing of mcal .",
    "many thanks also to dr .",
    "elio rossi , alessandro mauri and alessandro traci for their skillful electronics and mechanical prototyping and testing .",
    "in this section the analytical algorithm used for energy and position reconstruction in an agile mcal bar is described . throughout this section a perfect exponential behavior in the light output of a bar",
    "is assumed , as described in subsection [ detection_plane ] .",
    "where : + @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the offsets of pd - a and pd - b electronic chains respectively , expressed in adc channels ; + @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the gain of pd - a and pd - b electronic chains respectively , expressed in adc channels / mev ; + @xmath22 and @xmath23 are side a and b light attenuation coefficients respectively , expressed in @xmath24 .",
