    "@xmath12 and wilson coefficients @xmath13 , renormalized at the scale @xmath14 .",
    "the task is then to evaluate the wilson coefficients and the matrix elements of the operators between the initial and final hadronic states , in the case at hand , between @xmath11 and @xmath15 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath13 can be calculated perturbatively . a comprehensive review of the current status of the hamiltonian ( [ heff ] )",
    "can be found in @xcite . in order to obtain the exclusive matrix elements @xmath16 , some hadronic model or nonperturbative method must be invoked .    in leading logarithmic approximation ,",
    "only the matrix element of the dominant @xmath17 operator is needed .",
    "it has been calculated using various methods @xcite .",
    "however , there remains a rather strong @xmath14 dependence .",
    "it can be reduced by next - to - leading order calculations of the @xmath13 and a corresponding higher order in @xmath18 determination of the matrix elements .",
    "for example , in the case of the inclusive reaction @xmath19 one has to calculate the two - loop - diagrams involving the operator @xmath20 . here ,",
    "the next - to - leading analysis has essentially been completed @xcite .",
    "generally , it is assumed that a similar approach is adequate for exclusive transitions .",
    "the corresponding diagrams are shown in fig . 1 .",
    "when considering the penguin - like loops in these diagrams , a perturbative calculation seems adequate for gluon virtualities @xmath21 and even when @xmath22 .",
    "furthermore , if the photon is emitted from the @xmath23 or @xmath24 quark or from the spectator quark ( figs .",
    "1b , d ) , the integration over the @xmath25-quark loop produces a factor @xmath26 which cancels the denominator of the gluon propagator , effectively suppressing low - virtuality gluons . however , when the @xmath25quark loop converts into a photon ( fig .",
    "1a , c ) , the gluon may have a characteristic virtuality @xmath27 .",
    "this case is beyond perturbation theory .",
    "the role of these long - distance penguins in @xmath28 illustrated graphically in fig .",
    "2 will be the main concern of this paper .",
    "their effect has been considered by many authors on a phenomenological level .",
    "the possibility extensively discussed in the literature @xcite is to model the transition @xmath29 , @xmath30 being a light meson , by a sum over the nonleptonic decays @xmath31 followed by the transition @xmath32 where @xmath33 is an appropriate virtual vector state such as the @xmath34 .",
    "since at zero momentum squared @xmath35 of the photon , the characteristic distance to the physical threshold @xmath36 is rather large , not only the ground state @xmath34 but also excited @xmath1 states must be included .",
    "unfortunately , the transverse parts of these amplitudes are poorly known and the extrapolation from @xmath36 to @xmath37 is not straightforward .",
    "therefore , for a real photon , the vector - resonance description of the virtual @xmath38 loop seems uncertain , calling for a more reliable or at least different estimate .    as a new approach to the problem",
    ", we suggest to use operator product expansion ( ope ) and qcd sum rules @xcite .",
    "several important circumstances make these methods exceptionally suitable .",
    "firstly , the fact that the @xmath38 loop is far off  shell , which is a disadvantage for @xmath1 insertion , turns out to be a major advantage here .",
    "it means that we must keep only a few terms in the ope .",
    "secondly , the qcd sum rule method provides a physically very intuitive parametrization of the interaction of the @xmath38 loop with soft gluons in terms of vacuum condensates .",
    "thirdly , and most importantly , we will be able to compare the long - distance effect in @xmath0 with the contribution of the dominant magnetic penguin operator obtained in one and the same calculational framework .",
    "of course , as with any low energy effective method , there are some unavoidable theoretical uncertainties",
    ". one of them is the question of double counting in the perturbative and nonperturbative contributions . as usual , we assume that the former are small in the region where the latter dominate , that is at @xmath39",
    ".    there are other nonperturbative effects , such as those illustrated in fig .",
    "3 , which involve radiative matrix elements of the four - fermion operators @xmath40 .",
    "these contribute already at tree level and have been estimated @xcite using qcd sum rules on the light - cone .",
    "they are unimportant for the @xmath41 transitions due to ckm suppression ( fig .",
    "3a ) , and also relatively small for @xmath42 transitions ( fig .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "2 , we consider the contribution of the operator @xmath20 to the exclusive @xmath28 amplitude and single out the term responsible for soft gluon emission from the @xmath25-quark loop . with the help of ope , this term is expressed by a composite operator involving quark , gluon and photon fields . in sect .",
    "3 , we derive a qcd sum rule for the @xmath43 matrix element , including the new operator",
    ". the most important nonperturbative contributions of gluon , quark - gluon , and quark condensates up to dimension 6 to the relevant correlation function are calculated in sect .",
    "our numerical results are presented in sect . 5 and our conclusions in sect .",
    "in the framework of the effective hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) the exclusive @xmath43 decay amplitude is given by @xmath44 = v_cbv_cs^*k^*(q)b(p+q )  , [ ampl ] where the four - momenta of the @xmath11 and @xmath15 meson , and the photon are denoted by @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 , respectively , while @xmath48 is the photon polarization four - vector .",

    "note that throughout the paper we put @xmath53 .",
    "the other operators generate radiative decays when combined with the electromagnetic interaction of quarks with the photon . in this paper , we restrict ourselves to the four - quark operators o_1= ( |c_l_c_l)(|s_l^b_l )  , [ o2 ] o_2= ( |s_l_c_l)(|c_l^b_l )  , [ o1 ] relying on the fact that the other operators have much smaller short - distance coefficients . to our knowledge ,",
    "an analysis of long - distance effects in @xmath0 generated by @xmath54 and @xmath55 has never been done and is certainly desirable .",
    "perturbative contributions of @xmath55 have been estimated in the relativistic quark model @xcite and found to be small .    for @xmath56 ,",
    "the relevant diagrams contributing to the amplitude ( [ ampl ] ) are shown in fig .",
    "the analogous graphs for the operator @xmath57 vanish for a real photon .",
    "after fierz transformation , the operator @xmath20 reads : o_2= 3 o_1 + 12_1  , [ o11 ] + = ( |c_2 c ) ( |s^2 b )  , [ otilde ] where @xmath58 .",
    "it is only the operator @xmath59 which plays a role .",
    "the effective colour transfer in the weak vertex is compensated by a gluon exchange between the @xmath25quark loop and other quarks in the process .",
    "the photon emission from the @xmath25quark loop is therefore a purely nonfactorizable effect .    keeping in ( [ ampl ] ) only the operators @xmath17 and @xmath59 and retaining in @xmath60 only the @xmath25quark part , the decay amplitude simplifies to @xmath61 + i2^ d^4x  e^ipx t\\{|c(x)_c(x)_1(0 ) } ] b(p+q ) .",

    ", we expect that the ope for the @xmath25quark loop in terms of local operators is adequate .",
    "the first term of this expansion is simply a gluon field operator .",
    "the corresponding wilson coefficient is represented by the diagrams of fig .",

    "4 only the axial part of @xmath67 contributes , whereas the contribution of the vector part vanishes due to furry s theorem .",
    "the higher dimension operators in the expansion ( [ charm ] ) denoted by the ellipses contain derivatives of the gluon field and/or additional gluon field operators .",
    "they are neglected here . substituting the expansion ( [ charm ] ) into ( [ ampl1 ] ) , and putting @xmath68 yields a(b k^ * ) = 4()v_cbv_cs^ * k^*(q ) b(p+q ) [ ampl2 ] where o_f=-|s_2g_^a d^f^b [ eff ] is a new effective operator describing the soft gluon interaction sketched in fig .",
    "2 .    before turning to the estimate of the matrix element of @xmath69 , a comment on the accuracy of approximation ( [ charm ] )",
    "is in order .",
    "a similar approximation was used in @xcite in estimating the nonfactorizable contributions to @xmath70 ( see also @xcite ) . in this analysis ,",
    "the criteria for the applicability of ope are discussed in detail .",
    "following the same line of arguments , we notice that the next - to - leading operator in ( [ charm ] ) will contain a derivative of the gluon field @xmath71 multiplied by the photon momentum @xmath72 and an extra factor of order of @xmath73 .",
