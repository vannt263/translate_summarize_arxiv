    "artificial atoms inevitably suffer from short coherence times owing to their coupling to dissipative environment @xcite , making it difficult to envision long - lived entangled states with such kind of qubits for practical applications . to date , a conclusive demonstration of long - lived entangled states in spatially separated and distant qds has not been shown .    to this end",

    "the main goal would be to achieve a long - range coherent energy transfer between the qds by overcoming their short - distance interactions , such as tunneling and frster coupling , thus enabling individual qubit manipulation . among the different nanophotonic systems ,",
    "photonic crystals represent one of the most promising platforms to achieve such long - range interactions between spatially separated qds @xcite .",

    "based on these grounds , it has been recently proposed that sizable radiative coupling can be achieved between qds embedded in photonic crystal dimers ( pcd ) @xcite , i.e. , coupled photonic crystal cavities , where the qds distance can be considerably larger than their resonant wavelength .",
    "such a system could be useful to finally obtain a long - distance entanglement , an alternative to recent proposals based on plasmonic @xcite or nanowire photonic crystal @xcite approaches . moreover , the pcd approach might be promising to realize a recently proposed scheme allowing us to obtain steady - state entanglement via quantum bath engineering @xcite , thus overcoming the known issues of qds in terms of short coherence times .    in this work",

    "we consider qd 2 initially out of resonance , and qd 1 in resonance with the normal mode at frequency @xmath26 , and we assume an initial condition with a single exciton in qd 1 at @xmath120 , i.e. , @xmath116 .",
    "then , we wait for a time @xmath126 at which the excitation has been almost completely transferred to normal mode 1 due to rabi coupling . at this time , qd 2 is brought into resonance with qd 1 , which can be accomplished by using the quantum confined stark effect @xcite , for example .",
    "all these steps are performed by pumping the qds at the frequency of the dark state of the system .",

    "here we have assumed the same qd loss rates as in the calculations of the previous section , and the intercavity distances considered here delimit the flat region in fig .",
    "[ fig : neg - vs - d](a ) . from fig .",
    "[ fig : neg - vs - t](a ) , it is evident that our approach is totally equivalent to consider an initial excitation in the photonic mode , and the amount of entanglement is also very close to the maximum value obtained in the transient dynamics for @xmath71 . as in fig .",
    "[ fig : neg - vs - t - dc1 ] , the amplitude of the oscillations decreases with increasing time due to dissipation in the resonant normal mode of the pcd .",
    "when qd losses are taken into account , maximum negativity values around @xmath127 , i.e. , @xmath128 of the maximal value , are obtained for state - of - art qds .",
    "however , the presence of this dissipation channel produces a faster decreasing amplitude as compared to the corresponding result for @xmath71 . as a consequence",
    ", the steady - state value is achieved more rapidly .",
    "for interdot distance @xmath94 nm , i.e. , the results shown in fig .  [ fig : neg - vs - t](b ) , the presence of the second normal mode , with the same symmetry of the excitonic dark state , starts to play a role in the transient dynamics , providing an additional loss channel for the entangled qds ; even for @xmath71 , the steady - state regime is rapidly achieved .",
    "nevertheless , maximum negativity values of about @xmath127 , or @xmath128 of the maximal value , are obtained for state - of - art qds . in the early dynamics , as shown in insets of fig .",
    "[ fig : neg - vs - t ] , the fast oscillation frequency is determined by the qd - pcd mode coupling rates , @xmath28 , and the negativity amplitude is affected by the loss rates : since the normal mode losses , @xmath33 , are smaller for the @xmath94  nm than for the @xmath124  nm intercavity distance , the negativity amplitude is larger for @xmath94  nm than for @xmath124  nm .",
    "however , the slow transient dynamics ( i.e. , after 200  ps ) determines large negativity time intervals that are much larger than the photonic mode and qd lifetimes , which could be relevant for practical applications of transient qds entanglement .",
    "we have studied the conditions for achieving steady - state entanglement between radiatively - coupled quantum dots by exploiting their mutual long - distance interaction through the normal modes of a photonic crystal dimer .",
    "the amount of entanglement is quantified through the peres - horodecki negativity criterion of the reduced density matrix within the two qd subspace , which is computed through the quantum - dissipative master equation in the markov approximation .",
    "the photonic crystal slab structures were solved within the guided mode expansion approach , and their solutions were used as input parameters for the master equation formalism .",
    "material parameters relevant to ingaas and gaas nanostructures were considered throughout the work , but the results can be generalized to an arbitrary material platform .    in the steady - state regime and for resonant pumping condition , we have found that the largest entanglement is obtained at the excitonic dark state of the system , i.e. , for a coherent driving of the quantum dots with a phase difference of ( a ) @xmath76 when coupled to a symmetric normal mode of the photonic crystal dimer , and ( b ) @xmath77 when they are coupled to an antisymmetric one , respectively , @xmath23 being an integer . the largest negativity value achieved in this regime",
    "is predicted to be on the order of @xmath129 , i.e. , @xmath0 of the maximum value , and it remains of the same order of magnitude as long as the normal mode splitting is well - defined , i.e. , larger than the photonic mode linewidths .",
    "these results are shown to be robust against the main sources of qd decoherence , such as spontaneous emission and pure dephasing .",
    "furthermore , when the splitting is of the order of the photonic mode linewidths , the negativity is roughly proportional to the normal mode splitting . on the other hand , when a qds inhomogeneous distribution is considered , the entanglement is shown to remain sizable only for detunings that are smaller than their linewidths . as a consequence ,",
    "the qd radiative coupling is a necessary but not a sufficient condition to obtain entanglement between the two qubits . in terms of the photonic crystal dimer ,",
    "our results show that the @xmath11 dimer is the most convenient configuration to show long - range entanglement , due to its very - well - defined normal mode splitting even at intercavity distances that are larger than the characteristic operational wavelength of the system .",
    "when addressing the transient dynamics of the system , it has been shown that the degree of entanglement can be sizably larger than the steady - state value .",
    "in such a case , we found that an optimal condition for initializing the system is obtained when considering an initial excitation in the resonant normal mode , where long - time negativity oscillations with a frequency @xmath119 are seen with a period much larger than both photon and exciton lifetimes , respectively .",
    "based on these results , we have proposed and demonstrated an effective protocol for generating the same long - time entanglement oscillations in practical devices , by initializing the system with a single excitation in one of the quantum dots ( which represents an operationally less challenging task ) .",
    "negativity values of the order of @xmath130 , i.e. , @xmath128 of the maximum value , were obtained for state - of - art ingaas quantum dots in our proposed device . as a final remark",
