    "over the past 25 years , the hubble space telescope ( hst ) has assembled a phenomenal legacy of extragalactic surveys .",
    "several legacy fields have been imaged at a variety of wavelengths , becoming the focus of ground based telescopes and communities interested in intermediate and high redshift science @xcite .",
    "additionally , pure - parallel fields surveys have covered large uncorrelated areas providing even larger samples and means to control sample variance @xcite .",
    "a perhaps less well - known part of the hst legacy are spectroscopic surveys carried out initially with the near infrared camera and multi - object spectrograph ( nicmos * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the advanced camera for suverys ( acs * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and more recently with the wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . by virtue of its low background and exquisite image quality",
    "compared to the ground , hst excels in low resolution slitless spatially resolved spectroscopy , particularly in the near infrared .",
    "thus , it has become a workhorse for galaxy evolution studies , including : the study of spatially resolved star formation @xcite ; the detection of rare galaxies with strong emission lines and faint continuum emission @xcite ; and the measurement of absorption line redshifts for @xmath3 galaxies @xcite    current hst spectroscopic surveys have focused on relatively shallow spectroscopy of extragalactic fields .",
    "although this is a very productive way to survey large areas of the sky , the target depth has typically been insufficient to address some of the most interesting questions in galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "for example , hst spectroscopic surveys have been able to detect ly@xmath4  for the brightest galaxies usually only during the tail - end of cosmic reionization @xcite . additionally , at lower redshifts",
    ", legacy fields and random parallels do not contain massive clusters of galaxies and thus can not probe the densest environments .",
    "the fields of massive clusters of galaxies provide a very powerful complement to the traditional legacy fields . on the one hand",
    "they contain massive clusters of galaxies and thus enable the study of environmental effects . on the other hand",
    "the clusters themselves act as gravitational telescopes by magnifying objects in the background through the gravitational lensing effect .",
    "the lensing magnification enables the study of intrinsically fainter and more compact galaxies in the background than would be possible in empty fields , at the expense of increased contamination by the foreground and a loss of cosmic volume for a fixed solid angle .",
    "it is important to stress that the net effect of a gravitational telescope on the number counts of a background population ( sometimes known as magnification bias ) can be both positive or negative , depending on the slope of the luminosity function : if the differential luminosity function is steeper than @xmath5 , one detects more objects behind a gravitational telescope , if it shallower the empty field has a higher yield ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in practice ",
    "at the bright end of the luminosity function where counts are rising exponentially  the net gain from lensing is huge and aids greatly in the detection of galaxies at @xmath6 . even more importantly , for a fixed exposure time , lensing allows one to probe an intrinsically fainter population , thus providing qualitatively different insights into the source population .",
    "exploiting lensing magnification @xcite is one of the motivations behind many hst cluster surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the grism lens amplified survey from space ( glass ; pi treu ; go 13459 ) has been designed and carried out in order to address some of the most compelling scientific questions by combining the power of deep hst spectroscopy with the magnification effect of gravitational lensing . the key science questions to be addressed by glass are    1 .",

    "( 2015 , in prep ) .",
    "in addition to the key questions driving the survey design , the data collected by glass enable the study of luminous and dark matter in the cluster themselves , by providing spectroscopic redshifts of background sources to improve the lensing models , and provide additional epochs to search for high redshift supernovae gravitational lensed by the clusters .",

    "however , how and when exactly it gets there is the topic of much debate .",
    "the interaction between the first galaxies and the intergalactic medium ( igm ) is poorly understood , leaving many questions unanswered .",
    "how many ionizing photons escape from the local interstellar medium ( ism ) into the igm ?",
    "what is the topology of the ism / igm at these redshifts ?",
    "what is the relative contribution of galaxies vs active nuclei to ionizing budget @xcite ?",

    "quantitative constraints inferred from lya emitting galaxies still suffer significantly from observational uncertainties ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , uncertainties exist on the theoretical side which include how ly@xmath4  photons escape from galaxies , how this depends on galaxy properties , the role of galactic winds , and how much lya is reprocessed by the cgm ( giving rise to  blobs / halos  see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "recent ground - based observations suggest dramatic and rapid evolution of the igm / ism beyond @xmath10 .",
    "an important clue is that the fraction of dropouts that are ly@xmath4  emitters , increases steadily out to @xmath15 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while it declines significantly at @xmath11 and above @xcite .",
    "large samples are now available at redshifts up to 7 where high - sensitivity multiplexed optical spectrographs can be used , and suggest that the igm might indeed be partially neutral with a patchy distribution of ly@xmath4  optical depth ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter p14 ) .",
    "in contrast , spectroscopic follow - up at @xmath16 has been very difficult , owing to the atmosphere which limits studies to a few specific redshift windows , inspite of the recent introduction of high sensitivity high multiplexed near infrared spectrographs ( e.g. , mosfire * ? ? ?",
    "this difficulty is compounded by the weak average ly@xmath4  emission for the brighter continuum sources typically accessible with spectroscopy in legacy fields compared to the fainter ones @xcite .",
    "the goal of glass is to target a large sample of intrinsically faint lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) at @xmath17 in order to make the most accurate measurement to date of the distribution of the ly@xmath4  optical depth , and thus probe the properties of the igm / ism .",
    "the first result of this investigation are discussed in detail by @xcite . to achieve this goal glass exploits lensing magnification by the foreground clusters to reach fainter luminosities than would be possible in blank fields and thus in principle larger number of detections .",
    "furthermore , theoretical @xcite and observational @xcite arguments indicate that high-@xmath18 ly@xmath4emitters might be significantly more spatially extended than the associated uv continuum .",
    "glass should provide the first constraints on the spatial extent of the ly@xmath4  emission on subarcsecond scales , via an individual study of magnified bright sources and a stacking analysis of the sample @xcite    lines with flux above 3-@xmath19 as a function of total g102 orbits divided over n@xmath20 clusters .",
    "once a sufficent depth is reached , the number of detection increases linearly with the number of clusters and less rapidly with exposure time owing to the loss of efficiency in magnification bias in addition to the normal scaling of noise and number counts observed in empty fields .",
    "the predictions are based on the model shown in figure  [ fig : strategy1 ] and described in the main text .",
    "only the results for cluster rxj1347 are shown for clarity . at @xmath11 and @xmath21",

    "[ fig : strategy1 ] shows the predicted number of dropouts as a function of ly@xmath4  flux .",
    "the forecast is based on three main ingredients : i ) the luminosity function of lbgs ; ii ) the conditional probability of the ly@xmath4  equivalent width for lbgs of a given continuum magnitude ; iii ) the distribution of magnifications provided by the foreground lensing clusters .",
    "for the first ingredient we use the model of the lbg lf recently proposed by @xcite building on earlier work by @xcite and @xcite .",

    "for the second ingredient we use the parametrization of the distribution of ly@xmath4  equivalent width introduced by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter t12 ) . based on data from the literature @xcite at @xmath10 the intrinsic rest - frame distribution is : @xmath24 with w@xmath25=47 , a=0.38 for sources with @xmath26 and w@xmath25=47 , a=0.89 for sources with @xmath27 .",
    "a is the fraction of emitters , @xmath28 is the delta function , and @xmath29 is the step function . as an illustration and to avoid overcluttering the figure , we consider here the `` patchy '' family of models introduce by t12 , which appears to provide the best description of the data at @xmath11 . for this family of models , the intrinsic distribution of equivalenth widths",
    "is expressed in terms of @xmath30 and the parameter @xmath31 : @xmath32 as an illustration of observational uncertainties we consider two values of @xmath33 , taken from t12 and p14 , respectively . at @xmath12 ,",
    "only upper limits are available @xcite . for simplicity",
    "we assume no evolution between @xmath11 and @xmath12 , even though the number counts might be significantly lower at @xmath12 . in any case , the numbers are sufficiently large that a smaller number of detections at @xmath12 would pose a stringent limit on the ly@xmath4  optical depth . for the third ingredient we use magnification maps based on grid - based weak and strong lensing models constructed by members of our team ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and hoag et al . 2015 , in preparation ) , using the code developed by , in the adaptive version @xcite .",
    "those are available for 7/10 clusters at the moment of this writing , including both hff and non - hff clusters .",
    "these 7 clusters are representative of the full glass sample and therefore the range of magnification maps gives a good sense of range of expected variations from cluster to cluster .",
    "mock catalogs of high - redshift galaxies are ray traced through the magnification maps to generate suitable mock catalogs in the image plane taking into account the boost in flux as well as the change in solid angle .",
    "the ly@xmath4  emission is assumed to be unresolved for this excercise , consistent with the observations @xcite .",
    "the figure shows that magnification bias is positive in all cases , and cluster fields always yield more sources than blank fields , in the range of fluxes and redshifts considered here .",
    "furthermore , there are cluster to cluster variations , but they are not extreme .",
    "this is due to the fact that the magnification effect of the most extreme lensing clusters , such as those in the hff sample , is somewhat mitigated by the size of the field of view of wfc3 .",
    "when the critical lines are larger than the wfc3 field of view , the high magnification areas can be lost to a single pointing campaign .",
    "as one can see from the range in the predictions , cluster to cluster variations are comparable to current uncertainties on the distribution of equivalent width of ly@xmath4 .",
    "how gas flows in and out of galaxies is a central question in galaxy formation and evolution as emphasized for example by the most recent decadal survey @xcite .",
    "the glass survey is particularly well suited for addressing gas flows at redshifts @xmath34 , corresponding to the peak period of cosmic star formation rate density and hence rapid gas inflow and outflow rates ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we have identified a series of specific questions that can be addressed by glass in order to better understand the role of gas flows .",
    "how do metallicity gradients evolve with cosmic time ?",
    "metallicity gradients are sensitive to the history of baryonic assembly : gas accretion , mergers , star formation , and outflows .",
    "gradients measured from spatially resolved emission line diagnostics have provided significant insight into the assembly process at @xmath35 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "cosmological simulations coupled with chemical evolution models can reproduce these data , but various models predict different behavior at earlier times ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "measurements for a large sample of galaxies over a range of redshift thus provide important constraints on galaxy assembly history ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "how does the mass - metallicity - sfr relation evolve at low stellar mass ?",
    "local galaxies lie on a tight relation where metallicity increases with stellar mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and typically decreases with sfr ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "both effects can be explained by the cycling of gas and metals between galaxies and the igm and are more pronounced at low mass .",
    "the cosmic evolution of this relation at low stellar mass is thus a powerful test of theories of feedback and of metal enrichment of the igm ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    what causes the offset of star forming galaxies in the bpt diagram @xcite at high redshifts ?",
    "star forming galaxies and agn at @xmath35 lie on separate well - defined loci in diagnostic line - ratio diagrams .",
    "high redshift galaxies are often offset from the local star forming locus toward that of agn @xcite .",
    "spatially resolved data have shown that in some galaxies this is due to a combination of star formation and a weak active galactic nucleus @xcite , while others show pure star formation with offsets seen in individual giant star forming regions @xcite .",
    "alternatively , recent work has shown that n - based indicators could be biased tracers of oxygen @xcite . distinguishing these options is critical for metallicity studies .",
    "progress in measuring resolved emission line diagnostics at high redshift has been slow due to limitations in angular resolution and sensitivity . the most promising efforts , targeting gravitationally lensed galaxies with adaptive optics ( ao ) , have yielded only a few metallicity gradients to date @xcite . seeing - limited data",
    "have been obtained for larger samples @xcite , and they are in tension with ao - based results , highlighting the need for high spatial resolution .",
    "the sensitivity of field hst surveys ( e.g. wisp , 3d - hst , pears ) is usually sufficient to study only the very brightest systems and their angular resolution does not benefit from lensing magnification .",
    "the mass - metallicity - sfr relation has been measured by numerous groups in large samples extending to @xmath36 for the most massive ( @xmath37 m@xmath38 ) and luminous sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "below @xmath39 , faint sources can be probed with optical spectra @xcite . at higher redshifts ,",
    "lensed galaxy surveys have extended this work to lower @xmath40 and sfr @xcite , but are limited by small samples ( i.e. , only @xmath41 high redshift galaxies with @xmath42 m@xmath38 ) .",
    "the vast majority of these studies rely on integrated spectra and therefore can not distinguish the cause of offsets in the bpt diagram .",
    "glass addresses these issues by collecting an unprecedented sample of emission line galaxies at @xmath43 , with spatially resolved information for a significant fraction .",
    "the questions raised above are addressed via the integrated flux and spatial distribution of multiple emission line diagnostics which are sensitive to the gas metallicity and ionizing source .",
    "in particular the strong lines [ ] , [ ] , and h@xmath44 are all observed for galaxies at @xmath45 providing good diagnostics of both metallicity and nuclear activity ( for example via the  blue  diagnostic diagram ; * ? ? ?",
    "[ ] and h@xmath4 + [ ] are also valuable diagnostics available at @xmath46 , while metallicities can still be estimated for the strongest line emitters at @xmath47 via [ ] and [ ] .",
    "as shown by @xcite , the quality of the glass data enables accurate measurements of metallicity gradients , and of the mass - metallicity - sfr relation down to m@xmath48=@xmath49 m@xmath50 at @xmath51 .",
    "this progress is made possible by the observing strategy and lensing magnification which deliver an order of magnitude improvement in flux sensitivity and of 3 - 4 in spatial resolution over previous hst grism surveys in blank fields ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in general , the broad wavelength coverage of glass enables the comparison of metallicity estimates based on different features , so that one can test , for example , whether the [ ] based estimates are biased with respect to [ ] .",
    "the epoch @xmath52 is one of rapid decline in the global star formation rate @xcite , but clusters experience an evolution in star formation activity over this time that is even stronger than the general field . identifying the processes that trigger and terminate star formation in cluster galaxies @xcite , and contrasting them to those operating in the field @xcite is key to understanding the causes of the general decline . for what galaxy types and masses are environmental effects driving the quenching of star formation , and what is instead",
    "internally driven @xcite ?",
    "is there one process that dominates over all environments or do some play a larger role in driving galaxy evolution in the field than they do in dense environments ?",
    "massive clusters are the sites where the effects of environmental processes , such as ram pressure stripping , are expected to be strongest .",
    "hence , studies of massive clusters are needed to answer these questions .",
    "each of the processes that have been proposed to quench star formation in galaxies should leave a different signature on the spatial distribution of the star formation activity within the galaxy . as an example , the loss of the galaxy hot gas halo would lead to a suppression of star formation over the whole disk , while ram - pressure stripping should leave a recognizable pattern of star formation with truncated h@xmath4  disks smaller than the undisturbed stellar disk ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for an example of ram pressure stripping ) .",
    "what is needed is thus an unbiased census of the star formation activity in a statistically significant sample of clusters , yielding both the total star formation rates and the spatial distribution of star - forming regions within galaxies .",
    "a most interesting epoch for such a study is in the range @xmath53 , where most of the evolution takes place .",
    "h@xmath4  is considered the best optical indicator of the current star formation rate , being much less affected by dust extinction and metallicity effects than [ ] @xcite .",
    "for this reason , a number of h@xmath4  surveys up to @xmath39 have been undertaken in the field using narrow - band imaging ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and with wfc3 grism observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in clusters ,",
    "narrow - band h@xmath4  studies are available for just a few systems at @xmath54 @xcite and a few other higher-@xmath18 overdense regions @xcite .",
    "these studies provide integrated h@xmath4  fluxes , and no spatial distribution information .",
    "the power of spatially resolved information is exemplified by a study of virgo which suggested that in the local universe stripping of gas is the main mechanism for quenching star formation rates in clusters @xcite .",
    "glass is designed to measure h@xmath4  fluxes for all cluster star - forming galaxies in the central 0.6 - 0.9 mpc of 10 clusters at @xmath55 .",
    "note that h@xmath4  and [ ] are blended at the resolution of g102 ; this effect can be taken into account when comparing with other samples , or corrected based on higher spectral resolution data @xcite .",
    "glass s target sensitivity is an order of magnitude improvement over previous studies of emission lines in cluster galaxies @xcite .",
    "glass is designed to reach sfr limits comparable to the deepest narrow band studies , but for all objects and with spatially resolved information ( see vulcani et al .",
    "2015 , in preparation , for more details ) .",
    "thus , glass is the first unbiased source of spatially resolved star formation within cluster galaxies at these redshifts .",
    "the combination of glass spectroscopy and hst photometry from clash / hff is used to identify uniquely the line as h@xmath4 , as well as measure morphology , spatially resolved colors and stellar masses for virtually all objects detected in emission .",
    "parallel acs g800l grism spectroscopy in two offset fields ( at 2 - 3 mpc , i.e. 1 - 3 virial radii ; 2 position angles ; see figure  [ fig : layout ] ) for each cluster , will cover the cluster infall regions , a key region for some environmental processes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in these regions h@xmath44 ( and [ ] at @xmath56 ) cab be used as star formation indicators , while [ ] further aids in redshift identification . by combining cluster cores , infall regions , and field",
    ", glass enables the study of the spatially resolved star formation across a wide range of environments .",
    "given the low number density of cluster members at such clustercentric distances , the acs grism is the ideal method to build complete samples of star - forming galaxies .",
    "the parallel acs data are not part of this first data release and will be discussed in detail in future publications .",
    "glass spectroscopy and imaging is suitable for a wide range of applications .",
    "although the survey design is driven by the three science cases described above , two additional science drivers were taken into account when possible .",
    "they are briefly summarized below .",
    "measuring the distribution of matter in clusters of galaxies is a powerful way to address a number of fundamental astrophysical questions , ranging from cosmology to the interaction between supermassive black holes and their environment .",
    "what is the self - interaction cross section of dark matter ? is dark matter cold ?",
    "what is the net effect of energy feedback from black hole accretion on dark matter halos ?    by modeling the gravitational lensing distortion of background galaxies one can obtain precise and accurate two - dimensional maps of the mass distribution in the clusters themselves .",
    "considerable effort has gone and is going into developing modeling techniques that exploit all the available information , and deep hst imaging data have allowed researchers to identify more than one hundred multiple images of background sources per clusters .",
    "however the vast majority of these multiple images do not have spectroscopic redshift identification , and photometric redshift must be used to transform their positions into constraints on the gravitational potential of the clusters .",
    "spectroscopic redshifts help enourmously by reducing the effective uncertainty of each potential measurement to below 1% and by eliminating mis - identifications and catastrophic errors on photo - z which are common for extremely faint galaxies with unusual shapes .",
    "one of the ancillary drivers of glass is to measure spectroscopic redshifts for as many faint sources as possible in order to provide more extended and cleaner catalogs of multiple images to be used as input to lens models .",
    "first examples of this application of glass are given by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "gravitational telescopes magnify all sources in the background , including transient ones . thus , in principle gravitational telescopes can be used to detect and take spectra of supernovae that are fainter and more distant than otherwise possible @xcite , thus extending the look back time over which supernovae and supernova cosmology can be studied ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if the lensed supernovae are of type ia , knowledge of their absolute magnitude provides an opportunity to break the mass - sheet degeneracy @xcite ( rodney et al .",
    "2015 ) .    in rare circumstances ,",
    "if the supernovae happens to explode within the cluster s caustics , the supernovae can appear multiply imaged to the observer .",
    "the difference in arrival time between the images is measurable and can be used as a cosmic ruler to measure distances and hence cosmology @xcite , provided the gravitational potential of the cluster can be sufficiently well constrained .",
    "this technique has been demonstrated to be very powerful using quasars as the variable lensed source .",
    "typically , the deflectors are galaxies , for which the gravitational potential can be sufficiently well constrained by extended gravitational arcs and stellar kinematics @xcite .",
    "multiply imaged supernovae are significantly more difficult to find , and the first example has been discovered only recently in data taken by the glass survey @xcite .    this area of science has been done in close coordination with the frontiersn program ( gos 13386 and go 13790 ; pi : rodney ) for the hff clusters , ensuring uniform acquisition and analysis of the data .",
    "the number and choice of clusters depend on a number of factors , starting from the steepness of the number counts of the target population .",
    "the epoch of reionization science driver was used to select the optimal strategy . figure  [ fig : strategy2 ] shows the expected number of ly@xmath4  emitters as a function of _ total _ number of orbits , using the model described in section  [ sssec : model ] , plus",
    "the actual sensitivity measured for the glass grism data  varies very rapidly between @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "we are taking as a reference the value at @xmath59 , although most objects will be detected above @xmath6 where the sensitivity is highest . ] . at @xmath60 ,",
    "once a sufficient depth per cluster is reached , the number of sources is maximized by observing more clusters rather than going deeper . observing multiple clusters also minimizes cosmic variance ( for @xmath6 galaxies @xmath61% for 10 clusters , compared to 30% for a single wfc3 field * ? ? ?",
    "observing only 4 clusters ( e.g. the initial hff targets ) for a longer individual exposure reduces the number of detections because magnification becomes less effective .",
    "of course , even though we chose the number of sources as metric , this is not the only reasonable choice . by going deeper on a smaller number of clusters one",
    "would have probed an intrinisically different population of galaxies .    in order to find the 10 best clusters to target with glass we turned to the clash and hff initiatives for the unique data that are being accumulated by a variety of groups with hst and other facilities",
    "this vast array of data makes the identification of emission lines much easier than for clusters with just a few hst filters , e.g. allowing for the use of the dropout technique to confirm that a single emission line is indeed ly@xmath4 , and of photo-@xmath18s to resolve cases with multiple line identifications .",
    "we further pruned the list of glass and clash clusters , using cluster redshift as an additional criterion .",
    "in fact , clusters at @xmath62 are the best gravitational telescopes for two reasons : i ) the size of the critical lines is well matched to the wfc3 field of view ; ii ) cluster galaxies appear smaller and fainter than in lower redshift clusters , thus minimizing the foreground contamination for background sources .",
    "the final requirement is given by the ability to observe h@xmath4 in cluster galaxies ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "based on these criteria we selected the sample of ten clusters at @xmath55 listed in table  [ tab : sample ] .",

    "this contamination level is defined as the fraction of pixels in the fits - extension of the extracted 2d spectra containing the contamination model ( masked by the object model extension ) with @xmath95e / s / pixel .",
    "apart from the manually set keywords and the automatic contamination estimate , the spectral coverage of each spectrum is also estimated and stored automatically in the output file .",
    "gigz is developed for general inspection of the extracted 1d spectra , the inspection of the redshift fits generated as described by @xcite , and for manual redshift fitting of any detected emission lines . the default gui window shown for gigz v1.0 in figure  [ fig : gigz ]",
    "enables quality assessment of the redshift fits and flagging of particular lines identified for easy identification of , e.g. , [ ] emitters in the data set .",
    "gigz also includes an interactive plotting interface which can be controlled from the main window .",
    "this enables a convenient way of plotting and inspecting the extracted 1d spectra , the redshift models , and any emission lines identified in the gig inspection .",
    "twodimensional fits files of the spectra can also be inspected through gig via a ds9 interface ."

    "<S> we give an overview of the grism lens amplified survey from space ( glass ) , a large hubble space telescope program aimed at obtaining grism spectroscopy of the fields of ten massive clusters of galaxies at redshift @xmath0 , including the hubble frontier fields ( hff ) . the wide field camera 3 yields near infrared spectra of the cluster cores , covering the wavelength range @xmath1 through grisms g102 and g141 , while the advanced camera for surveys in parallel mode provides g800l spectra of the infall regions of the clusters . </S>",
    "<S> the wfc3 spectra are taken at two almost orthogonal position angles in order to minimize the effects of confusion . </S>",
    "<S> after summarizing the scientific drivers of glass , we describe the sample selection as well as the observing strategy and data processing pipeline . we then utilize macsj0717.5 + 3745 , a hff cluster and the first one observed by glass , to illustrate the data quality and the high - level data products . </S>",
    "<S> each spectrum brighter than h@xmath2 is visually inspected by at least two co - authors and a redshift is measured when sufficient information is present in the spectra . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we conducted a thorough search for emission lines through all the glass wfc3 spectra with the aim of measuring redshifts for sources with continuum fainter than h@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we provide a catalog of 139emission - line based spectroscopic redshifts for extragalactic sources , including three new redshifts of multiple image systems ( one probable , two tentative ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the data itself we also release software tools that are helpful to navigate the data . </S>"
