    "semiconductor devices have been continuously downscaled ever since the invention of the first transistor @xcite , such that the size of the single building component of modern electronic devices has already reached to a few nanometers ( nm ) .",
    "in such a @xmath6 regime , two conceptual changes are required in the device modeling methodology .",
    "one aspect is widely accepted where carriers must be treated as quantum mechanical rather than classical objects . the second change is the need to embrace the multi - band models which can describe atomic features of materials , reproducing experimentally verified bulk bandstuructures . while the single - band effective mass approximation ( ema ) predicts bandstructures reasonably well near the conduction band minimum ( cbm ) , the subband quantization loses accuracy if devices are in a sub - nm regime @xcite .",
    "the ema also fails to predict indirect gaps , inter - band coupling and non - parabolicity in bulk bandstructures @xcite .",
    "the nearest - neighbor empirical tight - binding ( tb ) and next nearest - neighbor @xmath0@xmath1@xmath2 ( kp ) approach are most widely used band models of multiple bases @xcite .",
    "the most sophisticated tb model uses a set of 10 localized orbital bases ( s , s * , 3@xmath7p , and 5@xmath7d ) on real atomic grids ( 20 with spin interactions ) , where the parameter set is fit to reproduce experimentally verified bandgaps , masses , non - parabolic dispersions , hydrostatic and biaxial strain behaviors of bulk materials using a global minimization procedure based on a genetic algorithm and analytical insights @xcite .",
    "this @xmath8 tb approach can easily incorporate atomic effects such as surface roughness and random alloy compositions as the model is based on a set of atomic grids .",
    "these physical effects have been shown to be critical to the quantitative modeling of resonance tunneling diodes ( rtds ) , quantum dots , disordered sige / si quantum wells , and a single impurity device in si bulk @xcite .    the kp approach typically uses four bases on a set of cubic grids with no spin interactions @xcite .",
    "while it still fails to predict the indirect gap of bulk dispersions since it assumes that all the subband minima are placed on the @xmath9 point , the credibility is better than the ema since the kp model can still explain the inter - band physics of direct gap iii - v devices , and valence band physics of indirect gap materials such as silicon ( si ) @xcite .",
    "one of the important issues in modeling of nanoscale devices , is to solve the quantum transport problem with a consideration of real 3-d device geometries .",
    "although the non - equilibrium green s function ( negf ) and wavefunction ( wf ) formalism have been widely used to simulate the carrier transport @xcite , the computational burden has been always a critical problem in solving 3-d open systems as the negf formalism needs to invert a system matrix of a degree - of - freedom ( dof ) equal to the hamiltonian matrix @xcite .",
    "the recursive green s function ( rgf ) method saves the computing load by selectively targeting elements needed for the matrix inversion @xcite .",
    "however , the cost can be still huge depending on the area of the transport - orthogonal plane ( cross - section ) and the length along the transport direction of target devices @xcite .",
    "the wf algorithm also saves the computing load if the transport is ballistic as it does nt have to invert the system matrix and finding a few solutions of the linear system is enough to predict the transport behaviors .",
    "but , the load still depends on the size of the system matrix and the number of solution vectors ( modes ) needed to describe the carrier - injection from external leads @xcite . in fact , rgf and wf calculations for atomically resolved nanowire field effect transistors ( fets ) have demonstrated the need to consume over 200,000 parallel cores on large supercomputing clusters @xcite .    developed by mamaluy _",
    "@xcite , the contact block reduction ( cbr ) method has received much attention due to the utility to save computing expense required to evaluate the retarded green s function of 3-d open systems .",
    "the cbr method is thus expected to be a good candidate for transport simulations since the method does nt have to solve the linear system yet reducing the computing load needed for matrix inversion @xcite .",
    "the method indeed has been extensively used such that it successfully modeled electron quantum transport in experimentally realized si finfets @xcite , and predicted optimal design points and process variations in design of 10-nm si finfets @xcite .",
    "however , all the successful applications for 3-d systems so far , have been demonstrated only for the systems represented by the ema .",
    "while the use of multi - band approaches can increase the accuracy of simulation results , it requires more computing load as a dof of the hamiltonian matrix is directly proportional to the number of bases required to represent a single atomic ( or grid ) spot in the device geometry . to suggest a solution to this _ trade - off _ issue",
    ", we examine the numerical utilities of the cbr method in multi - band ballistic quantum transport simulations , focusing on multi - band 3-d systems represented by either of the tb or kp band model .",
    "the objective of this work is to provide detail answers to the following questions through simulations of small two - contact ballistic systems focusing on a proof of principles : ( 1 ) can the original cbr method be extended to simulate ballistic quantum transport of multi - band systems ? ( 2 ) if the answer to the question ( 1 ) is @xmath10 , what is the condition under which the multi - band cbr method becomes particularly useful ? , and ( 3 )",
    "how is the numerical practicality of the multi - band cbr method compared to the rgf and wf algorithms , in terms of the accuracy , speed and scalability on high performance computing ( hpc ) clusters ?",
    "in real transport problems , a device needs to be coupled with external contacts that allow the carrier - in - and - out flow . with the negf formalism ,",
    "this can be done by creating an open system that is described with a non - hermitian system matrix @xcite . representing this system matrix as a function of energy , we compute the transmission coefficient and density of states , to predict the current flow and charge profile in non - equilibrium .",
    "this energy - dependent system matrix is called the retarded green s function @xmath11 for an open system ( eq .",
    "( 1 ) ) .",
    "@xmath12^{-1 } , \\indent \\eta \\rightarrow 0^{+}\\ ] ]    where @xmath13 is is the hamiltonian representing the device and @xmath14 is the self - energy term that couples the device to external leads .",
    "as already mentioned in the previous section , the evaluation of @xmath11 is quite computationally expensive since it involves intensive matrix inversions .",
    "the cbr method , however , reduces matrix inversions with the mathematical process based on the dyson equation .",
    "we start the discussion revisiting the cbr method that has been so far utilized for ema systems .",
    "the cbr method starts decomposing the device domain into two regions : ( 1 ) the boundary region @xmath15 that couples with the contacts , and ( 2 ) the inner region @xmath16 that does nt couple to the contacts .",
    "as the self - energy term @xmath14 is non - zero only in the boundary region , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are decomposed as shown in eq .",

    ", we note that the matrix inversion is performed only to evaluate the boundary block @xmath27 ( contact - block ) for one time while the rgf needs to perform the block - inversion many times depending on the device channel length .",
    "the computing load for matrix inversion is thus significantly reduced , and the method is also free from solving a linear - system problem .",
    "instead , the major numerical issue now becomes a normal eigenvalue problem for a hermitian matrix ( @xmath13+@xmath21 ) .",
    "for the numerical practicality , it is thus critical to reduce a number of required eigenvalues , and for ema hamiltonian matrices , a huge reduction in the number of required eigenvalues can be achieved via a smart choice of the _ prescription matrix _ @xmath21 .        to find the matrix @xmath21 and see if it can be extended to multi - band systems , we first need to understand how to couple external contacts to the device . fig .",
    "1 illustrates the common approach which treats the contact as a semi - infinite nanowire of a finite cross - section . here , @xmath28 is a block matrix that represents the unit - slab along the transport direction , and @xmath29 is another block matrix which represent the inter - slab coupling .",
    "the eigenfunction of the plane wave at the @xmath30 mode in the @xmath31 slab , @xmath32 should then obey the schrdinger equation and the bloch condition ( eqs .",

    "then , the surface green s function @xmath36 and self - energy term @xmath14 can be evaluated by converting eqs .",

    "the important question here is then whether we can make the cbr method be still numerically practical for multi - band systems such that the transport can be simulated with a narrow energy spectrum . to study this issue ,",
    "we focus on the inter - slab coupling matrix @xmath29 of multi - band systems .",
    "a toy si device that consists of two slabs along the [ 100 ] direction , is used as an example for our discussion .    fig .",
    "2 shows the device geometry and corresponding hamiltonian matrix built with the ema , kp and tb model , respectively . here",
    ", we note that the simplifying process in eq .",
    "( 9 ) and eq . (",

    "2 , this makes the inter - slab coupling matrix @xmath29 be @xmath55 such that matrix inversions become impossible . the simplified solution for @xmath52 and @xmath14 in eq .",
    "( 9 ) and eq .",
    "( 10 ) are therefore mathematically invalid , and they can not be even used to approximate the full solution ( eqs .",
    "( 7 ) ) . a new prescription for @xmath21 is thus needed to make the cbr method",
    "be still practical for zb - tb systems , and we propose an alternative in eq .",
    "( 12 ) .    @xmath56    where @xmath57 is the energetic position of the cbm ( valence band maximum ( vbm ) ) of the bandstructure of the semi - infinite contact .    if only a few subbands near the cbm ( or vbm ) of the contact bandstructure are enough to describe the external contact , the prescription suggested in eq",
    "( 12 ) works quite well as @xmath21 is the hermitian part of the self - energy term , such that ( @xmath58 ) approximates the open system near the edge of the contact bandstructure , the approximation , however , becomes less accurate if more subbands in higher energy ( in lower energy for valence band ) are involved to the open boundaries .",
    "away from the band edge , subband placement becomes denser and inter - subband coupling becomes stronger .",
    "the prescription @xmath21 in eq .",
    "( 12 ) then would not be a good choice as it only approximate the open boundary solution near band edges , and the cbr method thus needs more eigenspectrums to solve open boundary transport problems .",
    "so , for example , the multi - band cbr method would not be numerically practical to simulate fets at a high source - drain bias , since a broad energy spectrum is then needed to get an accurate solution .    before closing this section , we note that , if the inter - slab coupling matrix @xmath29 is either an identity matrix or a scaled identity matrix , the prescription matrix @xmath21 in eq .",
    "( 12 ) becomes @xmath59 to the one utilized to simulate 3-d systems in the previous literatures @xcite , where ( @xmath58 ) approximates the open system well near @xmath60 @xmath61 @xmath62 if the system is represented by the ema @xcite .",
    "once @xmath52 and @xmath14 are determined from the prescription matrix @xmath21 , evaluation of the transmission coefficient ( tr ) and the density of states ( dos ) can be easily done @xcite .",
    "further detailed mathematics regarding derivation of tr and dos will not be thus discussed here .",
    "the results are discussed in two subsections .",
    "first , we validate the cbr method for multi - band systems with the new prescription for @xmath21 in eq .",
    "focusing on a proof of principles , we compute the tr and dos profiles for a toy tb and kp system , compare the result to the references obtained with the rgf algorithm , and suggest the device category where the multi - band cbr method could be particularly practical .",
    "second , we examine the numerical practicality of the multi - band cbr method by computing tr and dos profiles of a resonant tunneling device and a nanowire fet .",
    "the accuracy , the speed of calculations in a serial mode , and the scalability on hpc clusters , are compared to those obtained with the rgf and wf algorithm .",
    "we assume a two - contact ballistic transport for all the numerical problems .      to validate the multi - band cbr method that has been discussed in the previous section , we consider two multi - band toy si systems represented by the 10-band @xmath8 tb and 3-band kp approach .",
    "here , we intentionally choose extremely small systems to calculate a complete set of energy spectra of the hamiltonian , with which the cbr method should produce results identical to the ones obtained by the rgf algorithm .",
    "for the tb system , the electron - transport is simulated while we calculate the hole - transport for the kp system due to a limitation of the kp approach in representing the si material @xcite .    _",
    "tb system _ : fig .",
    "3 illustrates the tr and dos profile calculated for the tb si toy device which consists of ( 2@xmath72@xmath72 ) ( 100 ) unit - cells ( @xmath631.1(nm ) ) .",
    "the device involves a complex hermitian hamiltonian matrix of 640 dof , and electrons are assumed to transport along the [ 100 ] direction .",
    "the tr and dos profiles are calculated using the cbr method for a total of three cases - with 6 , 60 and full ( 640 ) energy spectra that correspond to 1@xmath64 , 10@xmath64 , and 100@xmath64 of the hamiltonian dof , respectively .",
    "the transport happens at the energy above 2.32(ev ) which is the cbm of the contact bandstructure .",
    "we note that this energetic position is higher than the si bulk cbm ( 1.13(ev ) ) , due to the structural confinement stemming from the finite cross - section of the nanowire device @xcite .        with the new prescription matrix @xmath21 suggested in eq .",
    "( 12 ) , the tr and dos profile obtained by the cbr method become closer to the reference result as more spectrums are used , and eventually reproduce the reference result with a full set of spectrums , as shown in the left column of fig .",
    "3 . here , the cbr result turns out to be quite accurate near the cbm even with 1@xmath64 of the total spectrums , indicating that the tb - cbr method could be a practical approach if most of the carriers are injected from the first one or two subbands of the contact bandstructure",
    ". this condition can be satisfied when ( 1 ) only the first one or two subbands in the contact bandstructure are occupied with electrons , and ( 2 ) the energy difference between the source and drain contact fermi - level ( the source - drain fermi - window ) becomes extremely narrow .",
    "so , the simulation of fets at a high source - drain bias would not be an appropriate target of the tb - cbr simulations since the source - drain fermi - window may include many subbands , and many spectra may be thus needed for accurate solutions @xcite .",
    "instead , we propose that rtds could be one of device categories for which the tb - cbr method is particularly practical , since the fermi - window for transport becomes extremely small in rtds in some cases @xcite .        the same calculation is performed again but using the old prescription @xmath21 suggested for the ema , and corresponding tr and dos profiles are shown in the right column of fig .",
    "3 . the cbr method still reproduce the reference result with a full set of energy spectra since the dyson equation ( eq .",
    "( 4 ) ) should always work for any @xmath21 s .",
    "the accuracy of the results near the cbm , however , turns out to be worse than the one with the new prescription .",
    "the results furthermore reveal that the accuracy with 10@xmath64 of the total spectra does not necessarily becomes better than the one with 1@xmath64 , indicating that the old prescription for @xmath21 can not even approximate the solution near the cbm of open tb systems .",

    "the structure is discretized with a 0.2(nm ) grid and involves a complex hermitian hamiltonian of 3,000 dof . here , the dof of the real - space kp hamiltonian can be effectively reduced with the @xmath65-@xmath66 approach @xcite .",
    "the effective dof of the hamiltonian therefore becomes 500 , where we consider 50 modes per each slab along the transport direction .",
    "again , we note that the vbm of the contact bandstructure is placed at -0.4(ev ) , and lower in energy than the vbm of si bulk ( 0(ev ) ) due to the confinement created by the finite cross - section .",

    "we therefore measure the time needed to evaluate the tr and dos per single energy point for the tb si : p rtd and the kp si nanowire fet represented that are utilized as simulation examples . to examine the practicality of the multi - band cbr method on hpc clusters",
    ", we also benchmark the scalability of the simulation time on the @xmath74 cluster under the support of the rosen center for advanced computing ( rcac ) at purdue university .",
    "the cbr , rgf , and wf methods are parallelized with mpi / c++ , the multifrontal massively parallel sparse direct linear solver ( mumps ) @xcite , and a self - developed eigensolver based on the shift - and - invert arnoldi algorithm @xcite .",
    "all the measurements are performed on a 64-bit , 8-core hp proliant dl585 g5 system of 16 gb sdram and 10-gigabit ethernet local to each node .",
    "table i summarizes the wall - times measured for various methods in a serial mode .",
    "generally , the simulation of the kp si nanowire fet needs less computing loads , such that the wall - times are reduced by a factor of two with respect to the computing time taken for the tb si : p rtd .",
    "this is because the kp approach can represent the electronic structure with the mode - space approach such that the hamiltonian matrix has a smaller dof ( 9,000 ) , compared to the one used to describe the tb si : p rtd ( 18,720 ) .",
    "compared to the rgf algorithm in a serial mode , the cbr method demonstrates a comparable ( kp ) , or better ( tb ) performance . since a single slab of the kp si nanowire",
    "is represented with a block matrix @xmath75 ( fig .",
    "1 ) of 120 dof , the matrix inversion is not a critical problem any more in the rgf algorithm such that the cbr method does nt necessarily show better performances than the rgf algorithm .",
    "the tb example device , however , needs a @xmath75 of 720 dof to represent a single slab ( a total of 26 slabs ) so the burden for matrix inversions become bigger compared to the kp example . as a result",
    ", the cbr method generally shows better performances .",
    "the cbr method , however , does nt beat the wf method in both the tb and kp case since , in a serial mode , the cbr method consumes time to allocate a huge memory space that is needed to store `` full '' complex matrices via vector - products ( eqs .",
    "( 5 ) ) .",
    "the strength of the cbr method emerges in a @xmath76 mode ( on multiple cpus ) , where the vector - products are performed via mpi - communication among distributed systems and each node thus saves only a fraction of the full matrix .",
    "the scalability of the various methods is compared up to a total of 16 cpus in fig .",
    "the common rgf calculation can be effectively parallelized only up to a factor of two , due to its recursive nature @xcite , and the scalability of the wf method becomes worse in many cpus because it uses a direct - solver - based lu factorization to solve the linear system .",
    "as a result , the cbr method starts to show the best speed when more than 8 cpus are used .",
    "in this work , we discuss numerical utilities of the cbr method in simulating ballistic transport of multi - band systems described by the the atomic 10-band @xmath8 tb and 3-band kp approach .",
    "although the original cbr method developed for single - band ema systems achieves an excellent numerical efficiency by approximating solutions of open systems , we show that the same approach ca nt be used to approximate tb systems as the inter - slab coupling matrix becomes singular .",
    "we therefore develop an alternate method to approximate open system solutions . focusing on a proof of principles on small systems",
    ", we validate the idea by comparing the tr and dos profile to the reference result obtained by the rgf algorithm , where the alternative also works well with the kp approach .",
    "since the major numerical issue in the cbr method is to solve a normal eigenvalue problem , the numerical practicality of the method becomes better as the transport can be solved with a less number of energy spectra . generally , the practicality would be thus limited in multi - band systems , since multi - band approaches need a larger number of spectra to cover a certain range of energy than the single band ema does .",
    "we , however , claim that the rtds could be one category of tb devices , for which the multi - band cbr method becomes particularly practical in simulating transport , and the numerical utility can be even extended to fets when the cbr method is coupled to the kp band model . to support this argument",
    ", we simulate the electron resonance tunneling in a 3-d tb rtd , which is basically a si nanowire but has a single phosphorous donor in the channel center , and the hole - transport of a 3-d kp si nanowire fet .",
    "we examine numerical practicalities of the multi - band cbr method in terms of the accuracy and speed , with respect to the reference results obtained by the rgf and wf algorithm , and observe that the cbr method gives fairly accurate tr and dos profile near band edges of contact bandstructures .    in terms of the speed in a serial mode ,",
    "the strength of the cbr method over the rgf algorithm depends on the size of the hamiltonian such that the cbr shows a better performance than the rgf as a larger block - matrix is required to represent the unit - slab of devices .",
    "but , the speed of the wf method is still better than the cbr method as the cbr method consumes time to store a full complex matrix during the process of calculations . in a parallel mode",
    ", however , the cbr method starts to beat both the rgf and wf algorithm since the full matrix can be stored into multiple clusters in a distributive manner , while the scalability of both the rgf and wf algorithm are limited due to the nature of recursive and direct - solver - based calculation , respectively .",
