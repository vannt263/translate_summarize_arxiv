    "race - track microtron ( rtm ) is a specific type of electron accelerator with beam recirculation combining properties of the linear accelerator and a circular machine  @xcite . for applications",
    "in which a modest beam power at a relatively high beam energy is required the rtm turns out to be the most optimal source of electron beams .",
    "this is the case of applications like the cargo inspection or intraoperative radiation therapy for which rtms allow to get pulsed and continuous beams in a quite cost and energy effective way with the most optimal dimensions of the machine .",
    "an example of such accelerator is a compact 12 mev rtm which is under construction at the technical university of catalonia in collaboration with the moscow state university and ciemat ( spain )  @xcite .    in the design of a particle accelerator",
    "its main parameters are optimized for some reference particle , usually referred to as synchronous particle .",
    "real particles of the beam perform transverse and longitudinal oscillations with respect to this synchronous particle .",
    "one of the important issues of the rtm design is to assure the stability of these oscillations , in particular to avoid an uncontrolled growth of their amplitude that leads to the loss of the beam . in the rtm beam dynamics the main role",
    "is played by longitudinal oscillations of individual electrons with respect to the synchronous particle  @xcite .",
    "such oscillations are usually referred to as phase motion , and the region of initial states in the phase space which give rise to stable oscillations is called acceptance .",
    "stability of the phase oscillations of particles in the beam is a matter of primary concern both at the stage of the accelerator design and during its operation . in particular",
    ", the size of the acceptance determines the efficiency of caption into acceleration of particles injected from a source of electrons , usually an electron gun .",
    "the shape and size of the acceptance depend on the phase of the synchronous particle , also called synchronous phase and denoted as @xmath0 along this paper .",
    "the definition of these notions will be given in section  [ sec : rtmmodel ] .",
    "a specific feature of the rtm is that the range of values of @xmath0 for which the acceptance exists is quite narrow and therefore this parameter must be carefully chosen and controlled during the rtm operation .",
    "the main criteria here is to keep the synchronous phase equal or close to the value for which the size of the acceptance is maximal and to avoid resonant values of @xmath0 .",
    "the latter is important because resonant phase oscillations lead to a buildup of beam instabilities , rapid growth of the amplitude of the phase oscillations and eventually to a loss of the beam .",
    "therefore , a good understanding of the longitudinal dynamics of the beam in rtms in general and the phase oscillations of electrons in a particular machine is important .",
    "the phase oscillations of the beam in an rtm are described by a system of nonlinear difference equations  @xcite that will be derived in section  [ sec : rtmmodel ] .",
    "it gives rise to an analytic area preserving map which is the object of study in the present paper .",
    "these difference equations can not be approximated by differential equations without loss of accuracy , since rtms have large energy gain per turn and high frequency of phase oscillations .",
    "the description of the acceptance in the linear approximation is well known  @xcite .",
    "the change of the acceptance under the variation of the synchronous phase , the appearance of stable regions , and the emergence of the stochastic regime is studied in  @xcite by looking at the normal form of the difference equations up to order four .",
    "for instance , it was shown that there is a shift of the center of oscillations and that the oscillation frequency depends on the amplitude .",
    "we will reproduce these known results at the beginning of our analysis .    in the present paper",
    "we will study the phase motion of the beam in rtms using modern dynamical systems methods .",
    "our goal is to characterize the acceptance , called stability domain in dynamical systems , as a function of the synchronous phase . in particular , we will establish the intervals of values of @xmath0 for which the acceptance and its central connected component exist , analyze their geometry , shape and size , and calculate their area for the whole range of @xmath0 .",
    "our main theoretical tools are the moser twist theorem and several sim s stability results  @xcite .",
    "we will also approximate some rotational invariant curves of the rtm beam longitudinal dynamics by level curves of suitable hamiltonians .",
    "finally , we will carry out a global study of the acceptance and its connected component using results and algorithms , like the orbit method , developed in  @xcite .",
    "the article is organized as follows .",
    "we give a short introduction into the rtm beam longitudinal dynamics , define the notion of synchronous trajectory and synchronous phase and derive the map describing the longitudinal beam dynamics that we will refer to as rtm map in section  [ sec : rtmmodel ] .",
    "we introduce the notion of the acceptance and its connected component , we find fixed points of the rtm map and analyze their type in the linear approximation in section  [ sec : mainresult ] .",
    "we also formulate a theorem about the local stability of the synchronous trajectory and give a summary of further results on the behavior of the acceptance as a function of the synchronous phase .",
    "the proof of the theorem is given in section  [ sec : localstability ] .",
    "section  [ sec : hamiltonianapproximations ] is devoted to the approximation of the rtm map by the integrable dynamics of certain hamiltonians and correspondingly the approximation of the invariant curves around the synchronous trajectory by means of hamiltonian level curves .",
    "the global stability of the synchronous trajectory is studied in section  [ sec : globalstability ] , also a detailed characterization of the acceptance is given there .",
    "these results are obtained numerically by using the orbit method .",
    "the invariant curves of hyperbolic points are analyzed in section  [ sec : invariantcurves ] . a summary and a discussion of the obtained results",
    "are given in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the operation of a race - track microtron ( rtm ) is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : microtronscheme ] . the initial beam is injected from an electron source ( electron gun or external pre - accelerator ) into an accelerating structure ( as ) consisting of a few resonant cavities .",
    "the longitudinal electric component of a high frequency electromagnetic wave ( usually a standing wave ) accelerates the electrons in the as .",
    "then the beam is bent by the magnetic field of a @xmath1 bending magnet , called _ end magnet _ , travels through a free space , usually referred to as _ drift space _ , follows along a circular trajectory inside the second end magnet and returns to the as . in this way",
    "the beam makes a number of recirculations through the rtm with the energy being increased at each pass through the as .",
    "once the beam gets the final design energy , it is deflected by an extraction magnet and is directed towards the accelerator beam exit .",
    "we approximate the as by a zero length accelerating gap and consider a stationary regime with a constant amplitude of the accelerating field .",
    "then the energy gain of an electron passing through the as is equal to @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the maximum energy gain in the as and @xmath4 is the phase of the accelerating field . in accelerator physics",
    "this parameter is usually referred to as particle phase and is used to characterize the longitudinal position of the particle along the orbit with respect to the accelerating gap ( in a real machine with respect to , say , the exit , of the last cavity of the as in the direction of the beam motion ) .",
    "another idealization in our study is that the end magnets will be considered as hard - edge dipole magnets so that the fringe - field effects are not taken into account .",
    "let us consider the longitudinal ( phase ) motion of electrons in an rtm with magnetic field induction @xmath5 in the end magnets and separation @xmath6 between the magnets ( straight section length ) .",
    "we assume that the injected electrons are already ultra - relativistic , so that in the formulas below the velocity of the particles in the beam is equal to the velocity of light @xmath7 .",
    "our dynamical variables are the full particle energy @xmath8 and its phase @xmath9 at the @xmath10-th turn at some point of the orbit . for the sake of convenience , we choose this point to be the exit of the as .",
    "let @xmath11 and @xmath12 be the particle phase and energy at the injection ; that is , just before its first passage through the as .",
    "we would like to note that , in some pulsed rtm , the electrons reverse their trajectory in special reverse field magnets after the injection and first acceleration at the as  @xcite . in that case",
    ", @xmath12 is the energy after the first acceleration and reflection of the beam in the end magnet , before the second passage through the as , but we will still use the term injection energy .        for the rtm model described above",
    ", the duration of the @xmath10-th revolution of the beam is @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the elementary charge and @xmath15 is the beam trajectory radius in the end magnets .",
    "we have used that @xmath16 in bending magnets for ultrarelativistic beams  @xcite .",
    "relation  ( [ eq : timeenergy ] ) allows us to work indistinctly with time variables @xmath17 or energy variables @xmath8 .",
    "the beam dynamics in the phase - energy variables , for a zero - length as , is governed by the difference equations @xmath18 @xmath19 being the period of the accelerating electromagnetic field , usually called _ radiofrequency ( rf ) field _ in the context of accelerator beam dynamics .",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "the design of a particle accelerator requires a proper choice of physical and technical parameters in order to guarantee the existence of a reference trajectory , called _ synchronous trajectory _ , so that an ideal particle following this trajectory is accelerated in the most optimal way .",
    "namely , it can be tuned in resonance with the accelerating field .",
    "let us explain the choice of parameters in case of an rtm .",
    "we fix two positive integers @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the resonance conditions in the case of an rtm are @xmath22 henceforth , the subindex `` @xmath23 '' indicates quantities related to the synchronous trajectory . the integer @xmath20 is the number of rf field periods during the first turn and defines the synchronicity condition at this turn , whereas @xmath21 is the increase of the multiplicity factor due to the increase of the period of revolution of the reference particle in each turn .",
    "the ratio @xmath24 is called _",
    "harmonic number_. rtms are accelerators with variable harmonic numbers , since @xmath25 depends on the @xmath10-th turn .",
    "if we rewrite the resonance conditions  ( [ eq : resonanceconditionsintime ] ) using the energy variables @xmath26 and relation  ( [ eq : timeenergy ] ) , we get that @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the wavelength of the rf field . finally , it is straightforward to check that if the injection phase for the synchronous trajectory @xmath30 satisfies relation @xmath31 then we get a particular solution @xmath32 of equations  ( [ eq : timeenergy])([eq : dynamics_in_phi_e ] ) , whose energy undergoes a constant gain @xmath33 at each turn : @xmath34 with @xmath35 .",
    "we note that @xmath36 , so this synchronous particle passes through the as in the same phase of the rf field at each turn : @xmath37 ( mod @xmath38 ) for all @xmath10 .",
    "we say that @xmath0 is the _",
    "synchronous phase_.    once we realize that the synchronous trajectory  ( [ eq : synchronousdynamics ] ) exists , we wonder whether the oscillations of other trajectories around it are stable .",
    "this depends on the synchronous phase @xmath0 .",
    "we study this dependence by introducing the variables @xmath39 that describe the phase and energy deviation of an arbitrary trajectory from the synchronous one .",
    "then the beam dynamics is modeled by the map @xmath40 , where @xmath41 for simplicity , we will assume that @xmath42 in the rest of the paper .",
    "the study of other values can be carried out in a similar way .",
    "we end this section by stressing that the model of longitudinal oscillations around the synchronous trajectory for non - ultra - relativistic beams is more complicated  @xcite .",
    "under the assumption @xmath43 , our model for the nonlinear oscillations around the synchronous trajectory  ( [ eq : synchronousdynamics ] ) is the analytic area preserving diffeomorphism @xmath44 , defined by @xmath45 here , @xmath46 is a parameter , and @xmath47 ( respectively , @xmath48 ) is the deviation of the phase ( respectively , energy ) of an arbitrary particle from the phase ( respectively , energy ) of the synchronous trajectory , which corresponds to the fixed point @xmath49 the angular coordinate @xmath47 is defined modulo @xmath38 , so our phase space is @xmath50 , with @xmath51 . for brevity , we will write @xmath52 and @xmath53 . we look for initial conditions that give rise to particles with a bounded energy deviation from the synchronous trajectory .",
    "more precisely , we will estimate the size and the shape of @xmath54 this domain is called _ ( longitudinal ) acceptance _ in accelerator physics , and _ stability domain _ in dynamical systems .",
    "we will also study its connected component @xmath55 that contains @xmath56 .",

    "this means that trajectories with bounded energy deviation , have also bounded phase deviation respect to the synchronous one .",
    "the map @xmath63 , its acceptance @xmath59 , and the connected component @xmath64 depend on @xmath65 , but we will frequently omit this dependence . otherwise , we will write @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 , respectively .",
    "we say that the synchronous trajectory is :    * _ globally stable _ when @xmath64 is a neighborhood of @xmath56 ; * _ locally stable _",
    "when @xmath69 there exists @xmath70 such that @xmath71 * _ linearly stable _ when the sequence @xmath72 is bounded , where @xmath73 is the linear part of the map @xmath63 at @xmath56 ; that is , when the linearized map @xmath74 is locally stable .    otherwise , it is _ globally _ , _ locally _ , or _",

    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : afterparabolic4 ] .",
    "our map  ( [ eq : f ] ) shows the four possible combinations of local stability / instability and linear stability / instability .",
    "the synchronous trajectory is _ hyperbolic _ , _ parabolic _ , or _",
    "elliptic _ when the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath73 are real of modulus different from one , real of modulus equal to one , or non - real of modulus equal to one , respectively .",

    "nevertheless , following a standard terminology in dynamical systems , we will say that @xmath105 is the _ rotation number _ of the elliptic fixed point @xmath56 .",

    "on the one hand , we know that the red domains displayed in fig .  [ fig : stabilityregioncolor_fourthorderresonance ] , and in the left picture of fig .",
    "[ fig : stabilityregioncolor_loworderresonances ] are not completely filled with rics .",
    "indeed , kam theory implies that the set of all rics has a complicated cantorian structure , whose gaps are filled with resonances .",
    "let us explain why we do not see those resonances .",
    "we restrict our explanation to the case of fig .",
    "[ fig : stabilityregioncolor_fourthorderresonance ] , since the phenomenon is the same in both cases .",
    "we do not see any resonance inside the red zone displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : stabilityregioncolor_fourthorderresonance ] because @xmath119 when @xmath120 , see table  [ tab : relations ] .",
    "therefore , all missed resonances have orders @xmath121 , since @xmath122 is the rational number in the interval @xmath123 with the smallest denominator .",
    "such resonances are too small to be detected with our pixel resolution .",
    "we recall that a generic @xmath106-resonance in an @xmath124-neighborhood of an elliptic fixed point of an analytic area preserving map has an @xmath125-size  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the border of the connected component @xmath68 should be a red curve ( the lric ) , which is missing in the left picture of fig .",
    "[ fig : stabilityregioncolor_fourthorderresonance ] and in the three pictures of fig .",
    "[ fig : stabilityregioncolor_loworderresonances ] .",
    "the reason is , once more , that the lric is too thin to be detected with our pixel resolution . in the same way , probably there are some rics in the middle of the blue zone , which would mean that that blue zone is composed by several chaotic seas , instead of by a single big chaotic sea .",
    "we consider the sections of the stability domain with the symmetry lines  ( [ eq : fixedset ] ) for two reasons .",
    "first , the stability domain is symmetric with respect to these lines .",
    "second , we recall that each spo has exactly two points on these lines , and such spos are the basic invariant objects that organize the dynamics inside their resonance .",
    "we look at fig .",
    "[ fig : stabilityregioncolor_fourthorderresonance ] to understand how spos organize the resonant dynamics .",
    "we see an elliptic @xmath126-spo with two points on @xmath127 that organizes the stable dynamics inside the four big green elliptic islands , and a hyperbolic @xmath126-spo with two points on @xmath128 whose stable and unstable invariant curves delimit almost perfectly the red region `` filled '' with rics .",
    "we do not deal with each one - dimensional section as a separate object , but we gather them into the two - dimensional sets : @xmath129 in order to visualize their evolution in the parameter @xmath65 .",

    "we see that the connected component @xmath68 collapses to the elliptic fixed point at @xmath130 , and undergoes its major loss at some @xmath131 .",

    "the loss takes place when the fourth order resonance is thrown away .",

    "resonances emanate from the elliptic fixed point @xmath56 in the form of thin blue and green tongues , since they are sections of chaotic seas surrounding elliptic islands .",
    "these tongues begin at the points @xmath134 , where @xmath135 is defined as in  ( [ eq : mu0 ] ) for any rational number @xmath136 , so there are infinitely many of such tongues . besides , they look symmetric with respect to the vertical line @xmath137 in a neighborhood of that line . the resonances , but the @xmath126-one , have a small width when they are close to @xmath56 .",

    "the elliptic islands inside a resonance grow in size when they move away from @xmath56 .",
    "if the resonance has even order , then the green part becomes the biggest part of the tongue in the set @xmath133 , but not in the set @xmath132 .",
    "this means that each elliptic spo with even period has two points on @xmath127 , but none on @xmath128 .",

    "the other branch remains blue .",
    "this is a completely expected behavior , since we know that all spos with odd period have just one point on each symmetry line .",
    "we warn that red and green regions should not be in direct contact , but we have again difficulties to detect the blue chaotic seas between them with our current pixel resolution .",
    "resonances are thrown away from @xmath64 , which is the reason for the saw - like border of @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "once a green tongue is separated from the main red body in the @xmath47-direction , it is no longer delimited by blue portions , because chaotic seas do not form part of @xmath59 when their resonances are thrown away .",

    "such limitations were recently overcome in  @xcite .",
    "the stable and unstable invariant curves of hyperbolic ( fixed or periodic ) points organize the dynamics of area preserving maps in several ways .",
    "let us just mention two of them .",
    "on the one hand , some of these invariant curves are approximate boundaries of stability domains  @xcite , in which case the area of the lobes between them is equal to the flux through certain closed curves composed by arcs of invariant curves  @xcite .",

    "we recall that @xmath152 , so @xmath153 as @xmath154 .",
    "ten years later , gelfreich  @xcite derived an asymptotic formula for the splitting angle between the separatrices in analytic saddle - center bifurcations , although he did not provide a complete proof .",
    "gelfreich s formula , once adapted to our map , says that @xmath155 as @xmath156 for some constant @xmath157 .",
    "our numerical experiments strongly suggest that there exist some asymptotic coefficients @xmath158 , @xmath159 , such that @xmath160 this fits perfectly with both fontich - sim s upper bound , and gelfreich s asymptotic formula .",
    "our refined asymptotic formula  ( [ eq : asymptoticformula ] ) means that if we retain only finitely many terms of the right - hand side , then the error will be of the order of the first discarded term .",
    "such refined asymptotic formulas in singular splitting problems were first presented in  @xcite for the standard map , and first proved in  @xcite for the perturbed mcmillan map .    besides",
    ", we have numerically seen that the first asymptotic coefficient in formula  ( [ eq : asymptoticformula ] ) is non - zero : @xmath161 whereas the second asymptotic coefficient vanishes : @xmath162 , so the approximation @xmath163 has an @xmath164 relative error .",
    "we have also checked that the asymptotic series @xmath165 is divergent , but its borel transform @xmath166 has radius of convergence @xmath167 .",
    "this is a typical behaviour for many other maps , see  @xcite .",
    "let us consider the closed curve formed by the unstable invariant curve from the saddle point @xmath95 to the primary homoclinic point on some fixed symmetry line plus the stable invariant curve from that primary point to @xmath95 .",
    "this closed curve encloses a planar domain @xmath168 slightly bigger than the stability domain @xmath59 , see fig .",

    "this means that after @xmath173 iterates of the map @xmath63 , less than three thousandths parts of the points inside @xmath168 have escaped .",
    "thus , one may approximate the stability domain @xmath59 by the region @xmath168 in many practical situations .",

    "these ideas have been used in  @xcite .",

    "we saw in section  [ ssec : hamiltonianthirdorder ] that the third power of the map  ( [ eq : f ] ) is approximated , after the rescaling  ( [ eq : scaling_thirdorder ] ) , by the @xmath174-time flow of the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : h1_thirdorderresonance ] ) when @xmath175 with @xmath176 . besides , the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : h1_thirdorderresonance ] ) has three saddle points whose invariant curves coincide giving rise to the triangle sketched in fig .  [",
    "fig : h1_thirdorderresonance ] .",
    "if @xmath177 , then the stability domain of the map  ( [ eq : f ] ) has a central part with a triangular shape , that contains many rics , and three `` sheets '' , that contain points with rotation number equal to @xmath178 , attached to the vertices of that `` triangle '' .",
    "the vertices of this `` triangle '' correspond to hyperbolic three - periodic points whose stable and unstable invariant curves do not coincide .",
    "there are two different splitting phenomena in this setting .",
    "namely , the inner splitting ( associated to the invariant curves that enclose the `` triangle '' ) and the outer splitting ( associated to the invariant curves that enclose the `` sheets '' ) .",

    "second , let @xmath188 $ ] be the value at which the third - order resonance is thrown away from @xmath64 . then @xmath184 is a really good approximation of the connected component @xmath64 when @xmath189 .",
    "the singular splitting near resonances of order @xmath190 shares several qualitative and quantitative features with the singular splitting near the saddle - center bifurcation and near the third - order resonance .",
    "let us explain this .",
    "let @xmath135 and @xmath191 be the values at which the @xmath106-resonance emanates from @xmath56 and is thrown away from @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "let @xmath192 ( respectively , @xmath193 ) be the region enclosed by suitable parts of the inner ( respectively , enclosed between suitable parts of the inner and outer ) branches of the stable and unstable invariant curves of the hyperbolic @xmath106-periodic points .",
    "the inner region usually looks like a red `` polygon '' with @xmath10 curved sides , because it is almost completely foliated by rics .",
    "the outer region contains the @xmath106-periodic chain of elliptic islands , and it also contains part of its surrounding chaotic sea before the @xmath106-resonance is thrown away .",
    "see figures  [ fig : stabilityregioncolor_fourthorderresonance ] and  [ fig : stabilityregioncolor_loworderresonances ] for several pictures about the resonances @xmath194    since the flux through the borders of the inner and outer regions can be geometrically interpreted as the area of certain lobes  @xcite , we obtain the following information about the inner and outer flux . the inner flux is smaller than the outer flux , and",
    "both of them are exponentially small in @xmath195  @xcite .",
    "the inner region is a good approximation of the connected component @xmath64 when @xmath189 .",
    "see , for instance , the right picture in figure  [ fig : stabilityregioncolor_fourthorderresonance ] . the inner and outer regions are not completely contained in the stability domain when @xmath196 , since there is a small , but not zero , flux through their borders  @xcite .       and",

    "the hyperbolic / elliptic fixed point is marked with a black rhombus / triangle .",
    "the hyperbolic / elliptic 3-periodic points are marked with black squares / circles .",
    "the stable and unstable invariant curves of the hyperbolic fixed point ( respectively , 3-periodic points ) are displayed in red ( respectively , in blue).,height=230 ]    we recall the obstruction criterion for the existence of rics stated in  @xcite .",
    "if an area - preserving twist diffeomorphism on the annulus @xmath50 has two hyperbolic periodic orbits of rotation numbers @xmath199 such that their stable and unstable invariant curves intersect transversally , then the map has no ric with a rotation number @xmath200 $ ] .",
    "let @xmath63 be the map  ( [ eq : f ] ) .",

    "if the invariant curves of @xmath203 intersect transversally the invariant curves of a hyperbolic @xmath106-periodic orbit of the map , then the map has no ric with rotation number @xmath204 $ ] and the @xmath106-resonance has already escaped from the connected component @xmath64 .",
    "therefore , we should expect that the exact value @xmath205 at which the @xmath106-resonance escapes from @xmath64 coincides with the bifurcation value at which the invariant curves of the hyperbolic @xmath106-periodic orbit have their first contact with the invariant curves of @xmath203 .",
    "let us present a concrete application of this idea .",
    "we have already seen that the @xmath197-resonance escapes from @xmath64 at some value @xmath206 by means of the brute force method used in subsection  [ ssec : stabilitydomain ] .",
    "next , we study this escape with the obstruction criterion .",
    "we have drawn the stable and unstable invariant curves of @xmath203 and the hyperbolic @xmath197-periodic orbit for several values of the parameter @xmath65 in the interval @xmath207 .",
    "for instance , the @xmath197-resonance has already escaped from @xmath64 when @xmath198 , since the invariant curves drawn in figure  [ fig : obstructioncriterion_mu_2p9 ] intersect transversally .",
    "we have obtained similar pictures for @xmath208 , but the closer we are to @xmath205 , the bigger part of the invariant curves we have to draw in order to find intersections . in particular , pictures for @xmath209 and @xmath210 are far from pretty .",
    "we have not found an intersection for @xmath211 , because the computation and visualization of such a big part of the invariant curves is not an easy task .",
    "we have studied the stability of longitudinal beam motion in rtms .",
    "namely , we have analyzed the stability domain @xmath59 ( and its central connected component @xmath64 ) of the area - preserving map that describes the phase oscillations using standard dynamical systems tools .",
    "we have found the range of values of the synchronous phase @xmath0 for which @xmath59 and @xmath64 exist .",
    "we have studied their structure and calculated their area as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "the knowledge of @xmath59 , called longitudinal acceptance in the theory of particle accelerators , is of much importance for the optimization of the beam motion in rtms . indeed , the adjustment of machine parameters for the efficient acceleration of the beam during its commissioning consists in matching the domain in the phase space occupied by the particles emitted by an injector ( often an electron gun ) to the acceptance for a given value of @xmath0 . the optimal beam matching allows to minimize beam losses and undesired excess of strayed radiation produced by the accelerator and , so , maximize the output beam current without increasing the current at the injection . for the adjustment to be most efficient",
    ", the acceptance area must be maximal and the shape of the phase domain of the injected beam must fit the acceptance shape . therefore , our detailed analysis of the acceptance geometry could be useful .",
    "let us comment on two `` empirical '' rules used in particle accelerators  @xcite .",
    "the first rule claims that the values of @xmath0 for which an accelerator can operate are contained in the interval of linear stability of the synchronous trajectory . the second rule states that the optimal values of @xmath0 are close to the middle point of such interval . in our study",
    ", we have checked that both rules are in fact quite precise within our rtm model , where the interval of linear stability is @xmath212 , with @xmath213 first , we have numerically seen that @xmath214 for @xmath215 , except for the value @xmath216 that corresponds to the third order resonance .",
    "second , we have found that the acceptance area reaches its maximal value @xmath217 at @xmath218 , which roughly corresponds to @xmath219 in fact , @xmath220 is sufficiently large for a rather wide range of the values of @xmath65 .",
    "for instance , @xmath221 if @xmath222\\cup[1.079,2.037 ] \\cup [ 2.245,2.827].\\ ] ] third , we have studied @xmath59 and @xmath64 in the vicinity of resonant values . in particular , we have checked that @xmath223 at the third order resonance @xmath224 , whereas it reduces significantly , till @xmath225 , at the fourth order resonance @xmath226 other resonances do not lead to so sharp decreases of @xmath227 .",
    "this data is quite important because one of the criteria of choosing the design value of @xmath0 , or the working point of the machine , is to avoid values close to resonant ones .",
    "otherwise even a small natural drift of machine parameters may lead to @xmath0 approaching one of the dangerous resonant values and consequently to excessive beam losses . in this respect the asymptotic formulas  ( [ eq : asymptoticsaddlecenterbifurcation ] ) and  ( [ eq : asymptoticthirdorderresonace ] ) are of much interest .",
    "another important aspect of the acceptance structure are the elliptic islands and chaotic seas like the ones displayed in figs .",
    "[ fig : stabilityregioncolor_fourthorderresonance][fig : stabilityregioncolor_loworderresonances ] . for instance",
    ", each drastic change in @xmath227 is associated to the escape of a chain of elliptic islands from @xmath64 .",
    "the sizes of @xmath59 and @xmath64 along the @xmath47 and @xmath48 axes are also important for the beam matching . if the beam is previously bunched around @xmath0 then the bunch length in @xmath47 must be shorter than the corresponding size of the acceptance and the energy dispersion around @xmath228 measured in terms of @xmath48 see  ( [ eq : psi - w - defn]) must be smaller than its size in this variable .",
    "for example , let us consider the case @xmath229",
    ". then @xmath230 for @xmath231 , and @xmath232 for @xmath233 .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : fourthorderresonance ] .",
    "the bunches at the injection should fit these sizes in order to avoid beam losses during the acceleration ( in practice , to minimize beam losses ) .",
    "the latter means that @xmath234    small accelerators do not have buncher and the beam is produced by an electron gun which emits particles continuously , so they occupy the whole interval @xmath235 $ ] in the phase variable @xmath47 at the as entrance .",
    "our results provide an estimate of the beam capture efficiency @xmath174 ; that is , the fraction of the initial beam that is successfully accelerated . for @xmath229",
    "this fraction is @xmath236 the numerical computations show that @xmath237 for all @xmath65 in our rtm model",
    ". see remark  [ rem : phasedeviation ] in section  [ sec : mainresult ] .    here , we understand stability in a mathematical sense",
    ". that is , we are dealing with perpetual stability , although only @xmath238 turns were considered in our numerical computations of @xmath59 . on the contrary ,",
    "the number of turns made by each particle is typically of just a few tens in real rtms .",
    "for instance , the number of turns is roughly 90 in the rtm machine of the mami complex at the institute for nuclear physics in mainz , which is nowadays the largest rtm facility in operation  @xcite .",
    "thus , the physical acceptance and the true capture efficiency are larger than the mathematical stability domain and the estimates of @xmath174 given above , respectively .",
    "in fact , the difference may not be that large due to the instabilities of trajectories after just a few iterations .",
    "we have studied the case of the multiplicity increase factor @xmath43 , see section  [ sec : rtmmodel ] .",
    "the general case @xmath239 can be analyzed in a similar way , and the stability domains turn out to be smaller .    our detailed description of the acceptance is an essential widening and improvement of results reported in  @xcite .",
    "to the best of our knowledge our results give the first complete characterization of the stability domain of the full non - linear model of the beam longitudinal motion in rtms .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the obtained results show the importance of the non - linear effects in the rtm beam dynamics .",
    "this feature was well known from the experience of operation of this type of electron accelerators .",
    "many properties of the rtm map are similar to those of the hnon map .",
    "also , as it was pointed out in  @xcite , similar maps appear in the theory of anharmonic oscillator and optical theory of open resonators .    in our study",
    "we assumed that the acceleration gap is of zero length and that the velocity of particle is equal to the speed of light already at the injection .",
    "the latter is not the case for compact rtms with the injection from a standard electron gun",
    ". it would be useful to develop an approach in which these conditions are relaxed .",
    "a finite - size accelerating gap can be taken into account by introducing a transit - time factor  @xcite .",
    "the non - relativistic dynamics , which is of practical importance for the rtm design , can be considered by a corresponding modification of map  ( [ eq : f ] ) .",
    "the concept of generalized synchronous particle was introduced and phase oscillations and a corresponding map were studied in  @xcite . it was shown that the phase of the synchronous particles changes ( slips ) from turn to turn at the first orbits and this effect should be taken into account in choosing the phase of electrons at the injection .",
    "we have modeled the magnetic field in the rtm end magnets by a simplified hard - edge distribution , without taking into account neither the fringe field effect  @xcite nor more complicated field profiles  @xcite .",
    "studying the longitudinal dynamics in these cases is also of interest for the rtm beam physics .    finally , let us note that in our study the phase oscillations of particles of the beam were considered as independent of the transverse oscillations , vertical and horizontal .",
    "this approximation is valid if the amplitudes of these oscillations are small .",
    "a coupling between all three oscillations should be included in a more precise and detailed analysis .",
