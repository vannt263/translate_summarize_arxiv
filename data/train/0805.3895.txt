    "the two - body collisions are incorporated in the equations of motion only to the extend to which they contribute to the mean field . in principle , the time dependent hf approach treats the residual interactions exactly only if the mean field is allowed to break all symmetries .",
    "a such approach leads to a very big computational problem . in order to avoid such numerical difficulties ,",
    "usually , the hf mean field is constrained to be at least axial symmetric . in this case , levels characterized by the same good quantum numbers can not intersect . when the equations of motion are solved in such circumstances ,",
    "an individual single particle wave function will belong to only one orbital characterized by some good quantum numbers and the mechanism of level slippage @xcite is not allowed . in general ,",

    "the exchange between collective and internal degrees of freedom is neglected @xcite , so that adiabaticity is assumed .",
    "usually , these behavior leads to the unpleasant feature that a system , even moving infinitely slowly , could not end up in its ground state .",
    "some attempts were done to extend the time - dependent hf method in order to includes collision terms @xcite .",
    "this problem was partially solved by introducing a residual pairing interaction in the time dependent hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( tdhfb ) approach @xcite .",
    "this last method provides the possibility of level slippage for pairs and allows a description of the nuclear dynamics .",
    "for example , in the case of an even - even system , this method represents a tool to estimate the dissipation during disintegration processes @xcite . a connection with the landau - zener effect is included in the tdhfb equations .",
    "pairs undergo landau - zener transitions on virtual levels with coupling strengths given by the gap @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , for seniority one nuclear systems the pairing residual interaction does not affect a single nucleon and , during the deformation of the nucleus from its initial state up to scission , the unpaired particle remains located on the same orbital .",
    "the level slippage is again forbidden for the blocked level .    in the case of independent single - particles ,",
    "neglecting residual interactions , the problem of the unpaired nucleon is solved in terms of the landau - zener effect .",
    "the landau - zener effect reflects a mechanism that allows the possibility that a single nucleon skips from one single - particle level to another one in some avoided level crossing regions .",
    "the probabilities that the unpaired nucleon arrives in different final states can be computed by solving a system of coupled channel equations that characterizes the microscopic motion . in the following , a way to introduce a similar mechanism for the unpaired nucleon in superfluid systems",
    "is investigated .",
    "the tdhfb equations will be generalized in order to include the landau - zener effect .",
    "the classical tdhfb equations and the equations that govern the landau - zener effect will be obtained as particular cases of the new time dependent pairing equations .",

    "an effect analogous to the landau - zener one can be obtained by generalizing the tdhfb equations for the case of seniority one nuclear systems .",

    "whenever the upper limit @xmath10 is specified for a sum , it is implicitly assumed that the operation is realized on the @xmath10 possible diabatic states of the unpaired nucleon . in this paper ,",
