    "in this paper arguments will be given that there there are strong similarities in the infra - red physics of @xmath1 supersymmetric yang - mills and that of the quantum hall effect .",
    "a common feature of these two systems is the emergence of modular symmetry ( strictly a sub - group of the modular group ) in the infra - red regime . that the modular group may be relevant to the quantum hall effect",
    "was first suggested in @xcite , though the correct subgroup was only found later @xcite .    in the infra - red limit",
    "both theories can be parameterised by a complex parameter whose real part is the co - efficient of a topological term in the effective action describing the infra - red physics and whose imaginary part is essentially the co - efficient of the kinetic term , which must be positive . in @xmath1 susy the complex parameter is @xmath3 with @xmath2 the qcd vacuum parameter and @xmath4 the yang - mills coupling ( in units with @xmath5 ) , in the quantum hall effect the complex parameter is @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the hall conductivity and @xmath8 the ohmic conductivity . in both cases",
    "the complex parameter is constrained to lie in the upper - half complex plane for stability reasons .    in the low energy",
    "effective action for supersymmetric yang - mills @xmath2 is proportional to the co - efficient of the topological term @xmath9 and @xmath10 is proportional to the co - efficient of the kinetic @xmath11 term @xcite . in the low energy",
    "effective action for the electromagnetic field in quantum hall effect @xmath7 is proportional to the co - efficient of the chern - simons term and @xmath8 is related to the co - efficient of the effective kinetic term @xcite ( in a conducting medium the dielectric constant is the co - efficient of @xmath12 in the long wavelength effective action and has a simple pole at zero frequency , the ohmic conductivity is the residue of the pole ) .",
    "both systems have a hierarchy of phases : different strong coupling vacua of susy yang - mills on the one hand and different quantum hall plateaux on the other .",
    "these different phases are mapped into each other by the action of a sub - group of the modular group .",
    "there are also remarkable similarities between the scaling flow of the complex couplings in both systems and the main focus of this paper is to examine this relation .",
    "mathematically the link is the modular group .    in section 2 the scaling flow for @xmath1 susy yang - mills without matter",
    "is discussed and a flow of the effective complex coupling as the higgs vev is varied is constructed which is compatible with @xmath13 symmetry and reduces to the callan - symanzik @xmath14-function near the fixed points . the flow is a modification of the flow described in @xcite , that had singularities at strong coupling , and these singularities are avoided in the flow proposed here .",
    "striking similarities with the temperature flow of the conductivities of the quantum hall effect are described in section 3 , together with other parallels between these two systems .",
    "after the seminal results of seiberg and witten @xcite , in which the low energy effective action for @xmath1 supersymmetric yang - mills theory in 4-dimensions was explicitly constructed , scaling functions were derived explicitly for particular gauge groups and matter content in @xcite .",
    "the case of pure @xmath0 yang - mills was taken further in @xcite .",
    "the scaling function can be constructed in terms the complex coupling @xmath3 and the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field , or better the gauge invariant mass scale , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the higgs field in the adjoint of @xmath0 .",
    "a non - zero vacuum expectation value for @xmath16 gives the @xmath17-bosons a mass and breaks the gauge symmetry down to @xmath18 .",
    "the scaling function introduced in @xcite was essentially the logarithmic derivative of the seiberg - witten low energy effective coupling @xmath19 with respect to @xmath20 , @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are jacobi @xmath24-functions . in the definitions of @xcite @xmath25",

    "although ( [ betazero ] ) does take into account all non - perturbative effects , it is only valid in the weak - coupling regime and was criticized in @xcite since it is unphysical at strong coupling , giving a singularity at @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath35 also has an attractive fixed point at @xmath36 ( @xmath37 and its images under @xmath13 ) which arises because the flow is defined to be radially inwards towards the origin in the @xmath20-plane .",
    "we can change this and put the attractive fixed point anywhere in the finite @xmath20-plane , without affecting the behaviour at infinity , by defining a meromorphic scaling function @xmath38 from ( [ betazero ] ) it is straightforward to express ( [ betace ] ) as an explicit function of @xmath39 using elementary properties of @xmath24-functions ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "the effective coupling can be written in terms of elliptic integrals @xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind , @xmath42 with @xmath43 the qcd scale , @xmath44 with @xmath45 and @xmath46 is an integer ( @xmath39 is not uniquely determined by @xmath47 , rather @xmath48 ) . in terms of @xmath49",
    "the @xmath2-functions are @xmath50 since @xmath51 we obtain @xmath52 combining this with ( [ betazero ] ) gives @xmath53 with @xmath54 .",
    "the shift @xmath55 is equivalent to @xmath56 ( this follows from the property of jacobi @xmath24-functions , @xmath57 ) which in turn is a manifestation of the the @xmath58 action on the @xmath20-plane familiar from @xcite .",
    "since ( [ betac ] ) is not invariant under this shift when @xmath59 it is not a modular function of @xmath13 , rather it is a modular function of weight -2 for the smaller group @xmath60 .",

    "the flow generated by @xmath64 runs along the semi - circle spanning @xmath62 to @xmath34 , this semi - circle is the straight - line segment in the @xmath20-plane running between @xmath65 and @xmath66 and all its images under @xmath60 are also semi - circles in the upper - half @xmath39-plane .",
    "consider @xmath67 ( a similar analysis applies to @xmath63 ) , @xmath68 the resulting flow in the @xmath39-plane shown in figure 1 and is symmetric under translations in @xmath39 by 2 , @xmath69 .",
    "any starting value of @xmath39 at weak coupling @xmath70 with @xmath71 is driven to @xmath72 at strong coupling so consider the positive imaginary axis in the @xmath39-plane @xmath72 , where @xmath73 . in figure 2",

    "@xmath74 for the theory and its dual are mapped onto each other using the identity @xmath84 giving @xmath85 this therefore is a well behaved scaling function which is defined for both the the theory and its dual and gives the crossover between weak and strong coupling .",
    "it was suggested in @xcite that the zero of @xmath35 in equation ( [ betazero ] ) at @xmath36 was spurious and that a better scaling function would be @xmath86 where @xmath87 is a renormalisation factor with a pole at @xmath36 which accounts for the zero in @xmath35 .",
    "we see here that @xmath88 is indeed related to @xmath35 by a simple pole in the @xmath20 variable at @xmath36 .    near @xmath89 and",
    "@xmath90 the function @xmath74 behaves like a callan - symanzik @xmath14-function and this is the physical difference from the scaling function considered in @xcite . at weak coupling ,",
    "where @xmath89 , the gluinos have a mass @xmath91 proportional to the the vev of the higgs , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 so @xmath74 gives @xmath94 near @xmath95 , where @xmath90 , the dual higgs vev , @xmath96 , goes like @xmath97 and the monopole mass is @xmath98 so @xmath74 gives @xmath99 @xmath74 reduces to the callan - symanzik @xmath14-function close to the two dual points @xmath100 and @xmath34 , apart from an overall factor of @xmath101 at @xmath34 .",
    "away from these points its physical interpretation is not so clear .",
    "there is however still a pathology in @xmath74 since there is singularity at @xmath66 where @xmath62 .",
    "this can be avoided by using @xmath102 to describe the crossover from @xmath103 to @xmath66 and the discussion exactly parallels that for @xmath74 except that @xmath39 is replaced with @xmath104 or equivalently @xmath105 is replaced with @xmath106 .",
    "the flow is that of figure 1 with the horizontal axis displaced by one unit in either direction .",
    "any starting value @xmath107 at weak coupling is driven to @xmath108 at strong coupling .",
    "there is no holomorphic scaling function compatible with @xmath60 symmetry which has no singularities at all , since any modular function of weight -2 must have at least one singularity somewhere within , or on the boundary of , the fundamental domain  at best the scaling function is meromorphic .",
    "in fact one can do better and define a scaling function that gives the correct behaviour at all three singular points in the @xmath20-plane ( from now on we shall set @xmath109 so these singularities are at @xmath70 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 ) .",
    "we want to construct a scaling function that is meromorphic in @xmath20 and vanishes at both @xmath112 , without disturbing the behaviour @xmath113 at @xmath114 and this can be done using the ideas of ritz in @xcite . if we wish to avoid extraneous poles or zeros the only possibility is @xmath115 with @xmath116 and @xmath46 positive integers .",
    "demanding the correct asymptotic behaviour at @xmath117 requires @xmath118 so @xmath119 this flow is shown in figure 3 .",
    "the behaviour near @xmath34 is @xmath120 or , in terms of the dual coupling @xmath121 , @xmath122 as @xmath123 .",
    "this is twice @xmath124 as @xmath123 , because of the pre - factor @xmath125 as @xmath126 .",
    "it is therefore a factor of 4 greater than callan - symanzik @xmath14-function at this fixed point .    by construction ( [ betag02 ] )",
    "is symmetric under @xmath127 and so is a modular function for @xmath13 , just as @xmath35 was , but now there is a singularity at @xmath37 ( where @xmath128 ) corresponding to a repulsive fixed point , rather than the attractive fixed point of @xmath35 .",
    "there is an infinite hierarchy of crossovers near the real axis in figure 3 as a consequence of @xmath13 symmetry . under the action of an element @xmath129 of @xmath13 , @xmath130 ( with @xmath31",
    "even and @xmath33 ) the point @xmath100 is mapped to @xmath131 , @xmath34 to @xmath132 and @xmath62 to @xmath133 . as observed in @xcite , the infinite hierarchy of vacua at strong coupling",
    "can thus be classified into three types , in terms of @xmath13 these are : images of @xmath100 with @xmath134 , a rational number with even denominator ; images of @xmath34 with @xmath135 , a rational number with odd denominator and images of @xmath34 with @xmath136 again a rational number with odd denominator .",
    "the fermionic degrees of freedom at @xmath100 are gluinos with electric charge @xmath137 and magnetic charge @xmath138 , at @xmath34 they are monopoles with electric charge zero and magnetic charge @xmath137 while at @xmath62 they are dyons with electric charge @xmath139 and magnetic charge @xmath137 . in general , at a strong coupling fixed point , @xmath140 where @xmath141 is the electric charge and @xmath116 is the magnetic charge of the massless fermionic degrees of freedom , which are composite objects in terms of the relevant degrees of freedom at weak coupling .",
    "let us now look a little more closely at the flow structure generated by @xmath142 near the real axis in figure 3 . as @xmath20 varies between @xmath143 and @xmath137 , @xmath142 generates a semi - circle between two states on the real line , @xmath144 and @xmath145 ( we shall assume that @xmath146 and @xmath147 are mutually prime , similarly for @xmath148 and @xmath149 ) .",
    "this semi - circle can be obtained from the the positive imaginary axis in the @xmath39-plane , with end points @xmath150 and @xmath138 , by the action of some @xmath151 , with @xmath29 and @xmath32 odd and @xmath31 even .",
    "thus @xmath152 and @xmath153 , so @xmath154 is odd and @xmath155 even , @xmath156 is of undetermined parity while @xmath157 is odd . since @xmath33",
    "we see that @xmath158 and we have a selection rule for transitions between vacua in the strong coupling regime as @xmath20 is varied .",
    "the flow from @xmath111 to @xmath110 , which is the semi - circular arch spanning @xmath62 to @xmath34 in the @xmath39-plane , can not be obtained from the flow along the imaginary axis in the @xmath39-plane by using @xmath13 so we consider this separately .",
    "this semi - circle is mapped to another semi - circle linking @xmath159 to @xmath160 : that is linking @xmath161 ( so @xmath147 is odd ) to @xmath162 ( so @xmath149 is odd ) .",
    "again @xmath163 .",
    "this selection rule is related to the schwinger - zwanziger quantisation rule for a pair of dyons with charges @xmath164 and @xmath165 @xcite : @xmath166 with @xmath46 an integer",
    ". could be half - integral , but in pure susy yang - mills we are always dealing with @xmath18 charges coming from the adjoint representation of @xmath0 so it is integral in this case . ] writing @xmath167 and @xmath168 , with @xmath169 and @xmath170 integers , this is @xmath171 and the selection rule ( [ selectionrule ] ) dictates that flow always connects the nearest pairs allowed by the schwinger - zwanziger quantisation rule .",
    "the interpretation of the infinite hierarchy of states for n=2 susy yang - mills presented in the previous section is very similar to the hierarchy of states observed in the quantum hall effect ( a connection between @xmath1 susy yang - mills and the quantum hall effect was suggested in @xcite ) . for the quantum hall effect",
    "the complex coupling @xmath39 is replaced with a complex conductivity , @xmath172 , with @xmath7 the hall conductivity and @xmath8 the ohmic conductivity ( for an isotropic layer with @xmath173 ) . at hall plateaux ( where @xmath174 ) the hall conductivity is quantised , in units in which @xmath175 , as a rational number @xmath176 where @xmath116 is odd .",
    "these plateau are attractive fixed points of a scaling flow , even denominators being repulsive , @xcite .",
    "the suggestion in @xcite that the modular group might be relevant to the quantum hall effect was further developed in @xcite .",
    "indeed the group @xmath13 has an action known as the law of corresponding states  in the condensed matter literature @xcite , which holds under the assumption of well separated landau levels with completely spin polarised electrons ( when spin effects are important it was argued in @xcite that the @xmath13 symmetry is broken to @xmath60 ) .",
    "constraints on the scaling functions for the quantum hall effect , as a result of modular symmetry , were discussed in @xcite . if meromorphicity is assumed stronger statements can be made and a meromorphic flow diagram was presented in @xcite , which developed the original flow suggested in @xcite .",
    "this meromorphic flow is given by ) here . ]",
    "@xmath177 and is identical to figure 3 though the physical interpretation is different . for the quantum hall effect the flow lines are in the direction of increasing effective system size ( in practice",
    "this can be translated to decreasing temperature ) @xcite and different lines correspond to different values of the external magnetic field .",
    "as the temperature is lowered and the flow runs down from large @xmath8 , @xmath178 is driven onto a semi - circular arch in the complex @xmath178-plane , such as the semi - circle connecting @xmath179 to @xmath180 in figure 3 for example . on this semi - circle , there is a second order quantum phase transition , as @xmath181 , at @xmath182 . at or close to @xmath183 , @xmath178 becomes a function of a single scaling variable , @xmath184 , where @xmath185 is the deviation of the magnetic field from its critical value and @xmath186 a scaling exponent for the temperature @xcite . in this regime of very low temperatures",
    "@xmath7 runs between @xmath101 and @xmath187 as @xmath188 is varied at fixed @xmath189 .",
    "the picture is the same at all copies of the semi - circle under the action of @xmath13 , the exponent @xmath186 is believed to be the same for every transition , a phenomenon known as super - universality , and there is good experimental evidence that this is indeed the case @xcite ( the experimental situation is a little murky on this point however , in some experiments scaling appears to be violated at low temperatures @xcite ) . under the assumption of @xmath13 symmetry the critical points above the real axis are fixed points of @xmath13 which leaves the point invariant . ] and so their positions can easily be calculated for the crossover between any two given plateaux .",
    "the derivation of the @xmath13 flow in @xcite was made under the following assumptions : i ) in the long wavelength limit the flow should commute with the action of @xmath13 , in particular this implies that any point which is a fixed point of @xmath13 should also be a fixed point of the flow ; ii ) there are no fixed points of the flow that are not fixed points of @xmath13 ; iii ) the scaling functions are modular forms of weight -2 , in the sense of @xcite ( in particular they are meromorphic ) ; iv ) due to the stability of the quantum hall plateaux , the flow should approach the real axis at rational numbers with odd denominators ( attractive fixed points of the flow ) as fast as possible ; v ) the flow should be vertically downwards when the ohmic conductivity is large .",
    "assumption iii ) is an assumption about the analyticity properties of flow .",
    "mapping @xmath190 we have , under any variation @xmath191 of @xmath178 , @xmath192 since @xmath33 , so @xmath193 is automatically a modular function of weight @xmath26 if it is meromorphic .",
    "the general form of the flow does not depend crucially on assumption iii ) , provided i ) and ii ) hold small deformations away from meromorphicity can not change the topology of the flow or even the position of the fixed points  any such deformation would smoothly distort the lines of figure 3 but must leave the fixed points and the topology invariant .",
    "experimental flow diagrams are in remarkable agreement with the @xmath13 predictions : the flow diagram in @xcite found for the integer quantum hall effect is reproduced in figure 4 and that found in @xcite for the fractional effect in figure 5 .",
    "another consequence of @xmath13 symmetry for the quantum hall effect is the semi - circle law .",
    "semi - circles in the upper - half complex plane , spanning certain pairs of rational points on the real axis , are mapped into one another by the action of the modular group and so are rather special curves .",
    "experimentally the crossover between two plateaux , as the external magnetic field is varied at fixed low temperature , is often very close to a semi - circle @xcite . in the condensed matter literature",
    "this is known as the semi - circle law  and it can be interpreted as a consequence of @xmath13 symmetry . even without assuming any meromorphicity properties , just assuming that @xmath13 commutes with the flow and there is a symmetry between the pseudo - particles and the accompanying holes , the semi - circle law for the crossover between quantum hall plateaux can be derived @xcite .",
    "@xmath13 symmetry also implies a selection rule @xmath163 for transitions between quantum hall plateaux as the magnetic field is varied , @xcite .",
    "this rule is only expected to hold for two well formed plateaux with no hint of unresolved sub - structure between and is very well supported by experimental data on the quantum hall effect when this is the case , at least for quantum hall monolayers with the spins well split . to @xmath194 ,",
    "the spins are degenerate , which doubles the degrees of freedom in the lowest landau level and so doubles the conductivity @xcite . ]    the selection rule and the semi - circle law do not require any assumptions about the analytic properties of the flow  they only require that the action of @xmath13 commutes with it .    another similarity between @xmath1 susy yang - mills and the quantum hall effect is that , in the composite boson picture of the quantum hall effect described in @xcite , the effective degrees of freedom in a state with @xmath195 are electrons with @xmath116-units of magnetic flux attached with @xmath116 odd , that is the quasi - particles are composite objects with an odd number of vortices attached to fundamental charged particles .",
    "while , as a mathematical theory , @xmath1 susy has an infinite hierarchy of vacuum phases , the quantum hall effect , as a physical phenomenon , does not .",
    "experimentally there are limitations to the applicability of @xmath13 in any given sample and not all mathematically allowed phases will be seen . for very strong magnetic fields , with filling factors less than about @xmath196 , it is believed that the 2-dimensional electron gas will enter a new phase at @xmath183 , the wigner crystal , which is not part of the modular hierarchy , though factors as low as @xmath197 have been seen at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "in addition only fractions up to a maximum denominator , depending on the sample , will be seen  other physical factors , such as impurities , limit how far into the hierarchy one can penetrate .",
    "also if the temperature is too high the quantum hall effect is destroyed so there is a limit as to how high up into the complex conductivity plane one can trust the flow derived by assuming @xmath13 symmetry .",
    "it has been argued that scaling functions can be defined for @xmath1 supersymmetric yang - mills , without matter fields , which are modular forms of @xmath13 and which reduce to the correct callan - symanzik @xmath14-functions , both at strong and at weak coupling , up to a constant .",
    "the flow is shown in figure 3 and there is one singular fixed point in the fundamental domain , at @xmath36 , where the classical theory would have full @xmath0 gauge symmetry restored but the @xmath17 bosons remain massive in the quantum theory .",
    "not only does the quantum theory prevent the classical symmetry restoration , it actively avoids the point @xmath36 in both flow directions .",
    "massless dyons in the strong coupling regime have electric charge @xmath141 and magnetic charge @xmath116 with @xmath116 odd for attractive fixed points and @xmath116 even for repulsive fixed points ( in the flow direction in which the higgs mass is lowered ) and @xmath198 is a rational fraction as @xmath199 .",
    "exactly the same flow pattern has been predicted theoretically for the long wavelength physics of the quantum hall effect , on the basis of @xmath13 symmetry ( the law of corresponding states  ) and observed experimentally . in the quantum hall effect",
    "the parameter governing the flow is temperature and odd denominator plateaux are attractive fixed points while even denominator plateaux are repulsive .",
    "these states can be interpreted as being a due to bose - einstein condensation of pairs of composite fermions and are not part of the @xmath13 hierarchy . ]",
    "attractive fixed points give rise to quantised hall plateaux where the hall conductivity @xmath176 is rational with odd denominator .",
    "in both cases the effective degrees of freedom are composite objects in terms of the fundamental degrees of freedom  dyons in the case of susy yang - mills and composite fermions or composite bosons in the case of the quantum hall effect .",
    "composite bosons ( odd denominator states ) are charged particles carrying an odd number of magnetic vortices @xcite and composite fermions ( even denominator states ) carry an even number of magnetic vortices @xcite ( in both cases the underlying particles are still fermionic ) .",
    "it would seem that @xmath1 supersymmetric yang - mills in @xmath200 dimensions has much in common with the quantum hall effect in @xmath201 dimensions but exactly what the relation is , what are the essential features that are required to bring out modular symmetry in the effective action , is unclear at this stage , and there is scope for much work in the future to clarify this relation ( the modular group was also found to play a role in in other models @xcite and was considered in @xmath201 dimensional abelian chern - simons theory in @xcite ) .",
    "there is no suggestion here that supersymmetry is relevant to the quantum hall effect , rather it would appear that some minimal set of criteria is necessary for modular symmetry to emerge at long wavelengths ( general criteria for any system in @xmath201 dimensions were discussed in @xcite ) .",
    "supersymmetry is not essential , since nature has given us an experimental system which exhibits modular symmetry without it , and neither is lorentz invariance",
    ". the number of dimensions can be either 3 or 4 ( from the field theory point of view the quantum hall effect is a 3-dimensional phenomenon , since it occurs at very low temperatures ) .",
    "perhaps other dimensions are possible too .",
    "certainly topological effects are essential and effective degrees of freedom that are composite objects in terms the fundamental degrees of freedom and the topologically non - trivial degrees of freedom are common to both systems .",
