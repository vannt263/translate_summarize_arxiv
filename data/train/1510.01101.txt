    "the motion of deformable micron - sized objects though a viscous fluid represents an important problem with various applications , for example , for elastic microcapsules @xcite , red blood cells @xcite or vesicles moving in capillaries , deforming in shear flow , or sedimenting under gravity @xcite .",
    "another related system are droplets moving in a viscous fluid @xcite .",
    "motion of these deformable objects can be caused by external body forces , as in sedimentation under gravity or in a centrifuge , dragging the object through a quiescent fluid , or , in the absence of driving forces , by putting the object into a hydrodynamic flow , for example , capillary flow . in the context of microswimmers ,",
    "another possibility is self - propulsion of a soft microswimmer , for example , by fluid flows generated at its surface . on the micrometer scale , the hydrodynamic flows involved in the motion of these objects feature low reynolds numbers unless the particle velocities become very high .",
    "many elastic micron - sized objects , such as capsules , vesicles or red blood cells , are easily deformable because elasticity only stems from a thin elastic shell surrounding a liquid core . the analytical description and the simulation are challenging problems as the hydrodynamics of the fluid is coupled to the elastic deformation of the capsule or vesicle .",
    "it is important to recognise that this coupling is mutual : on the one hand , hydrodynamic forces deform a soft capsule , a vesicle , or a droplet . on the other hand",
    ", the deformed capsule , vesicle or droplet changes the boundary conditions for the fluid flow . as a result of this interplay ,",
    "the soft object deforms and takes on characteristic shapes ; eventually there are transitions between different shapes as a function of the driving force or flow velocity .",
    "such shape changes might have important consequences for applications or biological function , for example , if we consider red blood cells or microcapsule containers moving in narrow capillaries .",
    "shapes can also exhibit additional dynamic features such as tank - treading or tumbling , as it has been shown experimentally and theoretically for vesicles or elastic capsules in shear flows @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we investigate stationary shapes of elastic capsules sedimenting in an otherwise quiescent incompressible fluid , either by gravity or by the centrifugal force .",
    "possible shapes and the nature of dynamic transitions between them are only poorly understood for sedimenting capsules .",
    "an elastic capsule is a closed elastic shell , i.e. , a two - dimensional solid , which can support in - plane shear stresses and inhomogeneous stretching stresses with respect to their equilibrium configuration .",
    "this is different from a fluid vesicle , which is governed by bending elasticity only and is bounded by a two - dimensional fluid surface ( lipid membrane ) with vanishing shear modulus @xcite . whereas the rest shape of vesicles is determined by a few global parameters such as fixed area and spontaneous curvature @xcite ,",
    "elastic capsules can be produced with arbitrary rest shapes , in principle .",
    "we focus on elastic microcapsules with a spherical rest shape .",
    "we use this problem to introduce a method to calculate efficiently axisymmetric stationary capsules shapes , which iterates between a boundary integral method to solve the viscous flow problem for given capsule shape and capsule shape equations to calculate the capsule shape in a given fluid velocity field .",
    "the method does not capture the dynamic evolution of the capsule shape but converges to its stationary shape .",
    "the unifying concept of both the shape of an elastic capsule and the motion of a viscous fluid is _",

    "we stress the fact that @xmath6 is a field variable : there is a velocity for every point @xmath7 in the total volume , @xmath8 , and every time @xmath9 considered . for the change of momentum of a specific volume element that moves in time , we have to track its motion and compute the total time derivative of @xmath10 along the path of its motion @xcite , that is with @xmath11 , which is called the _ material derivative _",
    "@xmath12 there can be two types of force acting on the volume element , interfacial forces @xmath13 due to the interaction with neighbouring volume elements acting on the surface and body forces @xmath14 acting on the volume , and we can adapt newton s law to @xmath15    \\text{.}\\ ] ] we wrote @xmath16 with the surface normal @xmath17 , where we call @xmath18 the _ stress tensor _ , and applied stokes theorem in the last equality . because it holds for arbitrary @xmath8 ,",
    "the integrands are equal , which yields the _ cauchy momentum equation _ @xmath19 in the following , we consider this equation both for volume elements of fluid and for volume elements of the capsule membrane .",
    "for the fluid and for the capsule material there are different _ constitutive relations _ , which describe the relation between the stresses @xmath18 in the medium and the deformation state or velocity field ( stress - strain - relation ) .",
    "the left - hand side of this equation will be zero both for capsule and fluid , as we consider a stationary capsule shape ( @xmath20 ) and a stationary , incompressible ( or solenoid , if you will ) fluid flow at low reynolds number . in this stationary case , we obtain stress - balance equations for the fluid and the capsule shape .",
    "both equations are coupled : the fluid stresses enter the stress - balance for the capsule . moreover ,",
    "the fluid velocity field is required to be continuous at the boundary between capsule and fluid resulting in a _ no - slip boundary condition _ at the capsule surface .",
    "for the parametrisation of the capsule shape , we directly exploit the axisymmetry by working in cylindrical coordinates .",
    "the axis of symmetry is called @xmath21 , the distance to this axis @xmath22 and the polar angle @xmath23 .",
    "the shell is given by the generatrix @xmath24 which is parametrised in arc - length @xmath25 ( starting at the lower apex with @xmath26 and ending at the upper apex with @xmath27 ) .",
    "the unit tangent vector @xmath28 to the generatrix at @xmath24 defines an angle @xmath29 via @xmath30 , which can be used to quantify the orientation of a patch of the capsule relative to the axis of symmetry .",
    "the shape of a thin axisymmetric shell of thickness @xmath31 can be derived from non - linear shell theory @xcite .",
    "a known reference shape @xmath32 ( a subscript zero refers to a quantity of the reference shape ; @xmath33 $ ] is the arc length of the reference shape ) is deformed by hydrodynamic forces exerted by the viscous flow .",
    "each point @xmath34 is mapped onto a point @xmath35 in the deformed configuration , which induces meridional and circumferential stretches , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "the arc length element @xmath38 of the deformed configuration is @xmath39 .",
    "the shape of the deformed axisymmetric shell is given by the solution of a system of first - order differential equations , henceforth referred to as the shape equations .",
    "these describe stress - balance , i.e. , the balance forces and torques or tensions and bending moments acting on a patch of the shell , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : forces_slab ] . using the notation of refs .",
    "these can be written as    @xmath40    the additional quantities appearing in these shape equations are defined as follows : the angle @xmath41 is the slope angle between the tangent plane to the deformed shape and the @xmath22-axis , @xmath42 is the circumferential curvature , @xmath43 the meridional curvature ; @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the meridional and circumferential stresses , respectively ; @xmath46 and @xmath47 are bending moments ; @xmath48 is the transverse shear stress , @xmath49 the total normal pressure , @xmath50 the shear pressure , and @xmath51 the external stress couple .",
    "the first equation defines @xmath52 , the next three equations follow from geometry , and the last three ones express ( tangential and normal ) force and torque equilibrium . all quantities appearing on the right hand side of the shape equations have to be expressed in terms of the 7 quantities on the left hand side in order to close the equations .",
    "the curvatures and circumferential strains are known from geometrical relations @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 . the elastic tensions @xmath44 and @xmath45 and bending moments @xmath46 and @xmath47 , which define the elastic stresses in the shell material are related to the strains and curvatures by the material - specific _ constitutive relations _ , which relate the stress tensor in a material to the strain tensor and involve the elastic constants of the material .",
    "such constitutive relations often derive from an elastic energy functional , such that the stress tensor components are the first variation of the energy functional with respect to the corresponding strain tensor components @xcite .",
    "we will derive the general relation between stress tensor and elastic tensions and bending moments of the shell in the following section .",
    "below , we will focus on hookean capsules , where the constitutive relations derive from an elastic energy which is quadratic in stretching strains and bending strains .",

    "the constitutive relations for @xmath45 and @xmath47 are obtained by interchanging all indices @xmath25 and @xmath23 .",
    "the normal pressure @xmath64 the shear - pressure @xmath50 , and the stress couple @xmath65 are given externally by hydrodynamic and external forces . the static pressure @xmath66 is the pressure difference between the interior and exterior liquids . for the case of a capsule that is filled with an incompressible fluid its value is fixed by demanding a fixed enclosed volume .    the pressures @xmath67 and @xmath50 are the normal and tangential forces per area which are generated by the surrounding fluid",
    "for the latter it would usually be more natural to give express stresses in terms of their radial and axial contributions .",
    "the vector indicates that this only incorporates the hydrodynamic contributions .",
    "we do not consider cases with a static shear - pressure but , as is apparent from eq .",
    "( [ eq : p ] ) , there are static contributions to the normal pressure . ] @xmath68 where @xmath17 and @xmath28 are the normal and tangent unit vectors to the generatrix , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , equals the hydrodynamic surface force density vector @xmath71 which will be calculated below .",
    "re - decomposing @xmath72 into its normal and tangential components @xmath67 and @xmath50 we find @xmath73      in the following , we present a compact derivation of the shape equations ( [ eq : forceinplane ] ) , ( [ eq : torque ] ) and ( [ eq : forcenormal ] ) describing force and torque balance .",
    "we refer the reader to the literature @xcite for more elaborate derivations . from the cauchy momentum equation",
    "we gather that the equilibrium is given by @xmath74 .",
    "we will not use cartesian coordinates here , but curvilinear coordinates that are better suited to the capsule geometry . in the vicinity of the capsule we can parametrise space by the set of coordinates @xmath75 and @xmath76 which corresponds to a local tripod of orthogonal vectors is a three - dimensional normal vector of the axisymmetric surface , whereas @xmath17 is a two - dimensional normal vector to the generatrix @xmath24 . ] @xmath77 using index notation with @xmath78 ,",
    "the tripod vectors can be written as @xmath79 .",
    "we want to derive equations for the elasticity of a _ thin shell _ , which we treat as an effectively two - dimensional surface .",
    "this is done by restricting stresses to in - plane stresses and integrating over the normal direction ( the @xmath80-direction , @xmath81 $ ] with @xmath31 being the thickness ) .",
    "thus , it is advantageous to define a projector @xmath82 that projects the stress onto the subspace of in - plane stresses .",
    "we then have to compute the tensor derivative occurring in the in - plane stress - balance equation @xmath83 in these curvilinear coordinates .",
    "we can use the general result ( to be read with einstein summation convention ) @xmath84 with @xmath78 and the christoffel symbols of the second kind defined by @xmath85 .",
    "the christoffel symbols of the second kind are symmetric in the lower indices . for the non - vanishing symbols ( at @xmath86 , i.e.  on the surface , where we want to evaluate the stress ) we find @xmath87 here , we made use of the geometrical relations @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "from the given axisymmetry , we infer the following form of the projected stress tensor @xmath90 and computing the divergence ( at @xmath86 ) finally yields ( remember @xmath91 ) @xmath92 if we integrate over the small thickness and introduce ( the sign of @xmath48 might appear random and is such that the definition of @xmath48 agrees with the literature ) @xmath93 the in - plane stress - balance @xmath83 then establishes the shape equations ( [ eq : forceinplane ] ) and ( [ eq : forcenormal ] ) .",
    "the third equation ( [ eq : torque ] ) is obtained from considering the acting torque .",
    "a shell of finite thickness is able to sustain finite interfacial bending moments @xmath94 , which , in terms of basic physics , means that there is an additional contribution to the torque balance .",
    "arguing along the same lines as we did for the cauchy momentum equation but starting from newton s second law for rotational motion , @xmath95 yields ( in equilibrium ) @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the difference vector to the centre of mass of the patch .",
    "now we introduce the _ bending moment tensor _ ( also couple stress tensor ) @xmath98 by @xmath99 ( @xmath100 is the three - dimensional normal to the surface @xmath101 ) and the auxiliary tensor @xmath102 by @xmath103 ; after once again applying the divergence theorem we find , in absence of body forces , @xmath104 .",
    "we are interested in the axisymmetric case @xmath105 and ( after projection to in - plane stresses ) see that @xmath106 .",
    "we consider a small patch such that we can write @xmath107 and find after projection to in - plane - torques and using that the internal bending moments act along the directions of principal curvature , i.e. @xmath108 for @xmath86 @xmath109 which gives equation ( [ eq : torque ] ) after renaming @xmath110      the boundary conditions for a shape that is closed and has no kinks at its poles are @xmath111 and we can always choose which is absorbed into the static pressure @xmath66 . ] @xmath112 .",
    "if hydrodynamic drag and gravitational pull cancel each other in a stationary state , there is no remaining point force at the poles needed to ensure equilibrium and , thus , @xmath113 the shape equations have ( removable ) singularities at both poles ; therefore , a numerical solution has to start at both poles requiring @xmath114 boundary conditions ( @xmath115 at both poles ) out of which we know @xmath116 ( by eqs .   and and @xmath112 ) .",
    "the @xmath117 remaining parameters can be determined by a shooting method requiring that the solutions starting at @xmath118 and @xmath119 have to match continuously in the middle , which gives @xmath120 matching conditions ( @xmath121 ) .",
    "this gives an over - determined non - linear set of equations which we solve iteratively using linearizations .",
    "however , as in the static case @xcite , the existence of a solution to the resulting system of linear equations ( the matching conditions ) is ensured by the existence of a first integral ( see below ) of the shape equation . in principle , this first integral could be used to cancel out the matching condition for one parameter ( e.g.  @xmath48 ) , such that the system is not genuinely over - determined .",
    "we found the approach using an over - determined system to be better numerically tractable , where we ultimately used a multiple shooting method including several matching points between the poles .    using these boundary conditions",
    ", it is straightforward to see that the shape equations do not allow for a solution whose shape is the reference shape , unless there are no external loads ( @xmath122 ) .",
    "we make the following ansatz ( cf .",
    "( 17 ) , ( 22 ) in ref .  ) for a first integral of the shape equations @xmath123 we are also assuming that the pressure @xmath49 and the shear pressure @xmath50 can be written as functions of the arc length @xmath25 only .",
    "the calculation is rather straightforward , we differentiate and get @xmath124 in the second to last step most terms cancel each other out .",
    "thus , we arrive at an ordinary differential equation for @xmath125 , which we can integrate to find @xmath126 inspecting the behaviour at @xmath26 we deduce @xmath127 , which implies @xmath128 and , according to ( [ eq : us ] ) , @xmath129 .",
    "the physical interpretation of @xmath129 in ( [ eq : appx ] ) is that the capsule has to be in global force balance . by symmetry",
    "there can be no net force in radial direction , but the external forces can lead to net force in axial direction .",
    "the quantity @xmath125 contains the contribution to the net force in @xmath21-direction and thus a shape with the desired features ( namely @xmath130 at the apexes ) must have @xmath129 and , thus , be in global force balance .",
    "we want to calculate the flow field of a viscous incompressible fluid around an axisymmetric capsule of given fixed shape at low reynolds numbers . we chose to separate the problems , which allows us to state that for the calculation of the flow field the deformability of the capsule is not relevant , and the capsule can be viewed as a general immersed body of revolution @xmath131 . for the calculation of the capsule shape , which is addressed in the following section , and for the determination of its sedimenting velocity , we only need to calculate the surface forces onto the capsule which are generated by the fluid flow .",
    "we start with the fundamental notion that the mass of the fluid should be conserved under its flow @xmath6 giving rise to the _ continuity equation _ @xmath132 with @xmath133 being the local mass density .",

    "if there are multiple stationary solutions at a given gravitational strength the iterative procedure will obviously only find one .",
    "therefore one has to use continuation of solutions to other parameters ( different driving strength or bending modulus ) and possibly multiple initial flows to get closer to the full set of solutions .",
    "as an application of the outlined method that illustrates the interplay of elasticity and low reynolds - number hydrodynamics we consider the _ sedimentation _ of hookean capsules .",
    "sedimentation refers to the motion under the influence of gravity .",
    "however , an effective ( and several orders of magnitude stronger ) homogeneous body force can be created within a centrifuge .",
    "thus , on a more general level we consider an external stress field of the form @xmath210 . here , @xmath211 is the gravitational acceleration and @xmath212 the density difference between the fluids inside and outside the capsule .",
    "note that we measure the gravitational hydrostatic pressure @xmath213 relative to the lower apex , for which we chose @xmath112 .",
    "we consider a capsule filled with an incompressible liquid and we therefore determine the static pressure imposing a volume constraint .",
    "non - dimensionalising this system using the capsule s equilibrium radius @xmath214 and its elastic modulus @xmath57 , the remaining free parameter are the strength of the gravitational pull ( the _ bond number _ @xmath215 ) and the bending energy relative to the stretching energy ( the inverse _ fppl - von - krmn number _ @xmath216 ) .        a schematic diagram of the stationary shapes that are found in this two - dimensional control parameter space is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pd ] . from stokes solution for the flow around a sphere",
    "we see that the acting surface forces are @xmath217 .",
    "thus , the viscous drag tends to stretch the capsule . additionally the hydrostatic ( gravitational ) pressure effectively acts extensionally on the lower apex and compressional on the upper apex .",
    "this leads to a deformation towards pear shapes . for high bending rigidities the indentation of the flanks of the conical extension",
    "is suppressed by bending moments , leading to direct transition including shape hysteresis .    as in the static problem ,",
    "the capsule can release stretching stress through buckling at sufficiently high external stress .",
    "however , in this problem these buckled solutions are _ coexistent _ with the pseudospherical / pear - shaped solutions .",
    "we showed that the joint problem of an elastic capsule s motion in a viscous liquid at low reynolds numbers can be reduced to iteratively solving two essentially static sub - problems , the elastic shape problem for fixed hydrodynamic forces and the stationary hydrodynamic stokes flow problem for fixed boundary conditions from the capsule shape , if one is only interested in the stationary solution .",
    "we derived the relevant equations of motion and showed how to solve each the shape of an elastic capsule under a static external hydrodynamic stress and the flow field of a viscous liquid at low reynolds number around a rigid ( axisymmetric ) body .",
    "we then combined these two sub - problem solutions and closed the problem by demanding stationarity under iteration .    using this iterative method",
    ", we are able to resolve coexisting branches of stationary solutions in the problem of `` passively '' sedimenting elastic capsules .",
    "the method can also be adapted to `` actively '' swimming deformable objects .",
    "the most direct adaptation is possible for a deformable squirmer , where an elastic capsule with spherical rest shape generates a finite tangent slip velocity .",
    "this will change the boundary conditions of the viscous flow at the capsule surface from a no - slip boundary to a given tangential slip velocity ( in the capsule frame ) .",
    "it is also conceivable to treat even more complex problems , such as a diffusiophoretic deformable swimmer , where one eventually has to include the solution of an appropriate diffusion equation as a third coupled sub - problem into the iterative procedure .",
