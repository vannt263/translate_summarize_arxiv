    "the search for supersymmetric ( susy ) particles and the determination of their properties is one of the main goals of a future @xmath1 linear collider in the energy range between 500 gev and 1000 gev .",
    "particularly interesting will be the experimental study of charginos .",
    "they will be produced with comparably large cross sections and the analysis of their production and decay will allow to measure the parameters of the underlying supersymmetric model . in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )",
    "@xcite with conserved r parity the chargino masses and couplings are determined by the susy parameters @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the neutralino properties and thus the chargino decay into the lightest neutralino @xmath5 , which is assumed to be the lightest susy particle ( lsp ) , depend in addition on the gaugino mass parameter @xmath0 . recently",
    "a method has been proposed to separate the chargino production process from the chargino decay and to determine the susy parameters @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 independently of the neutralino sector @xcite .    besides the @xmath1 option also",
    "the @xmath6 mode of a linear collider can be realized with high luminosity polarized photon beams obtained by compton backscattering of laser pulses off the electron beam . in this contribution",
    "we study chargino pair production @xmath7 @xmath8 and for the case of the lighter charginos the subsequent leptonic decay @xmath9 .",
    "the chargino exchange in the t- and u - channel of the production process is determined by the electromagnetic coupling of the chargino and , apart from the chargino mass , completely independent of the susy parameters .",
    "therefore the combined process of production and decay allows to study the decay mechanism separated from the model independent production mechanism .",
    "the unpolarized production cross section for the charginos is not suppressed by destructive interference effects @xcite and larger than for chargino production in @xmath1 annihilation by a factor of 2.4 at @xmath10 gev and even by a factor of 9 at @xmath11 gev . by appropriate choice of the polarization of the photon beams it can be enhanced . as a further advantage the polarization of the chargino is solely determined by the polarization of the photon beams and can be modified by changing the polarization of the laser beam and the converted electron beam .",
    "the helicity amplitudes for the pure electromagnetic production process @xmath12 proceeding via chargino exchange in the t- and u - channel are denoted by @xmath13 . here",
    "@xmath14 are the helicities of the photons and @xmath15 the helicities of the charginos . the direct leptonic decay @xmath16 proceeds via @xmath17 and @xmath18 exchange with helicity amplitudes @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the amplitude squared of the combined process of production and decay is ( summed over chargino helicities ) @xmath21 it is composed of the ( unnormalized ) spin density production matrix @xmath22 which is , apart from the chargino mass , independent of the susy parameters , the decay matrices @xmath23 and the propagator @xmath24 . here",
    "@xmath25 and @xmath26 are the four - momentum squared , mass and width of @xmath27 . for this propagator",
    "we use the narrow width approximation .",
    "for further details of this spin formalism including full spin correlations between production and decay see @xcite .",
    "the production density matrix @xmath28 for polarized photons will be given in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the decay density matrix can be found in @xcite .",
    "the photon beams are produced by compton backscattering of circularly polarized laser photons off longitudinal polarized electrons .",
    "the energy spectrum and the mean helicity of the high energy photons sensitively depend on the polarization of the laserphotons and of the converted electrons and are given in @xcite . to obtain the cross sections and the angular distributions of the decay electrons in the laboratory frame ( ee - cms ) one has to convolute the cross section in the @xmath6-cms with the energy distribution and the mean helicity of the backscattered photon beams @xcite . in the next section",
    "we give numerical results for the production and subsequent leptonic decay @xmath9 of the lighter chargino and for the forward - backward asymmetry @xmath29 of the decay positron in the laboratory frame . in equ .",
    "( [ afb ] ) @xmath30 describes the angle between the decay positron and the converted electron beam .",
    "for the numerical analysis we fix the mssm parameters @xmath31 which lead to a gaugino - like lightest chargino @xmath32 with the mass @xmath33 gev .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show the energy dependence of the production cross section @xmath34 for different polarization configurations .",
    "the optimal polarization configuration depends on the beam energy . for @xmath35 gev",
    "one obtains the highest cross section for @xmath36 and @xmath37 , whereas for @xmath38 gev the configuration @xmath36 , @xmath39 is favoured .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the angular distribution of the positron from the leptonic decay @xmath9 is depicted for @xmath35 gev .",
    "it additionally depends on the susy parameter @xmath0 and on the masses of the sneutrino and the left selectron . as an example we have chosen @xmath40 gev and @xmath41 gev according to the gut relation @xmath42",
    "this corresponds to the desy / ecfa reference scenario for the linear collider @xcite .",
    "the mass of the left selectron is determined by the su(2@xmath43 relation @xcite @xmath44 for the polarization configuration @xmath36 , @xmath37 the positron angular distribution is forward - backward symmetric , whereas for @xmath36 and @xmath39 the backward direction is preferred with a rather large asymmetry @xmath45 .",
    "unpolarized beams lead to a vanishing forward - backward asymmetry .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows for @xmath35 gev and @xmath41 gev the @xmath46 dependence of the cross section @xmath47 for beam polarizations @xmath36 and @xmath39 . since the chargino production cross section @xmath48 is independent of the susy parameters fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] reflects the @xmath46 dependence of the leptonic branching ratio .",
    "the selectron mass is chosen according to equ .",
    "( [ su2 ] ) . fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows the corresponding forward - backward asymmetry of the decay positron . for @xmath49 gev",
    "the cross section shows a significant @xmath46 dependence whereas @xmath50 is sensitive to the sneutrino mass up to @xmath51 gev . since neither the cross section nor @xmath50 show ambiguities",
    "this process should allow to determine the sneutrino mass in the region @xmath52 gev . with increasing @xmath46 the contributions from @xmath18 and @xmath53 exchange to the chargino decay",
    "are more and more suppressed so that finally only the contribution from @xmath54 exchange survives .",
    "finally we give up the gut - relation between @xmath0 and @xmath2 and show for @xmath35 gev in figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] , respectively , the cross section and @xmath50 as a function of the gaugino mass parameter @xmath0 in the region 40 gev@xmath55 gev .",
    "the beam polarizations are again @xmath36 and @xmath39 . for the sneutrino mass we have chosen @xmath40 gev and",
    "the selectron mass is @xmath56 gev , corresponding to equ .",
    "( [ su2 ] ) .",
    "the decay @xmath9 proceeds via @xmath53 , @xmath18 and @xmath54 exchange so that the @xmath0 dependence of the cross section and of @xmath50 is determined by the interplay between the @xmath0 dependence of the lsp mass and the @xmath0 dependence and the relative magnitude of the relevant couplings .",
    "similar as for the @xmath46 dependence the @xmath0 dependence of the cross section reflects that of the leptonic branching ratio of the chargino decay . for large @xmath0 the mass of the lsp and the couplings are nearly independent of @xmath0 @xcite , leading to the flat run of the cross section and the forward - backward asymmetry . between @xmath57 gev and @xmath58",
    "gev the cross section increases approximately 10% and for @xmath59 gev it is nearly independent of @xmath0 .",
    "the forward - backward asymmetry , however , shows a pronounced @xmath0-dependence between @xmath57 gev and @xmath60 gev . since there are no ambiguities it should be possible to determine @xmath0 in this region from a measurement of the forward - backward asymmetry .",
    "we have studied the production of charginos at a 500 gev linear collider in the @xmath6 mode including the complete spin correlations between production and the subsequent leptonic decay . for @xmath61",
    "the cross section is strongly dependent on @xmath46 .",
    "the forward - backward asymmetry of the decay leptons shows a pronounced dependence on the gaugino mass parameter @xmath0 in the region 50 gev@xmath62 gev and on the sneutrino mass for @xmath52 gev .",
    "since neither the @xmath0 dependence nor the @xmath46 dependence of the cross section and the asymmetry show ambiguities , this process should allow to test the gut relation between @xmath0 and @xmath2 and to determine the sneutrino mass .",
