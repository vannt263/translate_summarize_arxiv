    "in principle , relationships between qsos euv continuum and the emission - line gas that it ionizes should give us clues to any relationship between accretion power and the physical conditions and kinematics of accreting or outflowing material within @xmath4 1 pc , hence clues to the mechanism of the central engine .",
    "several studies have shown that the soft x - ray spectrum is related to the emission line spectrum : steeper x - ray spectra are associated with stronger optical feii ( blr ) emission , narrower ( blr ) h@xmath2 , weaker [ oiii]@xmath15007 ( nlr ) emission ( boroson & green 1992 ; grupe 1996 ; grupe et al . 1998 ; forster 1995 ; laor et al .",
    "1994 , 1997 ; corbin 1993 ) .",
    "one of the greatest sources of variation from one spectrum to another can be represented as a linear combination of these observables  the so - called `` eigenvector 1 '' of principal component analyses .",
    "its underlying physical cause is unknown , but an understanding seems likely to hold a clue to accretion conditions , and to the energy budget problem  in particular the too - great strength of low - ionization emission lines such as feii ( netzer 1985 ) .",
    "laor et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have investigated the soft x - ray and h@xmath2[oiii]@xmath15007 region for a complete sample of all 23 qsos from the pg uv - excess survey ( schmidt & green 1983 ) with @xmath5 , and low galactic absorption ( n@xmath6@xmath7 ) , discovering strong eigenvector 1 relationships in this sample .",
    "the low redshift ensures detection of the soft x - ray emission down to the lowest possible rest frame energy ( typically 0.2  kev ) , which is redshifted into the unobservable soft x - ray region ( @xmath8 ) in higher redshift quasars . the low galactic absorbing column , and accurate 21  cm measurements of this column for all objects ,",
    "ensure small , accurate corrections for ultraviolet and soft x - ray absorption .",
    "this sample is ideal for extending this study into the ultraviolet , where the highest energy continuum and important uv diagnostic lines can be measured with minimal confusion from intergalactic absorption lines .",
    "thus we have obtained hst fos spectrophotometry from wavelengths below ly@xmath0 to beyond the atmospheric cut - off , and mcdonald observatory spectrophotometry from the atmospheric cut - off to beyond h@xmath0 .",
    "instrumental resolutions range from 230  350 km s@xmath9(fwhm ) . here",
    "we present highlights of a first look at our own and archival hst spectra and the x - ray and optical measurements presented by laor et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , and boroson & green ( 1992 ) .",
    "we have measured strengths , ratios and widths ( fwhm ) for the following emission lines : ly@xmath0 with nv@xmath11240 removed , civ@xmath11549 with niv@xmath11486 , heii@xmath11640 and [ oiii]@xmath11663 removed , and we have deblended siiii]@xmath11892 and ciii]@xmath11909 . in most cases it was possible to define a ` rest frame ' wavelength scale referred to [ oiii]@xmath15007 in our mcdonald spectra . generally feiii does not contribute much to the @xmath11909 blend .",
    "evidence for this is that the wavelength of the peak corresponds to within 0.5 - 1  rms of the expected wavelength of ciii]@xmath11909 .",
    "an exception is mkn 478 , where feiii is a clear contributor .",
    "the greatest uncertainties in line measurements arise from uncertainties in continuum placement , and in removal of associated and galactic interstellar absorption .",
    "details will be presented by wills et al .",
    "( 1998b ) .",
    "table 1 presents a few of the correlation results .",
    "eigenvector 1 observables , given in the first column , are correlated with important emission line parameters of the ultraviolet spectrum , given across the top of the table .",
    "eigenvector 1 variables are chosen so as to correlate positively with x - ray spectral index @xmath10 ( f@xmath11 ) .",
    "correlation coefficients are generally pearson coefficients using line ratios , and logarithms of equivalents widths and fwhms .",
    "spearman rank correlations give similar results .",
    "the two - tailed significance levels are given at the end of the table .",
    "we note that a large fraction of our observationally - independent parameters are correlated .",
    "this means that the significance of an individual correlation is not much affected by the fact that we attempted a large number of correlations .",
    "figure1 plots some of the correlations of table1 , the four columns representing eigenvector 1 observables : the steepness of the x - ray spectrum , the strength of feii ( optical ) , the strength of nlr emission ( [ oiii]@xmath15007 ) , and the width of the broad h@xmath2 line . in figure 2",

    "table 1 shows that line ratios involving civ strength , including the ew ( civ ) , correlate significantly with nearly all eigenvector 1 observables in the sense that civ strength anticorrelates with steep soft x - ray spectrum , and strong feii , and correlates positively with [ oiii ] strength and fwhm ( h@xmath2 ) .",
    "we note that correlations of ly@xmath0/civ and ew ( civ ) with @xmath10 are in the same sense as found by wang et al .",
    "( 1998 ) for a large , heterogeneous sample .",
    "our result suggests that eigenvector 1 is correlated with strengths of lines from low ionization transitions ( feii ) and anti - correlated with higher ionization transitions ( [ oiii ] , civ , ovi@xmath11034 ) .",
    "if investigation of species over a wider range of ionization confirms this , one possibile explanation may be along the lines hinted at by boroson & green ( 1992 ) , and investigated more quantitatively by brotherton ( 1996 , 1998 ) : the [ oiii ] may be produced by ionizing photons that reach the nlr after penetrating the blr .",
    "higher blr optical depths will result in stronger emission from lower ionization lines ( mgii@xmath12798 , feii ( optical ) ) , hence reducing the ionizing flux to the nlr beyond .",
    "a more highly ionized blr may produce stronger ovi@xmath11034 , civ@xmath11549 , and lower column densities of mg@xmath24 and fe@xmath24 , allowing greater ionizing flux to reach the nlr .",
    "for example , in a blr consisting of clouds with a distribution of optical depths , increasing ionizing flux could increase the ratio of optically thin to optically thick clouds .",
    "the ratio siiii]@xmath11892/ciii]@xmath11909 is strongly correlated with eigenvector 1 in the sense of a positive correlation with feii ( optical ) , and anticorrelations with [ oiii ] strength and fwhm ( h@xmath2 ) .",
    "it is also correlated with ly@xmath0/civ ( fig .",
    "2 ) . these correlations are stronger than the positive ( negative ) correlations of siiii ] strength ( ciii ] ) alone with feii / h@xmath2 and ly@xmath0/civ .",
    "the similar ( but not identical ) ionization potentials of si@xmath25  and c@xmath25  and photoionization models suggest that these ions are largely cospatial in the blr .",
    "this line ratio is sensitive to density , with n@xmath26  @xmath27  for the siiii]@xmath11892 upper level and n@xmath28  @xmath27  for ciii]@xmath11909 .",
    "thus eigenvector 1 appears strongly related to density , in the sense that the blr high density gas contributes most when feii ( optical ) is strongest .",
    "as found in other samples , fwhm ( ciii ] ) correlates well with fwhm h@xmath2 , suggesting that these are from the same kinematic region .",
    "similarly , there is a good correlation between fwhm ( ly@xmath0 ) and fwhm ( civ ) , but spanning a smaller range of fwhms .",
    "these correlations , together with weaker correlations of fwhm ly@xmath0  with fwhm ( ciii ] ) or fwhm h@xmath2 , and weaker correlations of fwhm ( civ ) with fwhm ( ciii ] ) or fwhm h@xmath2suggest different kinematic origins for low and high ionization gas .",
    "overall , we were somewhat amazed at the strong correlations present in our small sample , and conclude that small , but carefully - defined , homogeneous samples with high quality spectra can yield significant information on the underlying physics .",
    "we suggest that eigenvector 1 , in the sense of increasingly steep soft x - ray spectrum , increasing feii ( optical ) strength , decreasing nlr emission , and narrower ( blr ) h@xmath2 , represents increasing dominance of low - ionization gas , and high densities , as well as decreasing dominance of high - ionization emission .",
    "the interpretation of narrower h@xmath2  lines in terms of higher eddington ratios , and the correlation with steeper soft x - ray spectra , links the accretion process to density and ionization state of the surrounding gas ( wandel , laor , these proceedings ) .",
