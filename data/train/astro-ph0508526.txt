    "there are several theoretical and observational reasons for suggesting that the first stars ( `` population iii '' stars , hereafter popiii ) , which formed out of gas of primordial chemical composition , were more massive than today .",
    "we recall that the jeans mass , i.e. , the minimum mass necessary for a gas cloud to collapse under its self - gravity and give rise to a protostar , scales as @xmath5 , its effective dependence on temperature being steeper if turbulent phenomena are taken into account ( padoan et al . , 1997 ) .",
    "metals are the most effective coolants in gas clouds and they allow for the formation of small mass protostars ; in their absence , the cooling of the first stars was based on the rotational - vibrational transitions of molecular hydrogen .",
    "hydrodynamical simulations of the collapse and fragmentation of the primordial gas clouds suggest that the very first stars should have had masses larger than @xmath6 according to bromm et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , whereas abel et al .",
    "( 2002 ) give a mass range of @xmath7 .",
    "this high - mass biased star formation must have lasted until a certain critical metallicity @xmath8 was reached , at which point star formation switched to a low - mass dominated normal regime ( e.g. a scalo imf ) .",
    "the latest calculations constrain this value of @xmath8 in the range @xmath9 ( schneider et al . , 2002 ) .",
    "the imf may also depend on the ionization state of the gas and on the background of ionizing photons which could inhibit the formation of h@xmath10 and require even bigger halos for the creation of stars ( see e.g. haiman et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "being so massive , a popiii star should start its main sequence with cno burning , but since these nucleids were not present in the primordial gas , the star is forced to burn hydrogen via the @xmath11 chain , which is much less effective in counterbalancing the effect of gravity ; as a result , the star contracts more with respect to a normal popi / popii star , until it makes a trace of @xmath12c by 3-@xmath2 reaction , at which point it burns h via the cno cycle .",
    "such a more compact star evolves at a higher surface temperature , thus producing a great deal of ionizing photons .",
    "the compactness is also caused by the lower opacity due to the absence of metals .",
    "owing to the lack of metals in their envelope , popiii stars suffer from less mass loss during their lifetime if compared to massive popii and popi stars .",
    "this gives way , at the end of their lives , to a more probable formation of massive black holes and the so - called pair - creation supernovae , which leave no remnant after their explosion ( rakavy & shaviv , 1967 ; ober et al .",
    "1982 ) .    from an observational point of view",
    ", there are several cosmological and astrophysical problems which could be solved if one or more generations of massive metal - free stars existed .",
    "recently , the wmap experiment , by observing the large - angle polarization of the cmb , has provided constraints on the number of ionizing photons produced from either the first massive stars or agns at @xmath13 ( e.g. cen , 2003 ) .",
    "furthermore , the lyman-@xmath2 forest at @xmath14 , as seen in the qso light looks considerably metal - polluted ( schaye et al .",
    "2003 ) , suggesting an early stellar population which enriched the intergalactic medium via strong winds .",
    "the problems related to galactic chemical evolution which could be solved by the introduction of popiii are the pre - enrichment and the necessity of primary nitrogen in the early phases of the galaxy .",
    "in fact , no zero metal stars were ever observed in the galactic halo : the most metal poor star discovered so far ( frebel et al . , 2005 ) has @xmath15fe / h@xmath16 = -5.4 \\pm 0.2 $ ] .",
    "this may indicate that the first generation of stars in our galaxy , which enriched the gas out of which were born the population ii stars we observe today , were massive and died soon ( even though it can not be excluded that they were rare enough to be inadequately sampled by surveys so far ) .",
    "if this is the case , we could infer important constraints on their nucleosynthetic properties from the chemical abundances of the most metal - poor stars . as to n production",
    ", it is usually assumed that in massive stars nitrogen is a secondary element , i.e. , it is created from the seed nuclei of carbon during the cno cycle ; this implies that the abundance of nitrogen should decrease considerably towards lower metallicities .",
    "this is at variance with the most recent data of spite et al .",
    "( 2005 ) for n abundances in the galactic halo , which show a flat [ n / fe ] for [ fe / h]@xmath17 . in this respect",
    ", popiii stars could be good candidates for primary production of n from massive stars ( see also marigo et al .",
    ", 2003 ; meynet et al , 2003 ; heger et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "as far as @xmath2/fe ratios in very metal poor stars are concerned there is apparently no need to invoke popiii star nucleosynthesis ( e.g. franois et al .",
    "2004 ) , but since popiii star nucleosynthesis has been invoked to explain some peculiar behaviours of fe - peak elements ( mn , co , cr , ni , zn ) ( see umeda & nomoto 2002 , 2005 ) it is interesting to check the effect of popiii stars also on @xmath2-elements and fe .",
    "in particular , we aim at testing whether , in spite of the different @xmath2/fe ratios predicted for popiii stars relative to normal stars , the inclusion of these very massive objects in chemical evolution models can still be acceptable .",
    "in other words , we aim at investigating if the evolution in time of galactic chemical abundances can impose constraints on the characteristics and duration of the popiii phase .",
    "thus we have incorporated the nucleosynthetic products from popiii stars of @xmath2 elements , c , n and fe in a detailed chemical evolution model . to our knowledge",
    "this is the first test of this kind since the previous ones had only compared the observed abundance ratios in metal poor stars with the stellar production ratios .    in  2",
    "we describe this model ; in  3 we discuss the way we have modelled the popiii phase ; in  4 we show the results ; in  5 we briefly examine the effects of a variable imf similar to that proposed by larson ( 1998 ) ( namely , `` top - heavy '' at the earliest times ) and in  6 we draw conclusions .",
    "the model for the chemical evolution of the galaxy on which we based our investigation is essentially the two - infall model developed by chiappini et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , in which the two main components of the galaxy ( halo / thick disk and thin disk ) are supposed to be formed by two separate episodes of accretion of extragalactic gas of primordial chemical composition . during the first episode ,",
    "the halo is formed on a timescale of 1 gyr ; afterwards , the thin disk forms , with a timescale which is proportional to the galactocentric distance ( `` inside - out '' formation ) such that the timescale for the solar neighbourhood is about 7 gyr ( much longer than for the halo ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the present model does not refer to the hierarchical structure formation scenario , but it makes use of a backward approach , in the sense that we start from the present - time properties and try to derive the initial conditions which will lead to such properties .",
    "this approach is not in contradiction with the cosmological approach which starts from precise initial conditions , but is rather complementary . a comparison of the `` forward '' and `` backward '' scenarios can be , in fact , very useful .",
    "the reason why we do not adopt the forward approach here is that it still lacks sufficient numerical resolution to resolve single galaxies and contains large uncertainties on basic physical processes .",
    "however , we stress that computing galaxy evolution at high resolution and in a cosmological context will ultimately be successful . recently ,",
    "sommer - larsen et al . ( 2003 ) performed simulations of galaxy formation in a standard @xmath18cdm cosmology , including star formation and feedback effects and found that the gas infall rate onto the solar cylinder is exponentially declining with time , with an infall timescale comparable to that used in this model and obtained with the backward approach .",
    "moreover , the predictive power of models of chemical evolution , regarding abundances , gas fraction , supernova rates etc .",
    ", is still greater than that of models taking into account the hierarchical clustering paradigm .",
    "the star formation rate is parametrized as follows : @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 ; @xmath22 gyr@xmath23 is the star formation efficiency , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are respectively the surface gas density and the total surface mass density ( gas + stars + remnants ) , @xmath26 @xmath27pc@xmath28 is a threshold gas density below which star formation stops ( kennicutt , 1989 ) .",
    "the initial mass function ( imf ) has the following functional form : @xmath29 which closely resembles the one proposed , on observational grounds , by scalo ( 1986 ) , except that it has two slopes instead of three .",
    "stars do not form outside the mass range    the stellar yields were adopted as follows ( the choices below correspond to model  5 of chiappini et al .",
    "2003a , crm03 ) :    * _ low and intermediate mass stars _ ( @xmath30 ) : yields are taken from van den hoek & groenewegen ( 1997 ) as a function of initial metallicity .",
    "these stars produce he , @xmath12c , n and heavy @xmath31-elements . * _ massive stars _ ( @xmath32 ) : these stars give rise to type ii sne .",
    "their chemical yields are those from woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) for solar metallicity , extrapolated to the upper limit of the imf and found that above this mass a considerable reimplosion may occur with severely reduced yields and likely black hole formation .",
    "however , it was shown by franois et al . ( 2004 ) that if black hole formation occurs in this mass range it is impossible to fit the data at low metallicity ; therefore , since very few calculations are available in the mass range @xmath33 one has to perform an extrapolation .",
    "the models of woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) do not include mass loss , which is an acceptable assumption for pop iii stars but could be less realistic for later generations . ] ; they contribute to the enrichment in @xmath2-elements , some fe , @xmath34-elements and light @xmath31-elements . * _ type ia supernovae _",
    ": bearing in mind the w7 ( single degenerate ) model from nomoto et al .",
    "( 1984 ) , yields are taken from iwamoto et al .",
    "( 1999 ) which is an updated version of model w7 .",
    "these supernovae produce most fe and traces of light elements . *",
    "_ novae _ : nucleosynthesis from nova outbursts is included ( jos & hernanz , 1998 ) ; novae can contribute to the production of cno isotopes and li ( romano & matteucci , 2003 ) .",
    "this model reproduces well the observational constraints for the solar neighborhood , if we exclude n , overproduced by the yields of van den hoek and groenewegen ( 1997 ) for low and intermediate mass stars , and mg , underproduced by the yields of woosley and weaver ( 1995 ) for massive stars .",
    "the model also reproduces well the chemical evolution of abundance ratios as a function of [ fe / h ] for all elements , with the exception of nitrogen ( see franois et al .",
    "2004 ) ; in fact , since the production of nitrogen from massive stars is assumed to be secondary , that model predicts a steep decrease of @xmath15n / fe@xmath16 $ ] vs. @xmath15fe / h@xmath16 $ ] towards lower values of [ fe / h ] , at variance with the new data from spite et al .",
    "( 2005 ) which point towards a roughly constant and solar value for @xmath15n / fe@xmath16 $ ] at very low iron abundances .",
    "modelling the popiii phase requires the choice of a critical metallicity @xmath8 , below which the imf and the stellar yields are characteristic of metal - free stars . to do that , we need a functional form and a mass range for the imf and the adoption of zero metallicity stellar yields .    concerning the first point , we ran models with @xmath8 in the range @xmath35 ( the upper limit of this range is not realistic and has a merely investigative meaning ) .",
    "however , we are showing the results only for @xmath36 , since we saw no differences in the models with @xmath8 equal to @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "this can be understood if we bear in mind that it takes only a few supernovae to enrich the interstellar medium significantly , and as a matter of fact all of these critical metallicities correspond to a unique generation of popiii stars .",
    "we also ran models with a variety of mass ranges and imfs for the popiii phase , but hereafter we will present only models where low and intermediate mass stars were not included in the primordial imf .",
    "this primordial imf has the same form as in eq .",
    "[ eqimf ] , except that , the turning point being outside the considered mass range , there is a unique slope . in other words : @xmath40 where @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 depends on the considered nucleosynthesis , as we shall see next .",
    "when @xmath8 is reached , the imf switches to the one shown in eq .",
    "[ eqimf ] .",
    "the chemical evolution and nucleosynthesis of zero - metal massive stars have been computed since the early eighties ( ober et al .",

    "they also predicted a substantial mass loss during the main sequence phase , in contrast with all the other considered sets of yields .",
    "these calculations are old and likely to have been superceded by the most recent ones ; moreover , the lack of iron in their yields leads to a severe overestimation of the @xmath15el / fe@xmath16 $ ] ratios at low values of [ fe / h ] with respect to observations for @xmath2-elements and c ( see fig .

    "small discrepancies are seen in model f which tends to overestimate the surface mass density of stars , while model hfi strongly overestimates the present - day rate of supernova explosions .",

    "such a flat imf leads to an overproduction of supernova progenitors even at the present time .    in table",
    "[ tab : abb ] we show the calculated solar abundances by mass .",
    "if we exclude model hfi , all the predicted values are within a factor of 2 of the observed ones and thus acceptable ( with the exception of n ) .",

    "[ fig 8 ] shows the temporal evolution of the snia rate for model f ( the other models do not show remarkable differences relative to the basic model ) .",
    "we can see the pronounced peak during the halo phase which indicates that , because we chose @xmath68 as the `` most probable '' mass in the imf for the halo phase , the number of type ia sn progenitors , which are stars of intermediate mass , is increased by the adoption of this kind of imf .",
    "such a result also demonstrates how critically the results may depend on the details of the adopted imf : in fact , the imf being peaked near the intermediate mass range , the n production is enhanced for all models .",
    "the sharp feature in snia rate is not seen in models hfi and hfii , owing to the extremely limited time duration of the `` top - heavy '' phase which ends after 230  myr .    in fig . [",
    "fig 9 ] is shown the temporal evolution of the snii rate for all the models presented here .",

    "[ fig 10 ] shows the metallicity distribution of g - dwarfs in the solar neighbourhood predicted by these models ; model f and model hfi are not able to fit the data well , predicting an extremely sharp distribution peaked at too high [ fe / h ] . on the other hand",

    "depending on the particular chosen imf , there can also be different results in abundance evolution which largely depend on the adopted nucleosynthetic prescriptions .",

    "the problem of n has been discussed and in particular the fact that new data at low metallicity seem to suggest a primary origin for this element produced in massive stars .",
    "we have shown that rather than invoking n production from popiii stars , it is necessary to assume a continuous primary production from massive stars at all metallicities .",
    "such a production still needs to be understood , although recent stellar models with rotation ( meynet & maeder , 2002 ) predict some primary production of n in massive stars , although not enough to explain the data ( see chiappini et al .",

    "however , their analysis was based only on the direct comparison between element production ratios and abundances in very metal poor stars .",
    "* a continuously varying imf , favoring massive stars in the early stages of galactic evolution in the manner suggested by larson ( 1998 ) does not produce acceptable results either for the abundance ratios or the g - dwarf metallicity distribution .",
    "therefore , our conclusion is that a variable imf in general produces results at variance with observations unless the variation is so small as to be irrelevant .",
    "the same conclusion was reached by chiappini et al .",

    "this may explain why we do not see stars with zero - metallicity in the galactic halo , simply because the number of these stars must have been negligible , even though it can not be excluded that primordial stars formed in overdense regions and might have ended up in the galactic bulge ( where observations are more challenging ) instead than in the halo . in any case , even the standard model of crm03 with a normal imf including low mass stars predicts a fraction of stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath73 of the order of @xmath38 , in agreement with current estimates .",

    "<S> also the effects of a more strongly variable imf were discussed and to this purpose we have made use of suggestions appeared in the literature to explain the lack of metal - poor stars in the galactic halo with respect to model predictions . in these cases </S>",
    "<S> the predicted variations in the abundance ratios , the sn rates and the g - dwarf metallicity distribution are more dramatic and always in contrast with observations , so we have concluded that a constant or slightly varying imf remains the best solution . </S>",
    "<S> our main conclusion is that if very massive stars ever existed they must have formed only for a very short period of time ( until the halo gas reached the suggested threshold metallicity of @xmath3 for the formation of very massive objects ) ; in this case , their effects on the evolution of the elements studied here was negligible also in the early halo phases . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> we can not prove or disprove the existence of such stars on the basis of the available data on very metal poor stars . </S>",
    "<S> because of their large metal production and short lifetimes very massive primordial stars should have enriched the halo gas to the metallicity of the most metal poor stars known ( [ fe / h ] @xmath4 ) and beyond in only a few million years . </S>",
    "<S> this fact imposes constraints on the number of pair - creation supernovae : we find that a number from 2 to 20 of such sne occurred in our galaxy depending on the assumed stellar yields .    ,    galaxies : chemical abundances and evolution - stars : popiii , primordial nucleosynthesis </S>"
