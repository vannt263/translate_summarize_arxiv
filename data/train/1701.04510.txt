    "superfluidity is a quantum phenomenon found in various systems such as liquid helium , superconductors , atomic nuclei , and neutron stars .",
    "nuclear superfluidity is caused by pairing correlations , induced by the attractive effective interaction between pairs of nucleons .",
    "this leads to an odd - even staggering in nuclear masses and separation energies , and to a considerable reduction of the moments of inertia in rotational bands .",
    "these phenomena are observed throughout the entire periodic table  @xcite . in the past two decades , exotic nuclei with large proton or neutron excess",
    "have been extensively discussed and new phenomena have been discovered such as proton radioactivity close to the proton drip line or neutron halos in some nuclei at the neutron drip line .",
    "the coupling to the continuum plays an essential role in these weekly bound systems  @xcite .",
    "a famous case is the nucleus @xmath2li , where the first neutron halo has been observed  @xcite . without pairing correlations the two neutrons in the halo would not be bound to the @xmath3li core . in these nuclei close to the neutron drip line the fermi energy approaches",
    "the continuum threshold and pairing correlations make it possible for neutrons to occupy not only the weakly bound orbits but also unbound orbits with very low orbital angular momentum @xmath4 or @xmath5 near the fermi energy in the single - particle spectrum  @xcite .",
    "this could be most easily seen in the canonical basis , where the hfb wave function can be represented in the form of a bcs - state as it is discussed in detail in refs .",
    "their wave functions can extend far outside the nucleus due to the low centrifugal barrier , which is crucial to the formation of the halo structure  @xcite .",
    "of course , there is also the possibility to form a halo without pairing . if , for instance , the last occupied neutron orbit has an orbital angular momentum @xmath6 and a single - particle energy @xmath7 just below the continuum threshold , in the asymptotic region the dominant contribution to the hartree - fock ( hf ) density of this nucleus has the form @xmath8 with @xmath9 .",
    "the mean square neutron radius calculated with this density behaves as @xmath10 it diverges for @xmath11 .",
    "bennaceur _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that pairing correlations , leading to a finite pairing gap @xmath12 prevents such a divergence . the mean square radius calculated with the asymptotic hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) density behaves as @xmath13therefore",
    ", they concluded that the additional pairing binding energy acts against a development of an infinite root mean square ( rms ) radius that characterizes @xmath4 mean - field eigenfunctions in the limit of vanishing binding energy .",
    "this is then called ` pairing anti - halo effect ' .",
    "if one defines a ` halo ' by a divergence in the rms radius , this conclusion is definitely mathematically correct .",
    "however in nature we have to consider additional points : first , experimentally observed halos  tanihata1985_prl55 - 2676 have a large but finite rms radius ; second , apart from closed shells the coupling to the continuum causes and enhances pairing correlations",
    ". then the proper mean - field description of the nucleus is given by the hfb theory . in order to understand the structure of the hfb wave function",
    ", it would be useful to represent it as a bcs state in its canonical basis  @xcite , i.e. in terms of eigenstates of the density matrix , whose energies are defined as expectation values of the single - particle hamiltonian @xmath14 in the hfb equation . then one could find clearly that there are not only contributions to the radius from the canonical orbits below the continuum threshold of @xmath14 , but also from partially occupied states with energies in the continuum . for orbits without or with small centrifugal barriers ,",
    "i.e. for @xmath15- or @xmath16-levels their contributions are not negligible  @xcite .",
    "the coupling to those states definitely grows with increasing pairing correlations . if a halo could be formed only in cases without pairing , i.e. without coupling to the continuum , the three limiting conditions : zero pairing , @xmath17 , and low-@xmath1 values , would be actually difficult to meet in real nuclei due to the shell structure .",
    "neutron halo phenomena would be very rare and rather accidental among the known neutron drip - line nuclei .",
    "the influence of pairing correlations on single - particle configurations in the continuum has been studied in the literature  @xcite . however , these investigations were based on a fixed potential of woods - saxon shape and the spatial extension of the density was modified by changing artificially the depth of this potential .",
    "the continuum was taken into account by solving the hfb equation in a finite box of radius @xmath18 .",
    "it is the goal of this investigation to go a step further with respect to ref .",
    "@xcite and to clarify in a fully self - consistent way the influence of pairing correlations on the extension of neutron radii in these nuclei close to the drip line , as it has been observed in experiments ( as for instance in ref .",
    "it is certainly an interesting question to distinguish between the formation of a neutron skin or a neutron halo , as it has been done in several theoretical investigations  @xcite .",
    "however , it is not the goal of the present work to go into such details , as long as there are no precise experimental data available on the density distributions to distinguish these two phenomena . in the light of the above considerations",
    "it is evident , that the complicated interplay of the different phenomena of changing mean fields and pairing fields can only be achieved in fully self - consistent calculations with a proper treatment of the continuum .",
    "we will consider not only the influence of pairing on the asymptotic behavior of the wave functions of occupied , weakly bound , low-@xmath1 orbits , but also the role of the occupation probabilities introduced by the scattering of pairs around the fermi energy and the coupling to the continuum in these loosely bound superfluid systems .",
    "recently , covariant density functional theory has been used to study such phenomena with a discretized continuum  @xcite .",
    "since , worldwide , non - relativistic density functional theory is one of the most successful approaches in the description of exotic nuclei  bender2003_rmp75 - 121 we concentrate here on investigations based on density dependent hfb theory with skyrme forces . a recently developed code using the green s function method  belyaev1987_sjnp45 - 783,matsuo2001_npa696 - 371 allows us to avoid the discretization of the continuum and to solve the continuum hfb equations with the proper asymptotic behavior .",
    "technical details of this method can be found in ref .",

    "then increases as shown in fig .",
    "strong pairing correlations do not necessarily shrink the nuclear size as it is indicated by the word ` anti - halo ' .",

    "the asymptotic behavior of this wave function is sensitive to the pairing gap .",
    "finally , we would like to emphasize that the terminology ` pairing anti - halo effect ' has to be taken with great care . in the original literatures",

    "the expansion of the neutron rms radius by pairing seems to contradict to the so - called ` pairing anti - halo effect ' , which is associated with a reduction of the halo size by the pairing correlations .",

    "there exist ` halo ' orbits , i.e. weakly bound states and resonant states embedded in the continuum which , by themselves , have a large rms radius . without pairing they are unoccupied and",
    "can not contribute to the total radius .",
    "on the other hand the self - consistent solution of the corresponding hfb equations in the continuum leads to changes in the occupation pattern .",
    "this will lead to an increasing of the radius , which would not exist without pairing .    in the self - consistent calculation of our example nucleus @xmath0zr ,",
    "the above two aspects compete with each other and cause with increasing pairing strength the total neutron rms radius first to decrease and then to increase .",
    "the terminology ` pairing anti - halo effect ' only emphasizes the first aspect .",
    "therefore , this terminology is somehow misleading for this purpose .",
    "after all , ` halo ' is not equivalent to ` divergence ' , and pairing correlations play an important role in the anomalous increase of neutron radii in such nuclei .    the author y.z . would like to thank l.l .",

    "<S> the influence of pairing correlations on the neutron root mean square ( rms ) radius of nuclei is investigated in the framework of self - consistent skyrme hartree - fock - bogoliubov calculations . </S>",

    "<S> we find that , as the pairing strength increases , the neutron rms radius first shrinks , reaches a minimum and beyond this point it expands again . </S>",
    "<S> the shrinkage is due to the the so - called ` pairing anti - halo effect ' , i. e. due to the decreasing of the asymptotic density distribution with increasing pairing . </S>",
    "<S> however , in some cases , increasing pairing correlations can also lead to an expansion of the nucleus due to a growing occupation of so - called ` halo ' orbits , i.e. weakly bound states and resonances in the continuum with low-@xmath1 values . in this case , the neutron radii are extended just by the influence of pairing correlations , since these ` halo ' orbits can not be occupied without pairing . </S>",
