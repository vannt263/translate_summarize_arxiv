    "the understanding of thermal conductivity behavior @xmath0 is of direct interest to any research involving the discovery , design and development of materials for thermoelectric conversion applications , where @xmath0 should be as small as possible , while at the same time thermopower @xmath5 and electrical conductivity @xmath6 should be large . in the semiclassical theory for electron and phonon transport,@xcite several mechanisms",
    "are known as contributors to heat conduction / phonon scattering in a material , consequently affecting its overall thermal conductivity .    in metals ,",
    "heat conduction by charge carriers is the largest contribution , and is well described by the wiedemann - franz law @xmath7 , which directly relates the carrier thermal conductivity @xmath8 with an appropriate lorentz number @xmath9  w@xmath10/k@xmath11 , the electrical conductivity @xmath12 and the temperature @xmath13 . due to their typically large charge carrier densities @xmath14 ,",
    "metals have large @xmath15 and thus large @xmath8 in the range of @xmath16  w / m  k at room temperature .",
    "conversely , semi - metallic , semi - conducting and insulating compounds have low @xmath14 and @xmath6 , therefore small and often negligible @xmath17 and the overall heat conduction behavior @xmath0 near room temperature is in the range of @xmath18  w / m  k , governed mostly by contributions @xmath19 arising from the crystal lattice . at @xmath20 , @xmath21 from basic thermodynamic principles",
    ", so within the first few kelvins @xmath0 increases quickly as a power law @xmath22 , with @xmath23 depending on which phonon scattering mechanisms dominate at low temperatures",
    ". at higher temperatures the phonon scattering is generally described as governed mostly by umklapp processes , for which the debye approximation approach shows a decrease with a @xmath24 dependence .",
    "therefore , at some intermediate temperature usually around @xmath18  k , a characteristic `` crystalline peak '' is observed in @xmath0 for common compounds , due to the crossover from one regime to another.@xcite    the peak usually appears equally in polycrystalline materials since grain boundary scattering is in general a minor contribution,@xcite unless the average grain size becomes very small or the temperature very low .",
    "however , glasses are an exception to the above because of two basic factors : the very low mean free path for both electrons and phonons , and the presence of low - energy tunnelling states ( ts ) , i.e. , different localized potential minima for atomic positions in their amorphous distribution of nuclei.@xcite this class of materials shows extremely low heat conduction and a universal behavior of @xmath0 : the lowest temperature behavior ( up to @xmath25  k ) rises as @xmath26 due to scattering by the tunnelling states , then levels off as a characteristic intermediate temperature plateau ( attributed to rayleigh scattering ) . above @xmath27",
    "k it resumes a slow increase , until roughly levelling off again at higher temperatures .    in more recent years",
    ", the search for new and potentially useful thermoelectric materials@xcite has led to the discovery of compounds that not only have unusually low thermal conductivity , but whose general behavior resembles that of a glassy material despite the fact that they are true ( albeit disordered ) crystalline lattices.@xcite a prominent example is the intermetallic compound sr@xmath2ga@xmath3ge@xmath4 , with a filled type - i clathrate structure@xcite ( 6 larger @xmath28 cages forming tetrakaidecahedra plus 2 smaller @xmath29 cages forming dodecahedra , see fig .

    "a combination of phonon scattering by ts , resonant scattering on large , einstein - like localized vibration modes ( guest _ rattling _ ) and rayleigh scattering was used to adequately reproduce the experimental @xmath0 behavior ( henceforth we will refer to this combination as the trr model ) .",
    "later investigations amply demonstrated a splitting of the sr(2 ) site into four off - center positions,@xcite among which the ions could indeed tunnel .",
    "( color online ) the two cages of the type - i clathrate structure adopted by ba@xmath2ga@xmath3ge@xmath4 .",
    "if we consider the cage `` construction unit '' as 4 atoms connected in zig - zag from top to bottom , then the larger @xmath28 cage ( left ) is made of 6 such units and the smaller @xmath29 cage ( right ) is made of 5 units.,width=325 ]    as other clathrate compounds started being investigated , the trr model was challenged by at least two other models .",
    "one proposes that the tunnelling states are not required , only an _ off - center _ vibration of the guest ions,@xcite and another proposes that the guest ions do nt play a major role at all at low temperatures , but rather it is the phonon scattering on charge carriers that leads to the glasslike behavior.@xcite     ( color online ) irregular cage of the type - viii clathrate structure adopted by ba@xmath2ga@xmath3sn@xmath4 .",
    "the four smaller cage spheres represent the @xmath30 site , preferentially occupied by ga atoms.,width=226 ]    in this work we address the issue by performing single crystal x - ray diffraction ( scxrd ) , thermal conductivity @xmath0 and heat capacity @xmath1 experiments on ba@xmath2ga@xmath3sn@xmath4 ( bgs ) and ba@xmath2ga@xmath3ge@xmath4 ( bgg ) crystals , which have been tuned through the crystal growth process to display n - type or p - type majority charge carriers as a result of small imbalances in their ga : ge or ga : sn ratios.@xcite by analyzing the differences and similarities between the behaviors of these samples , we can test the applicability of the various models proposed to explain the origin of unusual glasslike behavior , in this case observed for p - type samples whereas the n - type samples show the normal crystalline peak .",
    "growth details of the batches used in this work are described in previous papers.@xcite single crystalline polyhedrons of 3 - 10 mm in diameter were obtained by a self - flux method .",
    "the carrier type is tuned by choosing ga or sn flux@xcite in the case of bgs or by adjusting the relative ge content in the initial mix with ga flux@xcite in the case of bgg .",
    "the batch name , flux composition and crystal composition determined by a jeol jxa-8200 electron - probe microanalyzer ( epma ) are summarized in table  [ epma ] .",
    "the composition values are averages over 10 regions of each crystal , although there are random fluctuations of up to @xmath31 throughout the crystals .",
    "the values shown for the p - bgg sample should be considered a correction to those published in refs . and , since this was a more careful evaluation made on the same batch .",
    "as expected from charge balance principles , ga - rich samples show p - type carriers while ge - rich samples show n - type carriers .",
    ".[epma ] average ba : ga : x content ( x = ge , sn ) in the four measured crystals as determined by electron - probe microanalysis . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     an interesting exercise can be made to help understand the influence of these different contributions in the trr model . if we begin with the fitting results for @xmath19 of the n - type samples , it is impossible to fit the respective p - type @xmath19 by increasing the intensity of only one of these contributions ( ts or resonant ) .",
    "the ts are mainly responsible for decreasing the low - temperature @xmath19 up to the first few kelvins , and by itself the ts contribution is incapable of changing the peak into a plateau .",
    "conversely , an increase in the resonant scattering level ( based on _ fixed _ values of @xmath32  k from heat capacity and increased phenomenological coupling strength parameters @xmath33 ) , readily brings the peak down to a plateau / dip , but quickly loses its ability to follow the @xmath19 drop below about 10  k. therefore , we may conclude that the trr model adequately reproduces the entire range of @xmath19 for all samples up to 100  k , provided that the coupling of the framework phonons with the guest ion tunnelling _ and _ rattling is increased in p - type samples .",
    "let us now focus on some other proposals regarding candidate mechanisms for glasslike behavior in clathrates , which challenge the trr model .",
    "first : is the presence of tunnelling states really necessary , or is _ off - center _ vibration a sufficient mechanism ?",
    "the question was raised by bridges and downward@xcite primarily based on the existing data at the time , where sr and eu guests clearly show off - center sites@xcite and glasslike @xmath0 , while ba guests appear to show _ on - center _ vibration@xcite ( within experimental resolution ) and a crystalline peak .",
    "later studies demonstrated glasslike behavior for p - type bgg@xcite and now for p - type bgs ( this work ) , so this argument by itself is no longer valid , unless a closer look at the ba vibration in these compounds through microscopic techniques shows that off - center vibration modes do exist for p - type samples ( even if much smaller than for sr and eu guests ) but not for n - type samples .",
    "raman scattering and exafs studies are presently being conducted on our carrier - tuned bgg crystals , which may help clarify this issue .",
    "still , good arguments were made by the authors in terms of describing how off - center vibration does indeed help enhance the _ coupling _ between guest vibration modes and the framework phonons.@xcite    a second challenge to the trr model is : can the shift from crystalline to glasslike behavior be explained solely by phonon scattering mechanisms within the framework , i.e. , by interactions between phonons and charge carriers ?",
    "this question was raised in a series of papers by bentien _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite which we now discuss .",
    "the first work@xcite called attention to an observed @xmath34 dependence at low - temperature for p - bgg and a kink in their data at about 2  k ( neither of which were reproduced with our crystals ) .",
    "they also pointed out that the phonon - charge carrier mechanism could not explain the lowering of @xmath19 above @xmath35  k , so the resonant scattering on the guest vibration was once again invoked , but to account for only the differences above 15  k. the second work@xcite compared several polycrystalline samples of type - viii and type - i eu@xmath2ga@xmath3ge@xmath4 ( @xmath36-egg and @xmath37-egg respectively,@xcite all with n - type carriers ) , clearly demonstrating that @xmath37-egg shows glasslike @xmath19 while @xmath36-egg does not .",
    "the difference was interpreted in terms of changes in the band structure , with a much enhanced effective mass @xmath38 found in @xmath37-egg .",
    "however , the cage sizes and shapes are also quite different between these two structures .",
    "the type - i @xmath28 cages are essentially the same size for all ge clathrates ( @xmath39   , see fig .  [ t1cages ] ) but the type - viii cage in @xmath36-egg ( @xmath40  @xmath41 ovoid similar to fig",
    ".  [ t8cage ] ) is significantly smaller than that of bgs , so any change in @xmath19 can also be argued or modelled in terms of changes in the eu vibration modes and their coupling to the framework . unfortunately @xmath36-egg samples with p - type carriers are as yet unavailable , but it would nt be surprising if they showed glasslike @xmath19 as we found in p - bgs .",
    "the third and more recent work@xcite shows results for ba@xmath2ni@xmath42ge@xmath43 similar to what we have obtained here for bgg and bgs , therefore the same analysis and discussion we have conducted here can also be applied to those results .    still , it is obvious that the influence of charge - carriers can not be neglected with respect to their density @xmath14 , effective mass @xmath38 , electronic mean free path @xmath44 , etc .",
    "it is quite clear from our measurements and all previously reported data on ba - filled clathrates , that the p - type carriers are playing a relevant role in producing an increased phonon scattering in these compounds , which we view as yet another additional factor capable of contributing to lower @xmath19 , possibly through direct interaction with the phonons , but especially by mediating an enhanced coupling of these with the guest vibration modes .",
    "a few brief examples for such mediation possibilities are : 1 ) n - type frameworks could allow a greater degree of _ coherence _ in the vibrations of neighboring ba guests than p - type frameworks , which would lead to larger mean free paths and less effective scattering ; 2 ) since the type and density of charge carriers result from stoichiometry imbalances , they may affect the framework rigidity at certain sites , and therefore how easily it can couple with the rattler ions .",
    "we have succeeded in growing large single crystals of ba@xmath2ga@xmath3sn@xmath4 and ba@xmath2ga@xmath3ge@xmath4 with both n - type and p - type majority carriers , and found that these compounds show low temperature lattice thermal conductivity behavior strongly dependent on the carrier type . a shift from crystalline to glasslike behavior",
    "is observed for both compounds when changing the majority carriers from n - type to p - type through composition tuning .",
    "these differences can be mostly reproduced by an increase in resonant scattering , however , an increase in both resonant and tunnelling scattering levels are required to reproduce the full set of data below 100 k. heat capacity and single - crystal x - ray diffraction data indicated that these increases are not the result of any major change in the guest ions vibrational behaviors , therefore a more effective coupling of the frameworks with p - type carriers to the ts and rattling vibrations of the guest ions is the most likely mechanism .",
    "the @xmath26 dependence in @xmath19 obtained at lowest temperatures for both n - type and p - type ba@xmath2ga@xmath3ge@xmath4 indicates that tunnelling states should be present for the ba(2 ) ions in this compound , therefore its mere presence is insufficient to guarantee glasslike @xmath19 .",
    "in fact , our results indicate that the various proposed mechanisms which may lead to glasslike behavior are all partially correct and at the same time incomplete . the general scenario that we see emerging",
    "can indeed be expressed as : _",
    "it s all about the coupling_. for reasons that still need to be explained microscopically , the n - type frameworks are more weakly coupled to the guest vibration modes than the p - type frameworks .",
    "thus , the ba ions smaller and ( almost ? ) on - center vibration is not coupled strongly enough to the n - type framework phonons to produce the glasslike behavior , but the p - type framework crosses the necessary coupling strength threshold to achieve this scattering regime . in contrast , sr and eu ions in the type - i ge clathrates have clearly off - center and larger rattling , capable of a strong enough coupling even with the n - type frameworks to produce glass - like behavior ( no p - type frameworks have been reported yet for these compounds ) . in a series of carefully tuned ba - based clathrates it should be possible to observe a continuous transition from glasslike to crystalline @xmath19 . likewise , in a series of n - type ( sr , eu)-based clathrates the same continuous transition should be observed not from carrier tuning , but from a physical or chemical reduction of cage size to dampen the off - center vibration level .",
