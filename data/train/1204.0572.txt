    "compact objects are one of the most fascinating entities known in our universe .",
    "these very particular astrophysical bodies ( white dwarfs , neutron stars , quark stars , hyperon stars , hybrid stars or / and magnetars ) seems to be relics of luminous stars which , in turn , are considered to be born from extreme events such as in supernova explosions .",
    "these objects are thought to have cores with densities higher than nuclear ( @xmath0 with @xmath1 ) and enormous gravitational binding energy ( @xmath2 ergs @xmath3 ) .",
    "the true equation of state that describes the properties of matter at such a high densities is essentially unknown @xcite-@xcite .",
    "currently , what is considered to be best understood in this active field , comes from the experimental insight and extrapolations from the ultra high energy accelerators and cosmic physics ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "having this uncertainty in mind , it seems reasonable to explore what is allowed by the laws of physics within the framework of the theory of general relativity .",

    "it was also found that these type of anisotropic configurations admit a conformal killing vector field ( see reference @xcite for details ) .",
    "it is clear that in equation ( [ globalst ] ) a collective behavior on the physical variables @xmath9 and @xmath10 is present .",
    "the radial pressure @xmath10 is not only a function of the energy density , @xmath11 at that point but also its functional throughout the rest of the configuration .",
    "the inner distribution of matters to a given point , and not only the density at that point , contributes to the value of the radial pressure .",
    "it is worth mentioning that there is no possible causality drawback with equation ( [ globalst ] ) because it is the static limit of equation ( [ global ] ) .",
    "when the evolution of a density perturbation is examined , the full dynamical equation ( [ global ] ) has to be considered .",
    "this type of equation of state , originally proposed by d. g. ravenhall and c. j. pethick in 1994 @xcite , has proven to be very fruitful describing a variety of relativistic astrophysical scenarios @xcite .",
    "particularly , in @xcite the authors , considering the framework of the non commutative geometry , describe a mini black hole having a schwarzschild geometry outside the event horizon , but whose standard central singularity is replaced by a self - gravitating droplet .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor of this droplet is an anisotropic fluid obeying a",
    "_ nles _ , which allows to have a droplet with a finite radius and positive definite pressure distribution at the interior .",
    "more recently , the concept of quasi - local variables was introduced which leads to a simplified criterion of stability of matter configurations based on the profiles mass @xmath12 vs radius @xmath13 @xcite .    in general relativity ,",
    "static spherically symmetric perfect fluid distributions are described by three independent einstein equations for four variables ( two metric functions , the energy density and the isotropic pressure ) . as in the case of classical hydrodynamics , in order to integrate the system , additional information has to be provided in the form of an equation of state or an heuristic assumption involving metric and/or physical variables .",
    "this situation suggests the possibility to obtain any possible solution by giving a single generating function , inspired in some physical intuitions .",
    "a method to procure solutions in this way has been recently presented by k. lake @xcite for local spherical isotropic fluid ( equal stressed along radial and tangential directions ) .",
    "this algorithm was extended by herrera and collaborators @xcite in order to consider anisotropic spherical distributions of matter .    in the literature",
    "there are several proposed strategies ( with a variety of heuristics ) to produce families of solutions having a parameter that generates new family - members ( see , for example @xcite ) .",
    "it is interesting to inquire about how the physical variables change as the parameter is altered and , more specifically , how the variation of the family - parameter affects the stability of the corresponding matter configuration .",
    "if the algorithm to generate new solutions leads to plausible models of compact objects and , as the family - parameter varies the family members become better models , thus the proposed method will have more physical meaning . in this work",
    "we shall investigate families of @xmath14 anisotropic matter configuration generated with the lake - herrera method by exploring the plausibility of their physical variables and by studying their potential stability when the parameter is changed .",
    "the structure of the present paper is the following . the next section sketches the method to generate families of exact solutions having _ nles_. in section [ examples ] we shall workout three examples of families of matter configuration having _",
    "nles_. we close the work with a brief discussion of the results in the section [ conclusion ] .",
    "in order to explore the feasibility of _ nles _ in the context of the lake - herrera method , we shall use an energy - momentum tensor represented by @xmath15 to describe static , spherically symmetric , anisotropic ( unequal stresses , i.e. @xmath16 ) bounded configurations in general relativity .    following @xcite , we can build a set of four independent scalars as : @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 . where @xmath21 is the einstein tensor , with a congruence of unit timelike vectors @xmath22 and its unit normal field @xmath23 satisfying @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "thus , with the above structure of the energy - momentum tensor , we have the following equations relating those scalars and the physical variables of the configuration : @xmath26    for the perfect fluid case , ( @xmath27 ) , we can write an equation involving only the above mentioned scalars : @xmath28    considering an static spherically symmetric space time , described by the line element @xmath29 if @xmath30 then , equation ( [ cfp2 ] ) can be written as @xmath31-r\\nu'\\left[r-3m+rm'\\right]-rm'+3m=0 \\,.\\ ] ] it is clear that for a given @xmath32 , the equation can be integrated to obtain @xmath33 , making it possible to build an algorithm to generate families of solutions of einstein equations in the case of perfect fluid @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath32 is not completely arbitrary because it must fulfill a series of requirements that prevent singularities on the invariants obtained from the riemann tensor .    for a perfect , static and spherically symmetric fluid , the fact that the central density @xmath34 and the central pressure @xmath35 are finite ensures that all the invariants of the riemann tensor , are regular at the center of symmetry .",
    "we wish to consider the feasibility of using a _ nles _ to obtain families of exact solutions of the einstein equations through the above mentioned algorithm and to explore the behavior of the physical variables as we vary the parameter that generates the members of the family .",
    "the metric corresponding to a static spherical matter configuration having a _ nles _ can be written as @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 is a constant @xcite .",
    "this metric recalls the so called isothermal coordinates system @xcite which , in turn , is a particular case of the more general `` warped space - time '' ( we refer the reader to @xcite and references cited therein for a general discussion ) .    with the metric ( [ metriest ] ) and the energy momentum tensor ( [ mnt ] ) , the einstein equations can be written as @xmath39 now , combining ( [ enl1est ] ) and ( [ enl2est ] ) it results that @xmath40    from the matching conditions , at the boundary of the distribution @xmath41 , we get : @xmath42 clearly , from equation ( [ globalst ] ) evaluated at the center of the matter distribution , it follows that @xmath43",

    "<S> we investigate the plausibility of some models emerging from an algorithm devised to generate a one - parameter family of interior solutions for the einstein equations . it is explored how their physical variables change as the family - parameter varies . </S>",
    "<S> the models studied correspond to anisotropic spherical matter configurations having a non local equation of state . </S>",
    "<S> this particular type of equation of state with no causality problems provides , at a given point , the radial pressure not only as a function of the density but as a functional of the enclosed matter distribution . </S>",
    "<S> we have found that there are several model - independent tendencies as the parameter increases : the equation of state tends to be stiffer and the total mass becomes half of its external radius . </S>",
    "<S> profiting from the concept of cracking of materials in general relativity , we obtain that those models become more stable as the family parameter increases . </S>"
