    "experiments in cooling and trapping of neutral gases have paved the way toward a new parameter regime of ionized gases , namely the regime of ultracold neutral plasmas ( unps ) .",
    "experimentally , unps are produced by photoionizing a cloud of laser - cooled atoms collected in a magneto - optical trap @xcite , with temperatures down to 10 @xmath0k . by tuning the frequency of the ionizing laser , initial electron kinetic energies of @xmath1",
    "have been achieved .",
    "the time evolution of several quantities characterizing the state of the plasma , such as the plasma density @xcite , the rate of expansion of the plasma cloud into the surrounding vacuum @xcite , the energy - resolved population of bound rydberg states formed through recombination @xcite , or electronic @xcite as well as ionic @xcite temperature have been measured using various plasma diagnostic methods .    despite the low typical densities of @xmath2 @xmath3",
    ", the very low initial temperatures suggest that these plasmas have been produced well within the strongly coupled regime , with coulomb coupling parameters up to @xmath4 for the electrons and even @xmath5 for the ions .",
    "thus , unps seem to offer a unique opportunity for a laboratory study of neutral plasmas where , depending on the initial electronic kinetic energy , either one component ( namely the ions ) or both components ( ions and electrons ) may be strongly coupled .",
    "moreover , the plasma is created in a completely uncorrelated state , i.e.  far away from thermodynamical equilibrium .",
    "the relaxation of a strongly correlated system towards equilibrium is an interesting topic in non - equilibrium thermodynamics and has been studied for decades .",
    "the history of this problem must be traced back to the important contributions of klimontovich @xcite , who pointed out that kinetic energy conserving collision integrals such as the boltzmann , landau and lenard - balescu collision integrals are not appropriate for such a situation , and derived non - markovian kinetic equations taking correctly into account total energy conservation of the system . in the following years",
    "this problem has attracted much attention and the relaxation of nonequilibrium strongly coupled plasmas has been studied by a variety of different methods @xcite .",
    "the very low densities of unps make it now possible to directly observe the dynamical development of spatial correlations , which may serve as the first experimental check of the present understanding of the strongly coupled plasma dynamics .",
    "moreover , it turns out that the timescale of the plasma expansion , the correlation time as well as the relaxation time of the ions are almost equal",
    ". therefore bogoliubov s functional hypothesis , usually used in kinetic theory , breaks down under the present conditions , which may lead to a very interesting relaxation behavior but also causes some difficulties in the theoretical description of these systems , since the plasma dynamics can not be divided into different relaxation stages .",
    "a full molecular dynamics simulation of ultracold neutral plasmas over experimentally relevant timescales is infeasible with present - day computer resources due to the large number of particles ( @xmath6 ) and the long observation times ( @xmath7 s ) involved . in order to model the evolution of unps",
    ", we have developed a hybrid molecular dynamics ( hmd ) approach which treats electrons and ions on different levels of sophistication , namely in a hydrodynamical approximation on the one hand ( for the electrons ) and on a full molecular dynamics level on the other hand ( for the ions ) @xcite .",
    "for the electrons , it has been shown that several heating effects , such as continuum threshold lowering @xcite , build - up of correlations @xcite , and , predominantly , three - body recombination @xcite rapidly increase the electronic temperature . as a consequence ,",
    "the electrons are always weakly coupled , @xmath8 , over the whole course of the system evolution . moreover , due to the small electron - to - ion mass ratio , the relaxation timescale of the electrons is much smaller than that of the ions as well as the timescale of the plasma expansion .",
    "hence , an adiabatic approximation may safely be applied , assuming instant equilibration of the electrons .",
    "this allows for the use of much larger timesteps than in a full md simulation since the electronic motion does not need to be resolved .",
    "it is this adiabatic approximation for the electrons which makes a molecular dynamics treatment of the ionic motion in unps computationally feasible .",
    "the electronic density is determined self - consistently from the poisson equation .",
    "the fact that the potential well created by the ions which is trapping the electrons has a finite depth is taken into account by using a king - type distribution @xcite known from simulations of globular clusters rather than a maxwell - boltzmann distribution for the electron velocities , with the electronic temperature @xmath9 obtained from energy conservation .",
    "the finite well depth also leads to evaporation of a fraction of the free electrons in the very early stage of the plasma evolution , which is accounted for by determining the fraction of trapped electrons from the results of @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the heavy particles is described in the framework of a chemical picture , where inelastic processes , namely three - body recombination and electron impact ionization , excitation and deexcitation , are taken into account on the basis of boltzmann - type collision integrals @xcite , with the transition rates taken from @xcite .",
    "numerically , the resulting collision integrals are evaluated using a monte carlo sampling as described in @xcite .",
    "the ions and recombined atoms are then propagated individually in a molecular dynamics simulation , taking into account the electronic mean - field potential and the full interaction potential of the remaining ions . in order to allow for larger particle numbers ,",
    "the most time - consuming part of the hmd simulation , namely the calculation of the interionic forces , is done using a treecode procedure originally designed for astrophysical problems @xcite , which scales like @xmath10 rather than @xmath11 with the number @xmath12 of ions .    as shown in several publications @xcite ,",
    "the hmd approach outlined above provides a powerful method for the description of unps , taking full account of ionic correlation effects .",
    "however , due to the large numerical effort involved , it is limited to particle numbers of @xmath13 . while this permits a direct simulation of many , particularly of the early , experiments , an increasing number of experiments",
    "is performed with larger particle numbers up to @xmath14 .",
    "thus , an alternative method which is able to treat such larger systems is desirable .",
    "such a method is indeed available @xcite , based on a hydrodynamical description of both electrons and ions similar to that introduced in @xcite .",
    "starting from the first equation of the bbgky hierarchy , one obtains the evolution equations for the one - particle distribution functions @xmath15 of the electrons and ions . neglecting again electron - electron as well as electron - ion correlations , and employing the same adiabatic approximation for the electrons already used in the hmd approach , a quasineutral approximation @xcite permits expressing the mean - field electrostatic potential in terms of the ionic density , leading to a closed equation for the ion distribution function which contains the electron temperature as a parameter .",
    "a gaussian ansatz for the ion distribution function , @xmath16 which corresponds to the initial state of the plasma cloud , is then inserted into the evolution equations for the second moments @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 of the ion distribution function . in this way ,",
    "evolution equations for the width @xmath20 of the cloud , the parameter @xmath21 of the hydrodynamical expansion velocity @xmath22 and the ionic temperature @xmath23 are obtained .",
    "ionic correlations are taken into account in an approximate way using a local density approximation together with a gradient expansion , reducing the description of their influence on the plasma dynamics to the evolution of a single macroscopic quantity , namely the correlation energy @xmath24 of a homogeneous plasma .",
    "the relaxation behavior of @xmath24 is modeled using a correlation - time approximation @xcite with a correlation time equal to the inverse of the ionic plasma frequency , @xmath25 , together with an analytical expression for the equilibrium value of @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "finally , inelastic processes such as three - body recombination and electron impact ionization , excitation and deexcitation are incorporated on the basis of rate equations , and the influence of the recombined rydberg atoms on the expansion dynamics is taken into account assuming equal hydrodynamical velocities for atoms and ions .",
    "the final set of evolution equations then reads    [ e2 ] @xmath26 \\nonumber\\\\&&+r_{\\rm{tbr}}(n)n_{\\rm{i}}-r_{\\rm{ion}}{(n)}{\\cal{n}}_{\\rm{a}}(n)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the electronic temperature is determined by energy conservation , @xmath27 \\left[k_{\\rm{b}}t_{\\rm{i}}+m_{\\rm{i}}\\gamma^2\\sigma^2\\right]+\\frac{2}{3 } n_{\\rm{i}}u_{\\rm{ii}}-\\frac{2}{3}\\sum_n{\\cal{n}}_{\\rm{a}}(n ) \\frac{{\\cal{r}}}{n^2}={\\rm{const.}}\\;,\\ ] ]    where @xmath28 defines the population of rydberg states , @xmath29 is the total number of atoms and @xmath30ev is the rydberg constant .",
    "the preceeding hydrodynamical method is much more approximate than the hmd approach , but , on the other hand , it is much simpler and quicker . for particle numbers of @xmath31 ,",
    "it requires about two orders of magnitude less cpu time .",
    "since its computational effort is independent of the number of particles , it allows for a simulation of larger plasma clouds corresponding to a number of current experiments .",
    "moreover , and maybe equally important , it provides physical insight into the plasma dynamics since it is based on a few simple evolution equations for the macroscopic observables characterizing the state of the plasma . as we have investigated in detail in @xcite",
    ", there is generally surprisingly good agreement between the hydrodynamical simulation and the more sophisticated hmd calculation as long as macroscopic , i.e.  spatially averaged , quantities such as electronic temperature , expansion velocity , ionic correlation energy etc.are considered .",
    "as an example , we show in figure [ f1 ] the time evolution of the electronic temperature for a plasma of 40000 sr ions with an initial average density of @xmath32@xmath3 and an initial electron kinetic energy of @xmath33k , obtained from the hmd simulation ( a ) and from eqs .",
    "( [ e2 ] ) ( b ) . during the whole system evolution ,",
    "the agreement between the two simulation methods is better than about 8% , and it becomes even better at later times .",
    "thus , we conclude that , for the present type of experimental setups , the hydrodynamical method outlined above , and in particular the approximate treatment of ionic correlations , is well suited for the description of the behavior of unps .",
    "in fact , fig .  [ f1 ] only shows good agreement between the two theoretical simulation methods , without comparison with experiment .",
    "such a comparison is now also possible , since measurements of the electron temperature dynamics have recently been reported in @xcite .",
    "[ f2 ] shows the time evolution of the electronic temperature for a xenon plasma with @xmath34 , @xmath35@xmath3 and two different initial temperatures of @xmath36k and @xmath37k .",
    "in addition to the full hydrodynamical simulation according to equations ( [ e2 ] ) , fig .",
    "[ f2 ] also shows corresponding calculations where the effect of inelastic electron - ion collisions , eq .",
    "( [ e2e ] ) , is neglected ( dashed lines ) .",
    "( the plasmas in these experiments are too large to be simulated using the hmd approach . )    for the high initial temperature , there is close agreement between the two corresponding simulations , showing that inelastic processes are almost negligible in this case .",
    "indeed , it is known that the high - temperature plasma expansion is well described by the collisionless plasma dynamics , and the hydrodynamical model is expected to accurately reproduce the plasma dynamics in this regime . since an overall systematic error of about @xmath38 for the temperature measurement has been reported in @xcite , we have exploited this fact to calibrate the measured temperatures by scaling down both experimental data sets by @xmath39 in order to match the high - temperature results to our calculations . as can be seen in the figure",
    ", there is excellent agreement between simulation and experiment also for the lower temperature .",
    "( we stress that there is no further scaling of the low - temperature data in order to achieve quantitative agreement , the same calibration factor as in the high - temperature case is used . ) in this case , inelastic collisions play a decisive role for the evolution of the system . more specifically ,",
    "as has been found already in @xcite , three - body recombination heats the plasma and significantly changes its behavior , leading to a weakly coupled electron gas , as discussed above in connection with the omission of electronic correlation effects in the numerical treatment .",
    "moreover , there has been some discussion in the literature whether the collision rates of @xcite would still be applicable at these ultralow temperatures , or whether three - body recombination would be significantly altered .",
    "the close agreement between the present simulation and the experimental data in fig.[f2 ] suggests that the rates of @xcite , while ultimately diverging @xmath40 for @xmath41 , still adequately describe three - body recombination processes in the temperature range under consideration .    as a second example , figure [ f3 ] shows the time evolution of the electronic density for a xenon plasma of @xmath42 ions with an initial average density of @xmath32@xmath3 and two different initial electron temperatures of @xmath43k and @xmath44k @xcite .",
    "again , it can be seen that the model equations nicely reproduce the density evolution in both temperature regimes , in agreement with @xcite where it was shown that the low - temperature enhancement of the expansion velocity @xcite is caused by recombination heating and is not due to strong - coupling effects of the electrons .",
    "having thus established the validity of our numerical methods for the description of unps , we can now turn to a more detailed investigation of the role of ionic correlations in these systems .",
    "it is found that , for situations corresponding to the type of experiments @xcite , they hardly influence the macroscopic expansion behavior of the plasma .",
    "this becomes evident , e.g. , in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , where the `` full '' simulations as described above ( solid lines ) are compared to a mean - field treatment of the system completely neglecting correlation effects ( dotted lines ) .",
    "the correlation - induced heating of the ions @xcite leads to a slightly faster expansion of the plasma , which in turn results in a slightly faster adiabatic cooling of the electrons @xcite .",
    "however , the overall effect is almost negligible .    a closer look , on the other hand , reveals that certain aspects of the expansion dynamics are indeed significantly affected by the strong ion - ion interaction , as can be seen in figure [ f4 ] . there , the spatial density of the ions is shown after @xmath45s for the same plasma as in fig.[f1 ] .",
    "a mean - field treatment of the particle interactions @xcite predicts that a shock front should form at the plasma edge , seen as the sharp spike in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] ( dotted line ) . apparently , with ionic correlations included ( solid line ) the peak structure is much less pronounced than in mean - field approximation .",
    "this is due to dissipation caused by ion - ion collisions which are fully taken into account in the hmd simulation .",
    "as shown in @xcite , by adding an ion viscosity term to the hydrodynamic equations of motion , dissipation tends to stabilize the ion density and prevents the occurrence of wavebreaking which was found to be responsible for the diverging ion density at the plasma edge in the case of a dissipationless plasma expansion .",
    "furthermore , the initial correlation heating of the ions largely increases the thermal ion velocities , leading to a broadening of the peak structure compared to the zero - temperature case .",
    "another obvious aspect where ionic correlations play a dominant role is the behavior of the ionic temperature . considering the huge ionic coupling constants suggested by the low initial ion temperatures , this temperature turns out to be an important quantity since it directly determines the value of @xmath46 . according to a mean - field treatment",
    ", the ions would remain the ( near ) zero temperature fluid they are initially .",
    "however , as has been pointed out before , the ions are created in a completely uncorrelated non - equilibrium state , and they quickly heat up through the build - up of correlations as the system relaxes toward thermodynamical equilibrium .",
    "as shown in @xcite , even at early times the ionic velocity distribution is locally well described by a maxwell distribution corresponding to a ( spatially ) local temperature , justifying the definition of a  due to the spherical symmetry of the plasma  radius - dependent ion temperature @xmath47 . moreover ,",
    "if the spatially averaged temperature is identified with the ion temperature determined by the model equations ( [ e2 ] ) one can find again good agreement between both approaches concerning the timescale of the initial heating as well as the magnitude of the ion temperature , even at later times @xcite .",
    "however , as becomes apparent from fig .",
    "[ f5 ] , the hmd simulations show temporal oscillations of the ionic temperature , which can , of course , not be described by the linear ansatz of the correlation - time approximation .",
    "such temporal oscillations of the temperature during the initial relaxation stage are known from molecular dynamics simulations of homogeneous one - component @xcite and two - component @xcite plasmas , which are clearly caused by the strongly coupled collective ion dynamics , since they increase in strength with increasing @xmath46 and disappear for @xmath48 @xcite .    despite the fact that the maximum initial coupling constant used in @xcite is @xmath49 , while a value of @xmath50 is considered in the case of fig .",
    "[ f5 ] , the oscillations observed in @xcite are much more pronounced and persist much longer than in the present case .",
    "it becomes apparent that the rapid damping of the temperature oscillations can be traced to the inhomogeneity of the gaussian density profile by looking at the central part of the plasma only , where the ionic density is approximately constant ( figure [ f6 ] ) .",
    "the temperature oscillations with an oscillation period of half of the inverse plasma frequency @xmath51 defined in the central plasma region are much more pronounced in this case , showing an exponential decay with a characteristic damping rate of @xmath52 ( fig.[f6](b ) ) . the temporally and spatially resolved temperature evolution shown in fig .",
    "[ f7 ] shows that the radially decreasing ion density leads to local temperature oscillations with radially increasing frequencies , thereby causing also spatial oscillations of the local ion temperature .",
    "therefore , the seemingly enhanced damping rate , which has also been observed in recent experiments , is purely an effect of the averaging of these local oscillations over the total plasma volume .",
    "the above considerations show that , while not dramatically affecting the overall expansion behavior of the plasma cloud , strong - coupling effects play an important role in different aspects of the evolution of unps .",
    "thus , unps provide a prime example of laboratory realizations of strongly nonideal plasmas .",
    "moreover , the hmd approach developed in @xcite is well suited for an accurate description of these systems over experimentally relevant timescales , allowing for direct comparison between experiment and theory .",
    "many interesting aspects of the relaxation behavior of these non - equilibrium plasmas may thus be studied in great detail . however , while effects of strong ionic coupling become apparent in unps , the naively expected regime with @xmath53 can not be reached with the current experimental setups .",
    "for the electrons , it is predominantly three - body recombination which heats them by several orders of magnitude , so that @xmath8 during the whole system evolution .",
    "the ionic component , on the other hand , is heated by the correlation - induced heating until @xmath54 , i.e.  just at the border of the strongly coupled regime @xcite . thus , it is the very build - up of ionic correlations one wishes to study that eventually shuts off the process and limits the amount of coupling achievable in these systems .",
    "as soon as the reason for this ionic heating became clear , several proposals have been made in order to avoid or at least reduce the effect , among them ( _ i _ ) using fermionic atoms cooled below the fermi temperature in the initial state , so that the fermi hole around each atom prevents the occurrence of small interatomic distances @xcite ; ( _ ii _ ) an intermediate step of exciting atoms into high rydberg states , so that the interatomic spacing is at least twice the radius of the corresponding rydberg state @xcite ; and ( _ iii _ ) the continuous laser - cooling of the plasma ions after their initial creation , so that the correlation heating is counterbalanced by the external cooling @xcite .",
    "we have simulated the latter scenario using the hmd method , extended to allow for the description of laser cooling , as well as elastic electron - ion collisions which are negligible for the free plasma expansion but not necessarily in the laser - cooled case @xcite .",
    "laser cooling is modeled by adding a langevin force @xmath55 to the ion equation of motion , where @xmath56 is the ion velocity , @xmath57 is a stochastic variable with @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and the cooling rate @xmath60 and the corresponding doppler temperature @xmath61 are determined by the properties of the cooling laser @xcite .",
    "elastic electron - ion collisions are taken into account on the basis of the corresponding boltzmann collision integral , which is again evaluated by a monte - carlo procedure @xcite .",
    "it is found that laser cooling leads to qualitative changes of the plasma dynamics . in particular",
    ", it significantly decelerates the expansion of the plasma , whose width is found to increase only as @xmath62 , in contrast to freely expanding plasmas which behave as @xmath63 .",
    "it is this drastic slow - down of the expansion which favors the development of strong ion correlations , compared to a free plasma where the expansion considerably disturbs the relaxation of the system .",
    "the simulations show further that strongly coupled expanding plasmas can indeed be created under realistic conditions , with ionic coupling constants far above the crystallization limit for homogeneous plasmas of @xmath64 @xcite . here",
    "we find , depending on the initial conditions , i.e.  ion number and initial electronic coulomb coupling parameter , strong liquid - like short - range correlations or even the onset of a radial crystallization of the ions .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ f8 ] , showing the radial density and a central slice of a plasma with @xmath65 , @xmath66 , cooled with a damping rate of @xmath67 , at a scaled time of @xmath68 .",
    "the formation of concentric shells in the center of the cloud is clearly visible . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f9 ] , beside the radial ordering there is also significant intra - shell ordering , namely a formation of hexagonal structures on the shells , which are , however , considerably disturbed by the curvature of the shells .",
    "in summary , we have used an hmd approach to study the behavior of ultracold neutral plasmas on long time scales .",
    "we have shown that effects of strong interionic coupling are indeed visible in such systems , e.g.  most prominently in the relaxation behavior of the ion temperature , which is connected with transient temporal as well as spatial oscillations .",
    "nevertheless , the strongly coupled regime of @xmath53 is not reached with the current experimental setups .",
    "we have demonstrated , however , that additional continuous laser cooling of the ions during the plasma evolution qualitatively changes the expansion behavior of the system and should allow for the coulomb crystallization of the plasma @xcite .",
    "it will be an interesting subject for further investigation to study in detail the dynamics of this crystallization process , which differs from the shell structure formation observed in trapped nonneutral plasmas @xcite as explained in @xcite .",
    "in particular , the influence of the plasma expansion , which presumably causes the transition from liquid - like short - range correlation to the radial ordering , deserves more detailed studies .",
    "other future directions include the study of effects induced by additional magnetic fields , or of ways to confine the plasma in a trap ."
