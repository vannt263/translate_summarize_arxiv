    "for instance , the helmholtz free energy @xmath72 , the internal energy @xmath73 , the entropy @xmath74 , and the specific heat @xmath75 , can directly be computed from the basic relations of thermodynamics and statistical physics such as @xmath76",
    "now , let us proceed to a discussion of the most interesting results obtained for the interacting spin - electron system on the doubly decorated 2d lattices . before doing this",

    "this observation would suggest that the critical temperature as well as other thermodynamic quantities remain unchanged under the sign change @xmath77 and thus , one may further consider the ferromagnetic interaction @xmath78 without loss of the generality .",

    "it is quite evident that the ground state will correspond to the lowest - energy eigenvalue of the bond hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) , which can be obtained from the eigenenergies ( [ eigen ] ) by considering four available configurations of the ising spins @xmath80 and @xmath81 explicitly involved therein .",

    "interestingly , one may also find a much simpler goniometric representation of the lowest - energy eigenstate @xmath83 by introducing the mixing angle @xmath84 through the definition @xmath85 , which yields for the particular case with @xmath78 @xcite @xmath86 |0 \\rangle .",
    "\\label{gsg } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] altogether , the four - sublattice quantum antiferromagnet @xmath83 can be characterized by a perfect nel order of the ising spins situated at the nodal sites of some loose - packed 2d lattice , while the mobile electrons delocalized over its decorating sites rest in the entangled state composed of two intrinsic antiferromagnetic states @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and , two non - magnetic ionic states @xmath89 , @xmath90 .",
    "the quantum entanglement of those four microstates arises from a virtual hopping process of the itinerant electrons , which is diagrammatically illustrated in fig .",
    "the respective probability distribution of the four entangled microstates is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] as a function of a relative strength of the hopping term .    the probability distribution for the four entangled microstates as a function of the ratio between the hopping term @xmath10 and the ising exchange constant @xmath11.,width=302 ]    the probability distribution for the four entangled microstates as a function of the ratio between the hopping term @xmath10 and the ising exchange constant @xmath11.,width=302 ]",
    "let us make a few comments on an origin of the remarkable four - sublattice quantum antiferromagnet emerging in @xmath83 .",
    "the hopping process of both itinerant electrons energetically favors their antiparallel spin alignment and this antiferromagnetic correlation is subsequently mediated through the ising - type exchange interaction @xmath11 also on their two nearest - neighbor ising spins ( hence , the antiferromagnetic character of the effective interaction @xmath51 between the ising spins ) .",
    "if a relative strength of the hopping term is sufficiently weak , the ising spins prefer the ferromagnetic alignment with respect to their nearest - neighbor mobile electrons as it can be clearly seen from the occurrence probability of the majority microstate @xmath87 that converges to @xmath91 in the limit @xmath92 .",
    "it is nevertheless worth mentioning that the occurrence probabilities of three minority microstates monotonically increase upon strengthening the hopping term at the expense of the occurrence probability of the majority microstate until they asymptotically reach the same value @xmath93 in the limit @xmath94 .",
    "next , let us examine critical phenomena associated with finite - temperature phase transitions of the spontaneously long - range ordered phase @xmath83 .",
    "it is worthwhile to recall that the critical temperature can easily be obtained by solving numerically the critical conditions derived in the foregoing section .",
    "the finite - temperature phase diagram in the form of the critical temperature versus the kinetic term dependence is shown in fig .  [ fig4 ] for the interacting spin - electron system on doubly decorated square and honeycomb lattices .",
    "it is quite obvious from this figure that the interacting spin - electron system on any loose - packed doubly decorated 2d lattice exhibits the same general trends in the relevant dependences of the critical temperature .",
    "the critical temperature initially exhibits a relatively rapid increase from zero temperature with increasing the ratio between the hopping term @xmath10 and the exchange constant @xmath11        until it achieves its maximum value .",
    "the critical temperature then gradually decreases upon further increase of a relative strength of the kinetic energy before it again tends to zero temperature in the other particular limit @xmath94 . in the limit @xmath92",
    ", the observed zero critical temperature can be attributed to a localization of the itinerant electrons at particular decorating sites .",
    "in fact , there does not exist any other interaction between the itinerant electrons within the tight - binding model described by the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) except the effective interaction originating from their virtual hopping process .",
    "if the hopping process of the itinerant electrons is ignored , the interacting spin - electron system then effectively splits into independent fragments each of them having one central ising spin coupled to the @xmath20 localized electrons from its nearest - neighbor decorating sites . in the other particular",
    "limit @xmath94 , the zero critical temperature results from the same probabilities of the four entangled microstates of @xmath83 as it has been already discussed by the ground - state analysis .",
    "owing to this fact , the decorating sites occupied by the mobile electrons have non - magnetic character , which is compatible with a disappearance of the effective interaction @xmath95 between the localized ising spins that occurs in the particular limit @xmath94 .",
    "temperature variations of both sublattice staggered magnetizations @xmath96 and @xmath97 are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] for three different values of a relative strength of the kinetic energy .",
    "the most obvious difference between the sublattice staggered magnetizations @xmath96 and @xmath97 pertinent to the ising spins and itinerant electrons , respectively , lies in the quantum reduction of the latter staggered magnetization",
    ". the greater a relative strength of the hopping term is , the greater quantum reduction of the staggered magnetization @xmath97 can be observed in fig .",

    "[ fig6 ] for the interacting spin - electron system on the doubly decorated square lattice at three different relative strengths of the kinetic term @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 .",
    "it is quite evident that the investigated model system exhibits the familiar logarithmic singularity at critical temperature of the order - disorder transition , which provides another independent confirmation of the critical behavior from the standard ising universality class .    , @xmath103 , and @xmath104.,width=302 ]    in addition to the logarithmic divergence observed in a close vicinity of the critical point",
    ", the specific heat also displays a round schottky - type maximum in the high - temperature tail of the specific heat curve .",
    "this maximum is well separated from the logarithmic singularity at relatively weak hopping terms ( see solid line for @xmath102 ) , while it becomes superimposed on a logarithmic divergence at moderate strengths of the kinetic term ( see dotted line for @xmath105 ) .",
    "last but not least , the round high - temperature maximum again separates from the logarithmic singularity upon further increase of a relative strength of the hopping term .",
    "the round maximum then shifts towards higher temperatures and it becomes the broader , the stronger a relative strength of the kinetic term is ( see dashed line for @xmath106 ) .",
    "in this article , the hybrid lattice - statistical model of the interacting spin - electron system on doubly decorated 2d lattices has exactly been solved by the use of generalized decoration - iteration transformation under the constraint of a half - filling of each couple of the decorating sites .",
    "it has been shown that the ground state of the investigated model system defined on any doubly decorated loose - packed 2d lattice represents an interesting four - sublattice quantum antiferromagnetic phase .",
    "it is worth noticing , moreover , that this four - sublattice quantum antiferromagnet exhibits a remarkable combination of the spontaneous long - range order manifested through a non - trivial criticality at non - zero temperatures with obvious macroscopic features of quantum origin such as the quantum reduction of the staggered magnetization pertinent to the itinerant electrons . to the best of our knowledge ,",
