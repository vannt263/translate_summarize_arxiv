    "the observed neutrino oscillation@xcite implies strong lepton flavor violation(lfv ) . in the standard model(sm )",
    ", lepton number is exactly preserved in contradiction with the neutrino oscillation .",
    "some shortcomings of sm , for instance , the emergence of quadratic divergences in the higgs sector , imply that the sm need to be extended . the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm)@xcite is one of the most promising candidates in all extensions of the sm .",
    "the most general superpotential in supersymmetry theory contains bilinear and trilinear terms which do not conserve either the baryon number ( b ) or the lepton number ( l ) .",
    "the simultaneous presence of both lepton number violating and baryon number violating could lead to very rapid proton decay . in order to turn off proton rapid decay ,",
    "supersymmetric models introduce a discrete r - parity symmetry@xcite implying a conserved quantum number @xmath5 , where b , l and s are the baryon number , the lepton number and the spin of particles respectively .",
    "however , such a stringent symmetry appears short of theoretical basis .",
    "especially we know that a stable proton can survive by imposing only one of l- and b- conservation",
    ". moreover , non - zero r - violating couplings might provide small neutrino masses , which would explain the phenomena of neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "thus , there is strong theoretical and phenomenological motivation to introduce partial r - parity violations into the most general representations of superpotential , which can be written as @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 = 1,2,3 are generation indices ; @xmath8 = 1,2 are su(2 ) isospin indices and @xmath9 are su(3 ) color indices .",
    "@xmath10 are dimensionless r - violating yukawa couplings behaving as @xmath11 , @xmath12 . in above superpotential , the last bilinear terms mix the lepton superfield and the higgs one , which might generate masses of neutrinos and consequently introduce compatible description of neutrino oscillation in a natural way@xcite .",
    "all the other trilinear terms only violate either l- or b - symmetry respectively , and the terms that may produce both l- and b - violation simultaneously are forbidden in superpotential so that a stable proton is ensured .    experimental detection on the signals of r - parity violating interactions would be the most outstanding evidence of new physics beyond the sm .",
    "if nature is supersymmetric and neutrino oscillations are really induced by r - violating couplings included in a general superpotential , then the prediction of single sneutrino production modes at colliders is straightforward .",
    "therefore , probing single sneutrino production on a high energy collider is specially attractive in experimental searches and relevant phenomenological studies about r - violating interactions .",
    "such exploration ought to be promising if carried out on fine high energy lepton colliders .",
    "there were some experimental bounds on lfv di - lepton cross - section measurement from lep experiments@xcite , which could attribute to single sneutrino productions and would set mass constraint on these neutrino super - partners .",
    "we have discussed the possibility of probing off - shell sneutrino effect induced by @xmath13 terms on a 500gev linear collider @xcite , and concluded that with current constraints on @xmath14 parameters one can extend sneutrino search up to @xmath15tev region which is far beyond the constraints from lep .",
    "nevertheless , despite the high performance of linear colliders and clean environment in their detectors , none of tesla , jlc or even ilc projects would be in commission in this decade .",
    "on the other hand , the tevatron hadron collider is currently in its upgrade run - ii physics and the lhc will be put into running in three years , and consequently more careful studies on direct susy searches including the potential detection of single sneutrino production on hadron colliders should be addressed in detail both experimentally and phenomenologically .    the first two terms @xmath16 and @xmath17 in the superpotential eq.([sup ] ) may lead to r - violating single sneutrino production and sequential lfv decay on hadron colliders .",
    "many papers studied these single sneutrino production modes both on- and off - mass - shell of sneutrino resonance via @xmath17 interactions and decay in r - parity conservation mode as @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "charginos and subsequential neutrolinos could decay in r - conserving way as well , e.g. @xmath19 and @xmath20 ; then sleptons from neutrolino would decay in r - violating modes as @xmath21 or @xmath22 . with these r - violating interaction vertexes involved in sneutrino and chargino / neutrolino decay chains , single sneutrino will subsequently decay to all the sm stable particles at last .",
    "namely , these single sneutrino production and subsequential @xmath23 decay processes are doubly r - violated , and unless light neutrolinos would live long enough to escape from detectors there would be more than three leptons in final states .",
    "these characteristic triple - lepton signals are obviously good for tagging new physics .",
    "but there are problems in susy parameter determination from these multiple leptons channels : firstly , the tri - lepton production can also be induced by r - conserving supersymmetric models , for instance , @xmath24 associated production may have the subsequential decay to three leptons and two stable @xmath25 as the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) which performances as missing energy in detector .",
    "so , these tri - lepton channels might not be able to distinguish supersymmetric r - violating interaction signals from those of r - conserving ones .",
    "secondly , since there are too many parameters involving in @xmath26 and chargino and neutrolino cascade decay , it is complicated to determine any of susy parameters decisively , and one has to adopt a very compactly simplified version of parameters such as msugra . on the contrary",
    ", the lfv di - lepton processes of sneutrino rare decay @xmath27 on hadron collider would provide an ideal detection channel for r - violating interactions and a potential means of abstracting some susy parameters experimentally . as we will show in following sections , with some reasonable assumption on parameter space and appropriate treatment on experimental observables ,",
    "one is not only able to select lfv di - lepton signals from numerous sm physics background , but also able to decouple the contribution of sneutrino part in signals from that of other susy parts , so that an unique sneutrino mass parameter could be abstracted explicitly .",
    "leaving alone the lhc in construction , tevatron run - ii upgrade is now in progress .",
    "it is expected to deliver an proton - antiproton collision integrated luminosity as @xmath28(@xmath29 ) per experiment at the energy of 1.96 tev , which will be quantitatively one order higher than the luminosity acquired in run - i with center of mass energy 1.8 tev .",
    "therefore , before lhc , the two experiments d  and cdf on the tevatron are the only available facilities to test r - violating interaction and search for sneutrino . in this paper , we will discuss the possibility of probing r - violating lfv di - lepton signals and abstracting sneutrino information from experimental observation at the tevatron run - ii .",
    "we investigate two di - lepton signal processes in which final states can be identified precisely even in hadron colliding environment , namely @xmath30 and its charge - conjugated process @xmath31 . by integrating the first two lepton number violation terms in eq.([sup ] )",
    ", one can obtain the lagrangian relevant to present discussion as @xmath32 where superscript @xmath33 refers to charge conjugation . in this work ,",
    "we simply take the r - violating parameters @xmath14 and @xmath34 to be real to avoid further complication .    in order to get optimal efficiency of signal detection , we choose not to distinguish the absolute sign of lepton charge , so that di - track events of @xmath35 final states would be treated equally as those of @xmath36 ones .",
    "this summation treatment of @xmath3 events denotes the summation of two final states @xmath35 and @xmath36 events . ]",
    "is based on the following consideration : firstly , it can double the statistic of signal events , which will improve the significance and confidence on collected signal samples .",
    "secondly , the charge determination of tracks with high transverse momentum(@xmath37 ) relies on many realistic detector - relevant factors , thus indiscrimination between @xmath38 and @xmath39 will remove systematic uncertainty on charge measurement . to reflect the summation measurement in theoretical calculation , we phenomenologically introduce an unique parton - level @xmath40 , to denote polar angles of both outgoing @xmath41 and @xmath42 with respect to the incoming parton from proton beam , and adopt a consistent momentum notation to all signal processes as @xmath43 where @xmath44 are the first generation partons , @xmath45 stands for the four - momenta of partons from proton beam whose direction of vector @xmath46 is along @xmath47 axis , and @xmath48 stands for those from anti - proton beam .",
    "we always use the four - momentum @xmath49 to denote outgoing @xmath41 and @xmath42 in signal processes , so that the open angle between @xmath50 and @xmath51 is precisely @xmath52 defined above .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath53 represents the four - momenta of final @xmath54 particles . neglecting electron and muon masses ,",
    "we introduce mandelstam invariant variables to describe kinematics of all the four signal subprocesses as @xmath55 and feynman diagrams of @xmath3 signals at parton level are depicted in figure 1 accordingly .",
    "we define the amplitude of @xmath56 subprocess as @xmath57 , where the superscript minus sign in parenthesis indicates the processes with negative charged electrons in final states , and in the following we will use the superscript @xmath58 to denote processes with positive charged outgoing positrons .",
    "the amplitude @xmath59 can be represented by @xmath60- and @xmath61-channel parts @xmath62 with @xmath63 @xmath64 and the notations of propagator factors @xmath65 are defined as follows @xmath66 where a sparticle width @xmath67 is introduced into the @xmath68-channel propagators to suppress resonance singularity .",
    "according to the feynman diagrams in figure 1 , the amplitude of @xmath69 subprocess has only @xmath70-channel part and can be denoted as @xmath71 with @xmath72 in above equation , @xmath73=@xmath74 are left- and right - hand project operators .",
    "@xmath75 is generation index of supersymmetric particles , @xmath76 denotes the two mass eigenstates of each scalar quark flavor . @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the @xmath79 matrices used to diagonalize various up and down - type squark mass matrices , respectively .    the amplitudes of the other type of signal subprocess @xmath80 , represented by eq.([proc2 ] ) , can be written out straightforward from above expressions of eq.([proc1 ] ) as @xmath81    the amplitudes of initial first generation sea quark collision subprocesses , represented by eq.([proc3],[proc4 ] ) , can be obtained from those of valence incoming quark subprocesses of eq.([proc1],[proc2 ] ) under following replacement @xmath82 by now all the signal amplitudes at parton level are given , where those of subprocess ( [ proc1 ] ) are written out explicitly , while those of the other three ones are obtained by appropriate initial and final state exchange respectively .",
    "in this paper , we mainly focus on probing sneutrino resonance effect via potential lfv @xmath3 signals at the tevatron run - ii .",
    "since the @xmath61 or @xmath70-channel squark internal exchange diagrams contribute into signal measurement and arose ambiguity in exploring sneutrino information , which makes sense via the @xmath68-channel exchange , we name all the squark contribution as pollution of the signal .",
    "fortunately , because of the r - violating scalar - pseudoscalar(s - p ) yukawa couplings of sfermion to dirac fermions as shown in eq.([lag ] ) , the interference terms among @xmath60-channel sneutrino exchange diagrams and @xmath61 and @xmath70-channel squark interchange ones get vanished in all subprocesses .",
    "we call the vanishing of the interference terms between amplitudes of @xmath83 and those of @xmath84 , as a decouple feature between the two parts of sneutrino and squark contributions . in this way",
    ", we might be able to abstract sneutrino information from @xmath85 measurement . in order to reduce the number of parameters in sneutrino and squark sections",
    ", we simply take that the mass spectrum of all flavor scalar quarks is highly degenerated , and reasonably assume the mass splitting among three heavy sneutrinos is trivial so that an unique mass scale parameter could be introduced in the sneutrino section .",
    "that means @xmath86",
    "@xmath87    to reflect the @xmath3 summation and the decouple feature between sneutrino and squark contributions in the calculation of the signal production cross - section at hadron - level , we define a set of parton - level differential cross - section components as @xmath88 where @xmath89\\cdot { \\nonumber}\\\\ & & \\sum_{i , i^{'}=1}^{3}\\sum_{k , k^{'}=1}^{2}(~\\lambda^{'}_{1i1 }     \\lambda^{'}_{2i1}|r_{k1}^{\\tilde u_i}|^2\\cdot   \\lambda^{'}_{1i^{'}1}\\lambda^{'}_{2i^{'}1}|r_{k^{'}1}^{\\tilde         u_{i^{'}}}|^2~ ) \\\\ { \\nonumber}\\\\ \\label{mtuuu }",

    "we take the r - parity violating parameters @xmath14 and @xmath34 under the experimental constraints presented in ref.@xcite .",
    "all the scale factors in the constraints which are susy particle mass dependent are simply ignored , so that the r - violating yukawa couplings could be naturally kept at values less than @xmath97(@xmath98 ) .",
    "thereby , there is only mass scale parameter @xmath99 in sneutrino section as free parameter which should be determined by experiment .",
    "the degenerate sneutrino mass parameter has to be constrained by the latest concrete lep collider data .",
    "for example , opal experiment has set an upper limit on @xmath100 as @xmath101 with @xmath102 at 95% cl @xcite . to get a consistent value with this observation",
    ", one can arrive at@xcite @xmath103 a unique sneutrino decay width @xmath67 is set to be @xmath104 , which results in a very short @xmath105 lifetime . the degenerate scalar quark mass",
    "is taken as @xmath106 except otherwise specified , and @xmath79 @xmath107 and @xmath108 mixing matrices are set to be unit for simplification .",
    "according to the decouple feature of sneutrino and squark section at parton level , we plot two independent contributions to the @xmath3 signal production cross - section on @xmath109 collider at @xmath110 , as the functions of corresponding mass parameter @xmath111 and @xmath112 respectively in figure 2 . due to the @xmath60-channel resonance enhancement ,",
    "the sneutrino contribution is dominant over the squark one in most region of parameter space .",
    "however , on account of the less density of valence quark p.d.f in higher energy region , the resonance enhancement would decrease with the increment of sneutrino mass , and the cross section drops to a few femto barn in the vicinity of @xmath113gev .",
    "the calculation shows as well that the cross - section at hadron level contributed by scalar quark exchange @xmath61+@xmath70-channel is 5@xmath114 when @xmath115gev , and becomes negligible when @xmath116gev .    a set of mc distributions of @xmath3 signal observables at the tevatron , i.e. polar angle @xmath117 , pseudo - rapidity @xmath118 and transverse momentum @xmath37 of outgoing electron , and invariant mass of @xmath3 system are plotted in figure 3 , with @xmath119gev and @xmath115gev where the pollution from scalar quark section is maximized .",
    "the sneutrino contribution is characterized by the di - lepton invariant mass peak around @xmath120 , and the lepton transverse energy tendency as @xmath121 , while the two leptons from squark section are much softer .",

    "it should be clarified here we adopt the eq .",

    ", we consider the following processes which have significant @xmath3 candidates in their final states @xmath122 where @xmath123 refers to decay products of @xmath124,@xmath125,@xmath126 and @xmath127 other than @xmath3 .",

    "these features of background would be useful to develop an efficient event selection strategy to suppress background and improve the significance of signal .",
    "taking the advantage of the collinearity and the resonance effect of energetic @xmath3 signal contributed by sneutrino section , we suggest following off - line event selection strategy at run - ii tevatron to reduce sm physical background as well as squark pollution    1 .",

    "there are two types of r - violating interactions involved in the lfv signal processes , namely the couplings of sneutrino - leptons(quarks ) vertices and those of squark - quark - lepton ones . fortunately , due to the r - violating s - p yukawa couplings of sfermion to dirac leptons and quarks , the contribution of sneutrino section is decoupled with that of squark part . accordingly , one is able to cut on an appropriate observable such as invariant mass @xmath170 to remove most of scalar quark pollution , and derive sneutrino mass parameter from purified data sample which is dominated by sneutrino contribution .",
