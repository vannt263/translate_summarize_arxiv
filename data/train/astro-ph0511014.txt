    "@xcite estimates the dust temperature to be @xmath130 k at kpc radii",
    ". however , in two other agn the presence of hotter dust at 100 times smaller radii , of @xmath1300 k , has been inferred from vlt observations @xcite . adopting a dust temperature of 100 k for ngc  3079 on intermediate scales and a dust opacity index @xmath37",

    "the 183  ghz emission we detect in the nucleus of ngc  3079 is likely from a maser process .",
    "it arises from one , and possibly more , narrow unresolved features in the same range of velocity as that of known 22  ghz maser emission . from radiative transfer models",
    "we know that the same high densities and temperature conditions that produce maser emission at 22  ghz also strongly invert the 183  ghz h@xmath0o transition . noting that the 22 ghz feature at 1017 km  s@xmath12 varies between 0.4  2.6 jy ( hagiwara et al .",
    "2002 ) , and assuming an ortho : para h@xmath0o ratio of 3:1 , pumping models could reproduce likely line ratios ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "narrow linewidths ( @xmath108 km  s@xmath12 ) at 183  ghz , small compared with the characteristic rotational and apparent random velocities for molecular gas in this nucleus @xcite , also indicate that emitting regions should be compact .",
    "our beam size is too large to determine whether emission is thermal or maser based on brightness temperature arguments . for the emission to be thermal , with a brightness temperature of @xmath44 2000 k such that h@xmath0o molecules are not dissociated",
    ", the emitting region must be @xmath45 0@xmath461 ( 10 pc ) .",
    "439 ghz emission is probably also due to maser amplification .",
    "emission occurs over a narrow velocity range ( fig .",
    "[ f:439ghz ] ) , and conditions for strong 439 ghz inversion are likely to exist in the galactic nucleus .",
    "the 22  ghz spectrum peaks to the blue of the v@xmath29 of 1125 km  s@xmath12 , yet the 439  ghz spectrum peaks slightly above v@xmath29 at 1157 km  s@xmath12 ( fig .",
    "[ f:439ghz ] ) .",
    "we ascribe this difference to the different pump mechanisms operating for each maser . whereas 22  ghz emission is collisionally - pumped and is increasingly quenched by local dust temperatures @xmath45100  k , the 439  ghz maser is predominantly radiatively - pumped and is most strongly inverted in the presence of @xmath47 , @xmath48 and n@xmath49 = 5 x 10@xmath50 @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "dust temperatures of this order and higher are reasonable in the central parsecs of the nucleus @xcite .",
    "peak 439  ghz emission ( 1157 km  s@xmath12 ) is therefore likely to originate from a hot , dusty region around the central engine , possibly at radii @xmath511 pc , separated spatially from the gas emitting most strongly at 22  ghz ( 956 km  s@xmath12 ) . at 22 ghz , features at these velocities are indeed separated spatially by @xmath11 pc projected @xcite .",
    "the observations in fig .",
    "[ f:439ghz ] were taken on different dates , and we note that the 22  ghz feature near 1157 km  s@xmath12 is not present at all epochs ( e.g. , in fig .",
