    "the bulk of the optical / uv continuum in radio - quiet quasars ( rqqs ) is associated with quasi - thermal emission originating in the accretion disk ( e.g. , shields 1978 ) , while the emission is postulated to arise from compton upscattering of disk photons occuring in a hot `` corona '' ( e.g. , haardt & maraschi 1991 ) .",
    "this scenario leads naturally to a correlation between optical / uv and luminosity .",

    "2009 ) have found that the optical / uv - to - x - ray spectral slope steepens ( in the sense that objects become relatively less luminous ) with increasing optical / uv luminosity .",
    "intriguingly , most studies ( see above references ) find that there does not appear to be significant evolution with redshift in the spectral energy distributions of rqqs ; despite the strong evolution in the space density of quasars , these studies generally find that rqqs in the early universe appear to have similar optical / uv - to - x - ray spectral slopes to their local analogs .",
    "radio - loud quasars ( rlqs ) are often defined to be the subset of quasars with a radio - loudness parameter satisfying @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the logarithmic ratio of monochromatic luminosities ( with units of erg  s@xmath6  hz@xmath6 ) measured at ( rest - frame ) 5  ghz and 2500    ( e.g. , stocke et al .  1992 ) ) in calculated @xmath5 values .",

    "rlqs comprise @xmath910% of quasars , with this fraction apparently varying with both luminosity and redshift ( e.g. , jiang et al .",
    "2007 and references therein ) .",
    "the definitive physical trigger for radio - loudness remains elusive , but rlqs generally have more massive central black holes than rqqs ( e.g. , laor 2000 ; metcalf & magliocchetti 2006 ; also , shankar et al .  2010 find this to be redshift - dependent ) , and it has also been suggested that rlqs host more rapidly spinning black holes than do rqqs ( e.g. , wilson & colbert 1995 ; meier 2001 ; but see also garofalo et al .",
    "rlqs and rqqs are typically treated as distinct populations , in part due to the apparent relative scarcity of objects with @xmath10 .",
    "the appropriateness of this canonical separation has been questioned due to the discovery of numerous quasars of intermediate radio - loudness ( e.g. , white et al .",
    "2000 ; cirasuolo et al .  2003 ) , which may outnumber rlqs ( e.g. , white et al .",
    "2007 ) , but there does appear to be a genuine bimodality of @xmath5 allowing fairly objective distinction between rqqs and rlqs ( e.g. , ivezi et al .  2004 ; zamfir et al .",
    "it should be noted that rqqs are not necessarily radio - silent ; for example , miller et al .",
    "( 1993 ) found the radio emission from radio - detected rqqs to be dominated by a starburst - linked component , and interpreted radio - intermediate quasars ( riqs ) as being rqqs in which a low - power and mildly relativistic jet is viewed at low inclinations ( see also , e.g. , falcke et al .",
    "1996 ; zamfir et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "the observed properties of rlqs and their likely parent population of radio galaxies are dependent upon orientation to the observer s line of sight ( e.g. , barthel 1989 ; urry & padovani 1995 ) . as with rqqs ( e.g. , antonucci 1993 ) ,",
    "there is believed to be an obscuring `` torus '' present in rlqs that blocks the broad - line region from view at large inclinations , but rlqs are further complicated by significant non - isotropic jet emission .",
    "radio jets have been measured to have relativistic bulk velocities on parsec scales from multi - epoch high - resolution radio imaging of moving knots in the inner jet , and the frequent lack of a detectable counterjet is consistent with doppler beaming ( e.g. , worrall & birkinshaw 2006 and references therein ) .",
    "rlq jets terminate in hotspots within lobes , for which the velocities are typically non - relativistic ( e.g. , scheuer 1995 ) and so this emission is relatively isotropic .",
    "both the ratio of radio core - to - lobe flux and the ratio of core radio - to - optical luminosities are observed to depend upon orientation , and these results suggest that both the lobe emission for a given inclination ( figure 1a of wills & brotherton 1995 ) ; this scatter may reflect environmental effects , which can be sufficient to induce lobe asymmetries ( e.g. , mackay et al .  1971 ; gopal - krishna & wiita 2000 ) . ] and the optical continuum in rlqs are correlated with intrinsic unbeamed jet power ( e.g. , wills & brotherton 1995 ) . the luminosities of narrow emission lines appear to correlate directly with jet power , with the link plausibly coming from a mutual underlying dependence upon accretion rate and/or black - hole spin ( e.g. , rawlings & saunders 1991 ; willott et al .",

    "it is also noteworthy in the context of unification schemes that fr  ii ( see fanaroff & riley  1974 for description of the fr  i and fr  ii classes ) radio - galaxy x - ray spectra typically show both a dominant absorbed and a weaker unabsorbed component , apparently linked with the disk / corona and jet , respectively ( e.g. , evans et al .",

    "1993 ; falcke et al .",
    "1996 ) , in which case the rqq relation ought to have the radio luminosity similarly enhanced prior to substitution for a first - order comparison .",

    "the targeted riqs and rlqs are at somewhat lower redshifts ( median @xmath189 of 1.05 versus 1.45 ) but are also brighter ( median @xmath221 of 17.94 versus 19.54 ) and so have modestly higher optical / uv luminosities ( median @xmath20 of 30.74 versus 30.33 ) .",
    "the targeted riqs and rlqs are also somewhat more radio - loud ( median @xmath5 of 3.09 versus 2.44 ) and @xmath940% x - ray brighter relative to optical / uv luminosity ( median @xmath222 of 0.53 versus 0.38 , with @xmath222 as defined in @xmath124 ) .",
    "presumably , targets were preferentially selected from sources already known to be bright .",
    "the results of parameterizing luminosity for the off - axis objects are similar to those obtained for the full and primary samples ( table  7 ) .",
    "the differences between the best - fit parameters for the slopes for the off - axis sample compared to the full or primary samples are essentially zero . for the @xmath223 model and @xmath224 , @xmath225 for the @xmath226 model . ] fitting the targeted objects separately indicates they possess a weaker dependence of luminosity upon optical / uv luminosity and perhaps a stronger dependence upon radio luminosity than do the full or primary samples , although their parameters are consistent with those of the spectroscopic sample .              a presumption that considered variables are normally distributed is inherent in the chosen method of analysis ( and indeed in most parametric modeling ) , and can be checked by examining the residuals from the best - fit models for x - ray luminosity in our sample of riqs and rlqs .",
    "histograms of the residual luminosity for riqs and rlqs , rlqs alone , and rqqs are provided in figure  17 . while it is not clear _ a priori _ that the riqs and rlqs considered here ought to show normally - distributed residual x - ray luminosity ( in logarithmic units ) ,",
    "since there are distinct x - ray emission mechanisms for riqs and rlqs ( disk / corona and jet - linked ) as opposed to a single dominant x - ray emission mechanism ( disk / corona ) in rqqs , it may be seen in figure  17 that the distributions closely match the overplotted best - fit gaussians .",

    "these bright objects are generally members of the set of particularly radio - loud or radio - luminous rlqs , and hence may be jet - dominated at frequencies .",
    "the degree of inherent scatter in the luminosities can affect the results of correlation studies .",
    "for example , yuan et al .",
    "( 1998 ) demonstrated that when the optical / uv luminosity scatter @xmath228 is significantly larger than the x - ray luminosity scatter @xmath229 , a fit to @xmath130 over a limited range of @xmath20 can indicate an anti - correlation where none necessarily exists .",
    "relatedly , @xmath230 can give a fitted slope for the @xmath147 relation less than unity even if these luminosities are actually proportional ( when the considered luminosity ranges are small ) .",
    "in general , examined luminosity correlations are significantly less likely to yield spurious or inaccurate results with a sample spanning a large range in luminosities relative to the observed dispersion ( e.g. , see discussion in @xmath125 of just et al .",
    "2007 ) , as does our sample .",
    "it is possible to assess the luminosity scatter through consideration of the standard deviation of the residuals about the @xmath231 relation . for the primary sample ,",
    "these values are 0.34/0.71/1.30 for @xmath232 , with corresponding 5th95th percentile luminosity ranges of 25.8127.62/29.4031.26/31.4734.46 ( treating limits as detections for this calculation only ) .",
    "this fit is performed treating @xmath21 as the dependent variable , so the residuals about this fit are larger than the inherent scatter .",
    "we use a monte carlo approach to determine the corresponding @xmath233 values . for simplicity , we simulate @xmath234 as uniformly distributed ( @xmath235 ) between 29.50 and 31.25 , with @xmath236 = @xmath234 + 2.5 ( with random log - normal scatter of @xmath237 ) and @xmath238 calculated from @xmath156 .",
    "then random log - normal scatter @xmath239 is added to the model luminosities and the standard deviations of the residuals and the luminosity ranges are calculated . a good match to the observed data is provided with @xmath240 = 0.28/0.32/0.42 , and @xmath241 gives a radio - loudness standard deviation of @xmath370.75 in agreement with the primary sample .",
    "we assess the impact of such inherent scatter by fitting the simulated data ( including censoring as described in @xmath126.1.3 ) .",
    "this scatter acts to depress the dependence of luminosity upon optical / uv and radio luminosities , so that fitted values of @xmath166 and @xmath161 are slightly lower than those used in the input @xmath173 relation .",
    "the observed best - fit values of @xmath242 and @xmath243 for the primary sample would result in fitted coefficients of 0.39 and 0.23 , respectively , and may themselves be obtained for input coefficients of @xmath370.6 and @xmath370.3 , respectively .",
    "further , data simulated with an input model of @xmath163 that is then fit as @xmath147 produce fitted values for @xmath166 greater than the input coefficient ( e.g. , fitted @xmath244 for input @xmath245=0.6/0.3 ) , as suggested in @xmath125.2.1 .",
    "a contribution to the luminosity linked to the radio luminosity appears to be mandated for riqs and rlqs . for the derived inherent scatter ,",

    "data simulated with an input model of @xmath247 that is then fit as @xmath156 produce fitted coefficients of @xmath248 and @xmath249 . if @xmath19 is initially taken directly from @xmath20 ( i.e. , @xmath250 ) , the fitted coefficients are @xmath251 and @xmath252 , but the scatter in radio - loudness is then significantly lower than observed .",
    "( using @xmath253 with @xmath175 and @xmath176 as in @xmath125.2.2 gives similar results . )",
    "we note for completeness that more extreme values of @xmath240 could distort luminosity correlations ( e.g. , for @xmath254 = 0.28/0.64/0.42 or 0.28/0.32/0.84 rather than the derived 0.28/0.32/0.42 , input parameters of @xmath245=0.6/0.3 give fitted coefficients of 0.22/0.33 or 0.56/0.15 , respectively ) .",
    "however , as demonstrated above , these considerations do not apply to our sample .",
    "additionally , since much of our analysis is concerned with comparing the results of ( similarly conducted ) fits to different groupings of riqs and rlqs , any modest systematic skewing of correlations does not impact our conclusions regarding the relative differences in how luminosity is dependent on optical / uv and radio luminosities within these subgroups .",
    "it is of interest to evaluate the physical basis for the correlations discussed in @xmath125 .",
    "it is widely theorized that the increasing x - ray brightness of riqs and rlqs with increasing radio loudness or luminosity is driven by a source of nuclear x - ray emission that is directly or indirectly powered by the radio jet ( e.g. , see discussion in @xmath121 ) , but the precise nature of this linkage is not clearly understood .",
    "we make use of previous results from the literature to simulate a population of riqs and rlqs with radio and optical properties consistent with observations , and then test competing models for the x - ray emission through comparing the properties of the simulated data sets to observations . the structure and parameters of this modeling are given in table  9 .",
    "we adopt a physical model that contains emission contributions from the core and lobes at radio frequencies ( making the common assumption that the core is dominated by the small - scale radio jet , but see also bell & comeau 2010 ) , from the disk and small - scale jet at optical / uv frequencies , and from the disk / corona and an additional `` jet - linked '' component at x - ray frequencies .",
    "most of the parameters for the radio and optical emission components in this model are fixed by prior work ; likely values for a few free parameters were determined through comparison to our sample data ( see table  9 for details ) .",
    "the x - ray disk / corona emission is presumed to scale with the optical / uv disk emission as established for rqqs , as seems reasonable based on the results of @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "the doppler beaming factor is @xmath255 ( e.g. , worrall & birkinshaw  2006 ) .",
    "we consider three possibilities for the x - ray jet - linked emission :    * in model a , the jet - linked emission is proportional to the intrinsic radio - jet emission ( prior to applying beaming ) and is also itself unbeamed . * in model b , the x - ray jet - linked emission shares the beaming factor @xmath256 that applies to the radio - jet emission . * in model c",
    ", the x - ray jet - linked emission has a lower bulk lorentz factor @xmath257 ( and thus a lower beaming factor @xmath258 at low inclinations ) than the radio - jet emission .",
    "the models a , b , and c correspond in a general sense to cases in which the jet - linked x - ray emission originates in an additional accretion flow structure , or co - spatially with the radio - jet emission , or within the small - scale jet but predominantly in a less - relativistic region , respectively . note that we are not attempting to model the emission in individual sources ( such an approach is unproductive with these data ) .",
    "we instead conduct a statistical study to examine different plausible and representative physical scenarios , and present the consequent implications including , for example , the implied fraction of riqs and rlqs for which the x - ray emission is jet - dominated .    in this section",
    ", we first describe the various components of the basic model , then match the simulated luminosities to the observed primary sample data , and then consider additional observational constraints upon the models and determine the dominant source of x - ray emission in each case .",
    "we follow the general unification scheme described by jackson & wall ( 1999 ) , in which fr  i and low - excitation emission - line fr  ii radio galaxies are the parent population of bl lacs , while high - excitation emission - line fr  ii radio galaxies are the parent population of rlqs ( cf",

    "the normalization ( i.e. , number of objects ) of the simulated population should be able to be set solely based on the sky coverage fraction of the observed sample , but this is difficult to evaluate for the various x - ray missions and their complex instrumental fields of view .",
    "matched total numbers of simulated and sample objects are not critical for conducting a comparison ( it is the distribution of luminosities that is of interest ) ; nonetheless , it is convenient for examining the results of the simulations if the simulated population is of the same size as the observed sample .",

    "fortunately , our goal of evaluating luminosity as a function of radio and optical / uv luminosity does not depend on redshift ( e.g. , see @xmath125.3 ) , and so it is not necessary to account for all the various selection effects that may influence the difference in redshift distribution .",

    "the simulated objects are color - coded by inclination ( blue for @xmath295 , green for @xmath296 , and red for @xmath297 ) . for model a , there is essentially no inclination dependence to the x - ray excess , since the x - ray luminosity is unbeamed . for model",
    "b , there is a strong inclination dependence , with the lowest inclination rlqs being extremely x - ray bright ( to a degree that does not match observations ) .",
    "note that these simulated low - inclination objects are still expected to be disk - dominated at optical / uv frequencies ( as also applies to models a and c ) and are thus not blazars , so the comparison to the observed primary sample ( from which all identified blazars have been removed ) is properly matched . for model c , there is a definite but modest dependence upon inclination .",
    "simultaneous consideration of the distribution of radio , optical / uv , and luminosities , following the analysis performed in @xmath124 and @xmath125 for observed riqs and rlqs , provides additional insight helpful to evaluating the feasibility of the three models .",
    "we now assess the accuracy with which these models ( generated as described in @xmath126.1 , @xmath126.2 , and table  9 ) reproduce the observed dependence of luminosity upon radio and optical / uv luminosities .",
    "we first examine how the `` excess '' x - ray luminosity ( x - ray luminosity minus that of a rqq of matched optical / uv luminosity ) for the simulated riqs and rlqs depends upon radio loudness for the three models . in figure  19 ,",
    "left - hand side , the simulated objects are again color - coded by inclination , and the primary sample data are plotted along with the median and interquartile range measurements from figure  7a .",
    "it may be observed that model a does not appear to capture accurately the rise in x - ray brightness with increasing radio loudness .",
    "this is because in model a the x - ray luminosity is unbeamed , whereas the radio luminosity is beamed , and so the most radio - luminous and radio - loud objects tend to have low inclinations ( are color - coded blue ) but are not brighter than higher inclination objects .",
    "conversely , model b overpredicts the degree to which brightness depends on increasing radio loudness , or inclination .",
    "it is only for model c that the x - ray brightness compared to rqqs may be seen to increase with radio loudness in a manner analogous to that observed .",
    "modeling x - ray luminosity as a joint function of optical / uv and radio luminosity , as done for the observed riqs and rlqs in @xmath125.2 , makes clear the differing manner in which the three models are dependent on optical / uv and radio luminosity ( see table  10 ) .",
    "the right - hand side of figure  19 shows the joint 90% confidence ellipses for the primary ( red ) and for the full ( black ) observed samples , along with the calculated result for each model ( blue ) . for model a , the x - ray luminosity is strongly dependent on optical / uv luminosity but only weakly dependent on radio luminosity .",
    "the best - fit relation for the population simulated with model a is @xmath298 .",
    "this result reflects the underlying dependence of both the optical disk emission ( and thereby the disk / corona component ) and the `` jet - linked '' x - ray component on the intrinsic ( unbeamed ) radio - jet luminosity .",
    "the parameterization of luminosity upon optical / uv and radio luminosity in model a is inconsistent with the fits to the primary and full samples . for model",
    "b , the x - ray luminosity is strongly dependent upon radio luminosity but only weakly dependent on optical / uv luminosity .",
    "this result is due to the increased dominance of the continuum by jet - linked emission for a large fraction of the simulated sources , particularly those at low inclinations .",
    "the best - fit relation for the population simulated with model b is @xmath299 .",
    "this reflects the mutual beaming of the radio and jets , but these parameters are also inconsistent with observations . for model c ,",
    "the x - ray luminosity is dependent upon both optical / uv and radio luminosities in a manner similar to that observed , as illustrated by the overlapping confidence ellipses .",
    "the best - fit relation for the population simulated with model c is @xmath300 .",
    "this result reflects the milder beaming with @xmath286 that places model c in some sense intermediate between model a and model b. for comparison , model c with @xmath301 ( models c1.5/c3 ; best - fit relations given in table  10 and shown as dotted blue ellipses in figure  19 ) bracket the @xmath286 result but do not provide as close a match to observations .",
    "the simulated populations may be utilized to evaluate the dominant emission component at each frequency , and in particular to examine the degree to which x - ray luminosity is dominated by the jet - linked component , as a function of inclination , for the different models ( see figure  20 ) . in nearly all cases ,",
    "the optical / uv luminosity is disk - dominated . for most sources , and for all the low - inclination sources ,",
    "the radio luminosity is jet - dominated . in each of models a , b , and c ,",
    "the x - ray luminosity is dominated by disk / corona emission for a sizeable fraction of objects ; there is agreement that despite the greater median x - ray luminosities of riqs and rlqs relative to rqqs , there are many individual objects for which a disk / corona analogous to that in rqqs is sufficient to produce the majority of observed emission . for models",
    "b and c , the degree to which the x - ray emission is jet - dominated is correlated with the degree to which the radio emission is jet - dominated ( to a lesser degree in model c , for which the beaming factor is lower ) . for the preferred model c ,",
    "the majority of objects with inclinations less than @xmath302 have x - ray luminosities dominated by jet - linked emission .    despite the general nature of the scenarios considered under models",
    "a , b , and c , these simulations provide insight into the degree to which the `` excess '' x - ray luminosity in riqs and rlqs is jet - linked and beamed .",
    "it seems likely that some beaming must be present , as model a does not satisfactorily match observations ; this conclusion is consistent with the results of previous work ( e.g. , browne & murphy 1987 ; shastri et al .",
    "it also appears that the jet - linked emission is beamed to a lesser degree than affects the radio jet , as model b does not satisfactorily match observations ; this result has also been suggested by other work ( e.g. , dou & yuan  2008 ) .",
    "the success of model c suggests that the majority of the jet - linked x - ray emission is not produced cospatially with the radio jet emission , but likely primarily originates in a somewhat slower jet region .",
    "the preferred model c implies that high signal - to - noise x - ray spectroscopy of riqs or rlqs established ( e.g. , from radio properties ) as possessing intermediate inclinations should result in some such objects showing x - ray spectra in which an unabsorbed disk / corona - linked component and a jet - linked component are simultaneously apparent .",
    "this is consistent with observational results ( although additional studies would help establish this point ) ; for example , sambruna et al .",
    "( 2006 ) describe three rlqs with concave broken power law spectra , which they attribute to dual jet / disk - corona components",
    ".    future work with significantly larger samples and denser coverage of the @xmath0 plane plane . ] could potentially investigate whether the small - scale jet has velocity structure ( as in a fast - spine / slow - sheath model ; see , e.g. , jester et al .",
    "2006b ) , most simply through considering two x - ray jet components with differing bulk lorentz factors .",
    "modeling deficiencies that are unlikely to impact these results but could be addressed to improve the precision of comparison to data include limited consideration of selection effects and ad - hoc normalization of simulated sample size .",
    "although we have not conducted an exhaustive search of the multidimensional parameter space , the presented models ( a , b , c , c1.5 , and c3.0 ) together cover a large range of plausible possibilities , and from this set model c best matches observations .",
    "it is of interest to evaluate whether a modified set of models would still yield qualitatively similar results . here , we briefly describe the effects of altering selected model parameters in a reasonable fashion .",
    "minor adjustments to the log offsets between intrinsic radio - jet luminosity and intrinsic jet - linked x - ray luminosity are generally made without comment below ; other model parameters are as given in @xmath126.1 , @xmath126.2 , and table  9 , unless otherwise stated .    the credible interval for @xmath303 from the adopted mullin & hardcastle ( 2009 ) model ranges from 3.20 to 14.05 .",
    "the higher @xmath303 produces an acceptable match to the primary sample radio and optical / uv luminosities ( ks probabilities of 0.59/0.26/0.13 for @xmath304 ) and can match the x - ray luminosity of models a and c but not b ( ks probabilities of for a / b / c )",
    ". the lower @xmath303 does not easily give a good match to both the radio and optical / uv luminosities .",
    "for a ratio of optical / uv disk emission to unbeamed radio emission of @xmath268 ( logarithmic units ) and a minimum inclination of 4@xmath305 , the ks probabilities are 0.059/0.075/0.0076 for @xmath304 .",
    "the simulated median x - ray luminosities may be matched to observations with resulting ks probabilities of 0.35/@xmath306/0.10 for models a / b / c . in this scenario",
    "the majority of the simulated objects have inclinations with @xmath307 , but the brightness of the lower - inclination objects cause the increase in `` excess '' x - ray luminosity with increasing radio - loudness for model b and ( to a lesser degree ) model c to be more rapid than observed . for model",
    "c under this scenario , the dependence of luminosity upon optical / uv and radio luminosity is weaker and stronger ( @xmath308 and @xmath309 ) , respectively , than holds for the primary sample .",
    "willott et al .  ( 2001 ) consider two additional models for their radio luminosity function in addition to the version we use ( see their @xmath123.2 ) .",
    "if instead a population of riqs and rlqs is simulated based on their model which contains a steeper high - redshift decay ( their equation  11 ) , then an acceptable match to the primary sample may be obtained ( ks probabilities of 0.24/0.12/0.42 for @xmath310 ) with a ratio of optical / uv disk emission to unbeamed radio emission of @xmath311 .",
    "the ks probabilities for matching simulated versus observed x - ray luminosity are 0.065/@xmath306/0.35 for models a / b / c .",
    "model b is again not a good match . if instead the willott et al .",
    "( 2001 ) model which becomes constant at high redshift ( their equation  12 ) is used to simulate a population of riqs and rlqs , the match to the primary sample is again acceptable ( ks probabilities of 0.082/0.19/0.26 for @xmath310 ) .",
    "the ks probabilities for matching simulated versus observed x - ray luminosity are 0.10/@xmath306/0.20 for models a / b / c .",
    "model b remains a poor match .",
    "additionally , the median simulated redshift ( prior to matching redshifts to the primary sample ) is 1.95/2.22 for the spectroscopic",
    "/ photometric magnitude cutoffs , higher than that of the primary sample ( 1.41 ) and also higher than that simulated with the version of the willott et al .",
    "( 2001 ) model we use ( 1.79/1.88 ) .",
    "we also consider a scenario in which the x - ray jet emission is beamed as @xmath312 ( similarly to the radio jet emission ) rather than as @xmath271 .",
    "this might apply if , for example , the x - ray jet emission were to be dominated by synchrotron emission from a secondary population of high - energy electrons .",
    "this change only affects models b and c. maintaining and adjusting the x - ray jet offsets to @xmath313 , the ks probabilities are 0.065/0.76 for models",
    "b / c . with less extreme x - ray beaming model b can match the observed distribution of x - ray luminosities .",
    "however , model b still predicts a greater fraction of x - ray - bright objects than is observed , and the increase in `` excess '' x - ray luminosity with increasing radio - loudness is also more rapid than observed .",
    "model c remains a superior explanation of the data . for model",
    "c under this scenario , the dependence of luminosity upon optical / uv and radio luminosity is moderately stronger and weaker ( @xmath314 and @xmath315 ) , respectively , than holds for the primary sample .",
    "the primary results of our analysis of the nuclear properties of riqs and rlqs are the following :    \\1 .",
    "sample : we have compiled a sample of 188 riqs and 603 rlqs ( primarily by matching optically selected sdss quasars to the first survey , taking into account extended radio emission ) with high - quality archival x - ray coverage by _",
    "chandra _ , _ xmm - newton _ , or _",
    "rosat_. the full sample is almost unbiased with respect to properties , has a high ( 85% ) detection rate , and can be utilized to investigate the nature and origin of x - ray emission in riqs and rlqs .",
    "the sample size is significantly larger than earlier studies of rlqs and provides superior coverage of the luminosity - redshift plane .",
    "trends : we calculate the ratio of x - ray luminosity in riqs and rlqs relative to that of comparable rqqs and determine how this ratio increases with both radio loudness and luminosity .",
    "this ratio of `` excess '' x - ray luminosity ranges from @xmath90.72.8 for riqs through the canonical @xmath93 for rlqs to @xmath31610 for strongly radio - loud ( @xmath317 ) or luminous ( @xmath318 ) objects .",
    "we also carry out fits to the x - ray luminosity as a function of both optical and radio luminosity , which are useful for determining the `` typical '' x - ray luminosity for any given riq or rlq .",
    "the emission in riqs is not significantly dependent upon radio luminosity .",
    "we quantify the manner in which rlqs become more x - ray luminous for large @xmath5 or @xmath19 or for flat radio spectra .",
    "finally , we do not find any significant redshift dependence in the properties of riqs and rlqs ( implying , e.g. , that ic / cmb jet - linked emission does not contribute substantially to the nuclear continuum ) .",
    "models : we conduct monte carlo simulations based on a low - frequency radio luminosity function to which we add a randomly inclined relativistic jet .",
    "the optical disk emission is successfully modeled as correlated with the intrinsic ( unbeamed ) radio - jet luminosity , and the x - ray emission contains both disk / corona and jet - linked components .",
    "we consider three models for the non - coronal core x - ray luminosity component , and conclude that the jet - linked x - ray emission is likely beamed but with a lesser bulk lorentz factor than applies to the radio - jet emission .",
    "the alternative possibilities of unbeamed emission and of emission with @xmath319 as for the radio jet do not appear to match adequately the observed data . for the preferred model , the radio emission is mostly jet dominated , the optical / uv emission is almost exclusively disk dominated , and the x - ray emission is split between disk / corona and jet - linked components with the jet becoming increasingly dominant at low inclinations .",

    "2008 ) of rlqs have bals and are , like bal rqqs , relatively weak due to intrinsic absorption ( e.g. , brotherton et al .  2005 ; gibson et al .",
    "2008 ; miller et al .",
    "since we are interested in intrinsic emission and not absorption , we exclude from our sample any objects included in the sdss bal catalog of gibson et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and also any rlqs we are aware of as possessing bals not observable in the sdss spectrum ( e.g. , j100726.10 + 124856.2 , the @xmath322 object pg  1004 + 130 identified as a bal rlq by wills et al .",
    "1999 ) . through this process 22",
    "bal quasars are identified and dropped from further consideration .",
    "contamination from low - redshift ( @xmath323 ) rlqs not identifiable as having bals due to sdss bandpass limitations ( e.g. , spectroscopic quasars lacking coverage of the  region , which includes the strong c  iv bal transition ) is estimated to be @xmath92% of the entire sample,8% ( e.g. , shankar et al .",
    "2008 ) of the 210 spectroscopic riqs and rlqs with @xmath323 are bal quasars , out of a total sample of 791 objects ; bal contamination within the photometric sample is addressed separately in @xmath122.1.2 . ] and a small number of weak outliers would not materially impact our results below .",
    "objects with apparent heavy intrinsic reddening are sometimes also associated with absorption ( e.g. , hall et al .",
    "the quantity @xmath64 ( plotted in figure 2 ) is the @xmath324 color of an object ( corrected for galactic extinction ) less the median @xmath324 quasar color at the redshift of that object ; negative @xmath64 values correspond to objects bluer than the norm and positive @xmath64 values indicate redder colors ( e.g. , richards et al .",
    "2001 ) . for reference ,",
    "the median relative color for our sample of spectroscopic sdss riqs and rlqs is @xmath325 ( there is a general tendency for rlqs to have somewhat redder colors than rqqs ; e.g. , labita et al .",
    "almost all non - reddened objects have @xmath54 while intrinsically reddened ( and potentially absorbed ) objects form a tail in the distribution that extends past this value ( e.g. , hall et al .",
    "2006 ) , so objects with @xmath63 are culled from the sample .",
    "this cut removes 8 objects that would otherwise be included ( an additional 4 of the already excluded bal quasars also have @xmath63 ) .",
    "finally , 3 objects possess radio spectra ( described in @xmath123.3 ) indicating they are ghz - peaked spectrum ( gps ; e.g. , odea 1998 ) sources , which are generally considered to be young sources and have x - ray properties that are not necessarily representative of rlqs in general ( e.g. , siemiginowska et al .",
    "2008 ) ; these gps sources are therefore culled and not considered further .",
    "extended radio sources ( with jets or lobes ) may have separate entries in the first source catalog for each detected component , and lobe - dominated sources do not always possess a detected core component .",
    "it is therefore necessary to match to the entire environment surrounding each quasar to recover all associated emission ( e.g. , best et al .",
    "2005 ; lu et al .",
    "very few radio sources that lack a core component have lobe - to - lobe angular sizes greater than 90@xmath27 ( e.g. , de vries et al .",
    "2006 ) , so we search for radio emission within 90@xmath27 of each optically - selected quasar .",
    "we considered as candidates for radio - detected quasars those objects with a radio source within 2@xmath27 , referred to hereafter as the core , or two or more radio sources within 2@xmath326 of which at least one pair has component angular orientations relative to the core differing by more than 90@xmath305 ( where a 180@xmath305 separation would indicate components on directly opposite sides of the core ) , classified as potential lobes pending additional review .",
    "the potential lobes were then matched to the sdss photometric catalog , and if they had an optical counterpart ( unless that apparent counterpart was a spectroscopically - classified star ) they were flagged as intruding background sources and not considered further in determining the radio characteristics of that quasar ; if this process left only one potential lobe and no core then the object was eliminated as not radio - detected . all objects with remaining potential lobes",
    "were then examined visually to screen further for misclassifications ( for example , unrelated background double - lobed radio sources are readily identifiable by eye as intruding but are difficult to categorize correctly automatically ) .",
    "a few cases in which an obviously - associated extended component had been mistakenly flagged as background due to a randomly coincident sdss optical source were also corrected .",
    "visual screening also identified four objects with likely associated radio components outside the 90@xmath27 consideration radius ( j093200.08 + 553347.4 , j112956.53 + 364919.2 , j094745.14 + 072520.6 , and j142735.60 + 263214.5 , with maximal lobe offset from the core of 93@xmath27 , 99@xmath27 , 117@xmath27 , and 148@xmath27 , respectively ) ; since we wish to take into account all lobe emission from objects already included in the sample , these components were added to the total radio fluxes for these objects .",
    "visual screening also confirmed that the first catalog contains entries for all obvious components in all sources included in the sample [ with only one exception : we added a core component to j170441.37 + 604430.5 ( 3c  351 ) based on examination of the first and other radio maps ] .",
    "the first survey is not particularly sensitive to large - scale regions of low surface brightness , so diffuse lobes may not be detected or may have their fluxes underestimated ( e.g. , lu et al .",
    "the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ; condon et al .",
    "1998 ) provides lower angular resolution coverage that complements the high angular resolution imaging of first ; 1.4  ghz fluxes from the nvss catalog were used for a handful of obviously extended first sources .",

    "where both _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ provide coverage , the observation with the greatest signal - to - noise ratio ( estimated based on exposure time , off - axis angle , detector efficiency , and average background ) was used .",
    "_ rosat _ observations were ranked by signal - to - noise ratio , and lower - quality observations were discarded . the threshold value for discarding _ rosat _",
    "observations was chosen so as to provide a large sample size while maintaining a relatively high detection fraction . in cases where multiple _ rosat _ observations were available , the observation with the greatest signal - to - noise ratio was used . despite their lower sensitivity , the _ rosat _ observations are useful for this project , as they provide a large area of sky coverage beyond that available solely from _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations . note",

    "we fit luminosity as a function of various parameters using the idl code of kelly ( 2007 ) , which takes into account censoring of the dependent variable and uncertainties in all variables .",
    "this is an advance over methods that consider either censoring ( e.g. , asurv ) or errors ( e.g. , the idl program fitexy ) but not both simultaneously . here , we illustrate the fitting technique through application to the rqq sample of steffen et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , for which results using an alternative method ( asurv ) have already been reported .    in this sample of rqqs",
    "the uncertainties are dominated by intrinsic variability ( see , e.g. , @xmath123.5 of gibson et al .",
    "2008 ) , as is also the case for the riqs and rlqs that form the primary focus of this work .",
    "the uncertainties we use throughout are based on observed data , but we investigate here the degree to which the fitting results are sensitive to alternative values for the uncertainties .",
    "figure  21a shows @xmath147 computed for rqqs for our standard errors ( solid line ) , for a fit resulting from doubling the standard errors ( dashed line ) , and for a fit resulting from halving the standard errors ( dotted line ) .",
    "the coefficients for the standard error fit are @xmath350 ; for the double errors fit they are @xmath351 ; for the half errors fit they are @xmath352 .",
    "when comparing the coefficient values it must be kept in mind that these coefficients are probabilistically derived , so a large number of fits would be required to quantify most accurately the impact of using different error values .",
    "however , it is clear that varying the uncertainties within reasonable bounds does not dramatically alter the parameters of the best - fit line ( i.e. , the credible intervals of the parameters overlap ) .",
    "the best - fit model obtained through using the kelly ( 2007 ) code agrees with that calculated by steffen et al .  ( 2006 ) using asurv and treating @xmath21 as the dependent variable ( their equation 1a ) , which is @xmath353 using our normalization convention .",
    "as described in @xmath125.1 , it seems reasonable on both practical and statistical grounds to consider @xmath21 as the dependent variable throughout .",
    "however , other approaches are possible ; we investigate the effect of considering @xmath20 as the dependent variable and of using the bisector best - fit line .",
    "when fitting @xmath354 and inverting the results , the slope will generally be steeper than for the fit conducted with @xmath21 as the dependent variable .",
    "a complicating factor is that it is no longer possible to consider the censoring in @xmath21 .",
    "however , treating all upper limits as detections , we find @xmath355 , which may be compared with the steffen et al .",
    "( 2006 ) result ( their equation 1b ) of @xmath356 .",
    "for reference , the best - fit lines calculated using the idl program fitexy are @xmath357 and @xmath358 treating @xmath21 and @xmath20 in turn as the dependent variable . calculating the bisector using table  1 of isobe et al .",
    "( 1990 ) gives @xmath359 for our fits , or @xmath360 from steffen et al .",
    "( 2006 ; their equation 1c ) .",
    "the bisector slope is slightly higher , but it may be seen in figure  21b that the change in the distance from the best - fit line for any given point is at most @xmath90.2 over the span of the variables . when we discuss `` outliers '' or `` positive residuals '' we are referring to greater distances from the best - fit line .",
    "we note that the best - fit lines may not always appear to run through the highest density of points when upper limits are present ; for example , the riq fit to @xmath147 in figure  9a may appear different than would be the case were all of the upper limits detections .    as a final consistency check",
    ", we also performed every fit given in table  7 with asurv.500 objects ) we randomly selected @xmath9500 objects to fit with asurv . ] in all cases , the parameters agreed ( in the sense that the 1@xmath28 intervals overlapped ) with those computed using the code of kelly  ( 2007 ) .",
    "the median differences between the best - fit parameters obtained using the code of kelly  ( 2007 ) and those obtained with asurv ( and the standard deviations thereof ) for the @xmath170 model are @xmath361 for @xmath362 and @xmath363 for @xmath166 ; without considering the uncertainties , asurv apparently computes slightly flatter slopes for these datasets ( recall that the typical values for @xmath166 are 0.60.8 in these fits , so this systematic difference is 34% ) . the median differences ( and standard deviations ) for the @xmath167 model are @xmath364 for @xmath362 , @xmath365 for @xmath166 , and @xmath366 for @xmath161 .",
    "for illustrative purposes , if the kelly  ( 2007 ) code is run with an uncertainty on @xmath20 of 0.05 rather than 0.114 ( keeping the uncertainties on @xmath19 and @xmath21 at 0.0792 and 0.146 ) , the average change in @xmath367 is @xmath368 , producing coefficients matching the asurv results ( with a similar impact on @xmath166 in the @xmath147 relation ) .",

    "<S> finally , we consider a model in which the nuclear emission contains both disk / corona - linked and jet - linked components and demonstrate that the jet - linked emission is likely beamed but to a lesser degree than applies to the radio jet . </S>",
    "<S> this model is used to investigate the increasing dominance of jet - linked emission at low inclinations . </S>"
