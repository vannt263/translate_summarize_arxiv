    "changes of hadron properties in the nuclear medium have recently attracted great interests in theoretical studies .",
    "they also have induced the on - going experiments and forthcoming experimental plans in heavy nuclei in gsi and in relativistic heavy - ion collisions in sps at cern and ags , rhic at bnl@xcite . in particular the spectral changes of vector mesons",
    "are expected to be a possible signal to investigate such medium effect , because their leptonic decay in the medium can supply us information of the medium without disturbance of the strong interaction .",
    "motivated by this experimental advantage , the in - medium effect of the light vector - mesons ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) has been mainly studied in effective hadronic models@xcite and qcd sum rules ( qsrs)@xcite .",
    "recently we applied the qsr method to low - lying heavy - quarkonium ( @xmath3 ) in order to investigate its mass shift in nuclear matter and the @xmath3-nucleon interaction at low energy@xcite .",
    "it was shown that the @xmath3 mass at normal matter density drops by @xmath11 of its vacuum value .",
    "this negative mass - shift of @xmath3 corresponds to a small decrease of the mass , @xmath12 mev@xcite .",
    "this is much smaller than the similar effect in the light mesons such as @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "this difference can be understood as follows : in qsr the magnitude of the spectral change is related to the in - medium change of quark and gluon condensates @xcite . in the linear density approximation ,",
    "the quark operators give a dominant contribution for @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and have significant change in the matter . on the other hand ,",
    "the dominant in - medium gluon condensates at the normal matter density for @xmath3 are only @xmath15 smaller than its vacuum value .    in this paper",
    ", we generalize the above calculations and apply the qsr analysis in ref . to light and heavy quark systems with unequal mass .",
    "we focus on in - medium properties of pseudoscalar mesons @xmath0 s . studying",
    "the mass modification of the @xmath0-mesons in the nuclear medium is important by the following physical reasons :    1 .",
    "a part of total cross section of the @xmath0-meson production attributes a conversion of the @xmath16-states such as @xmath3 and @xmath17 into open - charm pairs .",
    "the component is produced through the reaction , @xmath18 , in high energy proton - nucleus collisions and relativistic high energy heavy - ion collisions .",
    "it contains a heavy charm - quark and a light quark .",
    "the existence of a light quark in the @xmath0-meson causes much difference of the properties in the nuclear medium between the @xmath0-meson and @xmath3 .",
    "the latter is dominated by the gluon condensates as discussed above , while the former has a large contribution from the light - quark condensates , multiplied by a charm - quark mass .",
    "furthermore @xmath3 predominantly interacts with light hadrons solely through gluonic content effects in matter , while the @xmath0-mesons will couple strongly through inelastic channels such as @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 or @xmath22 @xmath23 .",
    "thus we can expect a large modification of the @xmath0-meson in the nuclear medium as well as @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the existence of novel states , so - called the @xmath0-mesic nuclei , has been predicted by quark meson coupling ( qmc ) model @xcite .",
    "the qmc model suggests that @xmath24 may be bound in heavy atoms such as @xmath25pb by an attractive scalar - meson exchange and an attractive coulomb force .",
    "it also suggests that @xmath26 is deeply bound in the nuclei by an attractive @xmath14-meson exchange . in view of qsr , it is of importance to investigate the @xmath0 meson - nucleon ( @xmath8 ) interaction .",
    "the nuclear absorption of the @xmath0-mesons created in @xmath27-@xmath28 and @xmath29-@xmath28 collisions ( @xmath28 denotes targets such as be , cu , al , w and au ) has been measured via the decay @xmath30 at fermilab@xcite .",
    "the result indicates that @xmath0-mesons are not completely absorbed in the nuclear targets irrespective of the charge of the produced @xmath0-mesons . the theoretical analysis for the @xmath0-@xmath8 interaction will give an important suggestion for the experimental data in this case too .    motivated by these points",

    "it should be stressed that the qsr for vacuum correlation function @xmath74 up to dimension-6 operators can not reproduce well the @xmath0-meson mass ( @xmath143 ) in free space@xcite .",

    "furthermore , the curve of @xmath143 has rather larger change than that of @xmath121 in the region .",
    "therefore , if we perform the qsr analysis for the effective mass @xmath146 , the stability in the borel curve of @xmath147 will become obscure .",
    "this implies that the qsr analysis for @xmath147 is not so valid in this case",

    "it is noted the above results were performed at the nuclear matter density , @xmath154 , where @xmath155 is the normal matter density . assuming that the linear density approximation in the qsr is valid at the nuclear matter density , we find these results lead to a larger decrease of the @xmath0-meson mass than that of the charmonium .",
    "we also find that the large mass - shift of the @xmath0-meson originates from the contribution of @xmath156 term in the ope . in the qmc model",
    ", the contribution from the @xmath156 term may correspond to a quark-@xmath157 meson coupling .",
    "in fact , the model predicts the mass shift of the @xmath0-meson becomes @xmath158 mev for the scalar potential at the normal matter density @xcite .",
    "their results are very close to our results .",
    "we present an analysis of isospin - averaged @xmath0-meson mass - shift through a direct application of the borel qsr to the forward scattering amplitude of the pseudoscalar current and nucleon . here",
    "we perform the operator product expansion with all the terms up to dimension-4 .",
    "the result predicts an attractive mass - shift of the isospin - averaged @xmath0-meson about @xmath159 mev ( about @xmath160 of the bare mass ) at the normal matter density . the contribution of @xmath136 term in the ope is more than @xmath137 of the results evaluated up to all the dimension-4 operators .",
    "our result is very close to that reported by the qmc model@xcite .",
    "then the @xmath0-@xmath8 scattering length @xmath51 is about @xmath161 fm and indicates a strongly attractive force between the @xmath0-meson and nucleons .",
    "the mass modification of the @xmath0-meson in the nuclear matter corresponds to @xmath1 times larger than that of @xmath3 .",
    "recent na50 collaboration@xcite has reported a strong ( so called `` anomalous '' ) @xmath3 suppression@xcite in @xmath162-@xmath162 collision at @xmath163 gev per nucleon .",
    "we suggest a following possibility to cause such a strong @xmath3 suppression using the above large difference of the mass shifts between the @xmath0-meson and @xmath3 : suppose that the other @xmath16-states such as @xmath17 and @xmath164 s do not also have a large mass - shift in the nuclear matter as discussed above for @xmath3 .",
    "then on the basis of our calculations , the @xmath7 threshold ( @xmath165 gev in free space ) decreases by @xmath166 mev at @xmath167 and comes down between @xmath168 ( @xmath169 gev ) and @xmath17 ( @xmath170 gev ) . at @xmath171",
    ", it decreases by @xmath172 mev and comes down between @xmath173 ( @xmath174 gev ) and @xmath168 ( @xmath169 gev ) .",
    "such level crossings between the @xmath7 threshold and the charmonium spectrum are shown in fig.2 .",
    "it is well known from the @xmath29-@xmath28 collision data that only @xmath175 of @xmath3 observed are directly produced and the remainder comes from excited states ( @xmath164(@xmath176 ) , @xmath17(@xmath177 ) ) with a ratio of 3 to 1 @xcite .",
    "so if the disappearance of @xmath17 and @xmath164 due to their decays into @xmath7 takes place , it could lead to a decrease of the @xmath3 yield .",
    "this @xmath3 suppression will have stair - shaped form as a function of the energy density of the system . at low energy density ,",
    "only @xmath178 @xmath7 takes place , which causes a slight suppression of @xmath3 . at intermediate density ,",
    "subsequent suppression occurs by the level crossing of ( @xmath179 ) states with the @xmath7 threshold . at higher density , direct suppression of @xmath3 by the decay",
    "@xmath180 @xmath7 occurs .",
    "this is an alternative or supplementary effect to the deconfinement scenario in ref . and may have implications to the recent data of na50 collaboration@xcite . strictly speaking , as mentioned before , the formulation of qsr used here is applicable to dilute nuclear matter in comparison to highly dense nuclear matter produced in high energy heavy - ion collision .",
    "if we try to discuss the mass shifts at higher density , it will need an extension or some improvements in the above formulation .",
    "this is one of important future works for us .",
    "however we may say that our calculation in this paper can suggest a possibility of the level crossings even in only 1 or 2 times normal matter density and lets one expect the direct @xmath3 suppression at sufficiently higher density .",
    "we may also suggest another phenomenon caused by the level crossings discussed above .",
    "it is a change of the decay width of the charmonium . in the vacuum",
    "the resonances above @xmath7 threshold , for example the @xmath181 state , have a width of order mev because of the strong open - charm channel .",
    "on the other hand , the resonances below the threshold have a very sharp width of a few hundreds kev .",
    "so after the level crossings , the decay modes of the @xmath17 and @xmath164 states will change drastically at least one order of magnitude .",
    "needless to say , in the high energy heavy - ion collisions we must also perform the theoretical investigation of finite temperature effect @xcite to the mass modification .",
    "therefore , a future task will be to understand the medium effect in terms of the qsr when both temperature and density are finite . as for investigation of only the @xmath0-@xmath8 interaction",
    ", an inverse kinematics experiment will give useful information@xcite .",
    "since the projectile ( target ) is a heavy - ion beam ( light - nuclei ) , the decays of the @xmath0-meson @xcite and the charmonium inside a nucleus will be possible in such an experiment .    before closing",
    ", it is stressed that we should take the above analysis for the isospin - averaged @xmath0-@xmath8 interaction as a qualitative estimate .",
    "if we wish more quantitative discussion , the isospin - decomposition of the @xmath0-meson and higher correction terms beyond dimension-4 operators must be taken into account .",
    "particularly the odd - components in the ope play important roles for a difference of the mass shift between @xmath0 and @xmath182 .",
