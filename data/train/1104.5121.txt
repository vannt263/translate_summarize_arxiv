    "_ directed animals _ are a lattice model invented in 1982 by the physicists d. dhar , m. k. phani and m. barma @xcite . a _ heap of pieces _ is an object that gives a convenient geometric representation of a partially commutative monoid .",
    "heaps of pieces were invented in 1985 by the mathematician g. x. viennot @xcite .",
    "viennot also observed that directed animals are in bijection with _",
    "pyramids _ of _ dimers _ @xcite .",
    "( a pyramid is a heap having only one minimal piece and a dimer is a horizontal , one unit long line segment connecting two lattice points . ) _ stacked directed animals _",
    "are a superset of directed animals .",
    "stacked directed animals , as well as _",
    "multi - directed animals _ ( a superset of stacked directed animals ) , were defined in 2002 by m. bousquet - mlou and a. rechnitzer @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors begin with defining _ stacked pyramids _ and _ connected heaps _ ; connected heaps are a superset of stacked pyramids , which are , in turn , a superset of pyramids of dimers .",
    "then they define an injection ( say @xmath0 ) from connected heaps into polyominoes ; this injection is an extension of viennot s bijection . stacked directed animals are then defined to be the image of stacked pyramids under the injection @xmath0 , and multi - directed animals are defined to be the image of connected heaps under the injection @xmath0 .",
    "the purpose of this writing is to define stacked directed animals and multi - directed animals in a direct way , _",
    "i.e. _ , without using heaps of pieces . the original definition of directed animals does not involve heaps of pieces . in this sense ,",
    "our alternative definitions homologize stacked directed animals and multi - directed animals with directed animals .",
    "sure enough , these alternative definitions are equivalent to the definitions given by bousquet - mlou and rechnitzer .",
    "there are three regular tilings of the euclidean plane , namely the triangular tiling , the square tiling , and the hexagonal tiling .",
    "we adopt the convention that every square or hexagonal tile has two horizontal edges . in a regular tiling , a tile is often referred to as a _",
    "cell_. a plane figure @xmath1 is a _ polyomino _ if @xmath1 is a union of finitely many cells and the interior of @xmath1 is connected .",
    "see figure 1 .",
    "observe that , if a union of _ hexagonal _ cells is connected , then it possesses a connected interior as well .            given a polyomino @xmath1 , it is useful to partition the cells of @xmath1 according to their horizontal projection .",
    "each block of that partition is a _ column _ of @xmath1 .",
    "note that a column of a polyomino is not necessarily a connected set .",
    "an example of this is the highlighted column in figure  1 . on the other hand",
    ", it may happen that every column of a polyomino @xmath1 is a connected set . in this case",
    ", the polyomino @xmath1 is a _ column - convex polyomino_. see figure 2 .",
    "let @xmath5 and @xmath6 be two cells on the hexagonal lattice , and let @xmath5 be either the upper left neighbour of @xmath6 , or the upper neighbour of @xmath6 , or the upper right neighbour of @xmath6 .",
    "then we say that @xmath5 is a _",
    "generalized upper neighbour _ of @xmath6 .",
    "_ directed animals _ can be defined by recursion on the number of cells .",
    "the one - celled polyomino is a directed animal .",
    "let @xmath7 be a union of @xmath8 cells .",
    "then @xmath7 is a directed animal if and only if @xmath7 can be written as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a directed animal with @xmath11 cells , and @xmath5 is a generalized upper neighbour of some cell of @xmath10 .",
    "see figure 3 .",
    "let @xmath10 be a directed animal . among the cells of @xmath10 ,",
    "there exists exactly one cell which is not a generalized upper neighbour to any cell of @xmath10 .",
    "that special cell is called the _ source cell _ of @xmath10 .",
    "we say that a cell @xmath5 _ dominates _ over a cell @xmath6 if , for some @xmath14 , @xmath5 lies @xmath13 units above a generalized upper neighbour of @xmath6 .",
    "suppose that @xmath1 is a polyomino , that @xmath5 is a cell of @xmath1 , and that @xmath5 does not dominate over any cell of @xmath1 .",
    "then we say that @xmath5 is a _ source cell _ of @xmath1 . for directed animals , this definition of source cells is equivalent to the one given just above .",
    "let @xmath1 and @xmath2 be two polyominoes that have no cells in common .",
    "we say that @xmath1 _ dominates _ over @xmath2 if there exists a cell of @xmath1 which dominates over a cell of @xmath2 , but there does not exist a cell of @xmath2 which dominates over a cell of @xmath1 .",
    "* @xmath17 ; * for @xmath18 , the horizontal projection of the source cell of @xmath19 lies to the left of , and hence does not intersect with , the horizontal projection of the animal @xmath20 ; * however , for @xmath18 , the union @xmath21 dominates over the animal @xmath22 ; * for @xmath18 , the union @xmath21 and the animal @xmath22 have at least one edge in common .",
    "thus , stacked directed animals are a subset of multi - directed animals .",
    "see figures 4 and 5 .",
    "the multi - directed animal of figure 4 is not a stacked directed animal because @xmath23 does not dominate over @xmath24 .        for every multi - directed animal @xmath1 , the positive integer @xmath26 and the directed animals @xmath16 ( appearing in the definition of multi - directed animals ) are unique .",
    "namely , @xmath26 is the number of source cells of @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath27 stand for the leftmost source cell of @xmath1 , @xmath28 for the second - leftmost source cell of @xmath1 , and so on .",
    "then @xmath29 is the greatest instance of a directed animal which is contained in @xmath1 and has @xmath27 as the source cell ; @xmath30 is the greatest instance of a directed animal which is contained in @xmath31 and has @xmath28 as the source cell ; @xmath23 is the greatest instance of a directed animal which is contained in @xmath32 and has @xmath33 as the source cell , _ etc . _    every column - convex polyomino is a multi - directed animal ; this can be proved by induction on the number of columns . by way of example , in figure 6 , the column - convex polyomino of figure 2 is decomposed into three directed animals , and the decomposition has all the properties required in the definition of multi - directed animals .",
    "however , observe that the column - convex polyomino of figure 2 _ is not _ a stacked directed animal .",
    "likewise , there exist level one cheesy polyominoes that are not multi - directed animals .",
    "for example , if the level one cheesy polyomino of figure 7 were a multi - directed animal , then it would be a union of two directed animals ( because there are two source cells ) .",
    "the first directed animal would consist of the cells labeled by @xmath34 , and the second directed animal of the cells labeled by @xmath35 .",
    "the cell labeled by @xmath36 would not belong to any of the two directed animals , and hence would not belong to the cheesy polyomino . since the cell @xmath36 does belong to the cheesy polyomino , we have a contradiction .        on the other hand , there exist a lot of multi - directed animals and stacked directed animals which are not cheesy polyominoes . for example , none of the objects shown in figures 4 and 5 is a cheesy polyomino .",
