    "supergiant fast x - ray transients ( sfxt ) are detected as fast hard x - ray transients whose hour - long outbursts reach @xmath0@xmath1 erg s@xmath2 and whose spectra resemble those of accreting neutron stars ( ns ) .",
    "indeed , some sfxt are shown to have pulsations ranging from a few seconds to @xmath3s .",
    "this flaring gives sfxts quite a large dynamical range , which ranges between 3 and 5 orders of magnitude in flux .",
    "optical identification of the counterparts has led to classify sfxts as a peculiar class of high mass x ",
    "ray binaries ( hmxb ) , associated to a blue ( ob ) supergiant companion .",
    "we generally distinguish between confirmed and candidate sfxts based on the availability of an optical classification of the companion , and we now have 10 confirmed and as many candidate sfxts .",
    "the details of the physical origin of the outbursts are still unclear , but the ingredients that need to be taken into account include the properties of the wind from the supergiant companion @xcite and the presence of a centrifugal or magnetic barrier @xcite .",
    "since 2007 the sfxt project has performed an investigation of the properties of sfxts with _ swift _ , whose fast - slewing capability and broad - band energy coverage , combined with its flexible observing scheduling , make it an ideal facility to study both the bright outburst and the out - of - outburst behavior .",
    "our strategy pairs monitoring programs with outburst follow - ups ( see , e.g.   @xcite ) and has allowed us to catch several outbursts from most confirmed and several candidate sfxts ( see , e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) , to monitor them during their evolution , and to study the long term properties of this class of objects with a highly sensitive soft x  ray telescope .",
    "our long - term monitoring of 4 sfxts ( igr  j16479@xmath44514 , xte  j1739@xmath4302 , igr  j17544@xmath42619 , ax  j1841.0@xmath40536 ) has allowed us to determine that they spend 35% of the time in bright outbursts ; that their most probable flux level is f(210kev)@xmath5@xmath6 erg @xmath7 s@xmath2 ( unabsorbed , @xmath810@xmath9 erg s@xmath2 ) that their duty cycle of inactivity @xcite is in the range 1955% , so that these sources accrete matter for most of the time @xcite .",
    "[ fig1 ] and  [ fig2 ] illustrate our long - term monitoring for the two sxft prototypes , xte  j1739@xmath4302 and igr  j17544@xmath42619 ( up to @xmath10 mjd 55150 ) and how we keep observing bright outbursts also after the end of the campaign .",
    "2619 and subsequent outbursts .",
    "the downward - pointing arrows are 3@xmath11 upper limits .",
    "the upward - pointing arrows mark flares that triggered the bat transient monitor on mjd 54414 and 54906 . adapted from @xcite . ]    further monitoring programs aimed at sfxts with known orbital period .",
    "the first campaign was on igr  j18483@xmath40311 @xcite ( @xmath12d ) which we followed for a whole orbital period , thus allowing us to constrain the different mechanisms proposed to explain the sfxt nature .",
    "in particular , we applied the clumpy wind model for blue supergiants @xcite to the observed x - ray light curve . by assuming an eccentricity of @xmath13",
    ", we could explain the x - ray emission in terms of the accretion from a spherically symmetric clumpy wind , composed of clumps with different masses , ranging from @xmath14 to @xmath15 g .",
    "we also monitored igr  j16418@xmath44532 ( @xmath16d ) for three orbital cycles @xcite and could account for the observed emission with accretion from a spherically symmetric clumpy wind ( see , also @xcite ) .    among the most recent outbursts",
    "are those of xte  j1739@xmath4302 and igr  j17544@xmath42619 that triggered the _ swift_/bat on 2011 february 22 and march 24 , respectively ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , last peaks at @xmath10 mjd 55600 , @xcite ) and those of igr  j08408@xmath44503 @xcite .    in @xcite",
    ", we find that the spectra of both sources can be well fitted either with a two - blackbody model , or with a single unsaturated comptonization model . in the latter case , the model can be either a classical static comptonization model , such as , or the recently developed  model , which includes thermal and bulk comptonization for cylindrical accretion onto a magnetized neutron star .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a detailed description of the algorithm . here",
    "we briefly remind the reader that  is based on the solution of the radiative transfer equation for the case of cylindrical accretion onto the polar cap of a magnetized ns .",
    "the velocity field of the accreting matter can be increasing towards the ns surface , or it may be described by an approximate decelerating profile . in the former case ,",
    "the free parameters are the terminal velocity at the ns surface , @xmath17 , and the index of the law @xmath18 , while in the second case the law is given by @xmath19 .",
    "the other free parameters of the model are the temperature of the black - body seed photons , @xmath20 , the electron temperature and vertical optical depth of the comptonization plasma @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively , and the radius of the accretion column @xmath23 , in units of the ns  radius .",
    "the different combinations of these parameters determine the steepness of the spectrum at high energies and the rollover energy position .",

    "<S> supergiant fast x - ray transients ( sfxts ) are a class of high - mass x - ray binaries with possible counterparts in the high energy gamma rays . the _ swift _ sfxt project has conducted a systematic investigation of the properties of sftxs on timescales ranging from minutes to years and in several intensity states ( from bright flares , to intermediate intensity states , and down to almost quiescence ) . </S>",
