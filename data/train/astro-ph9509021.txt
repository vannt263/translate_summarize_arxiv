    "low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) are systems where a neutron star or black hole accretes material from a low mass ( m@xmath71m@xmath8 ) secondary ( see bhattacharya and van den heuvel 1991 ) .",
    "x - ray novae ( xrn ) form a subset of lmxbs whose properties are characterized by dramatic increases in flux ( factors of @xmath910@xmath1010@xmath11 ) at x - ray and radio energies on time scales of days , with a subsequent decay to quiescence on time scales of months .",
    "while these transients are in outburst , their x - ray and optical properties are very similar to those of the persistently bright lmxbs , where the optical flux is dominated by the reprocessed emission from the x - ray irradiated disk . in quiescence , however , the disk often fades to reveal the secondary star itself .",
    "this allows detailed photometric and spectroscopic measurements of the secondary to be made  otherwise impossible in the outburst state , and in most of the persistently bright lmxbs .",
    "studies of quiescent xrn are especially important for the following reasons .",
    "the frequency of black hole candidates among x - ray novae appears to be remarkably high ; 9 out of the 13 optically identified systems are strong or probable black hole candidates ( van paradijs and mcclintock 1995 ) .",
    "our understanding of the evolution of lmxbs ( eg , the progenitors , lifetimes , and numbers ) will be limited until we understand the nature of the transient sources .",
    "this is because the number of `` dormant '' transients may well exceed the number of persistent lmxbs by one to two orders of magnitude ( van den heuvel 1992 ) .",
    "the detection of the photospheric lines of the secondary in quiescent systems allows measurement of the orbital radial velocity curve , leading to firm lower limits on the mass of the accreting object .",
    "these measurements indicate masses  3 for the x - ray nova a0620 - 00 ( mcclintock and remillard 1986 ) , v404 cyg ( casares , charles and naylor 1992 ) nova muscae 1991 ( remillard , mcclintock and bailyn 1992 ) , nova ophiuci 1977 ( remillard 1995 ) , gro  j1655 - 40 ( bailyn 1995 ) , and gs2000 + 25 ( casares , charles and marsh 1995 ) . because the maximum mass for a stable neutron star is @xmath12 ( chitre and hartle 1976 ) these six xrn",
    "are regarded as strong black hole candidates .",
    "the mass ratio @xmath4 can be determined by combining the measurements of the orbital velocity of the secondary with similar measurements of emission lines originating in the accretion disk .",
    "models for formation of emission lines in accretion disks depend on many parameters , among them the inclination , inner and outer disk radii , and central object mass , and comparison to observed profiles can help to constrain some of these parameters",
    ".    in callanan 1995 ( paper  i ) we discussed the discovery of gro  j0422 + 32 , and presented the first results from our optical observing campaign during the outburst and decline . in this paper",
    "we present the results of extensive spectroscopic observations obtained @xmath13  days after outburst , when gro  j0422 + 32 had decayed to @xmath14 ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "our continuing photometric observations show that the source subsequently reached its quiescent level at day @xmath15 . the average intensity during days 760950 is @xmath16 ( 28  measurements ) and @xmath17 ( 3  measurements ) .",
    "we note that the error on the r  magnitude in quiescence quoted here is computed from the observed scatter in the data , and may be dominated by intrinsic variability in the source .",
    "the outburst amplitude was @xmath18 , which is the largest yet seen for an xrn : typical outburst amplitudes are @xmath19  magnitudes ( van paradijs and mcclintock 1995 ) .",
    "by 1993  october  10 , @xmath20 months after the initial outburst , gro  j0422 + 32 had reached @xmath21 ( day 430 on figure  [ r.long.lc ] ) , but was still at least @xmath22  magnitudes brighter than its quiescent level .",
    "this is surprising given that the black hole candidates nova muscae 1991 ( remillard , mcclintock and bailyn 1992 ) , gs2000 + 25 ( chevalier and ilovaisky 1990 ) , and v404 cyg ( casares and charles 1992 ) had reached quiescence within 14 months of the outburst .",
    "spectra of gro  j0422 + 32 were obtained with the sao whipple observatory mmt red channel spectrograph on 1993  october  10 and 12 ( ut ) , and spectra of several bright standards were obtained on october  11 ( ut ) for use in determining absolute radial velocities and spectral types .",
    "the spectra were obtained with a loral @xmath23  pixel ccd having 7  electrons read noise .",
    "the combination of the grating and @xmath24 slit gave @xmath25     fwhm spectral resolution and spectral coverage from @xmath26    through @xmath27   .",
    "the seeing on october  10 and 12 was predominantly @xmath28 and the skies were mostly clear , but occasional clouds and intervals of worse seeing ( @xmath29 ) compromised the photometric accuracy of our spectra .",
    "the cloud cover on october  11 was sufficiently heavy that only bright standards were visible on the tv guider ; however gro  j0422 + 32 was easily visible on the other two nights .",
    "the slit was approximately maintained at the parallactic angle in order to maximize throughput .",
    "twenty minute integrations of gro  j0422 + 32 were bracketed by short exposures of a hearne lamp for wavelength calibration purposes .",
    "data were reduced and analyzed using standard iraf routines .",
    "sixteen spectra were obtained on each night for a total exposure time of 640  minutes on gro  j0422 + 32 .",
    "simultaneous whipple observatory 1.2  m r  band photometry was obtained ; the instrumentation and data reduction are described in callanan 1995 .",
    "our primary goals were to detect the expected photospheric absorption lines due to the presumed late - type companion , and to measure the doppler shifts in those lines due to the expected orbital motion of the star .",
    "we attempted this by cross - correlating the 32  individual gro  j0422 + 32 spectra against the spectra of late - type dwarf templates , ranging from early k to mid  m , which were obtained with the identical instrumental setup on oct  11 . before cross - correlating",
    ", the regions around the 5577    and 5890  night - sky lines were replaced with a fit to the local continuum , because these night sky lines are strong enough to render subtraction in the individual 20  minute exposures problematic .",
    "in addition , the spectra were filtered in order to remove low - frequency features and in order to match the instrumental resolution of 5   .",
    "the low frequency filtering was achieved by subtraction of a @xmath30 order cubic spline fit to the continuum , and removal of wavenumbers @xmath31 from the fourier transform of the spectra ( ft ) .",
    "this effectively removes all features on scales larger than @xmath32 , including the instrumental response and possible tio bands ( see section 3.2 ) .",
    "the high frequency filter removed wavenumbers @xmath33 from the ft , which has the effect of smoothing the data on the intrinsic resolution of 5 ( @xmath34 pixels per resolution element ) . in order to avoid the contaminating effects of the h - balmer emission lines ,",
    "only the region between 5000    and 6500    was used for the correlations .",
    "we were not able to detect any narrow , late - type photospheric lines in this data set , despite extensive efforts . in order to quantify our lack of detection",
    ", we added various amounts of a late - type stellar spectrum ( with nad excised ) to our individual gro  j0422 + 32 spectra , and computed cross - correlations . in keeping with the short period",
    ", we added dwarf ( rather than giant ) spectra .",
    "when a m3v spectrum accounts for @xmath35% , a m0v for @xmath36 , or a k3v for @xmath37 of the total light , the correlations yield significant detections with r ( tonry and davis 1979 ) values in excess of 3.0 . in this way we estimate that the fractional contribution of any late - type stellar photosphere to the continuum light at @xmath21 is less than @xmath38 , @xmath39 , or @xmath40 for an assumed m3v , m0v or k3v companion , respectively .",
    "+      figure  [ oct.spec ] shows the sum of the spectra obtained on october  10  ( bottom ) and october  12  ( top ) .",
    "the most obvious features are double peaked h@xmath1 emission and interstellar nad  5890     absorption .",
    "the nad night sky line has not been excised because it is accurately subtracted in the summed spectrum , while the 5577   has once again been removed .",
    "the nad ew ( 1.2   ) is consistent with an interstellar origin . less obvious in figure  [ oct.spec ] are troughs in the continuum with minima at @xmath41   , @xmath42   , and @xmath43   . these troughs are more apparent in figure  [ oct.spec.bands ] , which shows a scaled plot of the october  10 gro  j0422 + 32 spectrum and a spectrum of a m3v  star .",
    "the correspondence in the broad continuum features leads us to suspect that something like an m  star photosphere is present in the spectra , even though cross - correlations show that the narrow lines expected from an m star are not detectable .",
    "we considered the possibility that these troughs might be an artifact of our data acquisition or reduction procedure ; however , spectra of the nova v849  oph ( @xmath44 ) which were taken on the same nights with the identical instrumental setup and reduced in the same way do not show these features .",
    "in addition , spectra taken by other observers a few months later also show evidence for bands indicative of a late - type stellar photosphere ( bonnet - bidaud and mouchet 1994 ) , although the lower s / n and resolution of these spectra make the bands difficult to detect .",
    "the evidence for these bands was much weaker in our spectra from october  12 .",
    "this may be because the s /",
    "n in the october  12 data was slightly lower than on october  10 ( see figure  [ oct.spec ] ) , or it may be that the band strength is variable and the @xmath45  magnitude brightening on october  12 is related to their weaknesses .",
    "we therefore concentrate solely on the october  10 spectra for the remainder of this section .",
    "we measured the ew of the strongest two features ( at 5900 and 6200 ) and compared them to the ew in the m3v star spectrum .",
    "we choose to compare to an m3v star because it is a good match to the spectral type of gro  j0422 + 32 determined in quiescence , which is m2@xmath46v ( garcia 1994 , filippenko 1995 ) .",
    "the continuum points and band limits are defined by the m3v star , and are 5805-6039 and 6145-6350 , as marked on figure  3 .",
    "the ew of these bands in gro  j0422 + 32 are @xmath35 , while they are @xmath47 in the m3v star .",
    "thus we see that @xmath48 , or @xmath49% of the light may be due to an m3v star .",
    "an independent estimate of the amount of apparent m  star photosphere present in the spectra can be made by creating synthetic spectra consisting of the sum of an m3v star and an accretion disk , and looking for the best match to the gro  j0422 + 32 spectra .",
    "this method is sensitive to the slope of the continuum , whereas the previous method is sensitive only to the depth of the bands .",
    "we first de - reddened the gro  j0422 + 32 spectra for @xmath50 ( see callanan   1995 ) , and then sum variable amounts of an m3v star and an @xmath51 accretion disk spectrum .",
    "we choose a power law for the accretion disk spectrum because it is a sufficiently accurate representation of what has been seen in quiescent xrn .",
    "we measured the slope of the powerlaw from the published data on three xrn in quiescence .",
    "the results are shown in table  1 , along with the slope measured for gro  j0422 + 32 during the decay by shrader 1994 .",
    "we then assumed the slope for gro  j0422 + 32 was equal to the mean of the values in table  1 , but in order to determine the errors below we allowed @xmath1 to vary over the full range shown in the table .",
    "we then searched for the minimum @xmath52 between the observed and synthetic spectra w.r.t .",
    "the fraction ( @xmath53 ) of accretion disk .",
    "the minimum @xmath52 was not found to be unity , in part because the observed spectrum does not accurately match the narrow lines of the template m  star . in order to estimate an error range for our fit ,",
    "we re - scaled the error bars so that the best fit @xmath54 ( see shahbaz 1994 ) , and computed 68% confidence intervals at @xmath55 , ( avni 1976 ) . in the best fit synthetic spectrum , the m3v  star contributes between @xmath56 at 5000 and @xmath57 at 6500 , where the error ranges include the a contribution due to the range in slopes found in table  1 .",
    "given the rather substantial errors associated with measuring the contribution based on the slope of the continuum , we see that both measurements are consistent with the assumption that an m3v star photosphere contributed 20% of the light in october  1993 , when @xmath58 .",
    "this is marginally consistent with our lack of a result from the cross - correlations , as we would need @xmath59% of the light to be due to a late - type stellar photosphere in order to obtain reliable cross - correlation results .",
    "+      the double peaked h@xmath1 profiles shown in figure  [ oct.spec ] are similar to those seen in cataclysmic variables , where they are believed to arise because of doppler shifts in an accretion disk around the compact object ( smak 1981 , horne & marsh 1986 ) . in order to test this hypothesis for gro  j0422 + 32",
    "we have fit model profiles appropriate for optically thin , flat , keplerian disks .",
    "the model and fitting methods are described in detail by smak 1981 and orosz 1994 .",
    "we restricted ourselves to models in which @xmath60 ( @xmath1 is the exponent of the radially dependent emission function ) , as this value is generally seen in dwarf nova disks in quiescence ( horne 1993 ) , and has also been found in xrn disks in quiescence ( johnson , kulkarni and oke 1989 , orosz 1994 ) .",
    "if we use other values for @xmath1 the results of our model fits might be different ( see figure 4 of johnson , kulkarni and oke 1989 ) , but by restricting ourselves to @xmath60 we allow direct comparison to previous work , in particular orosz 1994 .",
    "as the steady state smak model which we fit to the data predicts a symmetrical emission line profile , we begin by selecting 17 of our 32 spectra from october  10 and 12 such that the sum has red and blue peaks of equal amplitude .",
    "a sum of all 32  spectra produces a profile in which the blue peak dominates ( figure  [ oct.spec ] ) .",
    "this departure from symmetry might be explained by phase or time variable emission from an accretion disk hot spot seen in cvs and xrn ( johnson 1989 ) , or it might be due to poorly understood deviations from optically thin , keplerian models which have previously been noted in xrn ( orosz 1994 , haswell and shafter 1990 ) . we have not attempted to correct the average h@xmath1 profile for the possible effects due to the motion of the compact primary or the h@xmath1 absorption line expected from the secondary , as both of these effects are expected to be small in gro  j0422 + 32 and are typically ignored ( ie , johnson , kulkarni and oke 1989 , orosz 1994 ) . in any case , fits to the simple , symmetrical smak models will allow comparison of the gro  j0422 + 32 line profile to those seen in other xrn and cvs ( orosz 1994 , williams 1983 . )",
    "a first - order polynomial was fit to the 6350    ",
    "6750    region ( excluding h@xmath1 ) in order to subtract the continuum from the summed spectrum , and a chi - squared minimizing method was used to determine the best fit model parameters .",
    "the best fit parameters and 68% confidence intervals that we found are : @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 , were @xmath64 is the ratio of the radii of the inner and outer edges of the h@xmath1 emitting part of the disk , @xmath65 is the central wavelength of the profile , and @xmath66 is the velocity at the outer edge of the disk ( which is very nearly equal to 1/2 the separation of the peaks , see smak 1981 ) .",
    "a comparison of the data and best fit profile can be seen in figure  [ smak ] .",
    "+      because the h@xmath1 line forms in the accretion disk , one might expect that the line velocity reflects the motion of the compact object .",
    "measurement of this velocity should then determine the orbital period and mass function , @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the orbital period , @xmath69 is the semi - amplitude of the orbital velocity variation of the primary ( and of the h@xmath1 line by our assumption ) , @xmath70 is the mass of the companion , @xmath71 the mass of the compact star , and @xmath72 is the orbital inclination .",
    "the phase and mid - point ( @xmath73 velocity ) of the h@xmath1 velocity curve relative to that of the secondary provide checks on the validity of the assumption .",
    "studies of cvs ( eg , young , schneider and shectman 1981 , stover 1981 ) and xrn ( haswell and shafter 1990 hereafter hs90 , orosz 1994 , marsh , robinson , and wood 1994 , hereafter mrw94 ) show that @xmath69 determined from h@xmath1 emission lines is indicative of the velocity of the primary , even though the phase and @xmath73 of the h@xmath1 velocity curve are sometimes slightly offset from that expected",
    ".    however , the complex and variable shape of the h@xmath1 line makes it difficult to measure a velocity that reliably traces the motion of the compact object .",
    "several methods have been developed to help alleviate this problem , among them `` double gaussian fitting '' ( schneider and young 1980 , shafter 1983 , marsh 1994 ) and smak profile fitting ( orosz 1994 ) .",
    "we have employed a variant of these methods .",
    "a single gaussian is fit to the outer ( red and blue ) portion of the h@xmath1 line , excluding the central part of the line which can be affected by bright spot emission , optical depth effects , and other effects which may not reflect the motion of the compact object . in practice",
    "this outer portion is determined to be that portion in which the second derivative of the flux vs wavelength is @xmath74 as one approaches the line center . because this is the section of the line in which the profile is steepest ( the derivative is highest ) , its location is very sensitive to changes in the line velocity .",
    "we tested our method on data obtained for xrn muscae 1991 by orosz and collaborators in february  1993 , and we find values of @xmath69 and @xmath75 ( but not @xmath73 ) that are consistent with those derived by the double gaussian fitting and phase resolved smak profile fitting methods ( orosz 1994 ) .    in order to improve the s / n and search for radial velocity variations the individual 20  minute gro  j0422 + 32 spectra were grouped into 6 equal phase bins ( with 4 - 7 spectra in each bin ) based on the suggested period of @xmath76  hours , ( chevalier and ilovaisky 1994b ; we chose this period because it has the smallest error among the many consistent periods reported to date ) .",
    "for each profile a @xmath52 minimizing method was used to determine the central wavelength , width , and amplitude of a fitted gaussian and linear continuum model .",
    "the errors in the fitted parameters were determined by the rms to the fit .",
    "a sine curve with period fixed at 5.0944  hours was fitted to the velocities , which gave an amplitude @xmath77  and @xmath78 ( see figure  [ ha.vel]a ) . for comparison ,",
    "filippenko , matheson and ho ( 1995 ) find @xmath79and @xmath80 from recent observations in quiescence with the keck telescope .",
    "we adopt the phase convention of orosz 1994 and johnson 1989 , in which @xmath75 marks the closest approach of the compact object to the observer , and find @xmath81 .",
    "+      previous studies of interacting binaries have shown that the relative phasing of variations in emission line velocities , emission line ew , and wide - band photometry has the potential to reveal much about the geometry of a binary system ( eg , pringle and wade 1985 , mauche 1990 ) . in order to measure the ew of the h@xmath1 emission line",
    ", we fitted a low - order polynomial to the region around the emission line in each of the 32 spectra , in order to determine the continuum level . figure  [ ha.vel]b shows the resulting h@xmath1 ew vs the phase we determined above .",
    "we find that the ew is modulated by a factor of @xmath22 on the orbital period , varying between 20    and 40   .",
    "there is a broad minimum in the ew around phase 0.5 .",
    "we obtained 3  nights of r  band photometry with the sao 1.2  m telescope during october  1993 .",
    "two of these nights were simultaneous with the mmt spectra described herein , and are plotted vs phase in figure  [ ha.vel]c .",
    "these data are also shown in callanan 1995 , figure  3(d ) [ but note that they are labeled via mst dates , ie , october  9 and october  11 ] .",
    "the first seven measurements on october  12 are significantly ( @xmath82  magnitudes ) higher than the rest , indicating a flare - like event from gro  j0422 + 32 .",
    "we excluded these points from the analysis below .",
    "the solid line is the average magnitude in each of 12 phase bins .",
    "this average varies by 12% , and the mean rms in each of the 12 bins is 5% .",
    "there appears to be a broad maximum between phases 0.5 and 1.0 , with a slight indication of a local maximum around phase 0.5 .",
    "the apparently periodic modulation of the h@xmath1 ew and velocity reported herein agree with the suggested @xmath83  hour orbital period for gro  j0422 + 32 ( chevalier and ilovaisky 1994b ) , which has recently been confirmed by spectroscopic observations in quiescence ( orosz and bailyn 1994 , 1995 ; filippenko 1995 , casares 1995 ) .",
    "the lack of a detection of the secondary from our cross - correlation efforts indicates that the secondary contributed only a small fraction of the light during october  1993 . the fact that the system faded another 2  magnitudes since october  1993 by itself sets an upper limit of 16% to the contribution of the secondary in october  1993 .",
    "the non - detection is consistent with tests of the sensitivity of the cross - correlations to detecting the secondary in the individual 20  minute spectra , which show that we would need a contribution of @xmath84 for reliable detection ( section  3.2 ) .",
    "somewhat surprisingly the secondary does seem to be discernable in the grand sum spectrum , in that wide ( but weak ) m - star bands are seen in the spectrum .",
    "the measured strength of the bands may be somewhat larger than the 16% allowed contribution , however the errors in the measurement are large , and given the tendency to overestimate the strength of weak absorption features in noisy spectra it seems very likely that the bands are due to the m2v secondary .",
    "the accretion disk parameters ( and @xmath85 errors ) derived using the smak profile fits for gro  j0422 + 32 are compared to those derived for the xrn a0620 - 00 and x - ray nova muscae  1991 ( orosz 1994 ) in table  2 .",
    "we see that the @xmath64 values derived for a0620 - 00 and gro  j0422 + 32 are very similar , and are a factor of two larger than that found for nova muscae .",
    "interpreted in the context of the smak model , this indicates that the ratio of the inner to outer radii of the h@xmath1 emitting part of the disk is @xmath86 in a0620 - 00 and gro  j0422 + 32 , but @xmath20 in nova muscae .",
    "we can see in figure  [ ha.vel ] that the h@xmath1 ew decreases by @xmath87 at phase 0.5 , about the same time that the r  band photometry increases by @xmath88 .",
    "the relative amplitude of the ew and r  band variations shows that only a small part of the the h@xmath1 ew variations can be due to variations in the continuum .",
    "casares ( 1995 ) also find a @xmath89% orbital modulation in the h@xmath1 ew of gro  j0422 + 32 in data taken in quiescence .",
    "this variation is in marked contrast to that seen in a0620 - 00 ( mrw94 ) and v404 cyg ( casares and charles 1992 , casares 1993 ) , in which the h@xmath1 ew modulation is largely explained by modulation in the underlying continuum .",
    "the h@xmath1 velocities imply that the secondary is closest to the observer when the ew is smallest , which suggests that the ew variations may be due to an eclipse of the disk by the secondary . however , this is untenable for a simple azimuthally symmetric disk .",
    "the problem is that any eclipse would have to cover @xmath87 of the h@xmath1 emitting region while at the same time the overall r  band continuum ( which must be due almost entirely to the disk ) peaks .",
    "it is perhaps more likely that the ew variations are due to variations in the projected geometry and integrated emissivity of the disk itself , for example due to an azimuthally varying disk thickness .",
    "we searched for , and found , orbital radial velocity variations in the h@xmath1 emission line .",
    "such variations often measure the motion of the compact object in sxt ( orosz 1994 , hs90 , mrw94 ) . in the particular case of gro  j0422 + 32 , we can check to see if this velocity variation is consistent with the compact object by comparing the @xmath73 velocity and phase to those measured for the secondary .",
    "we find a central velocity of @xmath78 for the h@xmath1 line in gro  j0422 + 32 , which is not consistent with velocity of the secondary of @xmath90(filippenko 1995 ) .",
    "however , the @xmath73 velocities derived from sxt h@xmath1 studies are somewhat problematic .",
    "the values derived depend strongly on the details of the function used to fit the line ( ie , hs90 , orosz 1994 ) .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that different methods lead to different results . in the best studies system , a0620 - 00",
    ", orosz find @xmath91 via smak profile fitting , but @xmath92 via double gaussian fitting .",
    "even when consistent methods are used , the h@xmath1 @xmath73 in a0620 - 00 appears to change from year to year , perhaps because of variations in the shape of the h@xmath1 profile ( using double gaussian fitting , hs90 find @xmath93 in dec 89/jan 90 , orosz find @xmath94 in jan 91/feb 91 , and mrw94 find @xmath95 in dec 91/jan 92 ) .",
    "one is lead to the conclusion that h@xmath1  @xmath73 velocities are not robust measures of the binary systemic velocity , and that in the case of gro  j0422 + 32 our measurement of @xmath96 argues neither strongly for nor against the assumption that the h@xmath1 velocity variations ( @xmath69 ) are representative of the compact object .",
    "however , even given the problematic nature of the h@xmath1 @xmath73 velocities , it appears that h@xmath1 @xmath69 velocities are accurate , in that they yield results which agree with those determined by independent methods ( orosz 1994 , mrw94 ) .",
    "the orbital period of gro  j0422 + 32 is not presently known with sufficient accuracy to compare the phase of the secondary radial velocity curve measured in quiescence ( filippenko 1995 , casares 1995 ) to the h@xmath1 curve we measured in october 1993 .",
    "however , the large h@xmath1 ew variations , seen once per orbital cycle , might provide an accurate fiducial mark .",
    "if one assumes this variation is stable with respect to the orbital phase , then we can use the ew curve to compare our h@xmath1 velocities to those measured for the secondary .",
    "comparing our figure  5  a / b to figure  1 of casares ( 1995 ) , we see that the peak of the h@xmath1 ew modulation occurs when the h@xmath1 velocity crosses from blue to red , and the secondary velocity crosses from red to blue .",
    "this is the phasing expected if the h@xmath1 velocities track the compact object .    by combining our measurement of the velocity semi - amplitude of the primary ( @xmath97  ) with the recently determined velocity semi - amplitude of the secondary ( @xmath98  , filippenko 1995 ) we can determine the mass ratio @xmath99 .",
    "this mass ratio , while extreme , is similar to that found in other xrn and reinforces the idea that xrn as a class may have mass ratios extreme enough to excite su  uma type superhumps in outburst ( callanan and charles 1991 , bailyn 1992 ) .",
    "indeed , superhumps during outburst have been reported for gro  j0422 + 32 ( kato , mineshige and hirata 1995 ) .",
    "the mass function sets a lower limit to the mass of the compact object of @xmath100 ( filippenko 1995 ) .",
    "when we use our estimate of the mass ratio ( and the definition of the mass function ) we find the lower limit is raised to @xmath101 .",
    "the corresponding lower limit to the mass of the secondary is @xmath102 .",
    "a reasonable upper limit on the mass of the secondary might be derived from the empirical mass / period relation found for secondaries in cvs by patterson ( 1984 ) .",
    "we feel this is an upper limit because studies of cen  x-4 , for example , show that the secondary in this x - ray binary is substantially undermassive ( remillard and mcclintock 1990 ) .",
    "for the 5.1  hour period of gro  j0422 + 32 , patterson s relation predicts @xmath103 . given",
    "the @xmath4  found above , this translates into an upper limit for the mass of the compact object of @xmath104 , and ( through the mass function ) a lower limit to the inclination of @xmath105 .",
    "the lack of optical and x - ray eclipses sets an upper limit to the inclination of @xmath106 at the observed mass ratio ( chanan , middleditch , and nelson 1976 ) .",
    "the rather modest orbital modulation of the lightcurve compared to that seen in other xrn favors the lower end of the allowed range in @xmath72 , and therefore the higher end of the allowed range in @xmath71 .",
    "we note that the @xmath4 and @xmath71 we find are consistent with those determined from the observations of superhumps during outburst by kato ( 1995 ) .",
    "however detailed modeling of the lightcurve ( eg haswell 1993 ) will be necessary to further constrain @xmath72 , @xmath4 , and @xmath71 .",
    "we thank the staff at the mmto for their outstanding level of support , and the multitude of observers at the wo 1.2  m telescope who helped collect the extensive light curve of gro  j0422 + 32 .",
