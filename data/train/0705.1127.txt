    "the ginzburg - landau parameter of a superconductor , @xmath0 , is generally defined as the ratio of its magnetic penetration depth ( @xmath1 ) to its coherence length ( @xmath2 ) at the thermodynamical critical temperature ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the parameter relates the two fundamental length scales of the material s superconducting phase , distinguishes whether the phase transition is first- or second - order , and characterizes the material s response to applied magnetic fields in the superconducting state .",
    "theoretically , for clean materials , it is given by the bcs @xmath0 = 0.96 @xmath4(0)/@xmath5 where @xmath4(0 ) is the london penetration depth at zero temperature and @xmath5 is the pippard coherence length @xcite .",
    "the parameter , although often referred to , is infrequently measured and little tabulated owing to its dependence on sample purity and structure . where measured ,",
    "@xmath0 has been determined @xcite from independent measurements of @xmath1 and the thermodynamic critical field @xmath6 , as well as from magnetization measurements on thin films and foils of various materials @xcite . for type - i materials",
    "( @xmath7 1/@xmath8 ) , another technique has been from measurements of the supercritical fields of microspheres .",
    "this technique has been used in determining the @xmath0 of aluminum @xcite , cadmium @xcite , gallium @xcite , mercury @xcite , indium @xcite , lead @xcite , tin @xcite , thallium @xcite and zinc @xcite , as well as a series of alloys @xcite .",
    "inexplicably , the results are generally @xmath9 factor 2 smaller than the thin film / foil determinations as well as the bcs - defined @xmath0 , as shown in table i. more recent measurements , using a fast pulse induction technique with thin foils , provide results in better agreement with those from the microspheres @xcite .",

    "the supercritical fields determinations of all reports are obtained from hysteresis curves of the first order tin and indium transitions .",
    "different reports have however assumed different definitions of the critical fields within the hysteresis curves , as shown schematically in fig .",
    "5 . as evident",
    ", these definitions alone can lead to an appreciable variation in the reported @xmath10 . in general , the @xmath11 , @xmath12 parameters of fm should be consistently higher than sbc , which is not observed in the case of fm @xmath11 .",
    "in the case of single grain measurements , variations in the supercritical fields arise mainly from the grain metallurgy .",
    "fm performed careful investigations of defects as part of their study .",
    "the hysteresis curves were measured as a function of the orientation of the spheres in the applied field , and the @xmath11 , @xmath12 taken from the direction yielding the lowest values ( i.e. highest @xmath13 , lowest @xmath14 ) .",
    "the results are strongly dependent on @xmath3 . in principle , for @xmath15 , the coherence length is sufficiently large that these effects are negligible ; at lower temperatures , the coherence length is smaller than the defect and the effects are more noticeable . for this reason ,",
    "fm also employed @xmath16 ( @xmath14/@xmath13)@xmath17 as a comparison for @xmath18 , which has the advantage of being insensitive to @xmath3 since it is independent of @xmath6 .    in the case of the suspension measurements ,",
    "the deformation of the hysteresis from the rectangular single sphere cycle is due largely to the interplay between defects and diamagnetic interactions between the spheres @xcite . at lower temperatures , defects in the sphere metallurgy",
    "may significantly reduce the superheating capacity of the material , resulting in a lowered transition field such as observed in the indium data of sbc . however , the defects should also serve as nucleation centers for `` early '' normal ( n ) @xmath19 superconducting ( s ) transitions at lower temperatures , which is not observed . on the other hand",
    ", the advantage of the multisphere measurement lies in the averaging over the defect contribution - the last sphere to transition to the normal state is the most defect - free sphere of the suspension .    the recent work of pearanda et .",
    "@xcite has demonstrated significant diamagnetic interactions even for filling factors as small as 5% .",
    "these may vary from one suspension to another of the same material as a result of inhomogeneous distributions .",
    "although the last sphere to transition in the s @xmath19 n case is effectively free of diamagnetic interactions , this is not true for the n @xmath19 s where diamagnetic interactions are a maximum .",
    "as the field decrease continues , the new n @xmath19 s transitions enhance the local diamagnetic contribution to the local fields of those spheres still normal .",
    "this would suggest that the @xmath18 determinations with suspensions are lower than actual by some amount proportional to the diamagnetic interactions , since the local field is higher . as seen in fig .",
    "1(a ) , the sbc h@xmath20 for tin is essentially the same as those of the fm single sphere",
    ". for indium however , the sbc @xmath21 are systematically lower than those of fm by @xmath9 10% for @xmath22 0.8 .",
    "hysteresis curve schematic , indicating the various field definitions for @xmath13 , @xmath14 employed by sbc and fm.,width=8 ]    all results were moreover obtained by variation of the magnetic field , rather than temperature , which as shown by chaddah and roy @xcite results in an enhanced @xmath21 , apart from any diamagnetic interaction , as a result of the thermal fluctuations induced by the field changes themselves .",
    "the variation of @xmath0 with temperature suggests a variation of the transition order with temperature , which has possibly important ramifications since @xmath0 is then less a fundamental property of the superconductor than a simple ratio between the two characteristic lengths in the description , both of which vary with temperature and yield results consistent with the observed @xmath0 determinations .",
    "variation of the order of the transition with the temperature is predicted in recent renormalization - based reformulations of basic superconductive theory @xcite , which include fluctuations in the involved gauge and scalar fields , and result in a dividing line between type - i and -ii behavior at @xmath23 with a magnetic response which can be varied between type - i and type - ii simply by temperature change .",
    "this variation has been seen in magnetization measurement of nitrogen - doped ta ( @xmath0 = 0.665 ) @xcite , but is otherwise unconfirmed .",
    "reexamination of previous ginzburg - landau parameter determinations from superheating field measurements of microspheres of tin and indium shows the long - standing discrepancy in reported @xmath24 of tin to derive from the different analyses methods employed , rather than whether single- or multi - grain determinations , or grain metallurgy .",
    "although the tin results of sbc can be made to agree with those of fm ( and larrea et .",
    "al . ) , the customary analyses via eq . ( 2 ) is in disagreement with that performed numerically .",
    "this is not the case of indium , where the discrepancy reflects severe differences in the supercritical field measurements themselves .",
    "the similar reexamination of the supercooling field measurements uncovers no divergences capable of explaining the discrepancies with the measurements of ref .",
    "@xcite . to the contrary ,",
    "the variation of @xmath14 with @xmath25 appears to confirm the latter , raising severe questions as to the true significance of @xmath0 as a descriptor of superconductors .",
    "the resolution of these is however beyond the scope of this work .",
    "the available @xmath26 1 data is of insufficient precision to permit more than suggestions as to @xmath0 .",
    "analyses of all superheating results via the pad approximation yields a convergence of @xmath24 , @xmath18 to @xmath0 , with values for each material only slightly different from those previously reported on the basis of @xmath21 alone .",
    "these previous results however are likely larger than actual as a result of diamagnetic interactions between the superconducting sphere population . apart from nonlocal effects ,",
    "the large @xmath11 for @xmath26 0.8 is likely due to defect presence , which causes nucleation of the normal state to occur at fields below the maximal @xmath27 .",
    "these become unimportant as @xmath28 1 , increasing @xmath13 and generating a rapid drop in @xmath11 .    whether the proper analyses is by eq .",
    "( 2a ) , numerical or pad remains in question . nevertheless , all of the materials analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( tin , indium , thallium , lead and mercury ) follow from the sbc fig . 1 ; in contrast , the analyses of the remaining refs . has proceeded via eq .",
    "( 2 ) , which is seen to underestimate the respective @xmath10 . in view of the significance of the ginzburg - landau parameter ,",
    "the uncertainties inherent to this technique and the variation in experimentally - obtained results , and technological advances over the last thirty years , careful remeasurements of the supercritical fields over the full temperature range , and their analysis within a definitive description of the @xmath29 plane , would seem to be indicated .    the discrepancy in @xmath0 between spheres and thin film / foil determinations has been known for some decades , but to the best of our knowledge remains unexplained .",
    "the thin film / foil results are in fact a factor @xmath9 1.7 larger than those from the microspheres ; they are also in better agreement with @xmath0 derived from @xmath30 via @xmath31 , and also agree in general with the lower temperature results of the microspheres .",
