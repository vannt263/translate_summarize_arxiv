    "the classical approach of mathematical finance is to consider that the prices of basic products ( future , stock ,  )",
    "are observed on the market . in particular , their values",
    "are used in order to price complex derivatives .",
    "since options traders typically rebalance their portfolio once or a few times a day , such derivatives pricing problems typically occur at the daily scale .",
    "when working at the ultra high frequency scale , even pricing a basic product , that is assigning a price to it , becomes a challenging issue .",
    "indeed , one has access to trades and quotes in the order book so that at a given time , many different notions of price can be defined for the same asset : last traded price , best bid price , best ask price , mid price , volume weighted average price,  this multiplicity of prices is problematic for many market participants .",
    "for example , market making strategies or brokers optimal execution algorithms often require single prices of plain assets as inputs .",
    "choosing one definition or another for the price can sometimes lead to very significantly different outcomes for the strategies .",
    "this is for example the case when the tick value ( the minimum price increment allowed on the market ) is rather large .",
    "indeed , this implies that the prices mentioned above differ in a non negligible way .    in practice",
    ", high frequency market participants are not looking for the  fair \" economic value of the asset .",
    "what they need is rather a price whose value at some given time summarizes in a suitable way the opinions of market participants at this time .",
    "this price is called _",
    "efficient price_. hence , this paper aims at providing a statistical procedure in order to estimate this efficient price .      in this paper , we focus on the case of large tick assets . we define them as assets for which the bid - ask spread is almost always equal to one tick .",
    "our goal is then to infer an efficient price for this type of asset .",
    "naturally , it is reasonable to assume that the efficient price essentially lies inside the bid - ask spread but we wish to say more .    in order to retrieve the efficient price ,",
    "the classical approach is to consider the imbalance of the order book , that is the difference between the available volumes at the best bid and best ask levels , see for example @xcite . indeed , it is often said by market participants that  the price is where the volume is not \" .",
    "here we consider a dynamic version of this idea through the information available in the _ order flow_. more precisely , we assume that the intensity of arrival of the limit order flow at the best bid or the best ask level depends on the distance between the efficient price and the considered level : if this distance is large , the intensity should be high and conversely .",
    "thus , we assume the intensity can be written as an increasing deterministic function of this distance .",
    "this function is called the _ order flow response function_. in our approach , a crucial step is to estimate the response function in a non parametric way . then",
    ", this functional estimator is used in order to retrieve the efficient price .",
    "note that it is also possible to use the buy or sell market order flow . in that case",
    ", the intensity of the flow should be high when the distance is small . indeed ,",
    "in this situation , market takers are not loosing too much money ( with respect to the efficient price ) when crossing the spread .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the model and the assumptions are described in section [ mod ] .",
    "particular properties of the efficient price are given in section [ effpr ] and the main statistical procedure is explained in section [ stat ] .",
    "the theorems about the response function can be found in section [ thh ] and the limiting behavior of the estimator of the efficient price is given in section [ theffpr ] .",
    "one numerical illustration can be found in section [ num ] and a conclusion is given in section [ conclu ] .",
    "finally the proofs are relegated to section [ proofs ] .",
    "we assume the tick size is equal to one , meaning that the asset can only take integer values .",
    "moreover , the efficient price is given by @xmath0,\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is a brownian motion on some filtered probability space @xmath2 and @xmath3 is a @xmath4-measurable random variable , independent of @xmath5 and uniformly distributed on @xmath6 , with @xmath7 .",
    "note that such a simple dynamics for the efficient price is probably still reasonable at our high frequency scale .",
    "let @xmath8 be the fractional part of @xmath9 , denoted by @xmath10 , that is : @xmath11 to fix ideas and without loss of generality , we focus in the rest of the paper on the limit order flow at the best bid level . we assume that when a limit order is posted at time @xmath12 at the best bid level , its price @xmath13 is given by @xmath14 .",
    "therefore at time @xmath12 , the efficient price is @xmath15    we denote by @xmath16 the total number of limit orders posted over @xmath17 $ ] . in order to translate the fact that the intensity of @xmath18 should be an increasing function of @xmath19",
    ", we assume that @xmath20 is a cox process ( also known as doubly stochastic poisson process ) with arrival intensity at time @xmath12 given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a positive constant and where the response function @xmath23 satisfies the following assumption :    [ [ assumption - h1-response - function ] ] assumption h1 : response function + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the function @xmath24 is @xmath25 on @xmath26 , with derivative @xmath27 for which there exist some positive constants @xmath28 and @xmath29 such that for any @xmath30 in @xmath26 , @xmath31 moreover , we have the following identifiability condition : @xmath32    remark that h1 implies in particular that @xmath24 is bounded on @xmath26 .",
    "the response function expresses the influence of the efficient price on the order flow .",
    "in particular , the limiting case where @xmath24 is constant corresponds to orders arriving according to a standard poisson process . this simple arrival mechanism is often assumed in practice for technical convenience , see for example @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however , it is not very realistic .",
    "nevertheless , it is clear that our model is still probably too simple , @xmath19 being the only source of fluctuation of the intensity .",
    "for example , a more reasonable version should probably allows for seasonalities in the flow and the possible influence of exogenous variables .",
    "we assume that we observe the point process @xmath33 on @xmath34 $ ] . to get asymptotic properties , we let @xmath35 tend to infinity .",
    "it will be also necessary to assume that @xmath36 depends on @xmath35 .",
    "more precisely , we have the following assumption :    [ [ assumption - h2-asymptotic - setting ] ] assumption h2 : asymptotic setting + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    for some @xmath37 , as @xmath35 tends to infinity , @xmath38    note that up to scaling modifications , we could also consider a setting where @xmath35 is fixed and the tick size is not constant equal to @xmath39 but tends to zero .",
    "the intensity of the order flow is @xmath40 .",
    "this process @xmath41 has several nice properties .",
    "first , recall that if @xmath42 is uniformly distributed on @xmath43 $ ] and @xmath44 is a real - valued random variable , which is independent of @xmath42 then @xmath45 is also uniformly distributed on @xmath43 $ ] .",
    "thus , since @xmath46 is uniformly distributed on @xmath43 $ ] , we obtain that @xmath47 is a stationary markov process .",
    "then , from the properties of the sample paths of the brownian motion , it is clear that @xmath47 is harris recurrent and therefore , for @xmath48 a bounded positive measurable function , almost surely , @xmath49 see for example theorem 3.12 in @xcite .      beyond the markov property ,",
    "the process @xmath47 also enjoys a regenerative property .",
    "we define the sequence of stopping time @xmath50 the following way : @xmath51 , @xmath52 and for @xmath53 : @xmath54the cycles @xmath55 are independent and identically distributed for @xmath56 .",
    "thus @xmath57 is a regenerative process .",
