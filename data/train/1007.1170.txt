    "<S> hawking - bekenstein entropy formula seems to tell us that no quantum degrees of freedom can reside in the interior of a black hole . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that this is a consequence of the fact that the volume of any interior sphere of finite surface area simply vanishes . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , this is not the case in general relativity . </S>",
    "<S> however , we show that such a phenomenon does occur in various gravitational theories which admit a spontaneously induced general relativity . in such theories , due to a phase transition ( one parameter family degenerates ) which takes place precisely at the would have been horizon , the recovered exterior schwarzschild solution connects , by means of a self - similar transition profile , with a novel hollow interior exhibiting a vanishing spatial volume and a locally varying newton constant . </S>",
    "<S> this constitutes the so - called hollowgraphy driven holography .    the hawking - bekenstein@xcite black hole entropy formula @xmath0 constitutes a triple point in the phase space of physical theories . </S>",
    "<S> this formula touches gravity , even beyond general relativity ( gr ) , quantum mechanics , and statistical mechanics ; and thus , is expected to play a major role in ( the still at large ) quantum gravity . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast with ordinary macroscopic systems , whose entropy is known to be proportional to their volume @xmath1 , the entropy of a black hole is intriguingly proportional to the surface area @xmath2 of the event horizon . </S>",
    "<S> following conventional statistical mechanics wisdom , this seems to tell us that , from some fundamental as yet obscure reason , no degrees of freedom can reside within the interior of a black hole . </S>",
    "<S> recall that the gibbons - hawking@xcite derivation of eq.([sbh ] ) does not make use of the black hole interior . </S>",
    "<S> also walds@xcite derivation , being more locally oriented , solely invokes geometrical properties of the horizon itself , but without addressing the interior regime .    </S>",
    "<S> the area entropy has inspired the holographic principle@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the latter , primarily introduced by t hooft@xcite to resolve the black hole information paradox , has been further developed by susskind@xcite , gaining theoretical support from the ads / cft duality@xcite . however , in spite of the impressive theoretical progress , a basic question is still to be answered . </S>",
    "<S> namely , why is the black hole entropy proportional to the area of the black hole horizon rather than to its volume ? </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , gr per se does not provide an explanation . </S>",
    "<S> given the schwarzschild solution , and owing to the @xmath3 signature flip , the volume of any sphere of a finite surface area is problematic@xcite . but </S>",
    "<S> even if @xmath4 would have been well behaved , then following a conventional asymptotic expansion@xcite @xmath5 , either the coefficient @xmath6 , or @xmath4 itself , must vanish for the area term to dominate the entropy . unfortunately , as far as gr is concerned , the exterior schwarzschild solution refuses to connect with an interior core of zero volume . </S>",
    "<S> however , if gr is not the final word , and is either ( i ) a limit of a more sophisticated theory of gravity , or even ( ii ) just supplemented by various field theoretical corrections , things can change drastically . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we raise the intriguing possibility that the surface contribution to the black hole entropy prevails simply because any inner sphere , while being characterized by a finite surface area @xmath7 , happens to exhibit a vanishing volume @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> we refer to such a idea as hollowgraphy driven holography .    </S>",
    "<S> serendipitously , the realization of such an idea only calls for a slight deviation from gr , parametrized by some small parameter @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> whereas the exact schwarzschild solution is fully recovered for @xmath10 , the 1-parameter family of solutions degenerates ( this is also known as level crossing ) as @xmath11 , precisely on the would have been event horizon , with the recovered exterior schwarzschild solution being analytically connected now with a novel interior core . </S>",
    "<S> horizon phase transition has already been discussed in the literature@xcite , and so was the idea that quantum effects may prevent black holes from forming , and instead give rise to black stars@xcite . however , a @xmath12 black hole / star configuration has never been demonstrated .    </S>",
    "<S> to concretize the idea , let us first add a simple curvature quadratic to the einstein - hilbert action @xmath13 note that such a term can arise from quantum corrections@xcite . while facing gr for @xmath14 , </S>",
    "<S> it is incorrect to assume that adding higher derivative correction terms , e.g. @xmath15 gravity@xcite , with small coefficients will only produce small modifications of the solutions of the unperturbed theory . to provide extra insight , notice that the above action is equivalent@xcite to a certain @xmath16 ( or @xmath17 using the palatini formalism ) </S>",
    "<S> brans - dicke ( bd ) theory@xcite supplemented by a quartic higgs type potential @xmath18 with @xmath19 we remark that ( i ) an arbitrary @xmath20 bd scalar kinetic term can be added without affecting our main conclusion , and that ( ii ) the scalar field @xmath21 is dynamical even in the absence of such a kinetic term . </S>",
    "<S> the role of the potential is to allow , by virtue of the zee@xcite mechanism , for the spontaneous emergence of gr once the bd scalar approaches its vev , that is @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that the matter lagrangian @xmath23 does not couple to the bd scalar elevates the jordan frame , rather than the einstein frame , to the level of the physical frame .    </S>",
    "<S> associated with a static spherically symmetric line element @xmath24 are the field equations ( using the notation @xmath25 ) @xmath26 the scalar field equation @xmath27 , which is a certain combination of the above equations , will play an essential role in regions where the newton constant is away from its vev . </S>",
    "<S> the asymptotically flat , large distance ( and small mass ) expansion is quite conventional , with the scalar charge @xmath9 factorizing a variety of yukawa suppressed terms at a typical length scale @xmath28 , namely @xmath29 where the various functions involved exhibit the long distance behavior @xmath30 the schwarzschild solution is fully recovered , not just asymptotically , for @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> however , with the focus on the @xmath32 limit , one can numerically run a full scale solution , see fig.[fig1 ] , and already suspect the emergence of a phase transition at the would have been horizon . while the exterior schwarzschild solution is asymptotically recovered , it is clear that as far as the inner core is concerned , ( i ) the @xmath33 signature flip is gone , ( ii ) @xmath34 get drastically suppressed , and ( iii ) the effective newton constant @xmath35 ceases to be constant .    . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath36 solution ( red ) vs. the @xmath31 schwarzschild solution ( blue ) . at the limit @xmath37 </S>",
    "<S> a phase transition occurs on the would have been horizon ( at @xmath38).,title=\"fig : \" ] . the @xmath36 solution ( red ) vs. the @xmath31 schwarzschild solution ( blue ) . at the limit @xmath37 a phase transition occurs on the </S>",
    "<S> would have been horizon ( at @xmath38).,title=\"fig : \" ]    to isolate the new geometrical branch which enters the game , we momentarily neglect the @xmath39 terms in the field equations ( the consistency of this approximation is later verified ) to face the exact short distance analytic behavior @xmath40 with the emerging constant of integration @xmath41 being apparently arbitrary at this stage . </S>",
    "<S> however , noticing that @xmath42 , and owing to the @xmath43 behavior at short distances , it becomes obvious that once the @xmath39 terms are to be re - introduced , then it is @xmath44 which becomes relevant fo the black hole / star . </S>",
    "<S> the exact relation between @xmath41 and @xmath9 is generally quite complicated , and at this stage , was only obtained numerically by plotting @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> however , for the limiting case of a negligible scalar potential ( large @xmath46 ) , we find @xmath47 whereas this accounts for the small @xmath48 regime , it still lacks the physical scale where this behavior actually terminates to connect with the exterior branch ( where @xmath49 approaches the vev set by the potential ) .    to analytically derive the transition profile , we adopt the following technique . </S>",
    "<S> we only keep in the equations those terms which vary drastically at the neighborhood of the transition . in particular , it turns out that the transition profile is not sensitive to the terms involving the scalar potential @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> one equation of motion can then be integrated directly , leading to the conserved charge @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> this paves the way for the transitionary solution @xmath52 with @xmath53 serving as a parametric function , and @xmath54 as constants of integration . </S>",
    "<S> this solution allows for matching with both the exterior schwarzschild near horizon behavior as well as the interior solution specified earlier . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to fix @xmath55 , and to express the coefficients @xmath56 and also @xmath57 in terms of @xmath41 , namely @xmath58 the above solution admits a remarkable self - similar structure . </S>",
    "<S> namely , @xmath59 only causes scale changes @xmath60 and @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> the emerging transition profile then resembles , in some sense , the stretched horizon@xcite which characterizes the brane paradigm .    </S>",
    "<S> altogether , the inner metric is well approximated by @xmath62 notice that the effective newton constant ceases to be a constant in the inner core @xmath63 the fingerprint of the above metric is the invariant volume @xmath64 , associated with an inner sphere of a finite surface area @xmath65 , given by @xmath66     associated with a sphere of a surface area @xmath65 . the @xmath12 property can explain why no degrees of freedom reside inside a black hole / star . ]    for @xmath67 , @xmath64 is a smooth monotonically growing function of @xmath48 . for @xmath68 </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath64 vanishes inside , and starting from the would have been horizon , it grows until asymptotically approaching the @xmath69 value .    to gain insight at the neighborhood of the origin , </S>",
    "<S> one may re - define the radial coordinate @xmath70 and write the inner metric in the form @xmath71 the rindler structure of the temporal - radial part of the metric implies that the singularity in the origin is now protected by a pseudo - horizon. the imaginary time periodicity needed to avoid the associated conic singularity then implies , quite unexpectedly , that this pseudo - horizon exhibits the exact hawking temperature as the schwarzschild horizon .    </S>",
    "<S> the emerging picture is highly non - standard yet very pleasing . from the outside </S>",
    "<S> , an observer can not tell the hollow black hole geometry from the schwarzschild spacetime . </S>",
    "<S> however , due to a novel phase transition which takes place precisely at the would have been horizon , the recovered exterior schwarzschild solution connects , by means of a special self - similar transition profile , with a novel hollow interior . </S>",
    "<S> it is the @xmath12 property which can then account for the fact that no degrees of freedom can reside inside a black hole ( so that the black hole entropy is dominated by the finite @xmath72 ) , thereby constituting the so - called hollowgraphy driven holography . </S>"
