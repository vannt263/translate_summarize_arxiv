    "the determination of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix element @xmath4 from inclusive semileptonic @xmath6 decays suffers from large @xmath7 backgrounds . in most regions of phase space where this background is kinematically forbidden",
    ", the hadronic physics enters via unknown nonperturbative functions , so - called shape functions . at leading order in @xmath8",
    ", there is only one such function , which can be extracted from the photon energy spectrum in @xmath9  @xcite and used to predict various @xmath10 spectra . in @xmath9",
    "it is the main uncertainty in the effect of the cut on the photon energy , which is near the border of the region where a local operator product expansion ( ope ) is applicable . due to experimental cuts , the shape function is also important for @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "the determination of @xmath4 received renewed attention recently , since the measurement of @xmath12 favors a somewhat smaller value of @xmath4 than its determination from inclusive decays .",
    "one of the most sensitive tests of the standard model flavor sector comes from comparing the sides and angles of the unitarity triangle , so it is important to determine @xmath4 with minimal model dependence .",
    "refined calculations of the @xmath9 rate  @xcite also provide stringent constraints on new physics .    to obtain @xmath4 as precisely as possible",
    ", one should combine all existing information on the shape function .",
    "the shape function is constrained by the measurements of the shape of the @xmath9 photon energy spectrum  @xcite and the @xmath13 spectrum in @xmath3  @xcite , and its moments are related to the @xmath0 quark mass , @xmath14 , and nonperturbative matrix elements of local operators in the ope , which are constrained by fits to @xmath15 decay distributions  @xcite . in addition , the tail of the shape function as well as its renormalization group evolution ( rge ) can be calculated perturbatively .",
    "a problem is that an arbitrarily small renormalization group running of the shape function develops a perturbative tail whose moments diverge  @xcite .",
    "currently , there are several approaches to determine @xmath4",
    ". often a model for the shape function is chosen , which has a fixed functional form roughly consistent with the @xmath9 spectrum , and a few adjustable parameters that are fixed by imposing constraints on the first few moments of the shape function .",
    "a proposal  @xcite used by many experimental analyses involves defining moments of the shape function with a cutoff , and a particular procedure to attach a perturbative tail to the model .",
    "unfortunately , there is no clear way to disentangle the shape function and @xmath14 dependencies in this approach , and experimental uncertainties in the shape of the measured @xmath16 spectrum are not easily incorporated .",
    "the issues related to modeling the shape function can be avoided using model independent relations between @xmath10 partial rates and weighted integrals of the @xmath16 spectrum  @xcite , which use the measured @xmath9 spectrum directly as input to predict the @xmath3 rates .",
    "although this weighting method allows one to take into account the experimental uncertainties from @xmath16 straightforwardly , it is hard to combine several measurements , and there is no way to include the additional constraints on @xmath14 and the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) matrix elements .",
    "phase space cuts for which the rate has only subleading dependence on the shape function are also possible  @xcite , at the expense of increasing the size of the expansion parameter .",
    "a fully consistent method to combine all experimental constraints on both the shape and moments of the shape function , while also incorporating its known perturbative and nonperturbative behavior , has not yet been given .",
    "the framework proposed in this paper provides such a method .",
    "it also allows one to obtain reliable error estimates by ( i ) taking into account all experimental and theoretical uncertainties and correlations ; and ( ii ) estimating the uncertainty related to the unknown functional form of the shape function in a systematic fashion .",
    "the shape function , @xmath17 , contains nonperturbative physics and obeys the renormalization group equation @xmath18 where the evolution kernel @xmath19 sums logarithms between the two scales @xmath20 .",
    "the question is how to determine the function @xmath21 reliably , which can then be used to extract @xmath22 from @xmath3 , and to analyze @xmath9 or @xmath11 in the low-@xmath23 region . in ref .",
