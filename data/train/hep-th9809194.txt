    "in 1993 shuryak and verbaarschot realized @xcite that a certain chiral random matrix theory ( rmt ) is equivalent to the low - energy limit of the qcd partition function @xcite and thus rmt , a tool that had shown merit in such diverse areas of physics as atomic physics , solid state physics , and nuclear physics , entered the realm of quantum chromodynamics ( see @xcite for an extensive review of the many applications of rmt and @xcite for a review of the application of rmt to qcd ) .",
    "there is an amount of arbitrariness in the rmt of qcd since the potential @xmath3 that enters in the rmt partition function is arbitrary .",
    "it was shown @xcite that when @xmath4 then rmt and qcd are equivalent in the mesoscopic scaling region , also called the ( double-)microscopic limit .",
    "thus , if we want rmt to provide us with information about qcd in the microscopic limit we have to consider spectral correlators that are independent of @xmath3 in this limit .",
    "if this is the case the correlators are said to be universal .",
    "clearly , the question of universality is crucial if one wants to extract information about qcd from rmt .",
    "many papers have been written about the connection between rmt and 4-dimensional qcd ( qcd@xmath5 ) with an arbitrary number of flavors as well as 3-dimensional qcd ( qcd@xmath0 ) with an even number of flavors ( see references in @xcite ) . however , for an odd number @xmath6 of flavors the situation is less understood and only treated in @xcite .",
    "the reasons for this lack of balance are many .",
    "the rmt partition function is @xmath7 where we integrate over @xmath8 hermitian matrices @xmath9 with the haar measure .",
    "first of all , the effective field theory partition function , equivalent to ( [ zrmt ] ) when @xmath10 , depends on whether @xmath11 is even or odd @xcite : @xmath12 \\ \\ \\ \\ ( n{\\textrm { even } } ) \\\\",
    "\\label{oddpartfctnodd } { \\mathcal{z}}^{(2\\alpha+1)}_n & = & \\int { \\textrm{d } } u \\sinh \\ ! \\left [ { \\textrm{tr } } ( n    \\mathcal{m } u \\gamma_5 u^{\\dag } ) \\right]\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ ( n{\\textrm { odd}})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] both integrals are over su@xmath13 , @xmath14 is the mass matrix , and @xmath15 .",
    "the @xmath11-dependence is most peculiar .",
    "furthermore , the rmt spectral density @xmath16 obeys the relation @xcite @xmath17 which implies that for odd @xmath11 the spectral density is an odd function and thus not positive definite . finally , the standard method for calculating spectral information in random matrix theories , the method of orthogonal polynomials , is not available for an odd number of flavors due to the fact that it is impossible to define orthogonal polynomials with respect to an odd measure on an interval symmetric about the origin .",
    "in this paper we concentrate on the case of even @xmath11 and an odd number of flavors @xmath6 . in section [ sec : symmetries ] we propose a parity transformation for an odd number of flavors that leaves the qcd@xmath0-lagrangean invariant .",
    "this is an essential point since the rmt of qcd@xmath0 has parity symmetry as an input , and the conclusion is that an odd number of masses have to be zero for the lagrangean to be invariant ( at the classical level ) . in section [ sec : universality ]",
    "we introduce pseudo - orthogonal polynomials and calculate the spectral correlation functions in the microscopic limit for even @xmath11 .",
    "it turns out that for an odd number of flavors the correlators can be expressed using the kernel from the chiral unitary ensemble , which is equivalent to four - dimensional qcd , when we equate the number of chiral fermions to @xmath18 and by analytic continuation work in the sector of topological charge @xmath2 . in section",
    "@xmath19 we use pseudo - orthogonal polynomials to express the rmt kernel in terms of field theory finite - volume partition functions . by looking at the result from @xcite for the finite - volume partition function",
    "we arrive at the conclusion that when one mass is zero , as is necessary for symmetry reasons , the @xmath11-odd field theory partition function is zero .",
    "the lesson is that the odd-@xmath11 partition function should not be regarded as defining a theory in itself , but only as a function that is necessary in order to extract spectral information in the even-@xmath11 theory .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the spectral density does not make sense when @xmath11 is odd due to ( [ rho ] ) .",
    "our starting point is the qcd@xmath0-lagrangean with @xmath20 flavors @xmath21 : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the gluonic field strength and @xmath24 are the eigenvalues of the mass matrix . in three dimensions",
    "we do not have chirality at our disposal because @xmath25 .",
    "the lowest dimensional representation of the @xmath26-matrices is the pauli - matrices and the corresponding fields are two - spinors .",
    "this has the disadvantage that the mass terms are parity @xmath27 is a rotation .",
    "we choose ( somewhat arbitrarily ) to let @xmath28 denote inversion around the 1-axis . ]",
    "if all masses are zero then @xmath29 is invariant under @xmath28 since the dirac - term in the lagrangean respects the parity transformation , but in general the masses are non - zero and @xmath29 is not invariant . for reasons that will become apparent",
    "later we distinguish between an even and an odd number of flavors .",
    "in @xcite it is argued that for an even number @xmath30 of flavors we can achieve parity invariance by using a four - dimensional representation of the @xmath26-matrices . the representation employed ( minkowski space ) is @xmath31 we see that for a four - spinor @xmath32 the mass term is @xmath33 the last expression is identical to @xmath34 in a two - dimensional representation of the @xmath26-matrices with @xmath35 . if the mass matrix @xmath36 is chosen to be @xmath37 it follows that the lagrangean ( [ l_qcd ] ) is invariant under parity when the transformation is defined as @xmath38    for an odd number @xmath6 of flavors we write the lagrangean as @xmath39 the @xmath26-matrices are represented by the pauli - matrices : @xmath40 above we used the grouping of the spinors @xmath41 into four - spinors and the @xmath42-matrices ( [ representation ] ) as @xmath26-matrices to obtain a parity invariant system when assigning masses of opposite sign to the constituents of the four - spinors . here",
    "we use that if @xmath43 is a representation of the dirac algebra then @xmath44 is an inequivalent representation of the algebra @xcite .",
    "this allows us to use negative masses also for an odd number of flavors , where we can not group the spinors as in ( [ lmass ] ) .",
    "as far as @xmath45 and @xmath46 are concerned , we use the transformation defined in ( [ parity ] ) . for the remaining two - spinor @xmath47",
    "we employ the transformation @xmath48 since a mass term changes sign under this transformation the overall symmetry is retained only when @xmath49 .",
    "this is also the case if we had used the representation ( [ lonegamma ] ) with opposite signs on all the matrices .",
    "provided that we want to study an invariant lagrangean we are therefore confined to consider an _",
    "odd _ number of massless fermions for odd @xmath20 .",
    "notice , that if we want to have an optimal amount of discrete symmetry in the theory , with as many non - zero mass terms as possible , there is no alternative to the choice @xmath50 ( with @xmath49 ) of the mass matrix .",
    "we have an odd number of two - spinors that have to transform among each other .",
    "this means that the transformed fields are permutations of the original fields ( multiplied by a pauli matrix such that mass terms change signs ) .",
    "unless the fields swap positions two and two their masses have to be zero in order to have invariance , and when two fields interchange positions the @xmath51 assignment of the masses make sure that the mass terms are invariant .",
    "this automatically leaves one field that has to transform into itself , thus giving rise to a symmetry breaking mass term unless @xmath49 .",
    "having discussed the choice of mass matrix we now turn to the rmt of odd - flavored qcd@xmath0 .",
    "the qcd@xmath0 rmt partition function for an odd number of flavors in the eigenvalue representation of the unitary ensemble is @xcite @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the vandermonde determinant .",
    "notice , that it is precisely the choice @xmath49 , which we now make , that makes the partition function real .",
    "with @xmath54 the @xmath55-point correlation function is given by @xmath56 the orthodox way to calculate these correlators would be to find orthogonal polynomials @xmath57 with respect to the weight function @xmath58 introduce the kernel @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the norm of @xmath61 , and then use the expression @xmath62 to determine the @xmath55-point correlation functions .",
    "this method can not be used here since @xmath63 is odd and the integration interval is even , and thus orthogonal polynomials are not defined",
    ".    inspired by @xcite we will now introduce a method based on what we will call pseudo - orthogonal polynomials that can be applied to any odd measure on an even interval as long as @xmath11 is even . consider for simplicity the massless case where @xmath64 .",
    "for the chiral unitary ensemble ( chue , with @xmath1 ) the weight function for @xmath65 massless fermions in the sector of topological charge @xmath66 is @xmath67 and we denote the associated orthogonal polynomials @xmath68 with norm @xmath69 . now put @xmath70 , @xmath2 , and define the pseudo - orthogonal polynomials by @xmath71 these new polynomials are pseudo - orthogonal with respect to the weight function @xmath64 on the real line in the sense that @xmath72 where the brackets indicate integration .",
    "the proof is straightforward .",
    "the chue - measure for @xmath65 massive flavors is @xmath73 the measure is valid in the sector of vanishing topological charge . in the sector of charge @xmath74",
    "we obtain the correct measure by adding @xmath75 massive flavors and then letting the masses vanish .",
    "we see that in the sector where @xmath2 and @xmath70 the measure is @xmath76 simple calculations shows that the pseudo - orthogonal polynomials with respect to ( [ uemassive ] ) are given by the polynomials orthogonal with respect to ( [ chuemassive ] ) by the definitions ( [ def1 ] ) and ( [ def2 ] ) .",
    "because the qcd@xmath0 masses are pairwise assigned with opposite sign we may identify the @xmath77th chiral mass with the positive mass of the @xmath77th qcd@xmath0 fermion .",
    "notice that in the matrix representation of chue half - integer values of @xmath66 are not permitted since the matrices integrated over are @xmath78 @xcite . in the eigenvalue representation , however , we can without problems make an analytic continuation such that @xmath2 makes sense , at least from a formal point of view .",
    "we are now ready to calculate the microscopic spectral correlators of odd - flavored qcd@xmath0 , _ i.e. _ , the correlation functions taken in the limit @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 where @xmath82 are kept constant .",
    "we always assume that @xmath11 is even .",
    "@xmath83 defined in ( [ vandermonde ] ) can be expressed as the determinant of an @xmath8 matrix : @xmath84 consider the @xmath8 matrix @xmath85 the crucial observation is that @xmath86 is related to @xmath83 .",
    "performing on @xmath87 the row operations @xmath88 followed by @xmath89 we end up with @xmath90 where we have discarded a factor coming from the row operations .",
    "the determinant of an @xmath8 matrix @xmath91 is defined as @xmath92 from which it follows that @xmath93 , or @xmath94 now notice that @xmath95 looking at ( [ vdmlike ] ) we see that we are in a position where we can substitute the entries in @xmath96 with the pseudo - orthogonal polynomials ( properly normalized ) . because of pseudo - orthogonality we may then write , as in the case of orthogonal polynomials , @xmath97 where the @xmath98 s are pseudo - orthogonal . with @xmath99 we obtain @xmath100 we have discarded irrelevant overall factors .",
    "the introduction of pseudo - orthogonal polynomials have led us to an expression for the kernel that involves orthogonal polynomials for which the microscopic limit is universal @xcite : @xmath101 by the christoffel - darboux formula the sum over the polynomials is proportional to @xmath102/(\\lambda^2-{\\lambda'}^2)$ ] and since @xmath103 the @xmath79 limit corresponds to the @xmath104 limit .",
    "now compare ( [ qcd3kernel ] ) with the expression for the chue kernel @xcite @xmath105 in the sector of zero topological charge .",
    "to go to the sector of charge @xmath66 we can , by flavor - topology duality , take the @xmath106 kernel with @xmath107 massive flavors and then let @xmath75 masses vanish .",
    "the sector with @xmath2 is then by continuation given by ( [ chuekernel ] ) multiplied by a factor @xmath108 .",
    "we arrive at the following master formula for odd - flavored qcd@xmath0 : @xmath109 the formula implies that all properties of the chue that are universal similarly are universal in odd - flavored qcd@xmath0 and especially that all microscopic correlators are universal .",
    "we see that in the case of the microscopic spectral density , where we have to evaluate @xmath110 , the odd - flavored qcd@xmath0 kernel and the chue kernel agree up to a proportionality constant .",
    "they do not , however , agree for higher - order correlators .",
    "the chue kernel is given by @xcite @xmath111 + 1 } \\sqrt{\\zeta_1\\zeta_2}}{(\\zeta_1 ^ 2-\\zeta_2 ^ 2 )   \\prod_f   \\sqrt{(\\zeta_1 ^ 2+\\mu_f^2)(\\zeta_2 ^ 2+\\mu_f^2 ) } } \\frac{\\det \\mathcal{b}}{\\det \\mathcal{a } } ~,\\ ] ] where @xmath112 is a normalization constant , and where @xmath113 is an @xmath114 matrix and @xmath115 is an @xmath116 matrix defined as @xmath117 in qcd@xmath0 the hitherto only known microscopic spectral correlator is the massless microscopic spectral density @xcite @xmath118\\ ] ] which coincides with the massless chue microscopic spectral density @xmath119\\ ] ] precisely when @xmath70 and @xmath2 .    from ( [ kernelrelation ] )",
    "it directly follows that the microscopic spectral density obeys a series of decoupling relations @xcite : @xmath120 these relations tell us that when we make two quarks with equal masses ( up to a sign ) infinitely heavy the spectral density of the new system becomes that of the system consisting of the remaining quarks .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ densities ] which shows the massless microscopic spectral density ( msd ) for one and three massless flavors , and for one massless and two massive flavors .",
    "the massive msd is calculated using the master formula ( [ kernelrelation ] ) .",
    "when the masses vanish the massive msd will become that of three massless fermions while the act of making the masses infinitely heavy will make the massive msd become that of one massless flavor .",
    "the newly acquired universality of the microscopic spectral correlators will now allow us to express the odd - flavored rmt kernel for even @xmath11 in terms of the field theory finite - volume partition functions of qcd@xmath0 , as it was done in @xcite for the other ensembles .",
    "having done this we go on to simplify the expression for the finite - volume partition functions considerably when we take the conditions for parity invariance into account .    the main ingredient in the proof is a result from @xcite that in our case says that @xmath121 } \\sqrt{\\lambda \\lambda ' } \\prod_{f=1}^{\\alpha } \\sqrt{(\\lambda^2+m^2_f)({\\lambda'}^2+m^2_f ) }   \\nonumber \\\\ \\times \\int { \\textrm{d}}^{{(n-1)}^2 } m e^{-n{\\textrm{tr}}v(m^2 ) } \\det(m ) \\prod_{f=1}^{\\alpha } \\det(m^2+m_f^2 ) \\det(\\lambda - m ) \\det(\\lambda'-m ) ~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the integral appearing in the second line is the rmt partition function in the case where the square hermitian matrices are of odd dimensions , and with two extra imaginary masses @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "the proof goes as in @xcite : @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the rmt measure .",
    "rewriting in terms of eigenvalue variables we get @xmath126 where @xmath127 is given by ( [ uemassive ] ) .",
    "now absorb the factors of @xmath128 and @xmath129 into the vandermonde determinants : @xmath130 these new vandermonde determinants are @xmath8 , @xmath11 even , and thus we have the method of pseudo - orthogonal polynomials at our disposal .",
    "@xmath131 where the @xmath132 are the pseudo - orthogonal polynomials corresponding to @xmath127 .",
    "note that the proof does not carry through when @xmath11 is odd .",
    "now , because of universality the rmt partition function @xmath133 is equal ( up to a constant ) to the field theory finite - volume partition function @xmath134 and thus @xmath135 in formula ( [ 2oddkernel ] ) @xmath14 now has the microscopic masses as entries , and the partition functions have been labelled with @xmath11 and @xmath136 implicitly through @xmath137 .",
    "notice that we have already taken the double - microscopic limit - the label is important because the partition functions depend on @xmath11 in a crucial manner .",
    "we have @xcite @xmath138 ~.\\ ] ] in the expression @xmath139 is a vandermonde determinant of the masses and @xmath140 is an @xmath141 matrix of the form ( @xmath142 , @xmath143 @xmath144 formula ( [ z_n ] ) can be simplified considerably when @xmath145 .",
    "take the matrix @xmath146 and interchange @xmath147 such that the rows @xmath148 to @xmath149 become positioned right below the @xmath150-dependent row . because the interchange of two rows amounts to an overall sign change of the determinant we see that @xmath151 because of the @xmath51 symmetry of the masses and the block structure of ( [ d1])-([d2 ] ) .",
    "thus @xmath152 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\left\\ {   \\begin{array}{ll } 2 \\det\\mathbf{d}(\\mu=0,\\{\\mu_k\\ } ) & { \\textrm{if $ n$ is even } } \\\\ 0                                & { \\textrm{if $ n$ is odd } } ~. \\end{array } \\right . \\end{aligned}\\",
    "] ] besides the simplification this expression tells us that we should not look upon the odd-@xmath11 partition function as defining a theory in itself , but only as a function that enters in the expressions of the even-@xmath11 theory .",
    "note that when @xmath2 the chue kernel ( [ chiralkernel ] ) becomes complex and thus the normalization coefficient @xmath153}\\ ] ] becomes complex also .",
    "we have explicitly checked that ( [ 2oddkernel ] ) gives the expected results in a few cases , and in each case the normalization constants had to be chosen complex .",
    "finally , we mention that the decoupling relations ( [ decoupl ] ) can be explicitly derived from ( [ 2oddkernel ] ) .",
    "there are two major points to take away from this section .",
    "first , the fact that for even @xmath11 we are able to rewrite the rmt kernel in terms of finite - volume partition functions while the proof can not be applied to the case of odd @xmath11 .",
    "second , the fact the finite - volume partition function for odd @xmath11 vanishes when the only input is the mass assignment that guarantees parity invariance , a crucial point when the rmt is constructed . from this",
    "we conclude that when extracting spectral information about odd - flavored qcd@xmath0 from rmt we should look upon the even-@xmath11 theory as defining the theory while the odd-@xmath11 finite - volume partition function should be looked upon merely as a function that enters in the expression for the even-@xmath11 kernel .",
    "we have considered the rmt formulation of qcd@xmath0 with an odd number of flavors in the mesoscopic scaling region and we have calculated the microscopic kernel from which all microscopic spectral correlation functions can be found .",
    "we have shown the universality of the kernel by the discovery of a deep connection between the kernel of odd - flavored qcd@xmath0 with @xmath6 flavors and qcd@xmath5 ( @xmath1 ) with @xmath70 flavors in the sector of topological charge @xmath2 , brought about by the introduction of pseudo - orthogonal polynomials .",
    "the result has the consequence that all properties of the four - dimensional theory that are universal similarly are universal in three dimensions .",
    "we end by noting that odd - flavored qcd@xmath154 now finally has caught up with its older and more mature sisters qcd@xmath5 and even - flavored qcd@xmath0 as far as universality is concerned .",
