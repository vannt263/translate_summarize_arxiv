    ", i.e. , modification to general relativity ( gr ) at long distances is responsible for cosmic acceleration .",
    "the latter class of models includes scalar - tensor theories , @xmath2 gravity  @xcite , and the dvali - gabadadze - porrati ( dgp ) braneworld  @xcite .",

    "the second way is decoupling the scalar from matter in the vicinity of the matter sources .",
    "this is known as the vainshtein mechanism  @xcite , and the dgp braneworld offers a nice example that implements it by a non - linear self - interaction in the kinetic term .",
    "see also a recent paper  @xcite for yet another way of suppressing the scalar - mediated force .",
    "inspired by the dgp braneworld , a class of scalar - tensor theories of gravity has been explored that enjoys self - screening of the scalar - mediated force in the vicinity of matter due to non - linear derivative interactions .",
    "such a scalar degree of freedom is called the galileon field in the original proposal  @xcite , because the equation of motion for the scalar @xmath3 is invariant under @xmath4 on minkowski spacetime .",
