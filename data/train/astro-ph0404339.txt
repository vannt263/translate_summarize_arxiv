    "the relative distribution of matter and light in the universe is one of the outstanding problems in astrophysics .",
    "clusters of galaxies , the largest gravitationally relaxed objects in the universe , are important probes of the distribution of mass and light .",
    "@xcite first computed the mass - to - light ratio of the coma cluster using the virial theorem and found that dark matter dominates the cluster mass .",
    "recent determinations using the virial theorem yield mass - to - light ratios of @xmath1 ( girardi et al .  2000 and references therein ) .",
    "equating the mass - to - light ratio in clusters to the global value provides an estimate of the mass density of the universe ; this estimate is subject to significant systematic error introduced by differences in galaxy populations between cluster cores and lower density regions ( @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , some numerical simulations suggest that cluster mass - to - light ratios exceed the universal value ( @xcite ) .",
    "determining the global matter density from cluster mass - to - light ratios therefore requires knowledge of the dependence of mass - to - light ratios on environment .",
    "bahcall et al .  ( 1995 ) show that mass - to - light ratios increase with scale from galaxies to groups to clusters .",
    "ellipticals have larger overall values of @xmath2 than spirals , presumably a result of younger , bluer stellar populations in spirals . at the scale of cluster",
    "virial radii , mass - to - light ratios appear to reach a maximum value .",
    "some estimates of the mass - to - light ratio on very large scales ( @xmath310@xmath4 ) are available ( @xcite ) , but the systematic uncertainties are large .",
    "there are few estimates of mass - to - light ratios on scales between cluster virial radii and scales of 10@xmath4 ( rines et al .",
    "2000 , rines et al .  2001a , biviano & girardi 2003 , katgert et al .",
    "2003 , kneib et al .",
    "2003 , rines et al .",
    "2004 , tully 2004 and references therein ) . on these scales , many galaxies near clusters are bound to the cluster but not yet in equilibrium ( @xcite ) .",
    "these cluster infall regions have received relatively little scrutiny because they are mildly nonlinear , making their properties very difficult to predict analytically .",
    "however , these scales are exactly the ones in which galaxy properties change dramatically ( e.g. , ellingson et al .  2001 , lewis et al .  2002 , gomez et al .  2003 , treu et al",
    ".  2003 , balogh et al .  2004 , gray et al .  2004 ) .",
    "variations in the mass - to - light ratio with environment could have important physical implications ; they could be produced either by a varying dark matter fraction or by variations in the efficiency of star formation with environment . in blue light ,",
    "however , higher star formation rates in field galaxies could produce lower mass - to - light ratios outside cluster cores resulting only from the different contributions of young and old stars to the total luminosity ( @xcite ) .",
    "galaxies in cluster infall regions produce sharp features in redshift surveys .",
    "early investigations of this infall pattern focused on its use as a direct indicator of the global matter density @xmath5 .",
    "unfortunately , random motions caused by galaxy - galaxy interactions and substructure within the infall region smear out this cosmological signal ( diaferio & geller 1997 , vedel & hartwick 1998 ) . instead of sharp peaks in redshift space ,",
    "infall regions around real clusters typically display a well - defined envelope in redshift space which is significantly denser than the surrounding environment ( @xcite , hereafter paper i , and references therein ) .",
    "diaferio & geller ( 1997 ) and diaferio ( 1999 ) analyzed the dynamics of infall regions with numerical simulations and found that in the outskirts of clusters , random motions due to substructure and non - radial motions make a substantial contribution to the amplitude of the caustics which delineate the infall regions .",
    "diaferio & geller ( 1997 ) showed that the amplitude of the caustics is a measure of the escape velocity from the cluster ; identification of the caustics therefore allows a determination of the mass profile of the cluster on scales @xmath6 .",
    "diaferio & geller ( 1997 ) and diaferio ( 1999 ) show that nonparametric measurements of caustics yield cluster mass profiles accurate to @xmath750% on scales of up to 10 @xmath8 mpc .",
    "this method assumes only that galaxies trace the velocity field .",
    "indeed , simulations suggest that little or no velocity bias exists on linear and mildly non - linear scales ( @xcite ) .",
    "the caustic method has been applied to systems as large as the shapley supercluster ( @xcite ) and as small as the fornax cluster ( @xcite ) as well as to many nearby clusters ( paper i ) .",
    "biviano & girardi ( 2003 ) applied the caustic technique to an ensemble cluster created by stacking redshifts around 43 clusters from the 2df galaxy redshift survey .",
    "rines et al .",
    "( 2000 ) found an enclosed mass - to - light ratio of @xmath9 within 4@xmath10 of a576 .",
    "rines et al .",
    "( 2001 ) used 2mass photometry and the mass profile from geller et al .",
    "( 1999 ) to compute the mass - to - light profile of coma in the k - band .",
    "they found a roughly flat profile with a possible decrease in @xmath11 with radius by no more than a factor of 3 .",
    "biviano & girardi ( 2003 ) find a decreasing ratio of mass density to total galaxy number density .",
    "for early - type galaxies only , the number density profile is consistent with a constant mass - to - light ( actually mass - to - number ) ratio .    here",
    ", we calculate the infrared mass - to - light profile within the turnaround radius for the cairns clusters ( paper i ) , a sample of nine nearby rich , x - ray luminous clusters .",
    "we use photometry from 2mass , the two micron all sky survey ( @xcite ) and add several new redshifts to obtain complete or nearly complete surveys of galaxies up to 1 - 2 magnitudes fainter than @xmath12 ( as determined by cole et al .",
    "2001 and kochanek et al .",
    "infrared light is a better tracer of stellar mass than optical light ; it is relatively insensitive to dust extinction and recent star formation . despite these advantages , there are very few measurements of infrared mass - to - light ratios in clusters ( @xcite ) .",
    "the cairns clusters are 8 of the 14 abell clusters that are : nearby ( @xmath13 ) , abell richness class @xmath14 , x - ray luminous ( @xmath15erg s@xmath16 ) galaxy clusters with declination @xmath17 . between 1997 and 2003",
    ", we collected 5607 redshifts ( both new and remeasured ) in large areas around nearby clusters with the fast spectrograph on the flwo 1.5-m telescope in arizona .",
    "we targeted galaxies within a projected radius of @xmath710@xmath4 of the clusters , selecting targets first from possii 103ae plates and later from 2mass when it became available .",
    "the redshift catalogs in rines et al .",
    "( 2004 ) complete @xmath18 band magnitude - limited samples extending 1 - 2 magnitudes fainter than the characteristic magnitude @xmath19 .",
    "these samples include @xmath760 - 85% of the total light in the clusters and their infall regions .",
    "figure [ fig : caustics ] shows the redshifts of galaxies surrounding nearby clusters as a function of projected radius ( normalized to @xmath20 , the radius within which the average density is 200 times the critical density ) .",
    "the caustic pattern ( a dense envelope in phase space with well - defined edges ) is evident in the combined cluster as well as in each of the 9 clusters . using the phase space distribution of galaxies in cluster infall regions , we apply the kinematic mass estimator of d99 to these clusters .",
    "the resulting mass profiles agree well with nfw ( navarro et al .",
    "1997 ) and hernquist ( 1990 ) models , but exclude an isothermal sphere .",
    "these mass profiles agree with x - ray masses at small radius as well as virial masses ( after correction for the surface pressure term ) at slightly larger radii ( @xcite , paper i ) .",
    "the latter is primarily a consistency check as the caustic technique utilizes the same kinematic data as the virial theorem .",
    "this consistency can be further demonstrated with the velocity dispersion profiles ( see paper i and rines et al .",
    "when using the mass - to - light ratio in clusters to estimate @xmath5 , one must determine whether the luminosity functions of field and cluster galaxies differ significantly .",
    "given the well - known morphology - density relation , it is possible that the two lfs differ significantly .",
    "we use 2mass photometry to determine the near - infrared luminosity functions for the cairns clusters and infall regions ( @xcite ) .",
    "the cluster and infall region lfs are very similar to each other ( figure [ fig : klfncomp ] ) and to the field lf for relatively bright galaxies ( @xmath21 ) . because of this similarity",
    ", we can correct for the luminosity in faint galaxies using the field lf .",
    "our redshift surveys include 6085% of the total light .",
    "both the surface number density and surface luminosity density profiles of cluster / infall region members are more extended than the mass profiles of paper i. figure [ fig : mlkprof ] shows the mass - to - light profiles of the cairns clusters .",
    "the mass - to - light profiles are either flat or show a decreasing @xmath11 with increasing radius .",
    "the mean mass - to - light ratio within @xmath20 is a factor of @xmath22 larger than the mean value outside @xmath20 .",
    "the decreasing mass - to - light profiles could be caused by gradients in stellar populations with radius ; such effects have been invoked to account for a similar result for b band mass - to - light profiles in simulations ( @xcite ) . in k band , however , changes in stellar populations with radius are expected to change the mean stellar mass - to - light ratio by @xmath23 .",
    "thus , the cairns mass - to - light profiles provide tentative evidence for variations in the efficiency of galaxy formation and/or disruption .",
    "environments with higher virial temperatures ( like cluster centers ) are more efficient at disrupting galaxies and/or less efficient at forming them .    a related trend has been noted by lin et al .",
    "( 2003 , 2004 ) , who show that k - band mass - to - light ratios within @xmath24 increase with increasing cluster mass .",
    "this result indicates that more massive clusters ( with larger virial temperatures ) have less efficient galaxy formation and/or more efficient galaxy disruption .",
    "we confirm this trend in rines et al .",
    "because cluster infall regions should be composed of galaxies inhabiting less massive systems ( @xcite ) and/or regions with lower virial temperatures , the above trend predicts that cluster infall regions should have smaller mass - to - light ratios than virial regions , consistent with the cairns results .",
    "figure [ fig : combomlk ] shows the mass - to - light profile of the combined cairns cluster ( normalized to unity at @xmath20 ) .",
    "the mass - to - light profile clearly decreases with radius",
    ". the combined cluster should be less susceptible to substructure than the individual clusters .",
    "figure [ fig : combomlk ] shows that the mass - to - light ratio in shells decreases by about a factor of 2 from the virial region to the infall region , consistent with the results for individual clusters . taking the mass - to - light ratio in cluster infall regions as an estimate of the global value and the sdss luminosity density extrapolated to @xmath18 band ( @xcite ) , we estimate @xmath25 ( statistical ) .",
    "this estimate is somewhat lower if we use the @xmath18 band luminosity density of either cole et al .",
    "( 2001 ) or kochanek et al .",
    "we discuss potential systematic effects in rines et al .",
    "most of these effects would flatten the observed mass - to - light profiles relative to the true profiles , suggesting that the observed decrease in mass - to - light ratio with radius is real .",
    "cluster infall regions contain more galaxies than their virial regions .",
    "if currently popular cosmological models are correct , the mass in infall regions will eventually accrete onto the parent clusters , and their final masses will increase by a factor of about 2 .",
    "near - infrared luminosity functions depend only weakly on environment , at least at the bright end .",
    "we show that near - infrared light is more extended than mass in cluster infall regions , suggesting environmental dependence of the efficiency of galaxy formation and/or disruption .",
    "if more efficient galaxy disruption is responsible , intracluster stars might be a significant component of stellar mass in clusters .",
    "the mass - to - light ratios in infall regions suggest a low @xmath26 .",
    "future work is needed to determine the significance of the conflict of this result with the currently favored @xmath27 .",
