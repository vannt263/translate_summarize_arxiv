    "it is well known @xcite that the probability for absorbing one photon per unit time from an electromagnetic field is proportional to the average value of the ordered product of the negative and positive frequency electric field operators over some quantum state @xmath3 , also known as the statistical operator . in the simplest case of a single - mode , that probability can be expressed in terms of the standard bosonic ` annihilation ' and ` creation ' operators @xmath0 and @xmath1 , satisfying the commutation relation @xmath4=1 $ ] , as@xmath5where @xmath3 stands for the field state just before absorption _ _ _ _ and @xmath6 is an appropriate coefficient . after interacting with some detector that absorbs one photon",
    ", the field makes a transition  to a new state , which can be formally described by the action of a _ photon subtraction superoperator _ ( pss ) @xmath7 as @xcite @xmath8where @xmath9 represents the field state immediately after the subtraction of one photon and @xmath10 is the probability for that process .",
    "the hermiticity of @xmath9 is always assured whenever @xmath7 takes the form @xmath11where @xmath12 is some  operator responsible for the subtraction of one photon from the field and the explicit form of @xmath12 depends on the details of the field - detector interaction . since the 1960s several models were proposed @xcite ( see @xcite for more references therein ) and the first one @xcite used the rather simple identification @xmath13 , when eq .",
    "( [ ge ] ) becomes    @xmath14    and we shall refer to it as _ a - model_. although such a form , eq .",
    "( j - a ) , seems quite natural in view of equation ( [ p - ab ] ) , this choice was , as a matter of fact , intuitive , although later , under certain assumptions  such as the weak coupling , low intensity and short interaction time  the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite were able to derive it from doing a microscopic  analysis .",
    "nonetheless , if those assumptions are replaced by others , one can obtain different superoperators @xmath7 . a family of pss based on the _ nonlinear lowering operators _  of the form @xmath15 , where @xmath16 , was derived in ref .",
    "the special case @xmath17 , called _ e - model _ , @xmath18was originally proposed _",
    "ad hoc _ in @xcite . later , analyzing carefully a microscopic model , it was shown @xcite that both superoperators @xmath19 and @xmath20 are particular cases of a more general one , where @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) is specific for a small ( large ) mean photon number .",
    "recently , the a - model was subdued to an experimental verification in the low photon number regime and weak field - detector coupling @xcite .",
    "that experiment employed a beam - splitter and a single photon on / off detector ( spd ) , within a simple scheme as illustrated in the fig .",
    "[ scheme]a : a low intensity beam , with a small mean photon number per unit time , is prepared to hit a low reflectivity beam - splitter . the reflected beam is continuously measured by the spd , and whenever it clicks , the transmitted field statistical operator can be described , approximately , by the a - model @xcite .    however , as already observed in @xcite , @xmath19 is an unbounded superoperator and some physical inconsistencies appear @xcite .",
    "for example , @xmath19 does not hold for large values of the initial mean photon number , since the probability of a photon subtraction , @xmath21 , may become larger than @xmath22 . moreover , applying @xmath19 on some specific field states , the calculations predict results which look counterintuitive .",
    "for example , operating with @xmath23 on the thermal state , which has the photon number distribution @xmath24where @xmath25 is the mean photon number , for post - selected state we obtain @xmath26 .",
    "although this prediction was confirmed experimentally in the ` quantum limit ' of small mean photon number , @xmath27 , it is counterintuitive from the classical point of view , namely , a high intensity field can not double the intensity due to a one - photon detection .",
    "so @xmath19 can describe satisfactorily the low intensity field but not a high intensity one . quite differently , using the e - model we get @xmath28 , which is sound for a high intensity field after one - photon detection , whereas it does not reproduce the observed doubling for low intensity .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to analyze the behavior of the pss in the ` classical limit ' ( large mean photon number ) and how the pattern of post - selected state statistics changes smoothly and continuously as function of the field intensity .",
    "the _ quantum - classical transition _ in photon subtraction process regards the passage between the two extreme situations for classical field states that can be prepared with arbitrary low and high intensities .    besides the photon subtraction , one",
    "may also implement the photon addition operation by the conditional stimulated down - conversion in a non - linear optical crystal , as reported in @xcite and illustrated in the fig .",
    "[ scheme]b . inside the crystal",
    "the pumped photons may decay spontaneously into two entangled photons with energies that sum up to that of the parent one . upon detecting one of these photons ( known as the trigger photon ) along a particular direction",
    ", the other photon state is unambiguously determined .",
    "if one injects a seed light into the crystal , the stimulated emission may occur into the same mode , and the detection of a single trigger photon ( by means of a spd ) indicates the conditional generation of the photon - added state . using this scheme ,",
    "the one photon addition superoperator ( pas ) for low beam intensity is@xmath29(we call it the _",
    "_ a__@xmath30_-model _ ) , which was experimentally implemented for a low mean photon number @xcite .",
    "since the superoperator @xmath31 is unbounded , with the probability of photon addition becoming larger than @xmath22 for large field intensities , in analogy to the e - model we also define the _",
    "_ e__@xmath30_-model _ as @xmath32that will also be analyzed and discussed below .    in the present paper",
    "we generalize the theoretical analysis presented in @xcite for both , the photon subtraction and photon addition operations , by substituting the spd by the @xmath33-photon _ resolving _ resol or _ nonresolving _ @xcite detector , and obtain formally pss and pas valid for an arbitrary field at any intensity . although the resulting formal expressions for the pss and pas are compact , in general , it is not straightforward to obtain closed analytical expressions for these operations for an arbitrary initial field state",
    ". therefore , it is desirable to have some simple approximate expressions for the pss and pas that hold in a specific regime of parameters and can be easily evaluated for an arbitrary field state , providing a simple means of predicting the outcome of the experiment . in this connection , we show that in the quantum limit ( small photon number ) , the a - model and a@xmath30-model are good approximations to the exact pss and pas for any field state , respectively , while in the classical limit ( large photon number ) , the e- and e@xmath30- models are more appropriate for a nonresolving detector and the ` _ _ classical _ _ ' field states : coherent , thermal and ` mixed light ' .",
    "the paper contains three additional sections . in section [ ii ]",
    "we obtain exact analytical expressions for the pss and analyze the behavior of the photon subtraction probabilities and post - selected states statistics for any intensity of the field and for different kinds of ` classical ' field states : ( a ) coherent , ( b ) thermal and ( c ) ` mixed light ' @xcite , which , in principle , can be produced in the laboratory with arbitrarily low or high beam intensities . in section [ iii ]",

    "the important effect of the measurement back - action may be clearly verified by comparing the outcomes of the instantaneous @xmath33-photon detection ( using either @xmath46 or @xmath48 ) to the sequential detection of @xmath33 photons ( one by one , as a sequence of discernible clicks ) , using an array of @xmath33 spd s and detecting one click in each one . for the sequential @xmath33 photons detection",

    "we obtained the formal expressions for the pss and the pas , valid for any input state , and for the considered classical states we derived closed analytical expressions for the photon number distribution of the post - selected state and the associated lower factorial moments , as well as the photon addition and subtraction probabilities .",
    "we found that in the quantum regime ( small photon number ) the pss can be described approximately by the generalized a - model , while the pas by the generalizeda@xmath30-model for any field state .",
