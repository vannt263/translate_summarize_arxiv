    "three dimensional topological insulators host unusual surface states that can be described in a number of different ways@xcite . in models of free electrons that respect time reversal and charge conservation symmetries which are necessary to describe this phase , the surface is metallic .",
    "the surface electronic structure is comprised of an odd number of 2d dirac cones , which is impossible to realize in a purely 2d system with time reversal invariance .",
    "it is crucial that electrons transform as kramers pairs i.e. time reversal @xmath0 acting twice on electrons gives @xmath4",
    ".    other surface terminations of the topological bulk are also interesting . if @xmath0 is broken only at the surface , the metallic edge can be gapped to yield an insulating surface .",
    "the topological bulk properties are revealed in the properties of domain walls between opposite @xmath0 breaking regions on the surface .",
    "the domain walls are necessarily metallic and host an odd number of chiral dirac fermions @xmath5@xcite .",
    "thus , each domain is associated with hall conductance @xmath6 , ( and @xmath7 in the natural units for thermal hall conductance ) where @xmath8 is an integer .",
    "such a half - integer hall conductance if forbidden in a 2d system in the absence of electron fractionalization and is directly related to the magnetoelectric effect@xcite .",
    "the magnetoelectric polarizability of topological insulators is @xmath3 * ? ? ?",
    "* in contrast to trivial , time reversal symmetric insulators which have @xmath9 .",
    "if , on the other hand we break charge conservation on the surface , by pairing and condensing cooper pairs , the resulting surface superconductor also has exotic properties - its vortices host majorana zero modes@xcite , which only occur in 2d systems if @xmath0 symmetry is broken .",
    "it was believed that these were the only possible surface states of the 3d topological insulator - i.e. they must either be gapless ( e.g. metallic ) or break one of the defining symmetries .",
    "recently , inspired by the study of bosonic topological phases@xcite , and fermionic topological superconductors @xcite , a different surface termination has been recognized , that preserves all symmetries and develops an energy gap at the surface@xcite . in this situation",
    "the surface develops topological order i.e. there are anyonic excitations bound to the surface .",
    "while the topological order itself may be realized in 2d , the transformation properties of anyons under action of the symmetry is unlike in any 2d system .",
    "a close analog of this problem was recently discussed in the context of fermionic topological superconductors protected by @xmath0 symmetry , where a non - abelian surface topological order was identified@xcite .",
    "the discussion in this paper will closely follow this earlier work .",
    "of course , such surface states will only be realized in systems with strong electron correlations - and represents a qualitatively new property of interacting topological insulators .",
    "this is analogous to the argument that in a 2d quantum spin system with s=1/2 per unit cell , a gapped , symmetric state must be topologically ordered@xcite . indeed",
    "the absence of ordering is taken as a sign of topological order . similarly ,",
    "if on the surface of a 3d topological insulator , no sign of superconductivity or @xmath0 breaking is present but an energy gap opens , this will be indicative of topological order .",
    "in fact , as discussed in the context of fermionic topological superconductors@xcite , and as we will see below , the topological order here is required to be _ non - abelian_. this mechanism may provide a route to realizing non - abelian topological order , which would provide further impetus in the search for strongly correlated topological insulators such as smb@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "let us discuss some of the key physical requirements that the topologically ordered surface of a 3d ti should satisfy .",
    "( a ) ` @xmath11 ness ' : given the @xmath11 classification of free fermion tis , a pair of topologically ordered surfaces should ` unwind ' , and should be connected to a trivial confined phase .",
    "( b ) magnetoelectric response @xmath3 : in the absence of topological order , surface domains of the @xmath0 breaking insulating surface can be assigned a hall conductivity @xmath12 and thermal hall conductivity @xmath13 ( modulo integers ) .",
    "these are equivalent to the statement that the magnetoelectric response is @xmath3 .",
    "the implication for the topologically ordered states , is that in their 2d versions , which break @xmath0 , should have @xmath2 and @xmath13 modulo integers .",
    "( c ) on breaking charge conservation symmetry , it should be possible to remove the topological order while preserving @xmath0 .",
    "the resulting superconductor should host hc/2e vortices with majorana zero modes in their core .",
    "at first , a promising choice appears to be the read - moore pfaffian state@xcite .",
    "one picture of this phase is to consider a topological superconductor of spin polarized electrons in a @xmath14 pairing state , while the cooper pairs form a @xmath15 bosonic laughlin state .",
    "the latter has anyon excitations with fractional charge @xmath16 and a charged chiral edge state .",
    "the bound state of the superconductor quasiparticle and the charge @xmath17 excitation is identified as the electron and only those excitations that braid trivially with the electron are retained .",
    "this phase has 12 quasiparticles ( including the electron ) and @xmath18 .",
    "while this satisfies one of our criteria , it is readily seen from the topological spins of the associated topological order that this can not be realized in a @xmath0 invariant way even on a surface .",
    "however , a simple modification produces a more promising candidate which we call the t - pfaffian ( @xmath0 preserving pfaffian ) .",
    "consider the time reversed superconductor ( @xmath19 ) combined in the identical way with the abelian topological order of cooper pairs .",
    "this theory also has @xmath2 and @xmath13 when realized in 2d as required .",
    "moreover , the topological spins of the quasiparticles ( table [ t_spin ] ) now appear compatible with time reversal symmetry .",
    "we construct an exactly soluble 3d model that explicitly demonstrates that this state can be realized on the surface of a 3d bulk system while retaining @xmath0 and charge u(1 ) symmetries .",
    "since the surface topological order is forbidden in a strictly 2d system , we have realized _ a _",
    "3d topological insulator .",
    "moreover , this phase has magnetoelectric response @xmath3 .",
    "the remaining question is - is this the same phase as the free fermion topological insulator ?    a necessary condition to make",
    "this identification is that in the absence of charge conservation symmetry ( i.e. induced by proximity coupling the surface to a superconductor ) , one should recover the ti surface superconductor , without topological order , but with majorana zero modes in the vortex cores .",
    "the t - pfaffian state however allows no simple way to exit the topological phase even when charge conservation is absent , while retaining @xmath0 . on the other hand",
    ", we find that there are two versions of the t - pfaffian state ( t - pfaffian@xmath20 , with @xmath21 ) which differ in the way the nonabelian particles transform under time reversal symmetry .",
    "the non - abelian particles with bosonic ( fermionic ) topological spin is assigned @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "we can then demonstrate the following fact : ( i ) the two states corresponding to @xmath24 and @xmath25 differ by the surface topological order of a bosonic topological superconductor ( btsc ) with a @xmath26 classification and ( ii ) they can differ from the 3d free fermion ti surface at most , by the same btsc surface topological order .",
    "this implies that one of them _ must be _ the free fermion ti surface state while the other represents a mixture with a btsc although , unfortunately , we can not at present specify which of the @xmath21 is the 3d ti surface .",
    "we also discuss a second topological order , the pfaffian - antisemion state obtained recently @xcite by a series of elegant physical arguments .",
    "this state is a tensor product of the read - moore pfaffian state as discussed above , with a neutral anti - semion theory @xmath27 and has 24 quasiparticles .",
    "its statistics is compatible with @xmath0 symmetry , and furthermore passes the necessary requirements for being identified with the 3d ti surface state , including realizing the ti surface superconductor on breaking charge conservation @xcite .",
    "here we prove that it is indeed realizable as the surface state of a 3d bulk system with the requisite symmetries , by constructing an exactly soluble 3d lattice model . in both this and the t - pfaffian case , we find time reversal symmetry is respected _ only _ if the electrons transform projectively , i.e. as @xmath4",
    ".    a central tool will be the walker - wang construction@xcite of an exactly soluble lattice hamiltonian , that realizes the desired surface topological order , while maintaining a topologically trivial bulk .",
    "the model realizes a ground state wave function which is a superposition of 3d loops , one for each quasiparticle of the surface topological phase .",
    "the amplitude for any configuration is obtained as follows .",
    "the topological order is represented in terms of the @xmath28 and @xmath29 symbols that are associated with certain basic loop moves@xcite .",
    "first , one projects the loop configuration onto a 2d plane , and relates it to a reference configuration using the elementary moves . for each move ,",
    "the amplitude acquires a factor that is related to the @xmath28 and @xmath29 symbols .",
    "based on the resulting state one can readily show that an anyon that has nontrivial mutual statistics with some other excitation , is necessarily confined to the surface .",
    "furthermore , the surface excitations realize the required topological order . a minor caveat here is that for simplicity we work with bosonic walker wang models , without elementary fermions in the hilbert space@xcite . since the surface topological order is non - modular , i.e. it contains a fermion excitation that has trivial mutual statistics with everything else , this excitation is deconfined in the bulk .",
    "hence the 3d state that is realized is a z@xmath30 gauged version of the topological insulators , i.e. it involves bulk fermions that carry gauge charge and loops carrying @xmath31 gauge flux",
    ". this state may thought of as being obtained from a bosonic model , from a parton construction @xmath32 , where the z@xmath30 gauge charged fermions @xmath33 are placed in a 3d topological phase@xcite .",
    "this can be readily rectified by introducing elementary fermions @xmath34 and condensing the product @xmath35 which confines the gauge flux and removes the bulk topological order .    before moving to the technical details",
    "we raise the following question that may have occurred to some readers . how is the @xmath3 magneto electric response of 3d topological insulator reconciled with the topologically ordered insulating surfaces with @xmath0 symmetry ?",
    "note , @xmath3 implies that a weak applied magnetic field produces a surface charge density of @xmath36 ( modulo integer multiples of @xmath17 ) per flux quantum .",
    "of course , such a charge density is meaningful only if the surface is also insulating . also , charge is only determined modulo @xmath17 since integer multiples of @xmath17 can be screened by surface electrons .",
    "the fractional part however can not be screened by electrons and is a bulk property . specifying whether this charge density is @xmath37 leads to the usual argument for breaking of time reversal symmetry at the surface .",
    "the key observation here is that the candidate states both contain charge @xmath36 excitations which can screen the induced charge , and hence breaking of @xmath0 symmetry is not required .",
    "first let us introduce the topological order in the t - pfaffian state , including the anyons types and their fusion and braiding rules .",
    "the t - pfaffian state is a twisted version of the pfaffian state ( such that the state could potentially be time reversal invariant ) .",
    "similar to pfaffian , it is the combination of the non - abelian ising theory with the abelian @xmath38 theory .",
    "the ising theory describes a gauged a @xmath39 superconductor with @xmath11 fluxes and contains anyons labeled by @xmath40,@xmath41,@xmath42 .",
    "@xmath40 labels the trivial vacuum , @xmath42 is the fermion in the superconductor and @xmath41 is the @xmath11 flux .",
    "they fuse according to @xmath43 @xmath41 is hence nonabelian and has quantum dimension @xmath44 while @xmath42 has quantum dimension @xmath45 .",
    "the topological spins for the anyons are _ i=1 , _",
    "= e^-i , _ = -1 the braiding of the fermion @xmath42 around the @xmath11 flux results in a phase factor of @xmath46 .",
    "the ising sector is neutral and does not carry charge .",
    "the @xmath38 theory describes the @xmath47 quantum hall state where charge @xmath48 electron pairs form an effective @xmath49 bosonic laughlin state .",
    "the chern - simons effective theory for this state is = a__a_^ there are @xmath50 abelian anyons in the theory labeled by @xmath51 which add in the usual way when they fuse k_1k_2= ( k_1+k_2 )  8 the topological spins for the anyons are given by _",
    "k = e^ik^2 a full braiding of particle @xmath52 around particle @xmath53 results in a phase factor of _ kk=e^ikk the @xmath38 sector carries fractional charge with the @xmath52 particle carrying @xmath54 charge .",
    "the t - pfaffian theory is then obtained by combining @xmath40 and @xmath42 of the ising theory with even @xmath52 of the @xmath38 theory and @xmath41 with odd @xmath52 .",
    "that is , the t - pfaffian theory has anyons    llll i_0 & i_2 & i_4 & i_6 + _ 0 & _ 2 & _ 4 & _ 6 + _ 1 & _ 3 & _ 5 & _ 7    the charge assignment of the t - pfaffian theory is carried over from the @xmath38 theory .",
    "the fusion and braiding statistics of the combined anyons is the product of the fusion and braiding of the ising part and the @xmath1 part . in particular ,",
    "the topological spin for the combined anyons are     i & 1 & & i & & 1 & & i & + & &  1 & & -1 & & -1 & &  1 + & -1 & & -i & & -1 & & -i & + & & & & & & & & + charge & 0 & e/4 & e/2 & 3e/4 & e & 5e/4 & 3e/2 & 7e/4 +    [ t_spin ]    the quantum dimensions of the @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( even @xmath52 ) anyons are @xmath45 and that of the @xmath57 ( odd @xmath52 ) anyons are @xmath44",
    ". the particle and anti - particle pairs in the t - pfaffian theory are i_k ~i_(8-k )  8 , _ k ~_(8-k )  8 , _ k ~_(8-k )  8 obviously @xmath58 is the vacuum in the theory .",
    "moreover , it is easy to check that a full braiding of @xmath59 around any other particle in the theory leads to a phase factor of @xmath45 .",
    "that is , the @xmath59 particle is a local excitation of the system and can not be seen by a braiding operation far away .",
    "in fact , @xmath59 has topological spin of @xmath46 , carries charge @xmath17 and is therefore the electron in the system .",
    "note that while the t - pfaffian state has the same anyon types as the pfaffian state , the statistics of the two are different .",
    "in particular , the the statistics of the ising part is taken to be the complex conjugate of that in pfaffian .",
    "therefore , for example , the topological spin of the @xmath60 anyon is @xmath45 in the t - pfaffian theory while it is @xmath61 in the pfaffian theory .",
    "is it possible to realize the t - pfaffian topological order in a time reversal invariant system ?    for pure 2d system , the answer is no .",
    "this is easy to see if we look at the edge of the system .",
    "the ising part of the theory has chiral central charge @xmath62 and is neutral , hence does not contribute to charge hall conductance @xmath63 . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath38 part of the theory has chiral central charge @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "therefore , the t - pfaffian theory has total chiral central charge @xmath66 and charge hall conductance @xmath65 .",
    "obviously this is not possible in a pure 2d system with time reversal symmetry .",
    "however , such argument fails if the t - pfaffian theory is realized on the surface of a 3d gapped system , because the 2d surface of a 3d system does not have an edge of its own .",
    "therefore , the chiral edge of the t - pfaffian state no longer presents an obstruction to realization in a time reversal invariant system . on the surface of a 3d system",
    ", we can only probe how time reversal symmetry acts on the excitations in the bulk of the 2d system , namely the anyons .",
    "first , the action of time reversal symmetry takes complex conjugation of all the braiding and fusion processes among the anyons .",
    "moreover , time reversal symmetry can map one anyon type to another .",
    "therefore , if the t - pfaffian theory can be realized on the surface of a 3d time reversal invariant system , then the time reversal symmetry must exchange the anyon types in such a way that the fusion and braiding amplitudes are invariant under both complex conjugation and this exchange of anyon types .",
    "such an exchange of anyon type does seem to exist if we consider the topological spins of the anyons , which describe the self rotating processes of the anyons . from eqn.[t_spin ] , we can see that the topological spins remain invariant if the time reversal symmetry performs the following exchange i_2 _ 2 ,  i_6 _ 6 together with taking complex conjugation .",
    "compare to the pfaffian state where such an exchange of anyon type , hence time reversal symmetry , can not exist .",
    "in particular , the topological spins for the four @xmath41 anyons in the pfaffian theory are _ _ 1=e^i , _ _ 3=e^i , _ _ 5=e^i , _ _ 7=e^i , which do not form time reversal invariant pairs .",
    "moreover , we can check that the exchanges @xmath67 with @xmath68 and @xmath69 with @xmath70 is consistent with the fusion rules of the t - pfaffian theory .",
    "for example , the fusion process of i_2 _ 4 = _ 6 is mapped to _ 2 _ 4 = i_6 under this exchange , which is again a valid fusion process in the t - pfaffian theory .",
    "therefore , we have found an exchange of anyon types which , together with complex conjugation , keeps the fusion rules and the topological spins of the t - pfaffian theory invariant .",
    "the exchange of anyon types , however , does not completely specify the action of time reversal symmetry on the t - pfaffian state .",
    "in particular , for anyon types which do not change under time reversal , one can ask whether time reversal acts as @xmath71 or @xmath46 on the anyon locally . this is a legitimate question to ask , because away from the anyonic excitations , the state remains invariant under time reversal .",
    "if anyon types does not change under time reversal , then time reversal acts effectively locally around the anyon . as shown in",
    ", the local action of time reversal can only square to @xmath45 or @xmath46 .",
    "if @xmath72 on a particular anyon , then then anyon has an extra spin label and leads to a local @xmath73 fold degeneracy under time reversal symmetry when it is separated from all other anyons . on the other hand ,",
    "if the anyon changes type under time reversal , then the effective action of time reversal is nonlocal on the state and it is not well defined to talk about @xmath74 locally for the anyon .",
    "the local time reversal symmetry action represented by this @xmath75 information is important because with different local action , the topological state can correspond to totally different bulk phase .",
    "for example , the statistics of @xmath11 gauge theory with anyons @xmath76 is time reversal invariant with no exchange of anyons . if the two bosonic particles @xmath17 and @xmath77 both transform as @xmath71 , the state can be realized in 2d time reversal invariant system . however , if they both transform as @xmath72 , the state can only be realized on the surface of 3d bosonic topological superconductors@xcite . for the t - pfaffian state , we would be interested in the @xmath74 transformation for the charged boson @xmath78 , the chargeless fermion @xmath79 , the electron @xmath59 and all the nonabelian @xmath57 particles .",
    "in particular , the @xmath74 transformation of @xmath59 would tell us whether we are dealing with a @xmath71 or @xmath46 topological insulator .    in this section , we state the general rules for determine the @xmath74 information for anyons .",
    "we give the motivation for setting these rules and apply them to the t - pfaffian state . in appendix [ fr_t ] , we will provide an algebraic proof for these rules in terms of the exactly solvable walker - wang model realizing the particular topological state on the surface .",
    "the local action of time reversal on the anyons can be determined from the following two rules that applies to both abelian and non - abelian anyons :    * * rule 1 : * if anyons @xmath80 and @xmath81 fuse into @xmath52 and none of @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath52 change type under time reversal , then @xmath82 . * * rule 2 : * if @xmath80 maps into @xmath83 ( different from @xmath80 ) under time reversal and the braiding of @xmath80 around @xmath83 in the fusion channel @xmath52 resulting in a phase factor of @xmath84 , then @xmath85 .    the first rule comes from considering a region with two anyons @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "if @xmath80 and @xmath81 are separated far enough ( larger than correlation length ) , then they each have well defined @xmath74 .",
    "the total local time reversal symmetry action on the whole region is composed of that on @xmath80 and @xmath81 separately .",
    "however , for an observer very far away from this region , the total anyonic charge in the region is @xmath52 .",
    "therefore , @xmath86 .",
    "note that one consequence of this rule is that a particle and its antiparticle have the same @xmath74 .",
    "the second rule comes from considering a region with @xmath80 and @xmath83 . applying time reversal , @xmath80 changes into @xmath83 and vice versa .",
    "this is equivalent to rotating the @xmath87 pair by @xmath88 degree . applying time reversal twice",
    ", we have rotated the pair by @xmath89 degree which is equivalent to a full braiding of @xmath80 around @xmath83 and results in a phase factor of @xmath84 . however , for an observer far away from this region , the total anyonic charge in the region is @xmath52 and the @xmath84 phase factor comes from @xmath90 .    applying these two rules",
    ", we can find out possible @xmath74 action on each anyon locally .",
    "there may be more than one set of @xmath74 values for all the anyons satisfying these rules .",
    "let s now apply these rules to t - pfaffian and determine the local time reversal symmetry action .",
    "first of all , the electron @xmath59 is the fusion product of @xmath67 and @xmath68 which map into each other under time reversal . because the braiding of @xmath67 around @xmath68 gives a @xmath46 , @xmath59",
    "transform as @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , we are indeed dealing with a @xmath72 topological insulator .",
    "next , because @xmath60 and @xmath91 can fuse both to @xmath59 and @xmath78 and they do not change type under time reversal , using the first rule we find that @xmath78 transforms in the same way as @xmath59 .",
    "that is , @xmath72 for the charged boson .",
    "from this , we can easily tell that @xmath79 , the chargeless fermion , transforms as @xmath71 .",
    "finally , @xmath92 have the same @xmath93 , while @xmath94 have @xmath95 .",
    "this information is summarized in the following table of @xmath74 values :     i & 1 & & & & -1 & & & + & & & & - & & - & & + & 1 & & & & -1 & & & +    [ t_tsquared ]    _ two t - pfaffians : _ hence there are two possible ways that time reversal symmetry can act on the t - pfaffian state , labeled with @xmath96 .",
    "these two states can be mapped into each other by combining with the following @xmath11 gauge theory .",
    "consider a @xmath11 gauge theory where the gauge charge @xmath97 and the gauge flux @xmath98 both transform as @xmath72 and @xmath97 carries @xmath1 charge @xmath46 ( in units of the electron charge ) while @xmath98 is neutral .",
    "this particular @xmath11 gauge theory can not be realized in a purely 2d system as discussed in ref.@xcite , where it was termed the etmt state , and realizes the surface topological order of a bosonic spt phase protected by time reversal symmetry ( charge attached to the @xmath97 particle is an unimportant difference ) .",
    "bring such a @xmath11 gauge theory on top of the @xmath99 t - pfaffian state and condense the boson pair @xmath100 .",
    "the combination of @xmath97 and @xmath78 is charge neutral and transforms as @xmath71 , therefore , the condensate preserves both symmetries . after the condensation , the gauge flux @xmath98 gets bounded to the @xmath101 particles in the t - pfaffian state in order to commute with the condensate while all the abelian particles in the t - pfaffian state remains .",
    "therefore , the particle content in the resulting theory is the same as the original t - pfaffian state , but the time reversal representation of the @xmath101 particles change from @xmath99 to @xmath25 .",
    "the @xmath1 charge carried by the particles remains the same .",
    "thus , these two states differ by a particular bosonic topological superconductor .",
    "from the discussion in the previous sections we see that a possible definition of time reversal and charge conservation symmetry action does exist for the anyonic excitations in the t - pfaffian state .",
    "therefore , the t - pfaffian state could potentially be realized on the surface of 3d systems with@xmath0 and charge conservation symmetry , although not in purely 2d due to the chiral edge modes in t - pfaffian . in the next section ,",
    "we show that such a 3d realization indeed exists by presenting an exactly solvable model using the walker - wang construction@xcite . due to the nontrivial symmetry action in t - pfaffian",
    ", the 3d bulk of the system must have some nontrivial symmetry protected topological order .",
    "that is , the model is a 3d topological insulator .",
    "but is it _ the _ topological insulator realized in free fermion systems or some other previously unknown topological insulator which is only possible in strongly interacting systems ?    to answer this question definitely , we would need to find some topological invariants for different topological insulators and compute them for this system .",
    "however , we do not know how to do this . in the following",
    ", we will check certain properties of this model and see if it is consistent with what we know about the free fermion topological insulator .",
    "we find that : 1 .",
    "two copies of t - pfaffian is trivial which is consistent with the @xmath11 classification of the free fermion topological insulator ; 2 . by breaking time reversal but not charge conservation symmetry , the topological order can be removed .",
    "now , surface domain walls between regions with opposite @xmath0 breaking carry gapless 1d modes with @xmath64 and @xmath102 , which is known to happen in the free fermion topological insulator .",
    "this also implies @xmath3 ; 3 . for one of the t - pfaffian states ( @xmath99 or @xmath46 ) , the topological order can be removed by breaking charge conservation but not time reversal symmetry , a property expected for free fermion topological insulator surface states .",
    "while we do not explicitly construct the route to removing topological order , we demonstrate this to be a logical consequence .",
    "the free fermion topological insulator ( ti ) has a @xmath11 classification .",
    "that is , if we take two copies of the free fermion ti and allow interactions between them the surface state can be made trivial without breaking either time reversal or charge conservation symmetry .",
    "therefore , if the t - pfaffian state is realized on the surface of the free fermion ti , we should be able to take two copies of it and removed the topological order without breaking time reversal or charge conservation symmetry .",
    "this is indeed the case as we show below .",
    "suppose that we have two t - pfaffian states whose anyons are labeled as @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "we can condense the following set of composite bosonic particles without breaking time reversal or charge conservation : i_2_6,_2_6,i_6_2,_6_2,i_4_4,_0_0,_4_4 note first that each composite particle listed above has bosonic self and mutual statistics , therefore they can be condensed together .",
    "also , each composite particle has charge @xmath105 , hence condensing them does not break charge conservation .",
    "moreover , the composite particles either map to themselves under time reversal or appear in time reversal pairs . finally , they all transform as @xmath71 under time reversal .",
    "therefore , the condensate does not break time reversal either .",

    "because the modularized t - pfaffian theories are nonchiral , they must belong to either the trivial or the nontrivial case of the second @xmath11 ( i.e. etmt surface topological order ) .",

    "now bring the modularized t - pfaffian state ( complex conjugated ) on top of the corresponding t - pfaffian state .",
    "condense fermion - fermion pair to confine the @xmath11 gauge field and we obtain a doubled t - pfaffian theory . the topological order in this doubled theory",
    "can be completely removed by condensing pairs of corresponding particles , e.g. @xmath121 , which does not violate time reversal symmetry .",
    "therefore , for one of the t - pfaffians , the surface topological order can be removed through combination with a 2d @xmath122 invariant topological state and condensing bosons in a time reversal invariant way .",
    "therefore , we can conclude from the previous analysis that one of the t - pfaffian states , on breaking charge conservation symmetry , is equivalent to the superconducting surface of the free fermion topological insulator , while the other differs from it by a bosonic topological superconductor ( with surface topological order etmt ) .",

    "the ambiguity here is whether the t - pfaffian(s ) describe a mixture of the free fermionic topological insulator with 3d bosonic spt phases .",
    "we can prove that there is a t - pfaffian state which is to be identified with the free fermion ti , with no bosonic spt mixture assuming the classification result above .",

    "the root states in terms of surface topological order are ( i ) three fermion state ( ii ) the toric code with @xmath17 and @xmath77 transforming as @xmath72 ( etmt state ) and ( iii ) the toric code where both @xmath17 and @xmath77 are charge @xmath127 of the cooper pair . however ,",
    "in the presence of electrons the classification is reduced to @xmath125 for these bosonic spts .",
    "one can combine say the electron with ( iii ) to obtain a mixture of ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "therefore one can take the two neutral states ( i ) and ( ii ) as the relevant topological orders @xcite .",
    "the remaining question is - is the t - pfaffian a mixture of fermionic ti and one or both of the bosonic spts ( i ) , ( ii ) ?",
    "note , if it is a mixture , then breaking charge conservation symmetry is not sufficient to eliminate the topological order .",
    "the t - pfaffian can not contain the state ( i ) since t - pfaffian has @xmath128 and @xmath129 in one realization while the mixture with state ( i ) would have an additional thermal hall conductivity of @xmath130 , while retaining the same charge hall conductivity . here",
    "@xmath131 and @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the lorentz number and @xmath134 is the temperature .    therefore the t - pfaffian can at best differ from the free fermion ti by the etmt state ( ii ) .",
    "however , the two versions of the t - pfaffian differ from one another by exactly this state , which has a @xmath11 classification .",
    "hence one of the two t - pfaffian states represents the surface of the free fermion ti .",
    "in this section , we construct the 3d model with time reversal symmetry which realizes the t - pfaffian theory on its surface and have time reversal acting in the way expected . in section [ wwa ] , we introduce the basic idea of the walker wang construction and explain in section [ wwt ] how it allows us to determine the local time reversal symmetry transformation ( @xmath75 ) for the anyons .",
    "we try to first present the basic picture and the general idea underlying the walker wang construction in this section without going into too much details , which is saved for section [ wwd ] where we give the exactly solvable hamiltonian and address some related subtleties .",

    ", we are not going to explain all the details related to the exactly solvable hamiltonian , but only focus on the basic idea of the walker - wang construction and show how it allows us to determine that @xmath72 for the electrons .",
    "( @xmath74 for other anyons can also be determined . )",
    "the basic idea underlying the walker - wang construction is very intuitive .",
    "the model is constructed such that the ground state wave function is a superposition of 3d loops ( more precisely ` string nets ' , in the sense of @xcite ) labeled by the anyon types , which describes the 2 + 1d space time trajectory of the anyons .",
    "the amplitude for a given configuration of these loops @xmath135 in the 3 + 1d wave function @xmath136 is determined by the expectation value of the corresponding wilson loop operators in the 2 + 1d tqft ( topological quantum field theory ) which describes how the anyon world lines twist and intertwine with each other ; i.e. we have : _",
    "3d(c ) = w(c)_2 + 1tqft [ ground_state ] this is similar in spirit to eg . quantum hall wave functions , which are related to the space - time correlations of their edge states . here , since we demand a topologically ordered boundary state , the expectation values are taken in the boundary tqft .",
    "the wave function for the t - pfaffian walker - wang model hence contains 12 different string types corresponding to the 12 different anyons in the theory which can braid and fuse according to the fusion rules of t - pfaffian .",
    "the strings have directions .",
    "if the direction of a string related to anyon @xmath80 is reversed , it becomes a string related to the anti - particle , @xmath137 .",
    "since the twisting and intertwining of the anyon world lines may depend on the angle of view , in order to calculate the amplitude of the string - net configurations , we need to pick a particular projection of the 3d loops onto a 2d surface .",
    "the projection we will use is also shown in fig.[trivalent_lattice ] .",
    "having fixed a projection , the amplitude of each configuration can be obtained using the braiding and fusion rules given by the @xmath28 and @xmath29 matrix of the t - pfaffian theory , which is the product of the @xmath28 and @xmath29 matrices of the ising part and the @xmath38 part .",
    "the @xmath28 matrix for the ising part reads    l r^i,*_*=r^*,i_*=1 , r^,_i = e^i , r^,_=e^-i + r^,_=r^,_=i , r^,_i=-1    the @xmath28 matrix in the @xmath1 part is r^k_1,k_2_(k_1+k_2 )  8=e^ik_1k_2    the @xmath29 matrix for the ising part is    l _ , =    1 & 1 + 1 & -1     + _ , = _ , = -1    where @xmath138 .",

    "then we can check the statistics of the excitations by tracking these open strings .",
    "suppose we exchange two string ends of the same type @xmath140 ( as show in fig.[surface_anyon ] ( a ) ) by crossing two red string segments on the surface .",

    "open strings in the bulk also create excitations in the ground state . however ,",
    "if the corresponding anyon has nontrivial braiding with any other anyon , the excitation energy grows linearly with the string length , leading to confinement of the particles at the ends of the strings . to see the confinement , consider an open string of type @xmath140 ( colored blue ) in the bulk which is circled by a small ring of a different string type @xmath141 ( colored red ) , as shown in fig.[confinement ]     has nontrivial braiding with some other anyon @xmath141 , then the open string of type @xmath140 in the bulk can change the quantum fluctuation phase factors of @xmath141 loops along its length , which costs finite energy . therefore ,",

    "otherwise , the end of string of type @xmath140 is a deconfined point excitation , which must be either bosonic or fermionic in a 3d system . ]    using the braiding rule between the loops we find that the linking between the ring and the open string can be removed together with a phase factor s_,= _ d _ r^|_r^| _ where @xmath143 is the fusion product of @xmath140 and @xmath141 , @xmath144 is its quantum dimension and @xmath145 . if @xmath146 , the open string changes the quantum fluctuation phase factors of small loops along its length , which costs finite energy .",
    "therefore , the string s endpoints can not be separated very far , and the corresponding anyonic excitations in the bulk are confined . if @xmath147 for all @xmath141 , then the end of string of type @xmath140 can be a deconfined point excitation in the 3d bulk of the system , which has to be either a boson or a fermion .",
    "in the t - pfaffian state , all anyons have nontrivial braiding with some other anyon except the electron @xmath78 .",

    "<S> it was previously believed that a gapped surface implied breaking of either time reversal @xmath0 or @xmath1 charge conservation symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> here we discuss a novel possibility in the presence of interactions , a surface phase that preserves all symmetries but is nevertheless gapped and insulating . </S>",
    "<S> then the surface must develop topological order of a kind that can not be realized in a 2d system with the same symmetries . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss candidate surface states - non - abelian quantum hall states which , when realized in 2d , have @xmath2 and hence break @xmath0 symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> however , by constructing an exactly soluble 3d lattice model , we show they can be realized as @xmath0 symmetric surface states . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding 3d phases are confined , and have @xmath3 magnetoelectric response . </S>",
    "<S> two candidate states have the same 12 particle topological order , the ( read - moore ) pfaffian state with the neutral sector reversed , which we term t - pfaffian topological order , but differ in their @xmath0 transformation . </S>",
    "<S> although we are unable to connect either of these states directly to the superconducting ti surface , we argue that one of them describes the 3d ti surface , while the other differs from it by a bosonic topological phase . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the 24 particle pfaffian - antisemion topological order ( which can be connected to the superconducting ti surface ) and demonstrate that it can be realized as a @xmath0 symmetric surface state . </S>"
