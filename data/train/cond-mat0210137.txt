    "there has recently been a growth of interest in studying the pair distribution function , @xmath0 , in electron gas models,@xcite caused mainly by its relevance in non - local density functional theories .",

    "@xcite the importance of @xmath0 lies in its connection with the electronic exchange and correlation of the electron gas model .",
    "moreover , theoretical calculations of the pair distribution function can be directly compared with material properties since @xmath0 is the fourier transform of the static structure factor .",

    "the subject of this paper is an analysis of the pair correlation function dependence on the inter - electronic distance and electron density in a two dimensional , interacting , spin polarized electron system .",

    "et  al._@xcite    in order to calculate @xmath0 , we follow the approach developed in three dimensional systems by overhauser @xcite and further refined in ref .   and .",
    "this method is based on the relation between @xmath0 and the two - electron scattering problem in an appropriately chosen effective potential which will be discussed in detail in the following sections .",
    "in addition to obtaining the variation of the pair distribution function as a function of the coupling - strength , @xmath1 , and of the spin polarization , we also derive an analytic expression for @xmath2 : g(0)=. [ eq : corr2nd ] this expression is found to agree very well with the results of the most recent numerical calculations.@xcite we also compare our results with the expression derived in ref .  .",
