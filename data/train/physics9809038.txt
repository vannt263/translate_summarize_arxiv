    "very long fabry - perot cavities serve as measuring devices for interferometric gravitational wave detectors .",
    "several such detectors are currently under construction @xcite .",
    "the cavities are planned to have high circulating power and large storage time .",
    "for example , ligo ( laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory ) fabry - perot cavities will accumulate 10 kw of power and will have roughly 1 ms of storage time .    the suspended mirrors are designed to move freely along the direction of the beam propagation .",
    "due to multi - beam interference in the fabry - perot cavity the motion of the mirrors strongly affects the light inside the cavity .",
    "the light , in turn , affects the motion of the mirrors by exerting radiation pressure on them .",
    "the interaction of light in the cavity with the suspended mirrors through radiation pressure gives rise to a nonlinear dynamics .",
    "finite time of light propagation in the cavity introduces a time delay in the dynamics .",
    "the propagation time gives rise to storage time .",
    "thus a fabry - perot cavity is a dynamical system with delay ; such systems are known to have instabilities @xcite .",
    "the significance of the `` spring '' action and the `` damping '' effect of the radiation pressure for the dynamics of the fabry - perot cavity was pointed out by braginskii @xcite .",
    "the cavity with one suspended mirror driven by radiation pressure was studied experimentally by dorsel et al @xcite .",
    "the main results reported in these papers are observations of optical bistability and mirror oscillations with frequencies determined by the radiation pressure .",
    "these authors analyzed their results using the adiabatic approximation for the intra - cavity field . at about the same time",
    "deruelle and tourrenc studied the fabry - perot cavity with suspended mirrors theoretically @xcite .",
    "their analysis revealed delay - induced instability caused by the radiation pressure in the cavity .",
    "this instability was further studied by other researchers @xcite .",
    "stabilization of the fabry - perot cavity by a control system was discussed by meers and macdonald @xcite .",
    "recently , the radiation pressure induced dynamics of fabry - perot cavities attracted attention of the virgo group in connection with the design of the length control system of their detector @xcite .",
    "similar research has been done in ligo and is presented in this paper .",
    "emerging laser gravitational wave detectors require detailed modeling and pose new questions for the study of dynamics . from a phenomenological point of view",
    ", there is a question of what are the parameters that define the universal properties of fabry - perot cavities with suspended mirrors , and how the dynamics changes with respect to these parameters . from a point of view of applications , there is a question of how to generalize the results obtained in table - top experiments to large scale fabry - perot cavities of the gravitational wave detectors .    in this paper",
    "we attempt to provide a phenomenology of the fabry - perot cavities for modeling and optimization of the performance of ligo interferometers . due to the complexity of the subject we split the discussion into two papers . in the first paper we study various aspects of the nonlinearity in the dynamics , leaving aside the time delay instabilities . in the second paper @xcite",
    "we consider the time delay instabilities and study the dynamics of a fabry - perot cavity with a realistic control system .    in this paper",
    "we formulate the dynamics in terms of normal coordinates : the cavity length and the cavity center of mass .",
    "we show that a small part of the radiation pressure in the cavity , the excess force , excites the cavity center of mass . in absence of the excess radiation pressure ,",
    "the dynamics of the cavity length is equivalent to the dynamics of a suspended mirror in a cavity , which has one mirror suspended and one mirror fixed . to study the universal properties of the cavity dynamics , such as multistability",
    ", we introduce two parameters .",
    "the first parameter is a control parameter which allows us to select the equilibrium state .",
    "the second parameter characterizes strength of the radiation pressure and determines whether the system is stable or multistable and how many equilibrium states are there .",
    "the results obtained in this paper are general and apply to any fabry - perot cavity with suspended mirrors .",
    "numerical calculations and modeling with parameters of ligo cavities are given throughout this paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the equations of motion and define the control parameter . in section 3",
    "we formulate the dynamics in normal coordinates . in section 4",
    "we construct equilibrium states and introduce the specific radiation pressure . in section 5 hysteresis and instabilities are described . in section 6 the global properties of the dynamics are analyzed in terms of the effective potential . in section 7",
    "we provide explicit formulas and numerical values for the cavity resonant frequencies . in section 8",
    "we briefly describe nonlinear dynamics of the cavity with a control system .",
    "the dynamical system we study in this paper is a fabry - perot cavity with two suspended mirrors , labeled by @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and a laser incident on the cavity from one side .",
    "a suspended mirror is a rigid body with six degrees of freedom , whose dynamics depends on the suspension design . in this paper",
    "we neglect angular degrees of freedom of the mirrors and consider only the motion of their center of mass .",
    "we also neglect the side motion of the mirrors . in this approximation",
    "the mirrors are always aligned to the incident beam and move parallel to themselves as simple pendula .",
    "we specify the mirror positions by their coordinates , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , in the inertial coordinate frames as shown on figure  [ coords ] .",
    "the mirror suspension points are also moving , their coordinates are @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the two inertial coordinate frames are separated by a large distance , the nominal cavity length , @xmath6 , which we consider fixed .",
    "the actual length of the cavity depends on mirror positions in their respective coordinate frames : @xmath7 the large cavity length of the gravitational wave detectors makes the delay time , @xmath8 to be non - negligible .",
    "for example , in ligo interferometers the cavities are 4 km long and the corresponding delay time is roughly 13 @xmath9s .",
    "multibeam interference of laser in long fabry - perot cavities of gravitational wave detectors is far more complex than a similar process in short fabry - perot interferometers with fixed length which are commonly used for laser spectroscopy .",
    "both the motion of suspended mirrors and the delay times affect the interference and give rise to a complex dynamics .",
    "we describe dynamics of the laser in the cavity in terms of complex amplitudes of the electric field .",
    "these complex amplitudes correspond to the traveling electro - magnetic waves and are defined at some locations .",
    "usually the amplitudes are defined at the mirror surfaces .",
    "however , the suspended mirrors are moving and such a choice would require account for doppler effects .",
    "instead , we define the amplitudes at the reference planes which are fixed in the inertial coordinate frames .",
    "our notations for the amplitudes of the electro - magnetic waves are shown in fig .",
    "[ fields ] .",
    "the amplitude of the wave , incident on the front mirror , is @xmath10 .",
    "the amplitudes of the forward - propagating wave inside the cavity , defined at the two reference planes , are @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "similarly , the amplitudes of the backward - propagating wave are @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the amplitudes of the cavity transmitted and reflected waves are @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "propagation of the laser inside the cavity is described by the delay equations : @xmath17 these and other equations for the complex amplitudes are derived in the appendix  [ defe ] .",
    "the equations for reflection and transmission of the laser at the end mirror are : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the reflectivity and @xmath20 is the transmissivity of the end mirror .    using the superposition principle we obtain similar equations for the front mirror : @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the reflectivity and the transmissivity of the front mirror .",
    "numerical values for the reflectivities and the trasmissivities of the mirrors in ligo cavities are given in the appendix  [ cavpar ] .",
    "the equations ( [ ep1]-[e4 ] ) describe dynamics of the laser interacting with the moving mirrors of the cavity .",
    "these equations can be reduced to one equation with one field , which is called the self - consistent field .",
    "all other fields can be expressed in terms of the self - consistent field through the field equations above .",
    "we choose the forward - propagating field to be the self - consistent field .",
    "let the amplitude of the self - consistent field be @xmath24 ( same as @xmath25 ) .",
    "then the equation for dynamics of the self - consistent field is @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the relative mirror position defined as @xmath28 the quantity , @xmath29 , is the distance between the mirrors in relativistic sense .",
    "since the speed of light is finite we can not obtain information about the instantaneous cavity length defined in eq .",
    "( [ linst ] ) .",
    "however , we can measure the relativistic cavity length , @xmath27 , by observation of one of the cavity fields .",
    "this can be done using the pound - drever signal extraction scheme .",
    "the pound - drever signal is based on observation of the cavity reflected laser @xmath30 which is defined in terms of the self - consistent field and , therefore , depends on the cavity length , @xmath27 .    in the expression , eq .",
    "( [ xdef ] ) , the delay appears in the coordinate of the end and not the front mirror .",
    "this is because upon entering the cavity the laser first reflects off the end mirror and then reflects off the front mirror .",
    "dynamics of the suspended mirrors is defined by the forces acting on them . since we analyze only longitudinal motion of the mirrors we consider only horizontal components of the forces .",
    "the horizontal component of the wire tension , acting on the front mirror , is @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the mass of the front mirror and @xmath33 is the pendulum frequency .",
    "there is a similar expression for the end mirror .",
    "the laser circulating in the cavity and the incident laser exert pressure on the mirrors .",
    "let the radiation pressure on the front and the end mirror be @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "these forces are defined by the amplitudes of the fields as follows : @xmath36 many control schemes , including the control system of ligo arm cavities , require actuators on the mirrors .",
    "the actuators can be coil - magnet pairs , electro - static boards or other devices . for our analysis",
    "the details of the actuators are not important .",
    "we only assume that actuators are perfectly aligned and apply forces to the mirrors in the direction of the beam propagation .",
    "let the actuator forces be @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "there is also a friction force due to energy losses in the suspension wires and the actuators .",
    "we assume that the friction is proportional to velocity .",
    "then the friction force acting on the front mirror can be written as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the damping coefficient .",
    "a similar expression can be obtained for the end mirror .",
    "typically the damping coefficient is very small : @xmath41 .",
    "numerical values for the parameters of ligo interferometers are given in appendix  [ cavpar ] .",
    "let us consider the sum of the pendulum restoring force and the actuator force for the front mirror : @xmath42 there are two parameters here : the position of the suspension point and the actuator force .",
    "the mirror can be controlled through both the actuator and the suspension point .",
    "however , the dynamics depends only on the sum of the two parameters , and not separately on each one .",
    "therefore , we combine the two parameters into a new parameter @xmath43 this is the control parameter for the front mirror .",
    "a similar parameter , @xmath44 , can be introduced for the end mirror .",
    "the control parameter has dimension of length and the meaning of an equivalent displacement of the suspension point .",
    "the equivalence is based on the conversion factor @xmath45 , which for ligo is roughly 4.2 millimeter per newton of the actuator force .",
    "moving the suspended mirrors at high frequencies is easier using the actuator .",
    "however , applying large displacements to the mirror at low frequencies is better through the suspension point .",
    "therefore in a realistic control system the control parameter , @xmath46 , may obtain its high frequency component from the actuator force and its low frequency component from the position of the suspension point .",
    "the equations of motion for the mirrors are @xmath47 these are the equations for a pair of damped harmonic oscillators driven by forces of the radiation pressure .",
    "the oscillators are not independent : they are interacting with each other through the laser which acts as a spring connecting the mirrors .",
    "the `` spring '' is nonlinear and has time delay .",
    "a fabry - perot cavity has two intrinsic time scales : one is the delay time , @xmath48 , the other is the storage time @xmath49 correspondingly , there are two intrinsic frequencies defined by the cavity : the free spectral range ( @xmath50 ) and the cavity low pass frequency @xmath51 therefore , there are three dynamical regimes for the fabry - perot cavity .",
    "let @xmath52 be a characteristic time for a dynamic process involving changes in the mirror positions and fields .",
    "let @xmath53 be the characteristic frequencies of the process .",
    "the three regimes are :    1 .",
    "decoupled regime : @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) , 2 .   delay regime : @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) , 3 .",
    "adiabatic regime : @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "the first regime corresponds to very fast changes in mirror positions and fields in the fabry - perot cavity .",
    "the decoupled regime can be understood on the following example .",
    "first the mirrors are at rest .",
    "then one mirror acquires some velocity , changes its position and stops . if the entire process takes time less than @xmath48 the second mirror becomes affected by the process after the first mirror comes to rest .",
    "therefore , during such process the mirrors are independent of each other .",
    "this is nothing but a relativistic causality limit . in ligo interferometers",
    "the processes with frequencies above 37.5 khz belong to the decoupled regime .",
    "the second regime takes place when the changes in the mirror position are faster than transient processes in the cavity but not fast enough to decouple the mirrors . in this regime",
    "the transients caused by the mirror motion never die and the cavity never reaches equilibrium . in such a regime the motion of one mirror is constantly affected by the other mirror and the delays play crucial role .",
    "dynamic processses in ligo cavities with frequencies between 100 hz and 10 khz belong to this regime .",
    "the third regime takes place when the mirrors move so slow that the laser transients can be neglected . in this case",
    "we can think of the laser circulating in the cavity as being in equilibrium with the mirrors .",
    "this is the adiabatic regime . in this regime",
    "the delays are not important .",
    "the adiabatic regime takes place in ligo cavities at frequencies less than 100 hz .      in the adiabatic regime",
    "the mirror motion is so slow that we can neglect the delay time in the equation for the self - consistent field eq .",
    "( [ selfcon ] ) and obtain a solution : @xmath60 the value of the field in the adiabatic regime is completely defined by the current value of the cavity length , @xmath27 .",
    "the power in the cavity , which we define as the momentum carried by the forward - propagating wave ( @xmath61 ) is also a function of the cavity length .",
    "the maximum power , @xmath62 , depends on the mirror parameters and defines the cavity gain : @xmath63 the power as a function of length is described by the airy formula @xmath64 also known as airy intensity profile ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the constant , @xmath65 , is the coefficient of finesse @xmath66 the relation between the parameter , @xmath65 , and the finesse of fabry - perot cavity is given in appendix  [ airy ] .",
    "the suspended mirrors are interacting with each other through the laser in the cavity .",
    "therefore , the degrees of freedom which correspond to the mirrors are coupled .",
    "however , we can formulate the dynamics in terms of new degrees of freedom which are largely independent of each other .",
    "these new degrees of freedom are similar to the normal coordinates usually appeared in theory of coupled linear oscillators . before we formulate the dynamics in terms of the normal coordinates we reduce the number of fields entering the general expressions for the radiation pressure on the mirrors , equations  ( [ ra]-[rb ] ) .    the radiation pressure on the end mirror , eq .",
    "( [ rb ] ) can be expressed entirely in terms of the self - consistent field : @xmath67 the radiation pressure on the front mirror is produced by the laser circulating in the cavity and the laser incident on the cavity , eq .",
    "( [ ra ] ) .",
    "a constant flux of the incident laser produces constant radiation pressure on the front mirror : @xmath68 therefore , we can write the radiation pressure on the front mirror as the sum : @xmath69 in this equation the first term implies that the same force which is pushing the end mirror now will be pushing the front mirror in the opposite direction after time @xmath48 .",
    "the second term is proportional to the power of the incident laser and accounts for the constant radiation pressure from outside the cavity .",
    "the last term , @xmath70 , which can be called the excess radiation pressure , accounts for the asymmetry between the mirrors and the interference between the incident laser and the laser circulating in the cavity .",
    "the excess force can also be expressed entirely in terms of the self - consistent field and the cavity length : @xmath71 where @xmath72 , and the asterisk stands for complex conjugation .    in the adiabatic regime the excess force can be written explicitly as a function of length : @xmath73 numerical estimates with ligo parameters show that the excess radiation pressure , @xmath74 , is roughly four orders of magnitude less than the radiation pressure , @xmath35 .    the constant radiation pressure , eq .",
    "( [ rin ] ) , has no effect on the dynamics , but the excess force , eq .",
    "( [ dr ] ) , makes the radiation pressure on the mirrors unbalanced and affects the dynamics .",
    "the normal coordinates are the position of the center of mass and the cavity length : @xmath75 note that both normal coordinates are affected by the delay due to the finite time of laser propagation in the cavity .",
    "similarly , we introduce the control parameters for the new coordinates : @xmath76 to make the subsequent formulas simpler we hid the constant radiation pressure into the new control parameters .",
    "also we define the reduced mass in a usual way : @xmath77 in normal coordinates the dynamical equations are the equation for the center of mass and the equation for the cavity length : @xmath78 we see that the radiation pressure mostly affects one degree of freedom : the cavity length , @xmath27 .",
    "this is because the pressure on the front mirror is roughly equal and opposite to the pressure on the end mirror if we neglect the constant pressure from outside .",
    "the motion of the center of mass is affected by the radiation pressure only through the excess force .",
    "dynamics of the center of mass of free cavity is defined exclusively by the excess radiation pressure , which , in turn , is defined by the cavity length , @xmath27 . as a result ,",
    "changes in the cavity length excite motion of the center of mass .",
    "on the contrary , arbitrary motion of center of mass has no effect on the cavity length .",
    "therefore we can ignore the dynamics of the center of mass and focus on the cavity length .",
    "however , few important points must be taken into account before we abandon the motion of the center of mass .",
    "although small motion of the center of mass ( @xmath79 m ) has no effect on the detector performance , large motion ( @xmath80 0.1 mm ) will cause variations of the actuator gains . therefore , the motion of the cavity center of mass must be suppressed to the extent defined by the actuator s range .",
    "in particular , we must avoid exciting the motion of the center of mass by a control system . in gravitational wave detectors",
    "the control system suppresses motion of the mirror under seismic disturbances by applying forces to the mirrors through the actuators .",
    "therefore the control system can excite the motion of the center of mass , unless the control signals are synchronized : @xmath81 unlike the cavity length the center of mass is not observable in a strict relativistic sense . to obtain information about the cavity s center of mass",
    "requires setting up an inertial frame , which is impossible for the ground based gravitational wave detectors .",
    "this poses a problem of observability for control of the fabry - perot cavity , which can be stated as follows .",
    "the cavity length is known with high precision ( better than @xmath82 m ) but the center of mass can only be measured approximately ( up to 1@xmath9 m ) .",
    "therefore the cavity length can only be controlled approximately . since the two degrees of freedom are largely independent poor observability and control of the center of mass do not affect the dynamics of the cavity length .",
    "therefore , as long as the motion of the center of mass remains small , it can be ignored .",
    "the degree of freedom most important for understanding the response of fabry - perot cavity as a part of the gravitational wave detector is the cavity length @xmath27 .    in the following discussion of the cavity length dynamics",
    "we neglect the excess radiation pressure , @xmath74 . to simplify following formulas",
    "we make the approximation : @xmath83 in the eq .",
    "[ rb2 ] and write the radiation pressure on the end mirror as @xmath84 this is a good approximation for high reflective mirrors , such as the end mirrors of ligo cavities .",
    "the dynamics of the cavity length is independent of the dynamics of the center of mass and can be studied separately .",
    "the equations for the cavity length dynamics include only the cavity length and the self - consistent field : @xmath85 the iteration equation  ( [ itereq ] ) allows us to calculate the amplitude @xmath24 at discrete times .",
    "the time step is the cavity round - trip time , @xmath86 .",
    "the value of the amplitude between the steps can be found by delaying its value at the last iteration .",
    "these equations are equivalent to the equations of the dynamics of the fabry - perot cavity with front mirror fixed and the end mirror suspended from wires , provided the mass of the end mirror is equal to the reduced mass .",
    "equilibrium states of the cavity are static solutions of the equations ( [ pendeq ] ) and ( [ itereq ] ) . for static states these equations simplify and can be written as @xmath87 the complex field , @xmath88 , can be eliminated from the equations  ( [ equilx ] ) and ( [ equile ] ) and the equilibrium condition can be written entirely in terms of the cavity length : @xmath89 here @xmath90 is the maximum radiation pressure on the end mirror which corresponds to the maximum power in the cavity : @xmath91 the equation  ( [ equilx ] ) shows that in equilibrium the radiation pressure is balanced by the pendulum restoring force .",
