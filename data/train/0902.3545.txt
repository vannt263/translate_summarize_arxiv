    "in low - dimensional electron systems @xcite the quantization of conductance @xcite is observed . for constrictions in two - dimensional electron gases",

    "single - atomic size contacts exhibit typical , reproducible and material dependent conductances , which , however , in general are no integer multiples of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the conductance is associated to an ensemble of transport channels , the number of which corresponds to the number of valence orbitals of the element used .",
    "the individual channel transmissions in the range @xmath2 reflect the wave - function overlap from the central to neighbouring and following atoms @xcite .",
    "although atomistic ab initio calculations greatly complement experiments in this field , they are not needed to deduce transport channels and their transmissions from measurements .",
    "the description using an ensemble of transport channels is a more general concept applicable to any sort of point contact @xcite .",
    "the contact - including leads to bulk electrodes - can be viewed as a black box that behaves like the associated ensemble of transport channels .",
    "a deeper interpretation of the channels is not required .",
    "we shortly review here , in our own way , the theoretical construction behind the description of a single contact in terms of a channel ensemble , because this basis is needed for generalizing the concept to the double junction .",
    "regarding the left and right side of a point contact as in fig.1a at first as uncoupled reservoirs let there be a finite number of orthonormal modes on each side ( 2 on the left and 3 on the right as depicted in fig.1b , for example ) .",
    "these may be localized atomic orbitals or band modes of a solid crystal .",
    "( small letters @xmath3 and @xmath4 are used here just to distinguish the single from the double junction . ) putting the left and right side together , scattering is determined by some complex amplitudes @xmath5 gathered into matrix @xmath6 ( fig.1c ) . the case that some modes may not couple is included .",
    "some entries @xmath5 may be zero .",
    "reverse scattering is given by the adjoint matrix ( fig.1d ) .",
    "not every matrix with as many lines as there are modes on one side and as many columns as there are modes on the other side can be a scattering matrix @xmath6 , though . probability conservation sets upper limits on the entries .",
    "a mandatory limit is , of course , that the absolute value of each entry be lower than or equal to 1 , @xmath7 for all @xmath8 .",
    "but then one could think at first glance that it would be sufficient to demand that a particle occupying a pure mode on one side after being scattered to the other side should not cause a probability exceeding 1 there , that is @xmath9 and then the other way round @xmath10 for every @xmath11 .",
    "an example showing that this is insufficient will be given in section 4 .",
    "for independent transport channels we want an input on the left to come back into the same eigenmode it came from there after having been scattered to the right and back .",
    "all further multiple reflections will then stay in this mode .",
    "the channels will therefore be determined by diagonalizing @xmath12 . by construction @xmath12",
    "is a hermitian matrix and thus has real eigenvalues . to ensure that the total probability does not increase it is required that any superposition of modes on the left described by a normalized distribution vector when scattered to the right and back is projected onto a mode distribution with total probability less than or at most 1 again on the left .",
    "the same , of course , has to hold true for starting with a normalized vector on the right and regarding the probability returning from one backreflection to the left .",
    "we shall show that the prohibition of probability creation in forth- and backreflections is equivalent to all eigenvalues of @xmath12 being less or equal to one . ",
    "all eigenvalues of @xmath12 @xmath13 1  is not a property to deduce of a scattering matrix @xmath6 , but the definition to put for calling a matrix @xmath6 a scattering matrix .",
    "in contrast to the usual scattering formalism @xcite we do not distinguish incoming and outgoing modes here .",
    "furthermore instead of two transmission and two reflection quadrants our _ scattering matrix _ @xmath6 only consists of one transmission block and only describes transmission from one side of the contact to the other , and therefore does not have to be square . the term _ modes _ or _ original modes _",
    "is used for states that conveniently describe the left and right side of the contact , which can be taken from the situation before a contact is established .",
    "we avoid the word  channel  for these , which is often used synonymous with incoming and outgoing modes @xcite because it is implied differently in the experiment - related description of atomic contacts @xcite .",
    "we call _ eigenmodes _ or _ new modes _ those linear combinations of original modes that constitute eigenvectors of @xmath12 or @xmath14 . eigenmodes on the left and the right side of a contact are associated to each other one to one and their connections are called _ transport channels _ or simply _",
    "channels_.    let @xmath15 denote the entries of the matrix @xmath16 such that each column of @xmath16 is a normalized eigenvector of @xmath12 .",
    "eigenvectors associated to eigenvalues zero have to be kept , and in case of degenerate eigenvalues choose a set of orthogonal eigenvectors associated to them .",
    "@xmath16 is a square matrix with the dimension the number of modes on the left .",
    "the orthonormality of the eigenvectors is expressed through @xmath17 any normalized input state on the left given by a distribution vector @xmath18 in the basis of the original modes can be converted into the basis of eigenvectors , where we shall call this same vector @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath16 is invertable .",
    "@xmath20 or @xmath21 . from @xmath22",
    "it easily follows that also @xmath23 and vice versa .",
    "the following calculation shows the above claimed equivalance about @xmath6 being a scattering matrix : @xmath24 @xmath25 expresses that the @xmath26th column of @xmath16 is the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue @xmath27 . of course ,",
    "@xmath28 , because eigenvalues are real , and ( 1 ) has been used .",
    "some normalized vector @xmath18 or equivalently any normalized vector @xmath19 can arbitrarily be chosen .",
    "@xmath19 could especially be a vector with any one component equal to 1 and all other components 0 .",
    "then obviously @xmath29 for every @xmath26 individually . to initialize the above calculation from the last line ,",
    "suppose that every @xmath30 is smaller or equal to 1 .",
    "then , for a general @xmath19 , ( 2 ) simply means weighing each term in the sum @xmath31 by a factor @xmath32 , which must give a result @xmath33 .",
    "having obtained the scattering amplitudes from a microscopic physical model should ensure @xmath6 being a scattering matrix and all eigenvalues of @xmath12 less or equal to 1 .",
    "however , and also because of the need to make up number examples here , an easier criterion than calculating all eigenvalues of @xmath12 would be helpful .",
    "@xmath34 is a sufficient condition , although not a necessary one .    as a further important aspect",
    "one may wonder whether defining transport channels as ( eigen-)modes from the right being backscattered only into themselves would have made a difference from having required this property for ( eigen-)modes on the left .",
    "this would mean looking for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath14 .",
    "as @xmath14 may have a different dimension from @xmath12 , one of these matrices may have more eigenvalues than the other one .",
    "the conjecture , that one might get a greater number of transport channels as well as channels with different transmissions with an ansatz looking at backscattering from one side instead of from the other , however , is wrong .",
    "we shall now demonstrate that , if @xmath14 is of greater dimension than @xmath12 , @xmath14 has all eigenvalues that @xmath12 has and all its remaining additional eigenvalues are zero .",
    "note again that columns of @xmath16 are the eigenvectors of @xmath12 : @xmath35 @xmath36 is the diagonal matrix containing the eigenvalues of @xmath12 in the order of the columns of @xmath16 . to get each column vector of @xmath16 multiplied by the respective @xmath27",
    ", @xmath36 has to be multiplied to @xmath16 from the right .",
    "@xmath12 , @xmath16 and @xmath36 are all square matrices with dimension the number of modes @xmath37 on the left side .",
    "now multiply ( 4 ) by @xmath6 from the left and as matrix multiplication is associative , we can view that as @xmath38 ( 5 ) tells us that the columns of @xmath39 are eigenvectors of @xmath14 - though not necessarily normalized - with the entries of @xmath36 as associated eigenvalues .",
    "@xmath14 is a square matrix with dimension the number of modes @xmath40 on the right side .",
    "@xmath6 as well as @xmath39 has @xmath40 lines and @xmath37 columns .",
    "single upper indices in ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) denote the dimension of a square matrix , double upper indices the line and column number of a rectangular matrix .",
    "every eigenvalue @xmath27 of @xmath12 is an eigenvalue of @xmath14 , too .",
    "however , we have not yet specified which number of modes , @xmath37 or @xmath40 , is the greater .",
    "for equal mode numbers @xmath41 we have just proven that the sets of eigenvalues of @xmath12 and @xmath14 are identical .",
    "now firstly suppose that @xmath42 .",
    "then ( 5 ) is a statement about @xmath37 out of the @xmath40 eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath14 , and gives no information about the other @xmath40-@xmath37 .",
    "secondly suppose that @xmath43 . as a preparation for the following argument",
    "we show that the scalar product of any two different columns of @xmath39 vanishes .",
    "elements of ( 4 ) multiplied by @xmath44 from the left give exactly those scalar products .",
    "@xmath44 is the matrix with the complex conjugates of the eigenvectors of @xmath12 as lines , or @xmath45 . @xmath15 as before refers to the entries of @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath46 @xmath39 has @xmath37 columns , each of which is an @xmath40-vector . in an @xmath40-dimensional vector space there",
    "can , however , only be @xmath40 non - vanishing mutually orthogonal vectors . to fulfill ( 6 )",
    "the remaining @xmath37-@xmath40 column vectors must be the zero vector . with more modes on the left than the right",
    "there are necessarily some modes or linear combinations of modes on the left that do not get transmitted through the junction at all .",
    "now in ( 6 ) choose @xmath47 and @xmath48 one of those column numbers for which @xmath49 is zero for all @xmath50 .",
    "then it follows that the corresponding @xmath51 , which is an eigenvalue of @xmath12 , is zero as well . for the single junction diagonalizing @xmath12 or @xmath14 will lead to the same ensemble of transport channels .",
    "for illustration an example with numbers is given in section 4 .",
    "regarding the first and last expression in the equation for @xmath52 , ( 6 ) also tells us that each @xmath51 represents the sum of some absolute values squared .",
    "therefore by its special contruction @xmath12 not only is a hermitian matrix with real eigenvalues , but all eigenvalues are even greater or equal to zero .",
    "this is essential because we shall identify the square roots of the @xmath27 as phaseless transmission amplitudes @xmath53 .",
    "properties of a series of two junctions will initially be given in terms of two scattering matrices , one between reservoirs l(left ) and i(island ) , and one between reservoirs i and r(right ) ( fig.3a ) .",
    "multiplying each scattering matrix by its adjoint and diagonalizing would give transport channel ensembles for each junction separately and represent the setup for incoherent coupling @xcite across the island .",
    "there are multiple reflections in each junction , but a charge transported to the island not to go back through that same junction relaxes there , that is changes the island s electrostatic potential , however , looses the information which ( eigen-)mode it had come into .",
    "diagonalizing matrices for each junction separately will not lead to the same linear combinations of island modes as eigenmodes for each side .",
    "setting up our formalism to determine transport channels with coherent coupling between two the junctions is not obvious , should just any of the three reservoirs l , i , r be chosen to demand that eigenmodes there associated to channels exclusively return to themselves if transmitted away from that reservoir and backscattered into it .",
    "nevertheless , as a scattering process starting on the island after two scattering steps offers no other possibility than to have brought the charge carrier back to the island , the above requirement _ for the island _ provides a promising ansatz .",
    "therefore given scattering matrices from i to l and from i to r , with by definition the same number of i - modes , are just joint together into one scattering matrix @xmath6 by taking all rows together .",
    "@xmath6 and @xmath54 are formally given with exemplary numbers of modes three on the left , four on the island and two on the right in fig.2 ( fig.3 are drawn for different numbers ) .",
    "now @xmath12 is diagonalized , again denoting eigenvalues as @xmath27 and eigenvectors as @xmath16 .",
    "the column vectors from @xmath16 build linear combinations of the original island modes .",
    "eigenvectors of @xmath14 , however , given by @xmath39 , now combine modes from both leads l and r. a @xmath55 associated to an eigenvector out of @xmath16 or the corresponding vector from @xmath39 gives us the transmission amplitude of a",
    " combined channel  between the island and the entire outside world consisting of both leads .",
    "if there have been @xmath56 original modes at l and @xmath57 at r , every column of @xmath58 is a normalized vector of length @xmath56+@xmath57 , whose first @xmath56 components represent coefficients for l - modes and whose last @xmath57 components are coefficients for r - modes . however , like for the single junction case , modes at l and r are independent . supplying a charge carrier in an original mode on the left , for example , makes the transmission eigenmodes it contributes to be populated with percentages the absolute values squared of their coefficients in the respective column from @xmath59 .",
    "therefore the transmission of an above mentioned combined channel splits up into the probability percentages left and right side modes contribute to the respective eigenmode . for assigning transmission amplitudes",
    "we take the roots of these parts to be multiplied by @xmath55 .",
    "so for the transmission amplitudes @xmath60 and @xmath61 for the left and right side channels of a pair of channels coherently linked together on the island ( =  combined channel  ) we obtain @xmath62 and @xmath63 this construction demonstrates that a series of point contacts enclosing a bulk - like island even with coherent coupling across the latter is _ not _ equivalent simply to a number of effective transport channels from left to right . paths from left to right rest a channel through the left junction connected to a channel through the right junction and these two parts can have different transmissions",
    ". however , we can not expect to describe coherently coupled junctions by the channel ensembles each one would exhibit as a single junction .",
    "furthermore , by construction there is no coherent cross coupling on the island between our newly found channels .",
    "one channel from the left can only be coherently coupled to one channel from the right and vice versa ( fig.3b ) .",
    "this finding elegantly solves the problem of generalizing a green s functions method for modelling current - voltage characteristics in the coherent case @xcite to several channels per junction .",
    "the algorithm to calculate changing rates for the island charge is only needed for a single channel per junction .",
    "contributions from all pairs of channels can then simply be added in classical rate equations .",
    "there may also be channels in a junction not coherently coupled to a partner channel in the other junction ( or pairs with transmission amplitude zero in one half ) .",
    "their island charging rates are even easier to calculate @xcite .",
    "we should only expect such unpaired channels , however , if in the original pattern there are modes coupled across one junction that are totally decoupled from all others involved in a network of couplings over both junctions , like l3 and i5 in fig.3a . i4 is not directly coupled to l , however indirectly via r3 and i3 as well as other paths , and will thus contribute to eigenmodes involving connections to both leads .",
    "like in the single junction case , there may be specific linear combinations of original modes at every one of the three sites that are not transmitted at all .    for a consistent description of the double junction with coherent coupling across the island",
    ", it has to be required that @xmath64 with the normalized vector @xmath18 representing any linear combination of original modes on the island and @xmath6 and @xmath54 now the big matrices from fig.2 .",
    "the prohibition of probability creation here also implies that all eigenvalues @xmath27 of @xmath12 have to be less than or at most one , even if the transmissions assigned to the channels in each junction further get multiplied with the parts by which a new combined island mode is transferred to each side .",
    "the new left and right modes at the ends of a pair of channels in fact constitute only parts of new combined - lead modes .",
    "the latter , however , form a unique set of eigenmodes .",
    "all these considerations about the double junction will be illustrated by number examples in the next section .",
    "we shall here present some further more marginal considerations on probability conservation or prohibiting probability creation . at the beginning of our analysis",
    "we regarded the system as described by an orthogonal set of modes on the left , an orthogonal set on the island and an orthogonal set on the right .",
    "of course , with the contact established overlaps exist between modes in a lead and modes on the island .",
    "these determine the transition amplitudes put into the original scattering matrix .",
    "the overlaps should , however , only go so far that parts of an island wave function that couple to left wave functions rest well separated from parts that couple to the right",
    ". then the sum of absolute squares of all scattering matrix elements out of an island mode will in no case exceed unity .",
    "the orthogonality of the modes in one lead ensures that the sum of absolute squares of all couplings to one certain island mode is limited by the norm one of that mode .",
    "taking just any overlaps that could have been set up as single junction scattering amplitudes does not automatically guarantee that the norm of any column vector of the big matrix @xmath6 , which contains scattering to the left _ and _ right modes , is less or equal to one .",
    "if the intersection of the overlaps of an island wave function with left wave functions and that with right wave functions is not empty , there would be a direct overlap between left and right wave functions , which will give rise to a direct transport channel from left to right .",
    "such a situation could be realizable , but our model does not cover that .",
    "nevertheless , suppose that two junctions in series have been investigated with incoherent coupling @xcite .",
    "in the incoherent model changes of the island charge and thus potential are felt by both contacts , but otherwise the latter are independent and behave like a single junction each . with incoherent coupling the regarded set of island modes need not even be the same concerning transport through the left or the right junction , but here suppose it is . to compare with the incoherent behaviour",
    ", one might want to estimate the system s properties if the same junctions get linked together coherently ( without allowing for direct left - to - right channels ) and therefore just put together two single - junction scattering matrices @xmath65 and @xmath66 into one like in fig.2a .",
    "where this should result in a column norm of @xmath6 exceeding unity , in this situation it makes sense to renormalize scattering amplitudes in the way that of the island mode the part overlapping with both left and right wave functions is scattered to either side with probabilities proportional to the ratio of absolute squares of the single - junction scattering amplitudes . in any case",
    "put - together scattering matrices @xmath6 should be checked for no column norm exceeding unity prior to solving for transport channels .",
    "let us illustrate that the simple criterion of norms of lines or columns being less or equal to 1 is not sufficient to ensure that a matrix is a scattering matrix . for simplicity",
    "an example with purely real numbers is given .",
    "for the single junction let @xmath54 be @xmath67 supposing two modes on the left and four on the right",
    ". then @xmath68 are all less than 1 . @xmath69 the eigenvalues of this matrix , namely the solutions of @xmath70 however , are @xmath71=0.148 and @xmath72=1.652 ( rounded to 3 digits ) , of which @xmath72 clearly is greater than 1 .",
    "( 3 ) is not fulfilled : @xmath73    let us now regard @xmath74 which is a scattering matrix , but otherwise its complex entries are randomly chosen . as @xmath6 is 3x2 , there are two original modes on the left and three on the right . @xmath75 and the eigenvalues of this 2x2 square matrix are @xmath71=0.1421 and @xmath72=0.2904 .",
    "@xmath76 is a 3x3 square matrix with eigenvalues @xmath71=0.1421 , @xmath72=0.2904 and @xmath77=0 ( a numerical calculation gives @xmath78 ) . to check ( 3 ) for both @xmath12 and @xmath14 we calculate @xmath79 by the way , the same value is obtained as @xmath80 with complex numbers even normalized eigenvectors",
    "are only determined up to a phase common to all components .",
    "the numerical routine we used to evaluate them gave them with real last component .",
    "for @xmath12 they are @xmath81 associated to @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively .",
    "eigenvectors of @xmath14 are @xmath82 associated to eigenvalues zero , @xmath71 and @xmath72 in that order . by multiplying ( 5 ) by @xmath83 from the left ,",
    "one deduces that the factor needed to normalize a column vector of @xmath39 , which we showed to be an eigenvector of @xmath14 , is @xmath84 with @xmath27 the corresponding eigenvalue .",
    "we shall now check explicitly the relation between the two sets of eigenvectors in our example , and especially verify that for unequal mode numbers left and right , the transformation in one direction produces some zero vector .",
    "@xmath85    @xmath86    @xmath87    @xmath88    @xmath89    @xmath90    @xmath87    the last is the zero vector within the accuracy taking into account no more than the written digits",
    ". it can not be normalized , of course , hence there is no factor @xmath84 in the last line .",
    "entries of scattering matrices are in general complex , but for simplicity we give examples with real numbers for the double junction , which is totally sufficient to show the important aspects of the calculation .",
    "to better keep track of which scattering amplitudes belong to the left and the right junction , @xmath6 is noted in table form like in fig.2 .",
    "our first example has four modes on the island , two in each lead and no vanishing scattering amplitudes .",
    "@xmath91    the sum of squares of all these 16 elements is 0.9921 , which is less than 1 and should thus ensure that all eigenvalues will be less than or at most 1 .",
    "the matrix to diagonalize is @xmath92    as eigenvalues and associated eigenvectors one finds    @xmath6 times the matrix made of these four column vectors returns a matrix consisting of the following four column vectors :    \\(25 ) gives the normalized eigenvectors of @xmath12 given in the basis of the original island modes , which is hinted at by the labels @xmath93 in front of their components .",
    "( 26 ) lists eigenvectors of @xmath14 and their components refer to the basis of lead modes .",
    "vectors in ( 26 ) are not yet normalized . to do so , divide by the square root of the @xmath27 above the respective column from ( 25 ) .",
    "to fully link the number examples to the notation of the previous sections , remark that the vectors in ( 25 ) give the columns of @xmath16 and those in ( 26 ) constitute @xmath39 .",
    "obviously the eigenchannel system consists of four pairs of channels , denoted as @xmath94 , @xmath95 . with the values from ( 26 ) we shall now work out the left and right contributions in each .",
    "for example , the transmission amplitude of the left channel in the first pair is given by the part of the l - modes in the normalized eigenvector multiplied by the square root of the respective @xmath27 , which is the transmission amplitude of the island eigenmode to the entire outside world , @xmath96 .",
    "the reason to give non - normalized vectors in ( 26 ) was that explicit factors @xmath55 drop out here .",
    "the following table lists all left and right transmission amplitudes as determined by ( 7 ) and ( 8) :    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     here again , the maximum possible input left amounts to two modes , and that right to one : @xmath97 channels are not at all the same as when letting the @xmath98-mode being transported fully coherently across the island .",
    "the important finding is , however , that , even if by construction some of the original island modes only have a direct overlap with one lead , the eigenchannel ensemble does not contain channels merely bridging a single junction ( if no paths are totally separated from the rest of the original network ) .",
    "the connection of the coherently and incoherently transported island modes via the lead modes causes the system to appear as effectively consisting of fully coherently linked channel pairs . as already pointed out earlier",
    ", the system of channel pairs does not suppress sequential transport .",
    "the latter may well be found to provide the dominating contributions in current - voltage characteristics .",
    "the channels with the largest throughput left and right may form a pair , in principle , however , as well belong to different pairs . can not be inferred from single @xmath53 alone .",
    "a renormalization is analytically possible in the normal conducting case , and a channel on the left , for example , would get @xmath99 @xcite . ]",
    "it has been discussed how to determine the ensemble of transport channels for a series of two point contacts enclosing an island between them , which allows coherent transport across it .",
    "we find that transport channels are only coherently coupled together in pairs involving one channel per junction .",
    "this makes a green s functions algorithm developed for single - channel junctions coherently coupled via an island @xcite applicable to the general case of multichannel junctions .",
    "the channel ensembles describing coherently coupled contacts will differ from those describing the same contacts each taken as a stand - alone device .",
    "partially coherent transport across the island can also be treated with the presented method of determining transport channels and will effectively look like coherent transport through more but less open channels .",
    "circuits with more than two contacts in series or with short - cutting channels between leads , however , would be more complicated to handle .",
