    "@xmath58 our model for the flux changes arising from the ellipsoidal distortion ( eq .",

    "if we were to solve for and remove the first two components ( thermal emission & reflected light ) , the residual light curve will contains the mass information ( fig .",
    "[ models ] - bottom ) . an important result of the model is that the ellipsoidal component contributes zero to the total light curve flux ( assuming e=0 ) at phase=0.5 ( centre of the secondary eclipse ) , and that the phase function depends only very slightly on the balance between the day- and night - side properties of any companion s emission ( i.e. it is extremely difficult to measure this with single passband optical data ) .",
    "thus the thermal emission and the reflected light components will be very difficult to distinguish in a single filter .",
    "nevertheless , one of the goals of modeling the full kepler light curve for koi-13 is to try to constrain the brightness temperature of koi-13.01 .",
    "the main different between our model and other algorithms ( such as beer - faigler & mazeh 2011 ) are that ( i ) we investigate two phase functions ( lambert and geometrical spheres - mislis et al .",
    "2011 ) and ( ii ) we include distinct reflected and thermal components ( including day & night side , @xmath59 , @xmath60 ) .",

    "2011 ) , assuming that it does not have its own internal source of heating ( as one would expect for a brown dwarf ) .",
    "the hottest known planet discovered to date is probably wasp-33b , with an equilibrium temperature of 2750k , and a brightness temperature of @xmath68k ( @xcite ) , measured from ground - based infrared ( @xmath69 ) observations of the secondary eclipse ( depth of 0.109 per cent ) .",
    "the relative thermal emission for wasp-33b in the optical ( kepler passband ) would be @xmath70 ( assuming a blackbody ) .",
    "we note that the secondary eclipse of koi-13.01 is @xmath71 ( szabo et al .",
    "2011 ) in the kepler passband .    as a starting point",
    ", we consider three simple scenarios for the phase light curve data alone , i.e. excluding all datapoints within the primary transit or the secondary eclipse . in case",
    "@xmath72 we assume that the bolometric albedo of the companion is fixed at @xmath73 , which means that the planet is perfectly reflective , that the thermal emission of the planet is zero , and therefore the model contains only reflected light and ellipsoidal variations . in case @xmath74 , we assume that the geometric albedo is zero @xmath75 , so the reflected light is zero and the model contains only thermal emission ellipsoidal variations , and doppler boosting ( @xmath76 is a function of @xmath77 and @xmath55 - eq . [ eq05 ] ) . finally , in case @xmath78 we consider a hybrid case , and allow @xmath79 and @xmath59 to be free parameters , i.e. both thermal emission and reflected light are present in the light curve in addition to any ellipsoidal variations .",
    "so in @xmath74 we fit for @xmath79 and @xmath80 , in @xmath72 we fit @xmath81 , @xmath60 ( energy circulation ) and @xmath80 , and in @xmath78 we fit all the parameters above . eccentricity ( @xmath82 ) and the periastron angle ( @xmath83 )",
    "are free parameters in all three scenarios .    as a final step , we add the primary transit and secondary eclipse data back into the light - curve , and re - assess @xmath78 ( and name it @xmath84 ) , primarily to see if the additional information on the depth of the secondary eclipse can provide useful constraints on the thermal emission form the planet ( as has been suggested by mazeh et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "an important and unresolved factor is how we treat the phase function of the reflected light .",
    "we consider two approaches : ( 1 ) modelling the planet as a lambert sphere ( russell 1916 ) , assuming that the intensity of the reflected light is @xmath85 at at phase @xmath86 ( as in the case of venus ) ; ( 2 ) an alternative choice would be to assume that the reflected light is @xmath87 at phase @xmath86 . in mislis et al .",
    "( 2011 ) we demonstrate that this choice leads to a significantly different phase - contribution for the reflected light , and therefore has a significant impact on the derived mass of the companion .",
    "the companion mass is significantly larger ( by 36 per cent ) if we use the lambert sphere compared to the geometrical sphere . in our analysis",
    "we are unable to distinguish between the two cases .",
    "thus , in the next section we present the results from the lambert sphere case , which gives the larger companion mass .",
    "with all three cases we find that the orbit is circular and that the eccentricity value is @xmath880.05 .",
    "all three scenarios require strong ellipsoidal variations to explain the phase light curve .",

[ models ] ( top ) shows the kepler light curve and the components for the @xmath78 scenario . in all three cases ,",
    "we agree on the mass of the unseen companion to within a few per cent , suggesting that the technique is largely independent of the precise nature ( be it thermal or reflected ) of the emission arising from the companion .",

    ", this is rather more complicated , because very small contributions from the ellipsoidal variations , and the marginally visible reflected light components are contributing to the total light of the system at this point in phase . and",
    "they need to be included in the modelling to constrain the night - side contribution to the system flux .",
    "mazeh et al .",
    "( 2011 ) have ignored these effects , and estimate the temperature of the companion to be 2600k .",

    "this then is our motivation for scenario @xmath95 introduced in the previous section .",
    "we added back into the light curve an additional 36 ( in eclipse ) data points , while adding no additional parameters to the model , i.e. the shape of the secondary eclipse is completely described by @xmath78 .",
    "a little surprisingly , the additional data do nothing to improve our constraints on the nature of the secondary as parameterized by @xmath79 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "perhaps this should not be so surprising , the depth of the secondary eclipse in a single filter is unlikely to tell us very much about the ratio of thermal to reflected emission from the planets atmosphere .",
    "infrared measurements could perhaps make a significant impact here , as they could be combined with the optical passband to shed light on the colour of the planet .",
    "we also note that our solution to the mass of koi-13.01 is not affected by the additional data points ( see figure  [ chi ] ) .",
    "the very small amplitude of the ellipsoidal variations @xmath96 for this period , can only be explained by a body of planetary mass .",
    "increasing the mass of the companion would significantly affect the amplitude of the ellipsoidal variations ( fig .",
    "[ models ] - bottom ) , therefore we are confident that the mass of the companion koi-13.01 is 8.3@xmath971.25 @xmath35 ( i.e a 1@xmath89 upper limit of 9.55@xmath35 ) , assuming that there are no other contributions to the kepler light curve that have so far been ignored in our analysis .",
    "it is worth noting that the ellipsoidal component of the light curve is visibly non - symmetric about phase 0.5 due to doppler beaming ( figure  [ models ] ) .",
    "the difference in heights is @xmath98 , i.e. 3 per cent of the total phase function signal ( assuming a simple model which neglects reddening ) .",
    "the mass we derive for the unseen companion to koi-13a , places the object below the minimum mass for deuterium burning ( spiegel et al .",
    ".    one possible source of error in our estimation of the companion s mass , is the uncertainty in the contribution of the companion a - star to the total kepler light curve .",
    "if we increase the contribution from the nearby stellar component , and the flux we attribute to koi-13a itself decreases , the mass of the planet becomes correspondingly larger , as the relative contribution of the ellipsoidal variations goes up .",
    "however , the effect is rather small when compared to our other sources of error .",
    "specifically , a factor of @xmath99 magnitudes , leads to a change in the mass of @xmath100 for the companion . if the howell et al .",
    "( 2011 ) delta - magnitude is used , then the mass of koi-13b will decrease by @xmath101 per cent ; this implies the body is even more planet - like .",
    "another possible source of error in our treatment of the system is our assumption that the companion behaves as a lambert sphere .",
    "if the correct phase function should be represented by a geometrical sphere , then the best - fit mass of the system will actually be significantly reduced by a systematic factor of 36 per cent , down to @xmath102 .",
    "see mislis et al .",

    "our analysis illustrates the wealth of information that can be extracted from high precision light curves , in the absence of spectroscopy .",
    "we find that the out - of - eclipse light curve of koi-13.01 is dominated by two effects .",
    "the light contributed by the planet is at the same amplitude as the ellipsoidal variations induced in the star .",
    "we are unable to solve for the relative contributions of thermal and reflected emission from the planet , however we expect the planet to be one of the hottest known , given its close proximity to an a - star , and its large radius .",
    "the equilibrium temperature for any zero - albedo companion to koi-13.01 is @xmath111k , which is rather hotter than calculated for wasp-33b and wasp-12b .",
    "we suggest that infrared observations would help to disentangle the thermal and reflected components of the light curve .    by modelling the light curve , we find that the mass of the planet is @xmath112 , robust against any assumptions about the albedo of the planet .",
    "we also find that the planet is orbiting in a circular orbit ( @xmath113 ) .",
    "our results suggest that the density of the planet is @xmath653 times larger than jupiter s density .",
    "this value is not surprising .",
    "there are much more dense exoplanets , such as xo-3b ( density @xmath656.5 times more dense than jupiter - exoplanet.org )    we have studied the case that the system is an m - dwarf or brown - dwarf eclipsing companion , but neither of these solutions can explain the light curve we observe .",
    "the expected radial velocity amplitude for koi-13 system is @xmath103 870 m s@xmath4 , which will be relatively easy to measure despite the nature of the primary ( a rapidly rotating a star ) and the contamination from the close a - star companion .",
    "it would be an interesting exercise to search all of the kepler light curves to look for the signature of ellipsoidal variations as a planet detection method , even in the absence of transits .",

    "<S> our analysis , based on the light curve alone , enables us to constrain the mass of the koi-13.01 companion to be @xmath1 and thus demonstrates that the transiting companion is a planet ( rather than a brown dwarf which was recently proposed by @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the high temperature of the host star ( spectral type a5 - 7v , @xmath2 k ) , combined with the proximity of its companion koi-13.01 , may make it one of the hottest exoplanets known , with a detectable thermal contribution to the light curve even in the kepler optical passband . </S>",
    "<S> however , the single passband of the kepler light curve does not enable us to unambiguously distinguish between the thermal and reflected components of the planetary emission . </S>",
