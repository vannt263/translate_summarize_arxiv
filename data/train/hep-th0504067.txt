    "recently it has been realized  @xcite that models of modified gravity which contain lorentz - violating graviton mass terms may avoid all known problems of massive gravity such as the van dam - veltman - zakharov ( vdvz ) discontinuity  @xcite , ghost instabilities  @xcite and strong quantum effects at the unacceptably low energy scale  @xcite . in the most general sense by massive gravity",
    "we understand any theory described by the following action @xmath0 where the first term is a usual einstein ",

    "a particularly interesting class of models found there is characterized by a residual reparametrization symmetry @xmath2 where @xmath3 are the spatial coordinates .",
    "this class of models is singled out by the following two properties .",
    "first , in the vicinity of the minkowski background these models represent consistent low - energy effective theories valid up to the energy scale @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is a graviton mass .",
    "the absence of ghosts and classical instabilities is ensured by the symmetry requirements alone without need for any extra fine - tuning .",
    "the second important property is that already the lowest - dimension operators ( graviton mass terms ) lead to the modification of gravity , in particular gravitational waves are massive .",
    "an example of a theory which shares the first but not the second property is the ghost condensate model  @xcite which , at the lowest derivative level , is equivalent to the gauge - fixed einstein theory .",

    "the phenomenological consequences of the massive gravity models obeying symmetry ( [ symmetry ] ) were first studied in ref .",
    "one of the unexpected properties found there is that massive gravitational waves may coexist with the long - range potential between the sources . in general",
    ", the gravitational potential in these models contains an extra `` confining '' piece which grows linearly with the distance from the source , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a combination of the graviton masses ( see sect .  [",

    "@xcite was focused mainly on the case @xmath8 when the additional dilatation symmetry ensures that the long - range potential is identical to that of the einstein theory .",
    "this relaxes the constraints coming from the solar system and cavendish - type experiments , and opens up a possibility for the graviton mass to be as large as @xmath9 without contradiction to the existing experimental data .",
    "the relic gravitational waves produced at inflation may constitute today the cold dark matter in the universe and would give a unique monochromatic signal in the gravitational wave detectors @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to study cosmological solutions in the massive gravity .",
    "we address the question of whether such solutions are phenomenologically acceptable , and what are their generic properties .",
    "we do not assume that parameters are tuned so that @xmath8 from the very beginning .",
    "it turns out , however , that for a large class of functions @xmath1 in eq .",
    "( [ fullaction ] ) the cosmological evolution naturally drives the system to the point @xmath8 where there are no corrections to the newtonian potential .",
    "in other words , this point is an attractor in the solution space ( it corresponds to the restoration of an additional dilatation symmetry ) . at this point",

    "this requirement reduces to two equations ( [ constraint1 ] ) and ( [ constraint2 ] ) , shown in the appendix a. consequently , this choice is possible for a generic function @xmath1 .    our current goal is to study linear perturbations about the vacuum ( [ vacuum ] ) .",

    "the instabilities of a different type , which we refer to as ultraviolet ( uv ) instabilities , are those which occur at wavelengths ( and/or timescales ) much shorter than that of the background curvature , approaching the scales of order @xmath164 .",
    "such instabilities do affect the structure of the theory in the ultraviolet and imply the breakdown of the effective field theory description for scales much lower than @xmath15 .",

    "we will see that the instabilities of this type are absent in our models .",
    "a physical reason is that massive gravities with symmetry ( [ symmetry ] ) can be thought of as stable scalar theories coupled to the einstein gravity , which is not possible the fierz  pauli case .",

    "is seen in the quadratic action about flat background at the one - derivative level .",
    "we believe that further analysis is needed to understand whether the two new modes lead to the problems like low strong coupling scale . note , however , that unlike in the fierz ",
    "pauli case , the new modes are not ghosts , provided the condition ( [ noghostcondition ] ) holds .",

    "the boulware - deser instability is absent .",
    "in order to be more than a theoretical exercise , the theory of lorentz - violating massive gravity must eventually address the fundamental puzzles of modern cosmology such as the origin of dark matter and dark energy .",
    "the class of models discussed in this paper provides a number of possibilities in this direction .    as follows from sect .",
    "[ cosmology ] , the evolution of the universe may naturally lead to the attractor which corresponds to the theory possessing the dilatation symmetry ( [ dilatation ] ) . in this case , the relations ( [ relation - for - masses ] ) among masses imply that the growing term in the newtonian potential vanishes . even in this simplest version ,",
    "the model has a number of features interesting from the cosmological and observational points of view .",
    "first , the massive graviton itself is a candidate for the dark matter particle @xcite .",
    "this possibility is observationally testable , the current limits being plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "the constraints will be improved in the near future by the data from the australian pulsar timing array  @xcite .",
    "if massive gravitons do not constitute all of the dark matter , they are still detectable in a certain range of masses because they would produce a unique monochromatic signal in a gravitational wave detectors such as lisa  @xcite .",
    "second , the goldstone fields give two extra contributions to the friedmann equation ( [ 00eq ] ) which we denoted @xmath99 and @xmath110 in sect .",
    "[ cosmology ] .",
    "for @xmath233 the first of these contributions @xmath99 behaves like a `` quintessence '' with the equation of state varying from @xmath106 to @xmath234 for different values of the parameter @xmath96 , which characterizes the dilatation symmetry emerging in the cosmological attractor ( see eq .",
    "( [ dilatation ] ) ) .",
    "the second contribution @xmath110 behaves as a cosmological constant .",
    "an interesting special situation takes place for @xmath147 . in this case both contributions @xmath99 and @xmath110 have vacuum equation of state @xmath235 . as a result",
    "the acceleration rate of the late de sitter phase is a dynamical quantity , determined by the initial conditions in the goldstone sector rather than by parameters of the action .",
    "this is similar to situation in the unimodular gravity @xcite , where cosmological constant is also a constant of integration .",
    "this similarity appears to be not just a coincidence .",
    "the metric determinant @xmath236 is invariant under the symmetry ( [ symmetry ] ) and under the dilatation symmetry ( [ dilatation ] ) with @xmath147 , so the symmetry group of massive gravity is a subgroup of the unimodular gravity in this case .",
    "on the other hand there is an important difference between massive gravity with @xmath147 and unimodular gravity .",
    "namely , the only difference between unimodular gravity and the einstein theory ( at least at the classical level ) is that in the former case solutions with arbitrary values of cosmological constant are present independently of the value of the vacuum energy . on the contrary , in massive gravity",
    "the contribution of the goldstone sector has the form of a cosmological constant only for flat homogeneous cosmological solutions .",
    "in particular , the initial conditions in the goldstone sector may vary in space resulting in solutions with different values of the acceleration rate in different parts of the universe .",
    "such solutions are absent in both general relativity and unimodular gravity . if nothing else , this allows the application of the anthropic arguments  @xcite .",
    "there is a caveat , however . in order to cancel a bare cosmological constant that is much larger than @xmath237 ( where @xmath15 is the cutoff scale of our model )",
    "one needs a fine - tuning to keep the mass of the graviton from being too large .",
    "it is not impossible to imagine an anthropic explanation for this fine - tuning as well  according to the estimates of ref .",
    "@xcite relic massive gravitons with masses higher than @xmath238 ( upper bound from the timing of the binary pulsars  @xcite ) are likely to overclose universe .",
    "alternatively , one may hope that the unusual properties of cosmological solutions in massive gravity may be a first step towards a dynamical solution of the dark energy problem .",
    "the situation may become more complicated if the model is kept away from the dilatation - symmetric attractor by a fine - tuning of the cosmological evolution or some other mechanism ( e.g. , if @xmath97 is proportional to some power of @xmath156 at late times , instead of being a constant ) .",
    "then the potential of a point - like source acquires  formally  the linearly growing contribution , eq .",
    "( [ confpotential ] ) .",
    "there are two distance scales associated with this contribution .",
    "the first one , @xmath239 , determines the distances where the growing term starts to dominate over the conventional one .",
    "the second scale is @xmath240 ; it depends on the mass @xmath64 of the source . at distance @xmath241",
    "the potential @xmath58 becomes of order unity indicating the breakdown of perturbation theory and possible onset of a non - linear regime .",
    "note that in the gauge we are using , the metric components that become large are @xmath242 where @xmath243 is a unit vector in the direction of the source .",
    "consequently , non - linear regime starts at the moment of time @xmath244 rather than at a certain distance from the source .    to understand this qualitatively ,",
    "recall that our choice of the integration constant @xmath74 corresponds to the initially homogeneous universe .",
    "one can view the goldstone sector as a ( multi - component ) fluid which is accreted by sources after they are formed .",
    "eventually , this accretion results in the onset of the non - linear regime ; qualitatively , this happens at the time of order @xmath241 after the formation of sources .",
    "it is tempting to speculate that this non - linear phase may result in the non - zero profile of the ghost condensate mode @xmath60 such that the linearly growing term in the potential ( [ phi ] ) is canceled .",
    "the corresponding non - linear dynamics is presumably similar to that of the ghost condensate model and is not sufficiently understood at the moment ( see @xcite for some proposals in this direction ) .",
    "one characteristic feature of the ghost condensate dynamics is the presence of strong retardation effects  @xcite , so one may think that the cancellation is incomplete , leading to the logarithmically growing potential needed to explain flat rotation curves .",
    "note that non - linear effects related to the ghost condensate mode are present even when linearly growing terms in the potential are forbidden by dilatation symmetries , so understanding of these effects is one of the most pressing questions for this kind of models .",
