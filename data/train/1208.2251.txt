    "the measurement at forward rapidity is made via the dimuon decay channel with two forward angle muon spectrometers , as detailed in ref .",
    "the muon spectrometers have acceptance over the range @xmath16 and over the full azimuth .",
    "the two spectrometers comprise an initial hadronic absorber followed by three sets of cathode strip chambers which are inside a magnetic field , referred to as the muon tracker ( mutr ) , and then five planes of iarocci tubes interleaved with steel absorber plates , referred to as the muon identifier ( muid ) .",
    "muon candidates are found by reconstructing tracks through the magnetic field in the mutr and matching them to muid tracks that penetrate through to the last muid plane .    in collisions at = 39 and",
    "62.4 gev , the events are selected with a minimum bias ( mb ) trigger utilizing the beam - beam counter ( bbc ) .",
    "the bbc comprises two arrays of 64 quartz erenkov counters covering pseudorapidity @xmath17 .",
    "the mb trigger requires at least two hits in each of the bbc arrays and a reconstructed collision @xmath18-vertex of @xmath19 cm , where @xmath20 is the center of the detector .",
    "the bbc total charge is used as a measure of the collision centrality ( the impact parameter of the collision is monotonically related to the average total charged particle multiplicity ) . following the procedure used for at = 200 gev , for each centrality selection the average number of nucleon participants ( @xmath21 ) and the average number of binary collisions ( @xmath22 )",
    "are estimated using a glauber model of the collision  @xcite and a negative binomial parametrization of the charged particles per pair of participating nucleons .",
    "the total fraction of the inelastic cross section measured by the mb trigger is determined to be @xmath23% and @xmath24% at 39 and 62.4 gev , respectively .",
    "the minimum bias sample is divided into exclusive centrality bins that are categorized via the glauber model comparison to the bbc charge distribution as given in table  [ tab : glauber ] .",

    "all unlike - sign muon candidates are paired to calculate the invariant mass distribution . underneath the signal are continuum background counts both from uncorrelated tracks and from correlated physical backgrounds such as open charm decay ( e.g. @xmath29 where both decay semi - leptonically to muons ) , open bottom decay , and the drell - yan process .",
    "first the uncorrelated background is calculated via an event mixing method with pairs from different events with the same centrality and @xmath18-vertex .",
    "this background is then normalized using a comparison of real - event and mixed - event like - sign pairs .",
    "after subtraction of the uncorrelated background , we fit to the remaining correlated dimuon spectrum with an acceptance - modulated line shape ( determined from a full  @xcite simulation of the phenix detector ) and an exponential folded with the acceptance to model the remaining correlated physics background . utilizing different assumptions about the line shape , different uncorrelated background normalizations , and",

    "the uncertainties listed in order are from uncertainties on the extracted yield as described above , the detector acceptance , the acceptance and efficiency over the rapidity range @xmath7 from the assumed pythia input distribution , the absolute check on the mutr and muid hit efficiencies , and the matching of dead areas in the real data and geant monte carlo ( mc ) simulation ."
