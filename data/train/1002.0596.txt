    "the excellent quality of the data generated by _ chandra _  for bright snrs in our galaxy is showcased by the false color images that have become perhaps the mission s most recognizable and widespread visual result ( figure 1 ) . for a snr with an angular diameter of @xmath3 like cas",
    "a , _ chandra _  can resolve more than @xmath4 individual regions .",
    "deep exposures of bright objects usually provide enough photon statistics to obtain a good spectrum from most of these regions at the moderate spectral resolution of the acis ccd detectors ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "this usually allows to detect k - shell emission from abundant elements like o , si , s , ar , ca , and fe .          the density of the plasma inside snrs is low enough for the ages of young objects like cas a or tycho to be smaller than the ionization equilibrium timescale .",
    "the x - ray emitting plasma heated by the shocks is therefore in a state of nonequilibrium ionization , or nei @xcite .",
    "this means that the ionization state of any given fluid element is determined not only by its electron temperature @xmath6 , but also by its ionization timescale @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the electron number density and @xmath9 is the time since shock passage .",
    "the thermal x - ray spectrum from a young snr is thus intimately related to its dynamic evolution through the individual densities and shock passage times of each fluid element .",
    "this has important implications for the ejecta emission , because of the large differences in chemical composition across the sn debris , and the fact that the electron pool is completely dominated by the contributions from high - z elements , making @xmath8 a strong function of the ionization state @xcite .    under these circumstances ,",
    "the quantitative analysis of x - ray spectra from young snrs becomes a challenging endeavor . in order to derive magnitudes that are relevant to sn physics , like the kinetic energy @xmath10 or the ejected mass of each chemical element",
    ", it is necessary to build a hydrodynamic model of the entire snr .",
    "one must know when each fluid element was shocked , what its chemical composition is , how much of the sn ejecta is still unshocked at the present time , etc .",
    "individual fitting of each magnitude becomes impractical , because they are all related to each other , and in order to understand the x - ray spectrum of a particular snr , one has to understand of the object as a whole .",
    "further complications stem from two sources .",
    "one is a technical , but important , problem : the uneven quality of atomic data in x - ray emission codes for nei plasmas @xcite .",
    "the other is of a more fundamental nature : the large uncertainties in the physics of collisionless shocks , in particular the amount of ion - electron temperature equilibration at the shock transition @xcite and the impact of cosmic ray acceleration on the dynamics of the plasma @xcite .",
    "most of the analysis of the x - ray emission from snrs is done following one of two radically different approaches .",
    "the first approach is to forgo the complex interaction between snr dynamics and x - ray spectrum , and fit the emission of the entire snr or individual regions using ready - made spectral models .",
    "the most widely used are plane - parallel shock nei models @xcite , which fit the spectra by varying @xmath6 , some parameter related to @xmath7 , and a set of chemical abundances .",
    "this has the advantages of simplicity and flexibility , but the number of free parameters is large , the quality of the fits is often poor , and the results are hard to interpret in the framework of sn physics and progenitor scenarios .",
    "the other approach is to model the full hd evolution of the snr _ ab initio _ , starting from a grid of sn explosion models and ism or csm configurations , calculate the nei processes in the shocked plasma , and produce a set of synthetic x - ray spectra that can then be compared to the observations .",
    "this approach is less flexible , and usually does not allow for spectral fits in the usual sense ( i.e. , based on the @xmath11 statistic ) , but it is considerably more powerful in that the observations and the physical scenarios that are being tested can be compared in a more direct way .",
    "the first hd+nei models for snrs were built to analyze the data from early x - ray missions like _ einstein _ and _ exosat _ ( e.g , @xcite ) .",
    "modern efforts produced for _ chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _  data can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "type ia sne are believed to be the thermonuclear explosion of a c+o wd that is destabilized when its mass becomes close to the chandrasekhar limit by accretion of material from a binary companion .",
    "after the central regions ignite , the burning front propagates outwards , consuming the entire star and leading to a characteristic ejecta structure , with @xmath12 of fe - peak nuclei ( mostly the @xmath13ni that powers the light curve ) in the inside and about an equal amount of intermediate mass elements ( mostly si , s , ar , and ca ) in the outside .",
    "the amount of @xmath13ni can be as high as @xmath14 in the brightest type ia sne , and as low as @xmath15 in the dimmest type ia sne , but the large scale stratification seems to be retained in all cases @xcite .",
    "state - of - the - art three - dimensional explosion models still can not reproduce these basic features in a self - consistent way , mostly because hydrodynamic instabilities tend to destroy the stratification of nucleosynthetic products on very short timescales @xcite .",
    "this relatively simple structure of type ia sn ejecta is responsible for the uniformity of the light curves and spectra that makes them useful as distance indicators for cosmology .",
    "the still poorly understood details of the multi - dimensional explosion mechanism might provide the diversity within the uniformity , leading to bright and dim events @xcite .",
    "the fact that bright ia sne appear to explode preferentially in star - forming galaxies @xcite suggests some connection between the properties of the progenitors and the explosion physics , but since the identity of the progenitors has never been clearly established , this connection remains mysterious @xcite .",
    "depending on the nature of the wd companion , sn ia progenitors are divided into single degenerate ( the companion is a normal star , @xcite ) and double degenerate ( the companion is another wd @xcite ) . finding clear evidence supporting one of these two scenarios has become a central problem in stellar astrophysics , because unknown evolutionary effects associated with the progenitors may introduce systematic trends that could limit the precision of cosmological measurements based on sn ia @xcite .",
    "most ( but not all ) type ia snrs reflect the relative uniformity and simplicity of their birth events .",
    "even a cursory glance at the _ chandra _  images of tycho ( figure 1 , @xcite ) or sn1006 @xcite reveals strikingly symmetrical objects , without large anisotropies in the ejecta emission , in marked contrast to the turbulent nature of cc snrs .",
    "the morphology and x - ray spectra of snrs with known ages and a well - established type ia classification also indicate that the progenitors do not modify their surroundings in a strong way - in particular , there is no evidence for large wind - blown cavities around the explosion sites @xcite .",
    "this is relevant because the current paradigm for type ia progenitors in the single degenerate channel predicts fast , optically thick outflows from the wd surface @xcite that would leave behind such cavities .",
    "we have to conlcude that either most type ia sne do not have single degenerate progenitors , or these fast outflows are not always present .",
    "in fact , the dynamical and spectral properties of young type ia snrs like tycho or 0509@xmath1667.5  are consistent with an interaction with the warm phase of the ism @xcite , and so is the detailed morphology of the blast wave in objects where it can be studied with sufficient resolution , like sn1006 @xcite    a notable exception to this is the kepler snr .",
    "although the recent deep ( 750 ks ) _ chandra _  exposure of kepler left little doubt that the snr is of type ia @xcite , its morphology shows a strong bilateral asymmetry ( figure 1 ) , and optical observations reveal clear signs of an interaction with a dense , n - enriched csm @xcite .",
    "this suggests that either the progenitor of kepler s sn or its binary companion might have been relatively massive , creating a bow - shock shaped csm structure as the system lost mass and moved against the surrounding ism @xcite .",
    "this complex csm interaction makes hd+nei modeling of the kepler snr challenging , and the estimation of the fundamental sn parameters difficult .",
    "most of the detailed models for kepler were published when the snr was widely believed to be of cc origin @xcite .",
    "it is important that these models be revised in light of the secure ia origin of the snr to determine the mass of @xmath13ni synthesized and the pre - explosion mass - loss rate from the progenitor .",
    "obtained by matching the angular sizes of the reverse shock ( rs , dashed plots ) and contact discontinuity ( cd , solid plots ) to a bright ia sn model ( ddta , blue plots ) , and a dim ia sn model ( ddtg , red plots ) .",
    "the values of @xmath17 in the hd+nei models of @xcite that provide the best match to the x - ray emission from the sn ejecta are indicated by the striped vertical band .",
    "the value of @xmath17 required by the cr - modified shock models of @xcite is indicated by a vertical dash - dotted line .",
    "the estimated value of the distance @xmath18 from @xcite is indicated by the horizontal solid line , with the dotted horizontal lines marking the upper and lower limits . ]",
    "the hd+nei modeling approach has had more success in objects with simpler dynamics , like the tycho snr .",
    "one - dimensional hd+nei models with a uniform ambient medium can reproduce the fundamental features of both the dynamics and the integrated x - ray spectrum of tycho , provided that the ejecta is stratified , with an fe content similar to what would be expected from a sn ia of normal brightness , and the ambient medium density is @xmath19 ( @xcite , figures 2 and 3 ) .",
    "this density estimate merits a few comments .",
    "although it is clear that cosmic ray acceleration has a strong impact on the dynamics of the forward shock @xcite , the fact remains that the microphysics of the process is not well understood , and cosmic ray backreaction is usually not included in full hd+nei models for the ejecta emission in snrs ( see @xcite ) .",
    "instead , the assumption is made that the dynamics of the shocked ejecta are not severely affected by cosmic ray acceleration at the blast wave , which seems reasonable in light of the properties of the reverse shock ( see discussion in section 3 of @xcite ) . in any case",
    ", it is important to emphasize that the value of @xmath17 required by the ejecta emission in the tycho snr also reproduces the angular sizes of the reverse shock and contact discontinuity at the correct distance to the snr ( figure 2 ) .",
    "this basic validation of the underlying dynamic model is essential to the hd+nei approach , and strengthens the confidence on the conclusions drawn about the sn explosion .     of @xmath13ni ,",
    "interacting with an am of @xmath20 .",
    "the contribution of the nonthermal emission from the blast wave is indicated by the dotted plot , the rest is thermal emission from the shocked ejecta ( figure from @xcite ) . ]",
    "the stratification of the ejecta in the tycho snr is required by the fact that the @xmath7 of fe in the x - ray spectrum is lower than that of si , which can be explained naturally if most of the si is shocked earlier and at a higher density than most of the fe ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this argument is completely independent from the constraints on the ejecta structure obtained with optical spectroscopy of type ia sne , and constitutes a clear sign that a supersonic burning front ( i.e. , a detonation ) must have been involved in the physics of the explosion at some stage .",
    "the most succesful sn model found by @xcite is a one - dimensional delayed detonation with @xmath21 erg that synthesizes @xmath22 of @xmath13ni ( figure 3 ) - in other words , a type ia sn of normal brightness , consistent with the historical records @xcite .    67.5 :",
    "the le is well matched only by spectra of bright type ia sne like sn 1998es , sn 1999aa , and sn 1999dq ( figure from @xcite ) . ]",
    "one largely unexpected , but very important , development in this field has been the possibility to calibrate the results obtained from the analysis of the ejecta emission in snrs using the light echoes from ancient sne .",
    "these light echoes were originally discovered in the lmc @xcite , and they are important for two reasons . first , they can provide a reliable and independent age estimate for objects that previously had none , which is a crucial ingredient to build hd models ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "second , and most important , the spectroscopy of the light echoes can be used to determine the type ( cc vs. ia ) and subtype ( e.g. , bright ia or dim ia ) of ancient sne .",
    "this technique was demonstrated by @xcite , who showed that snr 0509@xmath1667.5  in the lmc was originated by a bright , @xmath13ni - rich type ia sn . at the same time",
    ", @xcite revisited the archival observations of this snr and found that an hd+nei model based on a bright sn ia explosion reproduces both the x - ray emission from the shocked ejecta and the dynamics of the snr ( see figures 4 and 5 ) .",
    "this agreement between two completely independent techniques applied to the same object has now been extended to historical sne in our own galaxy , with the discovery of light echoes from tycho and cas a @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic analysis of the light echo from tycho @xcite confirmed that sn1572 was indeed a type ia sn of normal brightness , a spectacular validation of the previous result obtained with hd+nei models of the snr @xcite .    67.5 : the x - ray spectrum of the snr can only be reproduced with a bright type ia sn models that synthesizes @xmath23 of @xmath13ni ( figure adapted from @xcite ) . ]    the emergence of the x - ray observations of snrs as well - established probes for type ia sne has important implications for sn research .",
    "because snrs are nearby objects , the context of the exploded star can be studied in great detail , and relationships between specific explosion properties and progenitor scenarios can be tested _ in situ_. one powerful constraint on the single degenerate scenario for sn ia progenitors , for example , is the presence of the donor star , which should survive the explosion @xcite .",
    "so far , the search for this star in the tycho snr has produced inconclusive results @xcite , but further work in this and other snrs should eventually clarify the identity of the progenitor of at least one sn ia explosion with known properties .",
    "another recently opened line of research is the possibility to measure the metallicity of sn ia progenitors _ directly _ , using mn and cr lines in the x - ray spectrum of their snrs .",
    "this technique yields a supersolar metallicity for the progenitor of tycho @xcite , a measurement that will soon be extended to other objects like kepler .",
    "even a small census of metallicities obtained in this way will allow us to validate the correlations between the metallicity of the host galaxy and the sn ia brightness found in sn surveys @xcite . finally , the snr population in the magellanic clouds has great potential to constrain type ia sn progenitor models , because the resolved stellar population in these nearby galaxies can be studied in great detail .",
    "snr 0509@xmath1667.5 , for instance , which was originated by a bright type ia sn , is embedded in a relatively old , metal - poor stellar population , while snr n103b , which has signs of a csm interaction similar to kepler @xcite , is associated with a much younger , metal - rich population @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the progenitor of snr n103b might have been relatively young and massive , and might have modified its surroundings through some kind of mass - loss process .",
    "cc sne mark the final events in the lives of massive ( @xmath24 ) stars . after nuclear fuel",
    "is exhausted in the inner regions , the stellar core collapses to form a neutron star or a black hole .",
    "the layers of the star that do not end up in the central compact object bounce and start propagating outwards , but at present it is unclear exactly how the gravitational collapse of the core becomes an explosion @xcite . at the writing of this review , the most sophisticated multi - d simulations of cc sne still fail to explode . although the identity of the progenitors of cc sne is well - established , with several identifications in pre - explosion images @xcite , the details of which specific kinds of massive stars lead to which specific subtypes of cc sne ( e.g. type ib / c , type iil , etc . )",
    "are still under debate .",
    "most of these uncertainties stem from our imperfect knowledge of key processes in stellar evolution , like mass - loss mechanisms or the role played by binarity .",
    "just like type ia snrs , the basic morphology of cc snrs reflects the fundamental characteristics of their birth events .",
    "_  images of young cc snrs like cas a @xcite or snr g292.0@xmath251.8 @xcite reveal a complex and turbulent structure , with marked asymmetries related both to the sn ejecta and the csm .",
    "in contrast to type ia snrs , many cc snrs show prominent optical emission from radiatively cooled ejecta , the hallmark of an interaction with a relatively dense medium .",
    "the poster child for young , ejecta - dominated cc snrs is cas a , an object that has played a central role in the history of _ chandra_. the first scientific result from the mission was the discovery of the central compact object @xcite , now thought to be a neutron star with a c atmosphere @xcite . the first refereed publication based on _ chandra _  data was also devoted to cas a @xcite .",
    "this paper discusses the overturn of nucleosynthetic products in a large region in the se of the snr , where fe - rich material can be seen clearly ahead of si - rich material , indicating that some of the layers deep into the onion - skin structure of the exploding star have overtaken regions dominated by lower - z elements ( figure 1 , however , see @xcite for an alternative interpretation ) . over the years , more and more has been learned about the cas a sn and its progenitor . in 2003",
    ", @xcite used the positions of the fluid discontinuities , the presence of high - velocity h , and the extent of the clumpy photoionized pre - sn wind to infer that the cas a explosion must have been of type iin or iib sn .",
    "this ` prediction of the past ' , similar to the one made for the tycho snr , was also confirmed by the light echo , which has a spectrum very similar to that of the type iib sn1993j @xcite .",
    "the morphology of the ejecta emission from cas a is very rich ( @xcite , figures 1 and 6 ) , but perhaps the most striking feature in the x - ray images is the jet / counterjet structure that runs from the sw to the ne @xcite . in order to understand the energetics of this feature and the role that it played in the explosion",
    ", @xcite used hd+nei simulations to interpret the fits to small x - ray bright knots in the sn ejecta ( see figure 7 ) .",
    "while it is clear that there was a significant local deposition of energy around the jet region @xcite , this was probably not enought to drive the entire explosion @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it turns out that the proper motion of the compact object is not aligned with the jet axis , as one would expect in a jet - driven explosion , but perpendicular to it , along a mysterious gap in the high - velocity ejecta revealed by _",
    "hst _ images of optical knots @xcite .",
    "the expansion of these knots is consistent with an explosion date close to 1680 @xcite , but the sn was not nearly as bright as other historical events like tycho or kepler . given the reddening towards the line of sight of the snr , this suggests a low ejected mass of @xmath13ni , @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "cas a is also one of the few cc snrs that is young enough to detect the decay products of @xmath27ti and infer an ejected mass for this isotope ( @xmath28 , @xcite ) .",
    "and @xmath7 values in small x - ray knots to hd+nei models .",
    "the lines represent models appropriate for cas a , with @xmath29 , @xmath30 erg and different power - law indexes .",
    "figure from @xcite . ]",
    "several authors have used this wealth of observational information to build detailed models for the progenitor of the cas a sn . according to @xcite ,",
    "all the observational constraints from the snr can be matched by a progenitor scenario where a 15 - 25 @xmath31 star loses its h envelope to a binary interaction and undergoes an energetic explosion in a ` stripped ' state .",
    "this view has been challenged by later works , who favor a slightly more massive progenitor @xcite .",
    "a particularly controversial issue is whether the progenitor went through a wolf - rayet phase before exploding , excavating a small cavity inside the dense @xmath32 csm that is being overrun by the blast wave today @xcite .",
    "this brief ( and incomplete ) summary of what we have learned about the cas a sn from its snr exemplifies the great value of deep observations of nearby snrs .",
    "although the explosion itself was never observed with the conventional tools used to study distant sne , the birth event of the cas a snr might be the best - studied demise of a massive star after that of sn 1987a .",
    "this brief review on the x - ray observations of snrs has been written with two main goals .",
    "the first is to illustrate the power of snr studies as probes of the sn phenomenon .",
    "the unique capabilities of modern x - ray satellites like _ chandra _  offer a radically different view of the explosions and their progenitors , a vision that is independent of , and complementary to , the conventional studies of extragalactic sne at optical wavelengths .",
    "the x - ray data sets assembled for well - known objects like tycho or cas a will be a lasting legacy of the _ chandra _  mission , and they represent the most detailed picture of the structure of sn ejecta currently available at any wavelength . the recent discovery that the statistical properties of the ejecta emission resolved by _ chandra _  can be used to distinguish cc from type ia snrs @xcite is a powerful example of the potential of these data .",
    "it is therefore crucial that the campaign of x - ray observations of snrs with _",
    "chandra _  and other satellites continue , and that deep exposures be completed for all the objects that do not have them .",
    "the discovery of new young snrs , while difficult , is definitely possible , as illustrated by the @xmath33 yr old galactic snr g1.9@xmath250.3 @xcite , and should be pursued in parallel to the study of well - known ones .",
    "the second goal of this review is to emphasize the importance of careful modeling for the analysis of the x - ray spectra of snrs .",
    "because of the nei character of the shocked plasma in snrs , it is extremely difficult to interpret their x - ray spectra in terms of magnitudes that can be used effectively to constrain explosion physics and progenitor scenarios . a robust , quantitative analysis usually requires putting together a dynamical model for the snr - in other words , the x - ray emission of a snr can not be interpreted without understanding the object as a whole , at least to some degree . in this context ,",
    "one - dimensional hd+nei models have been successful in recovering the fundamental properties of sn explosions from the spatially integrated x - ray spectra of type ia snrs , and validation of the technique through the spectroscopy of sn light echoes has been possible in a few cases .    these results are certainly encouraging , but much remains to be done before the full potential of the x - ray observations of snrs is realized . in order to take advantage of the spatially resolved spectroscopy capabilities of _ chandra",
    "_ , it is necessary to build multi - dimensional hd+nei snr models .",
    "this line of research has great promise as a benchmark for multi - dimensional sn explosion models , which hold the key to fundamental processes like the physical mechanism responsible for cc sne @xcite or the origin of the diversity within type ia sne @xcite .",
    "present and future x - ray observations of snrs present many opportunities for sn research .",
    "these opportunities are not devoid of challenges , but the excellent quality of the data obtained with _ chandra _  and other satellites fully warrant the effort required to meet them .",
    "because of the unique view of the sn phenomenon that they offer , snrs should play a central role in shaping our understanding of sn explosions .",
    "i want to thank kimberly arcand and peter edmonds for assistance with the _ chandra _  images .",
    "i also want to express my gratitude to all the mebers of the sn and snr community with whom i have shared the excitement about the results of _ chandra _  and other x - ray satellites .",
