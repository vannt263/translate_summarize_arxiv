    "since most stars are formed in clusters , it would be useful to have quantitative and objective statistical measures of their structure , with a view to comparing clusters formed in different environments , and tracking changes in structure as clusters evolve .",
    "this is particularly important for young , embedded clusters , where the structure may yield important clues to the formation process but is changing rapidly .",
    "it is also important for comparing observed clusters with numerical simulations .    at present",
    ", we do not have sufficiently robust statistical measures for this purpose .",
    "features which are easily identified by the human eye , such as sub - clusters , or linear features , can be strangely elusive to objective statistical analysis .",
    "for example , it is difficult to distinguish , statistically , between a degree of fractal or random sub - clustering , and the existence of a density gradient ( bate , clarke & mccaughrean 1997 ) .",
    "this paper explores some possible measures , and evaluates their usefulness .",
    "in particular , we find a robust objective measure which both quantifies , and distinguishes between , a smooth large - scale radial density gradient and multi - scale ( fractal ) sub - clustering .    in section 2",
    "we describe our methodology . in section 3",
    "we look again at the mean surface density of companions ( msdc ) , a tool pioneered by larson ( 1995 ) and subsequently used by several others ( e.g. simon 1995 ; bate , clarke and mccaughrean 1997 ; nakajima et al .",
    "1998 ; brandner & khler 1998 ; gladwin et al . 1999 ; klessen & kroupa 2001 ) .",
    "we focus on measures which reflect the clustering regime ( wide separations ) rather than the binary regime ( close separations ) . in section 4 we explore the use of the minimal spanning tree ( barrow , bhavasar & sonoda 1985 ) and its derivatives . in section 5",
    "we combine the msdc and the mst to derive a single measure @xmath0 which is able both to quantify , and to distinguish between , a smooth radial density gradient and multi - scale ( fractal ) sub - clustering .",
    "all the measures are tested and calibrated on multiple realizations of artificial star clusters , and applied to @xmath14 ophiuchus , chamaeleon , taurus , ic348 and ic2391 .",
    "our results are discussed in section 6 , and the main conclusions are summarized in section 7 .",
    "three different types of artificial star cluster have been created , using random numbers @xmath27 to generate the individual star positions . the first type ( 2d@xmath4 )",
    "are circular clusters ( i.e. two - dimensional disc - like clusters ) with surface density @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the second type ( 3d@xmath4 ) are spherical clusters ( i.e. three - dimensional clusters ) having volume density @xmath3 with @xmath30 .",
    "the third type ( f@xmath7 ) are fractal star clusters ( again three dimensional ) with fractal dimension @xmath31 .",
    "the different types are listed in column 1 of table  [ measures ] .",

    "this process is repeated recursively until there is a sufficiently large generation that , even after pruning to impose a spherically symmetric envelope of radius 1 within the ur - cube , there are still more children than the required number of stars .",
    "children are then culled randomly until the required number is left , and the surviving children are identified with the stars of the cluster . at each generation , the survival of a child is determined by generating a random number @xmath27 in @xmath88 ; survival then requires that @xmath89 .",
    "clusters of type 2d@xmath4 are investigated for two purposes .",
    "first , we wish to clarify the effect of a sharply defined circular edge on an otherwise statistically uniform , two - dimensional distribution of stars .",
    "clusters of type 2d0 enable us to isolate this effect .",
    "second , we wish to explore how readily two - dimensional and three - dimensional distributions can be distinguished",
    ". this could be important if stars are being formed in layers , for example at a shock front .    for each type of artificial cluster ,",
    "100 realisations are analysed , so that means and standard deviations can be obtained for the parameters extracted .",
    "three - dimensional clusters ( types 3d@xmath4 and f@xmath7 ) are projected onto an arbitrary plane prior to analysis .",
    "two - dimensional clusters are viewed face - on .",
    "a widely used tool for analysing the structure of star clusters is the log / log plot of the mean surface - density of companions , @xmath90 against separation , @xmath91 .",
    "this tool has been pioneered by larson ( 1995 ) , building on earlier work by gomez et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , who used the two point correlation function .",
    "several papers have confirmed larson s finding that a plot of @xmath92 $ ] against @xmath93 $ ]  hereafter a larson plot  can be fitted with two power law sections , corresponding to two distinct regimes . at the smaller separations , @xmath94 ,",
    "a star s companions are mainly in binary and higher multiple systems , and the slope of the larson plot is @xmath95/d\\ell og[s ] \\simeq -2 $ ] . at larger separations , @xmath96 , companions are simply other members of the overall cluster , and may only be close due to projection .",
    "the slope here is generally larger ( i.e. still negative but smaller in magnitude ) , @xmath97/d\\ell og[s ] \\ga -1 $ ] .",
    "larson has suggested that @xmath98 might be related to the fractal dimension of the sub - clustering , @xmath99 .",
    "in addition , he has proposed that the break point between the two straight sections , at @xmath100 , might correspond to the jeans length .",
    "however , recent analysis has cast some doubt on these interpretations .",
    "first , the break point is strongly influenced by the overall surface - density of stars ( and hence by the depth of the cluster along the line of sight ) , as pointed out by simon ( 1997 ) and bate et al ( 1997 ) .",
    "second , fitting @xmath101 objectively is difficult , because at the low-@xmath91 end it is distorted by the switch to the binary regime , and  more importantly  at the high-@xmath91 end it is distorted by edge effects .",
    "consequently , one is left with at best a range of order @xmath102 to @xmath103 and the result is sensitive to how the range is actually chosen ; if the range is shortened or extended arbitrarily , the slope of the fitted line may change dramatically .",
    "third , @xmath98 is not necessarily related to the fractal dimension of the clustering . as shown by bate et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and klessen & kroupa ( 2001 ) , it may simply reflect a large - scale density gradient in the cluster .",
    "an alternative way of evaluating the data from which larson plots are derived is to calculate the distribution function @xmath1 , where @xmath104 gives the probability that the projected separation between two cluster stars chosen at random is in the interval @xmath105 . to do this empirically ,",
    "we define @xmath106 equal @xmath91-bins in the range @xmath107 , so that all the bins have width @xmath108 , and the @xmath109th bin corresponds to the interval @xmath110 , with mean value @xmath111 .",
    "@xmath112 is the overall radius of the cluster , and is defined by finding the mean position of all the stars in the cluster and then setting @xmath112 equal to the distance to the furthest star .",
    "then we count the number of separations @xmath113 falling in each bin , and put @xmath114 where @xmath11 is the total number of stars in the cluster , and hence @xmath115 is the total number of separations .",
    "figure  [ arti / p(s)](a ) presents the results obtained from 100 clusters of type 2d0 , i.e. a disc having statistically uniform surface - density .",
    "the plotted points give the mean @xmath116 from the 100 realizations , and the error bars give the width of the bin and the @xmath117 standard deviation . if there were no edge effects ( i.e. if the uniform surface - density extended to infinity in two dimensions ) , we would have @xmath118 , and this is indeed a good fit to @xmath116 at small @xmath119 values , as indicated by the dashed line on fig .  [ arti / p(s)](a ) .",
    "_ departures from this straight line are entirely due to edge effects . _    in fact , @xmath120 can be calculated semi - analytically for a disc having uniform surface - density : @xmath121 where @xmath122\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the solid line on fig .",
    "[ arti / p(s)](a ) shows that this function fits the plotted points well , and it is included on all the other plots for reference , i.e. to emphasize the features which are not due to edge effects .",
    "when derived in this way , the @xmath120 plot contains little information about the distribution of binary separations , since they are all in the first bin .",
    "however , it seems to be well established that the distribution of binary separations is approximately scale free over a wide range of separations ( @xmath123 ) .",
    "the more critical issue  the one with which we are concerned here  is the distribution of separations in the clustering regime and what it tells us about the overall structure of the cluster .",
    "this information is well represented by @xmath120 , as can be seen from figs .",
    "[ arti / p(s)](b ) through  [ arti / p(s)](f ) , which show the results obtained for the other five types of non - fractal artificial star cluster .",
    "figure  [ arti / p(s)](b ) shows how @xmath120 is slewed towards smaller @xmath91 values for a disc with a centrally concentrated surface - density , @xmath124 .",
    "figures  [ arti / p(s)](c ) to  [ arti / p(s)](f ) show spherical clusters having volume - density gradients @xmath3 with @xmath125 . again",
    "the distribution slews to smaller @xmath91 values as the sphere becomes more centrally concentrated ( i.e. with increasing @xmath4 ) .",
    "one feature which distinguishes the plots is the location of the maximum , i.e. the separation @xmath126 at which @xmath120 is largest . as",
    "a cluster becomes more centrally condensed , @xmath126 moves to smaller values , and the amplitude of the maximum increases .",
    "however , for an individual cluster @xmath126 will not be well defined , and so it is not a robust measure .",
    "a better measure of this trend is the normalized correlation length for each cluster .",
    "the correlation length is the mean separation @xmath2 between stars in the cluster , and it is normalized by dividing by @xmath112 .",
    "the second column of table  [ measures ] gives mean values of @xmath2 and their standard deviations , for the various artificial cluster types .",
    "the @xmath2 values for the five real star clusters are also given .",
    "the shapes of the @xmath1 plots , and hence also the @xmath2 values , are independent of the number of stars in the cluster . in trials with cluster sizes of 100 to 1000 stars ,",
    "@xmath2 stays within one standard deviation of the mean value for 200 stars .",
    "this is at first sight surprising .",
    "a 1000-star cluster is so much more dense than a 100-star cluster , that one might expect the mean separation of stars to be smaller .",
    "however , although each star has more close neighbours , it also has more distant neighbours , and the value of @xmath2 remains constant .",
    "this is an attractive feature of the normalised correlation length as a statistical descriptor for clusters . from table 1 , we see that @xmath2 decreases monotonically with increasing @xmath4 , and can therefore be used to estimate @xmath4 for star clusters which are presumed _ a priori _ to have radial density gradients .",
    "importantly , cluster types 2d1 and 3d2 are easily distinguished by their @xmath2 values and their @xmath120 plots , despite the widespread but fallacious assumption that a three dimensional cluster with volume - density @xmath127 is , when projected on the sky , similar to a two dimensional cluster with surface - density @xmath124 .",
    "in fact it is clusters of types 2d1 and 3d1 ( i.e. with the same exponent , @xmath128/d \\ell n[r ]   \\sim -1 $ ] , and @xmath129/d \\ell n[r ] \\sim -1 $ ] ) which are hard to distinguish .",
    "@xmath1 plots for the real clusters are shown on fig .",
    "[ real / p(s ) ] .",
    "ic348 and @xmath14 ophiuchus resemble clusters of type 3d2 , both on the basis of their @xmath2 values ( table 1 ) , and the shapes of their @xmath1 plots ( figs .",
    "[ real / p(s)](a ) and  [ real / p(s)](c ) ) .",
    "for ic2391 the @xmath2 value and the @xmath1 plot ( fig .",
    "[ real / p(s)](b ) ) are most like those for clusters of type 3d1 .",
    "chamaeleon and taurus have correlation lengths intermediate between types 3d1 and 3d2 , but their @xmath1 plots are clearly not generic .",
    "this is because they contain sub - clusters , as illustrated in figs .",
    "[ realfield](d ) and  [ realfield](e ) .",
    "consequently @xmath1 has multiple maxima . in some cases",
    "these maxima can be identified with ( i ) separations between stars in the same sub - cluster ( the maximum at the smallest separations ) and ( ii ) separations between stars in two distinct sub - clusters ( maxima at larger separations , corresponding to the separation between the two sub - clusters ) .",
    "if there are @xmath130 sub - clusters , there can be up to @xmath131 maxima , but fewer if there is degeneracy in the distances between sub - clusters . after smoothing , the @xmath1 plot for chamaeleon ( fig .",
    "[ real / p(s)](e ) ) shows two distinct maxima , suggesting at least two sub - clusters , and fig .",
    "[ realfield](e ) does indeed show two sub - clusters .",
    "they are separated by @xmath132 , hence giving rise to the maximum in @xmath1 at @xmath133 . however , after smoothing , the @xmath1 plot for taurus ( fig .",
    "[ real / p(s)](d ) ) shows only three well defined maxima , suggesting at most three sub - clusters , whereas fig .  [ realfield](d ) shows at least eight well defined sub - clusters .",
    "evidently the @xmath1 plot is not a robust diagnostic of sub - clustering .    if we now consider artificial fractal star clusters with the same fractal dimension d , we find that there is so much variance in their individual @xmath120 plots that we can not sensibly define a mean @xmath120 plot",
    ". however , we can still compute the mean normalised correlation length @xmath2 and its variance .",
    "the results are given in table 1 .",
    "we see that @xmath2 increases monotonically with increasing d and can therefore be used to estimate d for star clusters which are presumed _ a priori _ to be fractal .",
    "moreover , the value of @xmath2 for star clusters of type f3.0 is essentially the same as for clusters of type 3d0 , as it should be .",
    "the small difference is attributable to the fact that in constructing clusters of type f3.0 the positioning of the individual stars is not completely random , whereas for type 3d0 it is .",
    "however , the range of @xmath2 for d in ( 1.5,3.0 ) is almost identical to that for @xmath4 in ( 0,2 ) .",
    "therefore @xmath2 is degenerate and can not on its own be used to distinguish multi - scale ( fractal ) sub - clustering from a large - scale radial density gradient .",
    "the minimal spanning tree ( mst ) is the unique network of straight lines joining a set of points , such that the total length of all the lines  hereafter ` edges '  in the network",
    "is minimised and there are no closed loops .",
    "the construction of such a tree is described by gower and ross ( 1969 ) .",
    "starting at any point , an edge is created joining that point to its nearest neighbour .",
    "the tree is then extended by always constructing the shortest link between one of its nodes and an unconnected point , until all the points have been connected .",
    "figure  [ mstreal ] shows the msts for the real star clusters @xmath14 ophiuchus , taurus , chamaeleon , ic348 and ic2391 .",
    "the use of minimal spanning trees ( msts ) as a probe of cosmological structure was explored by barrow , bhavsar and sonoda ( 1985 ) , and a further refinement , the self avoiding random walk , was described by baugh ( 1993 ) . although the approach seemed promising as a means of picking out clumps and filaments , the only statistical analysis of the mst for cosmological purposes of which we are aware is due to graham , clowes and campusano ( 1995 ) , who adopted methods developed by hoffman and jain ( 1983 ) and dussert et al(1987 ) and applied them to the distribution of quasars .",
    "we describe their analysis in appendix  [ graham ] , and show that it does not work well for star clusters .",
    "once the mst of a cluster has been constructed it is straightforward to compute the mean edge length , @xmath8 . unlike the normalised correlation length @xmath2 , @xmath8 is not independent of the number of stars in the cluster , @xmath11 .",
    "as @xmath11 increases , more short edges are created on the mst and @xmath8 decreases .",
    "the expected total length of the mst of a random array of @xmath11 points , uniformly distributed over a two - dimensional area a , is asymptotically proportional to @xmath134 ( hammersley et al .",
    "as there are @xmath135 edges , the mean edge length is asymptotically proportional to @xmath136 , and so this factor should be used to normalise the mean edge length of clusters having different areas @xmath10 and/or different numbers of stars @xmath11 .",
    "the resulting normalised mean edge length @xmath8 has been evaluated for 100 realisations of each type of artificial star clusters , and for the real star clusters , and the results are recorded in table 1 ( column 3 ) .",
    "also recorded in table 1 ( column 4 ) is the mean of the standard deviations of the mst edge lengths , @xmath32 , this quantity is used in appendix  [ graham ] .",
    "table  [ measures ] shows that for artificial clusters of type 2d@xmath4 , 3d@xmath4 and @xmath137 , both @xmath8 and @xmath2 decrease monotonically as @xmath4 increases ( i.e. the degree of central concentration becomes more severe ) or as @xmath7 decreases ( i.e. the degree of sub - clustering become more severe ) .",
    "however , @xmath2 decreases more quickly than @xmath8 as @xmath4 is increased , while @xmath8 decreases more quickly than @xmath2 as @xmath7 is decreased .",
    "thus , the ratio @xmath138 yields a measure which not only quantifies , but also distinguishes between , a smooth overall radial density gradient and multi - scale fractal sub - clustering .",
    "mean values of @xmath0 for the various types of artificial star cluster are recorded in table 1 ( column 5 ) . for artificial clusters with a smooth large - scale radial density gradient ( type 3d@xmath4 ) , @xmath139 increases from @xmath140 to @xmath141 as the degree of central concentration increases from @xmath142 ( statistically uniform number - density ) to @xmath143 ( @xmath144 ) . for artificial clusters with fractal sub - structure ( type f@xmath7 ) ,",
    "@xmath139 decreases from @xmath140 to @xmath145 as the degree of sub - clustering increases from @xmath146 ( uniform number - density , no sub - clustering ) to @xmath147 ( strong sub - clustering ) .",
    "we can therefore construct a plot ( figure  [ qplot ] ) of @xmath7 against @xmath0 for @xmath148 , and @xmath4 against @xmath0 for @xmath149 . for any real cluster",
    "we can compute its @xmath0 value , and then use figure  [ qplot ] to read off its notional fractal dimension @xmath25 ( if @xmath150 , implying sub - clustering ) , or its radial density exponent @xmath4 ( if @xmath151 , implying a large - scale radial density gradient ) .",
    "the small kink at @xmath152 is due to the fact in constructing a cluster of type f3.0 the stars are positioned regularly ( in the sense that at each generation , each subcube of space is occupied ) and therefore the number - density is artificially uniform ; in contrast , when we construct a cluster of type 3d0 the stars are positioned randomly , so that the density is only uniform in a statistical sense and there are poisson fluctuations in the local density .",
    "fractal dimensions obtained from fig .  [ qplot ] in this way are only notional , because @xmath0 ( or any other single measure ) can reflect sub - clustering , but can not capture whether the sub - clustering is hierarchically self - similar .    using figure  [ qplot ]",
    ", we infer that taurus , ic2391 and chamaeleon have substructure with notional fractal dimensions @xmath153 .",
    "in contrast , @xmath14 ophiuchus and ic348 appear to be centrally concentrated , with radial density exponents @xmath154 .",
    "these inferences agree well with an intuitive reading of the raw data shown in fig .",
    "[ realfield ] .",
    "the mst will normally link a star to its binary companion , as this will usually be the shortest way of adding one or other of the stars to the tree .",
    "binaries create very short edges and therefore a large population of binary stars will cause a noticeable reduction in the mean edge length , @xmath8 . of the five real clusters considered in this paper , taurus has been subjected to particularly close scrutiny and has a larger identified population of binaries than any of the others .",
    "as the binaries are not part of the clustering regime , it is important to establish whether they are distorting the result .    using the mst , all pairs of stars lying closer together than @xmath155 of the cluster radius",
    "were pruned , leaving single stars .",
    "for chamaeleon , @xmath14 ophiuchus , ic348 and ic2391 , only 3 , 0 , 1 and 2 such pairs were found ; taurus , however , was pruned from 215 down to only 137 primary stars .",
    "for the pruned version of taurus , @xmath2 increased from 0.55 to 0.57 , while @xmath8 increased from 0.26 to 0.33 and @xmath0 increased from 0.47 to 0.58 .",
    "removal of the binaries resulted in the notional fractal dimension for taurus being increased from 1.5 to 1.9 .",

    "the ratio of the normalized mean edge length to the normalized correlation length , @xmath0 , is effective in distinguishing between a smooth large - scale radial density gradient and multi - scale fractal sub - clustering , because it is sensitive not only to the frequency of small separations between stars , but also to their spatial distribution .",
    "the mst edge length @xmath8 is a simple average of the distances of stars to their ( usually ) closest neighbours .",

    "consequently , the quotient @xmath159 successfully distinguishes between clusters which have a smooth large - scale radial density gradient and clusters which have multi - scale fractal sub - clustering , in a way which agrees with an intuititive analysis but which can not be accomplished using existing methods such as larson plots or box dimension plots .",
    "an additional advantage over these methods is that the calculation of @xmath0 is quantitative and objective , as no intervention is required in the normalisation process , in the construction of the mst , or in choosing a range over which to calculate a slope .",
    "we should emphasize that classical methods for evaluating the density profile of a cluster , or its fractal dimension , are not viable for clusters with @xmath160 200 members , primarily because of low - number statistics .",
    "for example , if one attempts to define the projected radial density profile for a real cluster of stars by counting stars in different annuli , the result is very noisy .",
    "alternatively , if one attempts to determine the mean projected radial density profile for a 200-member artificial cluster having a given radial density profile in three dimensions , using many different realizations and with a view to comparing this with a real cluster , one finds that the standard deviation is very large , and so the diagnostic power of this profile is poor .    in the same spirit",
    "one might attempt to construct the box dimension plot ( bdp ) of a real cluster and compare it with the mean bdp of artificial star clusters having a given fractal dimension . to construct a bdp one",
    "divides the projected image of the star cluster into a grid of square cells of side @xmath161 and counts the number of cells , @xmath162 which are occupied by stars .",
    "then , by repeating this for different values of @xmath161 , one obtains a plot of @xmath163 against @xmath164 . for a true fractal",
    "this plot is a straight line with slope equal to the fractal dimension .",
    "however , for a star cluster with only @xmath165 members , the plot is not linear . by treating many realisations of artificial clusters all having the same fractal dimension _ and the same number of stars _ , one can define a mean bdp .",
    "however , the mean bdp is not very strongly dependent on the fractal dimension and it has a large standard deviation",
    ". therefore the box dimension plot of a real cluster does not give a useful constraint on its fractal dimension .",
    "it is for this reason that we have sought integral measures of cluster structure .",
    "the same philosophy informs the use of equivalent width when evaluating noisy spectral lines ( for example ) .",
    "we also note that a cluster can not have a large - scale radial density gradient , and at the same time be fractally sub - clustered .",
    "a cluster could have a large - scale radial density gradient and _ non - fractal _ sub - clustering ",
    "but then it would require more parameters to characterize the structure , and its diagnosis would become correspondingly more difficult ( if not impossible for clusters with @xmath160 200 stars ) .    in table 2",
    "we list estimates for the ages and the crossing times of the clusters we have analyzed . on the basis of simple arguments",
    ", we might expect the @xmath0 value of a cluster to increase with time , as the substructure dissolves and the overall cluster relaxes to a radially concentrated density profile . however , this is not evident in the small sample treated here .",
    "taurus has an age much less than its crossing time , which is consistent with its small @xmath0 value and low fractal dimension .",
    "on the other hand , ic2391 and chamaeleon have ages much greater than their crossing times and yet they are still fractal with relatively low @xmath0 values . in contrast , @xmath14 ophiuchus and ic348 , which have ages comparable with their crossing times , are both centrally condensed , with no discernible substructure .",
    "we should , however , caution against drawing firm conclusions from such a small sample",
    ". we also note that young clusters observed at short wavelengths ( i.e. in the optical ) , may appear to have substructure due to patchy observation . therefore long wavelength surveys are preferable for embedded young star clusters .",
    "we have explored two statistical measures for analysing objectively the observed ( i.e. projected ) structures of star clusters .",
    "these measures are based on the mean surface density of companions ( msdc ) , and the minimal spanning tree ( mst ) .",
    "the measures are @xmath2 , the normalised mean separation between stars , and @xmath8 , the normalised mean edge - length of the mst , both of which are independent of the number of stars in the cluster . for artificial star clusters , created with a smooth large - scale radial density profile ( @xmath3 ) , and for artificial star clusters created with sub - structure having fractal dimension @xmath7",
    ", @xmath2 and @xmath8 both decrease with increasing @xmath4 and/or decreasing @xmath7  but at different rates . hence a cluster with a radial gradient can be distinguished from one with sub - structure by evaluating @xmath159 . for a cluster of uniform volume - density ( i.e. @xmath142 and @xmath146 ) , @xmath166 .",
    "if the cluster is made more centrally condensed by increasing @xmath4 , @xmath0 increases monotonically , reaching @xmath167 at @xmath143 .",
    "conversely , if the cluster is given sub - structure by reducing @xmath7 , @xmath0 decreases monotonically , reaching @xmath168 at @xmath147 .    on the basis of their @xmath0 values , @xmath14 ophiuchus and ic348",
    "have radial gradients with @xmath169 , and @xmath170 , respectively .",
    "chamaeleon and ic2391 have sub - structure with notional fractal dimension @xmath171 .",
    "taurus has even more sub - structure , with @xmath172 , and if the binaries in taurus are treated as single systems , @xmath25 increases to @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath25 is only a notional fractal dimension , because the integral measures we have defined do not give any indication of whether the sub - structure is hierarchically self - similar .",
    "( indeed , for clusters having only @xmath160 200 stars the range of separations is too small to possess hierarchical self - similarity . )",
