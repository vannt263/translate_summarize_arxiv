    "in a previous paper@xcite ( henceforth referred to as i ) we began a study of the effects on interband transitions of the scattering of electrons from static imperfections in a semiconductor superlattice . a uniform static electric field was applied .",
    "it has long been recognized that scattering destroys the coherence necessary to sustain the bloch oscillations predicted in such a field , and in practice this delayed the observation of these oscillations until the development of semiconductor superlattices@xcite . but the scattering destroys other types of interesting coherent motion , as well .",
    "dunlap and kenkre@xcite , in particular , looked at the effects on dynamic localization of electrons in time periodic electric fields .",
    "we were interested in i in a multiband effect , the rabi oscillations@xcite of electron population between bands of a crystal in a uniform static electric field of appropriate magnitude  near an avoided crossing of the two interpenetrating wannier - stark ladders ( wsl ) arising essentially from different bands@xcite .",
    "these are the so - called zener resonances . within a simple two - band tight - binding model we demonstrated the destruction of localization ( of occupied electron states ) to a single miniband by the dephasing associated with the scattering .",
    "the decay rate for the approach to steady state band populations exhibits sharp peaks at values of the static electric field which give zener resonances in the absence of scattering .",
    "the specific approximations in i , however , effectively limited the results to the case of infinite temperature .",
    "in particular , the steady state was assumed to be equal population of the two bands . in this paper",
    "we remove that restriction , to discuss these effects at finite temperature .",
    "the necessary modification was described in ref .",
    "( ) , namely relaxation of band populations toward values set by the boltzmann factors describing thermal equilibrium .",
    "this will allow us , in particular , to look at the electric current , a quantity of obvious experimental interest which vanishes in the infinite temperature limit .",
    "we consider the same model that we treated in i , a standard simple tight - binding model@xcite of a two - band system in a static electric field e. the hamiltonian  can be written as @xmath0 .",
    "\\label{ham } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the subscripts label the lattice sites and the lower and upper minibands are designated by symbols @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "we have introduced the notation @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the lattice constant , for the bloch frequency , which will appear often below .",
    "the first two terms describe the site energies of the wannier states in the presence of the electric field , and @xmath5 are the widths of the isolated ( @xmath6 ) minibands induced by nearest neighbor hopping : @xmath7 , where the dimensionless wave vector @xmath8 is in units of the inverse lattice constant @xmath4 .",
    "the last term is the on - site electric dipole coupling between minibands ; @xmath9 is the corresponding dipole moment .",
    "this hamiltonian does neglect coulomb interactions and electric dipole elements between wannier states on different sites , but it contains the essential physics for the problem@xcite .",
    "note that the hopping parameters @xmath5 are written here with opposite signs , so that with both parameters positive the band structure at @xmath10 is of the standard nearly free electron character , with direct band gaps at the zone boundary .",
    "but the calculation to follow is valid for arbitrary signs of the parameters .",
    "it is easily shown@xcite that the exact spectrum of @xmath11 is two interpenetrating wannier - stark ladders .",
    "but what do the corresponding states represent in terms of the occupation of the original bands as a function of time , and what is the influence of scattering ? for vanishing dipole matrix element between bands , @xmath12 , there is no interband mixing .",
    "each of the two bands gives rise to a single wsl .",
    "clearly , when the electric field amplitude is such that the ladders become degenerate , even small values of @xmath13 lead to strong interband mixing .",
    "the crossing of the ladders is  avoided \" by any finite @xmath13 , and the behavior near those avoided crossings ( the zener resonances ) is of particular importance and interest .",
    "in general there are peaks in the current response at those values of the electric field , but the peaks are broadened by increasing temperature , as well as by decreasing bandwidth relative to band separation .",
    "we start by defining the density matrix in the representation of the two bands , @xmath14 where @xmath15 or @xmath16 are band indices : @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) and @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) designate @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) and @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) , respectively . since we are interested in the dynamics of occupation of various band states , it is convenient to work in a wave vector basis , by fourier transforming the density matrix . in general , since @xmath25 is not translationally invariant ( a function only of @xmath26 ) , we have a full set @xmath27 $ ] of fourier components .",
    "but we will be interested in the wave vector diagonal band occupation numbers @xmath28 .",
    "then at finite temperature @xmath29 we insist that the wave vector and band diagonal occupation number relax to the thermal equilibrium value , @xmath30 where @xmath31 , the sum in the partition function is over @xmath32 and over all wave vectors @xmath33 , and the band energies are those given above , @xmath34    within a constant relaxation rate approximation@xcite , the density matrix @xmath35 satisfies the following stochastic liouville equation ( sle ) ( we set @xmath36 throughout this paper ) , @xmath37-i\\gamma \\left[\\rho(t ) - \\rho_t\\right ] .",

    "the parameters @xmath42 measure the loss of phase coherence between sites , or the scattering lifetime of band states labeled by quasimomentum .",

    "the structure is exactly the same as eqs .",
    "( 17 - 19 ) in i , except for the @xmath8-dependent relaxation of @xmath62 here .",
    "as we did there , we can integrate these equations analytically as a perturbation series in the parameter @xmath63 , which characterizes the electric dipole coupling between bands .",

    "@xmath67 the instantaneous current is given by the sum over wave vectors of the relevant electron velocity @xmath68 times the number density in that band at that wave vector , @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the number of carriers per unit area in each cell of the superlattice . in terms of the convenient quantities",

    "the interband effects are all contained in the second term on the right hand side of ( [ javg ] ) , proportional to @xmath81 .",
    "the zener resonances , near @xmath82 , with @xmath80 an integer , exhibit themselves as peaks in the factors @xmath83 .",
    "we will look at the nonlinear conductance , the current as a function of increasing electric field , which is conveniently parameterized in the dimensionless form @xmath84 . at sufficiently high fields ,",
    "as the wannier - stark functions become increasingly localized in space , the current falls off inversely with @xmath85 . to the extent that the interband contribution can be neglected ( small @xmath64 ) the field dependence of the response is given by the factor @xmath86 , with an  esaki - tsu \" peak@xcite near @xmath87 .",
    "there are two sources of temperature dependence in ( [ javg ] ) .",
    "the first is the explicit appearance of @xmath88 in the factors @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the other is implicit ; the relaxation rate @xmath91 is ordinarily also temperature dependent .",
    "though that can be modeled for a specific relaxation mechanism , we simply take it to be constant below . at high temperatures , with @xmath92 , @xmath93 , we have @xmath89 and @xmath90 approximately linear in @xmath94 ; the current @xmath95 also therefore falls off as @xmath96 .",
    "this is the well known effect of approaching uniform thermal population of the states throughout each band as the temperature rises ; at complete uniformity the current vanishes .",
    "all of these effects are seen in fig .",
    "1 , where the interband matrix element @xmath64 has been set equal to zero , and @xmath97 . the second term on the right hand side of eq . ( [ javg ] )",
    "is then absent , and the single remaining peak arises from the first term in that equation . to avoid a multiplicity of parameters we have taken the two bandwidths to be equal , @xmath98 . in the remaining figures we have set the interband coupling to be @xmath99 . again",
    "@xmath100 , with increasing values @xmath101 0.4 and 0.8 in figs . 2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "each figure gives results for three values of the parameter @xmath92 , namely 1 , 10 and 100 .",
    "the value of unity is representative of a typical superlattice , of lattice parameter of order 100    and carrier effective mass @xmath102 , at room temperature . from eq .",
    "( [ javg ] ) we see that the height in @xmath95 of the @xmath80th peak ( for values of @xmath80 up to 5 or 6 , where @xmath103 ) , at @xmath104 is approximately proportional to @xmath105 ^ 2j_{n-1}^2(nw/\\delta)$ ] .",
    "the bessel function overlap factors increase rapidly with increasing bandwidth @xmath106 over the range we have chosen for @xmath106 , and so we see more well - defined zener resonance peaks with increasing bandwidth , going from fig . 2 to fig .",
    "3 . the major effect of increasing the damping rate @xmath91 is to broaden the peaks in the current . thus ,",
    "for the particular choice of @xmath101 0.4 and @xmath99 , we can compare the results for @xmath107 in fig . 4 and @xmath108 in fig .",
    "5 with the previous curves for @xmath109 in fig .",
    "within a simple two - band tight binding model we have studied the electric current response of a semiconductor superlattice subject to a finite uniform electric field .",
    "relaxation processes have been assumed markoffian , and they have been described by a single parameter characterizing the rate at which a nonequilibrium density is restored to thermal equilibrium , using a stochastic liouville equation .",
    "we have been particularly interested in the interband transitions , which lead to current peaks near the values of external field where zener resonances occur .",
    "we have exhibited the variation in height and width of these peaks , as well as in the overall current magnitude with temperature and with the various parameters of the theory , including bandwidth , band separation , interband dipole coupling , and relaxation rate .",
    "the results we have obtained are perturbational in @xmath64 ; we do require weak interband coupling .",
    "moreover , we have limited the discussion to a single pair of bands , assuming the impact of all other bands to be negligible on the zener tunneling between these two .",
    "this can be realized in practice by using a dimerized semiconductor superlattice with , for example , uniform wells but alternating thick and thin barriers between them . with weak alternation of barrier thickness",
    "one can adjust a pair of bands resulting from the doubling of the unit cell to be well isolated from all other bands , and the predictions of this paper can be studied in such a system by varying the external uniform electric field .",
    "another way to observe the effects predicted here is to use ultracold atoms in accelerating optical potentials .",
    "recently , rabi oscillations were observed in such a system , where the interband coupling was generated by a small phase modulation @xcite .",
    "very low temperatures can be realized in these systems , and it should be possible to observe the resonant structures in current that we have predicted in this paper .",
