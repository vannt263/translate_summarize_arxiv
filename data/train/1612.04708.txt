    "about 15% of upper main sequence stars between spectral types early b to early f are characterised by atmospheric chemical abundances that differ significantly from the solar pattern . accordingly ,",
    "these objects are referred to as chemically peculiar ( cp ) stars .",
    "the observed peculiarity is believed to be produced by selective processes ( radiative levitation , gravitational settling ) operating in calm radiative atmospheres @xcite .",
    "cp stars are not confined to a particular evolutionary stage and are natural atomic and magnetic laboratories .",
    "furthermore , because of their unusual composition characterised by significant under- or overabundances of several elements , they are ideally suited as testing grounds for the evaluation of model atmospheres .",
    "cp stars are intrinsically slow rotators , and it is thought that the meridional currents induced by the rapid rotation of hot main sequence stars will counteract the effects of the segregation of chemical elements , thus effectively preventing the formation of the characteristic abundance anomalies of the cp stars .",
    "therefore , an upper limit for rotational velocities is expected , beyond which no chemical peculiarities due to the above mentioned interplay of radiative diffusion and gravitational settling are expected .",
    "establishing this upper limit is an important task , which might contribute to the understanding of the influence of rotational mixing on chemical peculiarities .    according to , cp stars",
    "are commonly subdivided into four classes : metallic line ( or am ) stars ( cp1 ) , magnetic ap stars ( cp2 ) , hgmn stars ( cp3 ) , and he - weak stars ( cp4 ) .",
    "the cp1 stars are a- and early f - type stars and are defined by the discrepancies found in the spectral types derived from the strength of the ca ii k line , the hydrogen lines , and the metallic lines . in comparison to the spectral types derived from the hydrogen lines , the ca ii k - line types appear too early and the metallic - line types too late , i.e. sp(k)@xmath6sp(h)@xmath6sp(m )  with , obviously , the requirement sp(k)<sp(m ) @xcite . in classical cp1 stars ,",
    "sp(k ) and sp(m ) differ by five or more spectral subclasses ; stars in which the difference is less are often referred to as marginal am ( or am : ) stars .",
    "cp1 stars do not show strong , global magnetic fields and are characterised by underabundances of calcium and scandium and overabundances of the iron - peak and heavier elements .",
    "cp1 stars are mostly members of binary systems with orbital periods between 2@xmath6@xmath7@xmath610 d , and their rotational velocities are believed to have been reduced by tidal interactions , which has enabled diffusion to act @xcite .",
    "the cp2 stars are distinguished by their strong , globally organised magnetic fields that range up from about  300 gauss to several tens of kilogauss @xcite .",
    "below the above mentioned threshold , global magnetic fields are thought to be sheared by differential rotation .",
    "cp2 stars are notorious for exhibiting a nonuniform distribution of chemical elements , which is likely connected to the presence of the magnetic field and results in the formation of spots and patches of enhanced element abundance .",
    "these inhomogeneities are responsible for the strictly periodic changes observed in the spectra and brightness of many cp2 stars , which are explained by the oblique rotator model @xcite .",
    "thus , the observed periodicity of variation is the rotational period of the star .",
    "the photometric variability in cp2 stars is thought to result from redistribution of flux in the surface abundance spots .",
    "cp2 stars exhibiting photometric variability are traditionally referred to as @xmath8 canum venaticorum ( acv ) variables ( * ? ? ?",
    "* gcvs hereafter ) .    in the region of the a and f - type stars , where most of the target stars of the present investigation are situated , the @xmath2 doradus ( gcvs - type gdor ) and @xmath3 scuti ( gcvs - type dsct ) pulsators are found .",
    "the gdor stars exhibit high - order , low - degree , non - radial g - mode pulsations @xcite which are driven by convective blocking at the base of the envelope convection zone @xcite .",
    "they were identified as a new class of variable stars by @xcite and defined as such by @xcite .",
    "according to the gcvs , they are found between spectral types a7 to f7 .",
    "other literature sources narrow this down to a7 to f5 ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the dsct stars , on the other hand , have long been established as a class of variable stars and show low - order g- and p - modes which are self - excited through the @xmath9 mechanism ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "according to @xcite and the gcvs , they are mostly found among spectral types a0 to f5 .",
    "other sources ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have revised the blue border of the dsct instability strip towards cooler temperatures , corresponding to a spectral type of @xmath10a2 , which is what we adopt in the present investigation ( cf . figure 2 ) .",
    "gdor and dsct stars are easily distinguished by the timescales of the observed variability .",
    "however , the instability strips for both classes partially overlap and hybrid - types are encountered ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "different classification criteria are found in the literature . according to the gcvs",
    ", gdor stars are found in the period range of 0.3@xmath6@xmath11@xmath63 days ( 0.33@xmath6@xmath12@xmath63.33 c / d ) , while dsct pulsators are characterized by variability in the range of 0.01@xmath6@xmath11@xmath60.2 days ( 5@xmath6@xmath12@xmath6100 c / d ) .",
    "@xcite proposed a division into pure dsct stars ( @xmath12>5c / d ) , pure gdor stars ( @xmath12<5c / d ) , and hybrid - types exhibiting variability in both frequency regimes .",
    "hybrid - type pulsators are mostly discovered in ultra - precise space photometry but their frequency of occurrence ( @xmath1025% of the sample of ) has made clear that the picture is complex and the traditional classification scheme might be in need of revision .",
    "the understanding and relationship of dsct and gdor pulsators is currently in flux ( e.g. , cf .",
    "also @xcite ) .",
    "for many years , the generally held consensus was that  except in marginal or evolved cp1 stars ",
    "pulsations are absent from classical cp1 stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , the gravitational settling of helium was proposed to interfere with the @xmath9 mechanism operating in the he ii ionisation zone , thus effectively preventing e.g. dsct - type pulsations . however , this understanding had to be revoked when @xcite identified the classical am star hd 1097 as a dsct star .",
    "several investigations have been carried out to investigate pulsational variability in cp1 stars in the recent past , which have shown that pulsational variability of gdor- and dsct - type is in fact quite common among this group of stars .",
    "@xcite found no significant difference in the location of cp1 dsct pulsators and non - cp dsct variables in the hertzsprung - russell diagram ( hrd ) . according to @xcite , dsct pulsations in cp1 stars",
    "are mostly encountered in the temperature range 6900 @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath13 7600 k. there is evidence that cp1 pulsators exhibit dsct pulsations with reduced amplitudes in comparison to normal dsct stars but this has not been conclusively established @xcite .",
    "the results concerning the percentage of pulsators among cp1 stars are partly conflicting ( see e.g. the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "a potential link between chemical peculiarities and hybrid - type pulsation has been proposed @xcite .",
    "concerning cp2 stars , the only proven form of pulsational variability is observed in the so - called rapidly oscillating ap ( roap ) stars @xcite .",
    "the possible presence of gdor and dsct pulsations in ap stars have been reported in the literature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but this is still a controversial matter .",
    "roap stars exhibit photometric variability with very small amplitudes in the period range of about 5 - 20 min ( high - overtone , low - degree , and non - radial pulsation modes ) , which is very different from what has been observed for the targets of the present investigation .",
    "it is important to increase the sample size of pulsating cp stars in order to disentangle what mechanisms are at work in these objects , which offer the singular opportunity to study the interaction of atomic diffusion , pulsation , and rotation .",
    "the present paper presents an investigation of three cp stars and one cp star candidate which have been identified as hitherto uncatalogued photometrically variable stars during the ongoing search for new acv variables in public sky survey data .",
    "newly acquired spectra are presented that confirm the status of our sample stars as chemically peculiar objects , and new photometric observations were acquired in order to verify the results derived from sky survey data .",
    "detailed period analyses have been carried out for all objects .",
    "furthermore , we have derived astrophysical parameters and investigated our sample stars in the @xmath0 versus @xmath1 diagram .",
    "target stars and observations are described in section [ target_stars_and_observations ] ; data are analysed and results are presented in section [ data_analysis_and_discussion_of_results ] .",
    "we conclude in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "except for hd 77013 , all objects analysed in this paper are known or suspected cp stars from the catalogue of ap , hgmn , and am stars that have been identified as photometrically variable during our efforts in finding new acv variables .",
    "hd 77013 is a late a - type star that was included as a candidate acv variable in .",
    "table 1 provides essential data for the target stars of the present investigation , which are listed in order of increasing right ascension .",
    "positional information was taken from the tycho-2 catalogue .",
    "the @xmath15 and @xmath16 indices magnitude of hd 98000 has been based on poor photometry .",

    "the @xmath18 magnitude range was derived from road ( hd 67983 ; see section [ new_ccd_photometry ] for a description of the road data ) and asas-3 ( all other objects ) @xmath18-band data .",
    "spectral types given were taken from rm09 ( hd 67983 , hd 81076 , hd 98000 ) , and ( * ? ? ?",

    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     without a doubt , hd 98000 is a classical cp2 star of the silicon subgroup",
    ". the only proven form of pulsational variability among this type of cp stars is observed in the so - called rapidly oscillating ap ( roap ) stars @xcite which exhibit photometric variability in the period range of @xmath105 - 20min ( high - overtone , low - degree , and non - radial pulsation modes ) .",
    "this is very different from what has been observed for hd 98000 .",
    "have shown that other kinds of pulsational variability might exist in magnetic cp stars ; however , the object investigated by the aforementioned authors has evolved significantly away from the terminal age main sequence and is thus no classical cp2 star and presumably in a very different evolutionary state than hd 98000 .    generally , photometric variability in cp2 stars is considered to be caused by rotational modulation due to the redistribution of flux in the surface abundance spots .",
    "hence the observed photometric period is the rotational period of the star ; photometrically variable cp2 stars are traditionally referred to as acv variables .",
    "acv variables are in almost all cases monoperiodic , which  in the accuracy limit of the available data  is also true for hd 98000 .    from the available data , we propose rotational modulation as the underlying cause of the observed photometric variability in the monoperiodic , classical cp2 star hd 98000 .",
    "provide a list of the fastest rotating cp2 stars discovered to this date , whose rotational periods cluster around a value of @xmath19 0.52d ( hr 7355 , @xmath11 = 0.52144d ; hd 164429 , @xmath11 = 0.51899d ; cu vir , @xmath11 = 0.52070d ; hd 92385 , @xmath11 = 0.54909d ) . with a period of @xmath19 0.466days , hd 98000 would be the acv variable with the shortest period hitherto observed .",
    "however , as acv variables are prone to exhibit double - wave variations and the observed amplitude of variability is very small for hd 98000 , a twice longer rotation period can not be definitely excluded .",
    "furthermore , due to the strong aliasing inherent to both datasets , we can not exclude the possibility that our derived period is an alias of the true value . however , as the proposed frequency has been unambiguously identified in both datasets , and the data folded on @xmath20",
    "do not show a convincing phase plot , current evidence favours the period solution proposed above .",
    "if our assumption concerning the origin of the photometric variability and the derived period is proven to be true , hd 98000 is the acv variable with the shortest period hitherto observed and hence a very interesting object that might help to investigate the influence of rotational mixing on chemical peculiarities and define an upper limit for rotational velocities , beyond which no chemical peculiarities due to the interplay of radiative diffusion and gravitational settling are expected .",
    "we therefore strongly encourage further photometric and phase - resolved spectroscopic observations of hd 98000 in order to unravel the underlying mechanism of variability .",
    "we have carried out an investigation of four photometrically variable chemically peculiar stars .",
    "new spectroscopic observations were acquired which confirm the peculiar composition of all targets .",
    "hd 77013 and hd 81076 are classical cp1 ( am ) stars ; hd 67983 is a marginal cp1 ( am : ) star , and hd 98000 is a cp2 ( ap ) star showing enhanced lines of silicon .",
    "we have derived astrophysical parameters and investigated our sample stars in the @xmath0 versus @xmath1 diagram , from which we derive information on evolutionary status .",
    "we have discussed each object and presented detailed period analyses that have been based on publicly available data from the asas-3 and superwasp archives as well as our own photometric observations .",
    "taking into account all available data , we propose pulsations as the underlying mechanism of the variability observed in hd 67983 , hd 77013 and hd 81076 .",
    "hd 67983 and hd 77013 exhibit multiperiodic variability in the @xmath2 doradus frequency realm ; hd 81076 was identified as a @xmath3 scuti star .",
    "we intend to obtain high - resolution spectroscopic observations of our target stars , which will be presented in a forthcoming paper .    the cp2 star hd 98000 exhibits monoperiodic variability with a frequency of @xmath21 2.148 c / d ( @xmath19 0.466 d ) , which we interpret as the rotational period . if our assumption is verified , hd 98000 is the acv variable with the shortest period hitherto observed and thus a very interesting object that might help to investigate the influence of rotational mixing on chemical peculiarities .",
    "we therefore strongly encourage phase - resolved observations of hd 98000 in order to unravel the underlying mechanism of variability .",

    "<S> we present an investigation of three chemically peculiar ( cp ) stars and one cp star candidate which exhibit photometric periods below 12 hours . </S>",
    "<S> new spectroscopic observations have been acquired which confirm the peculiar nature of all objects . </S>",
    "<S> hd 77013 and hd 81076 are classical cp1 ( am ) stars ; hd 67983 is a marginal cp1 ( am : ) star , and hd 98000 is a cp2 ( ap ) star . </S>",
    "<S> we have procured observations from the asas-3 and superwasp archives and obtained additional photometry in order to verify the results from the sky survey data . </S>",
    "<S> we have derived astrophysical parameters and investigated the positions of our target stars in the @xmath0 versus @xmath1 diagram , from which information on evolutionary status has been derived . </S>",
    "<S> we present period analyses and discuss each object in detail . from the available data , we propose pulsational variability as the underlying mechanism for the variability in hd 67983 , hd 77013 and hd 81076 , which offer the opportunity to study the interaction of atomic diffusion and pulsation . </S>",
    "<S> hd 67983 and hd 77013 exhibit multiperiodic variability in the @xmath2 doradus frequency realm ; hd 81076 is a @xmath3 scuti star . </S>",
    "<S> the cp2 star hd 98000 exhibits monoperiodic variability with a frequency of f@xmath42.148 c / d ( p@xmath40.466 d ) , which we interpret as the rotational period . </S>",
    "<S> if this assumption is correct , hd 98000 is the @xmath5 canum venaticorum ( acv ) variable with the shortest period hitherto observed and thus a very interesting object that might help to investigate the influence of rotational mixing on chemical peculiarities .    </S>",
