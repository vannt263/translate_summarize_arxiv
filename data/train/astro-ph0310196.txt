    "it is a remarkable feature that various properties of galaxies vary according to their environments . in 1926 ,",
    "hubble classified galaxies according to their morphology along the tuning fork diagram ( figure [ fig : hubble ] ) .",
    "this is the so - called hubble s tuning fork diagram , and is still commonly used to understand variety in galaxy morphology .",
    "however , little is known on the origin of this variety in galaxy morphology .",
    "it has been known for a long time that galaxy cluster regions are dominated by bright elliptical galaxies , whereas star - forming spiral galaxies are more numerous in the field .",
    "many people observed that cluster elliptical galaxies have tight correlation between their color and magnitude ( so - called color - magnitude relation ) .",
    "this variety in galaxy properties and correlation with galaxy environments have driven many researchers to study galaxies and clusters . however , only little has been known on the origin of this variety in galaxies .",
    "the purpose of this work is to clarify observationally environment - dependent effects which affect galaxy properties causing the evolution of galaxies , in order to understand underlying physical mechanism governing this variety in properties of present day galaxies .        in his pioneering work ,",
    "dressler ( 1980 ) studied 55 nearby clusters and found that the fraction of elliptical galaxies are higher in the denser regions such as cluster cores .",
    "this correlation between galaxy morphology and its environment is called the morphology - density relation , and has been observed by so many people until today .",
    "postman & geller ( 1984 ) extended morphology study to galaxy groups ( typically a group consists of a few to dozens of galaxies . ) using the data from the cfa redshift survey ( huchra et al .",
    "the relation was completely consistent with dressler ( 1980 ) . at low densities below galaxy density",
    "@xmath45 mpc@xmath5 , population fractions seems to be independent of environment . at high density above @xmath43000 galaxies",
    "mpc@xmath5 , the elliptical fraction increased steeply .",
    "whitmore et al .",
    "( 1993 ) re - analyzed the 55 nearby clusters studied by dressler ( 1980 ) and argued that the morphology - radius relation is more fundamental ; the correlation between morphology and cluster centric radius seems tighter than the morphology - density relation .",
    "dressler et al . ( 1997 ) studied 10 high redshift clusters at @xmath60.5 and found that the morphology - density relation is seen for centrally concentrated clusters .",
    "however , the relation was nearly absent for less concentrated or irregular clusters .",
    "fasano et al .",
    "( 2000 ) studied nine clusters at intermediate redshift ( 0.1@xmath70.25 ) and found that morphology - density relation in clusters with high elliptical concentration , but not in those with low elliptical concentration .",
    "hashimoto et al . ( 1999 ) used data from las campanas redshift survey ( lcrs ; shectman et al .",
    "1996 ) to study the concentration - density relation .",
    "they found that the ratio of high to low concentrated galaxies decreases smoothly with decreasing density .",
    "dominguez et al .",
    "( 2001 ) analyzed nearby clusters with x - ray and found that mechanisms of global nature ( x - ray mass density ) dominate in high density environments , namely the virialized regions of clusters , while local galaxy density is the relevant parameter in the outskirts where the influence of cluster as a whole is relatively small compared to local effects .",
    "dominguez et al .",
    "( 2002 ) studied groups in 2df galaxy group catalog using pca analysis of spectra as a galaxy classification and local galaxy density from redshift space as a measure of galaxy environment .",
    "they found that both morphology - density relation and morphology - group - centric radius relation is clearly seen in high mass ( @xmath810@xmath9 ) groups , but neither relation is observed for low mass ( @xmath1010@xmath9 ) groups .",
    "apparently previous studies have shown the fact that there is a correlation between galaxy morphology and environment . however , previous studies often had the following uncertainties ; ( i ) two dimensional density estimation from the imaging data , ( ii ) subjective , eye - based galaxy classification , ( iii ) lack of the field data .",
    "therefore , it is important to rectify these problems using a larger , more uniform data with three dimensional information , such as the sdss data used in this work .",
    "furthermore , to understand the underlying physical mechanism , it is of importance to specify the exact environment where galaxy morphology starts to change and the accurate amount of galaxies which undergo morphological change .",
    "we try to address these problems using the sdss data in chapter [ chap : md ] .",
    "in addition to clarify various correlations between galaxy properties as have been claimed in previous work , high quality and large quantity of the sdss data offers us , for the first time , a chance to understand underlying physical mechanisms .      similarly , there have been extensive evidence that cluster galaxies have smaller amount of star formation , with redder colors than field galaxies .",
    "it has been known for a long time that cluster regions lack emission line galaxies ( osterbrook 1960 ; gisler 1978 ; dressler , thompson , & shectman 1985 ) .",
    "recently , many studies reported that star formation in the cores of clusters is much lower than that in the surrounding field ( e.g. , balogh et al .",
    "1997,1998,1999 ; poggianti et al . 1999",
    "; martin , lotz & ferguson 2000 ; couch et al .",
    "2001 ; balogh et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "in addition , it is becoming possible to specify the environment where star formation in galaxies starts to change .",
    "abraham et al.(1996 ) reported that cluster members become progressively bluer as a function of cluster - centric distance out to 5 mpc in a2390 ( @xmath110.23 ) .",
    "van dokkum et al . (",
    "1998 ) found s0 galaxies in the outskirts of a cluster at @xmath110.33 .",
    "these s0s show a much wider scatter in their colors and are bluer on average than those in cluster cores , providing possible evidence for recent infall of galaxies from the field .",
    "terlevich , caldwell & bower ( 2001 ) reported that @xmath12 colors of early - type galaxies are systematically bluer at outside the core of coma cluster .",
    "pimbblet et al . (",
    "2002 ) studied 11 x - ray luminous clusters ( 0.07@xmath130.16 ) and found that median galaxy color shifts bluewards with decreasing local galaxy density . at higher redshifts , kodama et al .",
    "( 2001 ) reported that colors of galaxies abruptly change at sub - clump regions surrounding a cluster at @xmath110.41 . recently , using statistically much larger sample , lewis et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and gomez et al .",
    "( 2003 ) showed that star formation rate ( sfr ) of galaxies decreases toward cluster cores at around 1 virial radius .",
    "all of these results are often interpreted as the result of star - forming field disk galaxies infalling to a cluster , being transformed to passive cluster galaxies .",
    "it is of importance to observationally specify the environment where galaxy properties start to change and how much they change in order to understand the underlying physical mechanisms responsible for these differences .",
    "cluster galaxies are known to have tight color - magnitude relation .",
    "visvanathan & sandage ( 1977 ) noted that bright early - type galaxies in coma and eight other local clusters have a tight correlation between their colors and magnitude , in a sense that brighter galaxies have redder colors ( the color - magnitude relation ; cmr ) .",
    "bower , lucey & ellis ( 1992 ) later studied the cmr in detail using high precision photometry of early - type galaxies in virgo and coma clusters to find little scatter around the mean cmr .",
    "various other studies also confirmed the existence of tight cmr in both low redshift cluster ( sandage & visvanathan 1978 ; van dokkum et al .",
    "1998 ; pimbblet et al .",
    "2002 ) , and high redshift clusters(aragon - salamanca et al . 1993",
    "; stanford et al . 1995,1998 ; dickinson 1996 ; ellis et al . 1997 ; kodama et al . 1998 ; van dokkum et al .",
    "these studies are in remarkable agreement : the slope and scatter of the cmr seem to be roughly constant with passive evolution of an old stellar population formed at high redshift .",
    "the rms of scatter about the mean cmr is typically @xmath40.04 mag , a comparable size to observational errors , implying a virtually negligible intrinsic scatter .",
    "the universality of the cmr also suggests the different star formation history between field galaxies and cluster galaxies .",
    "it is one of the purposes of this study to observationally collect the evidence for cluster galaxy evolution in order to understand the underlying physical mechanisms governing cluster galaxy evolution .",
    "there also have been direct evidence for cluster galaxy evolution .",
    "butcher & oemler ( 1978 , 1984 ) found that fractions of blue galaxies are larger in the past , showing that cluster galaxies evolve from blue to red ( so - called the butcher - oemler effect ; figure [ fig : bo84 ] ) .",
    "butcher and oemler s work made a strong impact since it showed direct evidence for the evolution of cluster galaxies .",
    "much work regarding the nature of these blue galaxies followed .",
    "rakos & schombert ( 1995 ) found that the fraction of blue galaxies increases from 20% at @xmath110.4 to 80% at @xmath110.9 , suggesting that the evolution in clusters is even stronger than previously thought .",
    "margoniner & de carvalho ( 2000 ) studied 48 clusters in the redshift range of 0.03@xmath130.38 and detected a strong butcher - oemler effect consistent with that of rakos & schombert ( 1995 ) . despite the global trend with redshift ,",
    "almost all previous work has reported a wide range of blue fraction values at respective redshifts .",
    "in particular , in a large sample of 295 abell clusters , margoniner et al .",
    "( 2001 ) not only confirmed the existence of the butcher - oemler effect , but also found the blue fraction depends on cluster richness .",
    "ellingson et al . ( 2001 ) studied 15 cnoc1 clusters ( yee , ellingson , & carlberg 1996 ) between @xmath110.18 and @xmath110.55 . since they used spectroscopically",
    "observed galaxies , they do not suffer from the fore / background contamination ( but see diaferio et al .",
    "they used galaxies brighter than @xmath14 and found a blue fraction of @xmath40.15 at @xmath110.3 .",
    "in addition to the color evolution of cluster galaxies , morphological evolution of cluster galaxies have been observed .",
    "dressler et al . (",
    "1997 ) studied 10 high redshift clusters at @xmath60.5 and found that s0 fractions are much smaller than those in nearby clusters , suggesting that s0 galaxies are created fairly recently ( @xmath150.5 ; figure [ fig : d97 ] ) .",
    "fasano et al .",
    "( 2000 ) studied 9 intermediate redshift clusters and plotted morphological fraction as a function of redshift to find that s0 fraction decreases with increasing redshift , whereas spiral fraction increases with redshift .",
    "there also have been observations showing the deficit of s0 galaxies in high redshift clusters ( andreon et al .",
    "1997 ; couch et al .",
    "1998 ; lubin et al . 1998 ; but also see andreon et al . 1998 ; fabricant et al .",
    "these observational results show us that cluster galaxies are likely to evolve , changing their color from red to blue , and their morphology from late - type to early - type .    however , almost all of previous work had a fundamental problem in using a heterogeneous sample of clusters .",
    "for example , one can never claim the evolution by comparing low redshift clusters observed by a ground based telescope with high redshift clusters observed by @xmath16 .",
    "in such a case , high redshift clusters are much richer than low redshift clusters , and thus subjective to richness related bias .",
    "there have been many people who doubt such an evolutionary study with heterogeneous sample ( newberry , kirshner & boroson 1988 ; allington - smith et al .",
    "1993 ; garilli et al .",
    "1996 ; smail et al .",
    "1998 ; andreon & ettori 1999 ; balogh et al . 1999 ; fairley et al . 2002 ) . in chapter",
    "[ chap : bo ] , we try to rectify this problem using the largest sample of 514 clusters , uniformly selected from the same sdss data , eliminating a richness related and redshift related bias .",
    "various physical mechanisms have been proposed to explain the observational results on cluster galaxy evolution . in this section",
    ", we aim to summarize them by classifying them into three broad categories ; ( 1 ) interplay between galaxies and intra - cluster medium ( 2 ) galaxy - galaxy gravitational interaction .",
    "( 3 ) gravitational interaction between a galaxy and the cluster potential .    1 .   interplay between galaxies and intra - cluster medium .",
    "+ ram - pressure stripping of cold gas in the disk of a galaxy is a candidate since the star formation loses its source due to the removal of the cold gas .",
    "( gunn & gott 1972 ; farouki & shapiro 1980 ; kent 1981 ; fujita 1998 ; fujita & nagashima 1999 ; abadi , moore & bower 1999 ; quilis , moore & bower 2000 ; toniazzo & schndler 2001 ; fujita 2001,2003 ) .",
    "ram - pressure stripping is likely to be effective in the central region of clusters where density of intra - cluster medium ( icm ) is high . in fact , disk galaxies with a deficit of cold gas or a morphological sign of gas removal are often observed near cluster centers ( e.g. , cayatte et al .",

    "2000 , 2001 ; solanes et al . 2001",
    "; bureau & carignan 2002 ; vollmer 2003 ) .",
    "especially , haynes & giovanelli ( 1986 ) showed that the frequency of hi deficient galaxies projected on the sky increases close to the center of the virgo cluster .",
    "in addition , the ram - pressure stripping is predicted to be more effective in a richer cluster since the velocity of galaxies is larger ( bahcall 1977 ; fujita et al .",
    "1999,2001 ) .",
    "this prediction can be observationally tested by studying fractions of blue galaxies as a function of cluster richness .",
    "we perform such an attempt in chapter [ chap : md ] . on the other hand , star formation rates of galaxies",
    "may decrease gradually by stripping of warm halo gas that would later infall on to the galactic disks , and be the source of cold gas and stars in the galactic disks ( strangulation ; larson , tinsley & caldwell 1980 ; balogh et al . 2001 ; bekki et al . 2002 ; mo & mao 2002 ;",
    "oh & benson 2002 ) .",
    "if only warm halo gas is stripped , star formation may be allowed to continue by consuming remaining cold disk gas but , without infalling gas from halo to replenish this supply , star formation will die out on timescales of a few gyr ( larson et al . 1980 ) .",
    "observationally , finoguenov et al .",
    "( 2003 ) found in coma cluster the filamentary gas where strangulation is likely to be happening and they predicted quiescent star formation in galaxy disks around the filament . +",
    "another mechanism to slow down the star formation rate of galaxies is thermal evaporation of the cold gas in disk galaxies via heat conduction from the surrounding hot icm ( cowie & songaila 1977 ; fujita 2003 ) .",
    "pressure triggered star formation , in which galactic gas clouds are compressed by the icm pressure , can temporarily increase the star formation rate ( dressler & gunn 1983 ; evrard 1991 ; fujita 1998 ) . + all of the above mechanisms need relatively high density of hot intra - cluster gas , and thus likely to happen in the central region of clusters .",
    "although several authors indicated that these mechanisms can not explain the the suppression of star formation as far as several mpc from the center of a cluster ( balogh et al .",
    "1997 ; kodama et al . 2001 ; lewis et al . 2002 ) , fujita et al .",
    "( 2003 ) pointed out that these mechanisms can happen in cluster sub - clump regions ( small groups around a cluster ) .",
    "the above mechanisms mainly affect the star formation rate of a galaxy , compared with the following dynamical mechanisms which directly affect the morphology of a galaxy .",
    "2 .   galaxy - galaxy gravitational interaction .",
    "this category includes interaction / merging of galaxies ( icke 1985 ; lavery & henry 1988 ; bekki 1998 ) .",
    "mergers between galaxies with compatible masses ( major mergers ) could create an elliptical galaxy ( toomre & toomre 1972 ) .",
    "however , in the semi - analytic simulation , it is known that the observed fraction of intermediate bulge - to - disk ratio galaxies can not be explained solely by major mergers ( okamoto & nagashima 2001 ; diaferio et al .",
    "2001 ; springel et al .",
    "okamoto & nagashima ( 2003 ) indicated that mergers between galaxies with significantly different masses ( minor mergers ) might play an important role in creating intermediate bulge - to - disk ratio galaxies .",
    "galaxy harassment via high speed impulsive encounters also can affect morphology and star formation rate of cluster galaxies ( moore et al .",
    "1996 , 1998 , 1999 ) .",
    "3 .   gravitational interaction between a galaxy and the cluster potential .",
    "+ tidal compression of galactic gas via interaction with the cluster potential can increase the star formation rate of a galaxy ( byrd & valtonen 1990 , valluri 1993 ; fujita 1998 ) .",
    "unfortunately , there exists little evidence demonstrating that any one of these processes is actually responsible for driving galaxy evolution .",
    "most of these processes act over an extended period of time , while observations at a certain redshift can not easily provide the detailed information that is needed to elucidate subtle and complicated processes . to extract useful information in comparison with the observational data , it is of importance to specify the environment where galaxy properties change .",
    "for example , stripping mechanisms ( ram - pressure stripping , strangulation ) and evaporation require dense hot gas , and therefore , can not happen far away from a cluster where gas density is too low .",
    "they can happen only in cluster cores or in dense sub - clumps ( fujita et al . 2003 ) .",
    "merging / interaction is probably difficult to happen in cluster cores since relative velocity of galaxies are too high in such regions in the present universe ( ostriker 1980 ; binney & tremaine 1987 ; mamon 1992 ; makino & hut 1997 ) .",
    "it is also important to investigate the morphology of galaxies which are currently undertaking transformation .",
    "if major merging / interaction is the responsible mechanism , galaxies should have disturbed signature ( e.g. , tidal tails , multiple cores ) in their morphology .",
    "if minor merger is dominant , galactic bulges may become larger and larger during the evolution ( ohama 2003 ) . if stripping or evaporation is more effective , galaxies should be transformed calmly , reducing their luminosity and sizes . in this work ,",
    "we observationally try to clarify these points by examining morphology of galaxies in sections [ chap : md ] and [ chap : ps ] .",
    "the last two sections described various observational and theoretical implications on the evolution of cluster galaxies .",
    "however , almost all observational researches in the literature suffered from the lack of a large , uniform cluster catalog and galaxy catalog . the most commonly used cluster catalog , abell cluster catalog ( abell 1958 , abell , corwin and olowin 1989 ) was constructed by the visual inspection of photographic plates .",
    "although human eyes are an excellent tool to find galaxy clusters , it suffers from subjectivity .",
    "a computer based automated method is needed to create an objective cluster catalog with well understood selection function .",
    "the effects could be more severe for evolutionary study .",
    "for example , butcher & oemler ( 1984 ) used 10 clusters selected from the single color photographic plates to find the spectral evolution of cluster galaxies .",
    "since higher redshift clusters are fainter due to long distance and redshifting of the flux , higher redshift sample could be richer clusters than the nearby sample .",
    "thus it potentially has a malmquist type bias . as another example",
    ", fasano et al . ( 2000 ) found morphological evolution of cluster galaxies , but their cluster sample consist of three different cluster samples observed with three different telescopes ; local clusters of dressler ( 1980 ) , intermittent sample of their own and high redshift sample of dressler ( 1997 ) .",
    "it is necessary to use a large & homogeneous sample of clusters when studying evolution of cluster galaxies .",
    "furthermore , in many studies , the morphological classifications of galaxies have also been performed by human eyes ( dressler et al . 1980,1997 ; fasano et al . 2000 ) , and thus could have been suffered from the subjectivity . by its nature , human based classification change from person to person ( lahav et al .",

    "furthermore , clusters provide a laboratory to study a large number of galaxies at the same redshift and thus assess the effects of dense environments on galaxy evolution , for example , the morphology  density relation ( dressler et al .  1980 , 1984 , 1997 ) , the butcher  oemler effect ( butcher & oemler 1978 , 1984 ) and the density dependence of the luminosity function of galaxies ( garilli et al .",

    "therefore , to obtain robust constraints on @xmath22 and @xmath57 , we need large samples of clusters that span a large range in redshift and mass as well as possessing a well  determined selection function ( see nichol 2001 ) .    despite their importance , existing catalogs of clusters are limited in both their size and quality .",
    "for example , the abell catalog of rich clusters ( abell 1958 ) , and its southern extension ( abell , corwin and olowin 1989 ) , are still some of the most commonly used catalogs in astronomical research even though they were constructed by visual inspection of photographic plates .",

    "( 1961 - 1968 ) was similarly constructed by visual inspection .",
    "although the human eye can be efficient in detecting galaxy clusters , it suffers from subjectivity and incompleteness . for cosmological studies ,",
    "the major disadvantage of visually constructed catalogs is the difficulty to quantify selection bias and thus , the selection function .",
    "furthermore , the response of photographic plates is not uniform .",
    "plate - to - plate sensitivity variations can disturb the uniformity of the catalog . to overcome these problems ,",
    "several cluster catalogs have been constructed using automated detection methods on ccd imaging data .",

    ", we use a special enhancement method to galaxies within the cut in order to enhance the signal to noise ratio of clusters further . among galaxies within a certain color cut ( or color - color cut )",
    ", we find all pairs of galaxies within five arcmin ; this scale corresponds to the size of a galaxy cluster at @xmath60.3 .",

    "we empirically investigated several separations and found 5 to be the best . using the angular distance and color difference of each pair of galaxies ,",
    "we distribute a gaussian cloud representing the density of galaxies on the center position of each pair .",

    "the volume of a gaussian cloud is given by its weight ( @xmath85 ) , which is calculated as follows :      where @xmath87 is an angular separation between the two galaxies and @xmath88(@xmath70 ) is their color difference .",
    "small softening parameters are empirically determined and added in the denominator of each term to avoid the weight becoming infinite .",

    "gaussian clouds are distributed to each 30@xmath3030  cell on the sky .",
    "the 30  cells are much smaller than sizes of galaxy clusters ( several arcmins even at @xmath60.5 ) .",
    "an enhanced density map is obtained by summing up the gaussian clouds for every pair of galaxies within 5. the lower panels in figure [ fig : beforecut_rxj ] and [ fig : beforecut_comparison ] present such enhanced density maps of the region in their upper panels .",
    "rxj0256.5 + 0006 is successfully enhanced in figure [ fig : beforecut_rxj ] .",
    "figure [ fig : beforecut_comparison ] illustrates how the ce method finds galaxy clusters in a larger region .",
    "the advantage of this enhancement method in addition to the color cuts is that it makes full use of color similarity of cluster galaxies .",
    "the color cuts are used to reduce foreground and background galaxies and to enhance the signal of clusters .",
    "since the color - magnitude relation of cluster galaxies is frequently tighter than the width of our color cuts , the use of the second term in equation ( [ equation ] ) - the inverse square of the color difference - further enhances the signal of cluster , in spite of the larger width of the color cuts .",
    "another notable feature is that the enhancement method is adaptive , that is , large separation pairs have a large gaussian and small separation pairs have a sharp , small gaussian .",
    "in this way , the enhancement method naturally fit to any region with any number density of galaxies in the sky .",
    "therefore , it is also easy to apply it to data from another telescope with different depth and different galaxy density .",
    "another benefit of the enhancement method is that it includes a smoothing scheme . and",
    "thus , conventional detection methods commonly used in astronomical community can be used to detect clusters in the enhanced density map .",
    "the enhancement method uses an angular separation in the computation of @xmath85-values",
    ". this might bias our catalog against nearby clusters ( @xmath550.1 ) , which have a large angular extent ( and thus are given less @xmath85 ) .",
    "however , these nearby clusters are few in the sdss commissioning data due to the small amount of the volume probed in the nearby universe .",
    "in addition , these nearby clusters will also be well sampled in the sdss spectroscopic survey with fiber redshifts , and will thus be detected in the sdss 3d cluster selection .",
    "( the ce cluster detection method is intended to detect clusters using imaging data ) .",
    "these nearby clusters do not have a significant effect on angular or redshift - space correlations because the number of such clusters is a small fraction of any large volume - limited sample .",
    "we use sourceextractor ( bertin et al .",
    "1996 ) to detect clusters from the enhanced density map discussed in section[sec : enhance ] .",
    "sourceextractor identifies high density peaks above a given threshold measuring the background and its fluctuation locally .",
    "the threshold selection determines the number of clusters obtained .",
    "a high threshold selects only rich clusters .",
    "we tried several thresholds , examining the colored image , color - magnitude and color - color diagrams of the resulting cluster catalog .",
    "the effect of changing threshold is summarized in table [ tab : sigma_test ] .",
    "the numbers of clusters detected are not very sensitive to the threshold . based on the above",
    ", we have selected the threshold to be six times the background fluctuation , it is the threshold which yields a large number of clusters while the spurious detection rate is still low .",
    "monte carlo simulations are sometimes used to decide the optimal threshold , where most true clusters are recovered while the spurious detection rate is still low .",
    "however , the simulations reflect an ideal situation , and they are inevitably different from true data ; for example , a uniform background can not represent the true galaxy distribution with its large scale structure .",
    "there are always clusters which do not match the radial profile or luminosity function assumed in monte carlo simulations and this may affect the optimization of the threshold .",
    "the optimal threshold in monte carlo simulation differs from the optimal threshold in the real data .",
    "therefore , we select the threshold empirically using the actual data and later derive the selection function using monte carlo simulation .    at high redshifts ( @xmath890.4 ) ,",
    "the number of galaxies within the color cuts is small ; therefore the rms of the enhanced density map is generally too low and the clusters detected at high redshift have unusually high signal . to avoid such spurious detections",
    ", we applied another threshold at maximum absolute flux of 1000 in the enhanced density map .",
    "spurious detections with high signal would generally have low values of this parameter because they are not true density peaks .",
    "the threshold of maximum absolute flux of 1000 can thus reject spurious detections .",
    "the value is determined by investigating the image , color - magnitude and color - color diagrams of the detected clusters and iterating the detection with different values of the maximum absolute flux threshold .",
    "the effect of changing the absolute flux threshold is summarized in table [ tab : fluxmax ] .    to secure the detection further , at all redshifts , we demand at least two detections in the 34 cuts .",
    "since the cluster galaxies have similar colors in all @xmath70 , @xmath64 and @xmath74 colors ; real clusters should thus be detected in at least two color cuts .",
    "this requirement significantly reduces spurious detections .",
    "we apply the procedure of cut ( section [ color - cut ] , [ sec : ce_color - color - cut ] ) , enhance ( section [ sec : enhance ] ) and detection ( section [ sec : detection ] ) to all of the 34 color cuts ( 30 color cuts + four color - color cuts ) independently . after creating the 34 cluster lists ,",
    "we merge them into one cluster catalog .",
    "we regard the detections within 1.2 arcmins as one cluster . to avoid two clusters with different redshifts being merged into one cluster due to the chance alignment , we do not merge clusters unless the successive two color cuts in a certain color both detect it .    an alternative way to merge clusters would be to merge only those clusters which are detected in the consistent color cut in all @xmath70 , @xmath64 and @xmath74 colors , using the model of the elliptical galaxy colors .",
    "however , the catalog will be biased against clusters which have different colors than the model ellipticals . in order to minimize the assumptions on cluster properties we treat the three color space , @xmath70 , @xmath64 and @xmath74 , independently .",
    "one of the very important parameters for various scientific researches using a cluster catalog is redshift and richness .",
    "we estimate redshift and richness of each cluster as follows . instead of the richness estimator introduced by abell ( 1958 ) , we count the number of galaxies inside the detected cluster radius which lie in the two magnitude range ( in @xmath65 ) from @xmath90 ( the third brightest galaxy ) to @xmath90 + 2 ( ce richness ) .",
    "the difference from abell s richness is that he used a fixed 1.5 @xmath58mpc as a radius .",
    "here we use the detection radius of the cluster detection algorithm which can be larger or smaller than abell radius , typically slightly smaller than 1.5 @xmath58mpc . since there are a significant variety in a size of real clusters ,",
    "a varying radius can measure more representative cluster richness than a fixed radius .",

    "<S> this `` morphological butcher - oemler effect '' is shown for the first time using an automated galaxy classification , and is direct evidence of @xmath2 cluster galaxy evolution . </S>",
    "<S> cluster galaxies change their morphology from spiral to early - type galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the redshift evolution , we found the slight dependence of blue / spiral fractions on cluster richness , in a sense that richer clusters have smaller fractions of blue / spiral galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> this result has significant implication for the underlying physical mechanism since it is consistent with a theoretical prediction of a ram - pressure stripping model , where richer clusters have more effective ram - pressure .    </S>",
    "<S> while investigating the morphology - density relation in the sdss , we found two characteristic environments where the morphology - density relation abruptly changes . in the sparsest regions ( galaxy density below 2 galaxy mpc@xmath3 or outside of 2 virial radius ) , the morphology - density relations become less notable , suggesting that the responsible physical mechanisms require denser environment . in the intermediate density regions , ( galaxy density between 2 and 6 galaxy mpc@xmath3 or virial radius between 0.3 and 2 ) , s0 fractions increase toward denser regions , whereas late - spiral fractions decrease . considering the median size of s0 galaxies are smaller than that of late - spiral galaxies and star formation rate </S>",
    "<S> radically declines in these regions , the mechanism that gradually reduces star formation might be responsible for morphological changes in these intermediate density regions ( e.g. , ram - pressure stripping , strangulation ) . in the cluster core regions ( above 6 galaxy mpc@xmath3 or inside of 0.3 virial radius ) , </S>",
    "<S> s0 fractions decreases radically and elliptical fractions increase . </S>",
    "<S> this is a contrasting results to that in intermediate regions and it suggests that yet another mechanism is responsible for morphological change in these regions .    finally , we found that passive spiral galaxies preferentially live in cluster infalling regions ( galaxy density 1@xmath42 mpc@xmath3 and 1@xmath410 virial radius ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus the origins of passive spiral galaxies are likely to be cluster related . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of passive spiral galaxies suggest that a physical mechanism that works calmly is preferred to dynamical origins such as major merger / interaction since such a mechanism can destroy spiral arm structures .    considering all the observational results </S>",
