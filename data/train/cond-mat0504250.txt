    "during the last six years it has been experimentally proven that superconducting circuits can serve as quantum mechanical two - level systems , qubits , to be used for quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "besides the experiments with individual qubits , several experiments have been performed so far on two permanently coupled qubits @xcite .",
    "for instance , to observe the coupling of two charge qubits , the qubit islands have been permanently coupled via a capacitor , and the strength of the coupling has been varied by tuning the qubits in and out of resonance with each other ( by varying the gate voltage ) @xcite .    in order to build a functional , scalable quantum computer , a network design is needed that allows coupling of an arbitrarily large number of qubits , with the possibility to switch on and off the coupling by means of external control knobs . in principle , coupling of only nearest neighbor qubits is sufficient to perform a universal set of gates @xcite .",
    "theoretical schemes for variable coupling of charge qubits have been intensely discussed in literature .",
    "couplings via inductive and capacitive elements have been examined as well couplings via linear lc - oscillators and josephson junctions @xcite . a standard approach to achieve a variable coupling is to employ a squid - type geometry either for the qubits @xcite or for the coupling element @xcite , to be able to control the josephson energy by an external magnetic flux . a somewhat different approach has been suggested in @xcite , where the qubits are coupled via another charge qubit thus creating a variable capacitive coupling .",
    "recently , a different way to achieve a variable inductive coupling has been suggested , namely to let the charge - qubit loops intersect and share a coupling josephson junction or squid .",
    "the interaction is then controlled either by varying the magnetic flux in the qubit loops ( or the coupling squid ) @xcite , or by applying bias currents to the coupling josephson junction @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we give a detailed analysis of the qubit network based on the coupling method proposed in @xcite .",
    "the idea of this method is to couple loop - shaped charge qubits by letting the circulating loop currents , which are sensitive to the charge state of the qubit island , interact .",
    "this is done by placing a non - linear oscillator - a large josephson junction - at the intersection of the qubit loops .",
    "such a coupling can be made variable by using the fact that in the absence of an external magnetic field , the persistent currents in the qubit loops are absent ( for symmetric qubits with equal josephson junctions ) .",
    "however , when a dc current bias is applied to a coupling josephson junction the symmetry is broken and currents start to circulate , the magnitude of the currents being dependent on the bias current .",
    "these currents interact with the oscillator , resulting in a variable effective qubit - qubit coupling .",
    "a similar coupling effect can be accomplished by inserting large readout josephson junctions in the qubit loops @xcite . as we show in this paper , applying current to one of the readout junctions",
    "allows one to measure the state of the corresponding qubit without disturbing the other qubits ; however , when two neighboring readout junctions are biased , the qubit - qubit coupling is switched on .",
    "the advantage of the current - biased coupling scheme is that it does not need any local magnetic fields to control the coupling , fields which could create unwanted parasitic long range interactions .",
    "an important feature is the possibility to operate at the qubit charge degeneracy point , where the decoherence effect is minimized @xcite , and where the gate operations are very simple .",
    "this coupling scheme can be also extended to charge - phase qubits which are still less sensitive against decoherence due to flatter band structure @xcite . with this coupling mechanism , neighboring qubits in an arbitrarily long qubit chain can be coupled , and several independent two - qubit gates can be performed simultaneously .",
    "the fundamental entangling two - qubit gate is a control - phase gate , which together with single - qubit gates constitute a universal set of operations .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in section [ s2q ] we explain the principles of the coupling by considering the simplest case of two coupled qubits .",
    "we estimate the maximum coupling strength , evaluate the residual parasitic couplings , and investigate the charge - phase regime for the qubits . in section [ s2qm ]",
    "we add measurement junctions to the qubit circuits and investigate how to use these junctions as read - out devices and the means to create qubit coupling . in section [ snq ]",
    "we generalize the derivation of section [ s2qm ] to a multi - qubit network with an arbitrary number of coupled qubits .",
    "finally , in section [ suse ] , we discuss how to use the network for quantum computing .",
    "control the individual qubits whereas @xmath0 controls the coupling of the two qubits.,width=188 ]    to more clearly explain the principle of the qubit coupling , we first consider the case of two coupled qubits .",
    "the qubits consist of single cooper pair boxes ( scb ) with loop - shaped electrodes .",
    "@xcite . to create coupling between the qubits , a large - capacitance josephson junction ( jj )",
    "is placed at the intersection of the qubit loops , see fig . [ 2qub ] .",
    "the physics of the coupling is the following : as long as no magnetic flux is applied to the qubit loops , and no bias current is sent through the coupling junction , there are no circulating currents in the qubit loops . however ,",
    "when the bias current is switched on , circulating currents start to flow in the clockwise or counterclockwise direction depending on the charge state of the cooper pair box .",
    "these currents displace the coupling junction oscillator and change its ground state energy , leading to an effective qubit - qubit interaction .",
    "the strength of the interaction is proportional to the bias current through the coupling junction . in the idle state , when the bias current is switched off , small phase fluctuations at the coupling junction generate permanent parasitic qubit - qubit coupling .",
    "however , this parasitic coupling can be made small compared to the controllable coupling by choosing the plasma frequency of the coupling junction @xmath1 to be small compared to the josephson energy @xmath2 .",
    "this requirement implies that the junction charging energy @xmath3 must be small , @xmath4 i.e. the coupling junction must be in the phase regime . this is the most essential requirement for the qubit coupling under consideration .",
    "we begin the evaluation of qubit coupling with the derivation of a circuit hamiltonian . to this end , we first write down the lagrangian @xmath5 of the circuit in fig . [ 2qub ] .",
    "the lagrangian consists of the respective lagrangians of the scbs and the coupling jj , @xmath6 assuming the single cooper pair boxes to consist of identical junctions with capacitance @xmath7 and josephson energy @xmath8 , and following the rules described in e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite , we write the corresponding lagrangian on the form , @xmath9 where @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) is the phase difference across the left ( right ) josephson junction of the @xmath12-th scb , and @xmath13 is the gate capacitance .",
    "the lagrangian of the coupling jj includes the electrostatic energy and the josephson energy of the junction , and also the interaction energy of the junction with applied bias current @xmath14 , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the phase difference across the coupling junction .",
    "the flux quantization condition in each of the qubit loops allows the elimination of one of the qubit variables from the lagrangian .",
    "we assume that there is no external magnetic flux in the loops since magnetic flux will not be used to control either the qubits or the qubit interaction , and we also assume that the loop self - inductances are negligible . then the flux quantization equation takes the form , @xmath17 where we introduced new qubit variables , @xmath18 by virtue of relations ( [ phases ] ) , the gate capacitance terms will take the form @xmath19 introducing a capacitive interaction of the scb with the coupling junction . from here on , the upper ( lower ) sign corresponds to the first ( second ) qubit .",
    "similarly , the appearance of the variable @xmath16 in the scb josephson terms introduces an inductive interaction between the scb and the coupling junction .    at this point , we are ready to proceed to the circuit hamiltonian . by introducing the conjugated variables , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , which have the meaning of dimensionless charges ( in the units of cooper pairs ) on the scb and on the coupling jj , respectively , and then applying the legendre transformation , @xmath22 , we get , @xmath23 here @xmath24 is the scb hamiltonian , where @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the total capacitance of the qubit island and @xmath27 is the ( dimensionless ) charge induced on the qubit island by the gate voltage .",
    "the jj hamiltonian is @xmath28 where @xmath29 .",
    "the last term in eq .",
    "( [ hclass ] ) , @xmath30 describes capacitive interaction of the qubits and the jj , and also direct qubit - qubit coupling , induced by the gate capacitance .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ hclass ] ) is quantized by imposing the canonical commutation relations , @xmath31=i\\delta_{jk}$ ] , @xmath32=i$ ] . to incorporate the coulomb blockade effect ,",
    "we take advantage of the periodic scb potential and impose periodic boundary conditions on the wave function with respect to the phase @xmath33 .",
    "this results in charge quantization on the island . keeping the system at low temperature ( @xmath34 ) and",
    "close to the charge degeneracy point @xmath35 , restricts the number of excess charges on the island to zero or one cooper pair . assuming the charge regime , @xmath36 for the scb , and no transitions to the higher charge states to occur during qubit operation , we truncate the scb hilbert space to these two lowest charge states",
    ". then the single qubit hamiltonian reads , @xmath37 while the capacitive interaction ( [ h_int_class ] ) takes the form , @xmath38 the qubits and jj interact both capacitively , eq .",

    "the further analysis is significantly simplified if one assumes the qubit - oscillator interaction to be small , @xmath55 , and the oscillator to be fast on a time scale of qubit evolution , @xmath56 .",
    "in fact , these assumptions are not needed when the qubits are parked at the charge degeneracy point , @xmath57 , because in this case the interaction term commutes with the qubit hamiltonians , and the problem is exactly solvable @xcite .",
    "the assumption on @xmath58 can be relaxed for the two - qubit circuit , however for a multi - qubit network it becomes essential as discussed later .    the imposed constraints together with eq . ( [ ejec ] )",
    "lead to the following chain of inequalities : @xmath59 under these constraints , one can neglect the excitation of the oscillator , which at low temperature will remain in the ground state . this does not significantly differ from the ground state of the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ hosc ] ) .",
    "for instance , the estimate for the amplitude of the first order correction reads , @xmath60 therefore one can average over the oscillator ground state and drop the oscillator energy term , because it does not depend on the qubit state configurations .    summarizing our derivation , after integrating out the oscillator , we arrive at the effective two - qubit hamiltonian , @xmath61 the qubit - qubit coupling term in eq .",
    "( [ heff ] ) has a clear physical meaning : it results from interacting persistent currents in the qubit loops .",
    "indeed , the persistent currents are given in terms of eqs .",
    "( [ lscb])-([hscb ] ) by the relation @xmath62 , or identically , @xmath63 [ current ] in the truncated form , this relation reduces to @xmath64 ( neglecting phase fluctuations over the coupling jj ) , and the coupling term in eq .",
    "( [ heff ] ) can be expressed as an inductive coupling energy of the two persistent currents , @xmath65 , with the josephson inductance of the tilted coupling junction , @xmath66 playing the role of mutual inductance . in the absence of the bias current when the jj potential is not tilted , @xmath67 ,",
    "the persistent currents are not excited and the coupling is switched off . when the bias current is applied , the coupling is switched on , and its strength increases with the bias current because of increasing persistent currents , and also because of decreasing jj inductance .",
    "let us consider the effect of small @xmath42-terms in eq .",
    "( [ h_inew ] ) .",
    "although small , the last term in this equation proportional to @xmath68 leads to an interesting qualitative effect in the qubit coupling , changing its symmetry .",
    "a similar effect is produced by asymmetry of the qubit junctions .",
    "although an ideal qubit should consist of identical josephson junctions , in practice the junction parameters may vary at least within the range of a few percent . in the asymmetric case , the property of the symmetric qubit to have zero persistent current when the bias is turned off is lost .",
    "now a persistent current is spontaneously generated , the direction of which depends on the charge state of the scb .",
    "this affects the symmetry of the controllable qubit coupling .",
    "the most important is the variation of the josephson energy . for an asymmetric qubit , the josephson term in lagrangian , eq .",

    "they can therefore be considered on the same footing and added to the interaction hamiltonian ( [ h2int ] ) , which now takes the form , @xmath73 . \\label{h2int_ass}\\ ] ] the additional terms give rise to a small direct qubit coupling of the @xmath74-type , in addition to the controllable @xmath75-coupling in eq .",
    "( [ heff ] ) , @xmath76 although small , this additional coupling term does not commute with the qubit hamiltonian even at the degeneracy point , which may complicate the gate operation discussed towards the end of this paper .      even in the absence of bias current , and in the symmetric qubits , there exist small circulating currents in the qubit loops because of ground state phase fluctuation in the coupling junction .",
    "these currents interact via the coupling junction , creating a small parasitic coupling of the qubits .",
    "the effect is described by the higher order terms neglected in the previous discussion .",

    "( [ h2int_ass ] ) ) , @xmath78 this term is linear in @xmath48 , and it creates a direct parasitic qubit - qubit coupling via the mechanism discussed in the previous sections , @xmath79 this coupling is smaller than the controllable coupling by a factor @xmath80 .",
    "obviously , the effect of the junction asymmetry also contributes to this kind of residual coupling , and can be included in eq .",
    "( [ hresy ] ) , by making a change , @xmath81 .",
    "another parasitic term is quadratic in @xmath48 , @xmath82 the effect of this interaction is to change the frequency , and hence the ground state energy of oscillator ( [ hosc ] ) , depending on the qubit state configuration .",
    "this squeezing effect creates a direct residual qubit coupling in the lowest order approximation , @xmath83 this coupling is smaller than the controllable interaction in eq .",
    "( [ heff ] ) by a factor , @xmath84 .      because of the limitation on the gate operation time imposed by decoherence , it is desirable that the qubit coupling is as strong as possible . in our case ,",
    "the coupling strength is generally determined by the parameter @xmath58 ; the strength however increases with the applied current bias .",
    "this is reflected by a cosine - factor in the denominator in eq .",
    "( [ heff ] ) , which formally turns to zero at @xmath85 .",
    "this corresponds to the point when the bias current approaches the critical current value for the coupling jj . at this point",
    "the minimum in the tilted josephson potential disappears , and the junction switches to the resistive state , sweeping the qubit phase and thus destroying the qubit .",
    "therefore the ultimate limitation on the coupling strength is imposed by the switching of the coupling jj .",
    "the latter may even occur at smaller applied current because of tunneling through the josephson potential barrier ( macroscopic quantum tunnelling , mqt ) .",
    "the assumption of a small mqt rate imposes an additional limitation on the coupling strength to the one imposed by the constraints ( [ constraints ] ) . indeed ,",
    "because the potential wells of the tilted josephson potential become shallow with decreasing josephson energy , @xmath86 , the constraints must be reconsidered , @xmath87 clearly putting limitations on the maximum allowed tilt .    in order to very roughly estimate an upper bound for the maximum coupling strength , let us soften requirements ( [ constraints2 ] ) , and consider the relations    @xmath88    both the relations can be fulfilled by applying sufficiently large bias current , and by choosing appropriate plasma frequency .",
    "the latter can be adjusted by shunting the coupling jj with a large capacitance .",
    "the corresponding relations read , @xmath89 the coupling strength for a tilted jj is given by the phase - dependent coupling parameter in eq .",

    ". for large applied bias current , the potential well can be approximated with a cubic curve , and the mqt rate is estimated by@xcite @xmath92 suppose that the value @xmath93 gives satisfactory small mqt rate ( @xmath94 according to the following estimates ) . under this condition , which is more restrictive that the right one in eq .",
    "( [ constraints3 ] ) , the relations in eq .",
    "( [ constraints4 ] ) become modified , @xmath95 leading to a somewhat smaller maximum coupling parameter , @xmath96      so far , we have assumed the qubit island to be in the charge regime @xmath97 , where the two lowest charge eigenstates , @xmath98 and @xmath99 , serve as the qubit basis .",
    "however , from an experimental point of view it may be more appealing to work in the charge - phase regime @xmath100 because the qubit becomes more stable against charge noise when the energy bands flatten @xcite . in this regime ,",
    "the qubit states are given by bloch wave functions , consisting of superpositions of many charge states .",
    "nevertheless , as easily seen , the controllable qubit coupling via a current biased large jj will persist also in the charge - phase regime .",
    "indeed , an essential physical characteristic of the qubit - jj interaction is the persistent current in the qubit loop , eq .",
    "( [ current ] ) , @xmath101 .",
    "the magnitude of this current is controlled by the tilt of the jj ( @xmath102 , and it is zero when the jj is idle , regardless of whether the qubit is in the charge or charge - phase regime .",
    "furthermore , an important property of the charge regime is that the qubit - jj interaction is diagonal in the qubit eigenbasis when the qubit is parked at the charge degeneracy point , @xmath35 , i.e. it has @xmath103-symmetry in this eigenbasis .",
    "this property simplifies the 2-qubit gate operations discussed later , and it also allows a quantum non - demolishing measurement of the qubit by means of current detection using the large jj , as discussed in the next section .",
    "we show in this section that this property persists in the charge - phase regime .",
    "namely , we show that the scb hamiltonian truncated to a pair of lowest bloch states commutes with the truncated current operator at @xmath35 .",
    "this leads to direct qubit - qubit coupling of @xmath103-type in the qubit eigenbasis .",

    "indeed , when the josephson energy is tuned to zero , the lower - corner elements of the blocks , marked with @xmath128 , correspond to the lowest energy states of the scb .",
    "in fact , the hadamard transformation ( [ hadamard ] ) corresponds to the rotation to the eigenbasis of a charge qubit at the charge degeneracy point , which coincides with the current eigenbasis . when the josephson energy increases , the eigenstates of the matrix ( [ diagh1 ] ) become superpositions of many charge states , which however does not mix the charge superpositions denoted with indices @xmath129 and @xmath130 , and can be obtained by independent rotations of the matrix blocks .",
    "during these rotations , although the two lower - corner eigenvalues marked with @xmath128 do change , they however remain the lowest energy levels .",
