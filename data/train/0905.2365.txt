    "we address _ kepler _ s observations of `` photometric orbits '' ( phos ) , which is our term for the variable flux of reflected starlight from short - period giant planets ( spgps ) .",
    "we believe that an improved understanding of this enigmatic class of objects will be an important legacy of the _ kepler _ mission .",
    "we have conducted a ministudy of _ kepler _ s expected performance in detecting spgps and in estimating their orbital parameters via the pho .",
    "we have found unexpected scientific benefits .",
    "a `` keplerian data set '' is an observational record governed by the classical motion of two bodies interacting by the force of gravity .",
    "radial - velocity , astrometric , and photometric observations of extrasolar planets are prime examples . in fact , the three types provide overlapping and complementary information , which creates synergism when more than one data type is available , as we can expect in many cases for spgps discovered by _",
    "least for radial velocity and photometry ( including both transits and reflected light ) .",
    "when first discovered in the 1990s , spgps were a surprise , and we still do not understand their basic properties .",
    "why do they exist in such abundance ?",
    "how were they created ?",
    "after creation , did they migrate in distance from the star , and if so , by what mechanism ?",
    "why do the orbits of many spgps have significant eccentricity , if tides should efficiently circularize them ?",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ f1 ] . ) what are the optical radii and actual masses of spgps , and what are their physical conditions ? of what types of stellar and planetary systems are spgps members ?    in the next decade ,",
    "new information from a variety of sources will help address these questions , and we expect that _ kepler _ s observations will be important . _",
    "kepler _ s discoveries will increase the number of known spgps , and its measurements of phos will increase the value of other data sets by independent estimates of some planetary parameters , and will provide some information not otherwise available .    the current _ kepler _ science team plans to search for spgps by seeking peaks in the periodograms ( power spectra ) of stellar light curves and to determine geometric albedos for transiting spgps ( jenkins & doyle 2004 ) .",
    "this paper goes well beyond those modest ambitions .",
    "we analyzed many simulated _ kepler _ data sets to explore how reflected - light observations might provide additional information about spgps .",

    "these monte carlo experiments allow us ( 1 )  to provide a preliminary calibration of the completeness of the periodogram search technique .",
    "such calibration is generally informative and will enable estimates of the true occurrence frequency of spgps as a function of planetary parameters .",
    "a sufficiently strong signal allows us ( 2 )  to provide _ complete solutions _ of the pho .",
    "so far as we can detect , no one else has previously thought this possible .",
    "the benefits of full pho solutions include : ( 1 )  using the estimated orbital inclination to determine the true planetary mass when radial - velocity measurements are available ; ( 2 )  improved albedo estimates for eccentric transiting planets , by allowing data points to be interpreted with their correct planetary phase angles ; ( 3 ) independent estimates of the four orbital parameters in common with radial velocity ; and ( 4 )  possible estimates of the planetary phase function in very high signal - to - noise cases .",
    "pho observations may be difficult .",
    "there is uncertainty about how low the albedos of spgps actually are , about their phase functions , and about a possible noise floor due to systematic errors from instrumental and stellar sources .",
    "nevertheless , simple detection of spgps in reflected light should be robust in the regime of _ kepler _ photometry , and estimates of all six orbital parameters may be feasible in at least a subset of cases .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , a theory of the pho does not exist in the literature , and so we provide a summary account .",

    "in addition , we recognize an opportunity to calibrate the periodogram in terms of search completeness , which will enable the estimation of the underlying spgp population .",

    "therefore , any direct variation  or lack of variation  of _ psphc _ with respect to another parameter is seen best in the frame of the paramagram it shares with @xmath12 .",

    "the streak of degraded _",

    "second , it provides a scientific metric to inform trades during mission development , and to optimize variable aspects of the observations in the operational period .",

    "rather than @xmath67 , _ kepler _ will actually measure the _ sum _ of the planetary and stellar fluxes , which means subtracting an estimate of the stellar flux from the observation , and then dividing , in order to approach @xmath67 .    to complicate matters",

    "the pedestal of signal on which the variable part of the planetary light curve stands  is indistinguishable from steady starlight .",
    "currently , we think the proper way to address this issue is to use the _ zero - mean _ planetary signal , @xmath67@xmath99 , when comparing theory and observation in the process of seeking solutions of the pho . in the ministudy , we assumed that @xmath100  ppm applies to measurements of @xmath67@xmath99 , and that the photometric errors are normally distributed .",

'' _ chisqr _ is a numerical function with two sets of arguments , the solution and the observational data : @xmath102 \\equiv   \\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{1}{n-6 } \\left(\\frac{\\left(h\\left[t_k\\right ] - < \\!\\!h\\!\\!>\\right ) - \\left(\\hat{h}_{k}\\ , - < \\!\\!\\hat{h}\\!\\!>\\right)}{\\sigma}\\right)^2~~\\ ] ]    if a global minimum of _ chisqr _ can be discovered , its coordinates are the `` solution''the best estimate of the pho parameters .",
    "more generally , surfaces of constant merit in parameter space divide more probable solutions from less probable , which is the principle that defines confidence regions . if the noise in a keplerian data set is understood , it may be possible to associate absolute levels of probability with such surfaces and regions . in particular ,",
    "if the measurement errors are normally distributed , and if we assume the keplerian theory is correctly applied , then the probability that the true solution is contained within a surface of constant merit can be computed or looked up in a table : it is the cumulative probability of the theoretical @xmath103 statistic .",
    "to explore the scientific utility of estimating the six pho parameters from _ kepler _ data sets , we investigated the expected errors in the fitted parameters @xmath104 .",

    "lowering @xmath132 reduces theoretical values for @xmath135 , which must be compensated by larger theoretical values of @xmath3 .",
    "furthermore , eq .  1 suggests that the increase in @xmath3 should be proportional to the change in the square root of the effective phase integral , @xmath136 $ ] , where @xmath137 \\equiv \\int^\\pi_0 \\sin\\beta\\ , \\phi[\\xi,\\beta]\\ , q[\\beta]\\ , d\\beta~~,\\ ] ] where @xmath138 $ ] is the probability distribution of the phase angle ( @xmath138 $ ] is different for each orbit ) .",

    "14 shows the fractional deviation of @xmath143\\sqrt{i[\\xi_1]/i[\\xi_2]}$ ] from @xmath145 $ ] .",
    "this correction indicates a basic understanding of the dominant factor in the phase - function issue in regards to @xmath3 .",
    "figure  [ f16 ] shows the systematic errors due to the phase function for the other five orbital parameters in the case of the jupiter body - twin data set .",
    "the semimajor axis @xmath10 is not affected , because it is controlled by the periodicity of the signal .",
    "the systematic errors in @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath14 are somewhat larger than the typical random errors of similar phos ( see figs .",
    "[ old - f5][old - f7 ] . for the inclination angle , @xmath16 , which is perhaps the most important pho parameter ,",
    "the systematic error is _ smaller _ than the typical random errors : @xmath1462% compared with typically @xmath14710% ( see fig .",
    "[ old - f8 ] ) .    for a real data set , a practical approach would be simply to fit the data using the best guess as to phase function , and to qualify the result with that choice . because the phase function itself can only be estimated from data with much higher @xmath98 than afforded by _ kepler _",
    ", we will need to be content for now with estimates of @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath132 , and @xmath3 that depend on the assumed phase function .",
    "the most complete treatment will specify an _ a  priori _ probability distribution for the phase function ( i.e. , for the phase - function parameter @xmath132 ) , in which case the combined error for each orbital parameter could be expressed as the convolution of the probability distributions of systematic and random errors .    because of the somewhat smaller systematic error in inclination angle @xmath16 as compared to its random errors , our prediction that _",
    "kepler_-level photometry may break the @xmath0 degeneracy in a useful manner is not substantially undermined by the phase - function issue .",
    "we have defined and put forward an approach to investigating the pho , which we believe will come to be recognized as a keplerian entity on a par with radial - velocity and astrometric orbits .",
    "the pho solves in principle one of the outstanding problems in astronomy : the @xmath0 degeneracy in radial - velocity observations .",
    "the way is now open to computing true masses for radial - velocity companions , starting with spgps .",
    "brown ( 2009 ) shows for large , noisy keplerian data sets  particularly in the case of astrometry , but radial velocity and photometry are all basically the same in this regard  that search completeness via periodogram , as well as the completeness of accurate estimates of orbital parameters by least squares , are solely functions of the signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "@xmath98 is defined as the semi - amplitude of the signal times the square root of the number of data points , divided by the single - measurement error .",
    "for example , 50% search completeness calls for @xmath1488 , due to any combination of signal amplitude , number of data points , and single - measurement error ( so long as the orbit is well covered by the measurements ) .",
    "( the color scale above the abscissa in figure  4 shows @xmath149 for the pho . ) high completeness for , say , @xmath150% accuracy in estimates of orbital parameters typically calls for @xmath15160 . in the case of the jupiter body - twin data",
    "set shown in figure  [ old - f10 ] and treated in  8 , @xmath152 .",
    "therefore , detection is guaranteed for this planet for the assumed _ kepler _ performance and observing parameters .",
    "furthermore , the high @xmath98 of the jupiter body - twin data set means that the small deviations of the fitted orbital parameters from the true values ( eq .  25 ) are no surprise .",
    "pho observations may be difficult .",
    "there is uncertainty about how low the albedos of spgps actually are , about their phase functions , and about a possible noise floor due to systematic errors from instrumental and stellar sources .",
    "nevertheless , simple detection of spgps in reflected light should be robust in the regime of _ kepler _ photometry , and estimates of all six orbital parameters may be feasible in at least a subset of cases .",
    "burrows et  al .",
    "( 2008 ) offers the most recent discussion of observed and theoretical values of geometric albedo @xmath5 for the case of spgps .",
    "the best measured value , upper limit @xmath153 of rowe et  al .  ( 2008 ) , from _ most _ observations of hd  209458b , is compatible with cloudless models .",
    "the same models suggest an that @xmath5 could increase by factor two at the somewhat longer wavelengths sampled by _",
    "kepler_. meanwhile , transit photometry of spgps has revealed astonishingly large radii1.74 @xmath154 in the case of tres-4 ( mandushev et  al .",
    "a planet with the size of tres-4 and twice the geometric albedo of hd  209458b would offer @xmath155 .",
    "if that planet were on the orbit of the jupiter body - twin , the signal - to - noise ratio would be @xmath156 .",
    "as expected for any new method , particularly one debuted with such epochal claims as breaking the @xmath0 degeneracy , our treatment of the pho will certainly attract questions and concerns , which we must study and address",
    ". we would be the first to caution about systematic effects , particularly about a noise floor that might limit the averaging out of random measurement errors . nevertheless , the potential payoff of determining the inclination angles of radial - velocity companions independently  that alone  is so great that we must press forward .",
    "whatever its current technical limitations , we can expect the grasp of this new method to improve with time , as instrumentation improves and systematic errors are addressed .",
    "a key issue is how well our method stands up to more realistic noise , particularly due to stellar and planetary variability .",
    "the latter must wait for _ kepler _ results and the possibility that observations may discover variations in planetary properties .",
    "the former , however , is a known issue , which we must study using more realistic random deviates for the photometry . that research will likely produce selection criteria for the future target lists .",
    "we expect that a meaningful subset of _ kepler _ targets will support pho modeling .",
    "this expectation is supported by the prediction of jenkins & doyle ( 2003 ) that _ kepler _ will discover `` from 100 to @xmath147760 spgps '' in reflected light by periodogram searching .",
    "all these spgps are potential candidates for pho analysis .",
    "it has been asked how our simple model and six - parameter solutions relate to the apparent complexities of the _ forward problem _ , that is , predicting photometric properties from detailed planetary models ( seager et  al .",

    "unless the signal - to - noise ratio of _ kepler _ data sets is much higher than we expect , we predict satisfactory @xmath157 probabilities for fits using only six parameters , which would say that additional parameters are not required by the observations . for systematic effects with assumed values that are not constrained by the observations ,",
