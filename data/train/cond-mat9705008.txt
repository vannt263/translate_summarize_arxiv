    "below we further reduce the number of open parameters by assuming the scattering lengths @xmath52 and @xmath53 to be equal .      if we now examine the state in equilibrium of the system , we find that the requirement of equal scattering lengths implies that the condensates must have equal widths @xmath54 .",

    "this analysis will be carried out in the following subsection .      to obtain the frequencies of small amplitude oscillations around the equilibrium positions we linearize the full equations ( [ dot ] ) around the equilibrium points , @xmath58 .",
    "we find the following four frequencies :    [ modes ] @xmath59    which can be interpreted as collective oscillations depicted in fig .  1 .",
    "the modes @xmath60 and @xmath61 are two fold degenerate , corresponding to oscillation e.g. in the @xmath62-plane and the @xmath63-plane @xcite .",

    "oscillations of particles in state @xmath66 are visualized by solid line arrows , oscillations of particles in state @xmath67 by dashed line arrows .",
    "the order in which these motions appear with increasing energy depends strongly on the values of the scattering lengths involved . in fig .",
    "2 we display the spectrum for a positive value of @xmath52 . for large , negative values of @xmath68 ,",
    "the two modes with the lowest energies are those with the maximum spatial overlap , namely mode @xmath69 and mode @xmath70 .",
    "if we now consider the region where @xmath68 is positive and large , we naturally find that the modes @xmath71 and @xmath72 , for which the spatial overlap is minimized , are the lowest energy modes .",
    "the point at which this crossing happens changes with changing values of @xmath52 .",
    "again we find , as in @xcite , that the widths of the condensates remain finite up to the point of collapse .",
    "spectrum of the low lying excitation frequencies for a fixed , positive value @xmath73 . with @xmath74 increasing from negative values to positive ones",
    "the two low lying modes and the two high lying ones get exchanged .    the eigenfrequencies ( [ modes ] )",
    "provide the stability region of the equilibrium points ( [ eom_eq ] ) ,    @xmath75    since for @xmath76 we recover the single component results @xcite where only particles in one state are present , we see that for positive values of @xmath68 the region of stability increases and for negative ones it decreases .",
    "this is due to contributions to the total system energy from either the repulsive or attractive interaction .",
    "however , this effect is non - linear due to the nature of this interaction .",
    "it is illustrated in fig .",
    "phase diagram for the stability of the two - condensate system for @xmath77 particles . for positive @xmath68 the region of stability",
    "is increased due to the positive energy contribution from the repulsive interaction .",
    "however , it does not expand linearly with increasing @xmath68 .",
    "let us now consider the case of two spatially displaced traps and work out the differences to the above situation .",
    "we assume a displacement in the @xmath9-direction and make an ansatz analogous to eqs.([wf ] ) and ( [ nlse ] ) where one condensate is centered at @xmath78 and the second at @xmath79 .",
    "also in this case we assume that the number of particles is conserved , what implies that the imaginary parts of the coupling constants are again zero .",
    "we apply the moment method as in the previous case and arrive , since the spatial symmetry is now broken in the @xmath9-direction , at the following set of equations of motion for the widths of the two condensates in the @xmath9-direction , @xmath80 , and in the @xmath43- and @xmath42-directions , @xmath81    [ dteom ] @xmath82    again one gets the equations for @xmath83 and @xmath50 by simply exchanging the indices .",
    "we can also like , in the non - displaced case , find a potential of the form of eq.([potential ] ) , which is suitable for the derivation of these equations .",
    "however , in this case the term originating from the interaction of the particles in the different states is multiplied by an additional factor , @xmath84 $ ] , which ensures that the influence of these interactions gets weaker , the more the condensates are displaced .",
    "this then implies an even smaller region of spatial overlap .",
    "note that the widths of the condensates are included in this factor and it therefore has a non - negligible effect on the physics of the system in addition to weakening the magnitude of effects found in the non - displaced case .",
    "+ let us start calculating the equilibrium states for this case from eqs.([dteom ] ) . in fig .",
    "4 we plotted the widths @xmath85 and @xmath86 of the condensates for @xmath52 and @xmath68 positive and equal .",
    "once the condensates are separated by a distance @xmath87 the repulsive interaction between particles from different states becomes an effectively attractive one ( and v.v . ) , as can be seen from the fact that the width on the @xmath9-direction gets smaller then the width in the @xmath43- and @xmath42-direction .",
    "the explanation for this effect is , that the direction of the repulsive force with respect to the surfaces of the condensates changes in these regions where they do no longer overlap . at large distances",
    "when the interaction between the particles in different states becomes negligible again , the case of two independent , isotropic condensates is recovered again .",
    "width of the condensates in the @xmath9-direction and in the @xmath43-,@xmath42-directions for @xmath88 and @xmath89 . due to the repulsive interaction between particles from different states ,",
    "the condensate gets squeezed in the @xmath9-direction at a certain distance and then expands once the region of overlap diminishes further .",
    "looking at the excitation spectrum of the two component system by analyzing it again via a linear expansion around the equilibrium points , we find , as can be seen from fig .  5 , that the degeneracies existing in the non - displaced case get lifted with increasing distance . bringing the condensates that far from each other that they can be considered as two independent condensates @xcite the spectrum reduces again to two three - fold degenerate values , since the condensates become again isotropic .",
    "spectrum of the low lying excitation energies for @xmath90 .",
    "the degeneracies are lifted with increasing @xmath91 and for @xmath92 it reduces to the case of two , isotropic , single condenstates again .    in this gaussian - ansatz",
    "we can again easily interpret these modes to be of the following types : @xmath93 the members of these vectors represent the oscillation - amplitude in the directions @xmath94 , where @xmath95 depends on the parameters of the system .",
    "the lifting of the degeneracies is mainly due to the fact , that the spatial displaced system is not invariant under an exchange of the variables @xmath96 and @xmath97 and not of @xmath98 and @xmath99 , as can be seen from eqs .",
    "( [ dteom ] ) .",
    "let us now look at the stability of the stationary states , which we again retrieve from the analysis of the hessian matrix .",
    "as can be seen from fig .",
    "6 the further the condensates separate from each other , the weaker the effect of additional stabilization ( destabilization ) becomes , since it results from the repulsive ( attractive ) interaction between the condensates . for @xmath100",
    "one recovers the stability condition for the case of two separate condensates .",
    "stability region for displaced traps with a displacement parameter @xmath91 .",
    "for far displaced traps the result for independent condensates is recovered .",
    "we used a moment method to describe the behavior of two overlapping bose - einstein - condensates in different internal states , assuming that the shapes of the individual wave functions do not deviate too much from a gaussian - shape . with this method",
    "it is straightforward to derive equations of motion for the open parameters defining the exact form of the gaussian function , especially the width of the condensates .",
    "they can for the general cases easily treated numerically and for special cases even analytical solutions are possible .    for the case of isotropic traps and isotropic condensates we did calculate the equilibrium points for the system and analyzed their stability .",
    "we found , that in comparison to the case of one pure condensate the region of stability can be extended ( shrinked ) if the interaction energy between particles in different states is positive ( negative ) . due to the nonlinear character of the interaction also",
    "this effect is of nonlinear nature .",
    "it appears strongest for non - displaced traps and gets weaker the more the centers of the two traps are apart from each other .",
    "we were also able to calculate the energies of the first excited states and interpret the collective motions .",
    "for the case of displaced traps the degeneracies existing in the non - displaced case get lifted .",
