    "there are several reasons for considering additional @xmath4 symmetries and their associated extra @xmath5 bosons .",
    "such additional @xmath4 s arise after the breaking of gut s ( for example @xmath6-based rank-5 models ) , or in string compactifications .",
    "in addition to justifying the underlying model , more importantly , additional @xmath4 s would also solve the mssm @xmath3 problem when broken around the weak scale .",
    "indeed , as was already argued in @xcite , in a large class of string models , breaking scale of the extra @xmath4 s come out to be below a @xmath7 .",
    "the phenomenologically viable models should satisfy two conditions at the string scale : firstly , the extra @xmath4 should be non - anomalous and should not acquire a mass from the string or hidden sector dynamics ; namely , its mass must come from the gauge symmetry breaking in the observable sector .",
    "secondly , all scalar soft mass - squareds must be positive and of similar magnitude .",
    "the latter holds in gravity - mediated susy breaking scheme , where the mass scale is given by the gravitino mass , not necessarily , so however , in gauge - mediated susy breaking schemes .",
    "soft terms , parametrizing our ignorance of the origin of the susy breaking , can be obtained from a general supergravity ( sugra ) lagrangian in @xmath8 limit @xcite .",
    "although , the minimal sugra predicts universal soft terms , in general sugra theories ( see @xcite and references therein ) , and in superstring theories @xcite it is possible to have non - universal soft terms .",
    "thus , considering such explicit examples , one is free to consider non - universal boundary conditions @xcite , without referring to the particular case of universality .    for testing such extra @xmath4 models in near - future machines ,",
    "the tree - level potential is clearly not sufficient ; one has to take into account the radiative corrections to have a meaningful model at these energies . among other methods @xcite , the effective potential approach proved to be an elegant and simple way of icorporating the radiative corrections to the scalar potential @xcite , which we will adopt in this work as well .",
    "this work is organized as foollows : in sec .",
    "2 we shall first describe the model at the sugra scale . using one loop rge s we shall obtain all the low energy potential parameters as functions of their sugra scale values . after discussing the requirements on the low energy potential for phenomenological viablility , we determine the appropriate sugra scale parameter space .",
    "we do this with minimal amount of non - universality .",
    "that is , we allow for non - universality only between higgs doublets and remaining scalars ; in particular , we choose doublet soft mass - squareds to be equal and one order of magnitude smaller than the others .    in sec .",
    "3 we consider the issue of radiative corrections . out of all fields which can contribute to the effective potential , we consider top quark and stops contributions , and neglect the remaining fields .",
    "we assume that the log effects which are accounted for in solving the rge s , are enough to take into account the effects of higgs , neutralino , chargino , and vector boson loops , at least for calculating the low - lying mass spectrum @xcite .    in sec .",
    "4 we work out the one - loop potential numerically , and graph the tree- and one - loop results together to enable a comparative discussion of the effects of the radiative corrections .    in sec .",
    "5 we discuss the results of the work in the light of near - future accelerators , and mssm and nmssm predictions .",
    "as is well known , the fundamental sugra scale @xmath9 is approximately one order of magnitude larger than the mssm coupling constant unification level @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "however , the threshold effects @xcite can close the gap , and thus , in the following we shall choose the mssm unification scale @xmath11 as the starting point of the analysis at which the initial conditions of the potential parameters are specified .",
    "we reconsider a general , anomaly - free , abelian extended susy model which was discussed in @xcite already .",
    "the model is specified by an abelian extension of the mssm gauge group : @xmath12 with the couplings @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "the particle content for one family is given by the left - handed chiral superfields : @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "the higgs sector contains the @xmath22 doublets @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and the sm - singlet @xmath25 .",
    "the superpotential for the model is given by @xmath26 where the family mixings are ignored .",
    "we kept only the top and higgs yukawa couplings , as the yukawa coupings of the other fermions are much smaller.the existence of @xmath27 group makes the model totally different from nmssm by forbidding an elementary @xmath3 term and an @xmath28 term ( so that the superpotential does not have a @xmath29 symmetry ) .    without specializing to a particular class of string compactifications ,",
    "we parameterize the supersymmetry breaking by considering the most general soft supersymmetry breaking terms : @xmath30 here @xmath31 are gauginos with the masses @xmath32 , and @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the scalar components of @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "the superscript nought on each quantity designates its value at the sugra scale which is determined by the vev s of the hidden sector fields ( moduli and dilaton fields , in the case of string compactifications ) , modulo the threshold corrections .",
    "the scalar components of the higgs superfields are assigned the following representation under @xmath22 group : @xmath37 adding to @xmath38 the usual f - term and d - terms of the associated group factors , one obtains the full scalar potential , whose higgs part reads @xmath39 the terms involving parameters @xmath40 come from the supersymmetric part of the lagrangian consisting of @xmath41 and @xmath42 terms , and their explicit expressions are listed below : @xmath43 where @xmath44 . as there is no experimental constraint on @xmath27 group",
    ", @xmath16 is arbitrary .",
    "however , for realistic models it is expected that @xmath45 @xcite , so we assume the unification of @xmath46 with the other gauge couplings at the the mssm unification scale @xmath11 @xcite . using the trace formulas for the fermion sector @xmath47=tr[q_{isospin}^{2}]=2\\,,\\ ,   tr[y^{2}]=\\frac{10}{3}\\,,\\,\\nonumber\\\\",
    "tr[y'^{2}]= 6{q'}_{q}^{2}+3({q'}_{u}^{2}+{q'}_{d}^{2})+   2{q'}_{l}^{2}+{q'}_{e}^{2 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we normalize the gauge couplings such that , at @xmath11 , they satisfy @xmath48 with the normalized @xmath49 and @xmath27 couplings , @xmath50    in obtaining the renormalization group flow of the parameters of the potential we shall consider one - loop rge s which were listed in appendix a of @xcite .",
    "we assume that the scale of susy breaking is around the weak scale , and thus we integrate rge s of a softly broken susy model from the sugra scale down to the weak scale directly . among the rge",
    "s the most complicated ones are those involving yukawa couplings @xmath51 and @xmath52 which obey coupled nonlinear equations .",
    "the top yukawa coupling @xmath52 reaches its fixed point value of @xmath53 almost independently of the initial conditions @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "corresponding to this @xmath51 takes values around @xmath56 . on the other hand , the rge s of soft masses , being linear ,",
    "can be solved exactly as a function of their initial conditions , for given @xmath54 and @xmath55 . finally , as a by - product of the coupling constant unification , it is natural to assume a common mass @xmath57 for all gauginos at the sugra scale .",
    "in constructing the solutions of rge s one needs to specify the @xmath27 charges of the fields . without referring to specific @xmath6 based charge assignments , one can relate different @xmath27 charges to each other by imposing the cancellation of the triangular anomalies together with the gauge invariance of the potential .",
    "the superpotential in ( 1 ) includes only the top and higgs trilinear mass terms , and thus we shall require the gauge invariance for these vertices only , leaving other the would - be vertices ( such as @xmath58 ) unconstrained .",
    "then the solution of @xmath27 charges reads @xmath59 which fix all but the two ( @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) of the @xmath27 charges .",
    "the advantageous side of this solution set is that it leaves the @xmath27 charges of higgs doublets free , which will be important in analyzing the mixing angle of @xmath5 boson and @xmath27 gauge boson .",
    "we give this solution for the third family , and assume vanishing @xmath27 charges for the first two families .",
    "this is allowed in non - geometrical string compactifications ( such as free - fermionic models ) , where a given higgs doublet couples only one family @xcite . as will be discussed later on , third family coupling of @xmath27",
    "is important in analyzing the @xmath2 models with lep constraints .",
    "finally , for future use , we make the choice @xmath62 in ( 9 ) which fix all of the @xmath27 charges .",
    "then , the solution of rge s , with the initial values @xmath63 for yukawa couplings , read as follows : @xmath64 as a result of the normalization of the gauge couplings the low energy parameters are not very sensitive to the assignmets of the @xmath27 charges .",
    "for example , if one chooses a model with @xmath6 charge assignments , the results are affected only by a few percents .",
    "thus , from a practical point of view , one can regard the above - listed solutions as independent of @xmath27 charge assignments . on the contrary ,",
    "dependence of the low energy parameters , especially the triliear couplings , on the variations of the initial conditions of yukawa couplings is important . in what follows",
    "we shall confine ourselves to @xmath63 @xcite , as was already used in obtaining ( 10 ) .",
    "the low energy potential with the parameters in ( 10 ) is a general one , and thus one has to specify the appropriate region of the parameter space to satisfy the phenomenological requirements existing at the weak scale .",
    "after the breaking of gauge symmetry down to @xmath65 , there will arise two neutral massive gauge bosons @xmath5 and @xmath2 whose mass matrix reads @xmath66 where @xmath67 and , higgs vev s are defined as @xmath68    there are three main conditions that the vacuum state must satisfy :    * the @xmath69 boson mass must remain at its lep1 value , as the model is exteded only in the neutral direction , * the color and charge symmetries must remain unbroken , * the @xmath1 mixing angle @xmath70 must be below @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath73 as otherwise the lepi value of @xmath74 is destructed .",
    "the first condition can be satisfied using the fact that the potential ( 4 ) has a common mass scale defined by the gravitino mass , as the soft susy breaking terms in ( 2 ) are generated by the sugra breaking .",
    "thus , the mass scale of the potential , @xmath75 ( proportional to the gravitino mass ) , can be factored out and remaining dimensionless potential can be minimized freely . the first condition above",
    "can then be met by imposing the constraint @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the dimensionless @xmath79 and @xmath80 vev s , which are defined as @xmath81 , and for future use @xmath82 .",
    "the charge breaking can arise from both higgs and squark sectors . in the higgs sector , with the help of @xmath22 symmetry , a possible @xmath83 can be rotated away , and the charge breaking can be parametrised in terms of @xmath84 . as can be calculated easily , the potential prefers the charge preserving minimum , if @xmath85 , where @xmath86 @xmath87 , and @xmath88 is the charged higgs boson mass - squared .",
    "consequently , in what follows we shall work in that portion of the parameter space where the charged higgs boson has real mass , so that the charge breaking in the higgs sector is avoided .",
    "when , at least one of @xmath89 , @xmath90 , take a nonzero value , both color and charge symmetries are broken .",
    "to prevent the formation of such a minimum , one has to have a certain hierarcy between the top trilinear coupling @xmath91 and the soft squark mass parameters .",
    "in fact , the usual criterium @xcite @xmath92 must hold at a scale @xmath93 .",
    "more importantly , when the squark masses go negative , a charge and/or color breaking minimum will be developed , even if it is secondary .",
    "when analyzing the low energy potential , we shall always keep these conditions in mind .    that the @xmath1 mixing angle is to be small",
    "is a severe constraint on the vacuum state .",
    "the @xmath1 mixing angle , @xmath70 , is generated by the off - diagonal elements of the @xmath1 mass matrix ( 10 ) , and given by @xmath94    there are mainly three regions of parameter space of the pure higgs sector yielding a small @xmath70 :    1 .",
    "@xmath95 @xmath2 @xmath96 as is seen from ( 18 ) , when @xmath97 , @xmath70 becomes small .",
    "this occurs in that portion of the parameter space satisfying , @xmath98 for which higgs vev s behave like @xmath99 this ordering of the vev s make @xmath100 small compared to @xmath101 , whereby producing a small mixing angle .",
    "this mechanism does not require any relationship among the soft masses @xmath102 and @xmath103 , and charges @xmath60 and @xmath61 ; it utilizes only the ordering in ( 19 ) .",
    "@xmath0 , however , is closely related to the values of charges @xmath60 , @xmath61 and the values of the soft masses @xmath102 and @xmath103 . when @xmath104 takes higher and higher values , only @xmath27",
    "gets broken , and other group factors remain unbroken .",
    "this introduces a mass scale @xmath105 between weak and sugra scales ; remnants of the gauge group must be broken by a second stage around the weak scale . before the occurance of such an intermediate scale ,",
    "large @xmath104 can create a relatively large @xmath3 parameter , thus @xmath104 getting large values must be avoided .",
    "2 .   @xmath106 @xmath2 @xmath96 as ( 18 ) suggests , another way of obtaining a small mixing angle would be to make @xmath100 small irrespective of the value of @xmath107 . to obtain this kind of cancellation",
    ", one needs roughly @xmath108 which may be satisfied in some limited portion of the parameter space .",
    "however , unlike mssm and like nmssm , the existence of the trilinear coupling parameter @xmath109 opens a new avenue in obtaining an appropriate electroweak breaking .",
    "that is , when @xmath110 holds , all vev s are drawn approximately to the same point : @xmath111",
    "if the @xmath27 charges of higgs doublets satisfy @xmath112 , this large trilinear coupling - induced minimum cancels @xmath1 mixing , allowing @xmath74 to be compatible with lepi data .",
    "such a light @xmath2 must show up in the @xmath5-pole observables , and therefore parameters of the model can be constrained using lep1 data . as a side remark ,",
    "the passage of the trilinear coupling from lower values to higher ones ( compared to the soft masses ) is either a first order or second order phase transition , depending on the sign of @xmath113 .",
    "in fact , if @xmath114 is positive , there is a first order phase transition occuring at the critical point @xmath115 .",
    "@xmath116 @xmath96 one can obtain a phenomenologically viable minimum in all aspects by combining the parameter spaces of @xmath95 @xmath2 @xmath117 and @xmath106 @xmath2 @xmath117 .",
    "to do this , one can choose both @xmath104 and @xmath118 large compared to other soft masses .",
    "as large @xmath118 pushes all higgs vev s to the same point , and @xmath104 prefers a large sm - singlet vev , when both @xmath104 and @xmath118 are large , doublet vev s ( controlled by @xmath119 via ( 22 ) ) will approach to approximately the same value , and sm - singlet vev ( controlled by @xmath104 via ( 20 ) ) will be much larger than them .",
    "thus , this portion of the parameter space yields a small mixing angle together with a relatively heavy @xmath2 . in the analyses below , we shall be mainly interested in this kind of parameter space and assume @xmath120 .",
    "actually , when @xmath104 is large , one does not need this condition , as @xmath100 in ( 14 ) is already small compared to @xmath101 .",
    "however , this kind of choice allows for the realization of the required minimum in a reasonable range of parameter values .    in the above-",
    "mentioned low- energy analysis we have required a certain hierarchy among the potential parameters .",
    "however , as dictated by the solution of rge s in ( 10 ) , it is not realistic to consider such idealized cases since as one parameter changes , all others do too as a function of the initial conditions .",
    "moreover , we need not only the higgs sector parameters , bu also the parameters of the squark sector as we shall calculate the 1-loop squark contributions to the higgs potential .",
    "thus , one has to determine the sugra scale parameter space consistently by considering all the low energy parameters simultaneously .",
    "once non - universality is permitted , one faces with a huge parameter space each point of which corresponds to some symmetry breaking scheme at low energies .",
    "the usual procedure for the determination of the appropriate portion of the parameter space , would be to trace the sugra - scale parmeter space point - by - point , and pick up those yielding a viable minimum at low energies .",
    "however , with the low energy parameters in ( 10 ) , and the constraints implied by the @xmath116 @xmath117 , we can determine the appropriate parameter space analytically .",
    "in accordance with the conditions coming from the @xmath116 @xmath121 , we want to speed up @xmath104 and @xmath119 compared to other mass parameters in terms of their dependence on a choosen sugra scale parameter . these two have three parameters , @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath57 , in common , and we shall use @xmath122 as a probe for determining the appropriate parameter space , by fixing other parameters with minimal amount of non - universality @xcite . to slow down the @xmath122 dependence of @xmath102 and @xmath103",
    ", we make the following choice for @xmath124 and @xmath125 : @xmath126 for the remaining parameters we keep universality : @xmath127 and finally we let @xmath128 . under these conditions ,",
    "the low energy parameters read as follows : @xmath129 as we see from these equations the quadratic @xmath130 dependence of @xmath102 and @xmath103 are supressed compared to those of the others with @xmath131 being the fastest one among all concerning their @xmath130 dependence . in the analysis below",
    "we shall vary @xmath132 in a certain range of values , and determine @xmath123 from the invariance of the @xmath133 mass under such abelian extensions of mssm .",
    "when @xmath134 is small , except for @xmath103 , all soft masses are positive , yielding a non - zero @xmath78 and vanishing @xmath77 , @xmath78 .",
    "this is not an acceptable minimum , as the gauge symmetry is not broken completely . as @xmath134 increases",
    ", @xmath103 starts overcoming the large negative threshold coming from ( essentially the @xmath135 ) gaugino masses , and @xmath136 and @xmath137 do develop nonzero vev s .",
    "but still it may not yield a small enough mixing angle .",
    "further increase of @xmath134 brings us to the sought minimum where @xmath138 .",
    "however , this increase can not be maintained further as the squark masses turn to negative after overcoming their large positive mass thresholds dominated by the @xmath135 gaugino .",
    "negative squark masses cause charge and color breaking minima , even if secondary , so that this limiting case will be avoided below .",
    "until now our discussion has been based solely on the rge - improved tree - level potential . however , quantum corrections beyond the log effects included in the rge analysis are important .",
    "especially the top - stop sector gives the most important contribution due to the relatively large value of top yukawa coupling .",
    "to take such radiative corrections into account we shall follow efective potential approach @xcite in which the radiatively corrected one - loop potential is given by @xmath139 where the one - loop contribution has the coleman - weinberg form @xmath140 where @xmath141 is the usual supertrace and @xmath142 is the field dependent mass - squared matrix .",
    "we have transferred a renormalization scheme dependent constant into a redefinition of the renormalization scale @xmath143 .",
    "one notes that all the parameters in ( 27 ) are to be evaluated at the scale @xmath144 .",
    "indeed , this is consistent with the rge analysis of the last section as we have integrated them from the sugra scale down to the weak scale . in the loop expression ( 28 ) we consider only the contributions of top and stops @xmath145 , @xmath146 whose masses are given by @xmath147 where @xmath148 and the dimensionless coefficients @xmath149 follow from the colored sector of the full scalar potential .",
    "we shall calculate radiative corrections to the lightest cp - even higgs mass bound , so we are interested in the cp - even scalar mass - squared matrix which can be obtained by evaluating @xmath150 at the vev s , in the basis ( @xmath151 , re[h_{1}^{0 } ] , re[s^{0}]$ ] ) .    before going into a detailed numerical analysis",
    ", we first present a general discussion on the effects of the radiative corrections based on some approximate formulae .",
    "the top - stop splitting @xmath152 and stop splitting @xmath153 describe the most important contributions of the one - loop corrections . on the other hand , due to the choice of @xmath143 ,",
    "the remaining log @xmath154 is not as important as the former ones . to extract some information about the effects of the loop corrections on the tree level parameters",
    ", one can expand the minimization equations in powers of stop splitting and identify the renormalization effects on the tree - level quantities .",
    "in fact , to lowest order in stop splitting @xmath155 , and neglecting the terms involving the gauge couplings , one finds that the most important contributions come to @xmath119 , @xmath103 and @xmath156 ; which are given by @xmath157\\\\ \\hat{\\lambda}_{2}&=&\\lambda_{2}+\\beta_{h_{t}}s_{t\\tilde{t}}h_{t}^{2}\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath158 , and @xmath159 .",
    "let us now discuss the implications of these one - loop corrections in the light of the rge solution set in ( 25 ) .",
    "as the first equation in ( 32 ) shows , @xmath119 is strengthened by the loop corrections .",
    "however , @xmath122 dependence of @xmath91 is approximately one order of magnitude smaller than that of @xmath119 so that one does not have a significant improvment for @xmath119 , unless top - stop splitting is large .",
    "the improvement in @xmath103 , @xmath160 depends , in addition to @xmath161 itself , on how large @xmath162 is compared to unity .",
    "that is , if the stop masses are large compared to @xmath163 , the top - stop splitting can be large enough to give a significant contribution to @xmath103 .",
    "hence , both @xmath119 and @xmath103 get significantly improved if the top - stop splitting is large enough . as one can read off from ( 25 ) , for small @xmath134 , the squark soft masses are large due to the contribution of the @xmath135 gaugino .",
    "therefore , @xmath103 is significantly improved by the loop corrections in this range of the @xmath134 values .",
    "however , we observe from ( 25 ) that for larger @xmath134 values @xmath161 gets smaller and the loop contributions drop significantly .",
    "finally , as dictated by ( 32 ) , @xmath80 quartic coupling @xmath156 is significantly improved by the radiative corrections if the top - stop splitting is large enough . in the small @xmath134 limit",
    ", one has @xmath164 , which clearly shows that tree - level @xmath78 is larger than the loop - level one .",
    "this radiative reduction in @xmath78 causes one - loop @xmath0 to drop : @xmath165 } { a_{s}\\mu_{s}})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the effective mssm @xmath3 parameter @xmath166 is introduced .",
    "indeed , with the contributions of @xmath167 and @xmath168 , one - loop @xmath0 is reduced compared to the tree - level one .",
    "however , the inverse @xmath169 dependence will force the loop contribution to drop rapidly after some @xmath134 values . in this sense ,",
    "one expects tree- and loop - level @xmath0 s be close to each other in the large @xmath134 regime .    at the tree - level , for small @xmath134 ,",
    "one expects a relatively large mixing angle as the expected cancellation in @xmath100 does not occur . at the loop - level , however , due to the reduced @xmath0 one expects a smaller @xmath1 mixing angle as can be seen from the form of @xmath100 in ( 14 ) .",
    "altough in the large @xmath134 limit radiative correction to @xmath0 is diminished , due to the increase in @xmath170 ( @xmath104 increases ) the loop - level @xmath1 mixing angle will be still smaller than the tree - level one .",
    "the lightest cp - even higgs mass has the tree - level bound of @xmath171\\ ; . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the first term is the mssm tree level bound , the @xmath172 term is the nmssm contribution ( @xmath173 case ) , and finally the last term is the d - term contribution of @xmath27 group . using the same approximations that had lead us to ( 32 ) , a straightforward calculation yields the following one - loop bound : @xmath174\\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as we observe from this equation , one - loop bound is always larger than the tree - level one .",
    "since @xmath122 dependence of @xmath91 is weak , the main contribution to the bound comes from @xmath163 and @xmath175 terms , and it is maximized either by top - stop splitting contribution , or by the @xmath175 contribution .",
    "in fact , due to this @xmath175 dependence it will be much larger in @xmath95 @xmath2 @xmath117 than in @xmath106 @xmath2 @xmath117 . in the parameter space",
    "we shall trace one expects the one - loop bound be dominated by @xmath163 and @xmath175 terms in the small and large @xmath134 regimes , respectively .",
    "had we included the entire particle spectrum and worked to all orders our results would be @xmath143 independent .",
    "the one - loop expressions for @xmath176 and @xmath167 in ( 32 ) are actually @xmath143 dependent and their dependence can be recovered by letting @xmath177 .",
    "therefore , if for some choice of @xmath143 , @xmath178 happens to be important , one can analyze these two quantities by intoducing the splitting function @xmath179 .",
    "similarly , in the expression for @xmath0 , except for @xmath180 term , one can make the replacement @xmath181 to take into account its @xmath143 dependence .",
    "unlike these , @xmath168 in ( 32 ) , and lightest higgs mass bound in ( 35 ) are independent of @xmath143 , so they exhibit the same behaviour for all @xmath143 . in general , all scalar mass - squared matrices are @xmath143 dependent , but the lightest cp - even higgs mass bound turns out to be scale independent . in the rge analysis assumed that the scale of the susy breaking @xmath182 is around the weak scale , so the choice of @xmath183 is necessary for consistency of the analysis .",
    "thus , we do not expect the @xmath143 dependence of the parameters to change the above - mentioned predictions significantly .    until now we have based our analysis on the approximate formulae which were obtained by assuming that the top - stop splitting , @xmath154 , and all gauge couping dependent terms are negligably small .",
    "these assumptions do not necessarily hold in the entire @xmath134 spectrum , and thus it is needed to have a detailed picture for the @xmath134 dependence of all these quantities .",
    "in this section we shall investigate the effects of the radiative corrections on various quantities by an exact treatment of the problem using numerical techniques . to obtain the scalar mass matrices one has to calculate",
    "@xmath184 evaluated at the vev s . during the minimization we shall rescale all fields and parameters of mass dimension by @xmath123 ; consequently the parameters of the potential depend on a single quantity , @xmath134 defined in ( 26 ) . after minimizing the dimensionless potential",
    ", we recover the physical shell by requiring @xmath185 where @xmath186 is the fermi scale .",
    "as we have already discussed in obtaining ( 16 ) , this rescaling procedure works very well for the tree level potential @xcite due to the uniqueness of the mass scale .",
    "however , radiative corrections do necessarily introduce an additional mass scale @xmath143 .",
    "thus , the rescaling invariance of the tree - level potential does not hold at the loop level . using ( 36 )",
    ", one would rescale the basic log in ( 28 ) as @xmath187 which clearly requires the knowledge of @xmath123 which itself is something we aim to find .",
    "the determination of @xmath123 thus requires a consistency analysis where one inserts a trial value in this rescaled log , and compare it with the resulting one after the minimization .",
    "this procedure goes on until trial and output values for @xmath123 do match .",
    "we have done this numerically , and the result is shown in fig.1 as a function of @xmath134 .    in the analysis below we shall present tree - level and one - loop quantities on the same graph for the sake of easy comparison . in each graph",
    "the free variable is @xmath134 , the ratio of higgs trilinear coupling to top trilinear coupling at the sugra level .",
    "the starting value of @xmath134 is chosen to be that one for which none of the vev s vanish .",
    "on the other hand , the maximum of @xmath134 is determined by its threshold value at which @xmath188 turns to negative due to large @xmath170 values .",
    "this threshold shows up before squark soft masses turn to negative ; so there is no danger of charge and/or color breaking in the range of @xmath134 values we shall consider below .",
    "fig.1 shows the @xmath134 dependence of @xmath123 for tree- and loop - level analyses . while tree - level @xmath123 peaks around @xmath189 with a value @xmath190 , one - loop @xmath123 peaks around @xmath191 hitting the value of @xmath192 .",
    "as the vev s leave the small @xmath134 regime ( or @xmath78 dominated regime ) , the sum @xmath193 approach its minimum , as @xmath77 and @xmath78 are driven to close enough values by @xmath119 . that @xmath123 will be maximized around these @xmath134 values follows from ( 36 ) . after passing by this maximization point ,",
    "all of the mass parameters become proportional to the associated power of @xmath134 , as dictated by ( 25 ) . hence , in this large @xmath134 regime , we expect dimensionless doublet vev s be approximately proportional to @xmath134 because of which we observe an approximate @xmath194 fall off in fig.1 .",
    "this kind of behaviour in @xmath123 reflects itself in all the relevant masses we shall discuss below . in solving the rge s we have used the prescription @xmath128 , which implies the weak scale masses of @xmath195 , @xmath196 , @xmath197 , and @xmath198 for @xmath135 , @xmath22 , @xmath49 , and @xmath27 gauginos , respectively .",
    "thus , depending on the present and future experimental limits on the gaugino masses of different group factors , one can restrict @xmath134 to a certain range of values , keeping in mind that the choice @xmath128 itself is not necessarily unique .",
    "we plot the @xmath134 dependence of @xmath0 in fig .",
    "2 . as we observe from this figure , for small @xmath134 values , loop contributions do really push @xmath0 to smaller values . again in agreement with our expectations , for large @xmath134 , both the tree level and loop results come closer rapidly , and gradually approach to unity . the difference between one - loop and tree - level @xmath0",
    "s fall below @xmath199 after @xmath200 .    in fig.3",
    "we present the @xmath134 dependence of the @xmath1 mixing angle @xmath70 . in agreement with the predictions of the last section , one - loop mixing angle",
    "is smaller than the tree level one everywhere . as we see from this figure , the phenomenological bound of @xmath201 @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath202 @xmath203 after @xmath204 is comfortably satisfied after @xmath204 .",
    "the last point about this figure is that for large @xmath134 values one - loop and tree - level results remain approximately parallel , indicating the fact that both doublet vev s reach their limiting values controlled by @xmath119 , and sm - singlet vev enter the @xmath104 dominated regime .",
    "another important quantity , @xmath205 , is shown in fig .",
    "4 as a function of @xmath134 .",
    "first , we see that loop corrections generally increase the @xmath206 mass in the entire @xmath134 range . both tree - level and one - loop masses increase until @xmath207 in accordance with @xmath123 in fig.1 .",
    "likewise , in parallel with the behaviour of @xmath123 @xmath205 decreases gradually after @xmath207 , and is expected to saturate after some point due to the fact that @xmath134 dependence of @xmath123 and dimensionless sm - singlet vev are almost inversely proportional to each other in this range of @xmath134 values .",
    "the one - loop @xmath205 peaks at @xmath208 by taking the value of @xmath209 ; thus , it can not increase indefinitely with @xmath134 .",
    "as expected , the tree - level @xmath205 , in similarity with the tree - level @xmath123 , peaks at @xmath207 , with a value @xmath210 .",
    "the values taken by @xmath205 depends crucially on the value of @xmath16 . under the normalization in ( 8) , and the @xmath27 charge assignments in ( 9 ) , the solution of the rge s yield @xmath211 at the weak scale",
    "this ratio would push the value of @xmath205 above @xmath212 , if @xmath213 were the case .",
    "one notes that the recent tevatron result @xcite giving @xmath214 would be well satisfied if @xmath16 were equal to @xmath15 .    as explained in the introduction ,",
    "one of the basic aims of constructing such extended models is of course the dynamical formation of the mssm @xmath3 parameter .",
    "the effective @xmath3 parameter in the present model has the @xmath134 dependence shown in fig . 5 , for which we have almost the same behaviour observed in @xmath206 mass , as both are controlled by @xmath123 .",
    "the one - loop @xmath175 peaks around @xmath215 , and takes the value @xmath216 at this point .",
    "similarly , the tree level @xmath175 peaks around @xmath217 with a value @xmath218 .    finally , in fig .",
    "6 , we present the @xmath134 dependence of the lightest higgs mass bound , @xmath219 , which is seen to satisfy the predictions of the last section . as we see from ( 34 ) , the tree level bound depends solely on the doublet vev s , so that after reaching the @xmath220 regime the bound is maximized and saturated at @xmath221 . in the same way until leaving the small @xmath134 region , one - loop bound also increases and hits the value @xmath222 in the far end of the total @xmath134 range . the fact that one - loop bound saturates much later than the tree - level",
    "one is due to the @xmath175 dependence of the radiative corrections .",
    "in this work we have investigated one - loop contributions to certain low - energy quantities in the framework of the effective potential approach , using an rge - improved radiatively corrected scalar potential , following from the superpotential in ( 1 ) .",
    "however , derivation of the entire low - energy particle spectrum ( such as top , bottom , and @xmath223 masses ) requires the study of a more general superpotential involving , in addition to the superpotential in ( 1 ) , exotics predicted in most string models and non - renormalizable quartic mass terms from which light fermion masses follow @xcite .",
    "here we have restricted ourselves mainly to the study of certain low - energy quantities determined by the higgs sector of the model , for which the typical superpotential in ( 1 ) should suffice @xcite .    among the low - energy quantities",
    "we have worked out , @xmath2 boson and lightest higgs mass bound are of phenomenological importance .",
    "the search for @xmath2 @xcite will be one of the goals of the next generation accelerators . in near future",
    ", lep ii will be searching for @xmath2 boson in leptonic and @xmath224 channels . besides this , lhc will search for @xmath2 boson with quark - antiquark fusion processes . in general , the exclusion limits of @xmath2 mass and its couplings depend on the model and collider parameters @xcite .",
    "the @xmath27 charges of the present model are generation dependent , and thus , the constraints on its @xmath2 boson is weaker than that of the generation independent ones .",
    "the @xmath1 mixing angle ( see fig .",
    "3 ) is small enough to supress the effects of @xmath2 fermion couplings in the @xmath5 -pole observables @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 mass in the present model has an upper bound of @xmath225 , and satisfies the presently existing phenomenological bounds .",
    "the lightest higgs mass bound turns out to be @xmath226 @xcite in mssm . in nmssm , however , it is @xmath227 @xcite . in the present model",
    ", it turns out to be @xmath228 .",
    "the bounds of the present model and mssm practically coincide , however , the bound in the present model is expected to increase slightly if the nnl corrections are taken into account @xcite . in near future , the lightest higgs boson will be discovered at lep ii if @xmath229 , and at fnal in @xmath230 after accumulating an integrated limunosity of 25 - 30 @xmath231 @xcite .    in conclusion , we have analyzed the efects of the radiative corrections on the various low energy quantities in the present model by taking the contributions of top and stops into account . as we have shown graphically ,",
    "the one - loop improvment in the low energy parameters are no way negligable .",
    "moreover , the one - loop corrections support the satisfaction of the phenomenological requirements compared to the bare tree - level potential .",
    "the findings of the work will be tested in the near - future colliders .",
    "one of us ( d. a. d. ) thanks paul langacker for his helpful remarks at the earliest stages of this work ."
