    "consider a stable set @xmath214 in @xmath182 . by choosing @xmath215 when @xmath216 or @xmath217 otherwise we obtain an induced stable set in @xmath210 of size @xmath218 .",
    "conversely , let @xmath219 be a stable set in @xmath210 .",
    "modify @xmath219 such that for each @xmath220 not both @xmath221 and @xmath222 are in @xmath219 : if both are in @xmath219 , then the stable set @xmath223 has the same cardinality and only includes one of @xmath208 .",
    "then we can obtain a stable set in @xmath182 of size at most @xmath224 .",
    "in particular , a stable set of size @xmath203 ( resp . , @xmath204 ) in @xmath182 translates into a stable set of size @xmath225 ( resp . , @xmath226 ) in @xmath210 .",
    "now let @xmath45 be constructed as follows : starting from the line graph of @xmath210 , for each @xmath220 add two vertices and connect them as to obtain the graph @xmath227 depicted in figure  [ fig : edge_dual ] .",
    "the number of vertices in @xmath45 is @xmath228 and the number of edges is @xmath229 , as every vertex belonging to the line graph of @xmath210 has degree four and the two additional vertices in each @xmath227 have degree two .    as @xmath210 is triangle - free , there is a one - to - one correspondence between triangles in @xmath45 and vertices in @xmath210 .",
    "moreover , two vertices in @xmath210 are adjacent if and only if their corresponding triangles in @xmath45 have a common vertex .",
    "thus a maximum stable set of size @xmath230 ( resp . ,",
    "@xmath226 ) in @xmath210 translates into a maximum number of @xmath230 ( resp .",
    ", @xmath226 ) vertex - disjoint triangles in @xmath45 .",
    "it is known that finding the maximum number of vertex - disjoint triangles in a graph is apx - hard  @xcite . however , no explicit lower bound was known .",
    "it is np - hard to approximate the maximum number of vertex - disjoint triangles in a graph with a factor of @xmath231 for arbitrarily small constant @xmath95 .",
    "the result holds even for graphs with maximum degree four .",
    "now , consider ocpin @xmath45 , _ i.e. _ , finding the maximum number of vertex - disjoint odd cycles .",
    "we prove that there is always an optimal solution consisting of triangles only .",
    "assume the contrary , _",
    "i.e. _ , the optimal solution includes a cycle @xmath184 of length at least @xmath232 .",
    "we distinguish three cases .",
    "+ first , @xmath184 does not contain any vertex other than those of type @xmath145 and @xmath233 ( see figure  [ fig : edge_dual ] ) .",
    "then , @xmath184 must be a triangle .",
    "second , @xmath184 is fully contained in some @xmath227 .",
    "one easily checks that also in this case @xmath184 must be a triangle .",
    "third , @xmath184 is not contained in any @xmath227 .",
    "then @xmath184 has to pass through the node @xmath234 of some @xmath227 and hence the solution does not include any triangle in such @xmath227 .",
    "substitute @xmath184 by any of the two triangles in @xmath227 to obtain another optimal solution to ocp .",
    "hence there is an optimal solution to ocpin @xmath45 only containing triangles .",
    "therefore we have the following hardness result .",
    "consider the node - edge incidence matrix @xmath18 of @xmath45 : this is a @xmath235 matrix .",
    "from what was argued above , the maximum number of vertex - disjoint odd cycles of @xmath230 ( resp . , @xmath226 ) translates into subdeterminants of size @xmath236 ( resp . , @xmath237 ) .",
    "this allows us to prove a hardness of @xmath238 when the dimension is @xmath239 .",
    "it is np - hard to approximate msdwith a factor of @xmath240 for arbitrarily small constant @xmath95 .",
    "the hardness even holds when restricted to node - edge incidence matrices of graphs with maximum degree four .    due to the above construction of @xmath45 , it is np - hard to distinguish between the case when @xmath241 and @xmath242 for arbitrarily small constant @xmath95 .",
    "hence , for msdon @xmath18 we obtain a gap of @xmath243 where @xmath244 and @xmath245 .",
    "we show that , if we were able to solve mvson @xmath0 vectors in @xmath1 with an approximation factor @xmath246 , then we would be able to solve msdwith input @xmath22 with an approximation factor of @xmath247 .",
    "can be replaced by @xmath54 . as this is not crucial for our proof",
    ", we leave the details to the interested reader . ]",
    "as we proved that msdis inapproximable up to a factor @xmath5 for some constant @xmath4 unless @xmath6 , we conclude an inapproximability for msdof @xmath248 for any @xmath249 , unless @xmath6 .    without loss of generality ,",
    "let @xmath250 be an optimal solution to msd .",
    "consider the mvsinstance with input @xmath251 , and let @xmath214 be the simplex output by the algorithm .",
    "note that @xmath252 is a feasible solution to mvs , hence @xmath253 . now consider the triangulation of @xmath254 into simplices @xmath255 containing the origin and @xmath54 of the vertices of @xmath214 .",
    "we obtain @xmath256 where @xmath219 is the simplex among @xmath255 of maximum volume .",
    "note moreover that the submatrix @xmath257 associated to the non - zero vertices of @xmath219 is a feasible solution to the original msdproblem .",
    "we deduce @xmath258 hence , we can output @xmath257 and obtain the required approximation .",
    "we remark that the construction of @xmath210 and @xmath45 in section [ sec : ss - to - ocp ] can be improved .",
    "in fact , we do not need to subdivide _ every _ edge of @xmath182 twice .",
    "it is sufficient to subdivide edges so that for every vertex of @xmath182 , two of its incident edges are subdivided twice .",
    "hence , we can leave a maximum matching of @xmath182 untouched .",
    "since we can compute a maximum matching in @xmath182 in polynomial time and every 3-regular graph of @xmath259 vertices has a matching of size @xmath260  @xcite , we obtain the following slight improvements :          if the number of columns is linear in the number of rows , then a better approximation result than that of theorem  [ thr:2 ] is possible for mvsand msd .",
    "the next theorem is a consequence of a recent result of despande and rademacher  @xcite .",
    "these authors have shown how to randomly sample from the set of bases of a given matrix @xmath18 such that the probability of sampling a particular basis @xmath26 is proportional to @xmath263 .",
    "in fact , their algorithm is more general as it can also handle @xmath186-subsets of linearly independent columns .",
    "assume now that @xmath264 with some @xmath265 .",
    "then the number of bases @xmath266 is bounded by @xmath267 .",
    "we deduce @xmath268 the claimed result then follows by repeated sampling and picking the largest basis .",
    "an alternative proof of this assertion relies on the fact that a random point in the zonotope @xmath272 can be efficiently sampled  @xcite .",
    "it is folklore that a zonotope can be partitioned into parallelepipeds generated by the bases of @xmath18 , _",
    "i.e. _ , each parallelipiped can be mapped one - to - one to a basis .",
    "we can then identify the parallelepiped where the sampled point resides .",
    "this results in sampling each basis with a probability proportional to its determinant .",
    "we then obtain an estimation of @xmath273 , as required .",
