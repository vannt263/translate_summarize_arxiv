    "in this section we present a simple approach which allows to estimate the contribution of the dipole - dipole interaction ( ddi ) . here",
    "we made the estimation of the ddi contribution for two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems , but in general this approach can be easily generalized also for three - dimensional case .",
    "the general form for the energy of dipole - dipole interaction for atomistic models is    @xmath43    where @xmath44 is the absolute value of the magnetic moment in units of bohr magneton , @xmath45 are the distances between moments @xmath10 and @xmath46 in units of the lattice constant @xmath47 , @xmath48 are the unit vectors in the direction of @xmath49 .",
    "let consider 2d square lattice of spins in the plane of @xmath50 and infinite in @xmath51- and @xmath52-directions .",
    "the highest energy of ddi in this case corresponds to @xmath53 and the ddi energy per lattice site is @xmath54    the sum in ( [ ddi2 ] ) excludes the position of the lattice site @xmath55 ( denoted by @xmath56 ) and can be calculated explicitly @xcite @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the values of dirichlet beta and riemann zeta functions for @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "thereby , the maximum energy of ddi per one lattice site of infinite 2d square lattice of mn / w(001 ) with @xmath61 ev / t and @xmath62   is    @xmath63    note , value in [ ddifin ] is the upper bound limit of ddi while the lower bound limit has negative sign , it depends on the relative orientation of the spin .",
    "thereby , the energy of ddi per mn atom for mn / w(001 ) system is @xmath64    when upper / lower bound limit of ddi is one or two order of magnitude lower than the coupling constants of other energy terms in the system , one may neglect with the contribution of ddi .",
    "compare to the contribution of ddi , for pairwise interactions one has to take into account the number of neighbors in particular shell .",
    "similar to the above approach , one can also estimate the contribution of dipole - dipole coupling between mn and underlying co layers .",
    "the energy contribution of the mn - co interlayer ddi per one mn spin can be written as @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the magnetostatic field generated by the co layer , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 is the distance between mn and co layers . under the assumption that co layer is homogeneously magnetized @xmath70 ( we assume @xmath71 ev / t ) and mn atoms are situated exactly on top of the co lattice sites , the field @xmath66 in ( [ eid ] ) can be calculated numericaly with a high precision@xcite @xmath72 thereby , the energies of dipole - dipole interaction per lattice site of mn atom , @xmath73 ev / t @xmath74 where the sign of energy contribution depends on the sign of @xmath75 of mn atom with respect to @xmath66 .",
    "the field @xmath66 decays exponentially with the distance @xmath76 and in this particular case for @xmath77 the dipole - dipole coupling between the mn and co layers can be neglected .",

    "nevertheless , due to the large number of energy terms as well as interacting shells , the calculation of the total energy is extremely time consuming . to increase the efficiency of the calculations we use massively parallel computation within graphic processing unit instead of central processing unit , allowed by recently developed cuda technology . after optimizing the mc algorithm used with cuda - fortran ( extension of standard fortran language for gpu programming )",

    "<S> chiral magnetic skyrmions are localized magnetic vortices with particle like properties . </S>",

    "<S> the dmi is the result of spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) that occurs in magnetic systems with broken inversion symmetry . </S>",

    "<S> the latter class of materials seems very promising , because they are most compatible to device technology and varying the thickness of the layers and the composition at the interface allow to tune the intrinsic parameters such as exchange , dmi , magnetic anisotropy _ etc . _  in a wide range @xcite .    of particular interests </S>",

    "<S> this brings into play ultrathin layers of chiral magnets with non - micromagnetically describable magnetic behavior due to competing ferro- and antiferromagnetically coupled exchange interactions between different atomic sites that are finally the origin of stable achiral exchange spin - spirals ( ss ) of atomic length scale . in this case , the role of the dmi is to select a particular chirality of spirals . from micromagnetic </S>",

    "<S> we show that ultrathin films of chiral magnets with exchange driven ss posses the same properties as conventional chiral magnets , but the energy scale translates into gigantic magnetic fields that are not accessible in the laboratory , and thus those type of magnets had been excluded so far . </S>",
    "<S> a prototype system for this type of magnets is a monolayer ( ml ) of mn on a w(001 ) substrate with an experimentally confirmed  @xcite atomic - scale chiral exchange stabilized ss , but no skyrmions could be found .        in this letter , we propose the interlayer exchange coupling ( iec ) @xcite as an elegant approach to stabilize skyrmions without external field and thus widen the class of chiral magnets hosting skyrmions . </S>",

    "<S> contrary to the skl which may appear as a metastable state at zero magnetic field , the isk at low field exhibits an elliptical instability at @xmath24 and does not exist for fields below @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the isk shows remarkable size variations in strong contrast to the small changes in the period length of the skl . </S>",
