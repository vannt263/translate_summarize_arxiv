    "as glass - forming liquids enter the supercooled state , relaxation processes gradually but dramatically slow down , and at the same time they become non - exponential  .",
    "one possible way of understanding this behavior would be to think of the relaxation function @xmath4 as the sum of a large number of exponentially decaying contributions , each with different relaxation times ; with each contribution corresponding to a particular region in the system  @xcite .",
    "this is one aspect of the picture of _ dynamical heterogeneity _ , in which mesoscopic regions relax differently from each other and from the bulk  . in this framework",
    ", it is assumed that the differences between regions are not frozen in but dynamical , _",
    "i.e. _ as the system evolves , the local relaxation times @xmath0 evolve , so that `` fast '' regions become `` slow '' , and viceversa .",
    "this same picture has also been invoked to explain other phenomena occuring in the same regime , such as the breakdown of the stokes - einstein relation between the diffusion coefficient and the shear viscosity .",
    "direct evidence for dynamical heterogeneity has been found in particle tracking experiments in glassy colloidal systems  @xcite and granular systems  @xcite , and in numerical simulations  @xcite .",
    "the origin of dynamical heterogeneity is still uncertain , although some explanations have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "one of the proposed explanations is that dynamical heterogeneity emerges as a consequence of dynamical constraints , which produce non trivial structure in the space of ( space - time ) particle trajectories  @xcite .",
    "another proposal is that as a liquid is supercooled it eventually undergoes a random first order transition in which the liquid freezes into a mosaic of aperiodic crystals  @xcite , which give rise to the heterogeneity that is observed .",
    "a third approach postulates that dynamical heterogeneity emerges from the presence of soft ( goldstone ) modes associated with a broken continuous symmetry under time reparametrizations @xmath5  @xcite .    a quantitative description of dynamical heterogeneity in terms of the presence of locally fluctuating relaxation times @xmath0 has in principle some strong advantages .",
    "one of them is its simplicity and intuitive appeal .",
    "another one is that the basic quantities that appear in this description are intrinsically instantaneous , as opposed to other common descriptions for which the basic quantities describe changes in the system over a finite time interval , which complicates their interpretation . despite those advantages , however , such a description has proved elusive .",
    "for example , even the question of experimentally determining the relationship between the lifetime @xmath6 of regions of heterogeneous dynamics and the bulk @xmath7-relaxation time @xmath8 has proved controversial , with some results indicating that @xmath9 , and other results indicating that @xmath10  @xcite .    in the present work , our goal is twofold . on one hand ,",
    "we establish a connection between the presence of time reparametrization fluctuations and the presence of fluctuating local relaxation times @xmath0 . on the other hand",
    ", we introduce a new method to extract the actual values of those relaxation times @xmath0 from experimental or numerical data , and test this method on data from numerical simulations .",

    "at temperatures close to the calorimetric glass transition temperature @xmath11 , the dynamics of glass forming liquids is dramatically different from the high temperature dynamics  @xcite . at higher temperatures the relaxation is exponential , a direct consequence of brownian - like motion .",
    "by contrast , at lower temperatures the relaxation is exponential only at the early times ( with fast dynamics ) and is followed by a plateau at intermediate times .",
    "this plateau is attributed to the caging effect that results from having each particle temporarily trapped by its neighbors . at longer timescales ,",
    "as the cages start to break and the particles move distances of the order of the inter - particle distances , the relaxation function starts to decay . unlike what happens at high temperatures , the final decay , _ i.e. _ the long time slow dynamics , is usually not exponential and in many cases it is described well by the kohlrausch - williams - watts ( kww ) `` stretched exponential '' function @xmath12^{\\beta } \\right\\},\\ ] ] where we are using some correlation function @xmath13 between the states of the system at times @xmath14 and @xmath15 as an example of a relaxation function . here @xmath16 and @xmath17 are constants and @xmath17 is sometimes called the `` stretching exponent '' or the `` kohlrausch exponent '' .",
    "two extreme scenarios were proposed to explain the non - exponential behavior  @xcite . in one of them",
    "the liquid is heterogeneous , the relaxation is exponential in each small region , there is a spatial distribution of relaxation times @xmath18 , and the relaxation function is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the local two - time correlation in a small region around point @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the corresponding relaxation time . in the other extreme scenario ,",
    "the dynamics of the liquid is homogeneous , the distribution of the relaxation times is a delta function , and the relaxation in all regions is described by a unique function @xmath23 , which is non - exponential : @xmath24 eqs .",
    "( [ eq : het ] ) and ( [ eq : nothet ] ) can be generalized to allow for the simultaneous presence of both heterogeneous relaxation times and non - exponential local relaxation functions  @xcite : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the probability density of relaxation times compatible with the local relaxation function @xmath23 .",
    "if we allow the time difference @xmath27 to be long enough , we can not assume that each local region is characterized by a single relaxation time @xmath28 , because @xmath28 could in principle have fluctuated over this time interval . to take this effect into account ,",
    "let us divide the time interval @xmath29 into @xmath30 sub - intervals @xmath31 such that for each sub - interval the fluctuations in @xmath0 are negligible .",
    "hence , for long time intervals , the local correlation is given by @xmath32,\\ ] ] where @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",

    "another way of looking at local correlations is to consider first the exponential relaxation case where @xmath37 if we allow @xmath38 to fluctuate in space and time but postulate that the same differential equation still holds , then we have @xmath39,\\ ] ] where @xmath20 and @xmath0 are defined as before and we have used the initial condition @xmath40 .",
    "( [ eq : het-2 ] ) can be extended to describe the more general case of non - exponential relaxation .",
    "for example , we can modify the right hand - side of the differential equation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : het-2 ] ) to @xmath41 $ ] . here",
    "the function @xmath42 $ ] represents the effect of non - exponential relaxation .",
    "the solution of the new differential equation , which represents the long - time limit of the local correlation function , is given by @xmath43,\\ ] ] where @xmath44 , and @xmath45 is a monotonous decreasing function that satisfies @xmath46 $ ] and @xmath47 .    by comparing eq .",
    "( [ eq : het - int ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ eq : het - gen ] ) we find that @xmath48 and @xmath49 a completely different way of deriving eq .",
    "( [ eq : het - gen ] ) is based on the presence of time reparametrization symmetry , and we describe it next .",
    "time reparametrization symmetry refers to an invariance under transformations of the time variable @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is a continuous and monotonically increasing function of @xmath14 .",
    "this symmetry has been shown to be present in the long - time dynamics of mean field spin glass models  @xcite and of short range spin glass models  @xcite .",
    "numerical studies in spin glasses  @xcite and structural glasses  @xcite have given strong evidence supporting the presence of this symmetry .",
    "the symmetry has also been used , from a different point of view , to determine properties of symmetric observables whose full dynamical properties are hard to compute  @xcite . the symmetry is spontaneously broken by correlations and relaxation functions .",
    "we can illustrate the breaking of the symmetry by considering the correlation function @xmath13 .",
    "if @xmath13 was symmetric under time reparametrizations @xmath50 , then @xmath52 $ ] for _ all _ mappings @xmath50 , which is only possible if the correlation is independent of time .",
    "but we know that in the long time limit the correlation function of a glass forming liquid decays from its plateau value , therefore the symmetry is broken by @xmath13 .",
    "the broken reparametrization symmetry is expected to give rise to goldstone modes  @xcite associated to smooth variations in space of the reparametrized variable , that is @xmath53 .",
    "the spatio - temporal fluctuations of @xmath3 imply that different regions of a sample relax differently from each other , that the relaxation of the different regions is advanced ( or retarded ) with respect to each other and the bulk , and that `` advanced '' and `` retarded '' regions can switch roles in the course of the relaxation .",
    "hence , the spatio - temporal fluctuations induced by the broken reparametrization symmetry provide a possible explanation for dynamical heterogeneities in glass forming and glassy systems .",
    "in addition , the broken reparametrization symmetry leads to recovering eq .",
    "( [ eq : het - gen ] ) if we ignore longitudinal fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "longitudinal fluctuations should be suppressed by coarse graining in larger regions because at long distances they are less correlated than transverse fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "finally , it should be noticed that there is a gauge symmetry under time - independent shifts of the reparametrization variable @xmath3 , that is in eq .",
    "( [ eq : het - gen ] ) , the local correlation is unchanged by the transformation @xmath54 .",
    "consequently , when we analyze data we can not determine an absolute @xmath3 . to work with gauge - invariant quantities , we either have to go back to studying two - time quantities like @xmath55 or we must work with time derivatives of @xmath3 .",
    "by analogy to the spin glass case , we expect that time reparametrization symmetry , if present , can only be exact in the long time limit , and that at any finite timescale there are symmetry breaking terms , which are expected to become weaker at longer times . in particular , if there is a finite relaxation time in the system , it will provide a cutoff for long timescales , thus precluding the symmetry to show its full effect .",
    "by contrast , for lower temperatures , the dynamics at longer timescales can be explored , and the effects of the symmetry could in principle manifest themselves more clearly . based on this discussion ,",
    "we want to test the hypothesis that at low temperatures and for large coarse - graining regions , the long time correlations are well described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : het - gen ] ) .",
    "this is equivalent to the statement that transverse fluctuations ( goldstone modes ) are much stronger than longitudinal fluctuations .",
    "this interplay between temperature and region sizes implies that the crossover from dominant longitudinal fluctuation to dominant transverse fluctuations should occur for smaller coarse - graining regions for lower temperatures and for larger coarse - graining regions for higher temperatures . in particular , at temperatures moderately below the mode coupling critical temperature @xmath56",
    ", we expect that for long timescales the coarse graining size for which the transverse fluctuations start to be dominant will be smaller than at temperatures moderately above @xmath56 .",
    "our method for the extraction of @xmath3 from local two - time correlations is inspired by the work in refs .",
    "the authors of refs .  @xcite use a functional form @xmath57 , where @xmath58 and @xmath17 are fitting parameters , to fit global correlations in molecular dynamics simulations of particle systems and polymer systems .",

    "\\label{eq : local - fit}\\ ] ] in principle , the functions @xmath61 and @xmath23 , respectively describing global two - time correlations and local two - time correlations , could have completely different forms .",
    "for example , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : equivalence ] , some of the initial motivation for the picture of dynamical heterogeneity came from the idea that non - exponential relaxation in a macroscopic sample is due to the combined effect of local exponential relaxations with different relaxation times . in this picture , @xmath62 and @xmath63 . in refs .",
    "@xcite , as a simplifying assumption , the two functions were taken to be equal . in the present work",
    ", we focus exclusively on the local function @xmath23 . however , we will consider different coarse graining sizes when determining @xmath20 .",
    "each of these coarse graining sizes will give rise to a different form for @xmath23 .",
    "in practice , to simplify the determination of @xmath23 , we will restrict it to be a member of a family of functional forms @xmath64 , parametrized by a vector @xmath65 of @xmath66 components , and for each coarse graining size both the parameter vector @xmath65 and the fluctuating phases @xmath3 will be determined by fitting @xmath20 according to eq .",

    "the description of glassy dynamics that we have presented here , although it is extracted from the two - time quantities that probe freezing in the system , has the advantage that it is expressed in terms of one time quantities , the local phases @xmath3 , or , more properly , their gauge invariant time derivatives @xmath212 .",
    "this should make it possible , in principle , to probe correlations in the dynamics by computing two - point functions , such as @xmath237 , as opposed to four - point functions .",
    "one way of thinking about this is that this advantage in simplicity is gained by coarse graining both in space and in time .",
    "the coarse graining in space is explicit , and has been discussed extensively in this work ; the coarse graining in time happens in the sense that the fitting procedure at the heart of the method focuses on extracting information about the slow part of the dynamics and ignores the fast part . on one hand",

    "we have introduced a new general analysis tool to study glassy dynamics . since the starting point of this analysis",
    "is the determination of local two - time correlations , it can be applied to any experiment or numerical simulation data set which provides enough information to compute those correlations .",
    "this includes not only results from numerical simulations , but also results from visualization experiments  @xcite in which the particle positions are determined as a function of time . more generally , there are other kinds of experiments , such as photon correlation imaging  @xcite , which provide data for local two - time correlations , and in this case too this type of analysis is applicable .",

    "those questions include the determination of the basic statistical properties of the fluctuating quantity @xmath212 , such as its probability distribution and its correlation functions , the study of how those properties vary with changes in the control parameter , namely either the temperature or the volume fraction , and also the study of how they change across different systems exhibiting glass - like dynamics .",
    "in particular , the correlation function @xmath238 encodes important information about dynamical heterogeneity : in the equal - time @xmath239 case it gives very direct information about the spatial extent of the heterogeneous regions , and in the equal - point @xmath240 case it gives information about the persistence in time of those regions .",
