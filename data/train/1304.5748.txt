    "very recently , besiii collaboration studied the process @xmath5 at a center - of - mass energy of @xmath6 , and reported the observation of a new charged charmonium - like structure @xmath1 in the @xmath7 invariant spectrum with a mass of @xmath8 and a width of @xmath9 @xcite . before the besiii s observation , chen _ et al",
    "_ predicted that a charged charmonium - like structure is observable in the @xmath10 process @xcite . in the study of @xmath11",
    "decays , belle collaboration also observed a @xmath12 state with a mass of @xmath13 and a width of @xmath14 in the @xmath7 mass spectrum @xcite .",
    "_ confirmed the charged state @xmath1 in the analysis of data taken with the cleo - c detector at @xmath15 , and measured its mass and width to be @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the new experimental results have aroused theorists great interest in comprehending the internal structures of @xmath1 .",
    "soon after the observation of @xmath1 , it was proposed that these states are @xmath2-wave @xmath0 molecules @xcite .",
    "subsequently , there also appeared many other works to explain this exotic states @xcite . undoubtedly , it is interesting and significative to investigate that whether @xmath1 could be a @xmath2-wave @xmath0 state . to understand the inner structure of @xmath1 ,",
    "it is very helpful and quite needed to determine their properties like masses quantitatively .",
    "nowadays , qcd is widely believed to be the true theory of describing strong interactions .",
    "however , it is quite difficult to acquire the hadron spectrum from qcd first principles .",
    "the main reason is that low energy qcd involves a regime where it is futile to attempt perturbative calculations and the strong interaction dynamics of hadronic systems is governed by nonperturbative qcd effects completely .",
    "meanwhile , one has limited knowledge on nonperturbative qcd aspects for there are still many questions remain unanswered or realized only at a qualitative level .",
    "the method of qcd sum rules @xcite is a nonperturbative formulation firmly based on the basic theory of qcd , which has been successfully applied to conventional hadrons ( for reviews see @xcite and references therein ) and multiquark states ( e.g. see @xcite ) . in particular for the @xmath2-wave @xmath0 molecular state , we have definitely predicted its mass to be @xmath18 with qcd sum rules several years ago in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which mass spectra of molecular states with various @xmath19 configurations have been systematically studied .",
    "numerically , one could see that our prediction for the mass of @xmath0 state agrees well with the experimental data of newly observed @xmath1 .",
    "that result could support the explanation of @xmath1 as a @xmath2-wave @xmath0 molecular state . at present",
    ", we would put forward an improved study of our previous work on the @xmath0 state in view of below reasons .",
    "first , it is known that one can analyze the ope convergence and the pole contribution dominance to determine the conventional borel window in the standard qcd sum rule approach to ensure the validity of qcd sum rule analysis .",
    "however , we find that it may be difficult to find a conventional work window rigidly satisfying both of the two rules in some recent works @xcite , which actually has also been discussed in some other works ( e.g. , refs .",
    "the main reason is that some high dimension condensates are very large and play an important role in the ope side , which makes the standard ope convergence happen only at very large values of borel parameters .",
    "whereas in the previous ref .",
    "@xcite , we merely considered contributions of the operators up to dimension six in ope and the borel windows are roughly taken the same values for the similar class of states for simplicity and convenience .",
    "thus , it may be more reliable to test the ope convergence by including higher dimension condensate contributions than six and considering the work windows minutely , and then one could more safely extract the hadronic information from qcd sum rules .",
    "second , even higher condensate contributions may not radically influence the character of ope convergence in some case , one still could attempt to improve the theoretical result because some higher condensates are helpful to stabilize the borel curves .",
    "particularly for the newly observed @xmath1 states , they can not be simple @xmath20 conventional mesons since they are electric charged .",
    "it may be a new hint for the existence of exotic hadrons and @xmath1 are some ideal candidates for them . once exotic states can be confirmed by experiment",
    ", qcd will be further tested and then one will understand qcd low - energy behaviors more deeply .",
    "therefore , it is of importance and worth to make meticulous theoretical efforts to reveal the underlying structures of @xmath1 .",
    "all in all , we would like to improve our previous work to investigate that whether @xmath1 could serve as a @xmath0 molecular state .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , qcd sum rules for the molecular states are introduced , and both the phenomenological representation and qcd side are derived , followed by the numerical analysis and some discussions in sec .",
    "the last section is a brief summary .",
    "the starting point of the qcd sum rule method is to construct a proper interpolating current to represent the studied state .",
    "one knows that the method of qcd sum rules has been widely applied to multiquark systems since the experimental observations of many new hadrons in these years . at present , currents of molecular states and tetraquark states could be differentiated by their different construction ways . concretely ,",
    "molecular currents are built up with the color - singlet currents of their composed hadrons to form hadron - hadron configurations of fields , which are different from currents of tetraquark states constructed by diquark - antidiquark configurations of fields .",
    "what s needed to note is that these two types of currents can be related to each other by fiertz rearrangement .",
    "however , the transformation relations are suppressed by corresponding color and dirac factors @xcite and one could obtain a reliable sum rule while choosing the appropriate current to represent the physical state .",
    "this means that if the physical state is a molecular state , it would be best to choose a meson - meson type of current so that it has a large overlap with the physical state .",
    "similarly for a tetraquark state , it would be best to choose a diquark - antidiquark type of current .",
    "when the sum rule reproduces a mass consistent well with the physical value , one can infer that the physical state has a structure well represented by the chosen current . in this way",
    ", one can indirectly and commonly discriminate between the molecular and the tetraquark structures of observed states .",
    "one can expect that the judgements could be very effective for some ideal cases , e.g. the results obtained from different types of currents are very different so that one could easily discriminate them .",
    "note that in some exceptional cases that it may not be very different for final results from molecular currents and tetraquark currents .",
    "for example , narison _",
    "investigated both molecular and tetraquark currents associated with @xmath21 and they finally gained the same mass predictions within the accuracy of qcd sum rule method in ref . @xcite .",
    "for the present work , in order to study the possibility of @xmath1 as a @xmath2-wave @xmath0 molecular state , we thus construct the molecular current from corresponding currents of @xmath22 and @xmath23 mesons to form meson - meson configurations of fields .",
    "in full theory , the interpolating currents for heavy @xmath24 mesons can be found in ref .",
    "therefore , one can build the following form of current @xmath25 for @xmath0 with @xmath26 , where @xmath27 indicates the light @xmath28 or @xmath29 quark , @xmath30 denotes the heavy @xmath31 quark , and the subscript @xmath32 and @xmath33 are color indices .",
    "note that the quantum numbers of @xmath1 have not been given experimentally for the moment , and @xmath34 is just one possible choice of their spin - parities .",
    "one can then write down the two - point correlator @xmath35|0\\rangle.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] lorentz covariance implies that the correlator can be generally parameterized as @xmath36 the term proportional to @xmath37 will be chosen to extract the mass sum rule .",
    "phenomenologically , @xmath38 can be expressed as @xmath39^{2}}{m_{\\bar{d}d^{*}}^{2}-q^{2}}+\\frac{1}{\\pi}\\int_{s_{0 } } ^{\\infty}ds\\frac{\\mbox{im}\\pi^{(1)\\mbox{phen}}(s)}{s - q^{2}}+\\mbox{subtractions},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 denotes the mass of the @xmath0 state , @xmath41 is the continuum threshold parameter , and @xmath42 gives the coupling of the current to the hadron @xmath43 . in the ope side , @xmath38 can be written as @xmath44 where the spectral density is given by @xmath45 .",
    "technically , we work at leading order in @xmath46 and consider condensates up to dimension nine , employing the similar techniques as refs .",

    "are three order magnitudes less than the one of heavy @xmath31 quark , they are neglected here following the usual treatment . the resulting light - quark part is combined with the heavy - quark part before it is dimensionally regularized at @xmath49 . after equating eqs .",

    "in this section , the sum rule ( [ sum rule 1 ] ) will be numerically analyzed .",
    "the input values are taken as @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 @xcite . in the standard procedure of sum rule analysis",
    ", one should analyze the ope convergence and the pole contribution dominance to determine the conventional borel window for @xmath51 : on the one side , the lower constraint for @xmath79 is obtained by considering that the perturbative contribution should be larger than each condensate contribution to have a good convergence in the ope side ; on the other side , the upper bound for @xmath79 is obtained by the consideration that the pole contribution should be larger than the continuum state contributions . at the same time , the threshold @xmath80 is not arbitrary but characterizes the beginning of continuum states .",
    "hence , the most expected case is that one could naturally find the conventional borel windows for studied states to make qcd sum rules work well .    in order to test the convergence of ope , its various contributions , i.e. the perturbative , two - quark , two - gluon , mixed , four - quark , three - gluon , two - quark multiply two - gluon , two - quark multiply mixed , four - gluon , two - quark multiply three - gluon , and two - gluon multiply mixed condensate contributions , are compared as a function of @xmath51 and showed in fig .",
    "1 . graphically , one could see that in the ope side there exists some similar problem which has been discussed in some of our recent works @xcite and others e.g. @xcite . concretely , here",
    "some condensates especially two - quark condensate @xmath3 are very large and play an important role in the ope side , which makes the standard ope convergence ( i.e. the perturbative at least larger than each condensate contribution ) happen only at very large values of @xmath51 .",
    "the consequence is that it is difficult to find a conventional borel window where both the pole dominates over the continuum and the ope converges well . following the similar treatment in refs .",
    "@xcite , we could try releasing the rigid convergence criterion of the perturbative contribution larger than each condensate contribution here .",
    "it is not too bad for the present case , there are two main condensates i.e. @xmath3 and @xmath81 and they could cancel out each other to some extent since they have different signs .",
    "what is also very important , most of other condensates calculated are very small , which means that they could not radically influence the character of ope convergence .",
    "therefore , one could find that the ope convergence is still under control here .",
    "in the phenomenological side , the comparison between pole and continuum contributions of sum rule ( [ sumrule1 ] ) as a function of the borel parameter @xmath51 for the threshold value @xmath82 is shown in fig .",
    "2 , which shows that the relative pole contribution is approximate to @xmath83 at @xmath84 and decreases with @xmath79 . similarly , the upper bound values of borel parameters are @xmath85 for @xmath86 and @xmath87 for @xmath88 .",
    "thus , the borel window for @xmath0 is taken as @xmath89 for @xmath90 .",
    "similarly , the proper range of @xmath79 are @xmath91 for @xmath86 and @xmath92 for @xmath88 .",
    "the mass of the @xmath0 molecular state as a function of @xmath51 from sum rule ( [ sum rule 1 ] ) is shown in fig .",
    "3 and it is numerically calculated to be @xmath93 in the above chosen work windows . considering the uncertainty rooting in the variation of quark masses and condensates , we gain @xmath94 ( the first error reflects the uncertainty due to variation of @xmath80 and @xmath79 , and the second error resulted from the variation of qcd parameters ) or concisely @xmath4 for the @xmath2-wave @xmath0 .",

    "stimulated by the newly observed charged charmonium - like structure @xmath1 for which can not be simple @xmath20 conventional mesons and are some ideal candidates for exotic hadrons , we present an improved qcd sum rule study of our previous work on the @xmath0 molecular state to investigate that whether it could be a @xmath2-wave @xmath0 molecular state . in order to ensure the quality of qcd sum rule analysis , contributions of up to dimension nine are calculated to test the convergence of ope .",
    "we find that some condensates in particular @xmath3 play an important role and make the standard ope convergence ( i.e. the perturbative at least larger than each condensate contribution ) happen at very large values of borel parameters @xmath79 . by releasing the rigid ope convergence criterion , one could find that the ope convergence is still under control and the final result @xmath4 is obtained for the @xmath2-wave @xmath0 molecular state , which coincides with the experimental data of @xmath1 . from the final result , one could assuredly state that it could provide some support to the @xmath0 molecular explanation of @xmath1 . at the same time , one should note that the @xmath0 molecular state is just one possible theoretical interpretation of @xmath1 , and it does not mean that one could arbitrarily excluded some other possible explanations ( e.g. tetraquark states ) at the present time just from the result here .",
    "in fact , more minute information on the nature structures of @xmath1 could be revealed by the future contributions of both experimental observations and theoretical studies .",
