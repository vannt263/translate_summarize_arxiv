    "surveys of the galactic white dwarf ( wd ) population have discovered magnetic field strengths ranging up to about @xmath2 @xcite . typically wds fall into two categories , those with field strengths of the order @xmath3 or higher and those with fields weaker than around @xmath4 .",
    "we focus here on highly magnetic wds ( hereinafter mwds ) with field strengths greater than @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite proposed a fossil field mechanism based on the evolution of ap / bp stars but it is difficult to argue that such a field can survive stellar evolution in which all parts of the star have passed through convective phases . here",
    "we build on the proposal of @xcite that the origin of such fields lies in the interaction between the wd and its companion star in a binary system .",
    "this assertion is based on observations from the sdss that approximately @xmath5per cent of isolated wds are highly magnetic @xcite as are @xmath6per cent in cataclysmic variables @xcite while there are none to be found in wide detached binary systems . of the 1253 binary systems comprising a wd and non - degenerate m - dwarf star surveyed in the sdss data release five @xcite none",
    "have been identified with magnetic fields greater than the detection limit of about @xmath7 .",
    "the relatively high occurrence of mwds in strongly interacting binaries compared with elsewhere suggests that the generation of the strong magnetic fields is likely the result of the interaction and subsequent evolution of the binary system .",
    "the mwds observed in isolated systems may be explained by either the total disruption of the companion star during unstable mass transfer or the coalescence of the mwd and the core of its companion following loss of sufficient orbital energy to the common envelope ( hereinafter ce ) or via gravitational radiation .",
    "when a giant with a degenerate core expands beyond its roche lobe mass transfer may proceed on a dynamical time scale .",
    "a dense , typically main - sequence star , companion can not accrete the overflowing material fast enough so that it instead swells up to form a giant ce . as a result of energy transfer and angular momentum to the ce during orbital decay of the dense companion and the remnant core ,",
    "strong differential rotation is established within the envelope .",
    "also , owing to its size and thermal characteristics together with the nuclear energy source at the core , the ce is expected to be largely convective . in the mechanism proposed by tout et al .",
    "this is expected to drive strong dynamo action giving rise to powerful magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "if sufficiently strong dynamo action occurs in the ce then comparable magnetic fields may be induced in the degenerate core ( dc ) that will evolve into a wd once the envelope has been removed .",
    "we show here that strong surface fields can result from ce evolution .",
    "the strength of such fields is highly dependent on the electrical conductivity of dc , the lifetime of the ce and the variability of the magnetic dynamo .",
    "in section 2 we outline the various sources of energy in the binary / ce system and their relation to the energy requirements of the magnetic dynamo . in section 3",
    "we discuss the governing equations of the system and derive the form of the magnetic field for a general spatially and temporally varying magnetic diffusivity @xmath8 via the static induction equation .",
    "then in section 4 we give an overview of the numerical methods we have used to solve the various stages of the problem . in section 5 we present our results and we discuss these and conclude in section 6 .",
    "in the absence of detailed hydrodynamic properties , the most favoured models for common envelope evolution are the so - called @xmath9 @xcite and @xmath10 @xcite prescriptions which use a one dimensional parametrization of the transfer of energy and angular momentum respectively between the binary orbit and the envelope .",
    "we consider the energy content of a typical envelope compared to the energy necessary to generate the desired magnetic fields .",
    "the primary sources of energy in the ce are the orbital energy of the binary system itself and the gravitational binding energy of the envelope . in the @xmath9 prescription",
    ", energy is transferred from the orbit to the envelope and this leads to the expulsion of the envelope and decay of the orbital separation .",
    "this is regarded as the most likely origin of cataclysmic variables @xcite .",
    "other potential sources are the thermal energy content of the envelope and its rotational energy .",
    "however for a virialised cloud , these energies are small compared to the other energy sources . in some systems recombination energy can be similar in magnitude to the binding energy so may become important @xcite .",
    "let @xmath11 @xmath12 and @xmath13 be the binding , orbital and magnetic energy content of the binary / ce system respectively .",
    "@xmath14    where @xmath15 is the mass of the ce with radius @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the mass of the degenerate core , @xmath18 is the mass of the dense companion , @xmath19 is a constant of order unity that might be estimated from stellar models .",
    "the total mass of the system is @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the final orbital separation .",
    "as we would expect , the total available energy is less than the energy required to produce a field of the desired strength throughout the cloud .",
    "however , given that we anticipate that the field is generated by dynamo action , the strongest fields occur where the hydrodynamic motions of the ce are most strongly perturbed .",
    "we imagine this region to be a torus of the orbital radius @xmath21 and cross - sectional radius @xmath22 which is a few times @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the radius of the dense companion and @xmath25 is the radius of the core of the giant .",
    "the energy of the cloud is then approximated by    @xmath26    most of the energy may be derived from the orbital decay of the binary within the ce .",
    "the value of @xmath21 we have taken is for a typical separation with orbital period of @xmath27d and thus represents the final separation of the system .",
    "as the orbit decays , the increase in orbital velocity results in stronger local perturbations to the ce and in an increase in dynamo activity that produces stronger magnetic fields provided the ce is still sufficiently dense around the stellar cores .",
    "therefore it is more appropriate to consider the late stage of ce evolution from the point of view of magnetic dynamos .    for the am herculis system",
    "@xmath28 @xcite , @xmath29 @xcite , @xmath30 @xcite and @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "taking @xmath32 gives @xmath33 .",
    "this represents the limiting radius in which a field of sufficient strength were generated given the total energy available .",
    "this is far larger than the radius of the dc and somewhat larger than the second star and so energetically there is nothing to prevent the necessary field from being generated .",
    "consider the system evolving according to the static induction equation for a general isotropic magnetic diffusivity field , @xmath8 , related to the electrical conductivity , @xmath34 by @xmath35 .",
    "the dc is embedded in an infinite , uniform , vertical , time dependent magnetic field .",
    "this is a sensible approximation provided the length scale for variation of the external field defined by the dynamo action in the ce is sufficiently large compared to the radius of the dc .",
    "we expect the dc to be spherically symmetric and we further assume the external field to be locally axisymmetric at the surface of the dc . in reality the exact form of the imposed field is uncertain and is likely to support a complex geometry .",
    "this is supported by spectropolarimetric observations of wd magnetic field morphologies @xcite .",
    "we consider what effect this might have later on .    except where explicitly stated",
    "otherwise , we are working in spherical polar coordinates @xmath36 .",
    "outside of the dc ( @xmath37 ) we require    @xmath38    and @xmath39    equation  ( [ external ] ) is satisfied locally around the dc because the magnetic field is a superposition of the curl - free imposed field and the dipole field produced by the dc . in the global field",
    "we expect this condition to be broken to the motions of the ce . inside the dc",
    "the magnetic field evolves according to the mhd induction equation with stationary fluid ,    @xmath40    we have ignored the term @xmath41 , assuming that this term , that results from fluid motions within the dc , is dominated by the diffusive term .",
    "if this term were large then we would expect wds to support dynamo action .",
    "this is not supported by the statistics presented in section [ intro ] .",
    "the magnetic field must be continuous at @xmath42 .",
    "we proceed by decomposing the magnetic field into poloidal and toroidal parts    @xmath43    where the first term on the right is the toroidal part of the magnetic field and the second term is the poloidal part . in the case of the magnetic field",
    "external to the dc , equation ( [ external ] ) simplifies to    @xmath44    where @xmath45+\\frac{1}{\\sin^2\\theta}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial\\phi^2}\\right\\}.\\ ] ]    taking @xmath46 ( similarly for @xmath47 ) and given @xmath48 this implies    @xmath49    the condition @xmath50 is equivalent to @xmath51 .",
    "the solutions of @xmath52 give @xmath53 in terms of spherical harmonics . in the far - field",
    "the only mode is that corresponding to @xmath54 . the other modes decay exponentially without some mechanism to regenerate them .",
    "thus we take @xmath53 outside of the dc to be of the form    @xmath55    where @xmath56 is the external field arising from the dynamo activity in the ce . now",
    "consider the field inside the dc . provided",
    "the magnetic diffusivity is spherically symmetric we can again decompose @xmath57 into poloidal and toroidal parts to see that @xmath53 and @xmath47 evolve according to    @xmath58    if we assume that we may write the diffusivity in the self - similar form @xmath59 then the equation is completely separable .",
    "so suppose we write @xmath60 then we find that the two functions satisfy    @xmath61    so that @xmath62 and @xmath63    in the case of spatially constant diffusivity , equation  ( [ helm ] ) is simply helmholtz equation .",
    "choosing solutions which are bounded as @xmath64 gives solutions of the form @xmath65 where @xmath66 represents the @xmath67 spherical bessel function of the first kind and @xmath68 . in order to satisfy continuity in the magnetic field at @xmath42",
    "we must have @xmath69 .",
    "this gives a real value of @xmath21 and so @xmath70 must be real .",
    "so with no way to replenish the toroidal field , @xmath71 exponentially by equation  ( [ 17 ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that although we have assumed that all higher order spherical harmonics , azimuthal modes of the toroidal magnetic field decay exponentially we have not presented here additional consideration to the relative decay times .",
    "given the vertical form of the imposed external field , the dipole mode is the only one induced by the ce and therefore the only mode we focus on . a similar analysis may be performed for other values of @xmath72 but these modes are only important if they are produced by the external field .",
    "the equation for @xmath53 can be treated in a very similar way to @xmath47 .",
    "for @xmath73 we write    @xmath74    by taking @xmath75 the system is reduced to a fourier analysis .",
    "it is possible to use different transform methods with different choices of the parameter @xmath10 .",
    "however , because we shall consider an oscillating external field , this is the natural choice . in this form",
    "the function is still separable and @xmath76 solves the equation    @xmath77    so that @xmath78    in order to enforce continuity at the boundary we must have @xmath79 continuous at @xmath42 for all @xmath80 .",
    "these are equivalent to    @xmath81    and @xmath82    by taking @xmath83 and @xmath84 these become    @xmath85    and @xmath86    we take @xmath87 as given and so focus for the moment on the second of these equations .",
    "this allows us to solve for @xmath53 and then we can derive the magnetic field within the dc .",
    "so if the transform of @xmath88 is @xmath89 then we may rewrite the previous equation as    @xmath90    so given the condition @xmath91 as @xmath92 and this boundary condition we can now fully determine @xmath76 .",
    "this in turn fully solves the internal ( and external ) dipole field of the dc . in the case",
    "@xmath93 , @xmath94 , the internal magnetic field ( for a particular @xmath10 ) is given by    @xmath95    in theory we may solve this system exactly for any imposed field .",
    "however , owing to the complexity of the external field and its fourier transform under the change of variable @xmath96 , numerical computations become extremely difficult . thus , for the most part , we focus on single modes given by some specific @xmath10 .",
    "this is ultimately justified by the slow variation of @xmath97 during the lifetime of the ce .    in the case where the induced magnetic field is",
    "not entirely dipolar , the final term in equation  ( [ helmholtz ] ) is modified by some factor for each @xmath72 . in the case of uniform diffusivity",
    "this gives spherical bessel functions of varying order .",
    "the forms of these functions in this parameter regime are actually very similar to the first order function considered in section [ uniform ] so we do not expect including the higher modes to affect the qualitative results significantly for the overall strength and radial variation of the internal field .",
    "in addition , given the uncertainties regarding the geometry of the magnetic field of the ce , inclusion of higher order harmonics is unlikely to give any better insight .",
    "we calculated the spatial form of the magnetic field in the presence of an oscillating external field with a sixth order adaptive step runge - kutta algorithm @xcite according to equation ( [ field ] ) .",
    "the equation was integrated from the centre out to the surface with boundary conditions @xmath98 and a small arbitrary value of @xmath99 .",
    "the solution grows by several thousand orders of magnitude between @xmath100 and @xmath42 . to cope with this variation ,",
    "we included a subroutine to rescale the solution whenever @xmath101 or its derivatives exceeded some maximum value , typically @xmath102 .",
    "once a solution had been found the boundary condition at @xmath42 , given by equation  ( [ boundary ] ) , was matched by scaling the entire function .",
    "such arbitrary rescalings are valid because of the homogeneous nature of the governing ode and the zero boundary condition at @xmath100 . in order to calculate the diffusivity field we employed the approximation of @xcite for the electrical conductivity .",
    "in addition we needed to calculate the opacity for the given temperature and density .",
    "this was done with the data tables and subroutines of the stars stellar evolution code @xcite . in all simulations",
    "we have used a co  wd composition for the dc .",
    "the time evolution of the magnetic field following the dispersal of the external field was calculated with a first order euler finite step method .",
    "the code was run multiple times with a variety of step sizes and spatial resolutions with no significant variation in the solution between runs .",
    "the induction equation was simplified by the relations    @xmath103    and @xmath104    this removes the spherical geometry of the induction equation , reducing it to the form    @xmath105    which has a zero boundary condition at @xmath42 in the absence of an external field and is ultimately easier to work with .",
    "the function @xmath76 and subsequently @xmath57 are then recovered from @xmath106 with the relation in equation  ( [ q_1 ] ) numerically evaluated with the trapezoidal rule .",
    "the routine does not take into account dc cooling .",
    "this is unlikely to affect the evolution of the field during the ce phase and shortly after when the field is evolving rapidly . in the late time evolution",
    "however when the field has finished its radial redistribution and is decaying purely exponentially , @xcite showed that the cooling significantly increases the decay timescale and the magnetic field becomes essentially frozen into the dwarf .",
    "therefore we may take the final value for the field strength shortly after it has reached a state of exponential decay .",
    "this is typically around @xmath107yr after the dispersion of the ce .",
    "the magnetic field produced by the ce is heavily dependent on several key factors .",
    "although the magnetic field of the dc and the ce is continuous at the surface , the total magnetic flux able to penetrate the dc depends on the lifetime of the ce .",
    "once the ce has dispersed , the field continues to migrate inwards and the surface field strength to decay .",
    "the degree to which this happens depends on how much of the field is able to penetrate the dc while the surface field is still maintained .",
    "this requires a suitable treatment of the radial conductivity profile of the dc . as the density increases towards the centre of the dc",
    "the conductivity rises rapidly , inhibiting further diffusion of the field .",
    "this results in the confinement of the field to around the outer 10per cent of the dc by radius .",
    "the structure and orientation of the magnetic field of the ce is also of critical importance . in a convectively driven magnetic dynamo",
    "we might expect the orientation of the field to change rapidly .",
    "the frequency of the changes has important consequences for the field .",
    "given the geometry of the system driving the fluid motions which in turn give rise to the magnetic dynamo we might also anticipate a preferred direction to the orientation of the field .",
    "a field that is maintained in a single direction produces a wd field several orders in magnitude stronger than one in which the orientation varies rapidly and with random orientation .",
    "the lifetime of the ce has a complicated relationship to the original orbital separation of the binary system , the size of the envelope and the properties of the degenerate core and its companion .",
    "this is to be expected because of the wide range of magnetic field strengths in mwds .",
    "here we consider how quickly a field may be built up in the dc as a result of an applied uniform constant vertical magnetic field outside .",
    "this mechanism produces stronger magnetic fields than one with varying orientation but it is the best case scenario and places an upper bound on how much field might be retained .",
    "while the mhd properties of ces are not understood , it is difficult to say to what degree there may be a preferred orientation for the magnetic field so the true physical system may resemble anything in between a uni - directional field and one that reorients itself randomly in any direction .",
    "that results from a constant , uniform , vertical magnetic field applied to a dc for ( 1 ) @xmath108 , ( 2 ) @xmath109 , ( 3 ) @xmath110 , ( 4 ) @xmath111 . note the peak of the field strength at the end of the phase where the external field is applied . after the removal of the external field there is a period of rapid decay lasting around @xmath112",
    "after which the field decays much more slowly on a timescale of around @xmath113 .",
    "the strength of the field is roughly proportional to the lifetime of the external field.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]     that results from a constant , uniform , vertical magnetic field applied to a dc for ( 1 ) @xmath108 , ( 2 ) @xmath109 , ( 3 ) @xmath110 , ( 4 ) @xmath111 .",
    "the magnetic field does not exhibit the same peaks as at @xmath114 because the saturation of the field takes significantly longer than closer to the surface .",
    "the field here continues to grow even after the rapid decay phase of the field closer to the surface as it continues to diffuse inwards .",
    "we also see that the strength of the field is roughly proportional to the lifetime of the external field.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]     that results from a constant , uniform , vertical magnetic field applied to a dc for ( 1 ) @xmath108 , ( 2 ) @xmath109 , ( 3 ) @xmath110 , ( 4 ) @xmath111 .",
    "note the peak of the field strength at the end of the phase where the external field is applied .",
    "after the removal of the external field there is a period of rapid decay lasting around @xmath112 after which the field decays much more slowly on a timescale of around @xmath113 .",
    "the strength of the meridional field is several orders of magnitude larger than the radial field .",
    "the strength of the field is roughly proportional to the lifetime of the external field.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]     that results from a constant , uniform , vertical magnetic field applied to a dc for ( 1 ) @xmath108 , ( 2 ) @xmath109 , ( 3 ) @xmath110 , ( 4 ) @xmath111 .",
    "the magnetic field does not exhibit the same peaks as at @xmath114 because the saturation of the field takes significantly longer than closer to the surface .",
    "the field here continues to grow even after the rapid decay phase of the field closer to the surface as it continues to diffuse inwards .",
    "we also see that the strength of the field is roughly proportional to the lifetime of the external field.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    we applied a constant external field of @xmath115 to a dc of radius @xmath116 , mass @xmath117 with diffusivity profile determined by a polytropic index of @xmath118 and temperature @xmath119 .",
    "the equations for electrical conductivity from @xcite are not strongly temperature dependent in the highly degenerate density regime . as such ,",
    "the diffusivity profile for wds of temperatures varying between @xmath120k and @xmath107k only show noticeable differences at the surface .",
    "this has no significant effect on the evolution of the dc field in our model .",
    "the magnetic field of the wd scales linearly with the applied field .",
    "we tested the cases where the field was applied for @xmath121 and @xmath111 .",
    "the radial and meridional fields at @xmath122 and @xmath123 are shown in figures [ applied ] to [ applied4 ] .",
    "for @xmath114 we note the two distinct phases of the solution .",
    "first there is the initial growth phase in the presence of the external field . once the external field is removed the field strength peaks and begins to decay .",
    "the strength of the field that remains after the removal of the external field increases in proportion to the lifetime of the external field . following the removal of the external field , the surface field of",
    "the exposed wd decays rapidly for around @xmath111 before continuing to decay exponentially with a characteristic timescale of around @xmath113 .",
    "whilst this rate of decay is too rapid to explain the existence of long - lived wd magnetic fields , our simulations have not included wd cooling .",
    "the results of @xcite indicate that cooling causes the diffusivity to decrease and significantly extends the decay time scale for the magnetic field .",
    "this effectively freezes the field .",
    "if we suppose the magnetic field is frozen after @xmath124 when the field has relaxed to its post ce state then the residual magnetic field strength produced by an external field of strength @xmath125 with lifetime @xmath126 , taking into account both radial and meridional components , is approximately    @xmath127    from the results at @xmath123 we see that the field continues to diffuse inwards after the removal of the external field until it reaches saturation point .",
    "this is because the diffusivity decreases towards the interior of the wd .",
    "once the field reaches a certain point , the diffusion becomes so slow that it is effectively halted .",
    "this is extremely important if we wish to build strong surface fields because it prevents any further redistribution of magnetic energy .",
    "if we look at the magnetic field further into the star we see that the field does nt penetrate any deeper than @xmath128 after @xmath113 and the field inside @xmath123 is extremely weak compared to the surface field .",
    "if the direction of the applied field is not constant , as we might expect from a dynamo driven field , then typically the final field strength is reduced by some factor based on the degree of variation . for a spatially constant conductivity with oscillating boundary conditions",
    "we may solve the induction equation analytically .",
    "this gives us some insight into the mechanisms preventing the build up of strong fields in the case of a rapidly varying external field .",
    "we also simulated the change in orientation numerically by taking the field generated by applying a magnetic field for a short time in a single orientation and then taking the sum of the same field rotated at random angles at each timestep up until the dispersion of the ce .",
    "in the case where @xmath129 is a constant we are able to solve for @xmath76 analytically as in section [ equations ] . in this case , @xmath130 and equation  ( [ helmholtz ] ) becomes the helmholtz equation and we seek solutions in the form of spherical bessel functions .",
    "we find that @xmath131 .",
    "then from equations ( [ boundary2 ] ) and ( [ s ] ) we find    @xmath132    consider the strength of the field generated at the surface of the dc by each @xmath10-mode .",
    "we define @xmath133 by    @xmath134.\\ ] ]    we shall refer to @xmath133 as the transfer efficiency because it represents roughly the radial magnetic flux across the surface of the dc relative to the imposed field .",
    "[ q ] shows how @xmath133 varies .",
    "we see that for @xmath135 , @xmath133 falls off approximately as @xmath136 .",
    "so the higher @xmath10 modes of the system are more effectively suppressed but the fall off is slow .",
    "this means that the radial magnetic field at the surface of the star for very large @xmath10 approaches @xmath137 .",
    "in this case the boundary conditions are matched by the dipolar field which cancels out the imposed field at the surface of the dc .",
    "we can see this by evaluating the term in the integrand of equation  [ dipole ] at @xmath42 for a specific value of @xmath10 .",
    "the term tends to @xmath138 as @xmath139 .",
    "this is exactly what is required to cancel the imposed field .     as described in section [ qparameter].,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    if we consider a system with constant diffusivity @xmath97 , then @xmath140 . if we then take @xmath141 it is easy to show that the transfer efficiency is @xmath142 .",
    "we interpret this by recognising that , if the rate of oscillation is too high compared to the diffusivity each time the external field switches , most of the field generated by the previous oscillation is cancelled out . if the diffusivity is high enough , the oscillations are less effectively cancelled and a residual field is able to build up .",
    "now let us consider the radial form of the induced field . from our discussion",
    "above we expect that the field is functionally similar to @xmath143 $ ] .",
    "[ fieldfig ] shows the form of the field that results from this solution ( equations [ uniform ] , [ boundary ] and [ field ] ) .",
    "we have used the parameters given above and an imposed field strength of @xmath144 .",
    "so , although the transfer efficiency is very low and the radial field is suppressed , the strong @xmath76 gradient produces an internal field parallel to the surface which is comparable in magnitude to the imposed field but decays extremely rapidly with depth .",
    "the thickness of this layer behaves asymptotically as @xmath145 .",
    "we note that this is the same behaviour as the efficiency factor @xmath133 .",
    "this is reasonable because the efficiency of transfer of magnetic energy from the external field to the dc should scale roughly in proportion to how far the field can penetrate , at least for shallow layers .     with variation frequency @xmath146 for an imposed field of @xmath144 .",
    "( 1 ) radial field ( @xmath147 ) , ( 2 ) meridional field ( @xmath148 ) .",
    "we see from the horizontal axis that the field is confined to the most outer regions of the dc . this is because the rapid variation of the external field causes any field that is generated at the surface to smooth out to zero as it diffuses inwards .",
    "we also see that the meridional field is several orders of magnitude stronger than the radial field.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    because we are proposing a model in which the magnetic field of a common envelope surrounding a binary system induces the magnetic field of the dc we choose a value of @xmath9 to reflect this .",
    "first consider a far - field varying on a time scale similar to the orbital period of the binary system .",
    "we determine this time scale for a @xmath149 dc with a typical red giant companion of mass @xmath150 and radius @xmath151 which has filled its roche lobe .",
    "this gives us an orbital time scale of @xmath152 and so we choose @xmath153 .",
    "this gives a transfer efficiency of @xmath154 .",
    "alternatively as we suggested earlier , the magnetic dynamo is likely to be stronger when the orbit of the binary has decayed .",
    "if we apply the same analysis with @xmath155 then @xmath156 . in either case , the field is still confined to a very thin boundary layer and is almost entirely meridional .      following the initial generation of the magnetic field within the dc we foresee two possible cases for the subsequent evolution .",
    "either the ce is dispersed on a time scale shorter than the variation of magnetic diffusivity or the diffusivity varies by a significant factor over the lifetime of the ce . in the absence of a magnetic field , the lifetime of the ce phase is estimated on the order of @xmath157yr @xcite .",
    "the time scale for orbital decay as a result of a dynamo driven wind is estimated to be a few myr @xcite .",
    "if energy from orbital decay is transformed to magnetic energy rather than unbinding the envelope then the lifetime of the ce phase is prolonged though from the energy considerations of section [ energy ] the lifetime is likely to lie much closer to the lower bound .",
    "depending on the degree to which this happens the lifetime of the dynamo may lie anywhere between these two bounds .",
    "typically the diffusivity varies on a time scale of @xmath158 , much longer than the probable lifetime of the ce .",
    "however our understanding of ce evolution is sufficiently poor that these estimates may bear little resemblance to reality .",

    "@xcite showed that the magnetic field of a wd without an imposed field has a decay time which is much longer than the evolutionary age of the wd over its whole lifetime and so the magnetic field is essentially frozen into the wd .",

    "the surface magnetic field decays by about a factor of @xmath175 as it relaxes owing to the redistribution of the magnetic energy over the radius .",

    "we find that in the case of a purely random orientation , the residual field is smaller than the constant external field case by a factor of around @xmath214 .",

    "the fluctuations arise from the random nature of the field orientation and the different times at which each field is applied .",
    "it seems certain that the magnetic field strength that would be needed to generate observed magnetic fields would be extremely large in this case .      due to the nature of the proposed magnetic dynamo it seems reasonable to suggest that there may be a preferred direction to the magnetic field .",
    "if the field is generated by perturbations in the ce owing to the orbital motion of the dc and its companion , the magnetic field lines may show a tendency to align with the orbit .",

    "the statistical occurrence of magnetic wds in close interacting binary systems suggests that the origin of their strong fields is a product of some feature of their binary evolution .",
    "indeed , the argument that the fields originate through flux conservation during the collapse of ap / bp stars does not explain the higher frequency in interacting binaries . by building on the proposal that the magnetic field is generated by dynamo action within a common convective envelope",
    "we have shown that strong fields may be transferred to the dc .",
    "these fields can then be preserved upon dissipation of the envelope .    following the dissipation of the ce",
    ", we have found that the system rapidly relaxes on a timescale of about @xmath241 to the state we would anticipate given no external field .",
    "although there is no significant dissipation of magnetic energy during this time , the redistribution of magnetic flux towards the interior of the wd results in significant decay of the surface field by around a factor of at least @xmath242 .",
    "further decay is prevented by the increasing electrical conductivity towards the interior of the wd .",
    "this prevents field diffusing beyond around @xmath243 .",
    "once the field has relaxed to its new configuration it continues to decay but on a timescale much longer than the time scale for cooling of the wd so we expect any further loss of field strength to be minimal .    the maximal rate of transfer of field energy from the ce to the dc occurs when the field is kept fixed . in this case the residual strength of the field following dissipation of the ce is linearly related to the lifetime of the ce .",
    "if we combine equations ( [ me ] ) and ( [ res ] ) we find    @xmath244    if we assume that all of the energy released through orbital decay is transformed into magnetic energy then this requires an envelope lifetime of @xmath245s or @xmath246yr to produce a @xmath107 g magnetic field .",
    "this lifetime is extended if there is variation in the direction of the field produced by the dynamo or there are energy sinks other than the magnetic field . because the required envelope lifetime scales linearly with @xmath247 ,",
    "weaker fields could be produced on a much shorter time scale .",
    "energetically there is nothing to prevent formation of a @xmath0 g mwd .",
    "as shown , the final field strength scales proportionally with the ce lifetime .",
    "if the dynamo is confined to a smaller region or the ce lifetime is extended then this strength of field could be produced .",
    "scenarios this extreme seem unlikely and this is complemented by the rarity of mwds with such strong magnetic fields .",
    "we do not rule out the possibility that the strongest fields may be produced by the merger of a white dwarf and the core of a giant star which have both been strongly magnetized during ce phases .",
    "we have also shown that the production of sufficiently strong fields is almost certainly dependent on some preferred orientation of the magnetic dynamo . in the case",
    "where there is no preferred direction the dc magnetic field is confined to a layer of thickness about @xmath145 , where @xmath9 is the frequency for field variation , and is almost entirely meridional . despite the generation of strong surface fields during the ce phase in this case ,",
    "the total magnetic energy of the dc field is constrained by the depth of the magnetic layer . consequently once the ce disperses and the field of the exposed wd begins to diffuse inwards ,",
    "the majority of the field strength is lost .",
    "this result is confirmed by the numerical simulations .",
    "typically a field strength of @xmath248 relative to the average magnetic field strength of the dynamo is the largest possible residual field",
    ". this may be sufficient to produce wds with weaker fields but the formation of the strongest wd magnetic fields would require far more energy than the system could provide . in the case where the field has some preferred orientation , the proportion of field retained is increased up to a few per cent depending on the lifetime of the ce dynamo .    whilst the arguments we have presented here suggest that the origin of the fields of mwds may be the result of dynamo action in ces of closely interacting binaries , there are still many uncertainties .",
    "most of these are the result of insufficient understanding of the formation and evolution of ces .",
    "the field structures we have used to construct our models are simple but complex field geometries are observed in wds such as feige  7 and kpd 0253 + 5052 .",
    "if ce dynamos are responsible for the origins of mwds , they should support complex geometries .",
    "further progress depends on a better understanding of the physical processes and energy transfer within the ce .",
