    "faraday rotation ( fr ) describes the effect by which the electric field vector of propagating electromagnetic ( em ) radiation rotates as it propagates through a magnetized plasma .",
    "the em waves interact with charged particles such that the left and right handed components experience different refractive indices and propagate at different phase velocities .",
    "the net electric field vector rotates as the wave propagates .",
    "the total amount of this fr between source and observer depends on the strength and orientation of the intervening magnetic field along the line of sight , the plasma density and the plasma composition .",
    "fr has been used , for example , to constrain the the strength , gradient , and direction of magnetic field in agn jets@xcite , galaxy clusters ( ref ) and the galactic ism ( ref ) .",
    "typically , calculations of fr are made for a neutral ion - electron plasma .",
    "while this is a good approximation for the plasma of the galactic ism and galaxy clusters , it is less reliable for magnetospheres and outflows around neutron stars and black holes . in particular , constraining the composition of jets in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is observationally difficult because only the electrons or positrons radiate efficiently so free energy in protons is hard to directly to detect .",
    "the plausible predominance of electron - plasma in the magnetosphere of the black hole and the uncertainty as to whether jets emanate directly from its magnetosphere @xcite or from the surrounding accretion disk @xcite has contributed to making the composition determination a long standing puzzle .",
    "the basic question of how far a jet would be force - free ( @xcite ) is also a fundamental issue .",
    "indirect theoretical constraints on agn jet plasma composition reach mixed conclusions : @xcite and @xcite favor predominately electron - proton jets , whilst @xcite favors a predominantly electron - positron jet for m87 .",
    "@xcite argued that on the largest scales , stellar wind mass loading will significantly proton load the jet regardless of its initial composition .",
    "it is therefore important to identify possible new techniques for determining jet plasma composition and to be aware of its effect on measurements such as fr .    with the above motivations in mind , we calculate the effect of plasma composition on fr from first principles . in section 2",
    "we first derive the general exact formula for fr in an arbitrary neutral plasmas .",
    "we then consider the special cases of a pure ion electron plasmas and an ion - electron - positron plasma . in section 3",
    "we solve the exact and high frequency approximations to the general fr equation and show quantitatively how plasma composition leads to degeneracies in the electron number density @xmath0 , the magnetic field @xmath1 .",
    "we discuss how these degeneracies can in principle be used to constrain the plasma composition in agn jets , and conclude in section 4 .",
    "to formally derive fr for an arbitrary neutral plasma , we assume a cold neutral plasma in a background external magnetic field @xmath2 , subject to a perturbation from a propagating electromagnetic wave .",
    "( the cold plasma approximation for fr has been shown to be effective for the electron contribution to fr even for quasi - relativistic plasmas @xcite , and we discuss this further below eq.([16aa ] ) ) .",
    "for the electric field @xmath3 , magnetic field @xmath4 and induced particle velocity @xmath5 ( where the index @xmath6 indicates particle species ) we write @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are perturbations such that @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "we also assume a neutral plasma so that @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the unperturbed density of a particle of species @xmath6 , and @xmath15 is charge of particle of species @xmath6 .    using the above formalism ,",
    "maxwell equations become ( e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath16 if the current density @xmath17 , then @xmath18 & @xmath19 are decoupled , resulting in the plane wave vacuum equations .",
    "however a finite @xmath20 and the lorentz force equation @xmath21 imply that in general , that @xmath3 , @xmath22 , and @xmath5 are all coupled .    to quantify the interaction between the particles and em fields , we take @xmath23 so eq.([4 ] )",
    "becomes @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the cyclotron frequency of species @xmath6 .",
    "the current density can then be expressed as the product of a conductivity tensor and the @xmath8 field , namely @xmath26 , where the conductivity tensor is given by @xcite @xmath27 } \\left(\\delta_{ij}-\\frac{\\omega_{cs , i } \\omega_{cs , j}}{\\omega^{2}}- \\frac{i}{\\omega}\\epsilon_{ijk}\\omega_{cs , k}\\right).&\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we now take @xmath28 so that the components of eq.([lorentz force ] ) become @xmath29 and , the conductivity tensor becomes @xmath30 eq.([fr derivation1 ] ) with @xmath31 then becomes @xmath32 from which the secular equation for the fr effect is @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and the plasma frequency and wave vector are given respectively by @xmath37 and @xmath38 .    the solution of eq.([fr dispersion relation - matrix ] ) for refractive index @xmath39 produces non - trivial fr when the the two solutions for @xmath39 are distinct , corresponding to left and right handed polarizations ; @xmath40=@xmath41 , @xmath42=@xmath43 with two associated @xmath8 field eigenvectors .",
    "the transverse @xmath44 components of @xmath3 for each refractive index are of the same magnitude but have different phases , that is , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , where @xmath47 arises from the differentiation of velocity and position over time in the lorentz force law .",
    "the equal amplitude of the transverse @xmath48 field components then imply circularly polarized waves .    the different phase velocities ( @xmath49 ) cause the propagating left and right handed circularly polarized waves to experience a net phase angle difference when they propagate over the same distance . as a result , the net electric field phase angle ( @xmath50 ) that comes from the superposition of these handed waves rotates along the propagating distance .",
    "this is the fr .",
    "the change @xmath51 along the propagation distance is @xmath52    having derived the general formalism for a neutral plasma of arbitrary composition and the exact equation for fr ( eq.([theoretical fr expression1 ] ) ) , we note that @xcite considered fr in an ion - electron positron plasma producing the approximate analytical result @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the ion charge number .",
    "eq.([fr approximate equation shukla ] ) agrees with eq.([theoretical fr expression1 ] ) in the high frequency limit for an ion - electron - positron plasma , a point we will return to in section 2.3 .",
    "eq.([fr approximate equation shukla ] ) indicates there is no fr in case of an electron - positron pair plasma(@xmath55 ) . for @xmath56 ,",
    "ions generate the fr by breaking the symmetry of a pair plasma .      for a pure ( hydrogen )",
    "ion - electron plasma , eq.([neutral ] ) takes the form @xmath57 , where @xmath0 and @xmath58 are the electron and hydrogen ion number densities . the summation over @xmath6 in eq.([theoretical fr expression1 ] ) also involves terms corresponding to electrons and ions respectively .",
    "however , because of the large ion to electron mass ratio @xmath59 , the ion terms are typically ignored ( e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "then the rotated angle integrated along the line of sight for the distance @xmath60 ( e.g. @xcite ) becomes @xmath61    where the second relation follows for @xmath62 .",
    "the general procedure for determining rm is to measure @xmath51 at multiple wavelengths and infer a slope of the @xmath51 vs. @xmath63 line",
    ".      for the hydrogen ion - electron - positron case eq.([neutral ] ) becomes @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the positron number density .",
    "we now define @xmath66 so that @xmath67 eq.([theoretical fr expression1 ] ) then becomes @xmath68 where @xmath69 represents the second term under the first square root of the second equality and @xmath70 represents the second term under the second square root of the second equality .",
    "eq.([theoretical fr expression1 ] ) , ( [ fr approximate equation shukla ] ) and ( [ exact fr expression ] ) presume a cold plasma and it is instructive to comment on the validity of these expressions for a warm plasma . for the latter",
    ", motions of charged particles are influenced by thermal effects in addition to the electromagnetic force and to express the current density the solution of vlasov equation is necessary ( e.g. @xcite , chapt .",
    "@xcite studied fr for a warm ion - electron plasma and found that for large frequencies away from resonances , the correction to the electron contribution to fr is small compared to the cold plasma term . however , for a pair plasma in which the electron and positron cold plasma terms cancel exactly , warm plasma correction terms would not cancel exactly and a finite contribution would remain as the positron and electron correction terms do not cancel .",
    "we ignore these small corrections for present purposes and leave further discussion for future work .    in the high frequency limit , @xmath71 and @xmath72 , and we can approximate eq.([exact fr expression ] ) as @xmath73    using eq.([definition of densities ] ) , then eq.([fr approximate equation ] ) is the same as eq.([fr approximate equation shukla ] ) .    for a pure neutral pair plasma ( @xmath74=1 ) , the right side of eq.([exact fr expression ] ) ( or ( [ fr approximate equation ] ) ) vanishes .",
    "the fr vanishes because the equal mass of positrons and electrons induce the same phase speeds for oppositely handed em waves .",
    "this contrasts the limit of the previous subsection of a pure neutral ( hydrogen ) ion - electron plasma ( @xmath75 ) , for which the mass asymmetry leads to unequal phase speeds of the oppositely handed waves and a finite right side of eq.([exact fr expression ] ) . in general , for @xmath76 with @xmath0 , @xmath77 and source distance fixed , the right side of eq.([exact fr expression ] ) decreases with increasing @xmath74 .",
    "we discuss solutions of eq.([exact fr expression ] ) in the next section .",
    "note that the exact fr expression ( [ exact fr expression ] ) has singularities when the wave frequency of the em wave coincides with the particle cyclotron frequencies , i.e. at @xmath78 ( for electrons and positrons ) and @xmath79 ( for ions ) .",
    "the fr would exhibit sharp resonance features near the singular points , allowing the @xmath1 field to be inferred in principle .",
    "however , for applications to extended jets of agn and larger scale systems , these resonant frequencies are generally small compared to the relevant @xmath80 ghz frequencies .",
    "figs.1 and 2 show solutions to the exact expression eq.([exact fr expression ] ) and the approximation eq.([fr approximate equation ] ) for @xmath81 , @xmath1 and @xmath74 at fixed values of rms ( 2592 rad / m@xmath82 in fig.1 . and 1000 rad / m@xmath82 in fig.2 ) .",
    "the rms were converted into rotation angles for @xmath83 scale at @xmath63= 1.35 @xmath83(22.2ghz ) .",
    "the fr in fig.1 corresponds to 3.63 pc ( 749 mpc @xmath84 0.5 mas , c1 region ) from the core of agn jet 3c 273 from @xcite . from synchrotron emission , @xcite calculated the total magnetic field to be ( @xmath85 g ) in this region .",
    "if this were the line of sight field , fig.[fig : x vs ln b ] shows that @xmath860.05 @xmath87 for rm ( 2592 rad m@xmath88 ) , the minimum @xmath0 occurring at @xmath75 .",
    "fig.[fig : x vs ln n cluster ] shows a complementary example for values appropriate for a typical x - ray cluster ( @xcite ) with @xmath89 0.003 @xmath87 and rm @xmath80 1000 rad @xmath90 . the standard assumption that @xmath75 for a known distance leads directly to the inference that @xmath91g@xcite .",
    "but for any @xmath92 , fig.[fig : x vs ln b cluster ] for example , shows how much stronger the field could be .",
    "for fixed values of rm , figs.[fig : n vs ln b ] , and [ fig :",
    "n vs ln b cluster ] show that @xmath81 and @xmath1 behave oppositely for each value of @xmath74 : as @xmath81 increases ( decreases ) , @xmath1 decreases ( increases ) .",
    "these trends reflect that the rm is roughly proportional to the field and the density .",
    "figs.[fig : n vs ln b ] , [ fig : x vs ln b ] , [ fig : n vs ln b cluster ] , and [ fig : x vs ln b cluster ] show that as @xmath74 increases ( decreases ) , @xmath1 and @xmath81 increase ( decrease ) respectively . these trends result because an increasing @xmath74 means a higher fraction of pair plasma .",
    "the latter contributes zero fr so that a higher @xmath1 or @xmath0 is needed for a fixed rm .",
    "figs.[fig : x vs ln n ] , and [ fig : x vs ln n cluster ] reflect these same trends .    in all panels , the lines resulting from eq.([exact fr expression ] )",
    "are indistinguishable from those obtained using eq.([fr approximate equation ] ) for the parameters used , highlighting the efficacy of the latter .",
    "figs.[fig : n vs ln b cluster ] , [ fig : x vs ln b cluster ] and [ fig : x vs ln n cluster ] are very similar to figs.[fig : n vs ln b ] , [ fig : x vs ln b ] and [ fig : x vs ln n ] as only the vertical axis scales are different due to the different rm choices .",
    "overall , the figures show how an unknown plasma composition @xmath74 implies degeneracies in the values @xmath0 and @xmath1 , or complementarily , how independent measures of @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be combined with an rm to constrain @xmath74 .      if the rm and two of the three quantities @xmath81 , @xmath74 and @xmath1 are independently known , the fr equation is exactly determined .",
    "however , even if only one variable and rm are known , the other variables can be constrained",
    ".    there have been efforts to interpret the rm with a subset of independently measured variables @xmath81 , @xmath1 and @xmath93 .",
    "for example , @xcite calculated the @xmath1 field in m87 using the rm and an independently determined @xmath81 . for rm = -4000 rad @xmath90 ,",
    "eq.([1st order expanded fr ] ) was used to get @xmath9415 @xmath95 , but @xmath75 was assumed . we can revisit the interpretation of the measured rm without assuming @xmath75 a priori . as seen in fig.[fig : log b vs x m87 ] , the cross point of @xmath9415 @xmath95 and rm = -4000 rad @xmath90 with @xmath81 = 1100@xmath87 ( dashed line ) is @xmath75 .",
    "in contrast , if we suppose that @xmath1 = 200 @xmath95 , which corresponds to the thermal equipartition condition when @xmath96 ( @xmath97 where @xmath1 is the mean line of sight field that causes fr , e.g. @xcite ) , different @xmath74 values result : for rm = 9000 rad @xmath90 and -4000 rad @xmath90 , the @xmath74 values are 0.83 and 0.92 respectively .",
    "the corresponding @xmath98 values are 913 and 1012 @xmath87 .",
    "if instead magnetic pressure dominates ( e.g. dominant ( @xmath99 ) , then @xmath74 increases as shown in fig.3 .    as another set of examples showing the degeneracy between @xmath1 and @xmath74 , we consider the independently measured rm , @xmath81 , @xmath1 and @xmath93 for clusters a400 , a1795 and a2199 @xcite which respectively include radio sources 3c75 , 4c46.42 and 3c338 to obtain fig.[fig : ln b vs x ( a ) ] .",
    "@xmath1 is also the mean line of sight field but we note that the definition of the magnetic pressure ( @xmath100 ) is different from that of @xcite .",
    "we have taken this into account when interpreting their respective data . there , instead of assuming @xmath75 , as is normally done to obtain the @xmath1 ,",
    "we chose selected field strengths ( straight lines on the plot ) and identify the constraints this places on @xmath74 by where these lines intersect with the curves .",
    "for example , for a400 , if magnetic and thermal pressures were in equipartition ( @xmath101 ) , the data would imply @xmath102 ( here @xmath103 @xmath87 , @xmath104 @xmath87 , @xmath105 @xmath106 @xmath87 ) ) .",
    "however , if magnetic pressure were dominant ( e.g. @xmath107 ) , then @xmath108 ( @xmath103 @xmath87 , @xmath109 @xmath87 , @xmath110 @xmath106 @xmath87 ) .",
    "the extent to which @xmath74 differs form zero in clusters could depend on how close to a radio source core the rm is measured as one would indeed expect @xmath75 far away from radio jets . as better spatial coverage of both fr and synchrotron constraints become available for jets , the use of plots such as those of fig.1 and 2 become more powerful .",
    "assuming plasma neutrality , we have generalized the calculation of fr for a neutral plasma containing electrons , positrons , and ions .",
    "positrons contribute equally and oppositely to electrons under the approximations considered .",
    "thus as the ratio of positrons to electrons @xmath74 increases from 0 to 1 , the fr weakens for a given line of sight magnetic field and density .",
    "correspondingly , for a given rm , a larger value of @xmath74 would imply a field strength and or electron density in excess of that inferred for @xmath75 .    while @xmath75 is often assumed for astrophysical plasmas , this assumption is not necessarily valid for jets and magnetospheres of black holes and neutron stars , where in fact it is of interest to independently determine @xmath74 .",
    "we have shown quantitatively the degeneracies in the space of parameters @xmath0 , @xmath74 , and @xmath1 and how they can be constrained . in principle ,",
    "if independent data on @xmath1 and @xmath0 can be obtained , then a given rm measurement can be used to obtain @xmath74 .",
    "the pursuit of @xmath74 has been particularly elusive in the context of agn jets and we hope that the calculations herein provide a tool toward this goal , and help motivate the pursuit of further data .",
