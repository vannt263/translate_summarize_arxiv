    "we select the sample attempting to tighten the selection criteria already used in the pioneer work of hudson ( 1993 ) and optical redshift survey ( ors , santiago et al .",
    "1995 ) , specifically , by adopting a complementary approach to the construction of an all - sky optical galaxy sample .",
    "in particular , we use , as photometric selection parameter , the total blue magnitudes , homogeneously transformed into the standard system of the rc3 catalogue and corrected for galactic extinction , internal extinction and k - dimming .    though being limited to a depth of 6000 km / s , the nog covers interesting regions of galaxy and mass overdensities of the local universe , such as the `` great attractor '' region and the perseus - pisces supercluster .",
    "compared to previous all - sky optical and iras galaxy samples ( e.g. the ors , the iras 1.2 jy by fisher et al .",
    "1995 , the pscz by saunders et al .",
    "1999 ) , the nog provides a denser sampling of the galaxy density field in the nearby universe .",
    "nog contains 11% more galaxies than the ors limited to 6000 km / s and 35% more galaxies than the pscz limited to the same depth , although it covers about 3/4 of the solid angle covered by the pscz .",
    "besides , nog delineates overdensity regions with a greater contrast than iras samples do .",
    "however , the high - density sampling rate , achieved by maximizing the sky coverage and limiting the sample depth , is counteracted by systematic effects arising from the cutoffs in the selection parameters or non - uniformities in the original catalogs .",
    "so we have tried to correct and minimize these biases testing the sample completeness by means of a count - magnitude analysis and deriving the appropriate luminosity and redshift selection functions .",
    "we find that the nog is intrinsically complete down to its limiting magnitude b=14 mag .",
    "moreover , it has a good completeness in redshift ( @xmath398% ) ( see fig .",
    "1 ) .    we have evaluated the schechter luminosity function for the whole sample and for different morphological types ( see marinoni et al .",
    "1999 for preliminary results )",
    "since we are interested in describing the galaxy density field also on small physical scales , we identify galaxy systems in the nog in order to remove non linearities on small scales in the peculiar velocity field and also study clustering properties and statistics .",
    "this has been done ( giuricin et al . 1999 ) by means of the hierarchical method and percolation _ friends of friends _ method .",
    "we obtain two homogeneous catalogs of loose groups which turn out to be substantially consistent .",
    "most of the nog galaxies ( @xmath360% ) are found to be members of galaxy pairs ( @xmath3580 for a total of @xmath315% of the galaxies ) or groups with at least three members ( @xmath3500 groups comprising @xmath345% of the galaxies ) .",
    "about 40% of the galaxies are left ungrouped ( field galaxies ) .",
    "containing about 500 groups with at least three members , they are among the largest catalogs of groups presently available in the literature .    furthermore , we have evaluated the schechter luminosity function for field galaxies , group members , and for different morphological types ( see marinoni et al .",
    "1999 for preliminary results ) .",
    "the problem of reconstructing the density fluctuation @xmath4 is connected with finding the best transformation scheme for _ diluting _ the point distribution into a continuous density field reducing the flux - limited effects and shot noise problems .",
    "we address all these issues smoothing with a normalized gaussian filter characterized by a smoothing length which is a properly defined increasing function of distance .",
    "moreover , we assign each galaxy a weight given by the inverse of the sample selection function in order to well calibrate the median value of the density ( see marinoni et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "the specific features of the galaxy distribution field are shown in figure 2 where we plot the surface contours of the 3d galaxy density contrast @xmath5 using a small and a large smoothing length ( respectively @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) .",
    "it is clear how nog can constrain the shape and dimensionality of high - amplitude , nearby structures as the so - called supergalactic plane .",
    "one s first visual impression is the irregularity in the the shapes of the major structures and the first - order symmetry between high- and low - density regions .",
    "given its large sky coverage , its high - density sampling , the identification of galaxy systems and real - space distance information , the nog is well suited for mapping the cosmography of the nearby universe , studying the clustering properties and tracing the optical galaxy density field ( also on small scales ) to be compared with the iras galaxy density field .",
    "exploring in detail the nature of the 3d galaxy distribution will provide us with invaluable qualitative cosmographical information about the topology and morphology of the local overdensities but also will allow us to investigate on the z=0 cosmology , greatly increasing our quantitative understanding of physical parameters that constrain the evolution of structures and their clustering properties .",
    "an important issue in the field of observational cosmology is the possible existence of biasing in the galaxy distribution relatively to the matter .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that besides depending on position and scale , the amount of bias should be connected to some intrinsic galaxian property .",
    "thus , the comparison of the relative distribution or morphological segregation of different types of galaxies , for which nog provide a detailed classification , will help us in constraining different theories for structure formation and evolution .",
    "moreover its nearly full - sky nature and the large variety in galaxy content make the nog ideal also for more specific tasks as the deconvolution of environmental effects from the properties and evolution history of the galaxies ."
