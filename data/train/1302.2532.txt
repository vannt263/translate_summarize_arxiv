    "the problem of finding analytic ( polynomial ) solutions of linear differential equations has lost some of its interest in recent years .",
    "the lack of interest is mainly due to the vast development of numerical methods and the fact that much of their study has been superseded by more general work based on the theory of lie algebra @xcite .",
    "recently , the interest of analytic ( polynomial ) solutions has been renewed by the analysis of confined and un - confined quantum systems and also by the search of closed - form solutions to ( schrdinger - type ) differential equations with polynomial coefficients @xcite .",
    "a reason for such interest is that in many problems in quantum mechanics , especially those arising from schrdinger s equation after the separation of the asymptotic - behaviour factor of the wave function , there remains a polynomial - type factor in the solution @xcite .",
    "one can further argue that analytic ( polynomial ) solutions provide a deeper quantitative insight into the physical model under investigation and in many cases makes the conceptual understanding of physics straightforward and sometimes intuitive @xcite .",
    "moreover , these solutions ( if they are available ) are valuable tools for checking and improving numerical methods introduced for solving complicated physical systems @xcite . 0.1true in in the present work we study the exact and approximate solutions of the schrdinger equation with decatic polynomial potential @xcite @xmath2 the importance of this type of even - power potentials follows from its relevance to different models of charmonium system @xcite and its connection with the analysis of anharmonic and double - well oscillators @xcite .",
    "we show under certain relations between the potential parameters @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 , we have exact solutions for the schrdinger equation , in the sense that @xmath8 and @xmath9 are completely determined .",
    "these relations are expressed in terms of energy - dependent polynomials that satisfies a four - term recurrence relation .",
    "we show further that these polynomials generate the corresponding eigenfunctions .",
    "our approach depends on analysing the analytic ( polynomial - type ) solutions of a second - order differential equation @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 , for all @xmath13 , are constants independent of the variable @xmath14 .",
    "thereby , we give the necessary and sufficient conditions for its polynomial solutions @xmath15 . in the second part of the present study , we introduce the asymptotic iteration method @xcite to obtain accurate approximate solutions for the decatic potential with arbitrary values of the potential parameters . in section",
    "ii , we set up the schrdinger equation for the decatic - power potential and we show it reduces to a differential equation of a type similar to equation . in section iii , we provides both the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of polynomial solutions of the ( general ) linear differential equation . in section iv",
    ", we examine the exact and approximate solutions of decatic potential and report some numerical results illustrate the usefulness of our approach where we compare our results with the existing literature .",
    "in this section , we consider the one - dimensional schrdinger equation @xmath16where @xmath17 , and @xmath7 are real constants with @xmath1 .",
    "assume the solution has the form @xmath18 substituting this expression into equation gives a second - order linear differential equation for @xmath19 as @xmath20 without loss of generality , we may assume , for the nodeless eigenstate @xmath21 , that @xmath22 . in which case , equation reduces to riccati s equation @xmath23    ( @xcite , page 474 ) by the symbol @xmath24 $ ] , where @xmath25 is a polynomial of even - degree , we shall mean the polynomial part of the expansion of @xmath26 in a series of descending integral powers of @xmath14 .",

    "in this section , we study a class of differential equations that generalized equation and we establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of polynomial solutions .    [ conds ] the necessary condition for the existence of polynomial solutions of the differential equation @xmath33 where @xmath34 and at least one of the coefficients @xmath35 is different from zero , is @xmath36 while the sufficient condition is given by the solution of the following system of linear equations @xmath37 where @xmath38    in particular , for a zero - degree polynomial solution of the differential equation the sufficient and necessary conditions are @xmath39 while for a first - degree polynomial solution of equation , we must have @xmath40 in addition to vanishing the four @xmath41-determinants @xmath42 for a second - degree polynomial solution , we must have @xmath43 in addition to the vanishing of the four @xmath44-determinants @xmath45 similar conditions follows for higher order of polynomial solutions .",
    "the first few polynomial solutions are given explicitly by @xmath46 0.1true in this theorem can be proved either by means of the frobenius series solution of ordinary differential equations or using the asymptotic iteration method @xcite .",
    "for the existence of polynomial solutions of the differential equation , it is clear from the criterion that the parameters @xmath47 and @xmath6 must be related through the equation @xmath48 there is an important consequence of this criterion that _ none _ of the following decatic polynomials @xmath49 have analytic solutions of the form with @xmath19 is a polynomial - type expression . indeed , we can claim out of this criterion that none of these potentials is a quasi - exactly solvable model @xcite and we have to rely on perturbation or approximation methods to obtain the necessary information about the discrete spectrum of these potentials as is usually used in the literature ( e.g. @xcite ) . in the following ,",
    "we shall focus on studying the decatic potentials using theorem [ conds ] to obtain the necessary conditions on the potential parameters for exact solutions followed by the application of the asymptotic iteration method to analyse the discrete spectrum for arbitrary values of the potential parameters .      for the necessary condition for even - degree polynomial solutions of schrdinger equation we have , by means of equation that @xmath50 while for the sufficient condition we deduce , by means of equations - , that @xmath51 where the polynomials @xmath52 satisfies the four - term recurrence relation @xmath53 initiated with @xmath54 .",
