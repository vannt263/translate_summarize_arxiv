    ", experiments on the superfluid - insulator ( si ) transitions of such bosonic atoms in two - dimensional ( 2d ) optical lattices @xcite is found to agree with predictions of theoretical studies of the bose - hubbard model quite accurately @xcite .",
    "more recently , several experiments have successfully generated time- or space- dependent effective vector potentials for neutral bosons .",
    "such synthetic vector potentials are created by generating temporally or spatially dependent optical coupling between the internal states of these bosonic atoms @xcite .",
    "we note that this experimental technique involves production of a specific effective vector potential for the atoms and hence corresponds to a fixed gauge . in the simplest experimental setup ,",
    "these vector potentials are typically chosen to represent a constant magnetic field in the asymmetric gauge . however , a few experiments have also generated vector potentials which correspond to spatially varying synthetic magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "several theoretical studies have been carried on the properties of the bosons in deep optical lattice in the presence of a constant synthetic magnetic field @xcite . in particular , the si phase boundary has been computed both using mean - field theory @xcite and excitation energy calculation which relies on a perturbative expansion in the hopping parameter @xcite .",
    "more recently , experimentally relevant issues , such as the momentum distribution of the bosons in the mott phase , the critical theory of the si transition , and the nature of the superfluid ground states and collective modes near criticality have also been addressed @xcite . however , in spite of the possibility of direct experimental realization @xcite , the phase diagram of these bosons in the presence of a spatially dependent magnetic field has not been theoretically investigated .    in this work",
    ", we present a theory of the si transition for ultracold bosons in a 2d square optical lattice with commensurate filling @xmath5 and in the presence of a periodic synthetic vector potential given by @xmath6 with @xmath7 , where @xmath1 is the period of the vector potential , @xmath2 is an integer , @xmath3 is the lattice spacing , and @xmath8 is the maximum value of the vector potential on any lattice site . at the outset , we introduce a dimensionless number @xmath9 , ( where @xmath10 is the effective charge of the bosons @xcite , @xmath11 is the speed of light , and @xmath12 is the planck s constant ) which will be used in the rest of this work to characterize the strength of the vector potential .",
    "we first consider the problem of non - interacting bosons in a lattice in the presence of such a periodic vector potential and show that the corresponding single particle schrdinger equation can be reduced to a one - dimensional harper - like equation @xcite .",

    "<S> we study mott phases and superfluid - insulator ( si ) transitions of ultracold bosonic atoms in a two - dimensional square optical lattice at commensurate filling and in the presence of a synthetic periodic vector potential characterized by a strength @xmath0 and a period @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is an integer and @xmath3 is the lattice spacing . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the schrdinger equation for the non - interacting bosons in the presence of such a periodic vector potential can be reduced to an one - dimensional harper - like equation which yields @xmath2 energy bands . </S>",
    "<S> the lowest of these bands have either single or double minima whose position within the magnetic brillouin zone can be tuned by varying @xmath0 for a given @xmath2 . using these energies and a strong - coupling expansion technique , we compute the phase diagram of these bosons in the presence of a deep optical lattice . </S>",
    "<S> we chart out the @xmath0 and @xmath2 dependence of the momentum distribution of the bosons in the mott phases near the si transitions and demonstrate that the bosons exhibit several re - entrant field - induced si transitions for any fixed period @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we also predict that the superfluid density of the resultant superfluid state near such a si transition has a periodicity @xmath2 ( @xmath4 ) in real space for odd ( even ) @xmath2 and suggest experiments to test our theory . </S>"
