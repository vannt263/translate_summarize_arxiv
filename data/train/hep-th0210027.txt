    "even though this hypothesis can be considered as roughly valid in the classical domain , it is clearly broken by the quantum mechanical behavior .",
    "it has indeed been pointed out by feynman ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) that the typical paths of quantum mechanics are continuous but non - differentiable . in the present paper",

    "+ one of the fundamental reasons for jumping to a scale - relativistic description of nature is to increase the generality of the first principles retained .",
    "einstein s principle of relativity relies on the assumption that coordinates are a priori differentiable .",
    "it is therefore not fully general , since it applies to coordinate transformations that are continuous and , at least two times , differentiable .",
    "the aim of the theory of scale relativity is to bring to light laws and structures that would be the manifestation of more general transformations , namely , continuous ones , either differentiable or not .",
    "the standard `` general relativistic '' theory will be automatically recovered as the special differentiable case , while new effects would be expected from the non - differentiable part .",
    "+ giving up the assumption of differentiability has important physical consequences : one can show @xcite that spaces of topological dimension @xmath2 , which are continuous but non - differentiable , are characterized by a @xmath2 measure which becomes explicitly dependent on the resolution ( i.e. , the observation scale ) @xmath3 at which it is considered and tends to infinity when the resolution interval @xmath3 tends to zero .",
    "therefore , a non - differentiable space - time continuum is necessarily fractal , in the general meaning given to this word by mandelbrot @xcite , who thus means , not only self - similar , but explicitly scale - dependent in the more general way .",
    "this statement naturally leads to the proposal of a geometric tool adapted to construct a theory based on such premises , namely , a fractal space - time ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "such an explicit and fundamental dependence of physical laws on the internal `` resolution '' scales leads to constrain the new scale laws ( that need to be constructed ) by a `` principle of scale relativity '' @xcite .",
    "this principle extends to scale transformations ( i.e. , contractions and dilations of resolutions ) the galileo - einstein principle of relativity , that was up to now applied only to displacements and motion .",
    "this allows to include the resolutions in the definition of the state of the reference system and to require scale covariance of the equations of physics under scale transformations .",
    "a main consequence is that the geodesics of such a non - differentiable space - time are themselves fractal and in infinite number between any two points .",
    "this strongly suggests that the description could borrow some tools from the mathematical formalism of statistics , i.e. , will provide a probabilistic interpretation , therefore naturally extending the realm of quantum behaviour to a larger spectrum of available scales .",
