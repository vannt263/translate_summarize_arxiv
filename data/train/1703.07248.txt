    "second , the probe pulse averages over an increasingly large time range of @xmath91 . this is most clearly reflected in the maximum value of the reconstruction , which is reduced for larger pulse width .      for the discussion of single frequency optical conductivities we will concentrate on the experimentally motivated type - i and type - ii probe pulses and define @xmath146 , which picks out the diagonal contribution @xmath181 of the general two frequencies dependent conductivity .",
    "it is convenient to first consider the limit @xmath182 .",
    "this limit corresponds to a delta - function ( derivative of a delta - function ) of the vector potential @xmath183 ( @xmath184 ) for type - ii ( type - i ) probe - pulses .",

    "one of the hallmarks of a superconductor is an infinitely lived super current as a response to an electric field pulse . in equilibrium",

    "if probed by an electric field pulse @xmath189 , of a transient superconductor with life time @xmath112 this reflects in a downturn of the apparent @xmath190 divergence back to zero at a frequency scale @xmath191.@xcite    however , in experiments the probe pulses change the vector potential only on a finite time scale ( unlike the experimentally impractical @xmath58 field pulse discussed above ) .",
    "if now a pulse in @xmath192 instead of @xmath144 is applied ( as is the case in the short pulse @xmath182 limit of the type - ii pulse ) , the supercurrent is canceled almost instantly by a current with same magnitude but opposite direction after the vector potential is abruptly switched off again .",
    "the asymptotic long time behavior of the system is not probed and ( as in equilibrium ) one can show that the imaginary part of the conductivity @xmath193 shows a @xmath190 divergence with prefactor @xmath194 in the adiabatic limit .",

    "if the probe is applied before the gap ramp @xmath203 the low frequency behavior of the conductivity probes the future behavior of the gap .",
    "thus the low - frequency behavior shows a hint of a suppression in the real part of the conductivity , if build - up of the gap is still to come , while it looks almost perfectly like the equilibrium normal conducting state if the ramp is in the past of the probe .",
    "this effect is the more pronounced the more non - adiabatic the ramp is .",
    "the in - gap contributions , attributed to the non - equilibrium nature of the system , makes a determination of the instantaneous gap @xmath91 form the real part of the conductivity difficult .     for both of the two values of @xmath198 ( upper panel ) and @xmath204 ( lower panel ) .",
    "]    we end our discussion of short probe pulses by shifting our interest to the type - i probe pulse , which in this limit implies a vector potential proportional to the derivative of a delta - function @xmath205 .",
    "a similar equilibrium analysis as done above for the type - ii probe reveals that in the adiabatic limit the type - ii probe can be used to determine @xmath206 via the imaginary part of the conductivity .",
    "finally we show the finite frequency part of the conductivity resulting from a type - i pulses ( and also compare to the conductivity which would be found by the proposed type - ii pulses ) .    in figs .",
    "[ fig : finwidthi ] and [ fig : finwidthii ] we compare the measured optical conductivities @xmath146 for experimentally relevant type - i and proposed type - ii probe pulses in the superconducting as well as the charge density wave state .",

    "there is a pronounced enhancement of the edge at @xmath207 as the gap builds up .     for a type - i probe pulse for @xmath133 with @xmath101 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 and @xmath175 ( corresponding to the left panels of fig .",

    "the equilibrium intuition works very well , with a gradual build up and vanishing of the optical gap in the conductivity .",
    "however , in the rapidly evolving case the reconstruction can deviate significantly from this intuition ( the conductivity becoming negative or not resembling in anyway the equilibrium result ) .",
    "but for @xmath170 with @xmath101 , @xmath134 and @xmath171 ( left panels ) and @xmath172 ( right panels ) and showing only results for the superconducting state .",
    "]    the reason for these deviations from equilibrium is two fold .",
    "there is a trivial contribution from the finite width of the probe pulse which measures the varying gap over a large time range .",
    "this contribution would yield differences to the equilibrium optical conductivity even in the adiabatic limit and can be corrected , also experimentally , by introducing delay lines between pump and probe pulse as documented in refs . .",
    "we are more interested in the second contribution which arises even for very short probe pulses and is linked to the intrinsic non - equilibrium state studied .",
    "we checked , that the negative feature in the conductivity arising even in the short pulse limit ( upper right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : finwidthiii ] ) can ( at least partially ) be traced back to the fact that the fourier transform with respect to a single variable of a two - time function is not well defined .",
    "the additional lag of the current with respect to the probe field leads to a phase difference , which mixes real and imaginary part of the fourier transforms @xmath209 and @xmath210 defining the optical conductivity .",
    "this admixture of imaginary part contributions to the real part leads to the conductivity being negative even in the short probe pulse limit .",
    "to summarize , we have presented a theory of the response of non - equilibrium superconducting and charge density wave systems to weak applied `` probe '' electric fields .",
    "the non - equilibrium state was introduced phenomenologically  we simply assumed a time varying order parameter @xmath91 .",
    "our treatment was also based on a time - dependent mean field ( bcs ) approximation , supplemented by relaxation via a weakly coupled fermionic reservior .",
    "note that in this approximation the gap function and the order parameter are identical and for the most part we have used the terms interchangeably , except that in figures  [ samplecond ] and  [ simulateexpta2_2 ] we use a phenomenological ansatz to investigate some features of the case in which phase fluctuations reduce the superfluid stiffness but not the gap .",
    "these simplifications were made to enable a focus on the issue of main interest , namely the observable features of the response to an applied probe field .",
    "the extension of our work to more general theoretical treatments of a nonequilibrium state is straightforward and would be of interest .",
    "our work was motivated by the extensive and growing literature on optical studies of transient behavior of electronic orders , and in particular by the discussion of orenstein and dodge @xcite of the pitfalls inherent in the common experimental practice of collapsing the theoretically expected two - frequency conductivity to a function of a single frequency .",
    "we investigate time - domain signatures of the important physics , in particular identifying a characteristic difference in the time domain responses of transient superconducting and charge density wave states : the initial current response in the two cases is opposite with respect to normal state current response .",
    "we also show how appropriate tailoring of pulses can enhance the signatures of the key physics of transient states , in particular revealing the instantaneous superfluid stiffness .",
    "this work opens the route towards many intriguing further investigations .",
    "one obvious extension is to describe the dynamical melting of charge density wave order in recent terahertz light field experiments.@xcite and dynamical destruction of mott insulators . on the theoretical side ,",
    "relaxing the time - dependent bcs assumption made here is an important direction .",
    "in particular we have assumed that at all relevant times the phase of the superconducting order parameter is spatially uniform and that the phase stiffness is large enough that the standard linear response to vector potential arguments apply .",
    "relaxing these assumptions by incorporating random initial phases and the associated gradual annealing of the phase difference over time after the superconducting quench is of interest , as is considering the potential for nonlinear response at early times when the superconducting order parameter is small .",
