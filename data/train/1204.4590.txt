    "suppose that @xmath2 is a positive superharmonic function defined in an open , bounded subset @xmath4 of @xmath10 , i.e. @xmath23 two issues which have received a considerable amount of attention in the literature are :      see , for example , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and the references therein .",
    "we wish to highlight two aspects of the philosophy that has emerged from these studies .",
    "first , granted a certain degree of reasonableness of the underlying domain , for superharmonic functions , positivity always entails a quantitative version of itself , in the form of the estimate @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a constant depending on @xmath2 and @xmath4 , for some exponent @xmath28 independent of @xmath2 . here and elsewhere , for an arbitrary set @xmath1 , we have denoted by @xmath29 the ( euclidean ) distance to its boundary , i.e. , @xmath30    the second aspect alluded to above is that there is a common integrability threshold for the entire class of positive superharmonic functions in the sense that @xmath31 for some integrability exponent @xmath32 independent of the positive superharmonic function @xmath2 in @xmath4 .",
    "the specific nature of the exponents @xmath33 and @xmath34 is dictated by the degree of regularity exhibited by @xmath4 .",
    "for example , has been proved for @xmath35 in a suitable subclass of the class of domains satisfying a uniform interior ball condition which , in turn , contains the class of bounded @xmath13 domains , by kuran in @xcite , and for bounded planar jordan domains with a dini - continuous boundary by kuran and schiff in @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the lower bounds for the green function established in @xcite for lipschitz domains also lead to estimates of the type , typically for exponents larger than one .",
    "as far as is concerned , in the case when @xmath1 is a bounded @xmath36 domain , armitage @xcite , @xcite has proved that holds for any positive superharmonic function @xmath2 in @xmath4 , granted that @xmath37 .",
    "this result has been subsequently extended by maeda and suzuki in @xcite to the class of bounded lipschitz domains for a range of @xmath38 s which depends on the lipschitz constant of the domain in question , in such a way that @xmath39 as the domain is progressively closer and closer to being of class @xmath9 ( i.e. , as the lipschitz constant approaches zero ) .",
    "further refinements of this result , in the class of john domains and hlder domains ( in which scenario @xmath38 is typically small ) , have been studied , respectively by aikawa in @xcite and by stegenga and ullrich in @xcite .      in this paper",
    "we are concerned with the validity of for _ negative _ values of the integrability exponents , in the case when @xmath2 is a positive function with @xmath40 in @xmath4 .",
    "a case in point is the solution of the saint venant problem when @xmath4 is a bounded open set ( see  [ sect:2 ] ) .",
    "much of our analysis will apply in the more general setting where we assume that @xmath41 , with @xmath42 being a positive dimensional constant . ]",
    ", e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) @xmath43 u=0\\,\\,\\,\\,\\mbox { on } \\,\\,\\partial\\omega , \\end{array } \\right.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the question which makes the object of our study is that of determining the range of values of the parameter @xmath7 for which an estimate of the form @xmath44 holds , under various conditions on @xmath4 and demands on the nature of the constant @xmath8 .",
    "cases of special interest include the class of nontangentially accessible domains satisfying an inner cone condition ( which includes the class of lipschitz domain ) in @xmath10 , polygonal domains in @xmath45 , polyhedral domains in @xmath12 , as well as piecewise smooth domains with conical and cuspidal singularities .",
    "since @xmath46 is entirely determined by the domain @xmath4 and the parameter @xmath47 , we shall occasionally refer to this number as the `` @xmath47-integral of @xmath4 . ''",
    "aside from its relevance in potential theory , the problem plays a significant role in elasticity theory .",
    "for example , the torsional rigidity coefficient of @xmath4 , originally defined as @xmath48 turns out to be @xmath49 where @xmath2 is the solution of ( cf .  the discussion in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "our interest in the estimate was originally motivated by problems in harmonic analysis concerning sublevel set estimates for a real - valued , strictly convex function of class @xmath13 defined in an open , convex set @xmath1 .",
    "( it is thus also related to the behaviour of oscillatory integrals ; cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite . )",
    "it this vein , we recall that it has been shown in @xcite that there exists a finite dimensional constant @xmath50 with the property that , with @xmath51 denoting the lebesgue measure in place of @xmath51 . ] of a lebesgue measurable set @xmath52 , latexmath:[\\ ] ] in such a scenario ,",
    "and then yield @xmath1088 given that @xmath168 small forces @xmath633 small .",
    "this takes care of the lower bound for @xmath1049 in .",
    "there remains to establish the upper bound for @xmath1049 in .",
    "keeping in mind and recalling that @xmath1049 vanishes on @xmath1042 , the mean value theorem then allows us to estimate @xmath1089 where @xmath1090 .",
    "this concludes the proof of the lemma .    moving on ,",
    "we wish to note that the smoothness requirements for the function @xmath1049 from lemma  [ quanthopf ] are automatically satisfied in the case in which @xmath4 is a bounded domain of class @xmath350 for some @xmath286 and the function @xmath1049 is a classical solution of the boundary value problem @xmath1091 where @xmath1044 is a second - order , elliptic , nondivergence - form differential operator with smooth coefficients , and @xmath1092 is a smooth scalar function , in @xmath198 .",
    "indeed , in this context the function @xmath1049 actually satisfies @xmath1093 .",
    "such a regularity result is well - known ; see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* thorme  i , p.42 ) ( cf .",
    "also @xcite , or the discussion in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter  7 ) ) .",
    "the last step in the proof of has to do with localisation . in this vein ,",
    "recall that if @xmath393 is a @xmath13 boundaryless manifold of ( real ) dimension @xmath65 equipped with a @xmath9 riemannian metric tensor @xmath1094 then , in local coordinates , the laplace - beltrami operator @xmath1095 on @xmath393 is given by @xmath1096 where @xmath1097 is the inverse of the matrix @xmath1098 and @xmath1099 .",
    "the relevant issue for us here is that such a differential operator falls within the class of operators considered in lemma  [ quanthopf ] . in particular",
