    "<S> we propose a simple method that allows , in one dimension , to solve exactly a wide class of classical stochastic many - body systems far from equilibrium . for the sake of illustration and without loss of generality </S>",
    "<S> , we focus on a model that describes the asymmetric diffusion of hard core particles in the presence of an external source and instantaneous annihilation . starting from a master equation formulation of the problem </S>",
    "<S> we show that the density and multi - point correlation functions obey a closed set of integro - differential equations which in turn can be solved numerically and/or analytically .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , nonequilibrium statistical mechanics in low dimensional systems has attracted much interest @xcite . whereas classical statistical mechanics has a well established body of concepts and tools to deal with systems at or near thermodynamic equilibrium , </S>",
    "<S> the situation is less satisfactory for far from equilibrium systems . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical understanding of classical stochastic many - body systems where both purely diffusive motion ( due for example to static disorder , phonons , etc . ) and reactions ( for example fusion , annihilation , coagulation , etc . , where the number of particles is not conserved ) take place simultaneously is relevant to a wide class of phenomena in physics , biology , economics , a.s.o . </S>",
    "<S> + in view of this , we have chosen to investigate an important class of models describing diffusion - limited reactions ( for recent reviews see @xcite ) . while it has long been recognized that the mean field approach is not applicable in one and two dimensions , it is only recently that much progress has been achieved in the description of the anomalous kinetics of low dimensional systems . </S>",
    "<S> some open problems in this field are reminiscent of those studied intensively in the field of strongly correlated low - dimensional systems . </S>",
    "<S> hence , one might hope to use with advantage the powerful tools devised in the latter . </S>",
    "<S> + the last decade has witnessed new developments in the master equation approach . </S>",
    "<S> the markov generator of the stochastic time evolution for the probability distribution can be interpreted as the hamiltonian of quantum spin chains ( with quantum group symmetries ) or alternatively of fermion or boson many - body systems with interaction terms . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics is then coded in an imaginary time schrdinger equation or alternatively formulated as an euclidean field theory . </S>",
    "<S> the most formal approach expresses the hamiltonian as a sum of generators of an hecke algebra and , through baxterization , associates an integrable vertex model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the free fermion models considered by grynberg et _ al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , schtz and others ( see @xcite and references therein ) can be viewed as special cases of the above with a grading of the yang - baxter algebra . as is known in the field of integrable models </S>",
    "<S> , it is in general extremely difficult , if not impossible , to extract the correlations from the bethe `` wave functions '' , even in their algebraic form ( see for example @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is unfortunate because conceptually as well as experimentally ( see @xcite and references therein ) , the correlations coded in these `` wave functions '' are the most relevant quantities . </S>",
    "<S> we should mention at this point however that there is one successful application of ideas developed in the field of strongly correlated systems , namely the extension of the numerical density matrix renormalization group to nonequilibrium statistical mechanics in one dimension@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + on the analytical front , a powerful method is that developed by cardy and collaborators @xcite . assuming that the system is in a low - density regime , these authors rewrite the markov generator of the stochastic time evolution as a bosonic hamiltonian which in turn can be treated by field theory and renormalization group techniques in arbitrary dimension . for certain models , </S>",
    "<S> it is even possible to evaluate exactly the beta functions for the coupling constants @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is a first indication that the underlying mathematical structure is substantially simpler than that of the quantum many - body problem . to our knowledge , this observation as well as its implications do not seem to have drawn much attention in the literature . + </S>",
    "<S> despite the progress achieved in the last decade , there are still many open or poorly understood problems , even in one dimension : the multi - species and the epidemic models , the propagation of catalytic shock waves , etc . in response to these challenges , we were lead to consider a fermionic field theory formulation of the master equation for dense systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while inquiring about the possible application of the renormalization group to the fermion field theory , we realized that it is possible to express the density and correlation functions as solutions of a closed set of integro - differential equations . </S>",
    "<S> these in turn can be solved exactly numerically and/or analytically . </S>",
    "<S> this is an unexpected and remarkable result , especially in view of the large amount of work that has been performed in the field using sophisticated methods . </S>",
    "<S> our approach in contrast is simple and elementary . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we would like to report on this rather unanticipated observation . + for illustrative purposes , we focus here on an extended lushnikov model @xcite that describes the ( asymmetric ) diffusion of particles in the presence of bilinear source and annihilation . </S>",
    "<S> certainly , such a model does not constitute a protoptype for classical stochastic many - body systems as does the ising model for phase transitions : the variety of phenomena to be described in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics is much too rich to be coded in a single model . </S>",
    "<S> though we are perfectly aware of the numerous potential applications that our method provides , we will refrain from mentioning them here due to a lack of space and refer the reader to elsewhere ( e.g. @xcite ) . + consider a lattice of @xmath0 ( @xmath1 even ) sites with periodic boundary conditions on which classical particles with hard core can diffuse with rates @xmath2 to the left and @xmath3 to the right , respectively . on encounter , </S>",

    "<S> the above dynamics is supplemented with the initial conditions @xmath12 ( see below ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is convenient to introduce the left vacuum @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> conservation of probability implies then @xmath14 , while expectation values are linear in the kets @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the models that have been solved previously correspond to @xmath16 ( see e.g.@xcite ) , i.e. , to quadratic hamiltonians . </S>",
    "<S> below , we show that the hamiltonian @xmath17 can be solved exactly for @xmath18 by elementary means , i.e. , that the density and two - point ( multi - point ) correlation function(s ) can be computed exactly even though the hamiltonian is non - quadratic . </S>",

    "<S> this remarkable property can be generalized to higher order correlation functions . due to the conservation of probability , an analog of the wick theorem applies and all multipoint correlation functions can be computed . for simplicity </S>",
    "<S> s sake we consider in the following a lattice initially full , i.e. , @xmath36 ( for the general case see @xcite ) and obtain the integro - differential equation for @xmath31 @xmath37 with the initial condition @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> this equation with the appropriate boundary conditions fully solves the problem of the time evolution of the density and correlation function . indeed , introducing the help functions @xmath39 ( for @xmath40 integer ) , the density can be written as @xmath41 while it is convenient to introduce the function @xmath42 to express the ( connected ) two - point correlation function as @xmath43\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the help functions @xmath44 have the integral representation @xmath45 where @xmath46 denote the modified bessel functions of imaginary argument , and @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noting that @xmath48 and @xmath49 are obtained self - consistently while the higher order functions @xmath44 ( @xmath50 ) follow from simple integration . </S>",
    "<S> notice that at @xmath51 , we recover the results obtained in @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ 15])-([17 ] ) indicate that the @xmath63 term is irrelevant in the long time limit in the sense that it does not renormalize the exponent of the algebraic ( in the absence of source ) or of the subdominant - algebraic ( in the presence of source ) decay . </S>",
    "<S> such a behavior had been observed numerically ( in the absence of source ) in reference @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the correlation times are however renormalized . </S>",
    "<S> + the extension of our method to deal with epidemic models and many species is indeed possible . </S>",
    "<S> local sources or sinks as well as boundary ( initial state ) terms associated with local operators in the hamiltonian formulation can also be dealt with whenever the jordan - wigner phase can be made to cancel . </S>",
