    "the presence and origin of complex organic molecules in protostellar regions and their possible incorporation in protoplanetary disks is an active topic of research .",
    "ch@xmath0 is proposed to be a starting point of a rich chemistry , especially when uv photons are present @xcite . in particular ch@xmath0",
    "is believed to play a key role in the formation process of prebiotic molecules @xcite .",
    "ch@xmath0 is less well studied in interstellar and circumstellar media compared to other small organic molecules because ch@xmath0 has no permanent dipole moment and therefore can not be observed by pure rotational transitions at radio wavelengths .",
    "solid ch@xmath0 was first detected through its bending mode at 7.67 @xmath2 m from the ground by @xcite , and with the infrared space observatory short wavelength spectrometer ( iso - sws ) by @xcite toward a few high - mass sources .",
    "tentative claims have been made toward some other objects including low - mass protostars , but are inconclusive because of the low s / n ratio of these data @xcite .",
    "solid ch@xmath0 has also been detected from the ground through its stretching mode at 3.3 @xmath2 m , but only toward the brightest high mass sources due to problems in removing the many atmospheric lines in this spectral region @xcite .",
    "models predict ch@xmath0 to form rapidly on cool grains through successive hydrogenation of atomic c ; similarly h@xmath3o is formed through hydrogenation of atomic o @xcite .",
    "observations of ch@xmath0 hence provide insight into the basic principles of grain surface chemistry .",
    "compared to h@xmath3o the observed gas- and solid - state ch@xmath0 abundances are low ; reported ch@xmath0 abundances are typically a few percent with respect to h@xmath3o @xcite .",
    "this points to relatively low atomic c abundances at the time of ch@xmath0 formation , with most c already locked up in co as h readily reacts with c on surfaces @xcite .",
    "this is in agreement with the high ch@xmath7oh abundances in several lines of sight , formed by hydrogenation of co @xcite , and large co@xmath3 abundances , formed through oxidation of co or hydrogenated co. that these molecules are all formed through a similar process is corroborated by the profiles of solid co@xmath3 absorption bands , which usually show an intimate mixture of co@xmath3 , ch@xmath7oh and h@xmath3o in interstellar ices @xcite .",
    "if ch@xmath0 is formed efficiently through grain surface reactions as well , ch@xmath0 should be similarly mixed with h@xmath3o .",
    "observations of solid ch@xmath0 toward a few high mass young stellar objects ( ysos ) show that the ch@xmath0 absorption band profiles are broad and agree better with ch@xmath0 in a hydrogen bonding ice , h@xmath3o or ch@xmath7oh , than with a pure ch@xmath0 ice or ch@xmath0 mixed with co @xcite .",
    "this profile analysis does not , however , exclude ch@xmath0 formation from photoprocessing of ch@xmath7oh @xcite . in addition , because of the small sample in previous studies , it is unclear if these broad profiles are a universal feature .",
    "hence it can not be excluded that ch@xmath0 in some environments may form in the gas phase and subsequently freeze out .    because formation pathway efficiency depends on environment , another method for testing formation routes is through exploring the distribution of ch@xmath0 toward a large sample of objects of different ages , luminosities and ice column densities .",
    "in addition , correlations , or lack thereof , with other ice constituents may provide important clues to how the molecule is formed .",
    "if ch@xmath0 is formed through hydrogenation on grain surfaces in quiescent clouds , the ch@xmath0 abundance with respect to h@xmath3o should be fairly source independent since this mechanism mainly depends on the initial conditions of the cloud before the star forms , which seem to vary little between different star forming regions . because of the generality of this mechanism , the ch@xmath0 and h@xmath3o , and possibly co@xmath3 , column densities should correlate over a large range of different environments .",
    "this is also the prediction of several models where the solid ch@xmath0/h@xmath3o and ch@xmath0/co@xmath3 ratios in dark clouds vary little both as a function of time @xcite and distance into a cloud that has collapsed @xcite .",
    "in contrast , co , which is formed in the gas phase and subsequently frozen out , is predicted to only correlate with ch@xmath0 during certain time intervals .",
    "if ch@xmath0 instead forms in the gas phase , solid ch@xmath0 should be better correlated with solid co than with solid h@xmath3o and co@xmath3 , since pure ch@xmath0 freezes out and desorbs at similar temperatures to co ( fraser et al .",
    "submitted to @xmath8 , * ? ? ?",
    "finally , if ch@xmath0 forms by uv photoprocessing of ch@xmath7oh more ch@xmath0 would also be expected to form toward sources with stronger uv - fields i.e. higher mass objects .",
    "the objective of this study is to determine the ch@xmath0 abundances and distribution pattern toward a sample of low mass young stellar objects , varying in evolutionary stage and total ice column density .",
    "the distribution pattern and correlations with other ice constituents within the sample as well as comparison with high mass young stellar objects will be used to constrain the ch@xmath0 formation mechanism .",
    "this study is based on spectra acquired with the spitzer infrared spectrometer ( irs ) as part of our legacy program ` from molecular cores to protoplanetary disks ' ( @xmath1 ) , which provides a large sample ( 41 sources ) of infrared spectra of low mass star formation regions @xcite .",
    "in addition 11 sources are added from the gto program 2 for which ground based 3 - 5 @xmath2 m already exist @xcite .",
    "overviews of the h@xmath3o , co@xmath3 , ch@xmath7oh and other ice species in these data are found in boogert et al .",
    "( apj submitted , paper i ) and pontoppidan et al .",
    "( apj submitted , paper ii ) .",
    "the detection of solid ch@xmath0 toward one of the sources , hh46 irs , was published by @xcite .",
    "we have detected an absorption feature , which is attributed to solid ch@xmath0 , toward 25 out of 52 low mass ice sources found in this @xmath1 sample .",
    "the source sample consists of a combination of known low mass protostars and new protostars discovered by their spitzer irac and mips broad - band seds .",
    "spitzer / irs spectra were obtained as part of the @xmath1 legacy program ( pids 172 and 179 ) as well as a dedicated open time program ( pid 20604 ) and a few archival spectra observed as a part of the gto programs of houck et al . among the targets observed with the irs short - long ( sl ) module , 41 ice sources were identified from their spectra in the @xmath1 sample ( paper i ) .",
    "the gto sources are all associated with the ophiuchus cloud and were selected based on previous ice observations at 3 - 5@xmath2 m @xcite .",
    "the source sample of 25 low mass protostars presented here was selected from the 41 @xmath1 and 11 gto ice sources based solely on the existence of an absorption feature at 7.7 @xmath2 m , identified with solid ch@xmath0 ( table [ sources ] ) . due to the high sensitivity of the spitzer / irs , a large range of star formation stages are represented in the sample from very young ysos at the interface of the class 0/i stages ( e.g. b1-c ) to objects like rno 91 , identified as an inclined disk with a remnant envelope .",
    "it also includes very low luminosity objects ( vellos ) such as l1014 irs @xcite .",
    "more information about the evolutionary stages of the objects are reported in paper i.    the spitzer / irs spectra were reduced using the 2-dimensional basic calibrated data ( bcd ) spectral images , produced by the spitzer science center ( ssc ) pipeline version s13.2.0 , as a starting point .",
    "the low resolution modules , which are the relevant ones for the solid ch@xmath0 feature , were reduced in a similar way to ground - based spectra .",
    "first , the spectral and spatial dimensions were orthogonalized , and then the 2-dimensional images of the two nodding positions were subtracted in order to remove the extended emission .",
    "a fixed width extraction was performed and then the 1-dimensional spectra were averaged .",
    "subsequently the spectra were divided by spectra of the standard star hr 2194 , reduced in the same way , to correct for wavelength dependent slit losses .",
    "finally the spectra were multiplied along the flux scale in order to match spitzer / irac photometry .",
    "one source , ec 92 , was carefully extracted manually due to multiple other sources present in the slit .",
    "more details about the reduction and the complete mid - infrared spectra of the @xmath1 sources is presented in paper i. the ch@xmath0 7.7 @xmath2 m absorption feature falls within the range of the irs modules sl1 and sl2 . at these wavelengths the resolving power",
    "@xmath9 of irs is 65 or 0.12 @xmath2 m for sl1 and 125 or 0.06 @xmath2 m for sl2 ( irs data handbook ) .",
    "the plotted spectra are made up using data from the main orders of sl1 and sl2 , while the sl1 bonus order was only used to confirm detections .",
    "sl2 stops around 7.6 @xmath2 m so the peak of the ch@xmath0 absorption feature is always in sl1 .",
    "the part of the spectra from the sl2 module is hence mainly used to determine the continuum and in some cases the shape of a low wavelength wing .",
    "when comparing observations to laboratory spectra , the laboratory spectra are always convolved to the resolution of sl1 ( 0.12 @xmath2 m , sampled with two pixels per resolution element ) .",
    "iso - sws spectra of four high mass ysos are used for comparison between low mass and high mass protostars in this paper .",
    "the latest standard processed data ( spd ) pipeline version 10.1 products were taken from the iso archive and the detector scans were cleaned from cosmic ray hits and averaged .",
    "the final spectra do not show significant differences with respect to the data published in keane et al .",

    "the ch@xmath0 abundances with respect to h@xmath3o vary between 6 and 13% and in the latter group all ch@xmath0 abundances fall between 2 and 8% .",

    "the excess absorption ( 055% ) of the observed 7.7 @xmath2 m features in many of the astronomical objects is due to broader profiles than expected even for ch@xmath0 in a h@xmath3o rich ice .",

    "a comparison between these two sources and low mass sources from this sample shows that the same variation is present here ( fig .",
    "[ isocomp ] )  approximately 25% of the sources in this study have a clear blue wing , perhaps attributable to solid so@xmath3 . the maximum amounts of so@xmath3 present in the observed ices",

    "the solid so@xmath3 abundances then vary between 0.1 and 1.5% with respect to h@xmath3o .    in cases where the excess is similar on both sides of the ch@xmath0 absorption ,",
    "another source of the large widths of the features may be the choice of continuum ; the spline continuum was difficult to fit because the ch@xmath0 feature is generally shallow and overlapping with other , larger , features .",
    "it is possible that the wings toward several sources are not intrinsic , but a product of this fit .",
    "this is highlighted by a comparison between fig .",
    "[ contsp ] and fig [ tausp ] , which shows that the sources with clear continua also have thinner absorption features than the average .",
    "upper limits for solid ch@xmath0 were determined for the 27 sources without ch@xmath0 detections , in the sample of 52 low mass ice sources originally probed for ch@xmath0 , by estimating the maximum amount of a h@xmath3o : ch@xmath0 3:1 ice that could hide under the noise .",

    "all abundance upper limits below 30% are shown in figure 4 .",
    "only one ch@xmath0 upper limit , of @xmath153% , falls below the average abundance of 4.8% .",
    "the lack of detection in these 27 sources is hence probably due to the spectral quality and low fluxes of the objects rather than a lower amount of solid ch@xmath0 .",
    "the objects in this sample may vary significantly in temperature structure as well as other environmental factors .",
    "lack of correlations between molecular abundances may hence be due to either different formation pathways or differences in volatility .",
    "a lack of correlation between ch@xmath0 and molecules of different volatility does hence not exclude that they formed in a similar manner .",
    "in pure form ch@xmath0 has a similar volatility to co @xcite .",
    "if ch@xmath0 is mixed with h@xmath3o significant amounts can be trapped inside of the h@xmath3o ice , however , and then ch@xmath0 has an effective volatility closer to that of h@xmath3o and co@xmath3 .",
    "the column densities of solid h@xmath3o ( 26 detections ) and ch@xmath7oh ( 10 detections ) have been derived in paper i and solid co ( 13 ground based observations ) and co@xmath3 ( 25 detections ) in @xcite and paper ii for many of the ch@xmath0 sources .",

    "some correlation between column densities of ice species and with total column density is always expected , but fig .",

    "the correlations are significant at the 99% level with 23 and 24 degrees of freedom ( df ) respectively .",

    "the small number of co abundances , which are only available for 11 of the targets in this study , complicates interpreting the low correlation plots between co and ch@xmath0 . if only the sources for which co measurements exist are used to calculate the ch@xmath0co@xmath3 and ch@xmath0h@xmath3o correlations these are reduced to @xmath17=0.46 and 0.74 respectively .",
    "the stronger correlation between ch@xmath0 and co@xmath3 compared to ch@xmath0 and h@xmath3o is curious , but may be an artefact of the fact that the co@xmath3 column densities are better known for this sample than the h@xmath3o column densities . for most sources in this sample the h@xmath3o column densities",
    "are determined by estimating the depth of the h@xmath3o libration feature , which is difficult due to the overlap with the silicate feature at 9.7 @xmath2 m .",

    "[ h2omol ] ) . when normalizing to h@xmath3o there is no significant correlation at a 95% level between ch@xmath0 and ch@xmath7oh and co ( @xmath17 below 0.1 ) and at best a weak correlation between ch@xmath0 and co@xmath3 ( @xmath17 = 0.27 ) .",
    "there is also no correlation between ch@xmath0 abundances and any of the three co components as defined by @xcite , with the different components corresponding to pure co and co in a h@xmath3o and co@xmath3 rich ice respectively .      the average ch@xmath0 abundance relative to h@xmath3o and its standard deviation is shown for all clouds with more than one detection and for the entire sample in table [ cloudt ] .",
    "the averages for the individual clouds range from 2.8% to 9% , with serpens and ophiucuhs at 9 and 8% respectively . whether the clouds are significantly different in their ch@xmath0 abundances was evaluated using analysis of variance with the statistics101 resampling software .",
    "resampling is more robust than traditional statistical tests since there is no need to assume an underlying distribution , which is especially useful when the sample size is small .",
    "the test procedure starts with calculating the sum of the absolute deviations of the cloud averages from the sample average .",

    "these sources have been previously investigated for solid ch@xmath0 by @xcite and @xcite .",

    "the plot shows that the high mass iso ch@xmath0 sources fit in seamlessly with the low mass ch@xmath0 sources with h@xmath3o column densities above 2@xmath4 @xmath5 .",
    "figure [ isocomp ] also shows that there is a similar variation in the 7.7 @xmath2 m feature profile between low and high mass objects .",
    "there is hence no reason to expect large systematic differences in ch@xmath0 abundances or formation pathways toward low and high mass ysos .",
    "the similar or higher abundance of ch@xmath0 with respect to h@xmath3o toward the low mass sources in this sample compared to what has been found previously toward high mass young stellar objects , suggests that the ch@xmath0 formation rate is not dependent on stellar uv irradiation .",
    "of the three formation scenarios for ch@xmath0 suggested in the introduction , this study hence does not support a formation pathway connected to stellar uv processing of ch@xmath7oh .",
    "furthermore , in the sources with 240@xmath4 @xmath5 h@xmath3o the ch@xmath0 abundance is nearly constant . in comparison",
    "the ch@xmath7oh abundances vary by a factor of 10 and it seems unlikely that this would be the outcome if the main formation pathway of ch@xmath0 is connected to ch@xmath7oh through e.g. cosmic - ray induced uv processing of ch@xmath7oh , which is also present under quiescent conditions .    of the two remaining scenarios , formation in the gas phase with subsequent freeze - out and hydrogenation of c on grain surfaces , this study lends most support to the latter mechanism .",
    "first , under quiescent conditions , gas phase models predict steady state total ch@xmath0/h@xmath3 abundances of only around 10@xmath20 @xcite , compared with our inferred ch@xmath0/h@xmath3 abundances of @xmath21 ( assuming a standard h@xmath3o / h@xmath3 ratio of 10@xmath22 ) . in early times when c / co@xmath231 , the ch@xmath0/h@xmath3 can reach above 10@xmath24 @xcite .",
    "ices can not form at extinctions lower than @xmath25 a@xmath26 , however @xcite . at extinctions higher than 2 a@xmath26 , c / co@xmath271 and hence freeze - out of the high ch@xmath0 abundances at early times",
    "can not be used to explain the high ice abundances .",
    "in addition , pure ch@xmath0 has a similar volatility to co , within a few degrees @xcite , and if both are formed in the gas phase and subsequently frozen out , the two molecules should correlate , both in absolute column densities and in abundances relative to the much less volatile h@xmath3o .",
    "this study clearly shows that this is not the case .    this weak correlation between co and ch@xmath0",
    "can be contrasted with the stronger correlations between ch@xmath0 and co@xmath3 and h@xmath3o column densities .",
    "furthermore the lack of significant correlation with any species once the correlation with h@xmath3o has been effectively divided out , by normalizing with the h@xmath3o column densities , shows that ch@xmath0 is not significantly better related to any other molecule than to h@xmath3o .",
    "together this suggests a formation scenario of ch@xmath0 more related to h@xmath3o and co@xmath3 formation , which both form on grains , rather than to co. in theory the correlations could be single - handedly due to the fact that ch@xmath0 has a higher desorption temperature than in its pure form due to mixing with h@xmath3o .",
    "this , however , is only expected to occur if ch@xmath0 is formed together with h@xmath3o and hence ch@xmath0 formation on grain surfaces is still the most plausible outcome of this study .",
    "the hydrogenation scenario is also supported by the broad profiles of the features which have only been found in laboratory spectra when ch@xmath0 is in a mixture with hydrogen bonding molecules , which are believed to form on grain surfaces .",
    "these conclusions are in agreement with studies of the solid ch@xmath0 profiles toward high mass ysos , which show that solid ch@xmath0 is mixed with h@xmath3o or possibly ch@xmath7oh @xcite and also with the observed low gas / solid ratio of ch@xmath0 compared to co @xcite .      figure [ h2och4 ] and table [ cloudt ] shows that the ch@xmath0 abundances differ from cloud to cloud . in fig [ h2och4 ] , 4 of the 5 sources with high ch@xmath0 abundances and h@xmath3o column densities below 2@xmath4 @xmath5 are ophiuchus sources ( the fifth is in serpens ) .",
    "the two ophiuchus sources that have higher h@xmath3o ice abundances also have more normal ch@xmath0 abundances .",
    "this indicates that it is the low total column density towards four of the ophiuchus sources rather than initial conditions in ophiuchus as a whole that is responsible for the extreme ch@xmath0 abundances found there",
    ". this may be due to that towards sources with low total column densities the c / co ratio may be larger allowing for more ch@xmath0 to form .",
    "the c / co ratio is dependent on extinction for low extinctions , but not for high ones .",
    "this is consistent with our observation that ch@xmath0 abundances are only dependent on total column densities for low column densities .",
    "sakai et al .",
    "( apj in press ) have instead suggested that different ch@xmath0 abundances could be due to different collapse times . in clouds that collapse very fast",
    ", chemical equilibrium may not be reached favoring a c - based rather than co - based chemistry .",
    "this question can only be settled if gas phase data for these sources become available .",
    "solid ch@xmath0 abundances have been modelled previously for a variety of conditions @xcite .",
    "the predicted ch@xmath0 ice abundances with respect to h@xmath3o usually vary between @xmath28110% , with the main formation path being sequential hydrogenation of c atoms on grains at a time when a large fraction of the gas phase c has already been converted to co , i.e. c / co@xmath271 .",
    "the observed abundances in our sample fall mostly within this range and are hence in general agreement with the models .",
    "@xcite model molecular abundances on grain surfaces and in the gas phase during the collapse of a spherical cloud .",
    "regardless of initial conditions and the central density when the collapse is stopped , the ch@xmath0/h@xmath3o and ch@xmath0/co@xmath3 ice ratios are fairly constant as a function of radius in the cloud .",
    "the value of ch@xmath0/h@xmath3o ratio varies with initial conditions between a few and 10% .",
    "in contrast the ch@xmath0/co ratio is radius dependent .",
    "the model of @xcite is more aimed at modelling interstellar clouds before collapse , but as they show the time evolution of the chemistry it may still be useful to compare with our observations . as in the collapse model , ch@xmath0 , co@xmath3 and h@xmath3o trace each other fairly well , while co and ch@xmath0 are only correlated during some time intervals , regardless of initial conditions .",
