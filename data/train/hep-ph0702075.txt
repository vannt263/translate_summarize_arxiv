    "so far the standard approach to baryon spectroscopy is the constituent quark model where the hamiltonian contains a spin independent part formed of the kinetic plus the confinement energies and a spin dependent part given by a hyperfine interaction .",
    "the latter can be either due to one gluon exchange or to goldstone boson exchange between quarks , or it can be an instanton induced interaction . the results are naturally model dependent .",
    "it is therefore very important to develop model independent methods that can help in alternatively understanding baryon spectroscopy and that can support quark model assumptions .",
    "large @xmath1 qcd offers such a method . in 1974",
    "t hooft proposed to generalize qcd from su(3 ) to su(@xmath1 ) @xcite where @xmath1 is an arbitrary number of colors and suggested a perturbative expansion in the parameter @xmath0 , applicable to all qcd regimes .",
    "witten has generalized the approach to baryons @xcite and this has lead to a powerful @xmath0 expansion method to study static properties of baryons , as for example , the masses , the magnetic moments , the axial currents , etc .",
    "the method is systematic and predictive .",
    "it is based on the discovery that , in the limit @xmath2 , qcd possesses an exact contracted su(2@xmath3 ) symmetry @xcite where @xmath3 is the number of flavors .",
    "this symmetry is only approximate for finite @xmath1 so that corrections have to be added in powers of @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath0 expansion method has extensively and successfully been applied to ground state baryons @xcite ( for recent developments see ref .",
    "its applicability to excited states is a subject of current investigations . in this case",
    "the symmetry under consideration is assumed to be su(2@xmath3 ) @xmath4 o(3 ) where su(2@xmath3 ) is related qcd , as introduced above .",
    "however o(3 ) is not related to qcd but it brings an additional degree of freedom .",
    "it is of common practice to introduce it in order to construct orbitally excited states .",
    "the direct product su(2@xmath3 ) @xmath4 o(3 ) is also used in quark models to classify three quark states , but there su(2@xmath3 ) is not an intrinsic symmetry .",
    "thus the two approaches have formally the same symmetry in common which does not imply common dynamical assumptions .",
    "the only common feature is that the excited states are stable in a first approximation .",
    "the purpose of the present study is to see whether or not there is a compatibility between the two methods .",
    "if such a compatibility exists , an important support to the constituent quark model can be provided by the model independent @xmath0 expansion method , and a better understanding of the physical content of large @xmath1 mass formulas can be gained .    in the language of quark models",
    ", the baryon states can roughly be classified into excitation bands with @xmath5 for the ground state band and @xmath6 for excited states , where @xmath7 represents units of excitation , like in a harmonic oscillator picture .",
    "the key tool of this comparative study is that one can analyze both the @xmath0 expansion results and the quark model basic ingredients in terms of @xmath7 which makes the comparison between the two methods possible and very convenient .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the next section introduces the mass formula used in the @xmath0 expansion method .",
    "section iii gives a mass formula obtained from a hamiltonian quark model where the kinetic energy is relativistic , the confinement is an y - junction flux tubes and the hyperfine interaction is of an one - gluon exchange nature .",
    "section iv is devoted to the comparison between terms of the mass formula which are common in the two approaches .",
    "the last section is devoted to conclusions .",
    "the mass formula for the ground state up to order @xmath0 is simple because one can replace @xmath37 by @xmath36 , due to an identity which holds for symmetric @xmath42 $ ] states @xcite .",
    "as there is no orbital excitation , the mass formula  ( [ massoperator ] ) takes the following simple form @xmath43 which means that for @xmath5 only the operators @xmath44 and @xmath45 contribute to the mass .",
    "thus the fit gives quantitative information only for @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "for @xmath48 , @xmath49  mev for @xmath50 , and @xmath51  mev for @xmath52 , one gets @xmath53      among the excited states , those belonging to the @xmath54 band , or equivalently to the @xmath30 $ ] multiplet , have been most extensively studied , either for @xmath55 @xcite or for @xmath56 @xcite . in the latter case , first order corrections in su(3 ) symmetry breaking were also included .",
    "the @xmath57 band contains the @xmath58 $ ] , @xmath59 $ ] , @xmath60 $ ] ( @xmath61 = 0 , 2 ) and @xmath62 $ ] multiplets",
    ". there are no physical resonances associated to @xmath62 $ ] .",
    "the few studies related to the @xmath57 band concern the @xmath58 $ ] for @xmath3 = 2 @xcite , @xmath59 $ ] for @xmath56 @xcite , and @xmath60 $ ] for @xmath55 @xcite , later extended to @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "the method has also been applied @xcite to highly excited non - strange and strange baryons belonging to @xmath63 $ ] , the lowest multiplet of the @xmath64 band @xcite .",
    "the group theoretical similarity of excited symmetric states to the ground state makes the analysis of these states simple @xcite . for mixed symmetric states ,",
    "the situation is more complex .",
    "there is a standard procedure which reduces the study of mixed symmetric states to that of symmetric states .",
    "this is achieved by the decoupling of the baryon into an excited quark and a symmetric core of @xmath65 quarks .",
    "this procedure has been applied to the @xmath30 $ ] multiplet @xcite and to the @xmath60 $ ] ( @xmath61 = 0 , 2 ) multiplet @xcite .",
    "in fact the decoupling is not necessary , provided one knows the matrix elements of the su(2@xmath3 ) generators between mixed symmetric states .",
    "the case of su(4 ) has been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in section iv",
    ", we collect the values of @xmath46 , @xmath66 and @xmath47 obtained in the above studies in order to make a comparison between those values and their analogs resulting from the quark model described below .",
    "in the framework of potential models , it is generally assumed that a baryon , viewed as a bound state of three quarks , can be described in a first approximation by the following spinless salpeter hamiltonian @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the current mass of the quark @xmath25 , and @xmath69 the confining interaction potential .",
    "the nonperturbative part of the gluon exchanges , responsible for the confinement , can be successfully described in the flux tube model @xcite . in this framework , each quark is assumed to generate a string , or a flux tube , characterized by its energy density ( string tension ) .",
    "recent developments in lattice qcd tend to confirm the y - junction as the correct configuration for the flux tubes in baryons @xcite . in this picture ,",
    "a flux tube starts from each quark and the tubes meet at the toricelli point of the triangle formed by the three quarks .",
    "this point , denoted by @xmath70 , is such that it minimizes the sum of the flux tube lengths , and its position is a complicated function of the quark coordinates @xmath71 .",
    "moreover , the energy density of the tubes appears to be equal for mesons and baryons .",
    "the y - junction potential reads @xmath72 in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been shown that this complicated potential is successfully approximated by the more easily computable expression @xmath73,\\ ] ] where @xmath74 is the position of the center of mass . if @xmath75 , eq .",
    "( [ pot1 ] ) is a simplified y - junction , where the toricelli point is replaced by the center of mass .",
    "if @xmath76 , this interaction reduces to a @xmath77-type potential .",
    "results of ref .",
    "@xcite , obtained in the framework of a potential model , show that @xmath75 gives a better description than @xmath76 , and that the y - junction is approximated at best by @xmath78 close to @xmath79 .",
    "let us now introduce auxiliary fields , in order to get rid of the square roots appearing in the hamiltonian ( [ ssh ] ) .",
    "we get @xmath80\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\alpha\\sum^3_{j=1}\\left[\\frac { a^2 ( \\vec{x}_j-\\vec{r})^2}{2\\nu_j}+ \\frac{\\nu_j}{2}\\right]+\\frac{(1-\\alpha)}{2}\\sum_{j < k}\\left[\\frac{a^2 ( \\vec{x}_j-\\vec{x}_k)^2}{2\\lambda_{jk}}+\\frac{\\lambda_{jk}}{2}\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the auxiliary fields , denoted as @xmath81 , and @xmath82 are , strictly speaking , operators . although being formally simpler , @xmath83 is equivalent to @xmath84 up to the elimination of the auxiliary fields thanks to the constraints    [ elim ] @xmath85    it is worth mentioning that @xmath86 can be seen as a dynamical mass of a quark of current mass @xmath68 , while @xmath87 is , in this case , the static energy of the straight string linking the quark @xmath25 to the toricelli point  @xcite .",
    "similarly , @xmath88 can be interpreted as the static energy of a straight string joining the quarks @xmath25 and @xmath89 .",
    "although the auxiliary fields are operators , the calculations are considerably simplified if one considers them as real numbers .",
    "they are then finally eliminated by a minimization of the masses with respect to them @xcite .",
    "the extremal values of @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath82 , considered as numbers , are logically close to the values of @xmath86 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 given by relations  ( [ elim ] ) .",
    "this procedure leads to a spectrum which is an upper bound of the  true spectrum \" ( computed without auxiliary fields ) @xcite : it can be shown that , the more auxiliary fields are introduced , the higher are the masses compared to those without auxiliary fields @xcite .",
    "let us finally mention that , for @xmath75 , the hamiltonian  ( [ ham3b ] ) can be related to the rotating string model for a baryon ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been shown that the eigenvalues of a hamiltonian of the form ( [ ham3b ] ) can be analytically found by making an appropriate change of variables , the quark coordinates @xmath94 being replaced by new coordinates @xmath95 .",
    "the center of mass is defined as @xmath96 with @xmath97 and @xmath98 being the two relative coordinates . from ref .",
    "@xcite , it can be immediately found that the mass spectrum of bound states of three massless particles ( @xmath99 for the @xmath100 and @xmath101 quarks ) is given by @xmath102 with @xmath103},\\ ] ] @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "an obvious symmetry argument helps us to make the identification @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 . in this symmetric case ,",
    "properties of the equilateral triangle together with the relations  ( [ elim ] ) allow to make the following ansatz @xmath109 defining @xmath110 and @xmath111 we find @xmath112 formula ( [ mass3_s ] ) is clearly symmetric in @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "that means that we can set @xmath115 .",
    "this equality can be viewed as a sort of virial theorem .",
    "then we have @xmath116 one can easily find that the relation @xmath117 implies @xmath118^{1/2},\\ ] ] and @xmath119 , as observed in ref .",
    "writing explicitly the square mass , we see that the model of ref .",
    "@xcite also predicts regge trajectories , which are in agreement with the experimental data for light baryons @xmath120 the regge slope is here given by @xmath121 .",
    "however , from experiment we know that the regge slope for light baryons and light mesons are approximately equal . for light mesons ,",
    "the exact value in the relativistic flux tube model is @xmath122 , a lower value than the one obtained from formula  ( [ mass3q ] ) .",
    "this is due to the auxiliary fields method : the more auxiliary fields we introduce , the more the masses are overestimated @xcite .",
    "what can be done to cure this problem is to rescale @xmath123 : let us define @xmath124 such that @xmath125 .",
    "then , formula  ( [ mass3q ] ) is able to reproduce the light baryon regge slope for a physical value @xmath126 gev@xmath127 .",
    "note that the best value for @xmath78 is @xmath79 .",
    "consequently , the best value for @xmath128 is @xmath129 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that such a rescaling of the string tension has already given good results in the study of hybrid mesons @xcite .      although including only the confining energy is sufficient to understand the regge trajectories of light baryons , it is well - known that the absolute value of the masses which are obtained are too high with respect to the experimental data .",
    "other contributions are needed to decrease these masses and we shall estimate their effect perturbatively .",
    "the most widely used is a coulomb interaction term of the form @xmath130 arising from one gluon exchange processes , where @xmath131 is the strong coupling constant , usually assumed to be around @xmath132 for light hadrons @xcite .",
    "lattice qcd calculations also support this value @xcite . assuming that @xmath133 , and using symmetry arguments , relations  ( [ elim ] ) lead to @xmath134 @xmath135    another interesting contribution to the mass , which can be added perturbatively , is the quark - self energy .",
    "recently , it was shown that the quark self - energy , which is created by the color magnetic moment of a quark propagating through the vacuum background field , adds a negative constant to the hadron masses @xcite .",
    "its negative sign is due to the paramagnetic nature of the particular mechanism at work in this case .",
    "the quark self - energy contribution for three massless quarks is given by @xcite @xmath136 the factor @xmath137 has been computed in lattice qcd studies .",
    "first quenched calculations gave @xmath138 @xcite .",
    "a more recent unquenched work @xcite gives @xmath139 . since",
    "its value is still a matter of research , we will only assume that @xmath140 $ ] .    with the unperturbed baryon mass @xmath141 , given by eq .",
    "( [ mass3q ] ) , the total mass is given by the sum @xmath142 .",
    "then , in the first order of perturbation and for @xmath143 , it is straightforward to obtain the following mass formula for baryons @xmath144 where the scaling @xmath125 has been used .",
    "the effects of the one gluon exchange term and of the quark self - energy are thus to shift the square mass spectrum by a global negative amount .",
    "let us note that the symbol @xmath7 defined by eq .",
    "( [ n ] ) and the quantity @xmath7 used to classify baryon states and used to plot results from the @xmath0 expansion are the same .",
    "this common @xmath7 will be used in the next section to perform a comparison between the results obtained in both approaches .",
    "the mass formula  ( [ massf ] ) does not take into account spin relativistic contributions , as the spin - spin or spin - orbit forces . within the auxiliary field formalism , all these corrections to the static potential",
    "are expanded in powers of @xmath145 where @xmath113 is the constituent quark mass @xcite .",
    "all the spin corrections to the mass formula  ( [ massf ] ) must depend both on the matrix elements of the interaction and on the coefficient @xmath145 .",
    "in the following , we shall consider that the dominant dynamical effect is due to the constituent mass , while the matrix elements remain roughly constant with @xmath7 , as presented in the next section .",
    "in the @xmath0 expansion method , the first term @xmath146 in the mass formula of eq .",
    "( [ massoperator ] ) contains the main spin - independent contribution to the baryon mass , which in a quark model language , represents the confinement and the kinetic energy .",
    "so , it is natural to identify this term with the mass given by the formula  ( [ massf ] ) .",
