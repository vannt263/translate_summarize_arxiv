    "in this letter we present a computation of the bare @xmath5-function in the lattice formulation of the @xmath4 gauge theory , with @xmath9 flavors of overlap fermions in an arbitrary representation of the gauge group @xmath4 .",
    "this work is a sequel to a longer publication  @xcite , in which the computation was performed with fermions in the fundamental representation .",
    "we will refer to  @xcite for the general background and notation .    while the main application of @xmath4 gauge theories on the lattice regards qcd , where fermions are in the fundamental representation of @xmath12 , there has recently been some interest in gauge theories with fermions in other representations and with @xmath13 .",
    "such theories are being studied in various contexts  @xcite , e.g. , supersymmetry , phase transitions , and the ads / qcd correspondence .    in later years",
    ", use of non - ultralocal actions which preserve chiral symmetry on the lattice has become more viable for numerical simulations .",
    "the two actions which are being used most frequently are overlap fermions  @xcite based on the wilson fermion action and domain - wall fermions  @xcite .",
    "overlap fermions are notoriously difficult to study , both numerically and analytically .",
    "many recent promising investigations involving simulations with overlap fermions have appeared ; see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite . regarding analytical computations ,",
    "the only ones performed thus far have been either up to 1 loop , such as refs .",
    "@xcite , or vacuum diagrams at higher loops  @xcite . _ the present work ( along with ref .",
    "@xcite ) is the first one involving non - vacuum diagrams beyond the 1-loop level . _",
    "we compute the 2-loop renormalization @xmath7 of the bare lattice coupling constant @xmath0 in the presence of overlap fermions .",
    "we relate @xmath0 to the renormalized coupling constant @xmath14 as defined in the @xmath15 scheme at a scale @xmath16 ; at large momenta , these quantities are related as follows @xmath17 ( @xmath18 lattice spacing ) .",
    "the 1-loop coefficient @xmath19 has been known for a long time ; several evaluations of @xmath20 have also appeared in the past @xmath2110 years , either in the absence of fermions @xcite , or using the wilson @xcite or clover @xcite fermionic actions .",
    "knowledge of @xmath20 , together with the 3-loop @xmath1-renormalized @xmath5-function @xcite , allows us to derive the 3-loop bare lattice @xmath5-function , which dictates the dependence of the lattice spacing on @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , it provides a correction to the standard 2-loop asymptotic scaling formula which defines the renormalization group invariant scale @xmath22 .",
    "ongoing efforts to estimate the running coupling from the lattice @xcite have relied on a mixture of perturbative and non - perturbative investigations . as a particular example , relating @xmath23 to @xmath24 ( sf : schrdinger functional scheme ) , entails an intermediate passage through the bare coupling @xmath25 ; the conversion from @xmath23 to @xmath25 is then carried out perturbatively .",
    "the present study , being the first of its kind in calculating 2-loop diagrams with overlap vertices and external momentum dependence , had a number of obstacles to overcome .",
    "one first complication is the size of the algebraic form of the feynman vertices ; as an example , the vertex with 4 gluons and a fermion - antifermion pair contains @xmath21724,000 terms when expanded . upon contraction",
    "these vertices lead to huge expressions ( many millions of terms ) ; this places severe requirements both on the necessary computer ram and on the efficiency of the computer algorithms which we must design to manipulate such expressions automatically .",
    "numerical integration of feynman diagrams over loop momentum variables is performed on a range of lattices , with finite size @xmath26 , and subsequent extrapolation to @xmath27 . as it turns out ,",
    "larger @xmath26 are required for an accurate extrapolation in the present case , as compared to ultra - local actions .",
    "in addition , since the results depend nontrivially on the parameter @xmath8 of the overlap action , numerical evaluation must be performed for a sufficiently wide set of values of @xmath8 , with an almost proportionate increase in cpu time .",
    "extreme choices of values for @xmath8 ( @xmath28 ) show unstable numerical behaviour , which is attributable to the spurious poles of the fermion propagator for these choices ; this forces us to even larger @xmath26 .",
    "a consequence of all complications noted above is an extended use of cpu time : our numerical integration codes , which ran on a 32-node cluster of dual cpu pentium iv processors , required a total of @xmath2150 years of cpu time .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the necessary theoretical background for the @xmath5-function , @xmath7 and @xmath11 is given in section ii .",
    "section iii describes briefly the overlap action and section iv provides details on our computation and results for the fundamental representation .",
    "a generalization of the above results to an arbitrary representation is carried out in section v. we employ the formulae of section v to find numerical results for the 3-loop @xmath5-function and the ratio @xmath11 .",
    "results for the adjoint representation appear in section vi .",
    "for the lattice regularization a bare @xmath5-function is defined as @xmath29 where @xmath16 is the renormalization scale and @xmath30 @xmath31 the renormalized ( bare ) coupling constant .",
    "it is well known that in the asymptotic limit for qcd ( @xmath32 ) , one can write the expansion of the @xmath5-function in powers of @xmath0 , that is @xmath33 the coefficients @xmath34 are universal , regularization independent constants ( see eqs .",
    "( [ univ_coeff_b0 ] ) , ( [ univ_coeff_b1 ] ) ) . on the contrary",
    ", @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) depends on the regulator ; it must be determined perturbatively . in the present work",
    "we calculate the coefficient @xmath37 using the @xmath38 fermionic action and wilson gluons .",
    "@xmath39 can be computed from the renormalization function @xmath7 , which is defined through @xmath40 , and relates the bare lattice coupling to the one renormalized in the @xmath41 scheme .",
    "up to 2-loops , @xmath7 can be written in the form @xmath42 the quantities @xmath34 and @xmath43 have been known in the literature for quite some time  @xcite ; @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the same as those of the renormalized @xmath5-function .",
    "the constant @xmath43 is related to the ratio of the @xmath46 parameters associated with the particular lattice regularization and the @xmath41 renormalization scheme @xmath47 for overlap fermions in the fundamental representation the exact form of @xmath43 has been given in ref .",
    "the value of @xmath43 for different representations is presented in section v.    one can extract @xmath6 from @xmath7 through @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the 3-loop coefficient of the renormalized @xmath5-function in the @xmath41 scheme  @xcite .",
    "thus , the evaluation of @xmath37 requires only the determination of the 2-loop quantity @xmath50 .",
    "the most convenient and economical way to proceed with calculating @xmath51 is to use the background field technique @xcite , in which the following relation is valid @xmath52 where @xmath53 , defined as : @xmath54 is the background field renormalization function ( @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) : bare ( renormalized ) background field ) . in this framework , instead of @xmath51 , it suffices to compute @xmath57 , with no need to evaluate any 3-point functions . for this purpose",
