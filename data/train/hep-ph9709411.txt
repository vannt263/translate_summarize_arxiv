    "for over half a century , one of the major puzzles in particle physics has been the question of why quark and lepton families replicate .",
    "although we have accumulated a wealth of data concerning the masses and mixings of quarks and leptons , we still appear to be far from a true understanding of family structure . in the absence of a concrete model to consider ,",
    "it is natural to postulate the existence of some family symmetry  @xcite that plays a role in determining the observed particle spectrum .",
    "once we consider such a family symmetry , we face a plethora of options . the symmetry may be ( 1 ) discrete , ( 2 ) continuous and local , or ( 3 ) continuous and global . within each of these categories",
    ", one may choose any of a number of symmetry groups , and the overall family symmetry may even be a combination of the three possibilities .    of course , any exact family symmetry of the underlying theory must be spontaneously broken at some energy scale since we know that the quark and lepton masses are very different from one family to the next . for option ( 1 ) , spontaneously broken discrete symmetries , domain walls are the only model - independent predictions , and these can not be studied in particle physics laboratories . in case ( 2 ) , the masses of the family gauge bosons of spontaneously broken local continuous symmetries can be constrained , _",
    "e.g. _ , from @xmath10-@xmath11 mixing  @xcite .    from a phenomenological point of view",
    ", however , possibility ( 3 ) is particularly enticing , as it implies the existence of massless nambu ",
    "goldstone bosons , called `` familons , '' from the spontaneously broken family symmetry",
    ". this family symmetry may be either abelian or non - abelian ; nambu ",
    "goldstone bosons associated with the spontaneous symmetry breaking of an abelian lepton number symmetry are often called `` majorons.''-parity breaking  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we study a number of probes , many of which are applicable to both abelian and non - abelian symmetries .",
    "we use the generic name `` familon '' to denote the associated nambu  goldstone bosons in either case . ]",
    "the existence of new massless particles has many implications in particle physics , astrophysics , and cosmology , and , as we will see , may be probed in a wide variety of experiments .",
    "moreover , the couplings of familons at low energies are determined by the non - linear realization of the family symmetry .",
    "these couplings are , _",
    "e.g. _ , of the form    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the family symmetry breaking scale , _",
    "i.e. _ , the familon decay constant , @xmath14 are the familons , @xmath15 are the generators of the broken symmetry , and the @xmath16 are fermion fields in terms of which the flavor symmetry is defined .",
    "the strength of the familon coupling is therefore inversely proportional to @xmath13 and can be constrained for a given family symmetry group in a model - independent manner .",
    "familon couplings between the first and second generations have been studied extensively and will be reviewed below .",
    "in contrast , however , couplings involving the third generation are largely unexplored , although they may have rather rich phenomenological and cosmological implications  @xcite .",
    "current constraints in the lepton sector are relatively weak , with the best bounds coming from @xmath17 bounds  @xcite , and there are at present no corresponding bounds reported in the hadronic sector ( see , however , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . at the same time , it is a logical possibility that the familon couples preferentially to the third generation , and models have been proposed in which this is the case  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore interesting to explore the possibilities for improving ( or setting ) bounds on familon scales for the third generation , especially in light of the upcoming @xmath8 physics experiments .    in this paper",
    ", we will study what we believe to be the most sensitive probes of couplings of familons to the third generation , primarily to @xmath18 leptons and @xmath19 quarks .",
    "we show that dedicated analyses of existent data from cleo , argus , and lep could probe family symmetry breaking scales up to @xmath20  gev and may be significantly improved at future @xmath8 factories .",
    "simply because this is largely unexplored physics , there is a high discovery potential for familons at these facilities .",
    "familon couplings to the third generation are also of interest from a cosmological point of view .",
    "the mass of the @xmath18 neutrino is still allowed to be as large as 18.2  mev experimentally  @xcite .",
    "a heavy @xmath18 neutrino has interesting consequences for both big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn )   and large scale structure formation  @xcite , as will be discussed in sec .",

    "( the three neutrino mode is strongly disfavored and therefore the familon mode is most preferred . )",
    "there is therefore an interesting interplay between experimental searches for familons and scenarios requiring heavy neutrinos , and , as we will see , future collider experiments and analyses may severely constrain a number of such cosmologically motivated scenarios .",

    "the standard model contains 15 particle states in each of the 3 generations .",

    ".    the massless nambu - goldstone bosons of the spontaneously broken flavor symmetry , familons  @xcite , have interactions given by the couplings    @xmath33    where @xmath14 are the familon fields , and @xmath34 are flavor currents .",
    "the interactions are suppressed by @xmath13 , the scale at which the flavor symmetry is spontaneously broken .",

    "the second line of eq .",
    "( [ famint ] ) is of course only valid for on - shell fermions such as external leptons , whereas in hadronic matrix elements and processes including off - shell fermions , the derivative coupling of the first line must be used .",
    "we see that familons may mediate or be produced in family - changing processes .",
    "they may also couple to identical fermions @xmath47 , but only through axial couplings .",
    "what processes are mediated by familons depends on the particular family symmetry group that is broken . for example , for o(@xmath48 ) groups , the generators @xmath49 are anti - symmetric , and so do not generate flavor - diagonal interactions .",
    "however , they do generate interactions like @xmath50 , where we have considered axial vector current interactions as an example .",

    "[ sec : mesons ] .",
    "the situation is reversed for su(@xmath48 ) groups . here ,",
    "flavor - diagonal couplings exist .",

    "mass mixings may therefore generate flavor - diagonal interactions from flavor off - diagonal interactions , and vice versa .",
    "for example , in the case of an abelian u(1 ) symmetry , mass mixing effects may generate flavor - changing interactions .",
    "they may also extend non - maximal family symmetries to couplings involving all three generations ; for example , a u(2 ) symmetry between the first and second families , may , after rotation to mass eigenstates , result in familon interactions involving the third generation .    while the phenomenology of familons varies from group to group , it is important to note that gauge symmetry relates the familon interactions of particles in the same gauge multiplet . as an example , let us consider a spontaneously broken lepton flavor symmetry .",
    "the familon interaction is then given by    @xmath61    where the su(2 ) lepton doublets @xmath62 are in the flavor eigenstate basis .",
    "this interaction therefore generates familon interactions for both the charged leptons and neutrinos . in the presence of neutrino masses",
    ", the flavor eigenstates may not correspond to mass eigenstates .",
    "the familon interactions in the mass basis are then    @xmath63    where @xmath64 , and we have defined @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "@xmath67 and @xmath68 are therefore related by a similarity transformation , and in the presence of mass mixing , the couplings of the interactions of @xmath69 and @xmath70 are not necessarily identical . however , in the absence of fine - tuning , we expect these couplings to be of the same magnitude .",
    "bounds on one familon interaction may thus be considered to imply comparable bounds on the other interactions linked by gauge symmetry .",
    "because the familon interactions of particles in the same gauge multiplet are comparable in the absence of fine - tuning , there are many more relations in theories with enlarged gauge groups . for example , for su(5 ) grand unified theories ( guts ) , the particles @xmath71 are expected to have comparable familon interactions , as are the particles @xmath72 .",
    "a particularly relevant example for our study below is that , in the gut framework , bounds on familon decays of @xmath8 mesons imply bounds on familon decays of tau neutrinos in the absence of fine - tuning .",

    "finally , we note that the bounds on @xmath347 branching ratios are expected to be even better at a tau - charm factory .",
    "@xcite has shown that one can reach the level of @xmath348 using the standard optics or even @xmath349 using a monochromator .",
    "this would raise the lower bound on the flavor scale to @xmath350  gev .",
    "the @xmath351 mode is more difficult , and is limited by the @xmath352 separation capability  @xcite .",
    "however , a bound better than the @xmath319 level using a rich detector for particle identification is expected  @xcite .",
    "non - standard properties of neutrinos are always interesting in cosmology , and in fact , heavy unstable neutrinos are advocated in certain scenarios to obtain reasonable agreement between theory and observation . the heavy neutrino is typically taken to be the tau neutrino , and we will assume this to be the case in this section . once a decaying neutrino is required , its decay into a lighter neutrino and a massless boson is the most harmless .",
    "visible neutrino decays are usually severely constrained from sn 1987a . as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : astrophysics ] , the energy released from sn 1987a was mostly carried away in neutrinos , and the visible luminosity of sn 1987a was much smaller . however , if neutrinos decay into visible particles , such as photons or electrons , neutrinos emitted from sn 1987a that decay before reaching the earth may increase the apparent visible luminosity of sn 1987a to levels much larger than observed  @xcite .   in addition , scenarios with @xmath18 neutrinos decaying into three neutrinos are also dangerous , since , in the absence of fine - tuning , such models also predict large flavor violating @xmath18 decays ( like @xmath353 ) by su(2)@xmath354 gauge symmetry  . in particular , in the cosmological models to be described below , the resulting flavor - violating @xmath18 decay rates are already excluded by current bounds .",
    "this is because , for these three - body decays , the flavor - violating @xmath18 branching fraction is of order @xmath355 ( to be compared with @xmath356 for the two - body familon decays ) , and hence is extremely enhanced for scenarios with neutrino masses in the currently allowed range .",
    "therefore , if we adopt a massive unstable neutrino as a solution to cosmological problems , massless bosons are good candidates for its decay products .",
    "the familon is an example of such a massless boson .",
    "( in the literature , a particular example of a familon , the majoron , is often considered . ) if neutrinos decay to familons , cosmological scenarios , which require specific ranges for neutrino masses and lifetimes , then predict rates for familon signals in future experiments , or may even be excluded from current familon bounds , assuming an absence of fine - tuning . in this section ,",
    "we first review some of the potentially interesting cosmological scenarios that require massive neutrinos .",
    "then , assuming that the massive tau neutrino decays through @xmath357 , where @xmath358 , we will discuss how well these scenarios may be constrained by current and future collider searches for familons .    among the several cosmological motivations for massive neutrinos",
    "is the `` crisis '' in the standard bbn scenario .",
    "the standard bbn scenario contains only one free parameter , the baryon to photon ratio @xmath359 ; the abundances of the light elements are predicted once we fix @xmath359 . until a few years ago , the theoretical prediction with @xmath360 was in good agreement with observations .",
    "recently , however , it has been claimed that the predictions of the standard bbn are disfavored by observations of the light element abundances  @xcite : normalizing @xmath359 with the d and @xmath361he abundances , the observed @xmath362he abundance is claimed to be smaller than the standard bbn prediction .",
    "there are several arguments against this viewpoint on the observational side .",
    "for example , the apparent discrepancy vanishes if one adopts a larger systematic error in the observed @xmath362he abundance  @xcite , or if the recently measured d abundance in high red - shift qso absorber systems is regarded as a primordial one  @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "if we regard this `` crisis '' as a genuine problem with the standard bbn theory , it can be taken as an indication of new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "there are several attempts to solve this crisis by a modification of the standard scenario  @xcite . here",
    ", we concentrate on a solution that uses massive unstable neutrinos to reduce the predicted @xmath362he abundance .",
    "since the @xmath362he abundance decreases as the energy density at the neutron freeze out time decreases , the @xmath362he abundance becomes smaller if @xmath363 , the `` effective number of neutrino species '' at the neutron freeze out time , is reduced . in the standard bbn ,",
    "@xmath363 is 3 , but it can be smaller if heavy neutrinos decay and effectively convert their energy density into lighter particles .",
    "for example , in the presence of the decay mode @xmath357 , if all the tau neutrinos are converted into thermal familons and light neutrinos , @xmath364 .",
    "bbn scenarios with massive neutrinos decaying to familons have been discussed in refs .  .",
    "the most recent calculation shows that a massive neutrino with @xmath365 mev and @xmath366 sec can resolve the conflict between theory and observation  @xcite .",
    "decaying massive neutrinos are also interesting for large scale structure formation .",
    "the standard cold dark matter ( cdm ) scenario , which assumes a flat universe , a scale - invariant initial spectrum , and that the universe is mostly filled with slowly moving ( `` cold '' ) particles  @xcite , is very attractive in explaining the origin of large scale structure .",
    "however , if the normalization of the power spectrum is fixed by the anisotropy in the temperature of the cosmic background radiation observed by cobe , the standard cdm scenario predicts too large density fluctuations at small scales ( @xmath367 mpc ) .",
    "attempts to explain the scale dependence of the density perturbations include proposals of cdm with a small component of hot dark matter or with a cosmological constant  @xcite , or scenarios with a tilted initial density fluctuation  @xcite .    as pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite , cdm with late decaying neutrinos also provides a solution to this problem .",
    "if the neutrino lifetime is long enough , neutrinos dominate the energy density of the universe at the temperature @xmath368 . after this stage ,",
    "the mass density of the neutrino , @xmath369 , scales as @xmath370 .",
    "neutrinos then decay at time @xmath371 .",
    "once they decay , the energy density of the neutrinos is converted to radiation energy density , resulting in an increase of the radiation energy density without affecting the background photons .",
    "this then delays the time of matter - radiation equality , the matter - dominated era starts later , and , with the cobe normalization , the density perturbations at small scales are reduced . due to the neutrino decay , the energy density of the radiation is increased by the factor @xmath372 , where @xmath373 is the temperature just before the neutrino decay . as we can see",
    ", physics ( approximately ) depends on the combination @xmath374 . to obtain the correct density fluctuation at small scales , this combination must lie in the range @xmath375  @xcite .    in these scenarios ,",
    "the neutrino mass must also lie in a specific interval .",
    "the neutrino must be heavier than about 50  ev ; otherwise , its mass density is always smaller than ( or at most comparable to ) the mass density of the cdm , and the scenario does not work well . on the other hand ,",
    "if the neutrino mass is above @xmath376 1 mev , the neutrinos decouple from the thermal bath after becoming non - relativistic , and their number density is reduced . in this case , the constraint given above is not applicable . furthermore",
    ", if the neutrino mass is in the range @xmath376 1  10 mev while the lifetime is longer than @xmath376 1 sec , the neutrino mass density may be so large at the neutron freeze out time that @xmath362he can be overproduced .",
    "such lifetimes and large neutrino masses are therefore also disfavored from bbn considerations  @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we consider the mass range @xmath377 , with the above caveats in mind .",
    "to summarize , we consider the following two cosmological scenarios :    * bbn : @xmath365 mev , and @xmath366 sec .",
    "* structure formation : @xmath378 , with @xmath379 .",
    "these scenarios require decays to familons @xmath380 .",
    "as we discussed previously , this process is related to the decay modes @xmath5 and @xmath93 though su(2)@xmath354 and gut gauge symmetries , respectively .",
    "thus , searches for these decay modes are interesting tests of these scenarios .",
    "let us start with the @xmath18 familon decay mode .",
    "if the decay mode @xmath380 exists , by su(2)@xmath354 symmetry , the charged @xmath18 lepton must also have flavor - changing couplings to familons :    @xmath381    if there is no fine - tuning , @xmath382 .",
    "notice that , if the right - handed leptons also transform under the flavor group , they also couple to familons , and such interactions may increase the rare @xmath18 decay rate .",
    "the following argument is therefore conservative . from the above lagrangian",
    ", we obtain the decay rate    @xmath383    and , using eq .",
    "( [ tau_nu ] ) , we find @xmath384 in fig .",
    "[ fig : mvst_tau ] contours of constant @xmath385 are shown in the @xmath386 plane , assuming @xmath387 .",
    "= 0.6    from eq .",
    "( [ gamma_tau ] ) , we see that , in the absence of fine - tuning , the bbn scenario with decaying neutrinos predicts @xmath388 to @xmath389 .",
    "the current bounds @xmath390 and @xmath110  @xcite therefore do not constrain this scenario . however , if the sensitivity of future experiments is improved by one order of magnitude or more , the predictions of this scenario may be tested , and , if the scenario is correct , exotic @xmath18 decays may be seen .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : mvst_tau ] . )",
    "the scenarios motivated by structure formation are also interesting . in this case , eq .  ( [ gamma_tau ] ) implies @xmath391 to @xmath392 . comparing this result with the current bound , part of the parameter region of this scenario",
    "is already excluded . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : taubounds ] , future experiments may reach a sensitivity for @xmath344 of @xmath319 or possibly @xmath318 .",
    "thus , if the cdm scenario were realized , the familon decay mode is likely to be found if the neutrino is lighter than @xmath393 kev .",
    "the region disfavored by bbn  @xcite is also shown by a light shading .",
    "up to now , we have only used su(2)@xmath354 gauge symmetry to relate the neutrino - familon interaction to existing and future constraints on @xmath18 decays . however ,",
    "if we assume that the same familon also couples to down - type quarks , the above cosmological scenarios may also be probed by rare @xmath19 decays .",
    "such is the case in su(5 ) guts , where the lepton doublet and right - handed down - type quarks are in the same multiplet , and so we also have a coupling of the form @xmath394 and similarly for @xmath216 . with this lagrangian , we obtain @xmath395 where we have used @xmath396 gev , and @xmath397 sec . comparing eq .",
    "( [ gamma_b ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ gamma_tau ] ) , we can see that the branching ratio @xmath152 is enhanced by about two orders of magnitude relative to @xmath385 .",
    "this results from an enhancement by a factor @xmath398 , and also the fact that the total decay rate of the @xmath19 quark is @xmath177 suppressed , and so is even smaller than that of the @xmath18 lepton , despite its larger mass .",
    "contours of constant @xmath399 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mvst_bot ] . for the cosmologically - motivated scenarios , the ranges of @xmath399 are @xmath400 to @xmath320 ( bbn ) , and 1 to @xmath349 ( structure formation ) . because the @xmath19 decay rates are so enhanced , in each case , the high value in the predicted range is above bounds which can be expected from the current data .",
    "future experiments may reach a sensitivity of @xmath401 ( corresponding to @xmath402 in sec .",
    "[ sec : bbounds ] ) and will thus cover most of the preferred parameter regions .",
    "= 0.6    finally we comment on @xmath185 measurements at future @xmath8 factories .",
    "as we mentioned earlier , the upper bound on @xmath185 will be significantly improved at future @xmath8 factories , to the level of 1  3 mev .",
    "the parameter region that will be covered has a significant overlap with the neutrino mass required in the above mentioned cosmological scenarios , and hence such mass measurements provide another probe of these scenarios .",
    "the bbn scenario with massive unstable neutrinos will be fully tested by the tau neutrino mass measurement in future @xmath8 factories . on the other hand , for the structure formation scenario ,",
    "most of the interesting parameter region ( @xmath403 mev ) may be covered by the search for @xmath404 , and even if the neutrino mass is above @xmath376 1 mev , this scenario can be checked by the direct measurement of the tau neutrino mass ( though this region is disfavored by bbn ) .",
    "therefore , in this case , measurements of the mass and the branching ratios will have complementary roles .",
    "if global family symmetries play a role in determining the patterns of masses and mixings of the quarks and leptons , they must be spontaneously broken .",
    "familons ( or majorons ) , the massless goldstone bosons associated with these broken symmetries , allow rare opportunities to probe the physics at very high mass scales in a multitude of low energy settings , and their discovery will signal a breakthrough in attempts to understand the flavor structure of the standard model .",
    "the experimental investigation of familons has in the past focussed on familons coupled to the first two generations .",
    "as we reviewed , such investigations have led to stringent lower bounds on the flavor breaking scale @xmath13 of @xmath405 gev and @xmath406 gev in the leptonic and hadronic sectors , respectively .",
    "in contrast , bounds for familons coupling to the third generation are much less thoroughly studied . in the lepton sector ,",
    "constraints from rare @xmath18 decays lead to constraints @xmath407 gev ; in the hadronic sector , no bounds have been previously reported .",
    "the lack of study of third generation familons is conspicuous , especially in light of their cosmological relevance and the upcoming @xmath8 factory experiments , which hold promise for studying @xmath19 and @xmath18 decays with great precision .    motivated by these considerations , we have presented a large and eclectic group of bounds which we believe place the most stringent constraints on third generation familon couplings . as emphasized in sec .",
    "[ sec : collider ] , the experimental and astrophysical implications of familons vary strongly with the underlying flavor symmetry and depend on whether the flavor symmetry is real or complex , the familon couplings are axial or vector - like , and whether they are flavor - diagonal or non - diagonal .",
    "for instance , bounds on @xmath83 decay in the presence of mixing effects may in general impose bounds of order @xmath408 gev on third - generation flavor breaking scales , but there are classes of models in which such bounds do not apply .",
    "it is therefore important to consider a wide variety of experimental signatures .",
    "different signatures are also related through some well - motivated theoretical considerations : in the absence of fine - tuning , the familon couplings of particles related by gauge symmetry are expected to be similar in strength .",
    "probes of @xmath18 decays to familons are therefore indirect probes of @xmath182 familon couplings , and in su(5 ) grand unified theories , these are both related to @xmath19 decays .",
    "we began by considering bounds from currently available accelerator data .",
    "present values for neutral meson mass splittings imply bounds on the flavor scale of @xmath409 to @xmath410 gev for real familons .",
    "bounds from neutral meson decays to leptons are significantly weaker , at the level of @xmath411 gev , and require both hadronic and leptonic couplings .",
    "more promising are bounds from exotic @xmath19 decays at lep . by extrapolating from current bounds on @xmath92 , we estimate that an analysis of currently available lep data may provide a sensitivity to @xmath399 at the level of @xmath412 , leading to probes of flavor scales of the order of @xmath413 gev .",
    "familons also have astrophysical implications , as they may lead to anomalously fast cooling of supernovae , red giants , and white dwarfs .",
    "bounds from direct couplings to @xmath210 are generally weak .",
    "however , couplings of familons to particles of the third generation may also induce couplings to electrons and nucleons radiatively or through flavor mixing effects .",
    "bounds on such couplings are model - dependent , but may be stringent ; in the simple case where a familon couples diagonally to @xmath134 quarks , a bound of @xmath414 gev from radiatively induced couplings may be set .    finally , having evaluated a host of new bounds , we considered the prospects for analyses at future @xmath8 factories .",
    "such colliders are ideal experimental environments for searches for rare @xmath18 and @xmath19 decay modes and are expected to have greatly improved statistics .",
    "we find that probes of branching fractions of @xmath319 ( @xmath320 ) for @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) decays may be possible . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : cosmology ] , under the assumption that the flavor scales for these decays are naturally related to the scales for @xmath210 couplings , such precise probes are sensitive to parameter regions favored by various bbn and structure formation scenarios , where a massive unstable neutrino is motivated by possible discrepancies in cosmological data .",
    "in fact , parts of the parameter regions in such scenarios are already excluded , and future searches will be able to explore large portions of the cosmologically - favored parameter space . given the present lack of analyses studying third generation familon couplings , studies at all of these experiments , and particularly the @xmath8 factories , are strongly encouraged .    after the completion of this work , ref .",
    "@xcite appeared , in which the impact of decays @xmath415 on bbn was examined .",
