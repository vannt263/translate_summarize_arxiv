    "the existence of dark matter ( dm ) has been confirmed by its gravitational effects , and its energy fraction @xmath1 today is also measured .",
    "however , the conclusive evidences that may reveal the dm particle properties are still absent . among a variety of ( indirect ) detecting objects on dm , the gamma - ray from the dm dense region ( such as the center of the galaxy ) is especially promising by virtue of weak astrophysical influence on its propagation  @xcite . of particular interest is the monochromatic gamma - ray line , which has rather clear background .",
    "but it is highly suppressed because the dm @xmath2 can only annihilate to photons via the charged loop .",
    "however , once such a spectral line is observed , it will uncover very important information of dm . in this article ,",
    "we assume an extracted dm mass from @xmath3 and an anomalously large annihilation rate @xmath4 pb into di - photon ( it is taken as a referred value throughout the work , unless specified ) , then attempt to reconstruct the dm properties and dynmiacs to the most extent . inspired by the recent discovery of a gamma - ray line at @xmath5 gev , which is claimed in the ref .",
    "@xcite after re - analyzing the fermi large area telescope ( fermi - lat ) data published in 2009  @xcite , it is conjectured that the line may originate from dm annihilating into gamma .",
    "best fit of the data shows a dm of mass around @xmath6 gev and annihilation rate at level @xmath7 pb .",
    "later independent analysis also confirms the line  @xcite .",
    "the line has a sharper peak which is hard to explain by fermi - bubbles  @xcite , while dm+dm@xmath8 gives a better fit  @xcite .",
    "the ref .",
    "@xcite also shows a strong evidence of the gamma - ray from the inner galaxy and draws a similar conclusion .",
    "this line has received much attention from astrophysics  @xcite and particle physics  @xcite . in spite of queries  @xcite ,",
    "the gamma - ray line from dm activity itself is of great theoretical interest , and deserving a deep study .",
    "the topic can be studied in the effective theory ( eft ) framework , by minimally including an operator @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the charged particle .",
    "the anomalously bright gamma - ray line is due to large @xmath11 .",
    "we further demand the eft be compatible with other constraints on the dm , i.e. , the wmap and xenon100 bound  @xcite .",
    "independent of the mechanism generating large @xmath11 , we can arrive :    * the charged particle @xmath10 in the loop should be heavier than the dm , otherwise it would render too large annihilation rate into @xmath12 , which leads to too small dm relic density . on top of that ,",
    "the injection from such a large flux of charged particles into the cosmic - ray probably has been excluded by the pamela . *",
    "the charged particle carrying both qed and qcd charges needs careful inspections . along with the di - photon annihilating mode",
    ", there is an enhanced di - gluon mode with estimated rate @xmath13 pb , which makes an illustrative coincidence .",
    "the large @xmath11 can be generated through breit - weigner resonance mechanism , or the strong interaction between dm and the charged loop .",
    "for the former scenario , properties of the scalar / vector resonance can be further stringently restricted by symmetries , e.g.  the cp , and the above consideration .",
    "the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm )  @xcite is a good realization of this scenario .",
    "we find it is capable of interpreting the tentative 130 gev gamma - ray line .",
    "for the latter scenario , the xenon100 bound excludes the dirac dm , as well as both dirac and majorana dm if the charged paticle @xmath10 carries color .",
    "interestingly , in any scenario , the possible sm - like higgs @xmath14 to di - photon excess at the lhc  @xcite may share the same origin , if we incorporate the operator @xmath15 .",
    "this paper is organized as following : in the section  [ 2 ] , we perform a general analysis based on the minimal eft . in the next two sections exploration on the enhancement mechanism",
    "is presented .",
    "the section  [ conclusion ] includes the conclusion and discussions .",
    "and some necessary complementarity is casted in the appendix .",
    "as is well known , the dm can not directly annihilate into photons due to its qed charge neutrality , while transition at the loop level is generically highly suppressed .",
    "so , it is nontrivial to obtain an abnormally large annihilating rate , saying @xmath16 pb .",
    "some more powerful model independent statements can be made , if it is further combined with other aspects of dm . to see that , we consider the minimal effective operators   relevant to the gamma - ray line anomaly@xmath17 where the gamma matrix @xmath18 .",
    "lorentz and @xmath19 cp symmetries are implied , and some operators will vanish due to these symmetries .",
    "@xmath10 is a charged fermion and @xmath20 is a charged scalar , both of which are not confined to the sm .",
    "however , in the sense of inducing dm annihilating into gamma , the scalar loop is not as effective as the fermionic loop , unless there is a large enhancement from highly charged particles such as a double charged scalar .",
    "note that operators containing @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the charged higgs from 2hdm - like model are not included , since their contribution are always putative null , @xmath23 , in the non - linear unitary gauge the vertex @xmath24 vanishes  @xcite .    to achieve a large @xmath25 and",
    "maintain the main merit of dm dynamics , the candidates running in the charged loop are more or less selected .",
    "denoting by @xmath26 the set of dm @xmath27 annihilation mode and without loss of generality , let @xmath28 be the one from which di - photons come after closing the charged states to form a loop .",
    "some cases arise :    * if @xmath28 is the on - shell type with final states @xmath29 , then @xmath30 pb . injection from such a large flux charged particles would have been observed by pamela  @xcite from the significant excess of the positron or anti - proton flux . on top of that , the dm relic density would be too small , unless we consider the subtle thermal breit - weigner enhancement effect which is active only today  @xcite . *",
    "if @xmath28 is properly off - shell , then the above problem is resolved since the @xmath28 is forbidden today .",
    "but we have to examine its annihilation rate at the early universe , @xmath31 , comparing the rate of the forbidden annihilation mode @xmath32 with 1 pb , where @xmath33 with @xmath34 the typical decoupling temperature of dm .",
    "generically one can expand the annihilation rate as  @xcite @xmath35 where the final two - body phase space gives the velocity of out - going particles in the cm frame , @xmath36 with @xmath37 and @xmath38 the relative velocity of initial particles .",
    "for a properly large @xmath39 , the relic density of dm is  @xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41 .",
    "the relic density is very sensitive to @xmath42 , @xmath23 , from @xmath43 to @xmath44 , it increases roughly one order .",
    "but in principle it is possible to obtain @xmath4 pb and @xmath45 pb simultaneously , if we accept large fine - tuning . *",
    "if @xmath42 is large enough then the forbidden channel is completely ignorable . as a consequence ,",
    "we need a new ( dominant ) channel @xmath46 to reduce the dm number density . in actual model building",
    ", it naturally happens .",
    "but a more interesting case arises as following . *",
    "if the charged particle also carry color charge , then the @xmath47 mode is subdominant to the two gluon mode : @xmath48 which is estimated in light of fermions with unit charge , and the origin of numerical factor 0.1 can be traced back to the property of charged particles .",
    "this numerical coincidence means that if the two - gamma rate is @xmath49 pb , the right relic density is achieved via the di - gluon mode . for the proof of that the di-@xmath50 mode is at most the same order of di - photon mode and thus irrelevant , see the appendix  [ phigamma2 ] for details .",
    "generically , we will have several annihilation modes producing gamma line , @xmath51 with @xmath52 .",
    "the first mode creates a line at @xmath53 while the second mode produces a line with lower energy @xmath54 .",
    "they have comparable cross sections except for a very significant phase space suppress .",
    "therefore we focus on the two gamma final states , since the two modes quantitatively differ only by some constant , such as the difference between @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "however , how to distinguish the two lines is very interesting as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    to end up the general discussion in eft",
    ", we would like to mention that there is a possible relation between the di - phonon excess for the higgs search at the cms / atlas  @xcite and for the dm search at the sky .",
    "the common point is the new charged loop . through the same loop alone which the dm annihilates into two photons , the sm - like higgs @xmath14 can decay into two photons with appreciable width , if the coupling to the higgs is significantly .",
    "it is can be described simply by further including the effective operators @xmath57 or @xmath58 .",
    "however we are not going to discuss this in detail due to its triviality in the eft .",
    "in this section , we present the effective analysis by specifying the role of resonance . the simple top window model is constructed , and in particular we survey its implication on conventional supersymmetric model such as the nmssm .",
    "we consider the scalar resonance which appears almost everywhere in models with extended higgs sector . to get a sufficiently large enhancement ,",
    "@xmath59channel resonant annihilation is the most conventional mechanism . in this case , the resonance @xmath60 takes mass @xmath61 , and the cross section manifest of the enhancement can be parameterized as @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 . here",
    "@xmath65 stands for an effective coupling and will be specified in concrete examples , while @xmath66 takes @xmath67 or @xmath68 and so on , standing for the average of initial degree of freedoms or the symmetry factor of final states .",
    "it is convenient to define @xmath69 , then the dm annihilating cross section into @xmath70 ( thought @xmath60 ) can be rewritten as @xmath71 without loss of generality , we take @xmath72 as the dominant mode , and immediately get the upper bound of the branching ratio of @xmath60 decay ( to particles other than di - photon ) : @xmath73 to arrive it we have set @xmath74 pb as the standard annihilation rate as well as the referred value @xmath75 pb . therefore we get a model independent bound @xmath76 , as negates the resonance from simple two - higgs - doublet - model ( 2hdm ) by virtue of their considerably coupling to fermions or light massive vector boson ( it is absence for cp - odd higgs ) .",
    "this bound has far - reaching implication on the collider .",
    "provided that the production cross section of @xmath60 is sufficiently large ( for example , when the charged loop meanwhile carries color as in the top - window model discussed later ) , _ the gamma - ray line observed at the sky predicts a clear di - photon excess at the peak around 2@xmath77 gev ) at the lhc_.      in light of previous arguments , we need some rather heavy charged particles , while in the sm top quark and @xmath78 boson are the only two charged particles of mass around the weak scale .",
    "accordingly , a @xmath79 hints a new charged particle .",
    "when @xmath80 , the top quark will open a unique window .",
    "otherwise , @xmath78 may run in the charged loop provided a vertex @xmath81 , that implies nontrivially the identity of @xmath60 .    since the effective operators listed in the previous section",
    "are ascribed to the integrating out @xmath59channel scalar resonance , the set of possible operators can be reduced greatly : @xmath82 the coefficients @xmath83 s are proportional to @xmath84 . and @xmath85 in the parenthesis may or may not appear , depending on the cp quantum number of @xmath60 . but specified to fermionic dm , @xmath85 must be inserted so as to make the present dm annihilating rate avoid acute velocity suppressing , @xmath86 .",
    "this means the @xmath60 must be cp - odd , denoted as @xmath87 hereafter . as an immediate consequence",
    ", the @xmath88window is closed .",
    "additionally , @xmath89 should be understood as @xmath90 , under cp transformation @xmath91 .",
    "however , qed does not change the chirality , thus we need a further large lr mixing . as an example , the stop - system in the susy just satisfies those requirements . on the contrary , for scalar dm , no matter complex or real",
    ", the @xmath60 should be cp - even and denoted as @xmath92 .",
    "hence the @xmath85 should be removed .",
    "we would like to add some further remarks .",
    "firstly , the lorentz and sm - gauge invariance force @xmath60 either transforms non - trivially under the @xmath93 symmetry or mixes with such states . secondly , the constraint on the @xmath60 interactions indicated by the eq .",
    "( [ phi:1 ] ) should be satisfied .",
    "finally , the @xmath60 also mediates the tree - level dm - nucleon interaction in the presence of a top window .",
    "although this contribution is suppressed by velocity for the fermionic dm , the scalar dm requires inspection  @xcite .",
    "the resulting dm - proton inelastic scattering cross section is @xmath94where @xmath95 is the dm - proton reduced mass and @xmath96  @xcite .",
    "note the enhancement factor @xmath97 in @xmath98 is removed when we are calculating the dm - nucleon recoil rate using the effective operator .",
    "the present exclusion on @xmath99 is @xmath100 for dm of mass 100 gev , put by the xenon100  @xcite .",
    "it implies the upper bound @xmath101which places a rather strong constraint for the top - window model .",
    "having outlined the most essential profile of wimp that potentially has bright gamma - ray lines , we continue to make some quantitative discussion .",
    "effectively , through the charged loop , lorentz and cp invariance leads to the following operators for the cp - even and cp - odd @xmath60 respectively @xmath102 with @xmath103 .",
    "@xmath104 is the coupling constant between @xmath60 and charged particles .",
    "factoring out the loop factor and couplings , moreover multiplying @xmath105 for later convenience , the @xmath106 can be much below the weak scale ( it is even enhanced by color or electric charge ) .",
    "concrete expressions for the effective scale are casted in the appendix  [ phigamma2 ] .",
    "now we are at the position to evaluate the dm annihilation rate into gamma pair . denoting by @xmath107 the feynman rules ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : abc ] for label ) of eq .",
    "( [ phi2gamma ] ) , allowing for off - shell @xmath60 , they are respectively given by   vertex , we have make it explicitly conserves the ward - takahashi identity by symmetric the @xmath108 term . ] @xmath109,\\\\ { \\rm\\phi\\,\\,\\,cp - odd:}&\\quad \\gamma_{\\phi\\gamma\\gamma}^{\\mu\\nu}(q_1,q_2,p)=\\f{\\alpha h_{\\phi cc}}{4\\pi}\\f{1}{\\ld_2}\\epsilon^{\\mu\\nu\\alpha\\beta}(p_1)_\\alpha   ( p_2)_\\beta.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] after averaging initial states and summing over out - going photon polarization states , the resulting real scalar dm annihilation rate is @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the coupling constant between @xmath60 and dm .",
    "owing to the scalar dm , we have parameterized the massive coupling as @xmath112 .",
    "for the majorana dm , @xmath113     dark matter annihilates into @xmath47 via top loop .",
    "the cut denotes for annihilates into top pair.,width=288 ]      in the standard model ( sm ) , lying on the top of the fermion mass ascending order , the top quark may hide some new dynamics .",
    "it is thus interesting to conjecture that the dark sector may have a close relation with the top quark , @xmath31 , the dark sector only ( strongly ) interacting with top quark in the fermion sector  . then it is reasonable to expect enhanced gamma - ray line via top - loop at levels close to the present experimental sensitivity . and",
    "interesting , the latest tentative gamma - ray line from dark matter annihilation  @xcite requires a dm of mass about 130 gev , just lies within the top - window .",
    "therefore , as a concrete example of the general effective operator analysis , we focus on a top - window model equipped with scalar resonance .    due to the chiral structure of the sm , it is most likely that the @xmath60 dwells in an extra higgs doublet @xmath114 with hypercharge @xmath115 so as to couple the top quarks at dimension - four level . a simple effective model , which might be a remnant of top dynamics reads @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the ordinary higgs doublet developing a vacuum expected value ( vev ) @xmath118 gev .",
    "by contrast , @xmath114 should have a vev @xmath119 which makes the term @xmath81 neglectable  . here",
    "we assume that the vev hierarchy is realized by well organized higgs potential @xmath120 as discussed in  @xcite .",
    "in addition , since we have ascribed the unique significant coupling @xmath121 to some unknown dynamics , we are free of the fcnc - problem induced by family changing yukawa couplings @xmath122 . in summary , after the ew - breaking , we are left with the relevant terms @xmath123 in light of the general analysis , the scalar dm the @xmath60 is identified with the cp - even component of the neutral boson in @xmath114 .",
    "if we drop terms involving @xmath114 , the model just recovers the higgs - porting model ( see a recent discussion  @xcite ) .",
    "but since @xmath124 is irrelevant on our purpose , so we can turn it off to reduce parameters .",
    "now we turn our attention to the phenomenological aspects of the model .",
    "first of all , the di - photon rate , in terms of the parameterization in the eq .",
    "( [ 2gamma : scalar ] ) , is determined by @xmath125 taking @xmath126 and @xmath127 leads to a rate @xmath1280.07 pb . and the xenon100 constraint eq .",
    "( [ scalar ] ) has been arranged to be satisfied by means of rather large @xmath129 thus smaller couplings .",
    "next , the mass difference between @xmath130 and @xmath131 is at a few ten percents level , so the forbidden annihilation mode ( to top quark ) is ignorable in terms of the eq .",
    "( [ forbidden ] ) .",
    "the di - gluon mode may properly account for the relic density . from eq .",
    "( [ lds ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ qedld ] ) it is estimated that @xmath132 with @xmath133 the top quark charge .",
    "an alternative model is to assume the dark sector consists of a sm vector - like dirac fermion pair @xmath134 , which is the the @xmath93 doublet and carries hypercharge @xmath135 respectively .",
    "extra singlet fermion @xmath136 is introduced , then the model is @xmath137 the fermonic dm brings important difference .",
    "the @xmath60 should be the cp - odd component of @xmath114 , which does not couple to @xmath138 thus allows a large @xmath139 ( but we have to ensure small @xmath140 mixing , otherwise @xmath141 is too large ) .",
    "it leads to a phenomenologically viable singlet - doublet mixing majorana dm .",
    "it can be regarded as an effective model of the supersymetric model studied as the following ( but top loop will be replaced by chargino loop ) .      in the supersymmetric standard models ( ssm ) , in addition to the ( majorana ) neutralino lsp dark matter of mass around @xmath142 , a wealth of new heavy charged particles , cp - odd higgs and hence a viable resonance @xmath87 ,",
    "are furnished .",
    "it is thus of particular interest to investigate whether the above set up can be realized in the susy .",
    "furthermore , as stressed at the beginning of this section , the coupling of the resonance to light states are stringently constrained . in spite of difficulties in the minimal - ssm ,",
    "_ such an invisible @xmath87 can be readily accommodated in the nmssm following the singlet limit_. while the examination on light dark matter limit has been done  @xcite , our scenario has not been currently examined yet as far as we are aware .",

    "( c ) the highly singlet - like cp - odd higgs @xmath153 of mass around 260 gev offers a proper resonant enhancement . consequently @xmath154 and @xmath155 can be sufficiently suppressed , and its only significant coupling is to the chargino @xmath156 .",

    "concretely , the first operator gives contribution to @xmath159 in the form of eq .",
    "( [ top : dd ] ) , with  @xcite @xmath204 which implies the lower bound @xmath205 tev renders again a very small @xmath206 pb .",
    "now we can draw the conclusion : in the charged loop ported dm scenario , if we expect a large annihilation rate to gamma , xenon100 excludes both a dirac dm and colored charged loops .",
    "we would like to comment on the scalar dm case , the @xmath207 leads to contact interaction between dm and nucleon and thus safe .",
    "in fact , such model  @xcite has been recently proposed to explain the anomaly using the scalar dm .",
    "the scenarios discussed previously involve either some tuning or strong couplings , while decaying dm gives an alternative more natural choice .",
    "we close the paper by giving a short comment on this scenario to explain the fermi gamma - ray line . here , the scalar dm is more or less favored . at the two - body decay level ( three - body or more leads to too wide spectrum to account for the peak ) , the scalar dm can decay into the gamma pair while the fermionic dm can not .",
    "the unique effective operator is written as @xmath208 but this time the @xmath2 obtains a tev scale vev @xmath209 which breaks the @xmath189 symmetry and leads to the scalar dm ( the real part of @xmath2 ) decaying to gamma pair .",
    "to fit the data , besides a mass of dm should be around 260 gev , we further need its extremely narrow branching decay width to gamma pair @xmath210",
    "the small decay width can be achieved by lifting the mass of charged particles running in the loop , typically @xmath211 ( see an example in  @xcite ) : @xmath212    some comments are in orders .",
    "firstly , in our notation the @xmath213 lies below @xmath214 about two orders , but actually it may be compensated by loop factors and large yuawa couplings ( set to unit in the above estimation ) .",
    "secondly , the relic density is a generic problem for decaying dm , but non - thermal production such as ref .",
    "@xcite using freeze - in mechanism  @xcite may offer a solution .",
    "last but never the least , the 130 gev gamma - ray line in decaying dm scenario is easily compatible with the sharp excess in pamela positron fraction  @xcite , which can be interpreted by a leptonic decaying dm ( saying to @xmath215 ) with lifetime @xmath216s and mass around 200 gev . in model building",
    ", one has to introduce relevant dimension - six operators for dm decay to leptons and adjust the branching ratio to fit both datas .    for the fermionic dm , the lorentz invariance force the presence of second fermion ( in the final state ) in the operator of decay .",
    "as a case in point , in the ( lepton number violating ) @xmath217parity violating susy , the gravitino has the following two body decay modes  @xcite : @xmath218 where gravitino mass is @xmath219 gev and the branching ratios are respectively given by 0.03 , 0.69 and 0.28 .",
    "although it fails to explain both pamela and fermi gamma - ray line , the first mode can explain the latter given proper decay width .",
    "of particular interesting , the neutrino ( from the third mode ) and gamma signal appear simultaneously , and the accompanied neutrino signal may be detected and thus provides a complementary detect method for this scenario .",
    "the gamma - ray line from dm annihilating in the galaxy center generically is well below the present detectable level .",
    "however , once the observation , from it we are able to extract very important information of the dm properties / dynamics . in this work , we present a minimal effective theory framework to understand the anomalously bright gamma - ray line from dark matter activity :    * in the eft large annihilation rate is ascribed to operator coefficients with resonant or strong coupling enhancement . * due to the xenon100 bound , dirac dm or colorful charged particles are ruled out in models with only strong couplings . *",
    "if the charged particle in the loop carry @xmath220 charge , the di - gluon annihilation mode is about one order larger than the di - photon mode , that may properly account for the relic density .",
    "* the sm - like higgs may share the same charged loop , and therefore provide a source of higgs di - photon excess at the lhc .    applying the general analysis to the nmssm , that is proved to accommodate neutralino lsp with large annihilation rate into di - photon and interpret the tentative 130 gev gamma - ray line .",
    "top - window model is also proposed to explain it .",
    "although not the central points of this work , we would like to end up by commenting its very promising collider detection prospect , if the 130 gev gamma - ray line from dm activity will be confirmed . in light our general analysis in the text , at the lhc or tavertron ( but beyond lep ) one can expect new light color - singlet charged particle @xmath10 can be produced : @xmath221 .",
    "while beyond the 130 gev line and consider more wide scope , the lhc could put very strong exclusion on the model with colored loop .",

    "in the completion of this work , we note the appearance of work  @xcite , they also note the importance of the di - gluon mode in the determining of dm relic density and more relevant phenomenologies are discussed there . the ref .",
    "@xcite specifically studies the 130 gev gamma - ray line from lsp annihilation in the nmssm , taking a quite similar idea to ours .",
    "we greatly thank the authors for sending us the updated version of nmssmtools in which the cp - odd mass correctly adopts the running mass . using it",
    "we re - scan our region , and find different results than  @xcite .",
    "in this appendix we present the procedure of calculating the coefficients of the effective vertex used in the section  [ res : scalar ] , quoted for convenience : @xmath223 the calculation is similar to the case of the higgs with general couplings . for definiteness",

    "[ fig : abc ] , where cp - even resonance @xmath92 decays to gamma pair with single charged fermion running in the loop .",

    "( [ cpeven ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ adecay ] ) , we eventually get the effective suppressing scales @xmath233 where @xmath234 has been used .",
    "those expressions justify the statement that the @xmath106 can be much below the weak scale ( or @xmath131 ) .",
    "there are two other effective vertex require attention . first , if the charged particle also carries color charge , then the resonance can decay into two gluons . repeating the procedure dealing with the vertex @xmath238 and @xmath239 , the corresponding coefficients parameterized exactly as the eq .",
    "( [ phi2gamma1 ] ) except for the replacement @xmath240 and @xmath241 , we are able to get the precise effective operators .",
    "it is straightforward to get the gluonic partial decay width from direct and effective calculations : @xmath242 then we obtain the effective scales @xmath243 a few times of the values given in the eq .",
    "( [ qedld ] ) .",
    "now we turn attention to the di-@xmath50 mode . compared to the di - phonon mode",

    "presumably the resulting change is suppressed by the small parameter @xmath245 ( confirmed by the @xmath246 result  @xcite ) , then we are justified to ignore this effect at the leading order and approximately have @xmath247 the phase space suppressing factor is about 0.3 for @xmath248 gev , largely it cancels the enhancement from coupling ratio . generally the vector coupling is of the form @xmath249 with @xmath250 , here @xmath251 is the isospin quantum number of @xmath10 .",
