    "our knowledge of the nuclear interaction is steadily improving because of both the ever increasing number of experimental data and the more and more sophisticated theories which are being developed to tackle the longstanding problem of an accurate description of the strongly interacting nuclear systems .",
    "the interplay between experiments and theory is clear : interactions are built which fit the data ( typically from nucleon ",
    "nucleon scattering ) and are then tested theoretically in more complicated structures . this approach has led to the construction of nucleon  nucleon ( nn ) potentials which reproduce a huge amount of nn scattering data ( the latest versions fit @xmath41800 @xmath5 and @xmath42500 @xmath6 data with @xmath71 and break the charge independence and charge symmetry @xcite ) .",
    "however , the use of these accurate , modern nn potentials in a@xmath82 nuclei has also proved their inability to correctly describe the nuclear binding .",
    "light nuclei are underbound and the nuclear matter saturation density is not correctly reproduced by a hamiltonian containing two  nucleon forces only .",
    "several cures to these pathologies have been proposed , ranging from relativistic effects to extra degrees of freedom ( @xmath9 s ) or to many ",
    "body forces .",
    "if we choose to advocate the lack of binding to the presence of more ",
    "nucleon potentials , then the first step consists in the introduction of three  nucleon interactions ( tni ) .",
    "the knowledge of tni is by far less deep than that of the nn potential because of the considerably lower number of experimental data and of the higher difficulty in constructing theoretical models .",
    "however , even with these caveats , the present models of tni provide the correct binding for a=3,4 nuclei ( actually , tni contain parameters which are fitted on light nuclei binding energy ) and , more important and less obvious , bring the computed nuclear matter saturation density very close to its empirical value of @xmath100.16 @xmath11 .",
    "following these guidelines , one can write a realistic nuclear hamiltonian in the form : @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are two and three  nucleon potentials . the nn potential may be split into : @xmath15 where the electromagnetic part , @xmath16 contains coulomb , darwin  foldy , vacuum polarization and magnetic moments contributions ; the long range part is well established from a microscopic point of view as being given by the one pion exchange potential ( opep ) , @xmath17 ; the intermediate and short range potential , @xmath18 , arises from the exchange of more pions and heavier mesons ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) , however its microscopic derivation from meson exchange theory is troublesome ( for the larger number of feynman diagrams involved and the greater difficulty in the potential extraction ) and a phenomenological approach is often followed , consisting in a physically plausible parametrization in terms of a reasonable number of parameters .",
    "for instance , the argonne @xmath21 nn potential @xcite contains 43 parameters and it is given by a sum of 18 terms @xmath22 where the first 14 terms are isoscalar , with @xmath23\\otimes \\left[1 , { \\bf\\tau}_i\\cdot{\\bf\\tau}_j\\right]~~ ,    \\label{eq : op14}\\ ] ] and the remanining isovector and isotensor components are : @xmath24 \\left[3\\tau_{iz}\\tau_{jz}- { \\bf \\tau}_i\\cdot{\\bf \\tau}_j\\right ] , \\left[\\tau_{iz}+\\tau_{jz}\\right]~~. \\label{eq : op18}\\ ] ]    two  pion exchange gives large part of the attraction of the three  nucleon potential , whereas the remainder is mostly phenomenological .",
    "recently , attempts are being made to evaluate microscopically other pieces , as the three  pion two  delta diagram @xcite .",
    "a popular form of tni are the urbana forces @xcite , given by @xmath25 the two  pion fujita ",
    "miyazawa @xcite term , @xmath26 , is @xmath27 \\left[{\\bf\\tau}_i\\cdot{\\bf\\tau}_j,{\\bf\\tau}_i\\cdot{\\bf\\tau}_k\\right]~~ ,    \\label{eq : v2pi}\\ ] ] with @xmath28 @xmath29 and @xmath30 being the yukawa and tensor yukawa functions .",
    "the short range part , @xmath31 , is written as @xmath32 @xmath33 e @xmath34 are chosen to reproduce the binding of a=3,4 nuclei .    once a realistic hamiltonian has been built , task of the theorist is to address the ground state schroedinger equation , @xmath35 , to solve it or to find good approximations to its solutions .",
    "the exact solution is now possible in light nuclei by a variety of techniques : green s function monte carlo @xcite for 3@xmath36a@xmath368 , faddeev and faddeev ",
    "yakubovsky @xcite and correlated hyperspherical expansions ( che ) @xcite .",
    "gfmc has been pushed to the highest a  value , whereas the other approaches have been used mainly for a=3,4 .",
    "however , they are more flexible in the sense that both faddeev and correlated hyperspherical expansion methods are more easibly extendible to the study of three and four  body scattering reactions .",
    "in fact , several few  body reactions of relevant astrophysical interest have been accurately analyzed by che . for the remaining part of the nuclear table , including nuclear matter , methods to exactly solve the schroedinger equation are still to come , even if a very promising approach , based on the hubbard ",
    "stratonovich transformation , is currently under development @xcite .",
    "hence , alternative ways to gather information on the many  body wave function must be devised .",
    "the brueckner theory has brought standard perturbative theories to an extremely high level of sophistication @xcite ; the coupled cluster ( cc ) method has been used to build correlations into the wave function and is , by now , a standard technique in many  body physics @xcite ; the variational principle has provided a powerful recipe to construct accurate wave functions .    a direct consequence of the strong nuclear interaction is the failure of the mean field ( mf ) approach in the description of the nucleus . a striking evidence of this fact is provided by @xmath37 experiments @xcite where a clear signature of a depletion of the occupation probability with respect to unity for states below the fermi level , @xmath38 , ( as requested by mf theories ) is present , together with a non zero occupation probability for states above @xmath38 .",
    "this behavior may be explained in terms of short range _ dynamical correlations _",
    "( in contrast with",
    "_ statistical correlations _",
    ", due to the antisymmetry ) generated in the wave functions by the interaction and which can be hardly described by standard perturbation methods based on a non interacting basis .",
    "for instance , brueckner theory must sum infinite numbers of ladder diagrams in order to deal efficiently with the nuclear potential .    in the correlated basis function ( cbf )",
    "theory the non perturbative correlation effects are directly embedded into the basis functions .",
    "this property makes the theory a powerful tool to investigate many - body interacting systems in several fields of physics , as liquid helium , electronic structures ( both in the forms of electron fluids and lattices ) and both finite nuclei and infinite nuclear matter . the flexibility of the cbf approach results in a realistic description not only of the ground state ( energy , momentum distribution , distribution functions and so on ) but also of dynamical ( cross sections ) quantities .",
    "a set of correlated basis wave functions , @xmath39 , may be built by applying a many  body correlation operator , @xmath40 , to the model basis functions , @xmath41 , @xmath42 where the operator @xmath43 is intended to take care of the dynamical correlations , whereas the model wave functions , @xmath44 , include antisymmetrization effects and , possibly , long range correlations due to collective excitations ( as bcs type states or surface effects ) . a perturbative theory may ve developed in terms of the correlated states ( [ eq : psi_n ] ) , having the nice property of a rapid convergence and the counterindication of a large difficulty in computing the matrix elements .",
    "the zeroth order of this theory is often referred to as the _ variational _ level of cbf .",
    "in fact , the variational principle is used to fix the correlation operator by minimizing the ground state energy , @xmath45 .",
    "the choice of the correlation operator depends , to a large extent , on the interaction .",
    "a form of @xmath40 that has shown to be suitable to nuclear systems is @xmath46 _ i.e. _ a symmetrized product of two - body correlation operators , @xmath47 .",
    "the model states , @xmath41 , are slater determinants of single particle wave functions , @xmath48 , obtained by some mf potential ( simple plane waves in infinite , homogeneous matter ) .",
    "@xmath47 is chosen , consistently with the interaction , to be given by @xmath49 where the sum runs up to the spin ",
    "orbit components in eq.([eq : op14 ] ) . if the @xmath50 components are disregarded , the jastrow scalar correlation is recovered .",
    "the free minimization of @xmath51 would provide the best choice for the correlation functions @xmath52 .",
    "however , this is a prohibitive task in nuclear systems , so the correlation functions are usually parametrized and the parameters are fixed by minimizing @xmath51 .",
    "an additional minimization may be performed on the parameters of the mf model wave function .",
    "as already mentioned in the previous section , computing the matrix elements in the cbf approach represents the greatest difficulty in its application . in principle",
    "one could use monte carlo ( mc ) based algorithms to sample the occuring multi - dimensional integrals . for simple interactions and correlations",
    "this can be done even for very large numbers of particles .",
    "in such a case , the @xmath53 limit can also be studied by means of appropriate conditions at the borders of the simulation box .",
    "liquid helium , both as a fluid and as droplets , has been subject of mc investigations",
    ". however , the strong state dependence of the nuclear interaction prevents from the use of mc techniques in medium  heavy nuclei , as well as in nuclear matter .",
    "the @xmath2o ground state was studied within cbf by the cluster monte carlo ( cmc ) method @xcite , where the jastrow correlations contribution is exactly treated by mc sampling , and that from the remaining operatorial components is approximated by considering ( via mc ) up to four or five  body cluster terms .",
    "an alternative approach is provided by cluster expansions .",
    "the expectation values of operators are written in terms of @xmath54body densities , @xmath55 @xmath56 and related quantities , as the density matrices .",
    "the densities are then cluster expanded in terms of dynamical , @xmath57 ^ 2 - 1 $ ] and @xmath58 , and statistical , @xmath59 , correlations .",
    "the expansion is _ linked _ , in the sense that disconnected diagrams , given by the product of two or more pieces not connected among each other by any kind of correlation and coming from the expansion of the numerator , cancel exactly with those generated by the expansion of the denominator .",
    "however , the cluster expansion is not _",
    "irreducible _ , _ i.e. _ the surviving connected diagrams bear vertex corrections ( except for the jastrow correlation in the a=@xmath60 case , where the vertex correction is simply the density ) .",
    "the cluster diagrams are then classified into : _",
    "nodal _ , n , where all the paths between the external points ( for instance , points 1 and 2 for the two  body density of eq.([eq : rho_2 ] ) ) go through the same internal point , or _ node _ ; _ composite _ , c , given by the product of two or more nodals ; the remaining diagrams belong to the _ elementary _ class , e.    fermi hypernetted chain ( fhnc ) integral equations @xcite allow for the exact summation of the nodal and composite diagrams , in the jastrow case , once the sum of the elementary diagrams , @xmath61 , is given .",
    "so , the function @xmath61 is actually an input for solving thr fhnc equations .",
    "unfortunately , no exact way of computing this function is known and one must use approximations .",
    "the simplest one is the fhnc/0 truncation , where the choice @xmath62 is made .",
    "this seemingly crude approximation is however appropriate to nuclear systems , where the density is not very high . in denser liquid helium , a more accurate treatment of the elementary diagrams",
    "is needed .",
    "for state dependent correlations , a complete fhnc summation is possible only for the jastrow part .",
    "in fact , different orderings of the operators in the symmetrized product ( [ eq : f ] ) may give the same cluster contribution and a scheme to correctly keep track of all of them has not been devised so far .",
    "however , partial classes of diagrams containing operatorial correlations may be exactly summed by the single operator chain approximation ( fhnc / soc ) @xcite .",
    "the fhnc / soc integral equations sum all the nodal diagrams with only one operatorial correlation per internal side , besides all the jastrow correlated clusters .",
    "the accuracy of the fhnc / soc approximation has been set to @xmath41 mev / a in nuclear matter at saturation density by computing its leading corrections @xcite .",
    "the fhnc / soc scheme has been recently extended to doubly closed shell nuclei in @xmath63 coupling @xcite .    a way to control the approximations",
    "is provided by the density sum rules .",
    "in fact , the exact densities satisfy the following normalizations : @xmath64 @xmath65 @xmath66 the last equality holds for isospin saturated systems",
    ". deviations from the sum rules are a powerful check for the approximations made in the solution of the fhnc equations , both in the treatment of the elementary diagrams and of the operatorial correlations .    as a matter of fact",
    ", fhnc / soc satisfies the normalizations of the densities to a high degree of accuracy , as it is shown in table  [ tab : sumrules ] .",
    "the table gives the one  body ( s@xmath67 , eq .  ( [ eq : sr1]))and central and isospin",
    "two  body ( s@xmath68 and s@xmath69 , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : sr2],[eq : srtau ] ) density normalizations for jastrow ( @xmath70 ) and operatorial ( @xmath71 ) correlations in @xmath2o and @xmath3ca .",
    "the @xmath71 model does not contain spin ",
    "orbit components but it does have the tensor ones .",
    "the jastrow model satisfies practically exactly the sum rules , whereas the soc approximation produces discrepancies of @xmath49% in the worst case @xcite .",
    "in a series of papers @xcite we extended the fhnc formalism to doubly closed shell nuclei , both in @xmath63 and @xmath72 coupling scheme , described by jastrow correlated wave functions . in those papers model interactions were used , as the semirealistics afnan and tang ( s3 ) one @xcite .",
    "the original s3 potential is purely central , without tensor components , and reproduces the nn @xmath73waves scattering data up to @xmath460 mev .",
    "its modified version @xcite has been supplemented in the odd channels of the same repulsion as in the even ones and gives a nuclear matter binding curve close to the current realistic potentials .",
    "the correlations we adopted contained a @xmath74 dependence , allowing for distinguishing between the different nucleon pairs ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "the ground state energies for the @xmath74dependent correlations are shown in table  [ tab : nuclei_jj ] together with the experimental values .",
    "the correlations have been fixed by solving the euler equations which result from the minimization of the expectation value of the hamiltonian at the second order of the cluster expansion . given the poor quality of the interaction ,",
    "the comparison with the experiment is not really meaningful , even if not completely unsatisfactory .",
    "however , it is interesting to note a saturation trend of the binding energy along the mass number .",
    "the table also gives the energies obtained by an isospin independent correlation , identical for all the pairs ( average correlation approximation , aca ) .",
    "the poorer variational quality of the aca correlation produces higher energies than the isospin dependent model .",
    "the density normalizations are always satisfied with an accuracy greater than percent for the calculations of the table .",
    "ooooooooo    fhnc / soc has been pushed to deal with realistic potentials and state dependent , non central correlations in @xmath2o and @xmath3ca in refs.@xcite . in the last work a complete hamiltonian of the form given in eq.([eq : hamiltonian ] ) with the inclusion of the momentum dependent parts of the nn interaction and of the three ",
    "nucleon potential , as well as of the coulomb term , was adopted .",
    "table  [ tab : nuclei_a14 ] gives the g.s .",
    "energies per nucleon for two models : argonne @xmath76 + urbana vii @xcite ( a14+uvii ) and argonne @xmath77 + urbana ix @xcite ( a8+uix ) .",
    "the correlated wave function features a @xmath71 nuclear matter correlation and single particle wave functions generated by a woods  saxon mean field potential . in the a14+uvii case ,",
    "the @xmath2o fhnc / soc energies are compared with the cmc results of ref.@xcite , obtained with a similar wave function , and with the coupled cluster ones of ref.@xcite .",
    "the r.m.s .",
    "radius is also given .",
    "the variational a14+uvii energies are close to the cc estimates , while the discrepancies with cmc are due to the approximations in the fhnc / soc scheme and to small differencies in the correlation .",
    "actually , our nuclear matter euler equation does not contain the spin  orbit potential , whereas that used for the cmc correlations does .",
    "this fact produces small variations , which mostly affect the kinetic energy .",
    "fhnc and cmc give similar radii , both of them smaller than cc .",
    "explicit three  body correlations , not given by the product of two  body ones , were found to provide @xmath40.85 mev / a extra binding @xcite in the a14+uvii case .",
    "the charge densities , @xmath78 , and the two  body distribution functions , @xmath79 , computed with the a8+uix wave function are shown in figure [ fig : densities ] . the cbf @xmath78 ( dashed lines ) are folded with the proton form factor and compared with the experimental data ( solid lines ) .",
    "@xmath79 is defined as @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the center of mass coordinate .",
    "short range correlations strongly affect @xmath82 ( solid lines ) at small internucleon distances , where the nn repulsion heavily depletes the distribution functions with respect to the ipm estimates ( dashed lines ) .",
    "two  body densities are also of great interest since they allow for analyzing several integrated nuclear cross sections .",
    "in fact , the responses of a nucleus to an external probe , described by an operator @xmath83 , can be expressed in terms of the dynamical structure functions , @xmath84 , whose non energy weighted sum gives the static structure function ( ssf ) , @xmath85 . in turn , the ssf are given by expectation values of appropriate combinations of one and two  body densities .",
    "for instance , the electromagnetic longitudinal response , @xmath86 , as measured in electron  nucleus experiments , is mostly due to charge fluctuations .",
    "the corresponding ssf , @xmath87 ( or coulomb sum ) , is given by @xmath88~~ , \\label{sc_q}\\ ] ] where @xmath89 is the proton  proton two  body density .",
    "in figure [ fig : coulomb_sum ] we compare the a8+uix cbf coulomb sums with those extracted from the world data on inclusive quasi ",
    "elastic electron scattering @xcite experiments in @xmath0c , @xmath3ca , and @xmath90fe .",
    "the figure also shows the nuclear matter coulomb sum for the a14+uvii model from ref .",
    "the agreement of the nuclei theoretical ssf with the latest experimental data , which properly take into account the large energy tail of the response , is complete , whereas the nuclear matter shows some discrepancies at the lowest @xmath91 values where finite size effects appear to be still relevant .",
    "a noticeable progress in the microscopic study of the ground state structure of medium  heavy , doubly closed shell nuclei has been made in the latest years .",
    "going beyond the simple mean field picture and using realistic hamiltonians seems now to be within reach of many  body theories . in this context , the variational approach and the correlated basis function theory are among the most promising tools .",
    "fermi hypernetted chain and single operator chain techniques appear to deal with the complexity of the interaction and of the correlation with the same degree of accuracy that has been achieved in nuclear matter .",
    "this opens the field both to the microscopic study of dynamical quantitites , as the nuclei cross sections , and to the extension of the variationl method to other interesting systems , as , for instance , hypernuclei .",
