    "the study of spin - orbit ( so ) induced phenomena in semiconductor heterostructures has evolved during the last two decades into a rich research subfield of spintronics both due to the interesting fundamental physics involved@xcite and the potential applications , which span from information processing devices to quantum computation@xcite .",
    "one of the most important goals in this area consists in the local injection , transfer , manipulation and detection of spin in a controllable and coherent way , and it has been recognized that the so coupling is a particularly well - adapted tool . moreover , one expects to be able to control the spin degree of freedom using electric fields created by local voltage gates since the charge and spin degrees of freedom become coupled .",
    "the situation could allow an implementation of some spintronic devices in disordered two - dimensional electron gases ( 2deg ) based in the spin - field effect transistor@xcite or its counterpart in the quantum hall regime@xcite where one takes advantage of the existence of spin - resolved quantum hall edge channels .",
    "in 2deg at the interface of iii - v semiconductors with zincblende crystal structure there exists an intrinsic solid - state so coupling .",
    "we can distinguish two main contributions at lowest order in the momentum : rashba@xcite and dresselhaus@xcite , characterized respectively by so coupling parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 with clear and distinct physical origins .",
    "the rashba coupling arises as a consequence of the lack of structure inversion symmetry in the confining potential , while the dresselhaus coupling takes its origin in bulk inversion asymmetry and therefore just depends on the crystal lattice structure@xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the rashba coupling parameter @xmath0 is proportional to the gradient of the potential in the perpendicular direction ( being tunable by external voltage gates@xcite ) , while the dresselhaus parameter @xmath1 is only sensitive to deep changes in the crystal - lattice affecting the structural integrity of the heterostructure .",
    "both rashba and dresselhaus contributions may be present in a given semiconductor heterostructure and which of them is dominant depends on material parameters and the perpendicular potential gradients@xcite .",
    "for instance , one usually has pure dresselhaus coupling in gaas , or pure rashba coupling in insb , while both can equally contribute in inas .",
    "the particular situation affecting a specific heterostructure can be experimentally determined using weak localization to antilocalization transitions@xcite or photocurrent measurements of the angular distribution of the spin density@xcite .",
    "the rashba parameter @xmath0 has been estimated by an analysis of the nodes of the beating patterns in the shubnikov - de haas oscillations of the longitudinal magnetoresistance under magnetic fields in ingaas / inalas ( ref . ) and hgte@xcite .",
    "quite recently , it has also been determined by scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) in insb surface gases@xcite at high magnetic fields , with an extraction of the coupling constant @xmath0 from the positions of the nodes of the density of states ( dos ) .",
    "importantly , the sts technique gives primarily access to the _ local _ density of states ( ldos ) , and thus provides an opportunity to reveal the spatial fluctuations of the so coupling parameter on a local scale .",
    "indeed , random spatial fluctuations of the rashba so coupling are naturally expected in semiconductor heterostructures , because the electric field perpendicular to the well is created by dopant ions whose concentration unavoidably fluctuates spatially @xcite .",
    "therefore , the electron motion in the 2deg is affected , in principle , by two different kinds of disorder , which are _ a priori _ locally uncorrelated : the electrostatic ( in - plane ) disorder potential @xmath2 acting on the charge motion , and a fluctuating so rashba coupling @xmath3 . these fluctuations in the rashba coefficient are known to influence the spin dynamics under weak but classical magnetic fields by inducing memory effects for the spin relaxation@xcite .",
    "recent sts measurements by morgenstern _",
    "@xcite in insb surface gases at high magnetic fields ( within the quantum hall regime ) have shown that the energy spin splitting indeed varies spatially , what one could naively directly attribute to spatial fluctuations of the rashba coupling .",
    "more precisely , a spin - split ldos has been clearly observed only when the tip position is located close to the local extrema of the disorder potential , the energy spin splitting being typically@xcite larger at hills of the potential landscape ( close to local maxima ) , and smaller at valleys ( near minima ) . in regions where the gradients of the potential landscape are strong , the energy spin splitting",
    "could not be determined due to the enlarged linewidth of the ldos .",
    "in this paper we provide a simple explanation for this observed puzzling correlation@xcite between the spatial dispersion of the spin splitting and the disorder potential landscape .",
    "we stress that these recent sts measurements have been performed at high magnetic fields in the quantum hall regime , an important aspect which has to be carefully taken into account within the theoretical interpretation of the ldos characteristic features .",
    "numerous theoretical works have already considered the spectral properties of 2deg with a uniform rashba so coupling in strong quantizing magnetic fields . under these conditions , it is required to include in the description the zeeman coupling , which also contributes to the energy spin splitting .",
    "the resulting energy levels in the absence of potential energy are known since several decades@xcite , with the result    @xmath4 . \\label{llpure}\\ ] ]    here @xmath5 is an integer and @xmath6 is the so index which corresponds to two different projections along the rashba dependent spin axis ( note that for @xmath7 , only the projection @xmath8 is allowed ) .",
    "the corresponding eigenstates have a spinorial structure composed out of adjacent landau level states which are associated with quantizations of the electronic cyclotron orbits in a magnetic field .",
    "the dominant energy scale at high magnetic fields is the cyclotron energy @xmath9 .",
    "the energy levels depend through the so index @xmath10 on two other energy scales appearing in eq .",
    "( [ llpure ] ) via the dimensionless quantities @xmath11 and @xmath12 which characterize the rashba so coupling and the zeeman interaction , respectively .",
    "the explicit microscopic expressions for these quantities are provided in sec .",
    "an obvious effect of the so coupling is to generate non - equidistant energy levels .",
    "moreover , the competition between the zeeman and so couplings leads to interesting effects for the energy spin splitting .",
    "indeed , two nearby energy levels with opposite index @xmath10 can even become arbitrarily close and , at special values of the quantity @xmath11 which depends on the magnetic field , the spin gap may vanish , giving rise to an accidental double degeneracy .",
    "these particular degeneracy points have been previously related both to resonances in the spin hall conductance in the absence of disorder@xcite and to the beating pattern of the dos@xcite .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the energy levels ( [ llpure ] ) in the pure case present also a large degeneracy with respect to the guiding center location ( in other terms , the center of the cyclotron orbit ) , independently of the strengths of the zeeman and so couplings .",
    "all the degeneracies within the energy spectrum are expected to be lifted in the presence of a random potential energy . in this work",
    ", we shall essentially address the associated fine structure of the energy levels , i.e. , we shall study in a quantitative way how the energy spectrum ( [ llpure ] ) is modified by the presence of an arbitrary potential energy varying smoothly in space .",
    "note that , contrary to the dos , a proper description of the ldos behavior also requires to know in precise terms the wave functions in addition to the energy spectrum .",
    "the theory developed in this paper shows how it is possible to devise a controlled approximate solution for the electronic states in the peculiar high magnetic field regime .    as a warming up , it is always instructive to consider toy models assuming a potential energy with a simple spatial dependence . unfortunately , most of the simplest models are not tractable quantum mechanically in a fully analytical form and one has often to resort to numerical simulations to get some physical insight . for the hard - wall potential ,",
    "there are theoretical studies using either a wave function formalism@xcite or semiclassical approaches based on su(@xmath13 ) ( spin ) coherent states@xcite , with numerical studies mostly available in the literature@xcite .",
    "the one - dimensional ( 1d ) parabolic model for confinement is also not fully analytically tractable in the presence of an external magnetic field and both rashba and zeeman interactions .",
    "this toy model for the edge states in the regime of the integer quantum hall effect has been studied using numerical techniques@xcite or analytically but without properly controlled approximation schemes@xcite .",
    "two - dimensional quadratic confining potentials have also been investigated , only numerically , as models for semiconductor quantum dots@xcite .",
    "the above - mentioned theoretical works have not specifically addressed the regime of the quantum hall effect , for which the smooth disorder in the 2deg plays a crucial role by producing both localized and delocalized electronic states .",
    "these disorder effects can be well captured within a semi classical picture@xcite involving a natural decomposition of the electronic motion in terms of a rapid cyclotronic motion and a slow drift of the guiding center . at high magnetic fields ,",
    "these two kinds of motions decouple , constraining the guiding center to follow the equipotential lines of the disordered electrostatic potential . as a result ,",
    "most of the states are localized , since the disordered potential landscape is principally constituted by closed equipotential lines .",
    "delocalization of the electronic states throughout the system is then only possible by following an extended percolating backbone occurring at a single critical energy and passing through many saddle points of the disorder landscape.@xcite    a hallmark of this high magnetic field regime is thus the strong reduction of the communication between the cyclotronic and guiding center degrees of freedom , which corresponds to neglecting landau level mixing in a quantum - mechanical picture . at the technical level ,",
    "the projection within a single landau level has been mainly presented in the literature@xcite for the lowest landau level , by exploiting the analyticity properties of the wave functions .",
    "the generalization of this wave function technique for the landau levels @xmath14 has been formulated @xcite 20 years later , at the price of numerous complications . in the recent years",
    ", an alternative projection technique has been developed by two of us in the language of semi - coherent vortex green s functions@xcite .",
    "this vortex approach appears more general because it treats all the landau levels on an equal footing , and allows one also , in principle , to include perturbatively the mixing between the landau levels .",
    "it relies on a very basic idea , namely , the introduction of the orbital and guiding center degrees of freedom in the quantum realm by working preferentially with a basis of eigenstates ( in the pure case ) characterized by two quantum numbers @xmath15 and @xmath16 . the degeneracy quantum number @xmath17 corresponds to the guiding center position in a classical picture and labels the location in the plane of the zeros of the wave function ( via a coherent states algebra ) .",
    "the vortex theory is then nothing else but the translation in the quantum - mechanical language of the decomposition of the electronic motion into a fast cyclotronic rotation and a slow guiding center drift .",
    ", one recovers the usual spin indices @xmath18 ) .",
    "the probability density is peaked along two circles with cyclotron radii @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( the latter associated to the components @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively ) .",
    "the thick circles represent the dominant contribution to the probability density , while the thin circles correspond to the sub - dominant one .",
    "for non - zero so coupling , each of the components of the spinor is sensitive to different averages of the disorder potential along the orbits , due to the differences in the probability density .",
    "this leads to a simple mechanism responsible for disorder potential - driven spatial fluctuations of the energy spin splitting.,scaledwidth=43.0% ]    a substantial part of this paper is a generalization of this vortex approach by taking into account in the quantum - mechanical formalism both the charge and spin degrees of freedom , and , especially , their mutual coupling via the so interaction .",
    "indeed , a direct application of the previous results@xcite is not possible _ stricto sensu _ , because the so coupling leads to a specific spinorial form for the wave functions in the pure case , which requires the introduction of a new kind of vortex states . from the geometric point of view , these so vortex states labeled by the quantum numbers @xmath23 present a probability density characterized by two maxima peaked along the cyclotron orbits of two adjacent spin - resolved landau levels as represented in fig .",
    "1(b ) . the different radii collapse into a single one @xmath24 in the limit of vanishing so coupling as shown in fig",
    ". 1(a ) and the spinor structure of the states becomes trivial .",
    "this already suggests a simple physical picture to understand the role of disorder in quantum hall systems with so coupling : each of the components of the spinor is sensitive to different effective disorder potentials which result from the averaging of the potential energy along distinct cyclotron orbits , and the interplay between the two components gives the characteristic hallmarks of quantum hall systems with rashba and zeeman couplings .",
    "the theory developed here provides an analytical derivation of this mechanism for disorder potential - driven spatial fluctuations of the energy spin splitting in the framework of a semi - coherent states green s function formalism . as a simple estimation ,",
    "we obtain in a weak so coupling limit @xmath25 in the case @xmath26 ( situation for insb ) an energy spin splitting [ between the lowest - energy states @xmath27 and @xmath28 given by @xmath29 with @xmath30 the magnetic length and @xmath31 the laplacian of the potential energy function taken with respect to the guiding center position . expression ( [ peaksgaps ] ) shows that nontrivial features appear due to the interplay between rashba so coupling , zeeman interaction and smooth disorder .",
    "the resulting overall energy spin splitting appears well correlated with the disorder potential landscape , with a larger splitting obtained near the potential hills [ where typically @xmath32 than near the potential valleys [ where @xmath33 .",
    "smooth random fluctuations in the so coupling parameter give rise to another mechanism for a spatial dispersion of the spin splitting , which will be also accounted for within our green s function formalism .",
    "the analytical expressions for the energy spectrum and the ldos derived in this paper should be very helpful for a future thorough comparison between theory and sts experiments , in particular in order to quantify local fluctuations of rashba so coupling . we can nevertheless point out that the experimentally noticed@xcite correlation between the spatial dispersion of the energy spin splitting and the local extrema of the potential landscape in insb rather suggests that the contribution from the rashba so coupling fluctuations is seemingly less important than that induced by the spatial fluctuations of the disordered potential .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , in sec . [ spin_vortex_sec ] we introduce the so vortex states , which are peculiar eigenstates of the free electron hamiltonian under perpendicular homogeneous magnetic fields in the presence of uniform rashba and zeeman interactions .",
    "these states forming an overcomplete basis of semicoherent spinors constitute the elementary units for the developed theory . in sec .",
    "[ green_function_sec ] we introduce the green s function formalism using the so vortex states and obtain the general equations of motion for the green s function including energy level mixing processes in the presence of disorder and fluctuations of the rashba so parameter .",
    "these equations , which can be related to a deformation quantization formulation of quantum mechanics , are then solved in the limit of negligible coupling between energy levels in sec .",
    "[ spectrum_sec ] for electronic drift states . as a result",
    ", we obtain the energy spectrum for arbitrary locally flat potentials in the presence of smooth fluctuations of the rashba so coupling parameter , the formula becoming exact for globally flat potentials with zero gaussian curvature .",
    "furthermore , we present in this sec .",
    "[ spectrum_sec ] simple analytical estimations of the spatial dispersion between arbitrary spin - split energy sublevels . finally , in sec .",
    "[ ldos_sec ] , we use the green s function obtained in sec .",
    "[ spectrum_sec ] to analytically compute the ldos in the quantum hall regime in the presence of a smooth arbitrary disorder , which can be described by locally flat potentials and smooth rashba fluctuations .",
    "this allows us to determine the spatial dispersion and the linewidth of the ldos peaks in different temperature regimes .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we first introduce the vortex states in the spinless case@xcite . they will be useful to construct the elementary components in the presence of so coupling , upon which the whole green s function theory relies .",
    "we thus consider the hamiltonian for a single spinless electron of effective mass @xmath34 and electric charge @xmath35 confined in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) plane in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field @xmath36 : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the gauge - invariant momentum operator written in the position representation [ here @xmath39 describes the position of the electron in the 2d plane and @xmath40 is the speed of light ] and @xmath41 is the electromagnetic vector potential related to the magnetic field by the usual constitutive relation @xmath42 .",
    "the eigenvalue problem for hamiltonian , @xmath43 , gives the well - known landau spectrum characterized by discrete energy levels @xmath44 with @xmath45 a positive integer and @xmath46 the cyclotron pulsation .",
    "the energy levels , labeled by the landau level index @xmath15 , have a purely topological origin related to the quantization of the magnetic flux enclosed by the cyclotron orbits induced by the lorentz force on the charged particles ( or , correspondingly , the quantization due to self - interference in the electronic circular motion ) .",
    "accordingly , @xmath15 can be interpreted as the number of magnetic flux quanta @xmath47 enclosed by the cyclotron trajectory .",
    "the landau levels , @xmath48 , are infinitely degenerate since the motion of the electron has two degrees of freedom ( we thus expect here two quantum numbers to be involved ) .",
    "this means that there is a great liberty in the choice of the basis states which diagonalize the hamiltonian in eq . , the particular choice depending on the symmetry of the gauge - invariant probability density @xmath49 . imposing the probability density to be a function of @xmath50 only , so that it reflects the classical orbital motion of the electron around a guiding center @xmath16 , we obtain the set of overcomplete vortex states@xcite which are expressed in the symmetrical gauge @xmath51 as @xmath52^{n } \\\\ \\times    \\exp \\left[-\\dfrac{(x - x)^2+(y - y)^2 + 2i(yx - xy)}{4l_{b}^{2}}\\right],\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is the magnetic length .",
    "the vortex states , which can be written as @xmath54 in the dirac notation , are characterized by the set of quantum numbers @xmath55 .",
    "they are so called because the continuous quantum number @xmath56 characterizes ( for @xmath57 ) the position of the zeros of the wave function , which corresponds to vortex - like phase singularities in the 2d plane .",
    "the eigenstates @xmath58 form a peculiar semicoherent basis , since they satisfy the coherent states algebra with respect to the continuous ( degeneracy ) quantum number @xmath59 . as a consequence , they are orthogonal with respect to the landau level index but non - orthogonal with respect to the vortex position .",
    "they form a semiorthogonal basis with the overlap @xmath60 where @xmath61}.\\ ] ] importantly , they obey the following completeness relation @xmath62 which allows us to project the 2d electron dynamics within this vortex representation .",
    "the vortex basis also provides considerable advantages in order to describe the lifting of the energy degeneracy by an arbitrary ( smooth ) potential landscape @xmath63 , since the degeneracy quantum number does not result from a particular symmetry , in contrast to the landau states basis expressing a translation invariance , or the circular states basis characterized by a global rotation invariance .",
    "more precisely , the degeneracy in the vortex representation is grasped from a differential geometry perspective via the continuous position @xmath16 , which avoids to define the specific shape of the quantum cell . as a result",
    ", the vortex states are characterized by a great local adaptability to random spatial variations of the potential energy , i.e. , they display some robustness properties in response to arbitrary local perturbations .",
    "this is the basic reason why they are chosen as a preferred set of states to deal with a realistic description of disorder effects .",
