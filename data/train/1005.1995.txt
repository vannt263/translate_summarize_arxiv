    "the _ integral _ observatory is an esa satellite launched on 17 october 2002 by a proton rocket on an excentric orbit .",
    "it is hosting 4 instruments : 2 @xmath0-ray coded - mask telescopes the imager ibis and the spectro - imager spi , observing in the range 10 kev-10 mev , with a resolution of @xmath1 and a field - of - view of @xmath2 a coded - mask telescope jem - x ( 3 - 100 kev ) , and an optical telescope ( omc ) .",
    "the @xmath0-ray sky seen by _ integral _ is very rich , since 499 sources have been detected by _ integral _ , reported in the @xmath3 ibis / isgri soft @xmath0-ray catalogue , spanning 3.5 years of observations in the 20 - 100 kev domain @xcite .",
    "214 sources were discovered by _ integral _ , while the remaining 285 were already known . among these sources , there are 147 xrbs ( representing 29% of the whole sample of sources detected by _",
    "integral _ , called `` igrs '' in the following ) , 163 agns ( 33% ) , 27 cvs ( 5% ) , and 20 sources of other type ( 4% ) : 12 snrs , 2 globular clusters , 2 sgrs and 1 grb .",
    "129 objects still remain unidentified ( 26% ) .",
    "xrbs are separated in 82 lmxbs and 78 hmxbs ( each category represents 16% of igrs ) . among the hmxbs",
    ", there are 24 bexbs and 19 sgxbs ( representing respectively 31% and 24% of hmxbs ) .",
    "it is interesting to follow the evolution of the ratio between bexbs and sgxbs . during the pre-_integral _ era ,",
    "hmxbs were mostly bexbs systems .",
    "for instance , in the catalogue of 130 hmxbs by @xcite , there were 54 bexbs and 7 sgxbs ( respectively 42% and 5% of the total number of hmxbs ) .",
    "then , the situation changed with the first hmxbs identified by _ integral _ : in the catalogue of 114 hmxbs ( + 128 in magellanic clouds ) of @xcite , there were 60% of bexbs and 32% of sgxbs firmly identified .",
    "therefore , while the ratio of bexbs / hmxbs increased by a factor of 1.5 only , the one of sgxbs / hmxbs increased by a factor of 6 .",
    "the isgri detector on the ibis imager has performed a detailed survey of the galactic plane , discovering many new high energy celestial objects , most of which reported in @xcite .",
    "the most important result of _ integral _ to date is the discovery of many new high energy sources  concentrated in the galactic plane , mainly towards tangential directions of galactic arms , rich in star forming regions ,  exhibiting common characteristics which previously had rarely been seen ( see e.g. @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "many of them are hmxbs hosting a ns orbiting around an ob companion , in most cases a supergiant star .",
    "nearly all the _ integral _ hmxbs for which both spin and orbital periods have been measured are located in the upper part of the corbet diagramme @xcite .",
    "they are wind accretors , typical of supergiant hmxbs , and x - ray pulsars exhibiting longer pulsation periods and higher absorption ( by a factor @xmath4 ) as compared to the average of previously known hmxbs @xcite .",
    "they divide into two classes : some are very obscured , exhibiting a huge intrinsic and local extinction , the most extreme example being the highly absorbed source igr  j16318 - 4848 @xcite , and the others are hmxbs hosting a supergiant star and exhibiting fast and transient outbursts  an unusual characteristic among hmxbs .",
    "these are therefore called supergiant fast x - ray transients ( sfxts , @xcite @xcite ) , with igr  j17544 - 2619 being their archetype @xcite .      to better characterise this population",
    ", @xcite and @xcite studied a sample of 21 igrs belonging to both classes described above .",
    "sources of this sample are x - ray pulsars , with high @xmath5 from 139 to 5880s and @xmath6 ranging from 4 to 14days .",
    "they are therefore wind accreting supergiant hmxbs , according to the corbet diagramme .",
    "the multiwavelength observations were performed from 2004 to 2008 at the european southern observatory ( eso ) , using target of opportunity ( too ) and visitor modes , in 3 domains : optical ( @xmath7 nm ) with emmi , nir ( @xmath8 ) with sofi , both instruments at the focus of the 3.5 m new technology telescope ( ntt ) at la silla , and mid - infrared ( mir , @xmath9 ) with the visir instrument on melipal , the 8 m unit telescope 3 ( ut3 ) of the very large telescope ( vlt ) at paranal ( chile ) .",
    "they also used data from the glimpse survey of _ spitzer_. with these observations they performed accurate astrometry , identification , photometry and spectroscopy on this sample of igrs , aiming at identifying their counterparts and the nature of the companion star , deriving their distance , and finally characterising the presence and temperature of their circumstellar medium , by fitting their spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "the main results of this study are that 15 of these igrs are identified as hmxbs , and among them 12 hmxbs contain massive and luminous early - type companion stars . by combining optical , nir and mir photometry , and fitting their seds",
    ", @xcite showed that ( i ) most of these sources exhibit an intrinsic absorption and ( ii ) three of them exhibit a mir excess , which they suggest to be due to the presence of a cocoon of dust and/or cold gas enshrouding the whole binary system , with a temperature of @xmath10k , extending on a radius of @xmath11 ( see @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "sfxts constitute a new class of @xmath12 sources identified among the recently discovered igrs .",
    "they are hmxbs hosting ns orbiting around sgob companion stars , exhibiting peculiar characteristics compared to `` classical '' hmxbs : rapid outbursts lasting only for hours , faint quiescent emission , and high energy spectra requiring a bh or ns accretor .",
    "the flares rise in tens of minutes , last for @xmath13 1 hour , their frequency is @xmath14days , and their luminosity @xmath15 at the outburst peak .",
    "this bright recurrent transient x - ray source was discovered by _",
    "integral _ on 17 september 2003 @xcite .",
    "_ xmm - newton _ observations showed that it exhibits a very hard x - ray spectrum , and a relatively low intrinsic absorption ( @xmath16 , @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "its bursts last for hours , and inbetween bursts it exhibits long quiescent periods , which can reach more than 70days .",
    "the x - ray behaviour is complex on long , mean and short - term timescales : rapid flares are detected by _",
    "integral _ on all these timescales , on pointed and 200s binned lightcurve ( zurita heras & chaty in prep . ) .",
    "the compact object is probably a ns @xcite .",
    "@xcite managed to get optical / nir too observations only one day after the discovery of this source .",
    "they identified a likely counterpart inside the _ xmm - newton _ error circle , confirmed by an accurate localization from _",
    "chandra_. spectroscopy showed that the companion star was a blue supergiant of spectral type o9ib , with a mass of @xmath17 , a temperature of @xmath18  k , and a stellar wind velocity of @xmath19 ( which is faint for o stars ) : the system is therefore an hmxb @xcite . @xcite",
    "combined optical , nir and mir observations and showed that they could accurately fit the observations with a model of an o9ib star , with a temperature @xmath20  k and a radius @xmath21 .",
    "they derived an absorption a@xmath22 and a distance d  @xmath23  kpc .",
    "therefore the source does not exhibit any mir excess , it is well fitted by a unique stellar component ( see figure [ figure : igrj16318-igrj17544 ] , right panel , @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "we can divide the sfxts in two groups , according to the duration and frequency of their outbursts , and their @xmath24 ratio . the classical sfxts exhibit a very low quiescence @xmath25 and a high variability , while intermediate sfxts exhibit a higher @xmath26 , a lower @xmath24 and a smaller variability , with longer flares .",
    "sfxts might appear like persistent sgxbs with @xmath26 below the canonical value of @xmath27 , and flares superimposed .",
    "but there might be some observational bias in these general characteristics , therefore the distinction between sfxts and sgxbs is not well defined yet . while the typical hard x - ray variability factor ( the ratio between deep quiescence and outburst flux ) is less than 20 in classical / absorbed systems , it is higher than 100 in sfxts ( some sources can exhibit flares in a few minutes , like for instance xtej1739 - 302 & igrj17544 - 2619 ) . the intermediate sfxts exhibit smaller variability factors .",
    "+    such sharp rises exhibited by sfxts are incompatible with the orbital motion of a compact object through a smooth medium ( @xcite @xcite , @xcite @xcite , @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "instead , flares must be created by the interaction of the accreting compact object with the dense clumpy stellar wind ( representing a large fraction of stellar @xmath28 ) . in this case , the flare frequency depends on the system geometry , and the quiescent emission is due to accretion onto the compact object of diluted inter - clump medium , explaining the very low quiescence level in classical sfxts .",
    "+    each sfxt outburst is due to the accretion of a single clump , assuming that the x - ray lightcurve is a direct tracer of the wind density distribution .",
    "the typical parameters in this scenario are : a compact object with large orbital radius : @xmath29 , a clump size of a few tenths of @xmath30 , a clump mass of @xmath31 ( for @xmath32 ) , a mass loss rate of @xmath33 , a clump separation of order @xmath34 at the orbital radius , and a volume filling factor : 0.02@xmath350.1 .",
    "the flare to quiescent count rate ratio is directly related to the @xmath36 density ratio , which ranges between 15 - 50 for intermediate sfxts , and @xmath37 for `` classical '' sfxts . a very high degree of porosity ( macroclumping )",
    "is required to reproduce the observed outburst frequency in sfxts , in good agreement with uv line profiles and line - driven instabilities at large radii ( @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "+    to explain the emission of sgxb / sfxt , @xcite and @xcite invoke the existence of two zones around the supergiant star , of high and low clump density respectively .",
    "this would naturally explain the smooth transition between sgxbs and sfxts , and the existence of intermediate systems ; the main difference between classical sgxbs and sfxts being in this scenario the ns orbital radius .",
    "indeed , a basic model of porous wind predicts a substantial change in the properties of the wind `` seen by the ns '' at a distance @xmath38 ( @xcite @xcite ) , where we stop seeing persistent x - ray sources .",
    "there are 2-regimes : either the ns sees a large number of clumps , because it is embedded in a quasi - continuous wind ; or the number density of clumps is so small that the ns is effectively orbiting in an empty space .",
    "the observed division between sgxbs ( persistent sgxbs and sfxts ) is therefore naturally explained by simple geometrical differences in the orbital configurations :    \\1 .",
    "the obscured sgxbs ( persistent and luminous systems ) would have short and circular orbits lying inside the zone of stellar wind high clump density ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "the intermediate sfxts would have short orbits , circular or eccentric , and possible periodic outbursts , the ns being inside the narrow transition zone .",
    "the classical sfxts would have larger and eccentric orbital radius , the ns orbiting outside the high density zone .",
    "+    x - ray properties of this system were suggesting an sfxt @xcite , exhibiting however an unusual behaviour : its outbursts last for a few days ( to compare to hours for classical sfxts ) , and the ratio @xmath40 ( its quiescence is therefore at a higher level than the ratio @xmath41 for classical sfxts ) . moreover ,",
    "its orbital period @xmath6=18.5d is low compared to classical sfxts ( with large / eccentric orbits ) . finally , its orbital and spin periods ( @xmath5=21.05s ) located it ambiguously inbetween be and sgxbs in the corbet diagramme .",
    "@xcite identified the companion star of this system as a b0.5ia supergiant , unambiguously showing that this system is an sfxt . furthermore , they suggest that this system could be the first firmly identified intermediate sfxt , characterised by short , eccentric orbit ( with an eccentricity @xmath42 between 0.4 and 0.6 ) , and long outbursts ... an `` intermediate '' sfxt nature would explain the unusual characteristics of this source among `` classical '' sfxts .",
    "igr  j16318 - 4848 was the first source discovered by ibis / isgri on _ integral _ on 29 january 2003 @xcite , with a @xmath43 uncertainty .",
    "_ xmm - newton _ observations revealed a comptonised spectrum exhibiting an unusually high level of absorption : @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "the accurate localisation by _ xmm - newton _ allowed @xcite to rapidly trigger too photometric and spectroscopic observations in optical / nir , leading to the confirmation of the optical counterpart @xcite and to the discovery of the nir one @xcite .",
    "the extremely bright nir source ( b@xmath45 ; i@xmath46 , j@xmath47 ; h@xmath48 and ks@xmath49 ) exhibits an unusually strong intrinsic absorption in the optical ( @xmath50 ) , 100 times stronger than the interstellar absorption along the line of sight ( @xmath51 ) , but still 100 times lower than the absorption in x - rays .",
    "this led @xcite to suggest that the material absorbing in x - rays was concentrated around the compact object , while the material absorbing in optical / nir was enshrouding the whole system .",
    "the nir spectroscopy in the @xmath52 domain allowed them to identify the nature of the companion star , by revealing an unusual spectrum , with many strong emission lines :    @xmath53 h , he@xmath54 ( p - cyg ) lines , characteristic of dense / ionised wind at v@xmath55km / s ,    @xmath53 he@xmath56 lines : the signature of a highly excited region ,    @xmath53 @xmath57fe@xmath58 $ ] : reminiscent of shock heated matter ,    @xmath53 fe@xmath56 : emanating from media of densities @xmath59@xmath60 ,    @xmath53 na@xmath54 : coming from cold / dense regions .",
    "all these lines originate from a highly complex , stratified circumstellar environment of various densities and temperatures , suggesting the presence of an envelope and strong stellar outflow responsible for the absorption .",
    "only luminous early - type stars such as sgb[e ] show such extreme environments , and @xcite concluded that igr  j16318 - 4848 was an unusual hmxb hosting a sgb[e ] with characteristic luminosity of @xmath61 and mass of @xmath62 , located at a distance between 1 and 6 kpc ( see also @xcite @xcite )",
    ". this source would therefore be the second hmxb hosting a sgb[e ] star , after ci cam ( see @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "the question of this huge absorption was still pending , and only mir observations would allow to solve this question , and understand its origin . by combining optical , nir and mir observations , and fitting these observations with a model of sgb[e ] companion star , @xcite showed that igr  j16318 - 4848 was exhibiting a mir excess ( see figure [ figure : igrj16318-igrj17544 ] , left panel ) , that they interpreted as due to the strong stellar outflow emanating from the sgb[e ] companion star .",
    "they found that the companion star had a temperature of @xmath63k and radius @xmath64a.u .",
    ", consistent with a supergiant star , and an extra component of temperature t @xmath65k and radius r@xmath66a.u .",
    ", with a@xmath67 .",
    "recent mir spectroscopic observations with visir at the vlt showed that the source was exhibiting strong emission lines of h , he , ne , pah , si , proving that the extra absorbing component was made of dust and cold gas .    by taking a typical orbital period of 10days and a mass of the companion star of @xmath68",
    ", we obtain an orbital separation of @xmath69 , smaller than the extension of the extra component of dust / gas ( @xmath70 ) , suggesting that this dense and absorbing circumstellar material envelope enshrouds the whole binary system , like a cocoon ( see figure [ figure : obscured - sfxt ] , left panel ) .",
    "we point out that this source exhibits such extreme characteristics that it might not be fully representative of the other obscured sources .      in view of the results described above",
    ", there seems to be a continuous trend , from classical and/or absorbed sghmbs , to classical sfxts .",
    "we outline in the following this trend .    \\1 . in `` classical '' sgxbs ,",
    "the ns is orbiting at a few stellar radii only from the star .",
    "the absorbed ( or obscured ) sgxbs ( like igrj16318 - 4848 ) are classical sgxbs hosting ns constantly orbiting inside a cocoon made of dust and/or cold gas , probably created by the companion star itself .",
    "these systems therefore exhibit a persistent x - ray emission . the cocoon , with an extension of @xmath71a.u . , is enshrouding the whole binary system .",
    "the ns has a small and circular orbit ( see figure [ figure : obscured - sfxt ] , left panel ) .",
    "\\2 . in `` intermediate '' sfxt systems ( such as igrj18483 - 0311 ) , the ns orbits on a small and circular / excentric orbit , and it is only when the ns is close enough to the supergiant star that accretion takes place , and that x - ray emission arises .    \\3 . in `` classical '' sfxts ( such as igrj17544 - 2619 ) ,",
    "the ns orbits on a large and excentric orbit around the supergiant star , and exhibits some recurrent and short transient x - ray flares , while it comes close to the star , and accretes from clumps of matter coming from the wind of the supergiant .",
    "because it is passing through more diluted medium , the @xmath72 ratio is higher for `` classical '' sfxts than for `` intermediate '' sfxts ( see figure [ figure : obscured - sfxt ] , right panel ) .",
    "although this scenario seems to describe quite well the characteristics currently seen in sgxbs , we still need to identify the nature of many more sgxbs to confirm it , and in particular the orbital period and the dependance of the column density with the phase of the binary system .",
    "these sources revealed by _ integral _ , namely the supergiant hmxbs , will allow to better constrain and understand the formation and evolution of binary systems , by comparing them to numerical study of lmxb / hmxb population synthesis models .",
    "for instance , these new systems might represent a precursor stage of what is known as the `` common envelope phase '' in the evolution of lmxb / hmxb systems .",
    "many parameters do influence the various evolutions of these systems : differences in size , orbital period , ages , accretion type , and stellar endpoints ... moreover , stellar and circumstellar properties also influence the evolution of high - energy binary systems , made of two massive components usually born in rich star forming regions",
    ". we still have to identify black holes orbiting around supergiant companion stars in wind - accreting hmxbs , however this is only feasible through observational methods involving detection of extremely faint radial velocity displacement due to the high mass of the companion star .",
    "finally , these sources are also useful to look for massive stellar `` progenitors '' , for instance giving birth to coalescence of compact objects , through ns / ns or ns / bh collisions .",
    "they would then become prime candidate for gravitational wave emitters , or even to short / hard @xmath0-ray bursts .",
    "the _ integral _ satellite has tripled the total number of galactic sgxbs , constituted of a ns orbiting around a supergiant star .",
    "most of these new sources are slow and absorbed x - ray pulsars , exhibiting a large @xmath73 and long @xmath5 ( @xmath131ks ) .",
    "the influence of the local absorbing matter on periodic modulations is different for sgob or bexbs , segregated in different parts of @xmath73-@xmath6 or @xmath73-@xmath5 . _ integral _ revealed 2 new types of sources .",
    "first , the sfxts , exhibiting short and strong x - ray flares , with a peak flux of 1 crab during 1100s , every @xmath74days .",
    "these flares can be explained by accretion through clumpy winds .",
    "second , the obscured hmxbs are persistent x - ray sources composed of supergiant stellar companions exhibiting a strong intrinsic absorption and long @xmath5 .",
    "the ns is deeply embedded in the dense stellar wind , forming a dust cocoon enshrouding the whole binary system .",
    "these results show the existence in our galaxy of a dominant population of a previously rare class of high - energy binary systems : supergiant hmxbs , some exhibiting a high intrinsic absorption ( @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) . studying this population",
    "will provide a better understanding of the formation and evolution of short - living hmxbs .",
    "furthermore , stellar population models now have to take these objects into account , to assess a realistic number of high - energy binary systems in our galaxy ."
