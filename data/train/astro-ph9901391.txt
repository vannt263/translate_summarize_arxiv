    "the deuterium abundance is one of the most sensitive probes of the baryon density in the early universe ( wilson & rood 1994 ) , since it is thought that all the deuterium was produced in the big bang , with no subsequent production via nuclear reactions in stars .",
    "conversely , it is destroyed in stellar interiors , so that current measurements provide only a lower limit on the primordial deuterium abundance .",
    "thus , an observed [ d]/[h ] ratio may also be used as a measure of galactic chemical evolution . however",
    ", previous ground and airplane based attempts to measure the [ d]/[h ] ratio in a variety of interstellar sources have met with several problems , such as the very low intrinsic strength of the 92 cm line ( heiles et al .",
    "1993 ) or chemical fractionation and line saturation effects in molecules ( penzias et al .  1977 ) .",
    "the most successful measurements so far have been through satellite ultraviolet absorption line observations of the ly@xmath18 lines of atomic and through diffuse clouds along the line  of  sight toward several stars in the solar neighborhood ( i.e. within @xmath19 90 pc ) .",
    "these give [ d]/[h]=1.6@xmath410@xmath20 with a typical uncertainty of 15% , a value so far independent of the line  of  sight ( e.g. , dring et al .",
    "1997 , piskunov et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "hydrogen deuteride , hd , has also been detected in local diffuse molecular clouds through ultraviolet absorption line observations ( e.g. , spitzer et al .",
    "1973 ) , but its abundance is low in these tenuous clouds because of rapid photodissociation of the molecule . in contrast ,",
    "virtually all of the deuterium is expected to be contained within hd in dense , warm molecular clouds .",
    "measurements of the @xmath7=00 @xmath0=1@xmath10 r(0 ) 112.072 @xmath2 m line can potentially provide a direct and accurate determination of the hd abundance , and thereby also the deuterium abundance , in such clouds .",
    "a previous attempt to observe this line was made by watson et al .",
    "( 1985 ) toward the orion kl region , but resulted only in an upper limit of @xmath21 w @xmath6 . in this paper",
    "we report the first detection of the 112 @xmath2 m hd @xmath0=1@xmath10 line outside of the solar system .",
    "the detection was made toward the orion bar , a warm photon dominated region ( pdr ) , and the line is observed to be in emission .",
    "pdrs have the advantage over other source types , such as embedded young stellar objects , in that they have a large amount of warm molecular gas at sufficiently high temperatures to excite the hd @xmath0=1@xmath220 112 @xmath2 m line .",
    "they do not have cold surrounding material which could absorb and cancel part of the emission .",
    "the main drawback is that hd is rapidly photodissociated at the edge of the pdr , so that its abundance does not become large until @xmath23 mag into the cloud ( e.g. , jansen et al .",
    "the physical and chemical structure of the orion bar is , however , well understood from a variety of molecular line observations ( e.g. , hogerheijde et al .",
    "1995 , jansen et al.1995b , van der werf et al .",
    "it has a particularly high total h@xmath9 column density due to its edge  on geometry , facilitating the detection of hd .",
    "our successful observation provides a determination of the hd abundance , as well as a probe of the chemistry of molecular clouds .",
    "when compared with observations of molecular hydrogen , it also allows a constraint to be placed on the cosmologically important [ d]/[h ] ratio , the first such direct measurement in a dense molecular cloud without the complicating effects of chemical fractionation .",
    "the orion bar was observed during revolution 823 using the lws04 fabry  prot ( fp ) mode of the long wavelength spectrometer ( lws , clegg et al .",

    "the rest frequency of the hd @xmath0=1@xmath10 line is 2,674,986.66@xmath30.15 mhz ( evenson et al . 1988 ) corresponding to a vacuum wavelength of 112.072506@xmath30.000007 @xmath2 m .",
    "the observed coordinates were ra = 05@xmath24 35@xmath25 20.3@xmath26 and dec = @xmath2705@xmath28 25@xmath29 20@xmath30 ( j2000 ) , a position which closely corresponds to the peak column density of molecular gas ( e.g. , burton et al .",

    "1995 ) .",
    "the observations consist of 120 separate lws fp scans centered on the frequency of the hd @xmath0=1@xmath10 line , with 7 spectral elements on either side of the line .",
    "the data were taken with the lw2 detector in fast scanning mode , with 4 spectral samples per resolution element and 45.5 s per sample .",
    "the total on  target  time was 3913 s. the fwhm beam size at 122 @xmath2 m , the central wavelength of detector lw2 , in the spacecraft y  z directions is @xmath31 with a systematic uncertainty of up to 20% ( swinyard et al.1998 ) .",

    "1998 ) . a full range 43197  @xmath34 lws01 grating spectrum , consisting of 5 scans with 0.7 s integration time per step and a spectral sampling interval of 2 , was obtained during the same revolution for calibration purposes ( fringes , continuum level ) .",
    "initial data reduction was carried out using the iso  lws off line processing ( olp ) software , version 7.0 , up to the auto analysis result stage .",
    "further data processing , such as removal of bad data points , flat  fielding , sigma clipping and co  adding , was performed using software in the iso spectral analysis package , and the lws and short wavelength spectrometer ( sws ) interactive analysis ( ia ) packages .",
    "of particular note is the dark current subtraction and grating position correction .",
    "the relatively high flux of the bar results in some straylight leakage through the misaligned fabry ",
    "prot plates during the dark current measurements , meaning that they are not true dark currents .",
    "therefore , the dark current was iteratively modified such that the resultant continuum flux was equal to that obtained in the lws01 observation . using the lws ia tool fp_proc ( swinyard et al .",
    "1998 , sidher et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , the subsequent product was corrected for a grating positioning problem , which introduces a spurious slope in the spectrum . by adopting these procedures ,",
    "our photometric accuracy is estimated to be 30% or better ( burgdorf et al .",
    "1997 , swinyard et al .",
    "figure 1 displays the resulting spectrum after co  addition of all fp scans .",
    "an emission line is clearly visible at @xmath35 + 13 km s@xmath33 , close to the expected @xmath35 + 10 km s@xmath33 known for the bar ( e.g. , hogerheijde et al .",
    "the feature is unresolved , with an observed fwhm of @xmath19 30 km s@xmath33 ,",
    "i.e. , near the resolving power of the lws and implying an intrinsic fwhm less than this , again consistent with previous millimeter observations which show @xmath36 km s@xmath33 .",
    "the observed integrated line flux is ( 7.3@xmath31.3)@xmath410@xmath37 w @xmath6 , obtained by fitting a gaussian to the line profile , and a first order polynomial plus sinusoid due to fringing ( see below ) to the baseline .",
    "the uncertainty is statistical and represents the range of values obtained using different fitting procedures . when divided by the lw2 beam size , @xmath38 sr , the inferred surface brightness is @xmath39 erg s@xmath33 @xmath6 sr@xmath33 . as noted in the lws data users manual ( trams et al .",
    "1998 ) , the lws olp software corrects the data of detector lw2 by a factor of 0.68 for the effective aperture of the instrument , assuming that the source is point  like and located at the aperture centre .",
    "this is not the case for the orion bar , which is extended in both its gas and dust emission .",
    "the data users manual gives a correction factor of 0.87/0.68 at 100120 @xmath2 m which must be applied to observed fluxes for extended sources .",
    "the resulting best estimate of the flux is @xmath40 w @xmath6 and of the surface brightness is @xmath41 erg s@xmath33 @xmath6 sr@xmath33 .",
    "this corresponds to an antenna temperature of @xmath190.22  k in the lws beam for @xmath422 km s@xmath33 .",
    "the beam averaged column density in the hd @xmath7=0 , @xmath0=1 state is obtained from @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the observed surface brightness .",
    "using @xmath45 s@xmath33 ( abgrall , roueff & viala 1982 ) , @xmath46=(1.20@xmath30.21)@xmath410@xmath8 @xmath6 is found .",
    "the small @xmath47value assures that the optically thin relation is valid .    although we are confident that the observed feature is real and corresponds to the 112 @xmath2 m @xmath0=1@xmath10 line of hd , there are a few noteworthy points to be made .",
    "first , it is well known that the lws grating spectral responsivity calibration file at 112 @xmath2 m has a spurious `` absorption '' feature resulting from hd absorption in the calibration source uranus . however , this does not affect the fp spectrum , where the resolving power is a factor of @xmath19 50 greater than the grating . across the width of our fp spectrum",
    "the calibration file is virtually flat .",
    "second , a similarly sensitive hd 112 @xmath2 m observation was made toward the galactic center , where no corresponding emission feature is seen ( wright et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "another possible source of spurious emission is from leakage into the fp of adjacent spectral orders .",
    "the fp free spectral range at 112 @xmath2 m is 1.12 @xmath2 m , and the lws observer s manual ( clegg , heske & trams 1994 ) discusses possible contamination .",
    "the grating acts as an order sorter for the fp , and its resolving power was specifically set such that contamination is avoided . in any case , at submillimeter wavelengths the orion bar is very poor in lines compared with spectroscopically rich sources such as orion  kl ( hogerheijde et al .",
    "1995 ) , and there are no other line - rich sources in the lws beam .",
    "the only strong lines expected in the lws wavelength range are the high@xmath0 transitions from @xmath48co and @xmath49co .",
    "there is no such transition , nor any other common low  lying ( i.e. @xmath50 300 k ) molecular feature , known to be coincident with hd @xmath0=1@xmath10 within 0.01 @xmath2 m , or to be a possible contaminant from adjacent spectral orders .    the lws ",
    "fp data are also affected by fringing , in a similar way to lws grating data of extended sources .",
    "however , the single high frequency fringing component apparent in the data has an essentially constant period of about 0.0095 cm@xmath33 ( sidher et al . in preparation ) , which makes it easier to correct .",
    "the effect appears to occur as a result of interference within the instrument .",
    "in the following , we will discuss the derivation of the column densities of hd and h@xmath12 and compare the hd and deuterium abundances in the orion bar with those found in other regions .",
    "because of the limited sensitivity of the lws detector sw2 , observations of the 56.23 @xmath2 m 00 @xmath0=2@xmath11 r(1 ) line of hd were not feasible , so that no direct information on the excitation of the molecule is available .",
    "however , the hd excitation can be readily computed assuming lte : @xmath52 \\exp ( { e_{0,1}}/{kt})$ ] , where @xmath53 is the statistical weight of the @xmath7=0 , @xmath0=1 level , and @xmath54 is the partition function .",

    "the corresponding total hd column densities range from ( 2.6@xmath30.5)@xmath55 @xmath6 at 115200  k to ( 3.1@xmath30.6)@xmath55 @xmath6 at 85 and 300  k. including the temperature range as an additional uncertainty , our best estimate of the total hd column density is ( 2.9@xmath30.8)@xmath410@xmath8 @xmath6 .",

    "the departures from lte are small for these conditions .      to derive the hd abundance with respect to h@xmath9 , the total h@xmath9 column density , @xmath61 ,",
    "is needed in addition to @xmath62(hd ) .",
    "the most direct method is to use observations of the pure rotational lines of h@xmath12 itself .",

    "the averaged line fluxes for positions 15 ( covering @xmath66 ) give a mean excitation temperature @xmath67 between levels @xmath0=3 and 4 of 482  k and a column density of 9.9@xmath410@xmath68 @xmath6 . however , this is unlikely to represent the total h@xmath9 column density , since there is a strong temperature gradient throughout the pdr with a significant amount of cooler gas present , as indeed is shown in other molecular tracers .",
    "several methods may be used to determine the total amount of gas .",
    "first , the clumpy pdr models of burton , hollenbach & tielens ( 1990 , 1992 ) can be used to estimate the expected @xmath67 between levels @xmath0=2 and 3 . for the conditions appropriate to the interclump medium of the orion bar , where burton et al .",
    "( 1992 ) state that the bulk of the h@xmath9 emission originates , @xmath69=180260  k. using the observed column density in the @xmath0=3 level , we can then extrapolate to the @xmath0=2 level to determine its column density and thereby the total warm h@xmath9 column density , assuming that the ortho  para ratio is in lte ( sternberg & neufeld 1999 ) .",

    "this value refers to hd with respect to the total amount of warm and cold h@xmath12 .",
    "however , because the hd @xmath0=1 level lies at 128  k above ground it is only excited efficiently in gas with temperatures above @xmath77  k. in addition , hd is photodissociated at the edge of the pdr , so that the region over which h@xmath9 and hd are coexistent is less .",
    "these effects can be taken into account by comparison with detailed physical and chemical models of the orion bar , such as developed by jansen et al .",

    "warm layers are enhanced significantly , and it is estimated that at least 50% of the total column density contains hd at sufficiently high temperatures .",
