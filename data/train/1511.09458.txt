    "the nature of the ground state of a two - dimensional electron system ( 2des ) in a large perpendicular magnetic field @xmath3 has attracted a great interest . at small filling factors , @xmath4 , where @xmath0 is the 2des density and @xmath5 is the electronic charge , the ground state in the absence of disorder",
    "is expected to be the wigner crystal ( wc ) .",
    "@xcite another known ground states is the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) one .",
    "@xcite both states are induced by electron - electron interaction .",
    "it turns out that the laughlin fqhe liquid states at @xmath6 ( where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are integers ) are particularly robust and have ground state energies which are lower than the wc state energy , at least for @xmath9 .",
    "@xcite theoretical calculations predict that , in an ideal 2des , the wc should be the ground state for @xmath10 .",
    "however , the wc state may win as the filling deviates slightly from 1/5 .",
    "it is possible therefore to have a wc which is reentrant around a fqhe liquid state , see fig .",
    "9 in ref .  .",
    "this would rationalize the general current belief that the insulating phase observed around the @xmath11 in very high quality @xmath0-gaas / algaas structures is the signature of the wc state pinned by a disorder potential .",
    "this conclusion has been confirmed using various experimental methods .",
    "the magnetic - field - induced wc problem in 2dess has been studied extensively since the late 1980 s .",

    "the radio - frequency electric field can be excited using the coplanar - wave - guide technique ;  @xcite this method was successfully employed for studies of the fqhe in ref .   and other works .",
    "another probeless method of studying ac conductance uses a traveling electric field created by a surface acoustic wave ( saw ) . in connection with the integer qhe structures",
    "it was implemented in refs .   and subsequent works ;",
    "the fqhe was studied using this method in refs .  .",
    "ac methods are complementary to the dc ones . in particular , specific resonances in the ac response",
    "allow one to identify the nature of insulating states observed at specific values of the filling factor .",
    "interestingly , the magnetic field dependences of @xmath13 and @xmath14 in high - mobility structures show sharp peaks ( called  wings \" in ref .  ) around integer values of the filling factor .",
    "@xcite these sharp wings have not ever been observed in low - mobility systems .",
    "numerous microwave studies of real part , @xmath15 , of the complex conductance , @xmath16 , close to integer @xmath17 revealed resonances at frequencies of 0.4 - 3  ghz , which were ascribed to pinned modes of the wigner crystal .",
    "@xcite    the aim of the present paper is a detailed investigation of low - temperature complex conductivity of high - mobility 2des in the vicinities of integer filling factors .",
    "we use an acoustic , namely saw , technique to address properties of high - mobility @xmath0-gaas / algaas wide quantum well at low temperatures close to integer values of the filling factor @xmath18 and 2 .",
    "our main task is study of the crossover from the electronic state at an integer @xmath17 to a pinned mode of the wc at some deviation from an integer @xmath17 .",
    "we will focus on @xmath17 close to 1 , but similar behavior is also observed close to @xmath19 .    we will show that in high - mobility structures at low temperatures and exactly at filling factors @xmath20 the ac response behaves as that for localized electronic states , whereas at small deviations from the integer values its behavior crosses over : first to that of the wigner crystal and then to that of the fqhe states . this conclusion is based on experimental studies of absorption and velocity of surface acoustic waves .",
    "we use the so - called hybrid method for determining complex @xmath21 from experimentally measured attenuation and velocity of a saw excited by interdigital transducers and propagating along a surface of a piezoelectric crystal ( linbo@xmath22 ) in a perpendicular magnetic field . a sample containing a 2des is mounted at the surface of the piezoelectric crystal and",
    "is pressed to this surface by springs .",
    "the traveling wave of electric field generated by the saw penetrates the 2des causing a magnetic - field - dependent attenuation of the saw and change of its velocity .",

    "the frequency dependence of @xmath43 in the above temperature domain is weak : as the frequency changes by factor 11 , @xmath43 changes only by 20% .",
    "the values of @xmath43 at different minima corresponding to integer @xmath17 decrease with magnetic field @xmath49 as it follows from the analysis for @xmath50 , and 10",
    ". this dependence is compatible with theoretical prediction @xmath51 based on the two - site model for absorption by localized states .",
    "@xcite    now let us recall that in low ( medium ) mobility systems showing only an integer quantum hall effect behavior of @xmath43 is well described by the one - electron picture involving electrons trapped by a random potential . according to this picture , at integer @xmath17",
    "the fermi level is located in the middle of the distance between the landau levels , the electron states are localized by disorder , and low - temperature dc conductance , @xmath52 , is exponentially small .",
    "the ac conductance is determined by electron hops between nearest potential minima resulting in @xmath53 . in this case , the ac response can be explained by the two - site model , for a review see refs .   and references therein . according to this model , a pair of the electron energy minima is described as a two - level tunneling system ( tls ) with diagonal splitting @xmath54 and tunneling splitting @xmath55 , the interlevel spacing being @xmath56 . at sufficiently low frequencies",
    "the ac response is due to relaxation of the nonequilibrium populations of the minima .",
    "the corresponding relaxation rate can be expressed as , cf .",
    ", @xmath57 here @xmath58 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "equation assumes that the levels populations relax due to interaction between localized electrons and phonons .",
    "the interaction matrix element contains , therefore , the electron - phonon coupling constant as well as the tunneling coupling between the sites , @xmath55 , which exponentially decays with the distance @xmath59 between the minima .",
    "the corresponding relaxation rate , @xmath60 , is , therefore , proportional to @xmath61 that is taken into account by the last factor in eq .  .",
    "in addition to the coupling constant squared , the rate is proportional to the phonon density of states at frequency @xmath62 .",
    "however , only the configurations with @xmath63 are important since the configurations with @xmath64 are frozen in their ground states .",
    "therefore , we split the rate into the factor @xmath65 ( corresponding to the systems with @xmath66 ) and dimensionless function , @xmath67 , which depends on the details of the electron - phonon interaction .",
    "@xcite it is normalized in order to have @xmath68 . since @xmath69 , the time @xmath70 has a meaning of the _ minimal _ relaxation time for a tls with the level splitting @xmath66 .",
    "the theory predicts that ( with logarithmic accuracy )  @xcite @xmath71 the first of the above expressions allows a simple qualitative interpretation .",
    "let us consider tlss with @xmath72 , which plays the main role .",
    "the contribution of a tls to the dissipation depends on the product @xmath73 .",
    "very  fast \" systems with @xmath74 do not essentially contribute because their populations almost adiabatically follow the ac electric field . on the other hand ,",

    "notice that the characteristic temperature of this crossover in the temperature dependence of conductivity decreases with increasing deviation of the filing factor from the unity , @xmath100 .",
    "we assume that the observed initial increase of @xmath43 with rising temperature at all values @xmath101 1.1 is associated with the hopping nature of this conductivity at low temperatures . assuming that the conductance of the localized phase can be represented by the single - electron expression ( [ rel2 ] ) at @xmath102 we expect that @xmath103 is an increasing function of temperature , with the slope proportional to the squared single - electron density of states , @xmath104 .",

    "<S> our result is that in very close vicinities of integer filling factors the ac response of a high - mobility two - dimensional structures behaves as that of a two - dimensional system of localized electrons . </S>",
    "<S> namely , both real and imaginary parts of the complex ac conductance at low temperatures agree with the predictions for the two - site model for a two - dimensional hopping system . another result is the specific temperature dependences of @xmath1 , which are extremely sensitive to the filling factor value . </S>",
    "<S> these dependences indicate a sharp crossover between the localized modes and a pinned wigner crystal . </S>"
