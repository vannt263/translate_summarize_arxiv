    "bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) in optical lattices ( ol ) have recently attracted a great deal of attention due to the possibility of investigating , both at the theoretical and at the experimental level , interesting physical phenomena such as bloch oscillations , landau zener tunneling , mott transitions , etc . @xcite .",
    "the interplay between the nonlinearity ( intrinsic in the interatomic interaction ) and the periodic structure ( induced by the ol ) leads to the formation of localized states trough the mechanism of the modulational instability of the bloch states at the edges of the brillouin zone of the underlying linear periodic system @xcite .",
    "these states , also known as gap - solitons , can exist in presence of both attractive and repulsive interactions @xcite , this last fact being possible only due to the presence of the ol .    the existence of gap solitons in repulsive bec was experimentally demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "the phenomena of bloch oscillations , generation of coherent atomic pulses ( atom laser)@xcite , superfluid - mott transition@xcite , were also experimentally observed .",
    "the ols considered in these experiments act as external potentials ( and therefore linearly ) on the condensate , this introducing an intrinsic ( state independent ) periodicity in the system . in the following",
    "we shall refer to this type of lattices as _ linear _ ols ( lols ) . in higher dimensions lols",
    "were shown to be very effective in stabilizing localized states against collapse or decay , leading to the formation of stable multidimensional solitons @xcite .",
    "besides lols , it is also possible to consider _ nonlinear _ ols ( nols ) with symmetry properties which depend on the wavefunction characterizing the state of the system .",
    "a nol can be obtained by inducing a periodic spatial variation of the two body interatomic interaction strength ( atomic scattering length ) , leading to a periodic space modulation of the nonlinear coefficient in the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) governing the mean field dynamics of the ground state .",
    "this periodic modulation can be experimentally achieved either by means of the standard feshbach resonance method @xcite , taking an external magnetic field near the resonance which is spatially periodic @xcite , or by the optically induced feshbach resonance technique . in the last case",
    "the nonlinear periodic potential can be produced by two counter propagating laser beams with parameters near the optically induced feshbach resonance @xcite .",
    "a periodic variation of the laser field intensity in space and a proper choice of the resonance detuning lead to a spatial dependence of the scattering length @xcite and hence to a spatial dependent nonlinear coefficient in the gpe .",
    "different interesting phenomena occurring in bec in presence of a nol have already been studied , such as the transmission of wave packets through nonlinear barriers , generation of atomic solitons , and existence of localized states refs .",
    "mathematical properties of the ground state and the existence of localized states of quasi-1d bec in nol have also been studied in @xcite .",
    "all these studies @xcite concern mainly with scalar ( single component ) 1d bec in nol .",
    "the possibility of stabilizing multi - dimensional scalar solitons by means of nols is presently under investigation ( preliminary studies show that nols are unable to stabilize 2d solitons if the average nonlinearity is negative ) , while multi - component becs in nol have not been considered yet neither theoretically nor experimentally .",
    "this last problem arises when two or more bec atomic species interact in presence of periodic spatial modulations of the scattering lengths , which can occur between the species ( inter - species ) and/or within the species ( intra - species ) .",
    "the interaction between the two bec components leads to an inter - species nol which can play a stabilizing role for localized states .",
    "spatial modulations of the intra - species scattering length ( giving rise to intra - species nols ) can also lead to the existence of new types of soliton states .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to study the properties of the localized states of two - component bec mixtures in nols .",
    "the case of a sinusoidal variation in space of the intra- and inter - species scattering lengths will be considered . in particular",
    "we show the existence of new types of solitons and study their stability by means of analytical and numerical methods .",
    "the symmetry properties of the localized with respect to the nol are also investigated .",
    "we show that the nol allows the existence of bright soliton modes with equal symmetry in both components , bright localized modes of mixed symmetry type , as well as bright - dark bound states and bright modes on periodic backgrounds .",
    "we also show that , in spite of the quasi 1d nature of the problem , the fundamental symmetric localized modes undergo a delocalizing transition when the strength of the non linear optical lattice is varied .",
    "this transition is associated with the existence of an unstable solution which exhibit a shrinking ( decaying ) behavior for slightly overcritical ( undercritical ) variations in the number of atoms .",
    "the phenomenon of the delocalizing transition was also investigated in @xcite for the case of multidimensional single component bec solitons in lol and in @xcite for the case of one - dimensional bec s with combined linear and nonlinear ol s .",
    "delocalizing transitions in binary bec mixtures have not been previously investigated .    for the analysis of strongly localized modes ( i.e. localized in one or few cells of the nol ) we will apply the variational approach which was shown to be effective for such type of problems , while for delocalizing transitions and broad solitons we use a vectorial gross - pitaevskii equation averaged over rapid variations in space of the nonlinear potential .",
    "results are then compared with those obtained by direct numerical simulations of the coupled gpe system . as numerical tools to investigate the above problems we use both self - consistent exact diagonalizations @xcite and generalized relaxing methods @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe the physical model for the two component bec under action of a nol , based on the optical manipulation of the scattering length by optically induced feshbach resonances .",
    "the model equations are introduced in the mean field approximation in terms of two coupled 1d gross - pitaevskii equations with intra- and inter - species interaction terms .",
    "the problem of existence of soliton solutions ( when the inter- and intra - species atomic scattering lengths are periodically modulated in space ) , the symmetry properties of localized modes and their stability are discussed in sections iii .",
    "the delocalizing transitions of fundamental modes and the existence of unstable solutions associated with them are studied in section iv .",
    "the analytical predictions are confirmed by direct numerical simulations of the full gp equation ( sections ii - iv ) .",
    "finally , in section v , the main results of the paper are summarized .",
    "two component condensate represent the mixture of atoms in the different hyperfine states@xcite .",
    "we consider here the dynamics of two - component bec in presence of a nonlinear optical lattice produced either by spatially varying magnetic fields near a feshbach resonance ( fr ) value or by optically induced feshbach resonances @xcite . according to this last approach , the scattering length @xmath0 can be optically manipulated if the incident light is close to the resonance with one of the bound @xmath1 levels of electronically excited molecules .",
    "virtual radiative transitions of a pair of interacting atoms to this level , can change value and/or reverse the sign of the scattering length .",
