    "in continuum non abelian field theories , most popular choices of fixing the gauge ( e.g. landau , coulomb ) suffer from the gribov ambiguity @xcite .",
    "it is now well established that this problem also affects the lattice formulation of these theories @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this problem has been neglected for a long time because , in principle , the computation of gauge invariant operators in compact lattice theories does not require gauge fixing . fixing the gauge is , however , necessary in several cases .",
    "monopole studies in su(2 ) pure gauge theory have been done in the unitary gauge and the effect of the gribov ambiguity on the number of su(2 ) monopoles has been investigated @xcite .",
    "the authors conclude that , in their case , the gribov noise does not exceed the statistical uncertainty . in su(3 )",
    "gauge theory , gauge fixing is essential in the the computation of gauge dependent quantities , such as gluon and quark propagators .",
    "there are now several studies of lattice propagators .",
    "the gluon propagator has been calculated in @xcite-@xcite with the aim of studying the mechanism through which the gluon may become massive at long distances .",
    "more recent attempts have investigated its behaviour as a function of momentum @xcite .",
    "analogous studies have also been performed on the quark propagator ( see , for example @xcite ) . in practice , there are also cases in which it is convenient to implement a gauge dependent procedure for the computation of gauge invariant quantities @xcite-@xcite . for example , smeared fermionic interpolating operators are widely being used in lattice qcd spectroscopy and phenomenology , in order to optimise the overlap of the lower - lying physical state with the operator .",
    "the point - splitted smeared operators are gauge dependent , and therefore the gauge must be fixed before they are calculated . in particular , the calculation of the decay constant of the @xmath5 meson in the static approximation , in which the @xmath6-quark has infinite mass , requires the computation of the two point correlation function of the axial current .",
    "the isolation of the lightest state at large times is not possible if local ( gauge invariant ) operators are used . a nice way out consists in smearing the bilocal operator over a small cube and extracting @xmath7 by forming suitable ratios of smeared and local correlation functions @xcite .",
    "this is an explicitly gauge dependent procedure which is most naturally carried out in the coulomb gauge . in ref.@xcite the smeared - smeared correlation functions on a few individual configurations were computed .",
    "two gribov copies were produced per configuration .",
    "the gribov noise on individual configurations was found to vary from @xmath8 to @xmath9 depending on the time - slice , which implies that it may still be a considerable effect after averaging over configurations .",
    "however , it was not possible to estimate its effect beyond individual configurations .",
    "the reason is that in such a study other sources of error dominate , such as the systematic error arising from fitting the exponential decay of the correlation function with time .",
    "thus the isolation of the gribov noise is difficult . in the static limit @xcite",
    "uses a different method for constructing ratios of smeared and local correlators which avoids fitting .",
    "this method , however , requires a large temporal extention of the lattice . ]    in this paper we study a different physical quantity , namely the renormalisation constant @xmath0 of the lattice axial current .",
    "a knowledge of these renormalisation constants is necessary for matching the matrix elements computed using lattice simulations to those required in a definite continuum renormalisation scheme .",
    "provided that the lattice spacing is sufficiently small it is possible to calculate these renormalisation constants in perturbation theory . for a more reliable determination of these constants",
    "it has been suggested to impose the chiral ward identities of @xmath10 non - perturbatively @xcite .",
    "here we focus our attention on the determination of the r@xmath11le of the gribov ambiguity in the calculation of @xmath0 , obtained from quark state correlation functions . a recently proposed method to determine @xmath0 and other renormalisation constants , based on truncated quark green functions in momentum space @xcite",
    "can also in principle be afflicted by gribov fluctuations .",
    "since reasonably small errors are expected , in this kind of calculations , it is crucial to investigate the r@xmath12le of the gribov noise .",
    "moreover , the renormalisation constant @xmath0 of the axial current is particularly well suited to the study of the gribov fluctuations , mainly for two reasons .",
    "firstly , @xmath0 can be obtained from chiral ward identities in two distinct ways : a gauge independent one , which consists in taking the matrix elements between hadronic states , and a gauge dependent one , which consists in taking the matrix elements between quark states .",
    "hence , there is an explicitly gauge invariant estimate of @xmath0 which is free of gribov noise and which can be directly compared to the gauge dependent , gribov affected , estimate .",
    "the second advantage is that @xmath0 is obtained by solving a first degree algebraic equation for each lattice time slice , thus avoiding the usual systematic errors arising from fitting exponentially decaying signals in time .",
    "the theoretical framework for the non - perturbative evaluation of @xmath0 for wilson fermions , has been developed in @xcite .",
    "the renormalisation constant is obtained through ward identities generated by axial transformations .",
    "a first application of these techniques in numerical simulations using the wilson action was attempted in @xcite .",
    "the extension of these methods to the @xmath13 improved clover action @xcite ( @xmath14 is the lattice spacing ) was presented in @xcite , which we follow most closely .",
    "here we only give a brief outline of the results which are essential to our work .    in this study terms",
    "that , close to the continuum limit , are effectively of @xmath13 are eliminated by using the clover action @xcite and rotating all quark fields of the matrix elements according to the `` improved improvement '' prescription of @xcite : @xmath15 ( @xmath16 is the wilson term parameter ; in this work @xmath17 ) .",
    "the two fermion local operators considered in the following are the axial and vector currents and the pseudoscalar density : @xmath18 ( @xmath19 is a flavour label and the notation is generic for any quark fields @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) . in order to ensure that the lattice axial current @xmath22 has the correct chiral properties , it is normalised by a renormalisation constant @xmath0 @xcite ; this implies that @xmath23 ( m is the bare quark mass and @xmath24 the pseudoscalar state ) . as can be seen from the above equation , @xmath25 is gauge invariant .    the gauge dependent calculation of @xmath0 relies on the following ward identity for quark green functions @xcite @xmath26 \\nonumber \\\\ = \\left ( \\frac{1}{z_{a}}-{\\rho ra}\\right ) tr \\left [ \\int d^3\\vec y < ( \\gamma_5 d(y)\\bar d(0)\\ , + \\ , u(y)\\bar u ( 0)\\gamma _ 5 ) > _ { \\alpha,\\beta } \\right ] \\label{eq : wiqp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in eq.([eq : wiqp ] ) we work explicitly with up and down quark fields with spinor labels @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the trace is over colour indices .",
    "the expectation values on both sides of ( [ eq : wiqp ] ) are evaluated as functions of @xmath29 .",
    "taking the value of @xmath30 obtained using eq.([eq : twomzal ] ) , @xmath31 can then be determined . in order to enhance the signal , we add in both sides of ( [ eq : wiqp ] ) the four contributions @xmath32=(1,3 ) , ( 3,1 ) , ( 2,4 ) and ( 4,2 ) , which were found to give the clearest signal @xcite .",
    "a plateau in @xmath29 is typically obtained and @xmath0 is estimated from it .",
    "the crucial point is that both sides of eq.([eq : wiqp ] ) are gauge dependent , and thus this determination of @xmath0 is in principle sensitive to the gribov noise .",
    "a gauge invariant determination of @xmath0 is obtained through the ward identity @xmath33 in the above equation , the vector current renormalisation constant @xmath34 is also needed .",
    "for the clover action , @xmath34 is calculated with the aid of the so - called conserved and improved vector current @xmath35 \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ + ( x\\rightarrow x-\\hat\\mu ) + \\frac{r}{2 } \\sum_{\\rho}\\partial_\\rho\\left(\\bar\\psi(x)\\sigma _ { \\rho\\mu}\\psi(x)\\right ) \\label{eq : vci}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the current is conserved , its renormalisation constant is precisely 1 , and , since it is  improved \" , its matrix elements have no corrections of @xmath13 .",
    "the normalisation constant @xmath34 of the local vector current @xmath36 is determined through the ratio of the vacuum to vector state matrix elements of the two vector currents @xcite : @xmath37 ( here @xmath38 denotes the vector state ) . by calculating all correlation functions of eq.([eq : wivaint ] ) and",
    "@xmath34 from eq.([eq : zvrat ] ) and by requiring that eq.([eq : wivaint ] ) holds at each @xmath29 , we can determine @xmath0 in an explicitly gauge invariant fashion for which the gribov ambiguity is irrelevant .",
    "one more comment is in place here : the terms proportional to @xmath39 on the right - hand - side of eqs.([eq : wiqp ] ) and ( [ eq : wivaint ] ) arise from the rotations of the fermion fields defined in eq.([rot ] ) , which are inherent to clover action improvement @xcite .",
    "the @xmath40 rotations , combined with the equations of motion , generate contact terms which , to @xmath13 , give rise to the terms proportional to @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "gauge fixing and the generation of gribov copies on the lattice is by now a standard procedure .",
    "given a thermalised configuration generated by a monte carlo simulation , the landau gauge is fixed by minimising the functional @xcite @xmath41 \\equiv - \\frac{1}{v } re \\ tr   \\sum_{\\mu=1}^{4 } \\sum_{n } u_{\\mu}^{g}(n ) \\label{eq : bigf}\\ ] ] with respect to @xmath42 . here",
    "@xmath43 is the lattice volume and @xmath44 is the compact @xmath1 gauge field , gauge transformed by a local gauge transformation @xmath45 .",
    "the extrema of @xmath46 correspond to configurations that satisfy the gauge condition @xmath47 in discretised form .",
    "the minimisation of @xmath46 is obtained through iteration : each lattice site is visited and @xmath46 is minimized locally .",
    "after several lattice sweeps @xmath46 becomes constant , and the gauge is fixed .",
    "this is nothing else but a discretised analogue of the continuum formulation @xcite , according to which the local minima of the functional @xmath48 = - \\sum_{\\mu=1}^4 tr \\int d^4x ( a^g_\\mu)^2 $ ] with respect to @xmath49 correspond to configurations in the landau gauge . even if there is a straightforward correspondence between the lattice and continuum gauge fixing procedures , it is interesting to note that on the lattice , because of discretisation , there can be more minima than in the continuum @xcite .",
    "the production of gribov copies consists in generating gauge equivalent configurations , by applying random gauge transformations to our thermalised link configuration @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the gauge is then fixed and @xmath46 is measured . since it is a gauge dependent quantity , a different value of @xmath46 for two gauge equivalent , gauge fixed configurations means that they are gribov copies .",
    "the over - relaxation technique of @xcite ( which consists in accelerating the gauge fixing algorithm by raising the gauge transformation @xmath49 to a real tunable power @xmath50 at every iteration ) has been implemented at fixed @xmath50 .",
    "the over - relaxation itself can be used for the generation of gribov copies , by varying the value of @xmath50 , as proposed in @xcite . in this work",
    "we have opted for the random gauge transformation method .",
    "we work in the framework of the quenched approximation with the clover action of su(3 ) gauge theory .",
    "the lattice volume is @xmath51 and @xmath3 .",
    "after @xmath52 thermalising sweeps , 36 configurations were generated , separated by @xmath53 sweeps .",
    "an @xmath54 hit metropolis algorithm was used . for each thermalised configuration",
    ", we generated @xmath55 gribov copies .",
    "this was done by fixing the gauge both on the original configuration and on @xmath56 gauge equivalent replicas , obtained by applying random gauge transformations .",
    "it is remarkable that , in our case , each random gauge transformation produced a gribov copy .",
    "this high probability to find gribov copies is a characteristic of large volume lattices in the confined region , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "we fix the landau gauge , using the over - relaxation algorithm suggested in @xcite at fourth order in the over - relaxation parameter @xmath57 .",
    "the stopping condition we have imposed is that the relative variation @xmath58 , of the minimised functional @xmath46 , between two consecutive gauge fixing sweeps be less than @xmath59 .",
    "this value guarantees a good quality of the gauge fixing , allows us to distinguish gribov copies , and it is typically reached after a number of sweeps which varies between 500 and 1500 .",
    "the gauge fixing was done on an ibm risc 6000/550 equipped with 128 mbyte of ram memory and with a cpu working at 42 mhz ; with this machine a single gauge fixing sweep takes about 40 s. the quark propagators , rotated as indicated by eq.([rot ] ) were obtained at a wilson hopping parameter value of @xmath60 , which , for the clover action , corresponds to a pion of roughly 900 mev .    before passing to a detailed discussion of the gribov noise ,",
    "it is appropriate to present a comparison of the results for @xmath0 , obtained in a gauge invariant way ( see eq.([eq : wivaint ] ) ) , to those based on the gauge dependent identity of eq.([eq : wiqp ] ) .",
    "this calculation has been already presented in @xcite , on the first 18 configurations of our ensemble ; here we have doubled the statistics .",
    "moreover , we have re - gauged the first 18 configurations in order to reach the better quality of gauge fixing required for this study . in fig.(1 ) we show the behaviour of the two estimates of @xmath0 , as a function of @xmath29 , calculated on the same ensemble of 36 configurations .",
    "the gauge invariant values of @xmath0 show a flat behaviour already at @xmath61 and with small error bars .",
    "the new value of @xmath0 , obtained with the gauge independent technique , over 36 configurations , is @xmath62 to be compared with the old one obtained over 18 configurations : @xmath63 ( see ref.@xcite ) .    in the gauge dependent case",
    ", we have taken the average over the gribov copies , in the way that will be discussed below . in this case , the @xmath0 behaviour becomes flat only at @xmath64 showing a large sensitivity to the contact terms of the ward identity at small @xmath29 values .",
    "the new value of @xmath0 , obtained from the gauge dependent ward identity , as can be seen from fig.(1 ) is @xmath65 ; to be compared to the value obtained from 18 configurations , @xmath66 ( see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "as already stressed in @xcite , this method gives results that are compatible within the errors with the gauge independent ones .",
    "moreover , the error of the gauge invariant calculation of @xmath0 is always smaller than the error of its gauge dependent counterpart .",
    "this is due to the fact that the quark state correlation functions fluctuate more than the gauge invariant correlation functions , but it may also indicate the presence of another effect , which is probably the gribov ambiguity . in the hypothetical case of two determinations of @xmath0 , affected by the same statistical error , the gauge dependent estimate should fluctuate more due to the gribov noise .",
    "then the amount of gribov noise could be estimated as the difference ( in quadrature ) of the two errors .    normally , in a standard simulation of gauge dependent quantities",
    ", one does not generate gribov copies .",
    "consequently , one measures a given quantity by taking the average and error over the ensemble of the gauge fixed configurations that have been generated .",
    "this implies a particular and arbitrary choice of gribov copies .",
    "the error estimated , for example , by a jacknife method , is not purely statistical as it implicitly contains the uncertainty due to the particular choice of a gribov copy .    in our case , having generated @xmath67 copies for each of the @xmath68 thermalised configurations , there are @xmath69 possible combinations that we may consider when forming a particular ensemble .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , the distribution of the gribov copies of a given configuration is unknown ; thus the weight to be associated to it is arbitrary .",
    "moreover , any technique used to generate different gribov copies selects a particular copy in a completely uncontrolled way .",
    "hence , we assume that the particular choice of different combinations of gribov copies when forming a statistical ensemble is arbitrary . in order to exhibit the effect of such arbitrariness , we show in fig.(2 ) the behaviour of @xmath70 for @xmath71 arbitrary choices of copies .",
    "the @xmath71 different behaviours are compatible , and the same is true for the jacknife errors .",
    "it is clear , however , that the presence of gribov copies is a visible effect ; each of the six estimates of @xmath0 shown has a slightly different profile as a function of @xmath29 .",
    "we now expose the procedure we implemented for taking into account the gribov ambiguity .",
    "the gauge dependent traces of the two and three point correlation functions appearing in eq.([eq : wiqp ] ) , calculated on a single configuration @xmath72 and for a particular gribov copy @xmath42 are denoted by : @xmath73 \\nonumber \\\\ t_3(t_y ; c , g ) = tr \\left [ \\int d^4x \\int d^3\\vec y \\ , u(y)\\,\\left(\\bar u(x)\\gamma_5 d(x)\\right ) \\,\\bar",
    "d(0)\\ \\right ] \\label{eq",
    ": t2t3a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( in the above equations the dirac indices have been implicitly averaged over , as explained in sect.(2 ) ) .",
    "then , for a given configuration @xmath72 , we consider our `` best estimate '' of these matrix elements to be their average over the @xmath67 gribov copies : @xmath74 the average of the above @xmath75 s over the @xmath76 configurations will be taken as our `` best estimate '' @xmath77 for the gauge dependent traces . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath25 , being gauge invariant , does not depend on a particular choice of gribov copies , but only on the configuration ensemble .",
    "then @xmath70 is obtained by applying eq.([eq : twomzal ] ) as follows @xmath78 the error is obtained by a standard jacknife method performed on the quantities @xmath79,@xmath80 and @xmath81 , by decimating one configuration at a time .",
    "this is the gauge dependent @xmath70 result shown in fig.(1 ) .",
    "we want to stress that the values of @xmath82 and @xmath83 fluctuate more than their ratio @xmath84 .",
    "the latter quantity is gauge invariant , according to eq.([eq : zam1 ] ) . for example , at @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "the strong reduction of the relative error indicates a great sensitivity of @xmath89 to the gribov fluctuation , as opposed to a relative stability of the gauge invariant quantities .    in order to estimate the uncertainty arising from a particular choice of copies , out of the @xmath90 possible ones , we have applied a procedure which takes this arbitrariness into account",
    "we have chosen randomly @xmath91 combinations of copies of our ensemble and have calculated @xmath70 for each one of these combinations at fixed @xmath29 .",
    "the histogram of the values obtained for @xmath70 is well fitted by a gaussian , the r.m.s .",
    "width of which is taken as an estimate of the fluctuation . in fig.(3",
    "a ) we compare the jacknife error of our `` best estimate '' to the width of the gaussian .",
    "we see that for all @xmath29 the width is smaller than the jacknife error .",
    "this implies that the fluctuations induced by the particular choice of gribov copy when forming the ensemble are small and do not overcome the statistical uncertainty .",
    "as it is also important to understand how the above behaviour scales with increasing the number of configurations , we have performed the same analysis for the first @xmath92 configurations ( half of our ensemble ) .",
    "the result is shown in fig.(3 b ) .",
    "comparing fig.(3 a ) to fig.(3 b ) , we note that both errors scale at least as @xmath93 . thus , within our moderate statistics , we find that the error , even if affected by the gribov ambiguity , decreases with increasing configuration number .    in conclusion , our investigation , even within its limitations , shows that , on the lattice , the residual gauge dependence associated with the gribov copies does not generate an overwhelming fluactuation of the @xmath0 measurements performed by the gauge dependent method .",
    "nevertheless the arbitrariness associated to a particular choice of gribov copies is a visible effect which manifests itself , especially in the behaviour of @xmath0 as a function of @xmath29 .",
    "the jacknife error is greater in the gauge dependent determination than in the gauge independent one .",
    "however , in the former case , even though the error is afflicted by the gribov uncertainty , it is still decreasing with increasing statistics .",
    "this implies that the uncertainty arising from the gribov ambiguity may be a secondary effect .",
    "analogous studies on different physical quantities and renormalisation constants could further support this belief .",
