    "excitons in semiconductors have been the subject of many experimental and theoretical investigations of bose condensation .",
    "low - energy exciton - exciton interactions are characterized by the exciton - exciton scattering length , @xmath5 , which determines the thermodynamics of a low density gas and is crucial for modeling the thermalization time of a dilute exciton gas . despite its importance",
    ", the exciton - exciton scattering length is an elusive quantity , being difficult to measure experimentally or to estimate theoretically .",
    "as is well - known in atomic physics , scattering lengths can be extremely sensitive to the details of the interactions between particles .",
    "in particular , the existence of a weakly bound or nearly bound state causes the scatter length to become quite large .",
    "therefore , _ a priori _ one should suspect that exciton - exciton scattering may be a very material dependent property of semiconductors .",
    "reliable theoretical predictions of exciton - exciton scatting lengths require both a very accurate hamiltonian for the semiconductor , and an accurate solution to the ( four - particle ) scattering problem . in this paper",
    "we provide an essentially exact solution to exciton - exciton scattering for a commonly used single - band effective mass hamiltonian .",
    "this solution allows us to study three important questions : ( 1 ) how sensitive is the scattering length to the mass ratio @xmath6 , ( 2 ) how does the scattering length depend on spin states ( singlet or triplet ) of the scattering excitons , and ( 3 ) to what degree can inter - exciton exchange of electrons or holes cause excitons to scatter into different spin states ?",
    "this calculations also serve as a benchmark for the single band limit of more complicated scattering hamiltonians .    one experimental method for measuring the exciton scattering cross section is to look at line width broadening of the recombination spectra in a gas of excitons",
    ". collisions between excitons increase the line width , causing the line width to depend on the exciton - exciton scattering rate , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the density and @xmath9 is a typical exciton velocity .",
    "extracting cross sections from a line width requires that ( 1 ) the density and velocity distribution are known , and ( 2 ) elastic scattering is the fastest process . as discussed below , @xmath10 is a good material for comparison to the model studied in this work .",
    "et al._@xcite have performed such experiments on @xmath10 and have found a line width broadening that suggests an upper bound of @xmath11 on the scattering length .",
    "although our simulations do not exactly model @xmath10 , we will compare our results to this value .",
    "theoretical approaches to this problem start with the effective mass approximation , in which the system under consideration consists of two electrons , labeled @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and two holes , labeled @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath16 where @xmath17 . the hamiltonian has symmetry under exchange of electrons and exchange of holes , so eigenstates may be denoted by two exchange quantum numbers .",
    "the s - wave states are symmetric under exchange of excitons ; a condition which is satisfied by states @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where the @xmath20 signs refer to ( anti)symmetry under exchange of electrons and holes , respectively .",
    "although this hamiltonian is a well - accepted model for exciton - exciton scattering , we should point out a few of its deficiencies . for small excitons , such as those in @xmath10 , that have radii not much larger than the lattice spacing , non - parabolic terms in the kinetic energy and other corrections to the potential energy may be necessary . for many semiconductors , such as si and ge ,",
    "the valence band is a mixture of three bands and can not be described by a single parabolic band . in the case of @xmath10 ,",
    "the valence band is the parabolic spin - orbit split off band , and there are fewer complications .",
    "interband exchange ( virtual electron - hole recombination ) is an important effect that has been neglected , and could be modeled by an additional spin - dependent potential term .",
    "this hamiltonian also describes a family of scattering processes for other particles , including hydrogen - hydrogen , positronium - positronium , and muonium - muonium scattering .",
    "the equal mass case is at an extreme ( positronium scattering ) , where the born - oppenheimer approximation is the least applicable .",
    "there have been several theoretical estimates of exciton - exciton scattering for bulk systems@xcite and quantum wells@xcite as well as calculations on biexciton - biexciton scattering,@xcite only the bulk , elastic scattering calculations@xcite are directly comparable to the results of this paper , but the techniques presented here could be generalized to the other scattering problems .",
    "also , the results presented here provide a benchmark for evaluating the approximations used in other theoretical treatments , and could lend insight into the reliability of the approximations in more complicated situations .",
    "one standard theoretical approach is diagrammatic perturbation theory , as presented in the work of keldysh and kolsov@xcite and haug and hanamura.@xcite they estimate the exciton - exciton scattering matrix as arising from a single term , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 represents a state of two noninteracting excitons with momentum @xmath23 and @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the inter - exciton coulomb interaction .",
    "this method gives an estimate of @xmath26 ( independent of the mass ratio ) , where @xmath27 is the exciton radius , but it is an uncontrolled approximation which may have limited validity in the low energy limit",
    ". one serious drawback of the method is that it does not include effects of the biexciton in the scattering .",
    "as we show later , biexciton vibrational states cause strong dependence of the scattering length on the mass ratio @xmath6 , which is not captured by the low order perturbation theory .",
    "a second common approach was developed by elkomoss and munchy,@xcite and uses an effective exciton - exciton potential defined by @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the wavefunction for two free excitons a distance @xmath30 apart .",
    "the effective potential @xmath31 arises from the hartree term and is used in a two - particle central - field calculation .",
    "while an exciton - exciton scattering pseudo - potential would be a very useful tool , this approximate form has some serious drawbacks . among its deficiencies",
    "are a lack of correlation , no van der waals attraction , a failure to reproduce biexciton states , and a vanishing interaction potential for @xmath32 .",
    "the cross sections calculated by this method are small and lack qualitative agreement with the results of the present work .",
    "some insight into exciton - exciton scattering can be gained by considering the bound states , biexcitons . since the number of bound states , @xmath33 , enters in the phase shift at zero energy , @xmath34 , it is necessary that a good computation method for low energy scattering be able accurately calculate biexciton binding energies.@xcite for the mass ratios considered ( and far beyond , including deuterium ) the biexcitons can not bind in the @xmath19 states , so biexcitons in rotational @xmath35 states always have @xmath18 wavefunctions .",
    "detailed theoretical descriptions of biexcitons can be found in ref .",
    "the equal mass case was shown to have a bound biexciton by hyllerass and ore using a variational argument,@xcite and a better variational estimate of the binding energy was given by brinkman , rice and bell,@xcite who found @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the exciton binding energy . however , because of the importance of correlation energy , the latter variational treatment was missing _",
    "half _ of the biexciton binding energy , as shown by diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) calculations,@xcite which find @xmath38 .",
    "dmc is a quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) method that uses a random walk to project out the ground state wavefunction from a variational wavefunction , in order to stochastically sample the exact ground state energy .",
    "the success of dmc for calculating biexciton energies has been a motivation for its use in the present scattering calculations .",
    "the @xmath30-matrix approach to scattering is to examine the standing waves of the system .",
    "as shown by carlson , pandharipande , and wiringa@xcite and alhassid and koonin,@xcite by fixing nodes in the standing waves the scattering problem may be cast as a stationary state problem suitable for qmc methods . for an elastic scattering process",
    ", we label the distance between the products by @xmath30 , and the reduced mass of the products by @xmath39 . in exciton - exciton scattering",
    "there is a subtlety in the definition of r due to inter - exciton exchange , which we will address below in our discussion of the exciton - exciton scattering wavefunctions . nonetheless , for large separation @xmath30",

    "each choice of @xmath44 gives a spectrum of states @xmath46 , with energies @xmath47 that determine values of @xmath43 , @xmath48 where @xmath49 .",
    "the scattering matrix elements are determined by the phase shifts , @xmath50 - 1.\\ ] ]    carlson has also proposed fixing the logarithmic derivative of the wavefunction at the boundary instead of setting wavefunction to zero , @xcite @xmath51 were @xmath52 is the normal to the boundary surface , at a fixed radius @xmath53 , and @xmath54 parameterizes the boundary condition .",
    "this formulation has the advantage of separating the choice of simulation size @xmath53 ( subject to @xmath53 lying in the asymptotic region ) , from the sampling of energy , which is handled by varying @xmath54 , and is particularly well suited for finding the scattering length .",
    "the application to vmc calculations is straight - forward , but preserving the boundary condition in dmc calculations requires a method of images .",
    "@xcite the results presented here do not use the logarithmic - derivative boundary condition .",
    "the use of excited states @xmath55 is necessary when there is a bound state and , more generally , when the scattering state being studied has its first node before the asymptotic region is reached .",

    "this computational approach should be extended in many ways .",
    "the extension to higher angular momentum states would give important corrections at higher scattering energies .",
    "application to biexciton - biexciton scattering are possible , but would be a bit more difficult because the scattering wavefunction would then have to describe eight interacting particles .",
    "most importantly , the method should be adapted to better hamiltonians so that the sensitivity of the scattering length to material properties for a wide range of materials can be studied .",
    "this approach should be quite useful for quantum well problems , which have similarities to the bulk problem study here , but have many more experimental parameters that can affect exciton - exciton interaction .",
