    "the mini - disc model was motivated by the estimate for angular momentum of accretion flows , @xmath0 , in wind - fed x - ray binaries ( illarionov & sunyaev 1975 ; shapiro & lightman 1976 ; illarionov & beloborodov 2001 ) .",
    "these systems happen to have @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the gravitational radius of the black hole .",
    "it is marginally sufficient to form a centrifugally supported disc .",
    "then a small disc can form , which is not supported centrifugally and instead accretes on the free - fall time ( beloborodov & illarionov 2001 , hereafter bi01 ) .",
    "the mini - disc accretes so fast ( super - sonically ) that the effects of viscosity can be neglected .",
    "a similar disc may form inside collapsing stars ( lee & ramirez - ruiz 2006 ; beloborodov 2008 ) .",
    "the mini - disc can be thought of as a caustic in the equatorial plane of a rotating accretion flow .",
    "it absorbs the feeding infall , and this interaction releases energy , making the accretion radiatively efficient . with increasing angular momentum",
    ", the size of the disc grows up to @xmath3 , and at this point the centrifugal barrier stops accretion , so that it can proceed only on a viscous timescale .",
    "thus , the mini - disc model fills the gap between two classical regimes of accretion  spherical ( @xmath4 , bondi 1952 ) and standard accretion disc ( @xmath5 , shakura & sunyaev 1973 )  and is qualitatively different from both .",
    "the calculations of bi01 were limited to the case of a schwarzschild black hole . in the present paper",
    "we study the mini - disc around kerr black holes .",
    "the model is constructed under the following assumptions :    \\(i ) the flow is axially symmetric .",
    "we assume that the rotational axes of the accretion flow and the black hole are aligned ( or anti - aligned ) .",
    "\\(ii ) the flow is symmetric under reflection about the equatorial plane .",
    "the symmetric streamlines collide in the equatorial plane and form a ring - like caustic around the black hole .",
    "\\(iii ) the flow falls freely ( ballistically ) from a large radius @xmath6 until it hits the caustic ; its pressure is negligible everywhere except in the mini - disc .",
    "this assumption is valid if the flow is cooled efficiently ( by radiation in x - ray binaries or by neutrinos in collapsars ) .",
    "the heat released in the shocks that accompany the disc - infall interaction is assumed to be quickly radiated away , so that the shocks stay near the disc plane , forming a `` sandwich '' .",
    "the validity of this assumption is discussed in bi01 for the case of x - ray binaries and in beloborodov ( 2008 ) for collapsars .",
    "\\(iv ) the flow is quasi - steady : its accretion rate and angular momentum remain constant on the timescale of accretion through the mini - disc ( which is comparable to the free - fall time from @xmath7 ) .",

    "section  2 describes the parabolic ballistic infall in kerr metric and its ring caustic in the equatorial plane . in section",
