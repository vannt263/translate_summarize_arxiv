    "recent work from deep imaging @xcite and spectroscopic @xcite surveys has shown that much of the rapidly evolving faint blue galaxy population @xcite is comprised of morphologically peculiar galaxies .",
    "these systems may be luminous counterparts to local irregular galaxies , tidally disturbed systems , or perhaps members of entirely new classes of objects with no local counterpart .",
    "another possibility is that these morphologically peculiar systems are simply `` ordinary '' galaxies whose strange appearance is simply a result of their being observed in the rest - frame ultraviolet ( a `` morphological k - correction '' ) , where we know little about the appearance of the galaxy population .",
    "this distinction between intrinsic and apparent peculiar galaxies lies at the heart of this meeting . in this article",
    "several lines of evidence are reviewed which suggest that the bulk of the morphological peculiarities seen in distant galaxies are intrinsic to these systems , and not simply the product of rest - frame bandshifting . in the final section of this article preliminary results from a new line of evidence",
    "are presented , focussing on the `` chain galaxy '' population as a case study .",
    "the first line of evidence is the result of a quantitative comparison between the observed morphologies of local galaxies and the predicted appearance of their _ non - evolved _ high - redshift counterparts . in order to undertake this comparison",
    "we have developed a technique for artificially redshifting local galaxy ccd images by assigning separate spectral energy distributions to individual pixels .",
    "spectral energy distributions for each pixel are determined by using optical colors to interpolate between template spectra corresponding to local s0 , sab , sbc , scd , sdm , and starbursting galaxies .",
    "figure  [ fig : artz ] illustrates the power of this technique by showing the excellent agreement between `` predicted '' and observed far - uv morphologies for a typical galaxy in our calibration sample cosmological dimming extremely long exposure times with hst would be required to image this galaxy at high redshifts with a signal - to - noise level equivalent to that shown . ] .",
    "this figure illustrates the extreme case in which the @xmath0-band morphology is extrapolated to the far - uv , corresponding to redshifts @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , at @xmath1 the galaxian internal dynamical timescale is a substantial fraction of the age of the universe , so the existence of morphologically unevolved galaxies is not expected .",
    "= 3.0 in    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     with this capability to model the effects of bandshifting on observed morphology , _ and by assuming an approximate redshift distribution _ , one is able account for the impact of morphological k - corrections on morphologically segregated deep number - magnitude counts . because the subjective nature of visual classification makes comparisons between different groups susceptible to large systematic errors @xcite ,",
    "the best approach to making these counts is to adopt a quantitative morphological classification system .",
    "several quantitative classification systems have now been developed@xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : counts ] shows the number - magnitude counts which result from applying a particularly simple system ( based on measurements of central concentration , @xmath2 , and asymmetry , @xmath3 ) to data from the hubble deep field . also shown",
    "are the no - evolution predictions for ellipticals , spirals , and irregular / peculiar / merger systems , constructed as described in glazebrook  _ et  al . _  ( 1995 ) and abraham  _ et  al . _",
    "( 1996a , b ) , by adopting schechter luminosity functions ( lfs ) with parameters given by loveday _",
    "( 1992 ) , and a high normalization @xmath4 mpc@xmath5 .",
    "the predicted counts for the elliptical galaxies are based on a flat slope ( @xmath6 ) for the faint - end of the lf , rather than the turn - over originally found by loveday _",
    "et al_. the steep counts for the irregular / peculiar / merger systems continues to the limits of the survey .",
    "beyond @xmath7 the spiral counts show a significant excess over the no - evolution predictions .",
    "a weaker trend is seen for the spheroidal systems ( whose counts are only marginally above the no - evolution prediction ) and there is some evidence of a turn - over in the last magnitude interval .",
    "the analysis presented in the previous section is fairly sensitive to the assumed redshift distribution of the peculiar galaxy population .",
    "however recent evidence from redshift surveys , most notably the canada - france redshift survey ( cfrs ) suggests that , at least to @xmath8 mag ( the typical morphologically resolved magnitude limit for deep hst imaging , prior to the hubble deep field ) , the great majority of objects are at redshifts @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "therefore even quite deep hst wf / pc2 @xmath10-band ( the band most commonly used to quantify the morphological composition of the distant field ) images should generally be compared with @xmath11-band or @xmath12-band local galaxy data . since most local surveys of galaxy morphology are based on blue - sensitive photographic plates , the rest - frame @xmath11-band is in fact where we are most familiar with the appearance of galaxies , and the effects of bandshifting on these galaxies are likely to be less significant than the effects of limited signal - to - noise or binning .",
    "images of local galaxies in @xmath12-band ( blueward of the 4000  break ) are often substantially more irregular than @xmath11-band data , but they do not yet show the fantastic morphological variations ( such as disappearing bulges ) seen in images in the far - uv ( @xmath13 ) , as presented by oconnell and others at this conference .    this line of reasoning has recently been spectacularly confirmed @xcite by brinchmann _",
    "( 1997 ) , who have applied an objective classification scheme , again calibrated using pixel - by - pixel k - corrections , to a set of @xmath14 hst @xmath10-band images of galaxies _ with known redshifts _ taken from the cfrs and ldss @xcite surveys . because the statistical completeness of this sample is very well understood , reliable number - redshift histograms can be constructed for the various morphological types . the morphologically resolved @xmath15 result obtained by brinchmann _",
    "_ is shown in figure  [ fig : nz ] , and confirms that irregular / peculiar / merging systems are already greatly in excess of the predictions of no - evolution and mild - evolution models at redshifts @xmath16 .",
    "it is emphasized that : ( a ) because of the complete redshift information , morphological k - corrections have been accounted for explicitly for each galaxy in this study , and ( b ) in any case morphological k - correction effects can not be dominant in this survey , because the peculiar excess is already large by @xmath17 , at which point one is only just beginning to probe into the ultraviolet .",
    "studies of evolution in high - redshift galaxies have focused generally on either analyses of morphological characteristics , or on analyses of _ integrated _ colors using spectral synthesis techniques .",
    "while morphological studies often point the way forward , only rarely do they probe the underlying physics of galaxy evolution . on the other hand ,",
    "studies of integrated colors are also limited , because galaxies are not homogeneous systems .",
    "galaxy evolution can be described as a series of punctuated star - formation episodes whose imprints are recorded in distinct stellar populations ( such as the disk and bulge ) , so studies which resolve these stellar populations are required in order to understand the mechanisms through which galaxies are built - up and evolve .",
    "therefore it seems that the important next step in understanding the history of galaxies is to unify morphological studies with stellar evolution modelling . in this section we present preliminary results from just such a _ morphophotometric _ analysis of the `` chain galaxy '' population .",
    "we have chosen to focus on this subset of the high - redshift peculiar galaxy population in this article because the controversy surrounding these systems is a perfect encapsulation of the theme of this meeting . in their discovery paper , cowie and collaborators",
    "@xcite claimed to have found a significant new young population of galaxies at high redshifts .",
    "this claim was immediately disputed @xcite .",
    "dalcanton & shectman ( 1996 ) claim that chain galaxies are simply the distant counterparts to local edge - on low surface - brightness spiral galaxies .",
    "can the internal colors of these systems shed light on the nature of these objects ?",
    "consider the central equation of population synthesis @xcite , commonly used to model spectral evolution in galaxies :    @xmath18    in this formulation the emergent flux from a galaxy , @xmath19 , at time @xmath20 is described by the convolution of the spectrum of an evolving instantaneous starburst , @xmath21 , with an assumed star - formation rate ( sfr ) function @xmath22 .",
    "the @xmath21 term is in principle known for various choices of initial mass function ( imf ) and metallicity , using libraries of template stellar spectra and isochrones .",
    "hierarchical formation scenarios suggest that stellar populations become built up over time , so in reality the age @xmath20 of a galaxy is not a constant , and the distribution of internal colors is a partial record of the formation timescale(s ) of the system .",
    "this age information for a given stellar population is diluted by the convolution with @xmath22 , whose form is usually unknown .",
    "but in regions where the resolution is high enough to resolve the sites of current star - formation , or where mixing of multiple generations of stars has not occured , @xmath22 can be approximated by a @xmath23-function , breaking the convolution degeneracy in equation 1 , and allowing direct measurement the age distribution and form of @xmath21 .",
    "consider , for example , the canonical picture of a late - type spiral galaxy , where the bulk @xmath22 can be well - approximated by a constant star - formation rate .",
    "this `` constant '' overall star formation rate is physically simply a time - average over the appearance and disappearance of spatially distinct hii regions and star - formation complexes , each of which individually can be considered to be a bursting simple stellar population with a lifetime ( before disruption or gas depletion ) that is short compared to the dynamical timescale of the galaxy .",
    "therefore the distribution of colors for individual resolved young stellar associations on a color - color diagram directly maps out the shape of @xmath21 for a set of young ages , giving direct access to the integrand of equation  1 without first filtering by a convolution .",
    "as these stellar associations age and disappear the convolution with @xmath22 in equation 1 becomes important , as young stars become assimilated into older galactic components ( ie . the disk and bulge ) and are spatially averaged with earlier generations of stars . the distribution of colors for older stellar populations ( 1 gyr ) are therefore expected to trace out a continuous age track on the color - color diagram .",
    "the _ shape _ of this track for older stellar populations is in effect a measurement of the form of the star - formation law @xmath22 , while the _ distribution _ of colors along this track is a record of the uniformity with which episodes of star formation have added to the stellar population ( via numerous small bursts , or a smaller number of larger bursts ) .",
    "= 4.0 in    figure  [ fig : spirell ] shows the resolved color - color diagram for two rather typical spiral and elliptical galaxies in the hdf .",
    "these exhibit star - formation characteristics that are in reasonable agreement with our expectations based on studies of stellar populations in local galaxies .",
    "for example , the spiral galaxy is well described by a roughly constant star formation history .",
    "the bulge is the oldest component of this system , has a small dispersion in color , and is several gyr older than the disk . by contrast",
    "the elliptical system shown is well described by an exponential star - formation history with a short e - folding timescale ( around @xmath24 gyr . )",
    "this system is apparently rather old and ( from the small dispersion in color ) , all parts of the galaxy are well mixed and roughly coeval .",
    "the majority of spirals and ellipticals in the hubble deep field exhibit morphophotometric diagrams qualitatively similar to those shown in figure  [ fig : spirell ] .",
    "= 5.0 in      figure  [ fig : chain ] shows a montage of resolved color - color diagrams for the three `` chain galaxies '' ( as visually classified by r. ellis ) with known redshifts in the hubble deep field .",
    "the morphophotometric analysis shown in this figure indicates that these systems are likely to be very young galaxies recovering from their first star - formation episodes . unlike the case for late - type galaxies exhibiting knots of star - formation superposed on a disk ( as shown in figure  [ fig : spirell ] )",
    ", there is no evidence for an underlying `` old '' component in any of these systems . using the surface brightness detection threshold for the @xmath10 data",
    ", we can place an upper limit of @xmath25 for the contribution of old stars to the total baryonic mass of two systems at @xmath9 systems shown in this figure shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : chain ] , because of strong k - corrections for red light at @xmath26 .",
    "however , depending on @xmath27 , restrictions on such a component may be imposed by the age of the universe in the rest frame . ] .",
    "all components of the chain galaxies lie close to the `` pure '' starburst track : evidently rather little mixing of young components within the body of the galaxy as occurred .",
    "( this mixing would show up as a dispersion along the exponential or constant star formation tracks , as populations with different ages blend together ) .",
    "intriguingly , the knots of star - formation in the lower - redshift chains appear to be synchronized , both spatially and temporally .",
    "star - formation has been triggered along the body of these system like a string of fireworks .",
    "the oldest knots in the @xmath9 systems appear to have ignited the other knots in sequence along the body of the galaxies . in all cases",
    "shown the unweighted mean age of the starlight in the galaxy is 100 - 200 myr ( comparable with the dynamical timescale of the galaxy ) , with the youngest and oldest knots in the chain differing in age by around 30 - 50 myr .",
    "_ this morphophotometric analysis indicates that these chain galaxies are likely to be stochastically ignited very young galaxies , and not edge - on low - surface brightness spirals , as has been claimed . _",
    "although it is important to bear in mind that the three systems presented in this article may not be representative of the class ( being taken from an incomplete redshift survey , with strong biases toward strong emission - line systems ) , it appears that at least _ some _ chain galaxies ( _ i.e. _  all chain galaxies in the redshift sample to date ) are protogalactic starburst systems .",
    "the taxonomy of peculiar galaxies is confusing and possibly inconsistent , but studies using objective classifications calibrated by simulations offer a way forward .",
    "these studies show that contamination by bandshifted late - type galaxies into samples of `` peculiar '' galaxies is small until @xmath28 , at which point the observed fraction of irregular / peculiar / merging systems is already much higher than predicted on the basis of no - evolution models .",
    "we therefore conclude that `` morphological k - corrections '' are a second - order effect , and do not account for the proportion of irregular / peculiar / merging systems seen on deep hst images . at higher redshifts contamination by bandshifted spirals",
    "may be more important , although genuinely protogalactic systems are definitely seen .",
    "at least some `` chain galaxies '' are protogalaxies  strongly starbursting systems forming their first generation of stars  and _ not _ not edge - on low surface brightness systems .    *",
