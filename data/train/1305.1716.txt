    "the importance of shock - cloud interactions for feedback in star formation has motivated a number of groups to perform 3d mhd simulations of shocks interacting with single clouds @xcite .",
    "none of these simulations included self - gravity and only those of @xcite and some of those of @xcite included radiative cooling .",
    "like the two dimensional simulations of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , @xcite considered the production of cooler regions by including the thermal instability of warm phase material .",
    "@xcite focussed on x - ray emission and cloud destruction rather than the cloud internal structure .",
    "this paper concerns the effects of shocks , which are likely to be driven by the outflows of recently born stars , on cores in molecular clouds .",
    "a core is assumed to be in an isothermal magnetized equilibrium state , such as those considered by @xcite and is magnetically sub - critical i.e. its mass - to - flux ratio is somewhat below the critical value for the core to collapse under gravity .",
    "the analysis of infrared polarization maps of some molecular clouds has shown that they contain pc scale cores that are magnetically sub - critical @xcite .",
    "we shall see that , although even quite weak shocks can produce a large increase in density , this does not lead to gravitational collapse in ideal mhd .",
    "however , self - gravity does retard the subsequent re - expansion .",
    "we intend to include ambipolar diffusion and the hall effect in future work ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the calculations were performed with the hierarchical adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) code , mg @xcite .",
    "this solves the equations of ideal mhd using a second order upwind scheme with the linear mhd riemann solver described in @xcite combined with the divergence cleaning technique described in @xcite .",
    "a hierarchy of @xmath0 grids levels , @xmath1 , is used , and the mesh spacing for @xmath2 is @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the cell size for the coarsest level , @xmath5 . @xmath5 and @xmath6 cover the entire domain , but finer grids need not do so .",
    "refinement is on a cell - by - cell basis and is controlled by error estimates based on the difference between solutions on different grids i.e. the difference between the solutions on @xmath7 and @xmath2 determine refinement to @xmath8 .",
    "self - gravity is computed using a full approximation multigrid to solve the poisson equation .",
    "the initial core has density @xmath9 , sound speed @xmath10 and radius @xmath11 and is embedded in a warmer uniform medium with sound speed @xmath12 and pressure @xmath13 .",
    "this is implemented by defining an advected scalar , @xmath14 , that is unity in the cloud and zero in the surroundings . the sound speed , @xmath15 ,",
    "is then given by @xmath16 .",
    "this scalar is also used to turn off gravity in the external medium .",
    "both the core and its surroundings are threaded by a uniform magnetic field with magnitude @xmath17 .",
    "we use dimensionless units in which @xmath18 , @xmath19 and the gravitation constant @xmath20 . in these units",
    "the core has @xmath21 and a free - fall time of @xmath22 . for the adopted units ,",
    "the initial magnetic pressure is @xmath23 ( note that we have suppressed factors of @xmath24 in the equations ) .",
    "this initial core is not in equilibrium , but evolves into an equilibrium state provided the mass - to - flux ratio is below a critical value .",
    "this equilibrium state , which is produced by the collapse of a uniform , non - rotating , isothermal , spherical core , is the same as one of those specified by @xcite .",
    "for a zero temperature core , the critical value of mass to flux ratio is given by @xcite    @xmath25    since , in case of ideal mhd , the mass - to - flux ratio does not change , we have    @xmath26    we set    @xmath27    which gives an initial plasma @xmath28    @xmath29    the equilibrium core has an oblate shape with an aspect ratio @xmath30 .",
    "the maximum value of the density is @xmath31 and the maximum value of @xmath28 is @xmath32 .",
    "all calculations were performed on a three - dimensional cartesian grid , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , with the centre of the core at the origin .",
    "initially @xmath36 grids were used with a resolution of @xmath37 on @xmath5 , which gives an effective maximum resolution of @xmath38 ( @xmath39 for the initial cloud ) . note that @xmath5 needs to be coarse in order to ensure fast convergence of the multigrid poisson solver . for the evolution to the equilibrium state ,",
    "free flow boundary conditions were imposed on all boundaries .",
    "this resolution is more than adequate for the equilibrium state , but as we shall see , is not sufficient to resolve the high density region that is produced by the shock interaction .",
    "however , the code has the ability to change the number of levels during the course of the calculation , so that additional levels could be added as necessary .",
    "a fast - mode shock was introduced onto a grid containing the equilibrium core by setting the conditions on the @xmath40 plane to the postshock state for such a shock in the negative @xmath41 direction with and upstream state corresponding of that of the warm medium .",
    "we consider two cases : perpendicular ( @xmath42 ) and oblique ( @xmath43 ) , where @xmath44 is the angle between the shock normal and the upstream magnetic field far from the core .",
    "for the perpendicular shocks , the equilibrium core was generated from an initial state with the magnetic field in the @xmath45 direction , but for the oblique shock it was at @xmath46 to the @xmath45 axis .",
    "we chose to characterize the strength of the shock by its alfven mach number    @xmath47    where , @xmath48 is the shock speed in the upstream rest frame and @xmath49 is the the alfvn speed given by    @xmath50    in our equations .",
    "this has the advantage that an oblique shock has the same speed as a perpendicular shock with the same value of @xmath51 .",
    "[ fig : shockevolve ] shows the density for a perpendicular shock with @xmath52 at four times , measured from the time that the shock was introduced . as can be seen from the figure , a filamentary high density region is formed , which is highly flattened parallel to the magnetic field . in order to resolve this , it was necessary to add an extra three grid levels as the calculation proceeded to give an effective resolution of @xmath53 ( @xmath54 for the initial cloud ) .",
    "even so , this is barely sufficient to resolve the high density region in its most compressed state .",
    "[ fig : obshockevolve ] shows that the oblique shock also generates a dense region .",
    "careful examination of the results shows that the dense region is the result of shock focussing by the density gradient at the edge of the core . a plane shock that encounters such a density gradient",
    "is refracted until its direction of propagation becomes parallel to the density gradient ( much like water waves on a sloping beach ) . in the perpendicular case , this leads to strong focussing on the @xmath55 plane where the density contours have a small radius of curvature . as in a munro jet @xcite",
    ", this would lead to a large pressure and hence density even if there were no magnetic field , but here the velocities along the field are of the order of the post - shock alfvn speed , which is significantly higher than the gas sound speed in the core . as a result ,",
    "convergence along the field lines leads to a higher density than in the purely hydrodynamic case .",
    "it is possible to estimate the way in which the maximum density scales with @xmath51 and the initial @xmath28 in the core . for a perpendicular isothermal shock ,",
    "the compression ( see appendix in @xcite ) is    @xmath56 , \\label{exacttau}\\ ] ]    where @xmath57 is the upstream @xmath28 .",
    "the post - shock total pressure is then    @xmath58    where @xmath17 is the upstream magnetic field .    for the incident shock in the low density medium",
    "we have @xmath59 ( @xmath60 in our case ) and we can ignore the gas pressure to get    @xmath61    if we also ignore @xmath62 compared with @xmath63 . the post - shock pressure is then given by    @xmath64    where @xmath65 is the initial magnetic field .",
    "we can get a lower limit on the density behind the shock propagating into the core by assuming a perpendicular shock with post - shock pressure @xmath66 .",
    "this is clearly a lower limit since it ignores shock convergence , the post - shock pressure is greater than @xmath66 due to the reflected shock and the compression is greater if the shock is oblique .",
    "the shock is clearly oblique for @xmath67 since it is propagating along the density gradient , while the field in the equilibrium core is very nearly parallel to the @xmath45 direction .",
    "if @xmath68 is the compression in this shock , then ( [ exactp ] ) gives    @xmath69    where and @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the magnetic field and @xmath28 in the core .",
    "solving this for @xmath68 gives    @xmath72 .",
    "\\label{taucore}\\ ] ]    for low - temperature cores close to criticality , @xmath73 , but although @xmath74 , it is not really small",
    ". nevertheless , we shall neglect it to get    @xmath75    since the shock is actually oblique , the post - shock velocity along the field lines is of the order of the shock velocity except near @xmath76 . the strength of the shock is considerably increased by convergence , so that we can assume that it is strong , in which case its velocity , @xmath77 , is given by    @xmath78    which becomes    @xmath79    upon substitution for @xmath66 and @xmath68 from ( [ approxp ] ) and ( [ apptaucore ] ) .",
    "the orientation of the shock relative to the field lines is such that the flow parallel to the field is directed towards @xmath80 , which means that we have two streams with velocity @xmath81 and density @xmath82 that collide at @xmath76 .",
    "this produces a density of    @xmath83    substituting for @xmath68 and @xmath84 from ( [ apptaucore ] ) gives    @xmath85    in our case we have @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , which gives @xmath89 . as we can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : maxdense ] , the maximum density is much higher than this ( @xmath90 ) , which is presumably because we have neglected both the effect of shock convergence and the reflected shock on the strength of the shock in the core .",
    "for @xmath91 , the simulation gives @xmath92 = 315 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : maxdense ] ) , whereas the multiplication of the @xmath86 simulation result for @xmath92 by @xmath93 , where @xmath94 , gives @xmath95 .",
    "this disagreement is not too surprising since the assumption of strong shocks is not valid for such low mach numbers",
    ". it would be nice to look at larger values of @xmath51 , but it then becomes very difficult to resolve the thickness of the high density region .",
    "all this tells us that ( [ rhomax3 ] ) only gives a rough indication of the maximum density , but we have established that this mechanism can produce surprisingly high densities even for relatively weak shocks .",
    "[ fig : maxdense ] also shows that the oblique shock produces densities of the same order as the perpendicular shock , which means that the effect is not dependent on a precise alignment of the shock normal with the @xmath80 plane .",
    "although the oblate shape of the equilibrium core means that shock convergence is less important if the shock normal is not perpendicular to the field , this is compensated by the fact that the density is higher behind the more oblique shock in the core .    in fig",
    "[ fig : maxdense ] we have also plotted the maximum density for the perpendicular case with self - gravity switched off once the shock begins to interact with the core .",
    "this clearly shows that self - gravity has no effect on the evolution up to the point at which the maximum density is reached , but that it does slow down the subsequent re - expansion . in both cases",
    "the very high density does not persist for long , but the density is still substantially larger than the initial value even at the latest times .",
    "the main result of this paper is that , even for weak shocks , shock focussing leads to surprisingly large increases in density in shock - core interactions .",
    "this is entirely an mhd effect , but self - gravity is nevertheless essential to the process .",
    "the shock is focussed by the density gradient in the gravitationally bound cloud and the re - expansion of the dense region is prevented by its self - gravity .",
    "@xcite have argued that ambipolar diffusion in a time - dependent shock can lead to a transition from a magnetically sub - critical to magnetically super - critical state .",
    "the inclusion of ambipolar diffusion and hall processes in future work of the interactions of shocks with cores will therefore be of considerable interest .",
    "the very large increases in density that we have found suggest that the results of @xcite , who considered plane - parallel flows only , provide rather conservative estimates of the extent to which transient effects in shocks are likely to increase the mass - to - flux ratio .",
