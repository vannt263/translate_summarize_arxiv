    "one of their major applications is in the comparison of dna sequences from different organisms or individuals by making use of a software tool like blast  @xcite .",
    "however , at some parts of the above genomic sequences in blast , we may want to be more tolerant than at other parts , since for example some of them may be biologically less significant or we have less confidence in the exact sequence due to sequencing errors in more error prone genomic regions .",
    "this concept leads naturally to the notion of _ multitolerance _ graphs which generalize tolerance graphs  @xcite .",
    "the main idea is to allow two different tolerances for each interval , one to each of its sides .",
    "then , every interval tolerates in its interior part the intersection with other intervals by an amount that is a convex combination of these two border - tolerances .",

    "efficient algorithms are known for tolerance and multitolerance graphs .",
    "however , only few of them have been derived using the ( multi)tolerance representation ( e.g.  @xcite ) , while most of these algorithms appeared as a consequence of the containment of tolerance and multitolerance graphs to weakly chordal ( and thus also to perfect ) graphs  @xcite . to design efficient algorithms for ( multi)tolerance graphs",
    ", it seems to be essential to assume that a suitable representation of the graph is given along with the input , as it has been recently proved that the recognition of tolerance graphs is -complete  @xcite .",
    "recently two new geometric intersection models in the 3-dimensional space have been introduced for both tolerance graphs ( the _ parallelepiped _",
    "representation  @xcite ) and multitolerance graphs ( the _ trapezoepiped _",
    "representation  @xcite ) , which enabled the design of very efficient algorithms for such problems , in most cases with ( optimal ) @xmath41 running time  multitol - mertzios14,msz - model - sidma-09 . in spite of this , the complexity status of some algorithmic problems on tolerance and multitolerance graphs still remains open , three decades after the introduction of tolerance graphs in  @xcite .",
    "arguably the two most famous and intriguing examples of such problems are the _ minimum dominating set _ problem and the _ hamilton cycle _ problem ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "both these problems are known to be -complete on the greater class of weakly chordal graphs  @xcite but solvable in polynomial time in the smaller classes of bounded tolerance and bounded multitolerance ( i.e. , trapezoid ) graphs  @xcite .",
    "the reason that these problems resisted solution attempts over the years seems to be that the existing representations for ( multi)tolerance graphs do not provide enough insight to deal with these problems .    [ [ our - contribution . ] ] our contribution .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    in this article we introduce a new geometric representation for multitolerance graphs , which we call the _ shadow representation _ , given by a set of line segments and points in the plane . in the case of tolerance graphs ,",
    "this representation takes a very special form , in which all line segments are horizontal , and therefore we call it the _ horizontal shadow representation_. note that both the shadow and the horizontal shadow representations are _ not _ intersection models for multitolerance graphs and for tolerance graphs , respectively , in the sense that two line segments may not intersect in the representation although the corresponding vertices are adjacent .",
    "however , the main advantage of these two new representations is that they provide substantially new insight for tolerance and multitolerance graphs and they can be used to interpret optimization problems ( such as the dominating set problem and its variants ) using computational geometry terms .",
    "apart from being important on their own , these new representations enable us to establish the complexity of the _ minimum dominating set _",
    "problem on both tolerance and multitolerance graphs , thus solving a longstanding open problem . given a horizontal shadow representation of a tolerance graph @xmath10 , we present an algorithm that computes a minimum dominating set in polynomial time . on the other hand , using the shadow representation , we prove that the minimum dominating set problem is -hard on multitolerance graphs by providing a reduction from a special case of the set cover problem .",
    "that is , there exists no polynomial time approximation scheme ( ptas ) for this problem unless = .",
    "this is the first problem that has been discovered with a different complexity status in these two graph classes .",
    "therefore , given the ( seemingly ) small difference between the definition of tolerance and multitolerance graphs , this dichotomy result appears to be surprising .",
