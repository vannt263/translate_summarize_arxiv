    "ever since the bcs theory identified the phonon exchange mechanism as the cause for electron pairing leading to a superconducting state and , at the same time , pinned down the order of magnitude for the critical temperature @xmath0 , considerable efforts were undertaken to bypass these constraints on @xmath0 .",
    "one of the leading ideas was to look for fluctuating local diamagnetism caused by intrinsic atomic correlations which would act as an essential component for pairing in the many - body electron wavefunction . since diamagnetic pairs of electrons",
    "necessarily lead to local lattice deformations , one searched for materials@xcite where such deformations would exist on a dynamical level , as close as possible to , but not at , a global lattice instability .",
    "this was thought to favor optimal diamagnetism and strong superconducting correlations , without leading to localization which would originate from static lattice instabilities .    in this line of thinking ,",
    "systematic studies were undertaken searching for compounds liable to show charge disproportionation , originating from unstable `` formal '' valence states of the cations which build up such structures .",
    "those formal valence states , required by the chemical stoichiometry given a certain crystalline environment , are skipped .",
    "as a result , such materials become composed of a mixture of cations with one more and one less charge , respectively . examples for such valence skippers which are unstable",
    "are tl@xmath2 , pb@xmath3 , sn@xmath3 , bi@xmath4 , sb@xmath4 .",
    "these elements prefer to exist as tl@xmath5 , pb@xmath2 , sn@xmath2 , bi@xmath3 , sb@xmath3 together with tl@xmath3 , pb@xmath4 , sn@xmath4 , bi@xmath6 , sb@xmath6 .",
    "it implies a tendency to electron pairing and for that reason has attracted , early on , much attention for possible non - phonon - mediated superconductivity of purely atomic origin .",
    "charge disproportionation then originates from effective negative-@xmath7 centers to which the electrons , associated with the cations with unstable valence configurations , are attracted and form bound electron pairs .",
    "casting such physics in terms of a negative-@xmath7 anderson model gives rise to a variety of macroscopic phases , such as charge fluctuation - driven superconductivity,@xcite correlation - driven insulating states , translationally symmetry - broken charge - ordered states , etc .",
    "for the exactly half - filled band case , the stable valence configurations ( differing by two electrons ) are degenerate and as a result ensure resonant pair tunneling in and out of charge kondo impurities.@xcite    the mechanism behind valence skipping has been a highly debated subject and for a long time was attributed @xcite to an intrinsic intra - atomic interplay between the electron affinity and the ionization energy , combined with a crossing of stable closed 4@xmath8 , 5@xmath9 , 6@xmath8 electron shells .",
    "it has become increasingly evident in recent years that valence skipping and the resulting charge disproportionation systematically appear together with distinct deformations of the cation - ligand complex , which strongly depend on which valence state they are in .",
    "thus , in order to overcome the relatively large on - site coulomb repulsion,@xcite strong madelung potentials and strong covalent bonding,@xcite an adequate polarizibility of the material and sufficiently large dielectric constants ( @xmath10)@xcite must play together so that charge disproportionation can be realized .",
    "it is now largely considered that the prime mechanism for charge disproportionation lies in the local lattice relaxations of the ligands surrounding those cations.@xcite this picture , closer to the traditional scenario originally hypothesized for localized defects in semiconductors,@xcite however now requires taking into account a time retarded - rather than static - exchange interaction between bound electron pairs and itinerant electrons .",
    "the question we address in this paper is to what extent charge disproportionation can be realized in form of dynamical diamagnetic double charge fluctuations on effective sites , composed of cations and their surrounding ligand environments .",
    "the latter are deformed by local lattice instabilities which change their bond - lengths or angles . in this way ,",
    "two electrons are either captured from the fermi sea in form of a self - trapped bipolaron or are released onto the cations in the immediate vicinity where they become itinerant again .",
    "one can thus hope for a resonant tunneling of pairs of electrons in and out of such polaronic sites , inducing local dynamical pair correlations in the itinerant sector of the electron system . in this sense",
    "our scenario is similar to that of fermionic atomic gases in which a global superfluid phase is induced by a feshbach resonance@xcite which describes the charge exchange interaction between bound electron - spin triplet states and electron - spin singlet scattering states . for such coherent pair tunneling to occur in our counterpart solid state example , the charge and ligand deformation fluctuations will have to be highly correlated with each other .",
    "we shall examine here to what extent this is feasible .",
    "if the exchange of the two types of double charge carriers is sufficiently efficient , such charge disproportionation materials and , possibly in a wider sense , the copper oxides and their non - bcs like superconductivity , could be due to the resonant bipolaron mechanism described above .",
    "particularly well studied examples of such materials are :    \\(a ) pb@xmath11tl@xmath12te@xcite with the parent compound pbte which is a small gap semiconductor . upon doping with tl , which exist as tl@xmath3 in this compound and",
    "plays the role of a kind of negative-@xmath7 center , pb@xmath11tl@xmath12te becomes a superconductor with a relatively high value of @xmath13k , considering its small carrier density .",
    "for details we refer the reader to an extensive literature on this subject , see refs.7 , 8 and references therein .",
    "\\(b ) babi@xmath12pb@xmath11o@xmath14@xcite and b@xmath15k@xmath12bio@xmath14 with the parent compound babio@xmath14 which is a diamagnetic insulator with a charge - ordered state involving alternating bi@xmath16 and bi@xmath17 ( from now on we shall use the more appropriate denomination accounting for covalency for the formal valence states , indicated by roman numeral in the superscripts ) .",
    "band theory predicts a metal on the basis of a formal valence state bi@xmath18 .",
    "the charge - ordered state is stabilized due to a highly anisotropic polarization of the @xmath19 ligand environment,@xcite inciting positional changes in the two stable valence species of the bi ions .",
    "bi@xmath17 is in a regular octahedra ligand environment , with a bi@xmath20o distance of @xmath21 .",
    "bi@xmath16 is in a pseudo - octahedral ligand environment where one of the six oxygen ions in the octahedra is displaced to such an extent ( with a corresponding bi@xmath20o distance of @xmath22 ) that it is effectively becoming o@xmath23 after having transferred an electron to the cation.@xcite the total outcome is a structurally different ligand environment which favours a bi@xmath16 valence state . partially substituting ba by k results in a superconducting state with a relatively high value of @xmath24k , which has been considered as an example of superconductivity induced by double - valence fluctuations.@xcite    \\(c ) charge disproportionation",
    "is also seen on a molecular , rather than atomic , level in systems such as ti@xmath25o@xmath26,@xcite v@xmath27o@xmath28@xcite and wo@xmath29,@xcite in which one observes diatomic pairs of ti@xmath30ti@xmath16 together with ti@xmath31ti@xmath4 , v@xmath32v@xmath18 together with v@xmath33v@xmath17 , and w@xmath33w@xmath17 together with w@xmath34w@xmath35 , respectively .",
    "these different valence states of the molecular units again show distinctly different intra - molecular distances , such as @xmath36 for ti@xmath37ti@xmath16 and @xmath38 for ti@xmath39ti@xmath18 bonds .",
    "moreover , with increasing temperature these systems exhibit a thermally activated conductivity by pair hopping .",
    "this demonstrates the stability of such bound electron pairs on deformed molecular units which are locked together in a dynamical fashion with the charge fluctuations .",
    "\\(d ) indications for dynamical charge fluctuations are also seen in the cuprate superconductors .",
    "here the situation is however more involved .",
    "stable valence states of cu exist as :    \\(i ) cu@xmath40 in a dumbbell oxygen ligand environment , with a characteristic cu@xmath20o bond - length of @xmath41 ( examples are cu@xmath27o , bacu@xmath27o@xmath27 , fecuo@xmath27 ) ;    \\(ii ) cu@xmath42 in square planar oxygen ligand environments with a characteristic cu@xmath20o bond - length of @xmath43 ( an example is cuo@xmath25 ) ;    \\(iii ) cu@xmath16 in square planar oxygen ligand environments , in rare cases , with a characteristic cu@xmath20o bond - length of around @xmath41 , and hence practically identical to that of cu@xmath40 in dumbbell environments@xcite ( an example is kcuo@xmath27 ) .    in the cuprates",
    "the formal valency of cu lies between @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the square lattice of the cuprates is neither a strict square planar nor a dumbbell ligand environment and there is no indication for a static disproportionation of cu@xmath42 .",
    "cu@xmath16 , which should be favored in this cuprate planar lattice structure , could appear only through rapid metallic fluctuations or be due to the stoichiometry of the structure , with an atypical madelung potential.@xcite yet , local dynamical lattice fluctuations involving the oxygen ligands of the planar cu ions , the cu@xmath20o bond stretch ( or buckling ) modes , exist .",
    "they can be considered as being linked to charge fluctuations involving local ligand environments which are typical of stable cu@xmath40 and cu@xmath16 . in the anti - nodal region of the brillouin zone , where the electronic density of states ( dos ) is dominated by the the pseudogap phenomenon , local scanning tunneling microscope ( stm )",
    "spectroscopy@xcite did establish a strong coupling of electrons with wave vectors @xmath46 = [ \\pm \\pi,0]$ ] and @xmath47 $ ] and local phonon modes with characteristic frequencies distributed around @xmath48mev .",
    "the isotope variation of these modes ( most likely associated to the cu@xmath20o bond stretch mode ) correlates with that of the pairing gap .",
    "this strongly indicates that this local cu@xmath20o bond stretch mode could play a significant role in the pairing mechanism of the cuprates .",
    "if double charge fluctuations do play a significant role in establishing a superconducting phase , they have to sustain a free particle - like behavior with spatial phase coherence .",
    "this should occur in spite of the sizeable lattice relaxation which , a priori , tends to render them rather diffusive .",
    "if in this largely diffusive dynamics we can obtain a finite component of coherent phase - correlated double charge fluctuations , then a superconducting state can materialize .",
    "such a state does not describe a purely bosonic system of bipolarons and bipolaronic superconductivity , but is characterized by resonating bipolarons embedded in a fermi sea .",
    "their signature is a pseudogap in the single - particle dos at the fermi level due to strong pairing correlations above the superconducting phase .",
    "this scenario has been discussed in great detail over the past years on the basis of the boson - fermion model by j. ranninger and collaborators .    to address the question of the feasibility of coherent pair tunneling",
    ", we consider charge carriers capable of existing either as selftrapped bipolarons or as itinerant quasi - free tight - binding charge carriers on a small clusters consisting of :    \\(i ) cation - ligand complexes which are deformable and which can capture the charge carriers in form of bipolarons ;    \\(ii ) square plaquettes composed of four structurally identical cations - ligand complexes ( surrounding the deformable central cation - ligand complex ) , which we consider as undeformable .",
    "charge carriers on these plaquettes shall hence move as itinerant entities rather than being captured by polaronic effects .",
    "double charge fluctuations in the present picture implies fluctuations between doubly occupied and unoccupied sites , driven by charge carriers tunneling in and out of such sites and ultimately resulting in pair correlations among those on the plaquette sites .",
    "such essentially local physics contains the essence of triggering a crossover from an insulating purely charge - disproportionated state to a superconducting state upon tuning certain parameters such as the electron - lattice coupling , the adiabaticity ratio or the charge carrier density .",
    "this physics , intrinsically related to a very local mechanism,@xcite manifests itself in the single particle spectral function , the local diamagnetism , the local phonon softening , the quasi - elastic peak in the neutron scattering cross - section for the phonons and the double - peaked pair distribution function for the bond - length fluctuations .    in section",
    "ii we discuss the salient features of such double charge fluctuations driven by bond - length fluctuations and present a scenario in terms of a kind of holstein model which takes into account the different ligand fluctuations characterizing the various charge configurations . in section iii we propose a model hamiltonian which we consider to be adequate to describe the local physics of such systems . we discuss its basic features as far as the efficiency of local pair tunneling is concerned and how such dynamically correlated charge - ligand deformation fluctuations are locked together in order to form phase - coherent correlated itinerant excitations on a short spatial scale . in section",
    "iv we discuss the specific characteristics of : ( i ) the local lattice dynamics close to instabilities , phonon softening , the quasi - elastic peak in the dynamical structure factor and the double peak structured pair distribution function , ( ii ) the diamagnetic correlations induced among the itinerant electrons via such dynamical local lattice instabilities and how they manifest themselves in a pseudogap feature in the electronic density of states . in the summary , section v , we briefly review the main findings of the present work and discuss the further issues which have to be treated next .",
    "the crossover from metallic , or superconducting , to localized behaviour in electron - lattice coupled systems has been a topic of longstanding interest and debate.@xcite the issue has been reinvestigated with renewed vigor in recent years , when it became apparent that an insulating phase of localized polaronic charge carriers , bordering on a superfluid phase , can be induced by many - body correlation effects.@xcite earlier widely pursued ideas considered density - driven stripping off of the phonon clouds of individual polarons@xcite and a related to it possible breakdown of wigner polaron crystallization@xcite into a metallic phase .",
    "correlation - driven localization can be turned into correlation - driven superconductivity by small modification of certain tunable experimental parameters .",
    "real systems where such and similar phase changes are manifest ( cuprates , manganites , transition metal oxides , magnesium diborides , just to name a few ) are complex in their structure as well as in the composition of their metal - ion - ligand electronic configurations .",
    "their particularity lies in a prevailing local physics , which has been generally overlooked in theoretical studies of the polaron problem .",
    "this local physics nevertheless dictates the outcome of macroscopic states such as ( i ) a superconducting phase of itinerant electrons with cooper pairing , ( ii ) an insulating phase of localized bipolarons , and , possibly , ( iii ) a phase corresponding to a bose metal sandwiched between the two , which has become of particular interest in recent years.@xcite since the physics of electron - lattice coupled systems involves local atomic or molecular displacements , it requires a description in terms of small polarons , i.e. , electrons dragging with them a sizable local lattice deformation which can be of the order of a tenth or so of the lattice constant .",
    "we have for that reason to rely on the picture of a holstein - type molecular crystal model as the basis of our study .    as a paradigm for systems with resonant pairing induced by local lattice deformations",
    ", we can imagine as the simplest scenario a bipartite lattice like the one illustrated in fig.1 and consisting of :    \\(a ) a sublattice of polaronic sites , where the charge carriers couple locally and strongly to the molecular deformations of the ligands , resulting in localized bipolaronic bound pairs in the cation - ligand bonds ;    \\(b ) a sublattice of non - polaronic sites on which the electrons ( holes ) move as itinerant charge carriers .        when the charge transfer between the two sublattices is switched on , the electron ( hole )",
    "pairing on polaronic sites , leading to localized bipolarons , will compete energetically with the itinerancy of uncorrelated charge carriers on the non - polaronic sites in their immediate vicinity , when their respective energies are comparable .",
    "this induces pair correlations among the otherwise intrinsically uncorrelated itinerant charge carriers in locally very * confined * regions of the lattice . on a macroscopic scale , this local physics ( when treated on the basis of a heuristic boson - fermion model scenario ) ultimately results in a competitions between a correlation - driven insulating phase and a superconducting one.@xcite the transition from one phase into the other can be tuned by varying the strength of the electron - lattice coupling , the size of the adiabaticity ratio , the relative ionic potential difference between the polaronic and the non - polaronic sites , and the concentration of the charge carriers .",
    "specific interconnected local properties in such systems , which are determinant for the physics on a macroscopic scale , are :    \\i ) the generation of an intrinsic pseudogap feature in the local electronic density of states@xcite which , depending on the parameters of the system , foreshadows an insulating or a superconducting gap ;    \\ii ) the strong softening and a concomitant increase of spectral weight of local vibrational modes on the polaronic sites,@xcite serving as a basic ingredient for the bipolarons to acquire itinerancy and assuring a component of bosonic charge carrier transport ;    \\(iii ) the double - peak structure in the local lattice displacement pair distribution function due to a quantum coherent superposition@xcite of bipolarons and pairs of intrinsically uncorrelated electrons in their immediate vicinity , which can result in dynamically fluctuating stripe - type topological structures .",
    "the approach to the polaron problem followed here is similar to procedures followed in the correlation problem,@xcite based on anderson s resonating valence bond idea.@xcite .",
    "there , an intrinsic underlying magnetic structure leads to the formation of local singlet hole pairs on plaquettes , dynamically exchanging with pairs of uncorrelated itinerant holes in their immediate vicinity .",
    "as concerns the connections with other electron - phonon models , the present paradigm of a fluctuating bipartite lattice structure of polaronic and non - polaronic effective sites is qualitatively different from the usually studied molecular crystal holstein model , where all the sites are considered to be equivalent .",
    "moreover , when the attention is focused on charge kondo - like resonance features,@xcite the local electron - phonon coupling is assumed to be of the form @xmath49 $ ] , i.e. it is at any site symmetric with respect to the single - site occupation . on the other hand , as we have stressed in the beginning ,",
    "systems with double charge fluctuations show strong anisotropy of their ligand deformations .",
    "this motivates us to take an asymmetric electron - lattice coupling of the form @xmath50 $ ] . although the modulus of the displacements of either unoccupied or doubly occupied sites relative to the singly occupied sites , i.e. @xmath51 , is the same for the two types of couplings ( symmetric and asymmetric ) , the respective energies , related to the electron - lattice coupling , are not .",
    "for the usual symmetric electron - phonon coupling the energies of the unoccupied and doubly occupied site are degenerate .",
    "it is this which results in the kondo - type resonance in the charge channel,@xcite provided that the chemical potential of the system is such that this degeneracy , representing the two stable valence configurations , is guaranteed , which is the case for the exactly half - filled band limit .",
    "away from this limit this is not the case and the resonance disappears.@xcite .",
    "a further and essential difference between the generic holstein scenario and the present paradigm for resonant pairing systems , is that in the valence fluctuation scenario the ligands of two adjacent cations have an anion in common .",
    "this leads to strong intersite correlations between cations with different valence states and correspondingly different ligand environments compatible with this bridging oxygen .",
    "these facts differentiate between sites where the bipolarons form and sites in the immediate vicinity where they do not .",
    "this is similar to what happens with zhang - rice singlets in cuprates,@xcite where singlet pairs form on a cu ion and its immediate ligand environment of four oxygens , but where nearest - neighboring cu ions can not behave as such zhang - rice singlets at the same time .",
    "this `` exclusion '' feature@xcite introduces in the end strong local correlation effects in the band structure of the whole system , which is part of the salient features of the cuprates .",
    "our proposition here is that the local polaronic features of double charge fluctuations should have a similar effect on the overall band structure and in particular will give rise to a charge pseudogap of polaronic origin .",
    "the aim of this work is to examine the local physics of polaronic systems lending themselves to double charge fluctuations , coupled via an exchange term to itinerant charge carriers .",
    "they impose on the latter strong local dynamical diamagnetic fluctuations which can eventually lead to a global phase - locked superconducting state .",
    "we shall do this here , having in mind the cuprates and in particular their normal phase properties .",
    "these systems are more complicated than the paradigm for resonant pairing systems discussed in the previous section , in the sense that all the cu cations are intrinsically equivalent and there is no translational symmetry breaking to be expected from the outset . yet , we had early - on strong experimental indications@xcite that the structural correlations and deformations in the cuprates show remnant bipartite lattice features , on a local level as well as on a finite time scale .",
    "these topologically different features , generally referred to as `` stripes '' , break the translational , as well as the rotational , symmetry on a local level .",
    "the application of the valence fluctuation scenario , describing possible resonant pairing in high-@xmath0 superconducting cuprates , implies , for the reasons clarified below , the consideration of three formal valence configurations in the cuo@xmath27 layers , cu@xmath40 , cu@xmath42 and cu@xmath16 .",
    "distinct ligand deformations are associated with them , dumb - bell for cu@xmath40 and square planar for cu@xmath42 and cu@xmath16 , but differing from each other by the value of the cu@xmath20o distances ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "the cu cations in the cuo@xmath27 layers of the insulating parent compound have a square oxygen ligand environment with cu@xmath20o distances equal to 1.94 @xmath52 and are in formal valence states cu@xmath42 , according to their chemical composition .",
    "moreover , the cuprates represent a metastable structure characterized by a geometric misfit of the various layers@xcite which leads to cu@xmath20cu distances in the cuo@xmath27 layers which can accommodate such [ cu@xmath53o@xmath54 $ ] units ( see fig.2a ) only by pushing the oxygens alternately slightly above and below these layers .",
    "this structural effect is usually called buckling .    upon hole doping",
    "one introduces single holes in such [ cu@xmath55o@xmath54 $ ] units , which make them turn into [ cu@xmath37o@xmath54 $ ] units , with shortened cu@xmath20o distances equal to 1.84@xmath56 . referring to our small cluster , such a doped effective cation - ligand unit",
    "is represented by the central effective site 5 in fig.2b .",
    "the reduction to 1.84@xmath56 of the bond - lengths in the [ cu@xmath30o@xmath54 $ ] units is accompanied by an unbuckling of the four oxygen cations belonging to these units , which are pulled into the cuo@xmath27 plane , but keep unaltered their distances from the cu@xmath42 ions on the plaquette sites , thus inducing no long - range stress field . in this way , the oxygen cations surrounding each of the cu@xmath42 ions ( located at sites 1 - 4 in fig.2b ) are still all at the same distance 1.94@xmath56 from it , but one of them [ the bridging oxygen between cu@xmath28 and cu@xmath57 ( @xmath58=1@xmath204 ) ] now lies in the cuo@xmath27 plane and not above or below it .",
    "we conjecture that the [ cu@xmath30o@xmath54 $ ] units with their doping - induced ligand deformations act as polaronic traps , binding two holes in form of a localized bipolaron .",
    "if the energy of this state is almost degenerate with that of the hole states at the fermi level , then this bipolaron can split into two holes going on the surrounding matrix , and , as a consequence , [ cu@xmath37o@xmath54 $ ] turns into [ cu@xmath59o@xmath54 $ ] . as pointed out in the previous section ,",
    "cu@xmath40 is typically in a linear o@xmath20cu@xmath20o dumb - bell configuration .",
    "if we suppose that this happens also in the cuo@xmath27 layers , we are faced with two degenerate o@xmath20cu@xmath20o dumbbell bonds along the @xmath60 and @xmath61 directions , with a shortened bond - length of 1.84@xmath62 ( see fig.2c ) which is the same as for the [ cu@xmath30o@xmath54 $ ] units .",
    "this would cause an anisotropic unbuckling of the corresponding bridging oxygens in either one or the other direction , but leaving the cu@xmath53o@xmath25 units on the plaquette sites unaltered , as far as their cu@xmath20o bond - lengths are concerned .",
    "it is also feasible that , given this directional degeneracy of the bonds of the cu@xmath40 valence states , an isotropic ligand deformation with the same bond - length of 1.84@xmath56 materializes , due to @xmath63 hybridization in the cuo@xmath27 plane@xcite and which then would be very similar to the configuration illustrated for the cu@xmath37o@xmath25 unit in fig.2b .",
    "it would lead to an isotropic unbuckling , again with no changes in the bond - lengths of the cation - ligand units on the plaquettes .",
    "the microscopic foundation of the various formal valence configurations , conjectured here to play a role in the cuprates , are left to be investigated in the future . for the present study , where we shall treat the ligands as an effective deformable scalar quantity , we do not deal with such detailed questions concerning the anisotropy of the deformations on the central sites acting as resonating bipolaronic traps .",
    "the valence fluctuations involving the central [ cu@xmath30o@xmath54_5 $ ] unit lead to the release of two holes from the latter onto the neighboring [ cu@xmath55o@xmath54_i$ ] units on the plaquette sites @xmath58=1@xmath204 , and vice - versa ( [ cu@xmath30o@xmath54_5 \\leftrightarrow $ ] [ cu@xmath64o@xmath54_5 $ ] + two holes ) . once on the plaquette units , these holes engage in itinerant states which prevent them from getting localized in form of self - trapped bipolarons on those [ cu@xmath55o@xmath54_i$ ] units .",
    "such a mechanism describes tunnelling in and out of hole pairs from a given central deformable ligand [ cu@xmath20o@xmath54_5 $ ] unit ( our effective site 5 ) into the surrounding [ cu@xmath53o@xmath54_i$ ] units which remain essentially undeformed . for this reason we neglect here",
    "any charge - ligand deformation coupling on those plaquette sites .",
    "we remind the reader that formal valence in such systems has to be interpreted in terms of the charges involved in the covalent bonds between the cations and their ligand environments and not simply by the charges on the cation . in the cuprates",
    "the covalent character in the cuo@xmath27 planes is very pronounced .",
    "this might be one reason why spectroscopically neither cu@xmath16 nor cu@xmath40 have been detected sofar .",
    "furthermore , given the fact that the three formal valence states cu@xmath40 , cu@xmath42 and cu@xmath16 have different ligand environments , the coupling of those deformations to the charge will in general not be symmetric with respect to singly occupied units [ cu@xmath55o@xmath25 ] . in the planar cuo@xmath27 layer of the cuprates all the cu ions are equivalent and their charge coupling to the ligand deformations are spatially homogeneous . but this coupling does depend on the formal cu valence state which is active at any given moment . if we consider the cuprates as being made out of an ensemble of overlapping clusters , as given in fig.2 , this immediately leads to local dynamical correlations between neighboring ligand deformations . on a short range",
    "we can therefore expect that this will naturally lead to intercalated topological local structures .",
    "the anisotropy of the o@xmath20cu@xmath66o bonds could be relevant for the anisotropic local symmetry breaking .",

    "would be using renormalization group techniques such as the plaquette contractor method , based on small clusters of the form illustrated in fig.2 .",
    "this method was developed by morningstar and weinstein@xcite and applied to the rvb scenario by altman and auerbach@xcite .",
    "for the present scenario of valence fluctuation driven pairing , including the various ligand deformations correlated to the formal valence state of the clusters , presents a formidable numerical task .",
    "questions like that will be addressed in some future work .    here we shall content ourselves to study the dynamics of such basic clusters making up the cuo@xmath27 layers , which permits us to draw some preliminary conclusions on such macroscopic phases . considering an ensemble of such spatially and temporarily uncorrelated fluctuating clusters , without any long - range spatial phase coherence between them , allows us to describe certain features of the pseudogap phase in the cuprates and its corresponding onset temperature @xmath1 .",
    "we can assess the frequency of the resonant pair tunneling processes , driven by the local ligand deformation fluctuations ( which play the role of local dynamical lattice instabilities in a macroscopic system ) and which can be approximately related to the mass of the diamagnetic pair fluctuations and thus to the value of @xmath0 for the onset of a bose - einstein condensation - driven superconductivity .    in order to capture the salient features of the local physics of valence fluctuations in the cuprates ,",

    "the question arises of the structure of the superconducting state which not only will have to involve the phase coherence of the charge but also of the lattice instabilities driving the charge pairing .",
    "this implies cooperative effects acting between such dynamically fluctuating local clusters , which we expect to result in fluctuating topological structures of the lattice , where insulating correlations compete with superconducting ones .",
    "a field theoretical formulation of the boson - fermion model,@xcite not taking explicitly into account the lattice degrees of freedom , has some similarity to the picture of a coarse - grained superconducting state of spatially randomly distributed bosonic modes.@xcite however , the main difference between this approach and the one based on the boson - fermion model is that in the latter the local inhomogeneities can fluctuate like in josephson junction arrays with inter - grain tunneling .    treating the cuprates within this scenario will as a next step require a microscopic treatment of the ligand environment .",
    "this means : ( i ) explicitly taking into account the different formal valence states of the cu - ligand complex , ( ii ) incorporating the strong hubbard u correlations in our present scheme , resulting in local zhang - rice singlets , and ( iii ) study the dynamical charge exchange between such cation - ligand complexes and the surrounding metallic matrix beyond the single cluster model ( discussed here ) and beyond any adiabatic approximation.@xcite these and other related questions will be dealt with in some future work .",
