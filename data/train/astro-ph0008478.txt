    "@xcite , hereafter paper i ) has revealed that 45% of all bulges ( s0-sd galaxies ) are box- and peanut - shaped ( b / p ) .",
    "this high frequency must be considered in a theory of bulge formation and especially in scenarios explaining the formation process of b / p bulges .",
    "currently discussed theories of bulge formation are primordial or secular evolution scenarios . while monolithic collapse ( eggen et al . @xcite ( els ) ) , clumpy collapse ( kauffmann et al .",
    "@xcite , baugh et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and inside - out formation ( van den bosch @xcite , kepner @xcite ) are proposed for primordial bulge formation , merging processes ( wyse et al . @xcite and references therein ) and dynamical evolution triggered by bars ( e.g. combes et al .",
    "@xcite ) are the basis of secular evolution scenarios .",
    "however , combinations of both scenarios are also possible ( combes @xcite ) .    in the last 20 years several working hypothesis about the origin of b / p bulges have been developed .",
    "external cylindrically symmetric torques can act on an initially non - rotating triaxial spheroidal stable system so that it becomes box - shaped ( may et al .",
    "@xcite ) . however , such torques are `` problematical to relate to some astrophysical counterparts '' ( combes et al .",
    "mergers of two disk galaxies are proposed by binney & petrou ( @xcite ) and rowley ( @xcite ) as a possible formation process of b / p bulges .",
    "however , such a scenario requires very special conditions such as the precise alignment of the spin and orbital angular momenta of the two galaxies ( bureau @xcite ) .",
    "a more common process to form b / p bulges could be the accretion of satellite galaxies , although an oblique impact angle of the satellite is needed ( binney & petrou @xcite , whitmore & bell @xcite ) and the mass of the accreted satellite is constrained .",
    "if it is too large , the stellar disk would be disrupted ( barnes @xcite , hernquist @xcite ) . the origin of b / p bulges by bars was first proposed by combes & sanders ( @xcite ) .",
    "this theory was strongly supported ten years later by the studies of combes et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , raha et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , and pfenniger & friedli ( @xcite ) dealing with n - body simulation of disk galaxies .    the connection between b / p bulges and the presence of a bar is difficult to prove by surface photometry , because b / p bulges are observable only in almost edge - on galaxies",
    ". however , there is photometric evidence in a few edge - on galaxies from cuts parallel to the major axis ( de carvalho & da costa @xcite , dettmar & ferrara @xcite ) and in two intermediately inclined galaxies ( bettoni & galletta @xcite , quillen et al .",
    "@xcite ) pointing to bars .",
    "additionally , kinematic observations of around 20 b / p bulges with characteristic bar signatures in velocity fields and in orbit analyses ( e.g. kuijken & merrifield @xcite ) are reported .",
    "in addition , our statistics ( paper i ) have shown that the overall frequency of barred galaxies ( @xmath1 55% , paper i , knapen et al .",
    "@xcite ) is able to explain the high fraction of b / p bulges .    on the other side observational evidence for accreted material in b / p bulges",
    "is found by bureau & freeman ( @xcite ) for a few b / p bulges .",
    "indirect evidences are substructures and asymmetries in some special b / p bulges ( dettmar @xcite , dettmar & barteldrees @xcite , ltticke et al .",
    "@xcite , hereafter paper iii ) .",
    "combes et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and shaw ( @xcite ) conclude from their investigation of b / p bulges , listed by jarvis ( @xcite ) , de souza & dos anjos ( @xcite ) , and shaw ( @xcite ) , that they show less evidence for significant merging and are likely not the result of recent accretion events .",
    "however , b / p bulges can indirectly originate from interaction and finally accretion by triggering the formation of bars ( noguchi @xcite , gerin et al .",
    "@xcite , walker et al .",
    "@xcite ) , which then actually build up the b / p structures ( fisher et al .",
    "@xcite , mihos et al .",
    "therefore the search for bars is one of the best ways to discriminate between the proposed evolutionary scenarios of b / p bulges .",
    "the essential advantage of investigations in the nir is the small extinction by dust at these wavelengths ( rieke & lebowsky @xcite , knapen et al .",
    "therefore the influence of the dust lane in the plane of edge - on galaxies is largely reduced by nir observations , especially in the @xmath2-band . in this way",
    "the structure of a galaxy near the plane in radial as well as in vertical direction can be analysed and thereby bars detected ( dettmar & ferrara @xcite ) .",
    "in addition it is even possible to determine parameters of bars , e.g. their thickness and projected length .",
    "therefore it is possible to investigate the connection between bars and shapes of bulges .",
    "observations were carried out at the 1.5 m tirgo / gornergrat in 1994/95 ( run identification : ti ) with nicmos3 arnica ( 0.92@xmath3/pixel ) , the 1.2 m telescope at calar alto in june 1996 ( ca4 ) and june 1997 ( ca2 ) with magic ( rockwell nicmos3 array ) using the high resolution mode ( 1.2@xmath3/pixel ) , the 2.2 m telescope at calar alto during two runs in january 1997 ( ca3 ) and march 1998 ( ca1 ) also equipped with magic ( hr mode : 0.64@xmath3/pixel ) , and at eso / la silla with the 2.2 m telescope in may 1998 ( e1 ) with irac-2b ( nicmos3 array ) using the lc objective ( 0.49@xmath3/pixel ) . to the resulting sample of 56 galaxies",

    "( 6 ) : as col .",
    "( 5 ) , but with 70% barred and 30% unbarred galaxies +      along the bar major axis of the simulated galaxy , measured in the face - on case ( @xmath8 ) , the decrease of the surface density is exponential ( pfenniger & friedli @xcite ) and the length of the bar can be determined to @xmath120 kpc .",
    "this length exactly fits inside the radius of corotation which occurs at 10 kpc ( pfenniger & friedli @xcite ) .",
    "the axis ratio of the bar is @xmath9 ( fig . [ sim ] , top right ) and is inside the range of observed values ( 0.2 - 1 ) ( martin @xcite ) .",
    "regarding the galaxy edge - on ( @xmath10 ) with an edge - on orientated bar ( @xmath11 ) is the best way to derive the quantitave bar parameters ( introduced in section 3 ) of the simulated galaxy , because bar and b / p structures are most prominent at this geometry .",
    "however , the cuts along and parallel to the major axis do not reveal the typical bar signature ( fig .",
    "[ simcut ] ) which is visible in the nir observations .",
    "the three components bulge , bar , and central part of the bulge can not be distinguished as it is possible in the observations ( cf .",
    "[ n2654 ] , [ n7332 ] , and [ n1175 ] ) . due to the lack of a bar signature the bar thickness as well as the central bulge length ( cbu ) can not be determined .",
    "the ratio of bal / bul @xmath12 , taking into account bal @xmath13 kpc and bul @xmath14 kpc ( fig .",
    "[ simcut ] ) , is not consistent with the observed ratios for peanut bulges ( @xmath15 ) ( fig .",
    "[ balbul ] ) , while bal / bpl @xmath16 ( bpl @xmath18 kpc ; fig .",
    "[ simcut ] ) is consistent with observed ratios in peanut bulges ( bal / bpl @xmath17 ) . while in observations",
    "the positions of the maxima of the b / p distortion coincide with the limits of the central bulge , in the n - body simulation the positions of the maxima are not related to any other features in the profiles .      the differences between the galaxy derived from the n - body simulation and the observed galaxies likely result from the initial conditions of the simulated model .",
    "pfenniger & friedli ( @xcite ) are just using two merged disks with the same rotation properties instead of an independent bulge component in their simulation .",
    "the inner disk represents the `` bulge '' and is chosen with the main purpose `` to have sufficient freedom to shape the initial rotation curve '' .",
    "therefore the initial resemblance with a real bulge is only approximate .",
    "using such a bulge component in the simulation could also be the reason for the lack of the bar signature when the galaxy is seen edge - on , since the inner disk could cover the signature .",
    "another explanations for the fact that no bar signature is visible could lay in the limited spatial resolution or in the lack of gas in the simulation , which influences the bar structure .",
    "it is also possible that the exponential decrease of the bar surface brightness and the smooth end of the bar prevent the detection of a bar signature .",
    "additionally , the investigated simulated galaxy is only a single , although representative , example of a barred galaxy . variations of the initial conditions such as the bulge - to - disk ratio , q parameter , gas fraction and distribution , and halo structure end up in different bar strenghts , shapes , thickness , lenghts , and density profiles in n - body simulations ( e.g. friedli & benz @xcite ) .",
    "therefore conclusions drawn from comparisons between our statistics of observed bulge types ( paper i ) and results from the simulated galaxy , which is investigated in this study , are limited .",
    "future studies have to analyse recently published simulations of barred galaxies ( e.g. pfenniger @xcite ) to get more relevant comparisons with observations .",
    "the strong correlation of the bar signature with b / p bulges in our study shows that b / p bulges are well explained by dynamical processes in bar potentials .",
    "the ratio of the bar length to the length of the b / p distortion ( bpl ) ( @xmath18 ) in the simulated barred galaxy and the observed ratio of bal / bpl ( @xmath19 ) in galaxies with peanut bulges is consistent with such a scenario .",
    "the correlation of the bar signature with b / p bulges is previously claimed , using the same detection method , by the investigations of individual galaxies , namely ngc 1381 ( de carvalho & da costa @xcite ) , ngc 5170 ( dettmar & barteldrees @xcite ) , and ngc 4302 ( dettmar & ferrara @xcite ) .",
    "many further evidences for the connection between bars and b / p bulges are reported in the literature : bettoni & galletta ( @xcite ) and quillen et al .",
    "( @xcite ) find them in their investigation of the intermediately inclined galaxies ngc 4442 resp .",
    "ngc 7582 . furthermore ,",
    "n - body simulations ( e.g. combes et al .",
    "@xcite , raha et al .",
    "@xcite , pfenniger & friedli @xcite ) show that the evolution of a b / p bulge is coupled with the development of a bar .",
    "independent evidence is obtained by observing the gas kinematics in nii and h@xmath20 . the characteristic `` figure - of - eight '' rotation curve which is a strong signature for the presence of a bar and is detected in many b / p bulges : e.g. ngc 5746 , ngc 5965 ( kuijken & merrifield @xcite ) , ngc 2683 ( merrifield @xcite ) , and additional ten further galaxies by bureau & freeman ( @xcite ) and five by merrifield & kuijken ( @xcite ) .",
    "control samples of non - b / p bulges show no kinematical signature of a bar ( bureau & freeman @xcite , merrifield & kuijken @xcite ) . in two b / p bulges (",
    "eso 597- 36 and ngc 3390 ) without kinematic bar signature bureau & freeman ( @xcite ) find indications for accretion events .",
    "however , since the positioning of the slit was difficult ( bureau & freeman @xcite ) , dust in the galactic plane could affected their observations .",
    "therefore bars can not be excluded in these two galaxies . a merger - induced bar formation with a resulting b / p bulge ( mihos et al .",
    "@xcite ) could be a possible scenario for these galaxies .",
    "the four detected non - b / p bulges : ngc5907 ( miller & rubin @xcite ) , ic5096 , eso240 - 11 ( bureau & freeman @xcite ) , and ngc 681 ( merrifield & kuijken @xcite ) with a bar signature in the gas kinematics can be explained by our analysis of the n - body simulation with bars which are nearly end - on ( see next subsection ) .",
    "signatures of the gas kinematics in barred potentials are also detected in retrograde orbits of ngc 128 ( emsellem & arnault @xcite ) , the galaxy with one of the most prominent b / p bulges ( donofrio et al .",
    "@xcite ) . direct kinematic evidence for bar streaming motions in two galaxies with b / p bulges ( ngc 3079 and ngc 4388 ) is presented by veilleux et al . ( @xcite ) . furthermore ,",
    "in hi the presence of a bar is also verified in one galaxy with a peanut bulge analysing the position velocity diagram ( ic 2531 : bureau & freeman @xcite ) .",
    "the gas kinematics in the central region obtained in co ( @xmath21 line ) in the case of ngc 3628 ( reuter et al .",
    "@xcite ) , ngc 891 ( garcia - burillo & guelin @xcite ) , and ngc 4013 ( garcia - burillo et al .",
    "@xcite ) again point to the presence of a bar .    the conclusion ( often given in the literature , e.g. pfenniger & friedli @xcite ) , that b / p bulges are thick bars , can not be supported . from the observational point of view bars and bulges , if b / p - shaped or not , are obviously individual components with different lengths ( e.g. fig .",
    "[ n2654 ] ) .",
    "stellar orbits in a barred potential build up b / p structures and the bar itself .",
    "therefore b / p bulges are the composition of a spheriodal bulge and a b / p structure representing the thick part of the bar .",
    "the non - detection of bars ( table [ connec ] ) in all observed tbbs ( @xmath15% of all b / p bulges belong to this group , paper iii ) is an indication for the hypothesis that the boxiness of these bulges is not related to the the presence of a bar .",
    "this idea gets more convincing support from the fact that the extent of the box shape is too large to result from an usual bar potential ( paper iii ) .",
    "however , the lack of a bar signature does not necessarily mean that there is no bar , since weak bars , which have exponential surface brightness profiles ( elmegreen & elmegreen @xcite ) , could remain undetecable by the here presented search for a bar signature .",
    "in this way also the missing bar signature in the simulated barred galaxy is explainable , because the surface density distribution along the simulated bar is exponential and additionally , the bar axis ratio of this galaxy points to a weak bar ( @xmath22 , martinet & friedli @xcite ) .",
    "the connection between b / p bulges and bars can be understood as interplay between resonant bending fed by vertical diffusion of orbits and instabilities similar to the fire - hose one ( bureau @xcite , friedli @xcite ) .",
    "while there is evidence for this connection in the most galaxies with b / p bulges , the question for the different shape of the b / p bulges remains to be answered .",
    "a correlation between a strong signature of a bar , marked by constant surface brightness in radial direction ( cf . section 3 ) , and prominent b / p bulges is found in our study .",
    "thereby the strong bar signature can be associated with a flat bar , which is known to be strong ( elmegreen & elmegreen @xcite ) .",
    "therefore the correlation can be interpreted by the assumption that strong barred galaxies are responsible for prominent b / p bulges , while galaxies with a weak bar have bulges with a lower degree of boxiness .",
    "n - body simulations by friedli ( @xcite ) support this explanation for different bulge shapes . in this way",
    "it is also possible to explain partly the observed correlation of bal / bul with the bulge type ( cf .",
    "section 4 ) by larger bars in galaxies with prominent b / p bulges , because flat bars tend to be larger ( elmegreen & elmegreen @xcite , elmegreen et al .",
    "since this correlation holds for early as well as for late types , it can not be explained by the fact that the same bar will produce more pronounced b / p bulges , the smaller the pre - existing spheroidal bulge is .",
    "however , having this in mind it is not surprising that the weak bar of the here investigated simulated galaxy can produce a peanut bulge .",
    "furthermore , one could expect that peanut bulges more often occur in late type spirals , but the observed fraction of peanut bulges in galaxies in the range of s0-scd is rather constant and equal to zero in spirals later than sc ( paper i ) .",
    "this result could be interpreted by a dependence of the bar strength on the hubble type .",
    "such a correlation of bars is found by elmegreen & elmegreen ( @xcite ) and elmegreen et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "however , in contrast to them seigar & james ( @xcite ) do not find that flat ( strong ) bars are more common in early hubble types and exponential ( weak ) bars in later types .",
    "this statement is in agreement with our results for the profiles of bar signature concerning the hubble type , but it is uncertain , if their results concerning bar morphology detected in face - on galaxies can be transformed to bar signatures in edge - on galaxies .",
    "additionally , for the explanation of bulge shapes it has to be taken into account that gas mass and a central black hole effect the shape of bulges . a significant fraction of gas mass ( berentzen et al .",
    "@xcite ) or a supermassive central black hole can weaken the b / p structure ( friedli @xcite ) .    explaining bulge shapes by aspect angles of bars was introduced by n - body simulations ( combes et al . @xcite , pfenniger & friedli @xcite ) .",
    "kinematical bar diagnostics in edge - on spiral galaxies using simulations of families of periodic orbits and hydrodynamical simulations are also consistent with observations .",
    "they confirm the dependence of the boxiness on the aspect angle of the bar ( bureau & athanassoula @xcite , athanassoula & bureau @xcite ) .",
    "an exact determination of aspect angles is not possible , because the envelope of the signature of the outer bar region in the position - velocity diagram is too faint ( athanassoula & bureau @xcite ) .",
    "the strong correlation of bal / bul with the bulge type and the agreement of the observed ratio bal / bul only of the most prominent b / p bulges , @xmath15 , with that ratio obtained for face - on galaxies , @xmath23 ( athanassoula & martinet @xcite , baumgart & peterson @xcite , martin @xcite ) , shows that the differences in bal / bul can be interpreted by different aspect angles of bars .",
    "therefore our analysis points also to a dependence of the shape of a bulge on the aspect angle of the bar . in this way and",
    "consistent with our investigation of the simulated barred galaxy peanut bulges result from bars seen nearly edge - on ( large projected bar length , bal ) , boxy bulges from intermediately inclined bars , and elliptical ones from end - on bars ( small bal ) or they have no bar at all .",
    "thereby bars detected in non - b / p bulges can be explained as well as differences between the fraction of barred galaxies ( 70% in the nir ) and galaxies with b / p bulges ( 45% ) , although also other parameters might play a role ( weak bar , large gas mass , or dominant bulge component ) .",
    "the dependence of the bulge shape on the aspect angle of the bar is also supported in our study by the modified frequencies of the bulge types derived in the simulation .",
    "these frequencies are consistent with the observed frequencies of the bulge types , if one keeps in mind that only a single simulated barred galaxy is compared with all morphological types of disk galaxies .",
    "larger bulge components in the simulation would weaken the b / p structures and thereby reduce the modified frequency of b / p bulges .",
    "stronger bars would have the contrary effect on the modified frequency .",
    "additionally , many galaxies of our investigated sample with peanut bulge and strong bar signature show features at the ends of the bumps , which can be associated with spiral arms extending outward from the ends of a bar ( baggett & mackenty @xcite ) .",
    "therefore it can be suggested that bars of these galaxies are indeed nearly edge - on .",
    "there exists only a few rough estimates of aspect angles of bars in edge - on galaxies from observations .",
    "wakamatsu & hamabe ( @xcite ) adopt for ngc 4762 ( bulge type 3 in the optical , type 4 in the nir ; paper i ) an aspect angle of the bar of @xmath24 ( although a lower limit of 21@xmath25 is also possible from their argumentation ) and garcia - burillo & guelin ( @xcite ) for ngc 891 ( bulge type 2 ) @xmath26 .",
    "these results are in agreement with a dependence of the bulge shape on the bar aspect angle .",
    "the coincidence of the positions of the maxima of the b / p distortion with the limits of the central bulge , which is found here for the first time , can not finally be explained ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "selection effects due to different aspect angles of the bar , which would influence the length of the b / p distortion ( bpl ) , can be neglected , since we have shown that peanut bulges , for which bpl is defined only , can be associated with nearly edge - on bars .",
    "the coincidence points also to a possible connection between the bar length and the length of the central bulge ( cbu ) , since bpl is connected with bal .    therefore possible explanations could be related to secondary bars ( e.g. friedli @xcite , greusard et al .",
    "this idea is supported by the result from n - body simulations ( friedli & martinet @xcite ) that the corotation of the inner bar roughly coincides with the location of the horizontal inner lindblad resonance ( ilr ) . at this position",
    "also the maximum of the elevation of the peanut structure occurs , because the vertical ilr is very close to the horizontal ilr and the conjunction of these two resonances build up the peanut structure ( combes et al .",
    "@xcite ) . however , the observed ratio of the bar lengths of the primary to the secondary , which ends near corotation ( greusard et al .",
    "@xcite ) , varies between 4.0 and 13.4 ( friedli et al .",
    "@xcite ) , respectively 2.7 and 7.1 ( greusard et al .",
    "@xcite ) , while the ratio of bar length to length of the central bulge is much smaller and varies only between 2.4 and 3.1 .",
    "the central bulge could also be associated with a primordial bulge , which influences the bar structure and the position of the horizontal ilr . since at this location also",
    "the peanut structures is most prominent , the extent of the b / p distortion would depend on the mass and length of the primordial bulge .",
    "such a hypothesis is supported by n - body simulations in which the size of the evolving bar is directly related to the initial size of the bulge ( pfenniger @xcite ) . in this way",
    "the nearly constant ratio of bar length or bpl to cbu would be a natural result .",
    "the correlation between cbu and bpl and especially the cbu / bpl ratio of 1 could also be explained by nuclear rings .",
    "they correspond to the horizontal ilr of bars ( buta & crocker @xcite , buta & combes @xcite ) and therefore occur at the same radial position as the maximum of the elevation of the peanut structure",
    ". a nuclear ring could be responsible for the increase of the surface brightness , which we observe in radial cuts near the plane ( fig .",
    "[ n2654 ] , [ n7332 ] , [ n1175 ] ) , or the ring is only the border for the central bulge .",
    "however , we have not seen any structure inside the central bulge pointing to rings , but it is likely that our resolution is too low to detect them .      since we know now with high probability the fact that bars in peanut bulges are edge - on orientated , it is for the first time possible to determine the thickness of bars by observations . from the mean value of bal / bat for the galaxies with peanut bulges a ratio of bar length to thickness of @xmath0 ( taking the error in bal and bat into account ) is derived .",
    "this value is at the upper limit of the values estimated in the literature ( ranging from 4 to 15 , sellwood & wilkinson @xcite ) .",
    "it must be mentioned that bars are more extended in the nir than in the optical ( friedli et al .",
    "@xcite , chapelon et al .",
    "@xcite ) . however , from a sample of nine barred galaxies ( wozniak et al .",
    "@xcite , friedli et al .",
    "@xcite ) investigated in the @xmath28- and @xmath2-band we have computed that this effect is only of the order of @xmath15% . therefore our rather large value for the ratio is not an effect of the observed wavelengths .",
    "we have analysed a sample of edge - on disk galaxies in the nir and images derived from a n - body simulation of a barred galaxy using cuts parallel to the major axis and our classification of bulge shapes introduced in paper i. our main conclusions are :    * cuts along and parallel to the major axis of edge - on galaxies show a strong correlation between bars and b / p bulges .",
    "this correlation is for the first time verified in a larger sample of galaxies ( n @xmath29 ) . *",
    "the investigation of the bar signatures in the nir reveals a correlation between prominent b / p bulges and strong bar signatures pointing to a dependence of the boxiness of a galaxy on the bar strength . *",
    "the ratio of the projected bar length ( bal ) to the length of the bulge ( bul ) correlates with the bulge types , i.e. with the bulge shape .",
    "this correlation is the first evidence from surface photometry for an explanation of the different degree of boxiness by the aspect angle of a bar .",
    "the maximum of this ratio for galaxies with peanut bulges is consistent with ratios observed in face - on galaxies . *",
    "the ratio of bal to the length of the b / p distortion ( bpl ) has a mean value for the observed peanut bulges of @xmath19 .",
    "this value is consistent with the investigated n - body simulation where a ratio of @xmath18 can be derived for an edge - on galaxy with an edge - on bar . *",
    "the frequencies of bulge types in the simulated galaxy , seen under different aspect angles of a bar and under high inclinations , are consistent with the observed frequencies corrected for the total fraction of barred galaxies .",
    "these results support the interpretation that bars viewed under different angles in edge - on galaxies play a major role for the bulge shape .",
    "however , the viewing angle is not the only parameter , since the size of the pre - existing spheroidal bulge and various bar shapes and types also influence the bulge shape . * interpreting galaxies with peanut bulges as galaxies with a bar seen edge - on the ratio of bar length to thickness , @xmath30 , can be directly measured for the first time . * from the observational point of view bars and b / p bulges are different components revealed by their different lengths .",
    "the inner part of barred disk galaxies can be described by three components : the spheroidal bulge ( including the central bulge ) , the bar ( = thin bar ) , and the b / p structure ( = thick bar ) .",
    "* we have found a new size relation of the positions of the maxima of the b / p distortion with the extent of the central bulge ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "this size relation is most likely related to the in - plane ilr of the bar .",

    "<S> we have observed 60 edge - on galaxies in the nir in order to study the stellar distribution in galaxies with box / peanut - shaped bulges . </S>",
    "<S> the much smaller amount of dust extinction at these wavelengths allows us to identify in almost all target galaxies with box / peanut - shaped bulges an additional thin , central component in cuts parallel to the major axis . </S>",
    "<S> this structure can be identified with a bar . </S>",
    "<S> + the length of this structure scaled by the length of the bulge correlates with the morphologically classified shape of the bulge . </S>",
    "<S> this newly established correlation is therefore mainly interpreted as the projection of the bar at different aspect angles . </S>",
    "<S> galaxies with peanut bulges have a bar seen nearly edge - on and the ratio of bar length to thickness , @xmath0 , can be directly measured for the first time . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the correlation of the boxiness of bulges with the bar strength indicates that the bar characteristic could partly explain differences in the bulge shape . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , a new size relation between the box / peanut structure and the central bulge is found . </S>",
    "<S> our observations are discussed in comparison to a n - body simulation for barred galaxies ( pfenniger & friedli @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the inner region of barred disk galaxies are build up by three distinct components : the spheroidal bulge , a thin bar , and a b / p structure most likely representing the thick part of the bar . </S>"
