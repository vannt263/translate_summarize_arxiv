    "because of their extreme luminosity in @xmath1-rays , gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) are a unique probe to high energy regimes where exotic physics is likely to manifest .",
    "a fraction of grbs have been associated with the collapse of massive stars via the association of supernova signatures observed with the fading grb optical afterglow e.g. @xcite .",
    "the afterglow most likely originates from an external shock produced as the blast wave from the progenitor collides with the interstellar medium , causing it to slow down and lose energy . fast moving telescopes linked to gcn notices @xcite are able to record the optical counterpart at the time when the prompt @xmath2ray emission is still active .",
    "the first positive detection of such event was grb  990123 @xcite .",
    "some other successful detections have been achieved so far ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "two general results have been seen : either a bright optical emission , uncorrelated to the gamma - ray light curve , occurred ( for 5 to 20% of grbs according to * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or that a faint optical emission is correlated with the gamma - ray flares ( , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the former case",
    ", these bright optical flashes are often interpreted as the reverse shock signature @xcite . + time lags between x  ray and gamma - ray data are often observed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "from the trailed image , a horizontal profile corresponding to the predicted position of the afterglow gives directly the light curve .",
    "we measured the temporal sampling of 6.5 sec / pixel using trails of bright stars .",
    "the light curve of the afterglow in the trail presents a flare within 3 pixels ( fig .",
    "[ tarot_bat ] ) , with a probability of @xmath21 to be spurious .",
    "the probability to observe a cosmic ray at that position is @xmath22 ( estimated from dark fields of the same night ) .",
    "we thus conclude that this flare is real and produced by the burst itself .",
    "such light curve profiles are affected by the point spread function ( psf ) of tarot . in order to compare the optical and @xmath2ray light curves , we need to convolve the bat signal by the tarot psf .",
    "the psf can be extracted as a vertical profile of a bright non saturated star ( seen as the doted curve in the figure[tarot_bat ] ) .",
    "we performed a symetrisation of the psf shape to be compatible with the hypothesis that the psf shows no direction effect .",
    "once convolved with the tarot psf , the bat signal corresponding to one peak is very similar to that of tarot .",
    "we note at the start of the trail a bright single pixel that could be associated with the end of an optical flare . however , this event is not significant enough to be used in our analysis .",
    "nonetheless , it could be an optical flare related to the first @xmath2ray pulse . in the following analysis",
    ", we will consider this as a possibility , and thus that the optical flare is correlated to the second @xmath1-ray pulse , without discarding the possibility that the optical flare is linked to the first @xmath1-ray pulse",
    ".    a @xmath23 fit between the optical flare and @xmath2ray pulse implies a temporal lag of @xmath24 s ( see fig .",
    "[ tarot_lag ] ) at the 97% confidence ( @xmath25 s if the optical flare is related to the first @xmath1-ray pulse ) .",
    "this is strong evidence for a positive time - lag between the optical and high energy feature .",
    "we point out that the exposure time of tarot images has a better accuracy than 0.1s because we use a gps card triggered by the opening of the shutter , and is not dependent on the computer internal clock variations @xcite .",
    "as the tarot psf is larger than the bat second pulse , we also studied the influence of the duration of the bat pulse modelized by a gaussian shape , letting free the width of the gaussian within the fit .",
    "the best match of the modelized bat pulse is a gaussian spread by sigma=4.0sec .",
    "the @xmath23 fit gives the same lag as for the actual bat pulse meaning that the profile shape of the pulse does not constrain the lag value .",
    "the fit remains compatible for gaussians with sigma lower than 9sec .",
    "this means the optical pulse is compatible with a high energy pulse which could have a duration between 0 to 9sec .",
    "the flux of the optical peak observed by tarot is 0.45 mjy . to be compared with the fermi observations ,",
    "this value must be corrected for two effects : i ) the spread of the flux due to the psf profile , and ii ) the large optical extinction in the r band .",
    "correcting for all these effects , the optical flux is @xmath46mjy at the peak .",
    "we used the band model parameters obtained by the fermi - gbm @xcite to compute the optical flux expected from the high energy band .",
    "we derived an expected optical flux of 2.6@xmath26jy , which is @xmath27 times the one observed . taking account for the uncertainties in the bhat s alpha parameter",
    "the extrapolated flux is always @xmath28 times the one observed .",
    "the analysis of optical and gamma  ray light curves of grb  081126 reveals : i ) the width of the optical peak is the same as the gamma  ray peaks , ii ) the profile of the optical peak is consistent to the gamma  ray peaks after correcting for the different psf , iii ) the optical peak occurred 8.4@xmath03.9s ( or @xmath25 s ) later than the gamma peak .",
    "this is the first time - lag measured between optical and gamma light curves of a grb .",
    "iv ) the gamma  ray flux measured by gbm fermi , extrapolated to optical energies is @xmath27 times smaller than the optical flux .",
    "these three results provide potentially new constraints on the theory of prompt grb emissions .",
    "for example , time lags between different energy photons are predicted by quantum gravity in the framework of string theory ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". however , in such a case optical photons should arrive before gamma ones . as we observe the opposite , one can rule out this hypothesis for the grb  081126 s optical lag .",
    "gamma - ray photons comptonization on cold electrons could explain the profile of the optical flare .",
    "however , this can not explain the positive lag observed .    within the internal shock framework",
    ", this temporal lag implies that optical photons were emitted after the @xmath2ray ones .",
    "however , it is surprising that the flux _",
    "increases _ so dramatically during this process .",
    "this is not well understood in the standard model for the inelastic internal shock and our results provide new tools for refining the standard model .",
