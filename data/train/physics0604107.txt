    "the triumf weak interaction symmetry test ( twist ) measures momentum and angle distributions of positrons from the decay of highly polarized positive muons , to determine precisely the decay ( `` michel '' @xcite ) parameters .",
    "it uses a solenoidal spectrometer with 2 t magnetic field consisting of 56 planar drift and proportional chambers arranged symmetrically with high precision on either side of a central foil that stops the low energy muon beam @xcite .",
    "the incident polarized muon beam is directed along the axis of the solenoid from the beam line , through the fringe field region , and into the chamber stack within the uniform tracking region . following the decay of the muon , the positron is tracked in the chambers and a high statistics decay distribution",
    "is acquired .",
    "the first results from the experiment have been published @xcite . to extend those results to higher precision , and especially to analyze and",
    "assess systematic uncertainties for the polarization dependent asymmetry decay parameter @xmath0 @xcite , a method was required to measure quickly and reliably the muon beam characteristics near the entrance to the solenoid .",
    "while the twist detector itself , specifically the first several planes of drift chambers , has some excellent properties for this kind of measurement , its placement is disadvantageous .",
    "it is located after materials that contribute to multiple scattering , such as a vacuum window and trigger scintillator .",
    "in addition , the gas density at atmospheric pressure and the extra cathode layers of the first detector chambers add intolerable scattering sources .      the requirements of high polarization and rapidly achieved high statistics are satisfied by a beam of surface muons @xcite produced at the surface of the primary proton target from pion decay at rest . high polarization with respect to the direction of momentum @xmath1 ( @xmath2 , which is exactly @xmath3 if the standard model holds true ) is assured , because the helicity of the muon neutrino determines the spin angular momentum of the recoiling muon .",
    "the resulting muons have momentum of 29.79 mev / c ( 4.12 mev ) and a range of only 0.15  g  @xmath4 in carbon .    for the triumf m13 beam line @xcite , the primary production target is typically graphite of thickness 10 mm . at the momentum of surface muons , there are also other particles in the beam , such as positrons , positive pions , protons , and heavier positive ions . however , the pion decay length is short compared to the channel length , while protons and heavier ions do not penetrate thin material layers , leaving positrons as the major beam contaminant",
    ". they can be readily distinguished from surface muons by a combination of energy loss and time of flight with respect to the 43  ns period of the accelerator .",
    "the time of flight also permits separation of a small component of muons which arise from pion decay in flight .",
    "while the maximum surface muon rate for the beam line is of order @xmath5  s@xmath6 , the twist experiment selects muons to provide a small beam spot , divergence ( see section [ beam_characterization ] ) , and momentum spread .",
    "the muon rate is typically 15  @xmath7  s@xmath6 .",
    "those muons that are created within the primary target , some distance from its surface , will lose energy and undergo multiple scattering prior to escaping into the surrounding vacuum .",
    "some scattering can also occur in any materials in the beam line between the primary target and the twist detector .",
    "scattering reduces the correlation of momentum and spin directions , and thus the polarization , so it is essential to eliminate such materials as much as possible and to select only those muons near the maximum momentum allowed in the decay to keep this depolarization at a level negligible compared to the sensitivity of the twist measurements .",
    "these criteria demand a muon beam line with momentum resolution @xmath8 ( fwhm ) @xcite , with no significant windows , residual gas , or other material in the muons path .",
    "the muons transported to the end of the beam line by magnetic elements will retain the correlation of momentum and spin direction , @xmath2 .",
    "the ensemble polarization of the beam with respect to a beam axis @xmath9 , @xmath10 , will be less than @xmath2 for a beam of finite emittance , but a high and predictable correlation of momentum and spin is retained .    as the muon traverses the beam line , the solenoid fringe field region , and enters the tracking region , the momentum and spin direction retain their correlation ( @xmath2 is preserved ) , but transverse momentum components are added in the fringe field and an apparent depolarization with respect to the solenoid ( and beam ) axis is the result , i.e. , @xmath10 decreases .",
    "this can be modeled quite precisely in simulations , assuming the field shape is known sufficiently well , and also assuming the particle positions and momenta can be determined for some point near the entrance to the field .",
    "a detector to measure muon positions and momentum directions in a surface muon beam has been constructed , using two time expansion chambers ( tecs ) @xcite at low pressure . a low pressure ( 4  40 mbar ) proportional chamber was tested in @xcite .",
    "detailed investigations of low pressure chambers were described in @xcite .",
    "a tec determines the track of an ionizing particle in one dimension , transverse to the particle s direction , via the drift time of ionization in a relatively uniform drift field .",
    "the ionization then reaches a region of higher field where gas amplification takes place near a sense wire anode . because beam characteristics are required for both dimensions ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) transverse to the beam direction ( @xmath13 ) , the twist tec system consists of two orthogonal tec modules .",
    "surface muons are easily scattered , so to minimize multiple scattering effects , the primary design criterion for the twist tec system was to maintain low mass .",
    "the detector must also operate in the vacuum of the muon beam channel , which in this case is not isolated from the primary production target nor from the accelerator itself .",
    "operation of the detector using low pressure dimethyl ether ( dme ) gas allows the use of thin windows that isolate the chamber gas from the beam line vacuum .",
    "dme , having a long drift time , small lorentz angle , and high primary ionization , is convenient because it is also used for twist drift chambers .",
    "an automated control system ensures that this low differential pressure is maintained .",
    "the overall length of the tec system was kept to a minimum compatible with a reasonable track length necessary for an accurate direction measurement .",
    "the beam size can range up to a few centimeters , so a somewhat larger active area was chosen , within which the only materials in the beam path are the entrance and exit windows , the low pressure chamber gas , and very thin field cage wires required to define the drift field .",
    "the device must be capable of recording muon rates up to several thousand per second , while its operation should also not be compromised by a comparable rate of beam positrons .    even though the tec material in the beam path has been minimized , it scatters the beam too much to be used simultaneously during twist s highest precision muon decay polarization measurements .",
    "the total systematic uncertainty grows as the depolarization increases , so the tec system is removed for most muon decay data taking .",
    "instead , it is used periodically to tune and measure characteristics and to verify muon beam stability between beginning and end of data sets taking several days to collect . in this way , possible muon beam changes during the data set collection become evident , which may be correlated to other carefully monitored quantities .",
    "therefore , another important design feature was that the detector can be installed into and removed from the beam line quickly , conveniently , and reproducibly .",
    "the tec system is located directly upstream of the twist spectrometer and is attached to the end of the triumf m13 beam line @xcite as shown in fig .",
    "[ tec_in_beam ] .",
    "the beam passes from the final two quadrupoles through a gate valve and into the low pressure gas containment volume in which the two tec modules operate .",
    "it then continues in vacuum through the fringe field near the yoke end plate until it reaches a vacuum window inside the high field region .",
    "from there , it passes through a variable density gas degrader , a thin trigger scintillator , and into the twist detector .        as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ two_modules ] , the tec system consists of two identical modules rotated 90 degrees with respect to each other and mounted in an aluminum gas box of length 280  mm .",
    "one module tracks the horizontal ( @xmath11 ) position and angle of the incoming muons and the other the corresponding vertical ( @xmath12 ) components .",
    "each module is 80  mm long .",
    "the active area that can be measured by each tec is 60  mm @xmath14 60  mm transverse to the beam , with an active length of 48  mm ( 24  wires spaced by 2  mm ) .",
    "the gas box has 6  @xmath15 m aluminized mylar entrance and exit windows and is nested in a vacuum box .",
    "the pressure is maintained at 80  mbar with a flow of dme gas of approximately 100  @xmath16/min .",
    "the vacuum box is part of the beam line and remains in place , while the tecs , the gas box , and the gas box lid , can be removed and replaced by a blank cover plate .",
    "figure [ threedim_view ] shows an exploded three - dimensional rendering of one tec module .",
    "the sense and grid planes are strung on frames of nominally 1.6 mm thick g-10 ( epoxy / glass ) printed circuit boards ( pcbs ) as are the side walls of the field defining cage .",
    "the drift field plane frames are 3.2 mm thick pcbs .",
    "the remaining structural elements of the module are also manufactured from g-10 .",
    "the connectors have gold plated contacts in a glass - filled polyester matrix .",
    "the module is assembled with nylon cap screws .",
    "all materials have been tested for compatibility with the dme gas @xcite .",
    "each module contains a drift field region and gas amplification region .",
    "the drift field region is bounded by a four sided field defining cage with two side wall elements containing parallel horizontal printed circuit traces and two end ( particle entrance and exit ) field planes with 50 @xmath15 m gold plated cu / be wires strung horizontally across the opening .",
    "the wires of the two end drift field planes are electrically connected to the side wall traces through gold plated pins and a socket assembly .",
    "the pitch of the wires and traces is 2.54 mm . to achieve a uniform electric field , each group of wires and traces is connected to its neighbor through resistors of the same value creating a resistor chain to",
    "which high voltage is applied .",
    "the drift cathode plane on the bottom of the field cage is a copper foil on a 1.6 mm g-10 substrate .",
    "the gas amplification region consists of a grid wire plane , a sense wire plane and a solid cathode plane .",
    "these planes are separated by spacer planes made of 1.6 mm g-10 .",
    "a section of the wire geometry of this configuration is shown in fig .",

    "the sense wires are 25 @xmath15 m gold plated tungsten .",
    "the signals from the 24 sense wires are taken from the end of the printed circuit board through a coaxial cable assembly to a feedthrough in the gas box lid .",
    "when the elements of the drift field region and gas amplification region are mated , the last resistor in the field defining cage is connected to the grid plane , which is maintained at ground potential as is the ground plane on the other side of the sense plane . as shown in fig .",
    "[ sense_plane ] , the sense plane is made up of alternating sense and shield wires .",
    "gas amplification occurs only at the thinner sense wires .",
    "the diameter of 25 @xmath15 m was chosen for these wires based on our previous study of gas gain at low pressure @xcite .",
    "the shield wires screen the induced pulses from adjacent wires and are necessary because the average angle of the muon tracks through the tec module is quite small .",
    "this results in signals on adjacent sense wires occurring at very nearly the same time , so the mutually induced pulses would seriously affect the rise time of these signals and hence the accuracy of the drift time measurement .          it is important to align the tec system accurately with respect to the twist spectrometer and hence with the measured magnetic field map .",
    "cross - hairs were mounted in the apertures at each end of the steel yoke of the spectrometer to define the @xmath13 axis .",
    "an optical surveying instrument ( theodolite ) was then used to align each tec to these cross - hairs .",
    "first the @xmath11 and @xmath12 positions of the tec system were adjusted to align the field cage wires for both @xmath11 and @xmath12 modules , and then the location was checked with the position of the central hole of the calibration collimators ( see sec .",
    "[ extraction_of_str ] ) .",
    "the accuracy was approximately @xmath17250  @xmath15 m . once this alignment was completed another optical device , a leica tda5005 total station , was used to record the position of the tec vacuum box with respect to the m13 beam line and twist spectrometer .    as described previously ,",
    "the tecs , the tec gas box , and the gas box lid , have been designed to be easily removed and replaced .",
    "this is done in a reproducible manner using locating pins in the vacuum box , which remains as part of the beam line vacuum system with a blank cover plate",
    ". however , any time the tec assembly is removed and replaced , a measurement of its position is made with the total station to confirm that proper alignment has been maintained.the accuracy of this measurement is @xmath1750  @xmath15 m .",
    "it was necessary to take precautions to avoid movement due to forces from vacuum loading of the beam line and magnetic fields of the solenoid .",
    "the optimum drift field for the tecs was found to be approximately 16  v / mm , corresponding to an applied drift cathode plane voltage of -1000  v with the grid plane at ground potential ( refer to fig . [ threedim_view ] ) .",
    "the applied sense - wire high voltage is 1150  v and the shield wires are at 300  v. these voltages result in a muon track efficiency of essentially 100% with typically up to 19 out of 24 wires providing measurable ionization signals ( hits ) per muon track ( see [ tracking_resolution ] ) .",
    "there are intermittent sparks , the location and cause of which are still undetermined .",
    "a degradation of efficiency over a period of weeks of operation has also been observed , which may be a result of the sparking .",
    "although the origins of these effects are not yet understood , the practical solution of regular replacement of sense wire planes has been adopted .",
    "the 24 wires of each of the tec modules are connected to 24 channel preamplifiers mounted on the lid of the tec gas box .",
    "the preamplifiers were developed at fermilab for use at their colliding detector facility @xcite .",
    "each channel has a gain of 1 mv / fc and a dynamic range of -400 fc to + 20 fc .",
    "signals are taken via 9.5 m of micro - coaxial cable to custom made post - amplifier / discriminator modules , which have sixteen channels in a single width camac module and are also used in the readout of the twist spectrometer @xcite .",

    "these tdcs are multihit type to allow digitization of up to eight time intervals per channel per readout ( or event ) .",
    "they have 0.5 ns resolution and are operated in common stop mode .",
    "the trigger signal for the tdcs is derived from a plastic scintillator mounted downstream of the tec vacuum box . when the solenoid is in operation , it is the same scintillator that provides the trigger for twist ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ tec_in_beam ] ) ; a dedicated trigger scintillator following a window at the exit of the tec vacuum box is used for tests and tuning with the solenoid magnetic field off .",
    "the tec gas system is required to provide a flow ( typically 100 @xmath16/min ) of dme to the tecs while maintaining a constant pressure ( typically 80 mbar ) in the gas box .",
    "upstream pressure control is accomplished with an absolute pressure transducer that measures the pressure in the tec volume .",
    "this transducer signal is fed to a proportional - integral - differential ( pid ) device controlling the flow through a mass flow controller in the gas supply line to the tecs .",
    "downstream flow control is provided by a manual fifteen - turn metering needle valve in the exhaust line between the tecs and the exhaust pump .",
    "the observed pressure control stability , as reported by the pressure transducer , is approximately @xmath18 .",

    "issues pertaining to tec gas box installation , gas control , and interlock features , are discussed in appendix [ gas_appendix ] .",
    "the field cage is used to produce a uniform drift field for electrons .",
    "ideally , the electric field between the drift cathode plane and the grid plane ( fig .  [ threedim_view ] ) is perpendicular to the planes and constant at @xmath21 v / mm everywhere in the drift volume . in reality , however , the field distribution is distorted by the high voltage applied to the sense plane and also by the stray electric field from the other tec module .",
    "the femlab program @xcite was employed to study such effects . figure  [ sense_eff ] , obtained from the femlab simulation of a single module , shows distributions of the drift fields in the center of the drift volume ( i.e. , at @xmath22 for the x module ) at various settings . compared with the case when the sense plane is off ( open circles ) , the field changes by about 10% over the length of the module when the sense plane is turned on ( open squares ) , which indicates that the grid plane is not completely effective in shielding the drift region from the sense plane potential . a @xmath13 position dependency of the field intensity is clearly seen in both cases .",
    "this edge effect is likely due to the influence of the field cage . in a test with femlab",

    "as described in the previous section , the electric field in the drift region is not uniform .",
    "the drift velocity varies with the drift distance and the @xmath13 position of the sense wire .",
    "a pair of multi - hole apertures , installed 141 mm upstream and downstream with respect to the center of the tec gas box , acts as a collimator and is used as an external reference system to measure the str as a function of various operating parameters .",

    "apertures that cover the entire active region will be used in the future .",
    "simulations with garfield @xcite suggest that the drift time has an almost linear relationship with temperature and therefore gas density ( as illustrated at a field of 16.4 v / mm in fig .",
    "[ temperature_eff ] ) .",
    "data taken at 19.6@xmath41c and 23.0@xmath41c confirm the temperature dependence . because the dme gas pressure is fixed at 80 mbar and the temperature is recorded by the data acquisition system ,",
    "variations of the str with the gas density have been taken into account either by taking the calibration data at the same temperature or by linearly rescaling the str according to the density .          in this paper , we use the word `` event '' to refer to the information which is recorded for each occurrence of a valid trigger .",

    "track candidate signals are identified from all wires having signals ( hits ) within the time window .",

    "the second was a beryllium target of 12 mm length encased in a stainless steel water cooling jacket ; it produced an asymmetric @xmath11 profile some 20% larger than the graphite , thus it is considered inferior for twist muon decay measurements .",
    "when the solenoid was turned on to its full 2 t central field , and the strs from the tec calibrations were verified to be consistent with those derived with the solenoid off , it was observed that the incoming muon beam was steered to positive values of @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",

    "while the solenoid fringe field does not appreciably alter the beam size , the shift of position away from the solenoid axis , believed to be due to the interaction of the solenoid fringe field with beam quadrupoles and the final beam dipole , is a cause for concern .",

    "the corresponding rms widths used for the random numbers at each @xmath50 point are also taken from the tec information .",
    "however , they must be reduced compared to the measured values , to account for the scattering added by the materials of the tecs as the particle passes through ; this is accomplished by a quadratic subtraction , using scattering contributions estimated from comparisons of simulations with and without multiple scattering .",
    "this technique is intended to reproduce the correlations found between the angles , @xmath52 and @xmath54 , and the positions , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "correlations between @xmath52 and @xmath54 have been observed to be very small and are not simulated .",
    "the muon is scattered by the tec gas box entrance window ( @xmath58 radiation lengths ) and by 3.5  cm of dme gas ( @xmath59 radiation lengths ) before it reaches the tec x module , resulting in a smearing of the measured @xmath52 by an estimated 9.5  mrad .",
    "scattering has an even larger influence on the @xmath54 , smearing it by 12.6  mrad , since the muon travels through an additional 12.0  cm of dme ( @xmath60 radiation lengths ) before it reaches the y module .",

    "the tec system has already provided twist with important information about the muon beams used to make precise measurements of muon decay as a test of the standard model . in the future",
    ", we expect to be able to improve the optimization of beam characteristics ( beam size and divergence ) to provide the smallest possible depolarization of the beam as it enters the solenoidal field of the spectrometer",
    ". we will also be able to determine what factors affect the muon beam , and by how much .",
    "this in turn will enable us to minimize systematic effects of the muon decay parameter determinations caused by variations in the muon beam , and also to assess accurately the influence of residual systematics .",
    "finally , data from the tecs will be crucial to a reliable simulation of the muon beam , which in turn will be necessary for the detailed simulation of all aspects of the experiment .",
    "because the extraction of muon decay parameters from data depends on a high precision comparison to the simulation , the success of the experiment ultimately will depend in part on the data supplied by the tecs .",
    "we acknowledge with gratitude the assistance of p. bennett , s. chan , l. ellstrom , b. evans , and m. goyette , as well as the entire twist collaboration , especially r.e mischke for his comments and suggestions .",
    "tec system construction and development was supported by triumf and the national research council of canada .",
    "twist is supported by research grants from the national sciences and engineering research council of canada , by the us doe , and by the russian ministry of science .",
    "in the twist tec system , flammable dme chamber gas is separated from the cyclotron vacuum by aluminized mylar windows of 6 @xmath15 m thickness .",
    "consequently , major design features of the gas system include interlocks and procedures to prevent differential pressure from rupturing the 6 @xmath15 m windows and to avoid flammable mixtures of air and dme in the tecs .",
    "to provide redundancy , an independent bipolar differential pressure transducer is used to monitor continuously the differential pressure across the windows .",
    "a programmable logic controller is used to read the various pressure , flow and other status inputs and implement the interlock logic .",
    "the system has three modes of operation ; tec_out , pump / vent , and normal operation .",
    "the tec_out mode is used when the tec gas box has been removed from the vacuum box . whether or not the tecs are in the vacuum box is detected by a microswitch on the vacuum box mating flange . in this mode ,",
    "all the tec supply and exhaust valves are forced closed , thus isolating the gas system .",
    "high voltage to the tecs is disabled .",
    "the control system s only active functions are to control in a safe way the gate valve separating the tec vacuum box from the beam line , and the valve connecting the vacuum box to its vacuum pump and vent ports , with interlocks based on the pressures reported by vacuum gauges in the tec vacuum box and the beam line .    in the pump / vent mode ,",
    "some valves are forced open , while others are forced closed , such that the tec gas box and all of the connecting supply and exhaust tubing , which can be at sub - atmospheric pressure during normal operation , can be pumped out through a bypass valve connecting the tec gas box to the tec vacuum box .",
    "this ensures that possible air leaks into the tecs or any of the connecting plumbing can be discovered .",
    "the gate valve is forced closed in this mode , isolating the tec vacuum box from the beam line during vent and pump down procedures .",
    "high voltage to the tecs is disabled .",
    "the bypass valve connecting the tec gas box to the vacuum box can be closed to assist in locating leaks .",
    "however , it is forced open if the differential pressure across the windows exceeds a set point limit .",
    "the normal operation mode has the most complex interlock scheme .",
    "the bypass valve and the valve connecting the vacuum box to the vent and vacuum pump ports can not be opened .",
    "the tec high voltages are enabled only if all the valves in the gas supply and exhaust lines are open and the dme flow to the tecs exceeds a set point limit ( typ . 30 cc / min ) .",
    "the gate valve can be open only if the vacuum box and beam line pressures are satisfactory and the differential pressure across the tec gas box windows is below a first set point limit .",
    "the gas system valves in the dme supply and exhaust lines can be open only if the vacuum box pressure is satisfactory , and the differential pressure across the windows is below the first set point limit .",
    "if despite being isolated from the gas system , the magnitude of the differential pressure continues to increase beyond a second , higher set point limit , the bypass valve connecting the tec gas box to the vacuum box is forced open to relieve the pressure across the windows .",
    "this second limit is set at @xmath61 mbar , well below the @xmath62  mbar typically required to rupture the windows ."
