    "the distance measurement using sne ia is based on the assumption that the look - back time evolution of sne ia luminosity , after light - curve shape and color corrections , would be negligible . a strong support for this assumption was the apparent insensitivity of sne ia luminosity with host galaxies of different morphological types , where sne ia are believed to arise from old and young progenitors @xcite .    however , more extensive recent compilations of sne ia data show a systematic difference , in the sense that sne ia in late - type hosts are fainter than those in early - type hosts by 0.16 @xmath3 0.08 mag , both at low and high redshifts @xcite . considering",
    "the fact that the difference in hubble residual ( hr @xmath4 ) used in the discovery of the dark energy is @xmath10.2 mag , this is potentially a significant result and no longer supports the assumption that there is no luminosity evolution of sne ia .",
    "furthermore , recent studies on the host galaxy properties report a systematic difference in hr of 0.08 @xmath3 0.02 mag between the high and low mass host galaxies @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that this difference alone could shift the dark energy equation of state , _ w _",
    ", by 0.17 .",
    "since the mass of a galaxy can not directly affect sn luminosity , this is most likely due to the population properties of a host galaxy , such as age and metallicity @xcite .",
    "all of these results might indicate that the light - curve fitters used by the sne ia community can not quite yet correct for a large portion of the population age or metallicity effects .    in order to investigate these issues more directly",
    ", population age and metallicity of host galaxies are required to be pre - determined .",
    "most of the studies on host galaxy properties , however , use spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting technique or emission lines to measure gas - phase metallicity , star formation rate , and stellar mass @xcite . because of",
    "the well - known limitations of this technique , such as the age - metallicity degeneracy and attenuation by dust , population ages derived from this technique is rather uncertain ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in order to overcome these limitations , balmer absorption lines have been widely used in age dating of early - type galaxies ( etg ) during the last two decades @xcite .",
    "one of the results established from these studies is that stellar population in more massive galaxies , in the mean , is older than that in less massive galaxies .",
    "although there is no theoretical reason to believe that stellar population in host galaxies would be significantly different from that in non - host galaxies , this `` downsizing '' trend is not reported yet from host galaxy studies .    as to the sne ia host galaxies",
    ", there have been only two previous studies that employed this technique based on balmer absorption lines . in their pilot study",
    ", @xcite obtained low signal - to - noise ( s / n = 10 - 20 ) ratio spectra of 29 nearby early - type host galaxies .",
    "their result , however , is hampered by `` an error in the original analysis '' ( see section 1 of * ? ? ?",
    "the other study by @xcite used very low s / n ( @xmath110 ) spectra from sloan digital sky survey , and attempted to obtain population ages from emission corrected absorption lines .",
    "most galaxies in their sample ( @xmath170% ) are emission dominated star - forming or active galactic nuclei ( agn ) galaxies , and thus required significant emission corrections , which together with the low s / n ratio spectra produced rather limited results ( @xmath15 gyr error in age ) .    in order to determine more reliable population ages and metallicities for a sufficiently large sample of early - type host galaxies based on high s",
    "/ n spectra , we have therefore initiated the project that we call yonsei , yonsei nearby supernovae evolution investigation .",
    "for this project , we have constructed our own sne ia catalogue ( y .- l .",
    "kim et al . , in preparation ) by employing mlcs2k2 and salt2 light - curve fitters @xcite implemented in the supernova analysis ( snana ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) package . since etgs are more homogeneous in terms of population age and less affected by dust extinction , we believe that this project can provide the best test for the possible luminosity evolution of sne ia .",
    "furthermore , etgs are known to host both faint and bright sne ia , while late - type galaxies tend to host fainter sne ia , after light - curve corrections @xcite . as the first paper of this series , here we report our spectroscopic observations for 27 nearby host galaxies observed at las campanas observatory ( lco ) .",
    "the spectra obtained from these observations are used to investigate the correlations between population age , metallicity , and velocity dispersion of early - type host galaxies .",
    "our sample galaxies have been observed with the du pont 2.5 m telescope at lco .",
    "all of them are classified as early - type galaxies ( e - s0 ) by nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) or hyperleda database @xcite .",
    "they are in the redshift range of 0.01 @xmath5 z @xmath5 0.06 with the @xmath6 magnitudes between 11 and 18 mag .",
    "we have further limited our sample to host galaxies for which the sn ia light curve analysis is possible by employing the snana package for our future analysis of the correlation between population age and hr .",
    "the whole sample of our target galaxies are listed in table  [ table1 ] and their images together with sn ia position are shown in figure  [ figure1 ] .",
    "the observations were carried out with the boller & chivens long - slit spectrograph during the six observing runs from february 2011 to march 2013 .",
    "table  [ table2 ] lists an instrumental setup of our observations .",
    "as listed in table  [ table1 ] , the single exposure time of each host galaxy was 1200 , 1800 , or 3600 sec , depending on the brightness , and most of target galaxies were observed at least three times . the slit position angle ( pa )",
    "was aligned with the direction of the major axis of each galaxy , except the cases where a bright object is placed in the slit , for which the angle was further tilted to avoid it .",
    "following the usual manner , calibration frames were obtained including dome flats , twilight sky flats , and he - ar arc lamp .",
    "standard stars for flux calibration , radial velocity correction , and telluric feature removal were further observed .",
    "in addition , we observed 70 stars from the lick library @xcite to transform the measured indices to lick / ids standard system .",
    "spectra for 29 non - host early - type galaxies were also obtained for the comparison with previous studies .",
    "the observed spectra were reduced using the iraf in the standard manner .",
    "pre - processing , including overscan , bias subtraction , flat - fielding , and illumination correction , was performed using the ccdred package , and the cosmic rays were removed by the _",
    "lacosmic _ routine of @xcite .",
    "the he - ar lamp exposures were used for the wavelength calibration and distortion correction .",
    "the one dimensional spectra were extracted using @xmath7 routine with an aperture of 3.85 for the stars and within the half - light width for target galaxies .",
    "the half - light width was calculated based on the spectra of each galaxy , which is defined to be the width that includes the half of the total integrated light in johnson @xmath6 band .",
    "these widths determined from our spectra correspond to @xmath11/4 of the effective radii derived from 2mass photometry ( as defined by * ? ? ?",
    "as shown below in figure  [ figure3 ] , however , the adopted aperture size has only little effect ( @xmath85% ) on the measured lick indices .",
    "the @xmath7 task was also used for the sky subtraction and the noise level estimation .",
    "flux calibration and heliocentric velocity correction were then applied to the extracted 1-d spectra .",
    "telluric absorption lines were further removed for the redder than 7000  using iraf @xmath9 task . with fully processed spectra observed in the same observing run for each galaxy , we finally performed median stacking to enhance s / n ratio",
    ". the typical s / n ratio of our target galaxies is @xmath1192 per pixel ( @xmath13  at 5000  ) and even the faintest galaxies in our sample have s / n ratio of more than 72 .",
    "some etgs in our sample show weak emission lines , which are likely caused by agn or residual star formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this contamination , especially in the h@xmath10 region , must be removed before the lick indices are measured from the spectra for these galaxies . for this , we have used the gas and absorption line fitting ( gandalf ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) package based on the penalized pixel - fitting method ( ppxf ; * ? ? ?",
    "the ppxf routine was also used to derive radial velocity and velocity dispersion of each galaxy . in the gandalf package ,",
    "the miles stellar library @xcite was adopted for the template seds , and the reddening map of @xcite was applied for the galactic extinction correction . to estimate the amplitude of embedded emission in the h@xmath10 absorption line ,",
    "the emission in the h@xmath11 was detected first and then the balmer decrement method , adopting h@xmath11/h@xmath10 @xmath1 2.86 @xcite , was employed .",
    "the continuum shape correction required in this method @xcite was applied in the gandalf package as it performs the continuum fitting to the template seds for the whole wavelength coverage of spectra .",
    "the emission line correction was applied only when a / n , the ratio of the line amplitude to the noise of the spectrum , was larger than 2 ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "only three galaxies in our sample , ngc  1819 , 2masx  j1331 ... , and ugc  03787 , required significant emission corrections ( i.e. , negative lick indices before the correction ) . for the remaining galaxies in our sample , the variation in the h@xmath10 index by the emission correction was either negligible or less than 30% . as an example , figure  [ figure2 ] shows the observed spectrum of ngc  4493 , which compares absorption line features before and after the emission correction .    in order to measure lick / ids indices from the emission - cleaned spectra , we employed an idl routine _ lick_ew _ in the @xmath12 package developed by @xcite . in this",
    "routine , the observed spectra were first degraded from the instrumental resolution of observed spectra ( @xmath1 7  / fwhm ) to the original lick / ids resolution . for the galaxy spectra",
    ", we have further applied corrections for the line broadening from velocity dispersion .",
    "this was performed by calculating the correction factor from the best fitting model spectra in the gandalf package before and after the line broadening ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the correction factor for each index was then applied to obtain indices at zero velocity dispersion . out of 25 indices",
    "measured , we adopted h@xmath10 index as an age indicator , and the mean iron index , @xmath13fe@xmath14 @xmath15 ( fe5270 + fe5335)/2 , was used as a metallicity indicator .",
    "the mg@xmath16 index was also used to estimate the alpha - elements enhancement , @xmath17}$ ] .",
    "the index errors were calculated from the equations defined in @xcite . for five galaxies in our sample in the redshift range of 0.04 @xmath8 z @xmath8 0.06 ,",
    "fe5270 and/or fe5335 indices are contaminated by a strong sky emission line 5577  . in these cases ,",
    "fe5270 and/or fe5335 indices were obtained from the best - fit model spectra .",
    "since there are tight correlations between the observed fe indices and those obtained from the best - fit models , the uncertainties in fe indices derived from this procedure are not significantly greater than those for other sample galaxies and are estimated to be @xmath10.21  for fe5270 and @xmath10.16  for fe5335 ( @xmath110% uncertainty in each index ) .",
    "as the last step , the measured indices were transformed to the lick / ids standard system . for this , our observed spectra for the lick / ids standard stars were used to derive small systematic offsets caused by the continuum shape differences .",
    "figure  [ figure4 ] compares indices measured from our observations with those in the lick / ids database , from which we obtained the mean offset for each index and used it for the zero - point correction .",
    "table  [ table3 ] lists the fully - corrected lick indices ( h@xmath10 , fe5270 , fe5335 , and mg@xmath16 ) , together with the measured velocity dispersion ( @xmath18 ) , for our host galaxy sample . after this correction , in figure  [ figure5 ]",
    ", we compare our indices for non - host early - type galaxies with those in previous studies @xcite .",
    "our measurements are generally in good agreements with mean offsets of 0.12 , -0.043 , 0.11 , 0.21  , and 30.8 km / s for h@xmath10 , fe5270 , fe5335 , mg@xmath16 , and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "these differences are comparable to those reported by other investigators , and are probably due to the differences in the adopted aperture size , instrument used , and/or the procedures adopted for the emission correction .",
    "using h@xmath10 , @xmath13fe@xmath14 , and mg@xmath16 indices measured in the lick / ids system , we have determined the luminosity - weighted mean ages , metallicities , and @xmath19}$ ] s for our early - type host galaxy sample .",
    "for this , we have adopted four different sets of evolutionary population synthesis ( eps ) models , the yonsei evolutionary population synthesis ( * ? ? ? * hereafter yeps ) , ( * ? ? ? * hereafter tmb03 ) , ( * ? ? ? * hereafter tmj11 ) , and ( * ? ? ? * hereafter s07 ) .",
    "the yeps model was constructed with the most up - to - date y@xmath20 stellar evolutionary tracks and isochrones @xcite and the line fitting functions from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it includes the detailed effects of horizontal branch ( hb ) morphology and its variation with metallicity , age , and @xmath19}$ ] , and is well - calibrated to the color magnitude diagrams , integrated colors , and absorption indices of globular clusters in the milky way and nearby galaxies @xcite . because of the detailed modeling of hb , yeps is the only model that can match the observed h@xmath10 indices of metal - poor globular clusters in m31 @xcite .",
    "tmb03 model is based on the isochrones of @xcite and @xcite , and they adopt the fitting functions of @xcite for lick indices .",
    "their model provides extensive grids of @xmath19}$ ] from 0.0 to 0.5 .",
    "tmj11 is the flux - calibrated version of tmb03 , and used empirical fitting functions of @xcite .",
    "s07 developed his own fitting functions based on the @xcite library , and exhibits greater sensitivity to metallicity and temperature of stellar populations .",
    "his model adopted padova isochrones @xcite for scaled - solar and alpha - enhanced model . in practice , we used his model extracted from the @xmath12 package @xcite .",
    "figure  [ figure6 ] compares observed @xmath13fe@xmath14 and h@xmath10 indices of our host galaxy sample with the four different model grids constructed at @xmath19}=$ ] 0.3 .    in our determination of population age and metallicity ,",
    "the initial guesses for age and [ fe / h ] ( or [ m / h ] ) were obtained from the @xmath13fe@xmath14-h@xmath10 grid assuming @xmath19}=$ ] 0.3 . from these initial guesses , we found a value for @xmath19}$ ] in the model grid for mg@xmath21 vs. @xmath13fe@xmath14 .",
    "these procedures were iterated until the values of age , [ fe / h ] , and @xmath19}$ ] reached convergence .",
    "the one sigma errors for age and metallicity were estimated from the observed errors in h@xmath10 and @xmath13fe@xmath14 indices .",
    "figure  [ figure7 ] shows two example spectra for relatively old and young host galaxies , where one can see a large difference in the depth of h@xmath10 line between these galaxies .",
    "table  [ table4 ] presents the derived population age , [ m / h ] , and [ fe / h ] together with their errors , for the host galaxies in our sample , obtained from yeps , tmb03 , tmj11 , and s07 models , respectively .",
    "figure  [ figure8 ] shows the correlation between velocity dispersion and population age for our sample of early - type host galaxies , where each panel shows , respectively , ages derived from the four different population synthesis models .",
    "as is clear from this figure , all panels show positive correlations , although the population ages derived from the yeps model are somewhat younger ( by 1 - 3 gyr ) than those derived from other models .",
    "this is most likely due to the differences in the adopted isochrones / evolutionary tracks . in order to estimate the slope and the statistical significance of the correlation",
    ", we performed the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) analysis implemented in the linmix package @xcite . according to this analysis ,",
    "the velocity dispersion is correlated with population age in the form of age @xmath22 , with an @xmath23 2.17 ( see table  [ table5 ] ) .",
    "the posterior possibility distributions in the upper panels of figure  [ figure8 ] show @xmath199.97% probability for the positive slope , corresponding to @xmath13.9@xmath2 .",
    "strong correlations are still maintained ( with @xmath199.76% probability ) even if the youngest galaxy , 2masx  j1331 ... , is excluded from the regression fit . on the other hand , figure  [ figure9 ] shows that the total metallicity , [ m / h ] , has no significant correlation with velocity dispersion ( @xmath181.25% probability , @xmath11.6@xmath2 ) .",
    "similarly , the iron abundance , [ fe / h ] , also shows weak correlation ( @xmath177.30% , @xmath11.3@xmath2 ; see figure  [ figure10 ] ) .",
    "if the most metal poor galaxy , 2masx  j1331 ... , is excluded from the regression fit , the correlations become even weaker for both [ m / h ] and [ fe / h ] ( @xmath170.81% , @xmath11.1@xmath2 ) .",
    "table  [ table5 ] lists the median value of the slope for the correlation between velocity dispersion and population property ( age , [ m / h ] , and [ fe / h ] ) , and table  [ table6 ] lists the probability for the non - zero slope derived from the posterior distribution together with the corresponding @xmath2 value .",
    "we found a tight correlation between velocity dispersion and population age among our sample of early - type host galaxies .",
    "the total metallicity or iron abundance , on the other hand , show no significant correlation with velocity dispersion .",
    "as summarized in table  [ table6 ] , these results are rather insensitive to the choice of population synthesis models .",
    "when the relation between @xmath18 and dynamic mass of @xcite is adopted , our result would suggest that more massive host galaxies ( by a factor of 10 ) are @xmath16.5 gyr older than less massive galaxies .",
    "a similar result ( @xmath15.8 gyr difference ) is obtained , if , instead , the relation between @xmath18 and stellar mass @xcite is employed .",
    "qualitatively , this is consistent with the well - known `` downsizing '' trend observed among non - host galaxies , in both early @xcite and late - type galaxies @xcite .",
    "our result has an important implication on the well - established correlation between host mass and hr of sn ia @xcite . according to these results , sne ia in more massive host galaxies ( by a factor of @xmath110 )",
    "are brighter , after light curve corrections , than those in less massive galaxies by @xmath10.1 mag . combining this with our result on the host mass and population age would imply that the sne ia in older host galaxies ( by 10 gyr ) are @xmath10.16 mag brighter than those in younger hosts . since we found no correlation between host mass and metallicity",
    ", our result therefore suggests that the origin of the host mass and hr correlation is most likely a population age effect . if confirmed by further observations",
    ", this would imply that the luminosity evolution deserves more careful consideration in the sn ia cosmology . in order to explore this more directly",
    ", our future papers will include the light - curve analysis of sne ia for a larger sample of early - type host galaxies , based on which the correlations between the hr and population properties will be investigated .    in the era of the giant telescopes , sufficient sample of early - type host galaxies at high redshift will be accumulated from a similar survey .",
    "then , a unique dark energy test will be possible by combining the early - type host galaxy sample observed in this study with that to be obtained at high redshifts .",
    "since the maximum possible age of stellar populations in galaxies decreases with increasing redshift or look - back time , host galaxies in the same population age bin , for both the nearby and high redshift samples , should be selected for this test in the construction of the hubble diagram .",
    "for this , relatively young galaxies at low redshifts should be compared with relatively old galaxies at high redshifts . as stellar populations in sample galaxies",
    "would have roughly the same age , this test will be entirely free from the possible evolution effect .",
    "furthermore , since only etgs are employed , it will be less affected by dust extinction .",
    "this `` evolution - free and dust - free '' dark energy test would , therefore , provide an unprecedented opportunity in sn ia cosmology .",

    "<S> more directly , we have initiated spectroscopic survey for the early - type host galaxies , for which population age and metallicity can be more reliably determined from the absorption lines . as the first paper of the series , here we present the results from high signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath0100 per pixel ) spectra for 27 nearby host galaxies in the southern hemisphere . for the first time in host galaxy studies , </S>",
    "<S> we find a significant ( @xmath13.9@xmath2 ) correlation between host galaxy mass ( velocity dispersion ) and population age , which is consistent with the `` downsizing '' trend among non - host early - type galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> this result is rather insensitive to the choice of population synthesis models . </S>",
    "<S> since we find no correlation with metallicity , our result suggests that stellar population age is mainly responsible for the relation between host mass and hr . </S>",
