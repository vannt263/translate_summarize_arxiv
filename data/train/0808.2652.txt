    "the purpose of this paper is to present a scheme to produce a lattice fermi gas with about one fermion per site with entropy per particle much lower than what can be achieved today .",
    "our method is based on the principle of entropy _ redistribution _ and the removal of entropy by _",
    "isothermal compression_. it consists of the following steps :    @xmath6 we immerse the lattice fermions in a bec which acts as a heat reservoir .",
    "the fermions are confined in a harmonic trap and a strong optical lattice .",
    "the bosons sees a much weaker trapping lattice than the one that traps for the fermions .",
    "they are confined in a loose trap and cover the entire fermion system .",
    "the traps for bosons and fermions are species specific@xcite so that they can be varied separately .",
    "( see below for discussions of these potentials . )    * ( ii ) * we compress the fermion harmonic trap adiabatically to turn the fermions at the center into a band insulator , which has two fermions per site and essentially zero entropy . during this process",
    ", a substantial amount of the original fermion entropy is pushed into the bosons , while the entire system has little temperature change because of the large heat capacity of the bec compared to the lattice fermions . hence , even though the process is adiabatic for the entire bose - fermi system , it is essentially isothermal as far as the fermions are concerned .    *",
    "( iii ) * after pushing out the fermion entropy into the bec , we remove it by evaporating away the bosons all at once , leaving the remaining fermions to equilibrate . since the band insulator is incompressible , only its density and entropy near the surface",
    "are affected during this process .",
    "this in turn severely limits entropy re - generation during the equilibration process . as a result",
    ", the entropy of the re - thermalized band insulator has a similar ultra - low value as before boson evaporation .    *",
    "( iv ) * we open up the the fermion harmonic trap adiabatically to lower the density of the lattice fermions . in this way",
    ", one can produce a mott insulator or other states with fractional filling with the same ultra - low entropy .    before proceeding ,",
    "we return to discuss the construction of the trapping potentials mentioned in @xmath7 . to have an optical lattice that confines the fermions tightly and the bosons loosely , the energy difference between the ground state ( @xmath8-state ) and the excited state ( @xmath9-state ) of fermions must be smaller than that of the bosons , @xmath10 . in this way",
    ", one can choose a laser with frequency @xmath11 red detuned with respect to both excitation energies , ( @xmath12 ) , such that the detuning for the fermions is smaller than that for the bosons , @xmath13 .",
    "for @xmath14k fermions , its @xmath15 to @xmath16 transition has a wavelength 740@xmath17 , where as the wavelength of the @xmath18 to @xmath19 transition of @xmath20li boson is 671@xmath17 , which satisfies the aforementioned condition .",
    "moreover , the difference between these two excitation energies are large enough so that the detuning @xmath21 and @xmath22 sufficiently large to suppress heating due to spontaneous emission .",
    "condition @xmath23 can therefore be satisfied .",
    "another scheme that makes use of the hyperfine structure of the @xmath9 state of @xmath24rb was pointed out in ref.@xcite . by tuning the laser frequency to 790.01@xmath17 , which is between the two hyperfine states @xmath25 and @xmath26 of @xmath24rb ,",
    "rb bosons sees no lattice because the red detuned lattice due to @xmath25 is cancelled by the blue detuned lattice due to @xmath26 . on the other hand , such laser will generate an attractive potential for @xmath27li and @xmath14k , since its wavelength is longer than those of the @xmath8-@xmath9 transitions of @xmath27li and @xmath14k respectively .    to illustrate our scheme",
    ", we shall first discuss the basic properties of lattice fermions and the important process of entropy - redistribution .",
    "a fermi gas in the lowest band of a ( 3d ) optical lattice is described by the hubbard model @xmath28 where @xmath29 describes hopping of fermions with spin @xmath30 , ( @xmath31 ) between neighbouring sites @xmath32 and @xmath33 , @xmath34 is the tunneling integral , @xmath35 describes the on - site repulsion @xmath36 between spin up and spin down fermions ; @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the creation and number operators of a fermion with spin @xmath30 at site @xmath32 ; @xmath39 is the total fermion number , and @xmath40 is the chemical potential .",
    "the possible states of the fermions are : band insulator @xmath41 , mott insulator @xmath42 , and `` conducting '' state @xmath43 , corresponding to two , one and a non - integer number of fermions per site , respectively .",
    "the mott insulator will develop af order at the neel temperature @xmath44 , while the conducting state is expected to have a superfluid ground state .",
    "the strongly correlated regime emerges when @xmath45 with @xmath46 being the smallest energy scale . at present",
    ", experiments operate in the temperature range @xmath47 for simplicity , we set boltzmann s constant @xmath48 . our goal is to _ perform operations in this high temperature regime so that the fermions will lose a substantial amount of entropy_.    within the temperature range described by eq.([t - regime ] ) , @xmath49 can be treated as a perturbation and @xmath50 is site - diagonal to zeroth order in @xmath34 .",
    "the number occupation at site @xmath32 is then @xmath51 the entropy per site is @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the partition function at site @xmath32 .",

    "can be calculated from eq.([nr ] ) and eq.([sr ] ) using local density approximation ( lda ) by replacing @xmath40 with @xmath58 .",
    "a typical distribution is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath40 and temperature @xmath59 in eq.([nr ] ) and ( [ sr ] ) are determined from the number and entropy constraints , @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the total number of fermions and @xmath8 is the total entropy produced in the convention cooling scheme before the lattice is turned on .",
    "figure 1 shows the following phases : [ @xmath62 , for @xmath63 ; [ @xmath64 for @xmath65 ; [ ( _ vacuum _ ) : @xmath66 for @xmath67 .",
    "there are also two `` conducting '' phases @xmath68 and @xmath69 with non - integer number of fermions per site .",
    "they are @xmath70 , with @xmath71 , and @xmath72 with @xmath73 .",

    "@xmath78 and @xmath79 denote band insulator and mott insulator , respectively .",
    "the regions labeled @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the  conducting \" regions where the fermions have large number fluctuations and are mobile . ]    the @xmath41 region has essentially zero entropy per particle , @xmath82 , since the pair @xmath83 is the only possible configuration at each lattice site . at temperatures",
    "@xmath84 , @xmath42 has spin entropy @xmath85 , since both @xmath86 and @xmath87 , are equally probable . at the same temperature range , @xmath68 has @xmath88 , since the doublet @xmath83 and the single spin states , @xmath86 and @xmath87 are all equally probable . at even higher temperatures , @xmath89 of both @xmath42 and @xmath68",
    "can rise as high as @xmath90 , as the probability of having an empty site increases from zero .",
    "similar situation occurs in @xmath69 .    while the total entropy and other properties of the system can be calculated in the temperature range @xmath57 using eqs.([nr ] ) , ( [ sr ] ) , and ( [ sntotal ] ) , it is useful to understand them using simple estimates .",
    "the total entropy of the system is @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the lattice spacing , and @xmath93 and @xmath94 are the widths of the @xmath68 and @xmath69 regions .",
    "they are given by @xmath95 and @xmath96 , or @xmath97 the quantities @xmath98 and @xmath99 are the average entropy per site in @xmath43 and @xmath42 regions : @xmath100 , and @xmath101 . from eq.([r1r2 ] ) , we also have @xmath102 showing that the @xmath42 region shrinks as @xmath103 increases .",
    "from figure 1 , we see that if we compress the trap _ adiabatically _ ( by increasing @xmath103 ) , the band insulator will grow at the expense of other phases . as a result ,",
    "the mott regions and the  conducting \" regions , and hence all the entropy , are pushed to the surface , as shown in figures 2a and 2b .",
    "since all the entropy in the bulk is squeezed into the surface layer , the entropy density at the surface must rise above its former value to keep the total entropy constant , which means the temperature the system will increase , as shown in figure 2 .",
    "the fact that adiabatic compression causes heating is a consequence of thermodynamics@xcite .    as compression proceeds , it reaches the point where the width of the @xmath42 region becomes so thin that it is of the order of a few lattice spacings .",
    "( see fig.2a and 2b ) .",
    "this occurs at @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the radius of the @xmath41 region related to the total fermion number @xmath61 by @xmath106 . in this case",
    ", we have @xmath107 eq.([sovern ] ) shows that @xmath59 rises as @xmath108 during an adiabatic compression .",
    "if , however , we are able to keep the temperature constant during the compression , the entropy density at the surface will remain at its initial value , ( see figure 2c , 2d ) . as a result",
    ", the total entropy will be reduced by the same amount as the reduction of entropic volume ( i.e. the region that contains entropy ) , which is substantial as the latter changes from a 3d volume to a surface layer .",
    "this can also be seen in eq.([sovern ] ) , where @xmath109 drops as @xmath110 in an isothermal compression .",
    "as isothermal compression continues , the widths of the @xmath43 and @xmath42 regions will shrink down to a lattice spacing @xmath92 , and the entropic surface region will eventually be reduced to a surface of thickness @xmath92 . at this point , lda breaks down . due to thermal fluctuation",
    ", the thickness of this surface layer will remain approximately one lattice spacing , regardless of further increase of the trapping potential .",
    "as long as @xmath59 is above the spin ordering temperature @xmath111 , the entropy per site is still @xmath112 .",
    "this limits the lowest entropy attainable in isothermal compression for @xmath113 to @xmath114 , or @xmath115 where @xmath116 . for @xmath117 @xmath118",
    ", @xmath119 is 0.012 ( 0.007 ) which is 2@xmath120 ( 1@xmath120 ) of the lowest value attainable today .",
    "to keep the fermions at roughly constant temperature , they must be in contact with a heat reservoir .",
    "a bec is an ideal medium for this purpose , for it has a much higher heat capacity than the fermions and can therefore keep the temperature roughly constant . in this section , we shall provide explicit calculations to demonstrate this fact .",
    "our results show that the transfer of entropy between fermions and bosons is accurately described by the simple isothermal compression model in section @xmath121 .",
    "we shall consider a mixture of bec and fermions .",
    "the bec is contained in a harmonic trap @xmath122 with frequency @xmath123 , where @xmath124 is the boson mass , and another trap @xmath125 is used for the fermions .",
    "the fermions are also confined in an optical lattice .",
    "we shall assume these potentials are species specific as described in summary @xmath6 in section @xmath126 , so that @xmath127 can be varied independently of @xmath128 .",
    "this is important because the compression of fermions should not lead to a substantial compression of the bec .",
    "otherwise the temperature of the bec will rise , making it less efficient in absorbing the entropy of the fermions .    to study the entropy transfer between fermions and bosons , we first consider a homogenous bose - fermi system .",
    "in the grand canonical ensemble , the hamiltonian is @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the hubbard hamiltonian eq.([hubbard ] ) with @xmath40 now denoted as @xmath131 .",

    "as the trap frequency is increased from 100hz ( blue ) to 150hz ( purple ) , figs.(2a ) and ( 2b ) show that the mott phase melts away and the entropy density at the center of the conducting layer increases , leading to a rise in temperature .",

    "the corresponding entropy densities are shown in figs .",
    "( 3d ) to ( 3f ) .",
    "as the frequencies @xmath181 of the fermion harmonic trap increases , the edge of the band insulator sharpens and the entropy distribution becomes more and more narrowed , yet the temperature of the system changes very little as the fermion trap is tightened , from @xmath182 to @xmath183 , and to @xmath184 . as a result , the height of the entropy distribution remains roughly constant .",
    "the narrowing of the entropy distribution , however , leads to a rapid drop in the entropy per particle , from 0.691 to 0.184 , to 0.016 , as shown in figs.(3d)-(3f ) . ]    in our numerical calculations , we consider @xmath185 of @xmath14k fermions in a lattice immersed in a bec of @xmath24rb with @xmath186 bosons .",
    "the frequency of the fermion trap is initially set at @xmath187 = 100hz .",
    "the bosons are confined in a loose trap with frequency @xmath188hz , so that it covers the entire fermion system .",
    "we take @xmath189 nm , and @xmath190 . the lattice height is @xmath143 and the fermions have a hubbard interaction @xmath191 , where @xmath192 is the recoil energy . to demonstrate the transfer of entropy from the fermions to the bec , we consider an initial state with initial temperature 60nk , corresponding to the entropy per particle @xmath193 for the fermions .",
    "for these parameters , most of the bulk is already a band insulator , similar to that in figure ( 2a ) and the entropy density is accumulated at the surface .",
    "( see fig.(3a ) ) .    when the fermion trap frequency @xmath194 increases from 100hz to 600hz , we see from figs .",
    "( 3a)-(3c ) that the edge of the band insulator becomes sharper , while the entropy density becomes concentrated at the surface ( fig .",
    "( 3d)-(3f ) ) .",
    "our calculation also show that the fermion entropy @xmath195 decreases whereas the boson entropy @xmath196 increases , while @xmath197 remains much smaller than @xmath198 and @xmath199 during the compression , and the entropy of the entire bose - fermi mixture is a constant .    due to the large heat capacity of the bosons , the overall temperature @xmath59 rises only moderately , from 60nk to 65.6 nk .",
    "this shows that the simple isothermal compression model for the lattice fermions in section @xmath200 is a reasonable approximation of the entropy transfer process between the bosons and the fermions . at @xmath194=600hz ,",
    "the fermion entropy per particle is @xmath201 , which is about @xmath202 of the best estimate achievable with conventional methods .",
    "after transferring the entropy of the fermions to the bec as shown in fig.(3c ) at the temperature @xmath203 and at trap frequency @xmath204hz , we evaporate all the bosons suddenly so as to obtain a pure fermion system . the lattice fermi gas will then relax to its equilibrium state corresponding to the new trap frequency @xmath205 . in this process , entropy will be generated and temperature will rise . however , because the band insulator is incompressible , and because the trap has a larger value of @xmath206 , entropy generation is limited . we find ( in the calculation below ) that the increases in entropy and temperature are about a few percent of their values prior to evaporation .",
    "in other words , the entropy of the band insulator after it reaches equilibrium is essentially the same as that before boson evaporation , i.e. @xmath207",
    ". this will be the entropy inherited by the mott insulator that emerges from the band insulator as one decompresses the trap .",
    "the calculation for the above processes is as follows . immediately after evaporation , the lattice fermi gas has total energy @xmath208 where @xmath209 is the internal energy per site of a _ homogeneous _ lattice fermion with hamiltonian @xmath210 at the temperature range @xmath57 , and @xmath211 @xmath212 are boson and fermion densities prior to boson evaporation , which were calculated from eqs.([nf ] ) and ( [ nb ] ) .",
    "when the system finally relaxes to equilibrium , it will have a different temperature @xmath213 and chemical potential @xmath214 .",
    "the energy of the final system is @xmath215 since energy is conserved in this process , we have @xmath216 .",
    "in addition , the total number of particles is given by @xmath217 .",
    "these two relations uniquely determine the final temperature @xmath213 and chemical potential @xmath218 of the band insulator , from which one can calculate the final entropy . with the parameters we mentioned before , we find that the entropy increase in this process is negligible , only about a few percent of the value before evaporation ; hence our conclusions summarized in section @xmath219 .",
    "we have introduced a method that allows extraction of a substantial fraction of the entropy of a fermi gas in an optical lattice after a strong lattice is switched on . moreover ,",
    "the extraction process is conducted at the temperature regime @xmath220 , much higher than the neel temperature @xmath44 . _ while our method makes explicit use of the band insulator , it is applicable to any system which has an equilibrium phase with a large gap .",
    "_ the idea is to use the gapful phase to push away all the entropy in the bulk into a surrounding bose - einstein condensed gas .",
    "it should also be stressed that although the final stage of our method involves evaporating away the bose - einstein condensed gas , it is different from the usual sympathetic cooling both in purpose and in function .",
    "first , our evaporation must be preceded by the localization of fermion entropy in order to be effective .",
    "second , the purpose of removing the bosons is not to decrease the energy of the system ( as in the usual sympathetic cooling ) , but to remove the entropy it absorbed from the fermions .",
    "a natural question is whether one can efficiently reduce the entropy of a mott phase which is in direct contact with a bec by evaporating on the latter .",
    "the answer is negative , as shown by our calculations .",
    "the reason is that the interactions between bosons and fermions typically have very weak spin dependence .",
    "the removal of bosons therefore has little effect on the spin entropy of the mott phase , which will remain close to its value before boson evaporation , @xmath112 per particle .    finally , we point out that our scheme assumes that it is possible to expand the trap adiabatically to turn a band insulator into a mott insulator .",
    "this implies that the relaxation time for particle re - distribution is sufficiently fast .",
    "since mass transport occurs at the interface between different phases , ( i.e. regions @xmath68 and @xmath69 ) , it will take place within the time scale @xmath221 .",
    "it is therefore helpful to use lattices with sufficiently large tunneling , ( say , around @xmath222 ) , and to reach the large u limit by increasing the interaction using a feshbach resonance@xcite .",

    "<S> the problem of the conventional method is that it can only cool atoms before they are loaded onto an optical lattice . </S>",
    "<S> there is no way to reduce the entropy further once the lattice is switched on . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the lowest entropy attainable today in an optical lattice plus harmonic trap is just the lowest entropy achievable in a harmonic trap alone . in the case of fermi gases , it is @xmath2@xcite , where @xmath3 is the fermi temperature in the trap . for @xmath4 , which is very much the limit today , we have @xmath5 . any strongly correlated states with lower entropy </S>",
