    "over the past ten years there has been an explosion of research papers published in the area of complex networks .",
    "some would argue that this torrent of publications is a continuance of the growing awareness of complexity science whose origin can be traced back to the decade of the 1960s . the present emphasis on scale - free networks and their implications for scientific disciplines from sociology to neurophysiology had its beginnings with the fractal time series analysis of mandelbrot mandelbrot and the scaling parameter method of hurst @xcite .",
    "from this early appreciation for the limitations of normal statistics to explain and/or characterize complex phenomena we have such terms as self - similar , self - affine , scale invariant , fractal , and multi - fractal to capture the non - homogeneous and non - isotropic behavior of statistical variability @xcite . as the mathematical developments became more familiar to a generation of scientists the investigations into the manifestations of these effects in biology , economics , geophysics , hydrology , neurophysiology , sociology and so on steadily increased in number .",
    "first there were a few isolated studies , followed by a steady rate of overlapping investigations , resulting in what is now a tsunami of monographs , technical papers and popular articles .",
    "consequently , even though no universally accepted definition of complexity has emerged , the consensus of scientific opinion has converged on the use of scaling as one signature of complexity .",
    "the scientific investigations into scaling have historically been of two kinds : 1 ) the formal mathematics identifying the properties data sequences must possess in order to scale in well - defined ways along with the techniques to analyze the data and reveal that scaling and 2 ) the application of those techniques to time series measured in complex phenomena . a stochastic process @xmath1 is said to scale if the time - dependence of the random variable is such that @xmath1@xmath2@xmath3@xmath4 with @xmath5 and @xmath6 is a scaling parameter .",
    "statistical methods to detect self - affinity ( scaling ) in time series identify the variable @xmath1 with the integrated time series and not with the time series itself @xmath7 , such that ,    @xmath8    thus , the original time series @xmath9 may be viewed as a sequence of increments of the variable @xmath10 . in this sense many of the data analysis methods are diffusive  in that the variable @xmath10 is the aggregation of fluctuations denoted by the integral ( [ diffusion1 ] ) . since its introduction in the middle 1990s _ detrended fluctuation analysis _",
    "( dfa ) @xcite has become the method of choice for detecting scaling particularly in biomedical time series @xcite .",
    "the motivation for introducing dfa was the presumed applicability of the method to non - stationary time series , particularly those with long - time correlations .",
    "the scaling methods discussed by mandelbrot @xcite and dfa are variance  methods in that they assume the time dependence of the variance of the stochastic variable @xmath11 with scaling parameter @xmath6 is algebraic , namely :    @xmath12    however there are scaling processes such as lvy flights shlesinger for which such relationships are violated because the second moment diverges or lvy walks @xcite for which the second moment is finite and does satisfy a scaling relation similar to ( diffusion2 ) .",
    "the necessity for detecting the proper scaling of lvy processes was one reason behind the development of the _ diffusion entropy analysis _ ( dea ) method @xcite described in section ii .",
    "the evident advantage of the information or diffusion entropy @xmath13 over second moment methods is that the former is always finite , independently of the behavior of the moments of the probability density distribution ( _ pdf _ ) @xmath14 .",
    "the quantity @xmath15 is the probability of finding the trajectory @xmath1 in a infinitesimal neighborhood of @xmath16 at time @xmath17 .",
    "the divergence of the central moments , typical of lvy processes , create difficulties in the numerical determination of the @xmath18 and the associated entropy .",
    "herein we propose a new procedure for determining scaling , the _ probability flux analysis _ ( pfa ) as a general method for scaling detection .",
    "since the pfa uses the cumulative probability instead of the density @xmath14 itself as such it is statistically more efficient than dea .",
    "the cumulative distribution integrates the _ pdf _ and reduces the noise due to the adoption of a statistical ensemble with a finite number of trajectories .",
    "the pfa method is shown to outperform the other methods in the case of lvy processes .",
    "the present paper is structured as follows . in section",
    "defofscaling we introduce scaling for the _ pdf _ @xmath19 which is an extension of the concept of self - affinity .",
    "ordinarily self - affinity is recovered in the algebraic time dependence of a scaling function @xmath20 as we show using the dea method and its numerical implementation .",
    "we introduce the pfa method in section  [ pfamethod ] , and compare its performance with that of dea on computer generated time series in section  [ pfavsde ] and subsequently make the same comparisons with real world data .",
    "finally , we draw some conclusions in section  [ conclusion ] .",

    "the function @xmath23 in the above equation is the scaled density since @xmath24 the relation  ( [ scaling ] ) proposed here is a generalization of the widespread notion of scaling adopted in the literature @xcite , which often corresponds to the particular case @xmath25herein we refer to the validity of the scaling relation  ( [ scaling ] ) together with ( [ algebraicscaling ] ) as the algebraic  scaling condition .",

    "et al_. @xcite as a tool for detecting scaling in time series .",
    "the advantages of using entropy rather than the variance to detect scaling is that entropy provides a more complete description of the stochastic process .",

    "we see from the calculation depicted in figure 1 that both the dea and pfa methods apparently provide reliable estimates of the early time scaling of the stochastic process , even though we have only used the first 25% of the data in the use of pfa .",
    "the slope of the curves in both calculation is @xmath117 , the expected scaling index @xmath110 in ( [ alphamudelta ] ) .",
    "however after two decades the dea curve begins to run out of statistics , whereas the pfa persists for another decade and one - half before it markedly deviates from the theoretical curve .",
    "the detailed divergence between the two calculations is evident in the insert .    in figure 2a",
    "the _ pdf _ is depicted at times @xmath118 and @xmath119 , with the latter vertically displaced for visual clarity . in the vicinity of the first time both the dea and pfa calculations have the same slope as that of theory , whereas in the vicinity of the latter time the dea calculation significantly deviates from the theoretical curve and the pfa calculation does not .",
    "the _ pdf _ at @xmath118 loses its crispness for large values of the variate where the process becomes undersampled and therefore fluctuates significantly from value to value .",
    "on the other hand , the _ pdf _ at @xmath120 is undersampled throughout the domain of the distribution and therefore the weight of successive values of the histogram are quite noisy .",
    "this is what is meant by `` running out of statistics '' in the dea calculation in figure 1 ; there is insufficient statistics to reduce the noise in the histogram .",
    "the dea calculation therefore is more useful at early times where the histogram for the _ pdf _ is more reliable . at latter times",
    "the larger values of the variate become increasingly more important and the histograms becomes increasingly less reliable",
    ". however , this lack of reliability  in the histograms has no apparent influence on the pfa since slope determination with this latter method is done only using those values of the variate below the percentage cut off @xmath66 and not on a faithful reproduction of the _ pdf _ in the entire range of the variate .",
    "another way of comparing the distribution at different times is to examine the survival probabilities .",
    "lvy distributions ( with the exception of the gaussian case @xmath121 have inverse power - law tails with index @xmath122 thus , the corresponding survival probability has an inverse power - law tail with index @xmath112 . in figure 2b , we see that at @xmath118 the slope of the inverse power - law survival probability ( @xmath123 in our case ) coincides with the theoretical curve over multiple decades of variate values .",
    "the extended inverse power - law region of the survival probability is indicative of the quality of the _ pdf _ depicted in figure 2a . on the other hand",
    ", the @xmath119 survival probability does not have a region that coincides with the theoretical inverse power law for any values of the variate .",
    "this lack of scaling is consistent with what is observed from the dea calculation in figure 1 .",
    "the empirical survival probability is not sufficiently robust to detect the scaling in the data at late times .",
    "however the survival probability is statistically robust at the @xmath124 level and thus the pfa method continues to detect the scaling .    to drive home this point",
    "it is useful to examine how the pfa depends on the choice of @xmath66 . in figure 3",
    "we plot the residue of the pfa analysis for four widely spaced values of the fraction @xmath78 using the same computer - generated data of figure 1 and 2 ( a lvy flight index @xmath100@xmath21.@xmath125 ; @xmath105@xmath21.6 ) . the calculation tracking the theoretical slope for the longest time @xmath126 has @xmath127 .",
    "as the `` time '' t increases the number of trajectories @xmath45 available in the ste decreases",
    ". therefore the larger @xmath78 the earlier in time the cumulative ( survival ) probability @xmath128 becomes statistically unreliable .",
    "the divergence of the first and second moments in the lvy flight considered here makes this loss of statistical robustness even more dramatic .",
    "a similar effect will also occur if very small values of @xmath78 , for example , @xmath129 , are adopted .",
    "in fact , although the support of the _ pdf _ is @xmath130,$ ] the left border of the support of its numerical approximation can be several orders of magnitude larger as shown in figure 2      a random walk is a stochastic process @xmath1 where the distance covered by the walker , the value of the variate , in a finite time is limited .",
    "the restriction on the walk is a consequence of the physical relation between taking a step of a given size and the time required to take such a step shlesinger .",
    "hence , at any given time @xmath17 the walk _ pdf _ is bounded and all the moments are finite . a lvy walk has a _ pdf _ between the fastest walkers that is approximately equal , after a transient , to a lvy distribution .",
    "lvy walks can be generated in a number of different ways , for example , using chaotic intermittent maps zumoklafter , or , as we will do herein , using inverse power - law distributed random numbers .",
    "we consider a type of lvy walk called the symmetric velocity model ( svm ) @xcite . in the svm",
    "walk , the velocity of the random walker can only assume two values / states , here taken to be @xmath1311 .",
    "the velocity of the walker remains in a given state for an interval of time of random duration @xmath132 distributed according to the waiting - time distribution density @xmath133 given by the inverse power - law distribution ( [ plaw ] ) with index @xmath134 $ ] . after waiting in a given state for a time @xmath135 ,",
    "that is , traveling at a constant velocity for the specified time interval , a coin is tossed to determine the new value of the velocity ; and a new @xmath135 is extracted from the distribution @xmath133 to determine the duration of this new velocity value .",
    "the pdf of the svm walk at time @xmath17 is bounded between [ @xmath136 and can be approximated ( @xmath137 mean time of @xmath138 by the scaling expression eq.([scaling ] ) with f(y ) being a symmetric lvy stable distribution with shift parameter given by @xmath139 the skewness parameter @xmath140 , lvy index @xmath141 , and by using the scaling function @xmath142 @xcite .",
    "for the numerical implementation of the svm walk , we extract 10@xmath143 random waiting times @xmath132 according to the inverse power - law distribution with index @xmath144 and location parameter @xmath115 .",
    "then we consider the transformation @xmath145 + 1 $ ] where [ . ] is the integer part of the term in brackets .",
    "this transformation creates a sequence of integers \\{@xmath146 , which are inverse power - law distributed with the same index @xmath105 and approximately the same location parameter b of the original sequence . to assign the velocity states we generate a 10@xmath143 long sequence of random coin tosses : \\{@xmath147 .",
    "finally we use the couples @xmath148 to create the sequence @xmath149 of increments ( the velocity of the walker ) of the stochastic variable _ x _ and consequently the sequence @xmath150 , which is processed using the dea algorithm .    in figure 4 the pfa calculations for the four different values of @xmath78",
    "are compared with the dea calculation .",

    "therefore , we limit ourselves to doing the pfa calculations for @xmath158 .",
    "the results depicted in figure 4 indicate that pfa tracks the therortical straight line for an additional decade beyond that of dea .",
    "the results are approximately independent of the particular value of the cut off fraction @xmath78 , although larger values show less wiggly behavior than do smaller ones ; an effect seemingly at odds with those found in the previous case of the lvy flight .",
    "the rationale for this effect is the following .",
    "for the svm lvy walk , @xmath159 for all _ t _ , however for the numerical calculation this is not true and a plot of @xmath160 reveals a fluctuating value .",
    "the fluctuations increase in intensity as the time t increases since the number of trajectories in the ste decreases as @xmath45 , and the _ pdf _ becomes less symmetric .",
    "the cut off location @xmath63 for values of @xmath72 closer to 0.5 , such as 0.6 are more affected by this type of noise than the cut off location for larger values of @xmath78 such as 0.9 .",
    "the overall effect is that although in theory @xmath161 should be more robust than @xmath162 in practice , the latter is `` crisper '' than the former .      in the previous two subsections we compared the results of using the dea and pfa methods to determine the known scaling properties of computer - generated data sets having diverging and finite second moments , respectively .",
    "now we turn our attention to experimental data sets whose unknown scaling properties we wish to determine .",
    "one such data set of both historic and contemporary interest is that of the electroencephalogram ( eeg ) depicting the erratic dynamics of the human brain .",
    "the observed scaling in eeg time series is not as straightforward as observed in other less complex phenomena .",
    "various measures other than the standard deviation and spectrum have been introduced into the study of eeg time series , each one stressing a different physiologic property thought to be important in representing the brain s dynamics .",
    "most recently the dea method has revealed a rather remarkable behavior of the single channel eeg time series .",
    "specifically the failure of the eeg signal to scale : e.g. : hwa et al.@xcite applied dfa to the series of increments of eeg increments and found a bi - scaling regime .",
    "et al_.  @xcite argues that the eeg signal during resting activity can be modeled using a dissipative linear dynamic process @xmath163 , i.e. , an ornstein - uhlenbeck process , with a quasi - periodic driver having a random amplitude and frequency and an additive random force @xmath164 which is a delta correlated gaussian process of strength @xmath165 .",

    "the observed saturation is the results of dissipative linear dynamics while the decaying oscillations are produced by the random periodic forcing : the alpha rhythm which is the well known wave pattern present in eeg under the closed eyes resting condition .",

    "we see how pfa reproduces all the characteristic observed for dea .",
    "note that eeg records are almost symmetric so that the pfa analysis for @xmath78@xmath530.5 is just the mirror image of the one shown , as is the lvy svm walk of the previous section , of the one relative to @xmath78@xmath290.5 .",
    "this also explain why the results are increasingly crispwhen moving from @xmath78@xmath20.6 to @xmath78@xmath20.9 in fig .",

    "the volume preserving transformation for a scaling distributions is , aside from a constant multiplicative factor , the scaling function itself ( pfascaling2 ) .",
    "therefore pfa can be a scaling detection tool .",
    "the power of this method is that the volume preserving transformation is statistically more robust than any method based on a detailed knowledge of the _ pdf _ such as dea .",
    "the pfa with cut off fraction @xmath78 is as statistically robust as the cumulative distribution @xmath65 at level @xmath78 or the survial distribution @xmath169 at level @xmath128 . for a bounded signal with a well - behaved distribution  ( no inverse power law with infinite first or second moment ) such as the eeg data the statistical advantage of the pfa over dea may not be so evident ( fig .  [ figure5 ] ) .",
    "however , as soon as we depart from the realm of well - behaved distributions the statistical advantage of pfa becomes apparent .",
    "for the svm lvy walk the agreement with the theoretical curve is extended by one decade ( fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] ) .",
    "svm lvy walks have bounded _",
    "pdf s _ but a non well - behaved distribution is hidden in this stochastic process : the _ pdf _ of the waiting times ( [ plaw ] ) with index @xmath105@xmath1062,3 [ , which has an infinite variance , and is the reason why a lvy distribution appears in the region between the bounding sites .",
    "the statistical advantage of pfa over dea is even more evident in the case of lvy flights where the _ pdf _ is unbounded with infinite first and second moments . in this latter case , almost two decades",
    "are gained using one method rather than the other ( fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] and [ figure3 ] ) .    aside from scaling detection , the results of fig .",
    "[ figure5 ] relative to the eeg record , where there is no algebraic scaling , shows that pfa can be used to investigate the dynamics of a stochastic process @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , the details of the dynamics generating the signal @xmath1 are somewhat reflected in the volume preserving transformation performed by pfa . from these results",
    "the inescapable conclusion is that the pfa method  is superior to the dea and ought to replace it .",
    "moreover , since we have shown elsewhere @xcite that dea is preferable to detrended fluctuation analysis ( dfa ) , we must further conclude that pfa replace dfa as well .",
