    "in the standard scenario of the inflationary universe , the observed density perturbations are produced by a light inflaton that rolls down its potential .",
    "when inflation ends , the inflaton oscillates about its potential minimum and decays to reheat the universe .",
    "adiabatic density perturbations are generated because the scale - invariant fluctuations of the light inflaton field are different in different patches .",
    "on the other hand , we know that in supersymmetric and superstring theories there is a serious problem called the `` @xmath0-problem '' . without the symmetry that protects the flatness of the inflaton field , a mass of the order of the hubble constant will inevitably appear in the inflaton field , ruining the conventional slow - roll approximation , which has the typical parameter denoted by `` @xmath0 '' . although it may be possible to construct some inflationary scenarios where the flatness of the inflaton potential is protected by symmetry , it is not straightforward to find a situation where the symmetry appears naturally and all the required conditions for inflation are satisfied without any fine - tuning .",
    "thus , we considered an alternative in this paper .",
    "a new inflationary paradigm is developed where the conventional slow - roll picture does not play an essential role either in obtaining a large number of e - foldings nor in generating the curvature perturbations .",
    "if such a new scenario is successful , it will perform even in cases where the inflaton mass is corrected to the order of the hubble constant . to be more precise",
    ", we will consider a scenario where a `` light field '' is not identified with the inflaton .",
    "the most obvious example in this direction would be the curvaton models@xcite . in the curvaton models ,",
    "the origin of the large - scale curvature perturbations in the universe is the late - decay of a massive scalar field that is called the `` curvaton '' .",
    "the curvaton is assumed to be light during a period of cosmological inflation such that it acquires scale - invariant fluctuations with the required spectrum .",
    "then , after inflation , the curvaton starts to oscillate within a radiation background .",
    "the energy density of the curvaton experiences a growth pattern during this period .",
    "the density of the curvaton finally becomes the dominant part of the total density of the universe , accounting for the cosmological curvature perturbations when it decays .",
    "the curvaton paradigm has attracted quite a bit of attention because it was thought to have obvious advantages .",
    "for example , since the curvaton is independent of the inflaton field , there was a hope@xcite that the curvaton scenario , especially in models with a low inflationary scale , could cure serious fine - tunings of the inflation models .",
    "however , lyth suggested in his paper@xcite that there is a strong bound for the hubble parameter during inflation .",
    "the bound obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite was a critical parameter in the inflationary model with a low inflation scale .",
    "it was later suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite that the difficulty could be avoided if an additional inflationary expansion or a phase transition was present .",
    "more recently , it has been suggested by lyth@xcite that density perturbations can be generated `` at the end of inflation '' by the number of e - folding fluctuations @xmath1 induced by a light scalar field .",
    "this novel mechanism is quite simple but very useful .",
    "one does not have to put severe conditions on the inflaton field , because the generation of the curvature perturbations is now due to the fluctuations of a light field , which is independent of the details of the inflaton dynamic details .",
    "the new mechanism is similar to the curvaton models on this point .",
    "however , there is an important advantage in the new mechanism ; unlike the curvatons , one does not have to worry about the serious conditions that come from the requirement of the successful late - time dominance and reheating .",

    "the condition considered in ref .",
    "@xcite is very common in brane inflationary models when extra dimensions are added .",
    "the benefit of the model is that concern over symmetry is not warranted , as the potential along the equipotential surface is flat by definition .",
    "we also considered a brane inflationary model where a light field appears `` at a distance '' from the moving brane .",
    "this idea fits in well with the generic requirements of the kklt model . to be more precise",
    ", we demonstrated that the conventional @xmath0-problem related to the inflationary brane position is not a serious problem if there is a symmetry enhancement `` at the tip '' of the throat .",
    "this scenario is very natural in the brane universe .",
    "although the generation of the density perturbations was successful in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is still ambiguous if one can achieve a large number of e - foldings without using the usual slow - roll approximations .",
    "dangerous relics in this type of model should also be examined , since the isometry at the tip makes the kaluza - klein mode with the angular momentum very sustainable .",
    "considering the above conditions , we studied a new paradigm of brane inflation , which is not restricted by the conventional slow - roll conditions nor by the curvaton conditions .",
    "we will show that our settings are very natural in the brane universe and can successfully generate the required number of e - foldings , curvature perturbations and relic densities .",
    "we will consider a model where thermal inflation is followed by fast - roll inflation . in this model ,",
    "the hybrid - type potential plays a critical role in both inflationary epochs .",
    "a moving brane is attracted to a distant brane during thermal inflation , and is subsequently detached at a low temperature .",
    "the moving brane rolls down the potential toward the point where inflation ends with a brane collision .",
    "although thermal inflation is not essential in generating the curvature perturbations , it fixes the initial conditions and supports the succeeding stage of the fast - roll@xcite or dbi@xcite inflation .",
    "unlike the conventional scenario of thermal inflation followed by fast - roll inflation , where massless modes play a significant role to generate the unwanted peaks in the spectrum , no such massless modes appear in our scenario .",
    "we will further discuss this point in sect.[thermal - section ] .    in our scenario",
    ", it is better to lower the scale of inflation so that one can obtain a large number of e - foldings . by using the idea of fast - roll inflation .",
    "alternatively , one may use the idea of dbi inflatio@xcite to obtain a large enough number of e - foldings . in the latter case , however , `` slow - roll '' parameters appear in the theory .",

    "a field ( flaton ) can develop a large vacuum expectation value @xmath2 even though its mass @xmath3 is very small .",

    "the number of e - foldings is given by the two hierarchical scales @xmath2 and @xmath3 , @xmath11    the above idea of thermal inflation can be applied to the brane inflationary models , since at high temperatures the points of the enhanced gauge symmetries will be the local free energy minima , and the four - dimensional gauge dynamics can be reconstructed using brane dynamics . in ref .",
    "@xcite dvali argued that considering the coincident branes corresponding to the enhanced gauge symmetry points one might expect that branes are stabilized on top of each other .",
    "for the observer living in the effective four - dimensional universe , the situation looks quite the same as the conventional thermal inflation condition .",
    "a different approach in this direction is given in ref .",
    "@xcite , where thermal inflation is achieved with a hybrid - type potential .",
    "the thermal inflationary models with the hybrid - type potential are first discussed in the conventional four - dimensional theory , and then applied to the brane universe@xcite .",
    "the most obvious advantage in using the hybrid potential is ( 1 ) the enhanced number of e - foldings and ( 2 ) easy reheating .",

    "paper , thermal inflation with the hybrid - type potential is more natural in the brane universe .",

    "however , it is still not clear if such an inflationary model can generate the required number of e - foldings and curvature perturbations without producing unwanted relics . in this section , we consider the inflationary expansion of the model and calculate the number of e - foldings .",
    "a typical example is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : thermal ] , where there is an extra dimension denoted by @xmath14 , and a 3-brane sitting at @xmath15 moving in this direction toward @xmath16 due to a potential that can be generated when supersymmetry is broken .",

    "one may think that the fixed branes are the boundaries of the @xmath14 direction , or they are sitting at the fixed points of a moduli space .",
    "the fixed branes may be 7-branes wrapping some four - cycle of the compactified space other than @xmath14 .",
    "we need to introduce at least one `` anti''-brane sitting at @xmath16 , which is required to produce a hybrid - type inflation followed by brane annihilation .",
    "it is assumed that initially the temperature is so high that the thermal effects on the branes are so strong that they attract the moving brane to the fixed brane at @xmath15 .",
    "as the temperature drops during thermal inflation , the attractive force becomes weaker , and finally the force becomes so weak that the moving brane rolls down the potential toward the `` anti''-brane sitting at @xmath16 .",
    "reheating is induced by the brane - antibrane annihilation at @xmath16 .    to understand the characteristics of the model",
    ", we should first examine the effect of the potential that induces the brane motion .",
    "since we are not considering slow - roll inflation , we must assume that the potential is lifted at least by the @xmath17 mass term , @xmath18 .",
    "the generic form of the potential at a high temperature is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a real scalar field which parameterizes the position of the moving brane , and @xmath21 is a constant . here",
    "we set the field @xmath22 such that thermal inflation occurs at @xmath23 and annihilation occurs at @xmath24 .",
    "we introduced a new parameter @xmath25 because the minimum of the potential might be shifted from either @xmath23 or @xmath26 .",
    "we have assumed that the brane - antibrane attractive force is negligible as far as the separation is significant .",
    "we will also assume ( for simplicity ) that the potential is a monotonic function in the interval @xmath27 .",
    "here @xmath2 is the typical mass scale of the inflating brane .",
    "it is easy to calculate the minimum of the potential at a temperature @xmath28 , which is given by @xmath29 the thermal excitation of the gauge field is significant as long as the temperature is much higher than @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is a gauge coupling constant . on the other hand , at a temperature lower than @xmath8 there is no significant thermal excitation , and thus the attractive force can not keep the moving brane at the right - hand - side boundary .",
    "here we would like to assume @xmath32 for simplicity .",
    "in the brane picture , the gauge field corresponds to the open string stretched between branes . assuming a modest condition @xmath33",

    "the brane separation @xmath37 becomes significant before such massless excitations appear .",
    "therefore , the effective mass of the inflaton @xmath38 can not become much smaller than the hubble constant @xmath39 even if the original mass term appears with a negative sign .",
    "moreover , unlike the non - hybrid type of the thermal inflationary model , we can use a positive mass term for the field @xmath22 , which can not be canceled by the thermal mass term . introducing new constants @xmath40 and @xmath41 , we obtained the number of e - foldings during thermal inflation as @xmath42      after thermal inflation the motion of the moving brane is determined by the @xmath43 mass term .",

    "we will examine this problem in the following section .",
    "since the slow - roll potential is not the essential requirement in this paper , it should be explained how one could obtain the required spectrum of the curvature perturbations without using the usual mechanism .",
    "it is well understood that adiabatic perturbations produced at later stages of the fast - roll inflation have a much smaller amplitude ( and a very steep red spectrum ) , thus they can not lead to desirable consequences . besides adiabatic perturbations",
    ", fast - roll inflation may produce isocurvature fluctuations with a flat spectrum related to the perturbations of light fields other than the inflaton field .",
    "such perturbations may be converted to adiabatic ones if the light field plays the role of the curvaton , or it plays the essential role in the lyth s mechanism of generating the curvature perturbations at the end of inflation . in our case , since it was assumed that thermal inflation occurs prior to fast - roll inflation , the required mechanism for generating the adiabatic perturbations must be consistent also with thermal inflation .",
    "since the vacuum energy is almost static during thermal inflation , thermal inflation produces isocurvature perturbations with a flat spectrum related to the perturbations of light fields if they ( the light fields ) are protected by a symmetry and are `` not '' thermalized during thermal inflation .",
    "let us consider a specific example .",
    "here we consider a light field placed at the tip of the inflationary throat .",
    "the light field is decoupled from the thermal plasma on the distant brane in the bulk , and is very light due to the approximate isometries at the tip of the ks throat . as we will discuss in sect.[kk - string ] , the approximate isometries will make the kaluza - klein modes with the angular momentum dangerously long - lived .",

    "it is also possible to consider a thermal inflationary model where @xmath61(@xmath62 ) @xmath57-branes are attracted to a fixed brane .",
    "when one considers brane inflation , one may simply assume that the typical inflaton field that determines the brane motion is the only field that parameterizes the brane distance between the moving brane and the waiting anti - brane .",
    "this idea is not completely incorrect , but requires further consideration .",
    "for example , let us consider two inflaton fields ( i.e. two directions in the extra dimensions ) @xmath63 with a hybrid - type potential @xmath64 where @xmath65 @xmath66 and @xmath45 are taken to be real scalar fields .",

    "based on the sensible idea advocated recently in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have found a new brane inflation paradigm .",
    "we examined the conditions for constructing a large enough number of e - foldings and for generating the curvature perturbations .",
    "we also examined whether dangerous unwanted relics could be produced .",
    "benefits of our scenario are obvious : we do not have to be concerned about the famous @xmath0-problem if an isometry appears in the structure of the compactified space .",
    "the most useful isometry example is the one appearing at the ks throat , which is , of course , a natural candidate for the `` realistic '' brane universe .",
    "we wish to thank k.shima for encouragement , and our colleagues at tokyo university for their kind hospitality .",
    "our scenario is based on the simple idea that ( 1 ) thermal brane inflation is generically supposed to occur after primary inflation and ( 2 ) there could be some inflationary stage after thermal brane inflation , which is sometimes called by the name `` shoulder inflation '' .",
    "hence generically one should consider three different kinds of inflation if the inflationary model contains thermal inflation .",
    "however , such shoulder inflation has been supposed to be very short or simply disregarded , because of the serious problem related to the overproduction of pbhs .",
    "the pbh overproduction puts a severe bound on models with conventional shoulder inflation@xcite .",
    "one of the important advantages in our scenario is that this condition does not apply to brane inflation models in which the potential is not the rigorous function of the brane distance . of course",
    ", if the broken isometry of the internal space is simply due to the existence of the other brane , the potential that lifts the flat direction related to the isometry must be a rigorous function of the brane distance .",
    "on the other hand , if the isometry is explicitly broken due to the non - trivial structure of the compactified space , for example by the existence of fluxes or warping , the potential for the brane position could be a function determined by the structure of the compactified space . in this case , the potential for the brane position is not a rigorous function of the brane distance . using a simple inflationary model in which thermal brane inflation occurs at a boundary ( or at a fixed brane ) in the @xmath14 direction",
    ", we showed that the serious bound related to the unwanted pbh production can be avoided if the potential for the moving brane is not the rigorous function of the brane distance .",
    "the boundary in the @xmath14 direction is the thermal attractor during thermal inflation , and a `` shift '' from the thermal attractor grows during thermal inflation .",
    "this `` shift '' induces the desired mass for the unwanted massless mode , and reduces the overproduction of unwanted pbhs .",
    "it would be important to note again that in our analysis the potential is not the rigorous function of the brane distance .",
    "this is what happens in generic models with warped internal space , or moduli stabilization by the fluxes@xcite .",
    "the idea that the potential for the brane position is not the rigorous function of the brane distance plays the most important role in our analysis of generating the curvature perturbation at the end of inflation . in our present model the potential for @xmath72 and @xmath71 should not be the rigorous function of the brane distance that is given by @xmath106 .",
    "the difference between @xmath78 and @xmath107 can not be justified if the potential is the rigorous function of the brane distance . in order to make @xmath73",
    ", we have assumed that the light field @xmath71 is related to some enhanced angular isometry of the compactified space .",
    "this is a typical situation in the ks - throat where angular isometries are enhanced at the tip of the throat@xcite and what happens in the potential eq .",
    "( [ 3 - 1 ] ) for large @xmath106 .",
    "on the other hand , the end - line of the hybrid inflation is determined by the brane distance @xmath106 if the brane - brane interaction triggers the end of inflation .",
    "we think some comments are required to explain the origin of the enhanced isometries in the ks throat .",
    "consider the ds background of kklt@xcite .",
    "the idea is that the stabilization of the khler modulus leads to a vacuum with a negative cosmological constant , however the vacuum can be lifted by adding an @xmath108-brane that sits at the tip of the throat . introducing an @xmath108-brane to the warped background one will find new moduli that corresponds to the position of the @xmath108-brane on the compact space .",
    "the potential for the moduli in the kklt background is not trivial .",
    "the @xmath108-brane is not free to move in the throat direction since they have a potential proportional to the warp factor which stabilizes the @xmath108-brane at the tip of the throat .",
    "although the throat direction is stabilized by the potential , the @xmath108-brane can still move on the @xmath109 at the tip of the throat . in the exact ks solution",
    ", @xmath109 at the tip of the throat is exact .",
    "the symmetry of @xmath109 is broken by placing the @xmath108-brane as @xmath110 , which gives rise to three massless moduli .",
    "the moduli correspond to the three coordinates of the position of the @xmath108-brane on the @xmath109 . besides the corrections in the ir - boundary which is expected to be small",
    ", there would be another correction from the uv - boundary .",
    "generically the uv - boundary is supposed to be the calabi - yau manifold where the background deviates from the original ks solution away from the tip .",
    "the corrections from the uv - boundary may explicitly break the @xmath111 symmetry generating masses for the moduli .",
    "although the deformation of the theory generates @xmath43 mass for the moduli at the uv - side , the contribution is exponentially smaller than the typical mass scale at the tip .",
    "therefore , in a brane inflationary scenario where the @xmath108-brane is fixed at the tip of the throat while the moving brane comes from the root , the fluctuation of the @xmath108-brane in the direction of @xmath109 is important although the fluctuation is negligible for the moving brane at the uv - side .",
    "the target brane fluctuates in the direction of @xmath109 but the moving brane does not fluctuate .",
    "angular isometry may appear in other string models , which may or may not protect the mass of the light field @xmath71 .",
    "here we would like to explain more for the three inflationary stages ; primary inflation , thermal inflation and shoulder inflation . in order to induce thermal brane inflation after the primary inflation",
    ", there should be a moving brane that feels the thermal attractive force from the fixed brane(or the boundary ) .",
    "the required situation is also explained in the original paper@xcite , however one might think the conditions are artificial .",
    "we think the most artificial point is the existence of a moving brane , which is supposed to appear not at the stable point of the potential but at the unstable point near the boundary , and then sticks to the boundary due to the thermal attractive force .",
    "of course it is possible to assume that the boundary is the quasi - stable point during the primary inflation , since there could be corrections of @xmath43 during primary inflation which might give large positive mass to the open string mode .",
    "this is the common ambiguity that exists whenever one considers thermal brane inflation .",
    "this is the weak point of our argument .",
    "another thing that we believe to be explained more is the origin of the large - scale fluctuation of @xmath71",
    ". one might think that @xmath83 must be generated during the last ( shoulder ) inflationary period since the curvature perturbation is generated at the end of this period .",
    "this is not the case in lyth s scenario for generating the curvature perturbation at the end of inflation@xcite . since the curvature perturbation depends on the fluctuation @xmath1 , where @xmath61 is the total number of e - foldings elapsed after horizon exit , the large - scale fluctuation of the light field @xmath71 must be generated at the initial few e - foldings of @xmath61 .",
    "hence , the required large - scale fluctuation of the light field @xmath71 should be generated during the preceding inflationary periods , if the last ( shoulder ) inflationary expansion is not enough .",
    "we would like to consider the natural range of the number of e - foldings related to the last ( shoulder ) inflation .",
    "if one excludes `` small '' mass @xmath112 , the upper limit for the number of the e - foldings elapsed during shoulder inflation is given by eq.([shoulder_n ] ) , where @xmath113 for @xmath114 .",
    "this `` minimum '' value for the inflaton mass @xmath115 leads to the `` maximum '' value for the number of the e - foldings @xmath116 , which is obviously large . on the other hand , for the inflaton mass @xmath117 the factor @xmath47 is enhanced up to @xmath118 and it seems unlikely to have @xmath119 without considering additional thermal or primary inflation .    1 r. allahverdi , k. enqvist , j. garcia - bellido and a. mazumdar , gauge invariant mssm inflaton [ hep - ph/0605035 ] ; r. allahverdi , a. kusenko and a. mazumdar , _ a - term inflation and the smallness of neutrino masses_[hep - ph/0608138 ] .",
