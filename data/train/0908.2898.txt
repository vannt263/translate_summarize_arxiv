    "it was already in the 60 s when the pioneering works of higgs , kibble , englert and others suggested the existence of a fundamental spinless building - block of nature , whose non - vanishing vacuum expectation value could explain the spontaneous breaking of the @xmath13 gauge group of the electroweak ( ew ) interactions down to the @xmath14 abelian symmetry group of the electromagnetism . indeed , this so - called higgs mechanism is the most fundamental longstanding issue that remains experimentally unsettled in particle physics .",
    "for one thing it is the only known strategy capable of building up a ( perturbative ) renormalizable quantum field theoretical description of the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) phenomenon .",
    "it is difficult to overemphasize that , to a great extent , the higgs mechanism embodies the backbone of the sm structure and that in its absence we would have to cope with an entirely different conception of the inner functioning of the sm as a quantum field theory ( qft ) .",
    "the central assumption here is the existence of ( at least ) one elementary spinless field ",
    "the so - called higgs boson .",
    "its relevance is particularly evident if we take into account that the presence of one or more such fields in the structure of the model is indispensable for the unitarity of the theory .",
    "if no higgs bosons exist below the tev scale , weak interactions would actually become strong at that scale and e.g. the @xmath15 cross - section would violate the unitarity of the scattering matrix .",
    "moreover , in the absence of higgs bosons the various particle masses could not be generated consistently ( i.e. without spoiling the ultraviolet behavior of the theory at higher orders of perturbation theory ) . in short ,",
    "if no higgs bosons are there to protect the ( presumed ) perturbative structure of the weak interactions , the latter would enter a perilous runaway regime at high energies .",
    "it is , thus , essential to confirm experimentally the existence of one or more higgs boson particles through their explicit production in the colliders .    amazingly enough ,",
    "more than 40 years after the higgs mechanism was naturally blended into the conventionally accepted sm landscape of the strong and electroweak interactions@xcite , it remains still thickly curtained and no direct evidence has been found yet of its main testable prediction : the existence of fundamental spinless particles . notwithstanding",
    "the many efforts devoted at lep and at the tevatron in the last decades , all experimental searches for higgs boson signatures have come up empty - handed , and one has to admit that no conclusive physical signature for the existence of these elementary scalar fields  not even the single one predicted by the sm  has been found for the time being .",
    "thus , we do not know whether the conventional higgs boson exists at all , or if there are no higgs particles of any sort .",
    "on the contrary , it could be that there are extensions of the sm spanning a richer and elusive spectrum of higgs bosons which have escaped all our dedicated experimental searches .",
    "be that as it may , this pressing and highly intriguing enigma will hopefully be unveiled soon , specially with the advent of the new generation of supercolliders , like the brand new lhc , the future international linear collider ( ilc)@xcite and , hopefully , the compact linear collider ( clic ) too@xcite .",
    "therefore , we have to ( and we can ) be well prepared to recognize all kind of hints from higgs boson physics .",
    "let us recall that apart from the single neutral ( @xmath16-even ) higgs boson @xmath17 of the sm , other opportunities arise in model building that could serve equally well the aforementioned purposes .",
    "perhaps the most paradigmatic extension of the sm is the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm)@xcite , whose higgs sector involves two doublets of complex scalar fields .",
    "the physical spectrum consists of two charged states , @xmath18 , two neutral @xmath16-even states @xmath19 ( with masses conventionally chosen as @xmath20 ) and one @xmath16-odd state @xmath21 .",
    "we shall not dwell here on the why s and wherefores of supersymmetry ( susy ) as a most sought - after realization of physics beyond the sm .",
    "it suffices to say that it provides a higgs sector which is stable ( to all orders in perturbation theory ) under embedding of the low - energy structure into a grand unified theory , and in particular it provides the most natural link with gravity@xcite .",
    "but , how to test the structure of the higgs sector ? in the mssm case , such structure is highly constrained by the underlying supersymmetry .",
    "a consequence of it , which is particularly relevant for our considerations , is the fact that the self - interactions of the susy higgs bosons turn out to be largely immaterial from the phenomenological point of view , in the sense that they can not be enhanced ( at the tree - level ) as compared to the ordinary gauge interactions and , therefore , can not provide outstanding signatures of physics beyond the sm .",
    "the bulk of the enhancing capabilities of the mssm lagrangian is concentrated , instead , in the rich structure of yukawa - like couplings between higgs bosons and quarks or between higgs boson and squarks , or even between squarks and chargino - neutralinos , as it was shown long ago in plentiful phenomenological scenarios involving quantum effects on the gauge boson masses and gauge boson and top quark widths , as well as in many other processes and observables ( see e.g. @xcite . for the present state of the art , cf .",
    "@xcite ; and for recent comprehensive reviews , see @xcite , for example .",
    "the two - higgs @xmath22-doublet structure of the higgs sector in the mssm is a trademark prediction of susy invariance .",
    "nonetheless , the very same doublet structure can appear in the form of a non - supersymmetric framework , the so - called general ( unconstrained ) two - higgs - doublet model(2hdm ) , which does also entail a rich phenomenology .",
    "again , the same spectrum of @xmath16-even ( @xmath19 ) and @xmath16-odd ( @xmath21 ) scalar fields arise .",
    "however , we should keep in mind that the most distinctive aspects of the general 2hdm higgs bosons could well be located in sectors of the model quite different from the mssm case@xcite . indeed , even the very couplings involved in the structure of the higgs potential ( viz .",
    "the so - called trilinear and quartic higgs boson self - interactions ) could be the most significant ones as far as the phenomenological implications are concerned , rather than just the enhanced yukawa couplings with the heavy quarks . in such circumstance",
    ", we should be able to detect a very different kind of experimental signatures .",
    "assuming , for instance , that the lhc will find evidence of a neutral higgs boson , a critical issue will be to discern whether the newcomer is compatible with the sm or any of its extensions and , in the latter case , to which of these extensions it most likely belongs . in order to carry out this `` finer '' hunting of the higgs boson(s )",
    ", a @xmath23-range accessible linear collider machine ( such as the aforesaid ilc / clic ) will be needed . in this work",
    ", we will show how useful it could be such collider to discriminate neutral supersymmetric higgs bosons from generic ( non - susy ) 2hdm ones .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we remind the reader of some relevant higgs boson production processes in the linear colliders . in section  [ sec:2hdm ]",
    ", we describe the structure of the 2hdm and the relevant phenomenological restrictions , including the properties of the trilinear higgs self - interactions and their interplay with the notion of unitarity and vacuum stability . in section  [ sec :",
    "renorm ] , we develop in detail the renormalization program for the higgs sector of the general 2hdm . the theoretical setup for the one - loop computation of the higgs boson cross - sections is elaborated in section  [ sec : general ] , leaving section  [ sec : results ] to present a comprehensive numerical analysis of our results .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : conclusions ] is devoted to a thorough general discussion and to present the conclusions of our work .",
    "the leading higgs boson production mechanisms at the lhc have been studied thoroughly for the last twenty years , they are well under control both in the sm@xcite and in the mssm@xcite and there are also some studies in the 2hdm@xcite .",
    "hopefully , they may soon help revealing some clues on higgs boson physics at the lhc  for a review see e.g.@xcite and references therein . however , it is not obvious that it will be possible to easily disentangle the nature of the potentially produced higgs boson(s ) .",
    "the next generation of tev - class linear colliders ( based on both @xmath24 and @xmath25 collisions ) , such as the ilc and the clic projects @xcite , will be of paramount importance in finally settling the experimental basis of the `` higgs issue '' as the most fundamental theoretical construct of the sm of electroweak interactions .",
    "thanks to its extremely clean environment ( in contrast to the large qcd background inherent to a hadronic machine such as the lhc ) , a linear collider ( _ linac _ for short ) should allow for a precise measurement of the higgs boson parameters , such as : i ) the higgs boson mass ( or masses , if more than one ) ; ii ) the couplings of the higgs bosons to quarks , leptons and gauge bosons ; iii ) the higgs boson self - couplings mentioned above , i.e. the trilinear ( 3h ) and quartic ( 4h ) higgs boson self - interactions . at the end of the day",
    ", a linac should allow us to dig deeper than ever into the structure of the ewsb and , hopefully , even to reconstruct the higgs potential itself .",
    "a detailed road map of predictions for higgs - boson observables at the linear colliders is called for , with a special emphasis on those signatures which may be characteristic of the different extensions of the sm .",
    "for example , as indicated above , triple higgs boson self - interactions ( 3h ) may play a cardinal role in this endeavor because , in favorable circumstances , they could easily distinguish between the mssm and the general 2hdm higgs sectors .",
    "such 3h couplings can mediate a plethora of interesting processes .",
    "the key point here is the potentially large enhancements that the 3h couplings may accommodate in the general 2hdm case , in contrast to the supersymmetric extensions .",
    "actually , even for the susy case there is a large number of works attempting to extract vestiges of non - standard dynamics in these couplings , mainly through the radiative corrections that they can undergo .",
    "for instance , the 3h - couplings have been investigated in @xcite , and in some cases considered for possible phenomenological applications in tev - class linear colliders through the double - higgs strahlung process @xmath26 or the double - higgs @xmath27-fusion mechanism @xmath28 .",
    "these processes , which include vertices like @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , are possible both in the sm and its extensions , such as the mssm and the general 2hdm .",
    "unfortunately , the cross - section turns out to be rather small both in the sm and in the mssm , being of order @xmath34 pb at most , i.e. equal or less than @xmath35 fb @xcite .",
    "even worse is the situation regarding the triple higgs boson production in the mssm , in which  except in the case of some particular resonant configuration  the typical cross - sections just border the line of @xmath36fb or less @xcite . in the latter reference , for instance , it has been shown that if the double and triple higgs production cross - sections would yield sufficiently high signal rates , the system of couplings could in principle be solved for all trilinear higgs self - couplings up to discrete ambiguities using only these processes . but this is perhaps a bit too optimistic since in practice these cross - sections are manifestly too small to be all measurable in a comfortable way .    in stark contrast to this meager panorama within the sm and the mssm , 3h couplings have been tested for tree - level processes in the context of the unconstrained 2hdm .",
    "for example , in ref.@xcite the tree - level production of triple higgs boson final states was considered in the ilc .",
    "there are three classes of processes of this kind compatible with @xmath37-conservation , namely @xmath38 where , in class 2 ) , we assume that the two neutral higgs bosons @xmath39 must be the same , i.e. the allowed final states are @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 . the cross - sections in the 2hdm were shown to reach up to @xmath43@xcite , i.e. several orders of magnitude over the corresponding mssm predictions@xcite .",
    "besides the exclusive production of three higgs bosons in the final state , also the inclusive pairwise production of higgs bosons may be critically sensitive to the 3h self - interactions . sizable production rates , again in the range of @xmath44 have recently been reported in ref.@xcite , whose focus was on the inclusive higgs boson - pair production at order @xmath4 through the mechanism of gauge - boson fusion @xmath45 similar effects have also been recently computed on 2h - strahlung processes of the guise @xmath46 @xcite . in a complementary way",
    ", 3h couplings can also be probed in loop - induced processes .",
    "for instance , ref .",
    "@xcite presents a computation of the single higgs boson production rate through the scattering process of i ) two real photons , using the @xmath25 mode of a linear collider , i.e. @xmath47 ; and ii ) the more traditional mechanism of virtual photon fusion in @xmath24 colliders , @xmath48 . in either case , the obtained cross sections within the general 2hdm ( up to @xmath49 for the first mechanism , and @xmath50 for the latter ) are 1 to 2 orders of magnitude larger than the expected sm yields and also well above the mssm results ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "promising signatures have also been reported within the general 2hdm using loop - induced production of two neutral higgs bosons through real @xmath25 collisions @xcite , although in this case the cross - sections are smaller than in the primary mechanism @xmath47 mentioned before .    a crucial observation concerning our aim here is the following : all the processes described above are directly sensitive to the 3h self - couplings already at the leading order . in this paper",
    ", we continue exploiting the properties of these couplings in the general 2hdm , but we concentrate now on their impact at the level of indirect effects through radiative corrections .",
    "the latter may significantly affect processes that are kinematically more favored ( e.g. because they have a smaller number of particles in the final state ) , but which are nevertheless totally insensitive to the trilinear higgs boson couplings at the lowest order .",
    "specifically , we wish to concentrate on identifying the largest quantum effects that the 3h couplings can stamp on the cross - sections for two - body neutral higgs boson final states : @xmath51 surprisingly enough , very little attention has been paid to these basic production processes and to the calculation of the corresponding radiative corrections within the 2hdm . in contrast",
    ", a lot of work has been invested on them from the point of view of the mssm@xcite  see also @xcite and references therein . to the best of our knowledge , only refs .",
    "@xcite have addressed this topic in the general 2hdm , although they are restricted to the production of charged higgs pairs @xmath52 . in the present paper",
    ", we shall be concerned exclusively on computing the quantum effects involved on the neutral higgs boson channels ( [ 2h ] ) at order @xmath53 ( and eventually also the leading @xmath54 terms ) . as we will see , very large quantum effects ( of order @xmath55 )",
    "may arise on the cross - sections of the two - body higgs boson channels ( [ 2h ] ) as a result of the enhancement capabilities of the triple ( and , to a lesser extent , also the quartic ) higgs boson self - interactions .",
    "these effects are completely unmatched within the mssm and should therefore be highly characteristic of non - supersymmetric higgs boson physics .",
    "the two - higgs - doublet model ( 2hdm ) is defined upon the canonical extension of the sm higgs sector with a second @xmath56 doublet with weak hypercharge @xmath57 , so that it contains @xmath58 complex scalar fields arranged as follows : @xmath59 with the help of these two weak - isospin doublets , we can write down the most general structure of the higgs potential fulfilling the conditions of @xmath16-conservation , gauge invariance and renormalizability . moreover , a discrete @xmath60 symmetry @xmath61  which will be exact up to soft - breaking terms of dimension 2  is usually imposed as a sufficient condition to guarantee the proper suppression of the flavor - changing neutral - current ( fcnc ) effects that would otherwise arise within the quark yukawa sector @xcite   symmetry , see e.g. @xcite and references therein . ]",

    "the complex degrees of freedom encoded within each higgs doublet in eq.([eq : h1h2 ] ) are conveniently split into real ones in the following way : @xmath66 upon diagonalization of the higgs potential  ( [ eq : potential ] ) we may obtain the physical higgs eigenstates in terms of the gauge ( weak - eigenstate ) basis : @xmath67 the parameter @xmath68 is given by the ratio of the two vev s giving masses to the up- and down - like quarks : @xmath69 incidentally , let us note that this parameter could be ideally measured in @xmath70 colliders@xcite since the charged higgs event rates with mixed decays , @xmath71 , do not involve the mixing angle @xmath72 .",
    "the physical content of the 2hdm embodies one pair of @xmath16-even higgs bosons ( @xmath73 , @xmath74 ) ; a single @xmath16-odd higgs boson ( @xmath21 ) ; and a couple of charged higgs bosons ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "the free parameters of the general 2hdm are usually chosen to be : the masses of the physical higgs particles ; the aforementioned parameter @xmath68 ; the mixing angle @xmath72 between the two @xmath16-even states ; and finally the coupling @xmath6 , which can not be absorbed in the previous quantities and becomes tied to the structure of the higgs self - couplings .",
    "to summarize , the vector of free inputs reads @xmath76 therefore , we are left with @xmath77 free parameters , which indeed correspond to the original @xmath78 couplings @xmath79 and the two vev s @xmath80  the latter being submitted to the constraint @xmath81 , which is valid order by order in perturbation theory , where @xmath82 is the @xmath83 mass and @xmath84 is the @xmath22 gauge coupling constant . the dimension 2 term that softly breaks the @xmath60 symmetry can be written as @xmath85 , with @xmath86 the second equality being valid at the tree - level . given @xmath68 one may trade the parameter @xmath6 for @xmath87 through this formula , if desired .",
    "since we are going to adopt the on - shell renormalization scheme@xcite for the one - loop calculation of the cross - sections ( cf .",
    "section [ sec : renorm ] ) , it is convenient to introduce the electromagnetic fine structure constant @xmath88 , which is one of the fundamental inputs in this scheme ( together with the physical @xmath89 mass , @xmath90 , and the higgs and fermion particle masses ) .",
    "the electron charge @xmath91 is connected to the original @xmath22 gauge coupling and weak mixing angle @xmath92 through the well - known relation @xmath93 , which is also preserved order by order in perturbation theory .",
    "then the @xmath83 mass can be related to @xmath94 and the fermi constant @xmath95 in the standard way in the on - shell scheme , namely @xmath96where the parameter @xmath97@xcite vanishes at the tree - level , but is affected by the radiative corrections to @xmath98-decay both from standard as well as from new physics , for instance from the mssm@xcite and also from the 2hdm ( see below ) .",
    "notice that , in the above formula , @xmath82 also enters implicitly through the relation @xmath99 , which is valid order by order in the on - shell scheme .",
    "since @xmath95 can be accurately determined from the @xmath98-decay , and @xmath90 has been measured with high precision at lep , it is natural to take them both as experimental inputs .",
    "then , with the help of the non - trivial relation ( [ deltar ] ) , the @xmath83 mass can be accurately predicted in a modified on - shell scheme where @xmath95 , rather than @xmath82 , enters as a physical input .",
    "we shall not dwell here on the detailed structure of the yukawa couplings of the higgs boson to fermions ( see for an exhaustive treatment ) , since their contribution to the processes @xmath100 under study at the one - loop level is largely subdominant in the main regions of parameter space .",
    "however , it is precisely the coupling pattern to fermions that motivates the distinction between the different types of 2hdm s , so let us briefly describe them .",
    "assuming natural flavor conservation@xcite , we must impose that at most one higgs doublet can couple to any particular fermion type . as a result , the coupling of the 2hdm higgs bosons with fermions ( say the quarks ) can be implemented in essentially two manners which insure the absence of potentially dangerous ( tree - level ) fcnc s , to wit ( cf .",

    "although both effects partially balance each other , we are ultimately left with the expected decoupling behavior in the limit of large higgs boson masses , with the proviso that such decoupling takes place in a softer way than that of the born - level cross section .",

    "in this work , we have undertaken a thorough investigation of the pairwise production of neutral higgs - bosons within the context of the general two - higgs - doublet model ( 2hdm ) at the ilc / clic linear colliders ( linac ) through the basic processes @xmath166 . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", this study is the first one existing in the literature which addresses these important processes at the one - loop level . to sum up the main objectives of our work",
    ", we can assert that we have concentrated on the following three tasks : i ) we have , on the one hand , singled out the most favorable regimes for the higgs - pair production processes once the radiative corrections are taken into account , specifically within the framework of the on - shell renormalization scheme with an appropriate definition of @xmath68 and of the @xmath16-even mixing angle @xmath72 at the quantum level ; ii ) next , we have carefully quantified the importance of the leading quantum corrections , and not only so , we have pinpointed also the origin and relative weigh of the various sources ; and , finally , iii ) we have correlated the most powerful source of quantum effects with the strength of the higgs boson self - interactions ( essentially the triple higgs boson self - couplings @xmath167 ) , to which the processes @xmath166 are highly sensitive through higgs - mediated one - loop diagrams . with these aims in mind , we have systematically searched over the 2hdm parameter space by considering different higgs boson mass scenarios and different values of the tree - level @xmath168 and @xmath144 couplings . at the same time , we have carefully explored the very frontiers of the generic 2hdm parameter space , specially the limits that can not be trespassed by the strengths of the various 3h self - couplings .    among the various subtle triggers that control the size of these important couplings , one of them stands out with overwhelming supremacy over the others , and this is the @xmath6 coupling .",
    "this is the only one parameter in the list of seven free parameters  cf .",
    "( [ freep ] )  conforming the structure of the general ( @xmath16-invariant ) higgs potential of the 2hdm that can not be ultimately traded for a physical mass or a mixing angle .",
    "this parameter is , in addition , the only higgs self - coupling that need not be renormalized at one loop in the current framework . despite its special status of being apparently unfettered and without obvious physical connotations , one quickly discovers that it becomes severely restrained by subtle bounds connected with the quantum field theoretical consistency of the model , namely the stringent constraints imposed by tree - level unitarity and vacuum stability conditions .",
    "these restrictions , together with the limitations dictated by custodial symmetry , and of course also those emerging in the light of the direct collider bounds on the masses of generic higgs boson models , not to mention the indirect phenomenological restraints ( in particular , the upper bound on the charged higgs mass in type - ii models ensuing from radiative @xmath169-meson decays ) , do indeed eventually determine a fairly compact region of parameter space .",
    "in particular , @xmath6 is compelled to be mostly negative and in the range @xmath170 . at the same time",
    ", @xmath68 can not be large when @xmath121 is also large without violating the constraints .",
    "the bottom line is that the value that maximizes the processes under consideration is a rather equitable one : @xmath171 .    notwithstanding the sharp limits placed upon the physical region of the parameter space , our explicit calculation of radiative corrections has shown  and we feel it is truly remarkable  that the general 2hdm models are still able to unleash a good deal of their `` repressed '' power . if only we could catch a smoking gun of this stupendous potential through the accurate measurements that a linear collider should be able to render on fundamental processes like @xmath172 , we might be on the verge of experiencing an intense episode of higgs boson physics beyond the sm . in the following ,",
    "we describe the basic results and strategies that we could follow to this effect .",
    "we have identified three main scenarios of potential phenomenological interest in the corresponding parameter space . in all of them",
    "we observe no remarkable dependence either on the details of the higgs mass spectrum nor on the pattern of higgs - fermion yukawa couplings ( either for type - i or type - ii 2hdm ) , not even on the particular channel @xmath173 under study . in what follows",
    "we describe each one of these scenarios and spell out clearly their differences , in particular we provide the characteristic potential size of the relative quantum correction @xmath117  cf .",
    "eq.([deltar ] )  typically associated to them ( cf . figs.[fig : scan - s2]-[fig : scan - s4 ] ) :    * * scenario 1*. to start with , regions of @xmath174 and large @xmath121 ( specifically , @xmath175 ) support the bulk of the radiative corrections .",
    "they may well reach @xmath176 at the largest attainable values of @xmath121 .",
    "furthermore , these effects critically depend on the actual size of @xmath121 and on the center - of - mass energy @xmath159 ( cf .",
    "figs.[fig : overs_s2]-[fig : overs_s4 ] ) , to wit : @xmath117 is positive at `` low '' center - of - mass energies around @xmath177 , while it is negative for @xmath178 and certainly also in the uppermost foreseeable energy segments @xmath179 , usually reserved for an upgraded ilc and specially for clic .",
    "thus , interestingly enough , quantum corrections turn out to drastically invigorate the cross section of the basic processes @xmath180 near the standard booting energy of the ilc , while they tend to suppress the two - body higgs boson signal for a center - of - mass energy some @xmath181 beyond this initial regime  and of course for the tev range and above  as a result of constructive / destructive interference effects , respectively , between the tree - level and the one - loop amplitudes .",
    "incidentally , we clarify that this optimal scenario can not be iterated for large and positive values of @xmath6 because the combined set of constraints ( mainly the vacuum stability bounds , in this case ) preclude most of the region @xmath182 ; * * scenario 2*. on the other hand , we find a tail of subleading effects within a band of the @xmath183 subspace at moderate @xmath184 and @xmath185 wherein the maximum radiative corrections turn out to stagnate and remain barely at the level of @xmath186 or less .",
    "should the parameters of the model inhabit this region , the practical possibilities to detect these effects would obviously become thinner than in the previous case .",
    "still , @xmath187 effects are not that alien to the high precision standards planned for a linac collider , and hence it should not deter us from the searching task . at this point , the detection strategies associated to the higgs boson decay patterns could be essential ( see below ) ; * * scenario 3*. finally , there is the region of parameter space where the coupling @xmath6 is very small or it just vanishes . here",
    "the quantum corrections can still have a chance provided @xmath188 , and indeed we have found domains of this kind preserving all the basic constraints . while this region is not the most favored one ,",
    "neither from the theoretical point of view nor from the experimental data , specially if @xmath189 , we should keep it in mind as a possibility .",
    "even for moderately small @xmath68 , say for @xmath190 , it can be the source of sizeable quantum effects of order @xmath191 ( and positive ) , which are larger than those in scenario 2 and , in some cases , even comparable to those in scenario 1 .",
    "it is worth noticing that , in this region , there is an interesting collaborative interplay between the higgs boson trilinear self - couplings and the top quark yukawa coupling ( which is the same in type i or type ii 2hdm s ) . only in this scenario",
    "a yukawa coupling could play a significant quantitative role on equal footing with the trilinear higgs boson self - couplings .",
    "obviously , the success of the whole higgs boson search endeavor will also depend on the pattern of distinctive signatures available to these particles in the final state .",
    "for instance , for @xmath192 , we should basically expect back - to - back pairs of highly energetic ( roughly @xmath193 ) and collimated b - quark and/or @xmath194-lepton jets from @xmath195 which , in contrast to the lhc , . and of course the same reasoning applies to the @xmath196 final state . for @xmath197 ,",
    "on the other hand , signatures from @xmath198 and @xmath199 could also play a role ( depending on the particular choice of @xmath72 and @xmath108 , cf .",
    "table [ tab : coup ] ) .",
    "they could ultimately lead to signatures with two ( up to four ) charged leptons against a @xmath200 or @xmath201 pair in the final state ( from @xmath202 and , specially , from @xmath203 ) .",
    "even if the branching ratios of gauge bosons into leptons are very small ( @xmath204),the predicted number of higgs - pair events is large enough so that , in the most favorable scenarios , one could collect @xmath205 events for these complementary signatures , which could be instrumental for a final tagging and identification of the higgs bosons . notice that we use the fact that the @xmath16-odd @xmath21 `` always '' decays into @xmath200 or , to a lesser extent , to @xmath201 ( even for @xmath206 ) as it can not couple to gauge bosons .",
    "so the patterns of signatures are rather characteristic and could not be missed in normal circumstances .",
    "but there is more than meets the eye in the whole strategy game , as we shall see later on .    in the most favorable regimes ( scenario 1 )",
    ", the experimental chances could be spectacular , especially in the case of relatively light higgs boson mass spectrum and a large ( negative ) value of @xmath6 , for which the predicted one - loop cross sections @xmath207 at @xmath208 may border the @xmath209 level .",
    "this would translate into barely @xmath210 events per @xmath211 of integrated luminosity at the linac .",
    "while the former situation describes perhaps the most optimistic possibility , cross sections of @xmath148 at @xmath208 should be quite common in a wide patch of the 2hdm parameter space , and correspondingly of @xmath212 at @xmath213 ( see table [ tab : masses ] ) , thus delivering rates that range from a few hundred to a few thousand events respectively .",
    "with this level of statistics ( plus a comparable number of events from the @xmath141 channel ) it should be perfectly possible to insure a comfortable tagging of the higgs bosons in the clean environment of a linac machine .",
    "most important , we have been able to demonstrate that the dominant quantum effects are , as we expected , primarily nurtured by the higgs - mediated one - loop corrections to the @xmath214 vertices , and can be ultimately traced back to the potentially enhanced 3h self - interactions @xmath167 ( cf . table ii ) .",
    "this is indeed a trademark feature of the 2hdm , with no counterpart in the mssm  in which susy invariance highly curtails the structure of the higgs boson self - interactions and compels them to be purely gauge - like .",
    "obviously , probing the structure of higgs boson self - interactions  in the present case through the analysis of radiative corrections on direct production processes  is a most useful strategy to disentangle susy and non - susy higgs physics scenarios .    to be specific , for the analysis of the @xmath215 cross sections we have faced the computation of the full set of @xmath3 quantum effects , among them the subset of @xmath216 corrections , and supplemented them with the leading @xmath4 pieces arising from the square of the one - loop diagrams involving higgs boson self - couplings .",
    "these ( finer ) corrections are of @xmath217 ( see , however , below ) .",
    "their inclusion is actually _ a must _ at large center - of - mass energies ( i.e. once @xmath159 has left behind the startup situation , and of course also in the @xmath218 regime ) .",
    "the reason is that the tree - level @xmath219 and the one - loop @xmath3 amplitudes virtually cancel out each other at high energies , owing to the characteristic large and negative quantum effects in this regime .",
    "we can convince ourselves of this fact from the severe depletion exhibited by the one - loop curves ",
    "see e.g. figs .",
    "[ fig : overs_s2]-[fig : overs_s4 ]  as compared to the tree - level ones .",
    "typically , the effect appears after we increase the center - of - mass energy by @xmath116 beyond the initial @xmath220 , and persists till 1 tev and afterwards . at large energies , the inclusion of the @xmath217 effects is a consistency requirement as it prevents the cross - section from becoming negative .",
    "these terms can actually be relevant also at the initial energy interval @xmath221 at which the linac will first operate ; for example , for the scenarios with maximally enhanced 3h self - couplings , they may lead to an additional @xmath222 contribution to @xmath117 , hence pushing the overall quantum correction even higher . in this respect",
    ", we note that our earlier estimate of these higher order terms , eq.([eq : estimate2 ] ) , was able to hit the right order of magnitude , although it actually underestimates the maximum size revealed by the exact numerical analysis  not too surprising from such a rough attempt at guessing their bulk size .",
    "let us clarify that the two - loop diagrams involving the higgs boson - mediated @xmath214 vertex corrections , lead of course also to amplitudes of order @xmath217 .",
    "these are actually finite , and originate from the interference of the tree - level amplitude with the two - loop one .",
    "an obvious concern is then the following : can we safely neglect them ? upon inspection of the higgs - mediated two - loop diagrams , and taking into account power counting and dynamical considerations , one can show that they are actually suppressed , and particularly so for those scenarios where @xmath223 is optimized .",
    "but , most significantly , there is a deeper observation to be adduced at this point , which is well in the spirit of the effective field theory approach to qft .",
    "the ( finite ) two - loop effects induced by the enhanced higgs boson self - couplings can be conveniently reabsorbed in the form of one - loop corrections to the bare higgs self - couplings , which first appear at the one - loop level in the process under consideration .",
    "we can iterate this algorithm at any order in perturbation theory by further reabsorbing the higher order higgs mediated loops into the triple _ and _ quartic higgs self - couplings introduced at one - loop order . in this way we can define a collection of effective 3h and 4h self - couplings that encapsulate all these higher order effects .",
    "the above remark is an interesting one , as it tells us that the application of the stringent tree - level unitarity relations that we have used can be directly reiterated for these effective couplings .",
    "therefore , no matter how big are the quantum corrections induced by the 3h self - couplings in subsequent orders of perturbation theory , their overall effect is constrained by the same set of formal unitarity relations .",
    "if expressed in terms of the original couplings , these relations will be equally stringent so that , on balance , the maximum enhancement capabilities of the 3h self - couplings are basically the same at any order of perturbation theory .",
    "this is the procedure adopted in the present work , and we believe it is perfectly consistent , in the sense that we have retained the contributions to the @xmath224 amplitudes at leading order in the 3h self - couplings while employing the unitarity constraints of ref .",
    "@xcite-@xcite , also derived at leading order in @xmath167 .",
    "how do our results compare with the expectations in the mssm ? as we have stressed in section ii ,",
    "a lot of work on higgs boson production in @xmath24 colliders has been reported in the literature thus far , but mainly within the context of the mssm .",
    "in particular , supersymmetric radiative corrections to @xmath122 have been considered in detail , although mostly in the context of lep and including sometimes a more or less timid incursion into the tev - class colliders , cf .",
    "let us try to see how some of these results compare with ours .",
    "for the sake of definiteness , let us concentrate on the particular case of ref .",
    "@xcite , in which @xmath225 is analyzed in the mssm for a linear collider operating at lep 2 energy and further extended up to @xmath128 . in the most favorable regimes",
    ", the loop - corrected cross sections may reach up to barely @xmath226 at @xmath128 , which falls in the ballpark of the results that we have obtained here within the 2hdm .",
    "this is not surprising because in both cases the leading amplitude ( i.e. the lowest order one ) is purely gauge and hence the order of magnitude of the cross - section is independent of whether we compute it in the mssm or in a generic 2hdm .",
    "quantum effects can be fairly efficient in the mssm too , and they may also boost the tree - level predictions substantially ( @xmath227 ) . however , their size is never as big as the maximal 2hdm contributions ; and , no less important for our conceptual understanding , the fundamental origin of these quantum effects is completely different from that of the 2hdm . as already mentioned in the introduction , the leading quantum effects in the mssm are due to the genuine higgs - quark , higgs - squark and quark - squark - chargino / neutralino yukawa - like supersymmetric couplings , whose contributions carry enhancement factors of the fashion @xmath228 , none of them related to the structure of the higgs potential and hence none of them associated to higgs boson self - couplings .    in contradistinction to the mssm ,",
    "the 3h self - couplings in the 2hdm embody the full potential for triggering quantum effects in physical processes , and these effects become thence tied to the very structure of the higgs potential .",
    "even if quantitatively similar in some scenarios , quantum effects in susy and non - susy two - higgs doublet extensions of the sm are , therefore , prompted by intrinsically different mechanisms . in practice ,",
    "the task of distinguishing whether the produced higgs boson particles at a linac are supersymmetric or not can start by addressing the decaying signatures of the higgs bosons into @xmath200 or @xmath201 pairs , as sketched above .",
    "however , in certain regions of parameter space the number of events can be by itself a direct signature of the sort of higgs model that we have behind .",
    "for example , in the mssm , the tree - level coupling @xmath229 undergoes a severe suppression with growing values of @xmath68 and/or @xmath125  as @xmath72 depends on @xmath125 in the mssm .",
    "thereby the predicted cross sections , either at the born or at the one - loop level , are dramatically weakened as a function of @xmath125 .",
    "for instance , @xmath230 at @xmath231 and @xmath232 may end up as tiny as @xmath233 ( see e.g. fig .",
    "9 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) while the 2hdm prediction is of @xmath148 , i.e. one thousand times bigger !",
    "but there is more to say here , as we have announced above .",
    "the identification strategy can be highly facilitated through the interplay of further 2h ( and eventually 3h ) channels , such as ( [ 3h ] ) and ( [ 2hx ] ) , which are also highly distinctive in the 2hdm  see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in fact , for these channels the difference with the mssm can be apparent already at the lowest order of perturbation theory .",
    "let us be a bit more quantitative here . in table",
    "[ tableend ] , we compare the numerical predictions on the cross - sections of these various processes in truly equitable conditions , i.e. for different sets of common parameters for all the processes , and for three realistic values of the center - of - mass energy of the ilc / clic ( the latter operating always at the highest edge of the energy band , although it could nominally reach the 3tev end ) .    to be more precise , the cross - sections that we are comparing on equal footing in table  [ tableend ] are the following : i ) the one - loop corrected @xmath234 ; ii ) the leading - order @xmath3 cross - sections of the two triple higgs production processes @xmath235 ; and iii ) @xmath236 ) at leading - order @xmath4 .",

    "the latter process , @xmath250 , becomes indeed the most efficient one at the highest energies since it is not crippled by the s - channel propagator ; quite on the contrary , its cross - section increases steadily with the energy ( see ref.@xcite for details ) .",
    "therefore , in the upgraded phase of the ilc , and certainly for the clic collider , one must concentrate all the search strategy power on looking for an anomalously large number of inclusive higgs boson pairs of the type @xmath251 , @xmath252 , @xmath140 and @xmath253 , which should emerge mostly acollinear and dynamically thrusted along the beam direction , rather than appearing in a simple back - to - back geometry characteristic of the two - body process @xmath248 .",
    "notice furthermore that , in contradistinction to the latter , the fused pairs consist of identical higgs bosons .",
    "unmistakeably , the predicted numbers in table [ tableend ] could not , by any means , be accounted for if they were to be ascribed to a supersymmetric origin .",
    "finally , the cross - correlation of these higher energy effects with the previous ones at lower energies , which we could track very well while upgrading the ilc collider from @xmath254tev up to @xmath255tev  and eventually till @xmath256tev ( through clic )  should provide plenty of unambiguous evidence of non - supersymmetric higgs physics gauge boson : @xmath257 ( @xmath258 ) , also called `` higgs - strahlung '' processes ; see @xcite for a thorough study at the quantum level in the general 2hdm . ] .",
    "let us finally introduce a remark that hints at the potentially far reaching implications of the 2hdm dynamics in different sectors of particle physics .",
    "the triple higgs boson self - couplings could also have an indirect impact on the best high precision observables at our disposal , even well before the ilc / clic colliders are commissioned and put effectively to work . for example , they could have a bearing on the famous electroweak precision parameter @xmath259 ",
    "see eq.([deltar ] ) .",
    "since our main aim here has been to exploit the leading contributions from the higgs boson self - couplings in the arena of the direct production processes ( [ 2h ] ) , the @xmath97 part did not enter our quantum computation ; it would only enter at two - loop level .",
    "however , we suspect@xcite that the influence of the 3h self - couplings on @xmath97 might have a real interest _ per se",
    "_ , for it could induce a correction to @xmath138 and ultimately trigger a shift in the @xmath83 mass , and the result might well compete with the highly accurate calculations that have been performed on this observable within the alternative framework of the mssm@xcite .",
    "to summarize , if the genuine enhancement properties of the 2hdm effectively hold in the real world , the combined analysis of the exclusive double higgs production ( 2h ) processes at the startup energy of the ilc , @xmath220 , and subsequently of the triple ( 3h ) and inclusive double higgs production processes ( @xmath260 ) at the upgraded ilc / clic ( @xmath261 ) , might reveal strong hints of higgs boson physics beyond the sm .",
    "the bottom line of our study is that the physics of the linear colliders can be truly instrumental to unveil the nature of the higgs bosons .",
    "these bosons may , or may not , have been discovered during the lhc era while the linear colliders take the floor , but the real issue at stake here is of highest priority and should strengthen the need for such machines .",
    "high precision higgs boson physics in a linac can indeed provide a keen insight into the most sensitive building blocks of modern gauge theories of weak and electromagnetic interactions , viz . in the very core architecture of the electroweak symmetry breaking .",

    "<S> the pairwise production of neutral higgs bosons ( @xmath0@xmath1 , @xmath2@xmath1 ) is analyzed in the context of the future linear colliders , such as the ilc and clic , within the general two - higgs - doublet model ( 2hdm ) . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding cross - sections are computed at the one - loop level , including the full set of contributions at order @xmath3 together with the leading @xmath4 terms , in full compliance with the current phenomenological bounds and the stringent theoretical constraints inherent to the consistency of the model . </S>",
    "<S> we uncover regions across the 2hdm parameter space , mainly for low @xmath5 and moderate  and negative  values of the relevant @xmath6 parameter , wherein the radiative corrections to the higgs - pair production cross section , @xmath7 , can comfortably reach @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior can be traced back to the enhancement capabilities of the trilinear higgs self - interactions  a trademark feature of the 2hdm , with no counterpart in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) . </S>",
    "<S> the corrections are strongly dependent on the actual value of @xmath6 as well as on the higgs mass spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly enough , the quantum effects are positive for energies around @xmath9 , thereby producing a significant enhancement in the expected number of events precisely around the fiducial startup energy of the ilc </S>",
    "<S> . the higgs - pair production rates can be substantial , typically a few tens of femtobarn , therefore amounting to a few thousand events per @xmath10 of integrated luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the corrections are negative in the highest energy range ( viz . @xmath11 and above ) . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that a precise measurement of the 2h final states could carry unambiguous footprints of an extended ( non - supersymmetric ) higgs sector . finally , to better assess the scope of these effects , we compare the exclusive pairwise production of higgs bosons with the inclusive gauge boson fusion channels leading to @xmath12 final states , and also with the exclusive triple higgs boson production . </S>",
    "<S> we find that these multiparticle final states can be highly complementary in the overall higgs bosons search strategy . </S>"
