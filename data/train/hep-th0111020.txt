    "there has recently been much interest in non - commutative geometry , @xcite , both as a novel direction in string theory @xcite and as a new tool in quantum field theory @xcite . in the latter approach",
    "the theory is formulated on a `` fuzzy '' space , a series of discrete approximations to a continuous space - time manifold @xmath4 .",
    "the space of fields on each approximation is finite - dimensional , so the fuzzy space serves as a regulator , similar to a lattice .",
    "in contrast to the latter , the truncation enjoys all symmetries of the approximated continuous manifold .",
    "this has several useful implications including the absence of a doubling problem for chiral fermions @xcite .",
    "topologically non - trivial field configurations can be included and the chiral anomaly emerges naturally in this approach @xcite .    in more detail , a fuzzy space is given by a series of finite - dimensional algebras @xmath5 that approximate the commutative algebra of functions on @xmath4 in the following way : each @xmath5 is identified with a subset of functions on @xmath4 and the product in @xmath5 induces a ( non - commutative ) product of functions in this subset , the so - called star product ; in the limit @xmath6 , the subset should exhaust the set of all functions and the star product go over to the ( commutative ) pointwise product of functions . in the present case ,",
    "the algebras @xmath5 are full matrix algebras .",
    "the fuzzy spaces are thus matrix geometries , which go over to the usual continuous manifold as the size of the matrix is taken to infinity .",
    "non - commutative star products are known to exist for every poisson manifold , in particular for symplectic manifolds @xcite .",
    "star products realised by finite - dimensional matrix algebras have been constructed in @xcite for all homogeneous khler manifolds provided a certain quantisation condition on the metric is satisfied .",
    "these algebras can also be obtained using generalised coherent states @xcite or the method of orbits for irreducible representations of lie groups @xcite .",
    "the relation between these approaches has been discussed in @xcite and that to deformation quantisation in @xcite . for the relation to fourier transformation on group space see @xcite . in terms of functions on the manifold ,",
    "the above formulations provide an expression of the star product as an integral over the analytical continuation of the functions .",
    "this is not very convenient for explicit calculations in non - commutative field theory .",
    "an explicit , local formula in terms of a finite number of derivatives is so far only known for complex projective spaces @xcite including the case of the fuzzy 2-sphere @xcite already treated in @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we derive an analogous formula for fuzzy complex grassmannians , that is finite matrix geometry approximations to the usual grassmannians , @xmath7 $ ] , which are homogeneous spaces isomorphic to the space of complex @xmath8-planes in @xmath9 .",
    "the matrix geometries consist of matrices acting on the irreducible representation of @xmath10 which is given by the @xmath11-fold young product of the representation on antisymmetric @xmath8-tensors . as @xmath11",
    "is increased the continuous grassmannian is recovered .",
    "the special case @xmath12 requires the @xmath11-fold symmetric product of the fundamental representation of @xmath10 , as in @xcite .",
    "the star product for the case @xmath13 is constructed explicitly , using globally well - defined but over - complete co - ordinates on the grassmannian .",
    "the result is expressed as a finite sum over multiple derivatives of the functions , which are decomposed into irreducible representations of the stability group @xmath14 $ ] acting on the tangent space .",
    "it is shown that the star product reduces to the usual commutative product as @xmath15 .",
    "the particular case @xmath16 may be of some interest in field theory as it is a symplectic manifold which has @xmath17 as a lagrangian sub - manifold .",
    "the corresponding matrix geometries can be viewed as non - commutative versions of @xmath18 , the co - tangent bundle to @xmath17 @xcite . a star product on the complex grassmannians as an infinite sum over derivatives",
    "is known @xcite . however",
    ", this formula can not be restricted to finite - dimensional sub - algebras and therefore can not serve as a star product on a fuzzy approximation to the manifold .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows : in section  [ sec : grassmann ] we describe the complex grassmannians , @xmath19 , in terms of projection operators acting in @xmath9 , we introduce a set of global co - ordinates which are over - complete and satisfy a set of quadratic constraints which ensures that they indeed describe @xmath19 ; in section  [ sec : harmonic ] we analyse the algebra of functions in terms of representations of @xmath10 ; in section  [ sec : matrix ] we describe the finite matrix geometries that define the fuzzy grassmannians @xmath20 ; section  [ sec : star ] gives the construction of the star product for the special case @xmath13 , @xmath21 , while section  [ sec : observations ] presents a conjecture on the possible form for @xmath22 and some observations on the construction ; section  [ sec : conclusions ] gives a summary and conclusions and some technical details are relegated to the appendices .",

    "this is easily seen since any such projector can be diagonalised by an element of @xmath26 and there is still a residual adjoint action of @xmath27 which leaves it invariant .",

    "this means that @xmath54 itself is a projector onto the tangent space of @xmath55 , with rank @xmath56 .",
    "an important observation for the following analysis is that the differential operators @xmath57 commute with the constraints ( [ eq : constraints ] ) , as they must do , since @xmath58 projects onto the tangent space .",
    "this can also be proven using ( [ eq : kaytee ] ) .",
    "it is this fact that allows us to use the global co - ordinates , rather than local co - ordinates , in the final differential expression for the star product .",
