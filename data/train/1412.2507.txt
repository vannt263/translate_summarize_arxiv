    "hadronic distribution amplitudes ( das ) provide essential information on the qcd interaction of quarks , antiquarks and gluons inside the hadrons and play an essential role in applying qcd to hard exclusive processes .",
    "they are the longitudinal projection of the hadronic wave functions obtained by integrating the transverse momenta of the fundamental constituents  @xcite .",
    "these nonperturbative quantities are defined as vacuum - to - hadron matrix elements of particular nonlocal quark or quark - gluon operators and thus encode important information on bound states in strong interaction physics .",
    "it has motivated many studies using various nonperturbative models @xcite and led to develop distinct phenomenological models over the past two decades . among them ,",
    "the light - front quark model ( lfqm ) appears to be one of the most efficient and effective tools in hadron physics as it takes advantage of the distinguished features of the light - front dynamics ( lfd )  @xcite . in particular",
    ", the lfd carries the maximum number  ( seven ) of the kinetic ( or interaction independent ) generators and thus the less effort in dynamics is necessary in order to get the qcd solutions that reflect the full poincar@xmath0 symmetries .",
    "moreover , the rational energy - momentum dispersion relation of lfd , namely @xmath1 , yields the sign correlation between the lf energy @xmath2 and the lf longitudinal momentum @xmath3 and leads to the suppression of quantum fluctuations of the vacuum , sweeping the complicated vacuum fluctuations into the zero - modes in the limit of @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "this simplification is a remarkable advantage in lfd and facilitates the partonic interpretation of the amplitudes .",
    "based on the advantages of the lfd , the lfqm has been developed  @xcite and subsequently applied for various meson phenomenologies such as the mass spectra of both heavy and light mesons  @xcite , the decay constants , das , form factors and generalized parton distributions  @xcite .    despite these successes in reproducing the general features of the data ,",
    "however , it has proved very difficult to obtain direct connection between the lfqm and qcd . to discuss the link between the chiral symmetry of qcd and the numerical results of the lfqm",
    ", we recently presented a self - consistent covariant description of vector meson decay constants and chirality - even quark - antiquark das up to twist 3 in lfqm  @xcite .",
    "although the meson decay amplitude described by a two - point function could be regarded as one of the simplest possible physical observables , it is interesting that this apparently simple amplitude bears abundant fundamental information on qcd vacuum dynamics and chiral symmetry . in particular , we discussed the zero - mode issue in the lfqm prediction of vector meson decay constants from the perspective of the vacuum fluctuation consistent with the chiral symmetry of qcd and extended the exactly solvable manifestly covariant bethe - salpeter  ( bs ) model calculation to the more phenomenologically accessible realistic lfqm .    to discuss the nature of the lf zero - mode in meson decay amplitude , we may denote the total lf longitudinal momentum of the meson , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the individual quark and antiquark lf longitudinal momenta , respectively .",
    "similarly , the total lf energy @xmath8 is shared by the individual quark and antiquark lf energies @xmath9 and @xmath10 , i.e. @xmath11 . for the lf energy integration of the two - point function over @xmath9 or @xmath10 to compute the meson decay amplitude , one may use the cauchy s theorem for a contour integration and pick up the lf energy pole , e.g. either @xmath12_{\\rm on}$ ] ( i.e. on - shell value of @xmath9 ) from the quark propagator or @xmath13_{\\rm on}$ ] from the antiquark propagator .",
    "however , it is crucial to note that the poles move to infinity ( or fly away in the complex plane ) as the lf longitudinal momentum , either @xmath6 or @xmath7 , goes to zero  @xcite .",
    "unless the contribution from the pole flown into infinity vanishes , it must be kept in computing the physical observable that must reflect the full poincar@xmath0 symmetries . since such contribution , if it exists , appears either from @xmath14 and @xmath15 or from @xmath16 and @xmath17 , we call it as the zero - mode contribution . in the case of two - point function for the computation of the meson decay constant , the zero - mode contribution is thus locked into a single point of the lf longitudinal momentum , i.e. either @xmath14 where @xmath15 or @xmath16 where @xmath17 .",
    "as one of the constituents of the meson carries the entire momentum @xmath18 of the meson in this case , the other constituent carries the zero lf longitudinal momentum that can be regarded as the zero - mode quantum fluctuation linked to the vacuum .",
    "this link is due to a pair creation of particles with zero lf longitudinal momenta from the vacuum and it is important to capture the vacuum effect for the consistency with the chiral symmetry properties of the strong interactions  @xcite . with this link , the zero - mode contribution in the meson decay process can be considered effectively as the effect of vacuum fluctuation consistent with the chiral symmetry of the strong interactions . in this respect ,",
    "the lfqm with effective degrees of freedom represented by the constituent quark and antiquark may be linked to the qcd since the zero - mode link to the qcd vacuum may provide the view of an effective zero - mode cloud around the quark and antiquark inside the meson .",
    "although the constituents are dressed by the zero - mode cloud , they are still expected to satisfy the chiral symmetry consistent with the qcd .",
    "our numerical results  @xcite were indeed consistent with this expectation and effectively indicated that the constituent quark and antiquark in the standard lfqm  @xcite could be considered as the dressed constituents including the zero - mode quantum fluctuations from the qcd vacuum .    since the constituent quark and antiquark used in the lfqm have already absorbed the zero - mode cloud , the zero - mode contribution in the lfqm may not be as explicit as in the manifestly covariant model calculation although it effectively provides the consistency with the chiral symmetry .",
    "the standard light - front ( slf ) approach of the lfqm , with which the observables are directly computed in 3-dimensional lf momentum space , is not amenable to determine the zero - mode contribution by itself and thus it has been a common practice to utilize an exactly solvable manifestly covariant bs model to check the existence ( or absence ) of the zero - mode as one can pin down the zero mode exactly in the manifestly covariant bs model . within the covariant bs model , we indeed found the nonvanishing zero modes in the vector meson decay amplitude and identified the corresponding zero - mode operators that can be applied to the lfqm .",
    "we also found the self - consistent correspondence relations ( see e.g. eq .  ( 49 ) in  @xcite ) between the covariant bs model and the lfqm that allow the substitution of the radial and spin - orbit wave functions of the exactly solvable model by the more phenomenologically accessible model wave functions that can be provided by the lfqm analysis of meson masses  @xcite .",
    "what is remarkable in our finding  @xcite is that the nonvanishing zero - mode contributions as well as the instantaneous ones to the vector meson decay amplitude appeared in the covariant bs model now vanish explicitly when the phenomenological wave function such as the gaussian wave function in lfqm is used through the aforementioned correspondence relation . in another words , the decay constants and the quark das of vector mesons can be obtained only from the on - mass - shell valence contribution within the framework of the standard lfqm  @xcite using the gaussian radial wave function and they still satisfy the chiral symmetry consistent with the qcd .",
    "one of the key ingredients for this finding is the isospin symmetry , namely , the symmetric das for the equal quark and antiquark bound state mesons ( e.g. @xmath19 meson ) . under the exchange of the lf longitudinal momentum fraction of the quark and antiquark , @xmath20 , the da of the meson with the two equal - mass constituents must be symmetric , @xmath21 .",
    "we exploited this fundamental constraint anticipated from the isospin symmetry to identify the correct das in lfqm .",
    "the twist-2 and twist-3 das of the @xmath19 meson obtained only from the on - mass - shell valence constituents in lfqm  @xcite not only satisfy this constraint anticipated from the isospin symmetry but also reproduce the correct asymptotic das in the chiral symmetry limit .",
    "knowing that the higher - twist das may come from the contributions of the higher fock - states such as pair terms as well as the transverse motion of constituents in the leading twist components  @xcite , we should further attest that our lfqm formulation for the twist-3 da is indeed simple without involving zero modes and thus the connected contributions to the current arising from the vacuum disappear in our lfqm calculation , yet preserves all the necessary constraints anticipated from the isospin symmetry and the chiral symmetry .    the purpose of this work is to extend our previous work to analyze the decay amplitude related with twist-3 das of a pseudoscalar meson within the lfqm and show that the analysis of pseudoscalar mesons fortify our previous conclusion drawn from the vector meson case  @xcite .",
    "that is , the treacherous points such as the zero - mode and the instantaneous contributions present in the covariant bs model disappear in the standard lfqm with the gaussian radial wave function but nevertheless satisfy the chiral symmetry .",
    "the twist-3 das of a pseudoscalar meson appear to play an important role in constraining our lfqm to be consistent with the conclusion drawn from our previous analysis of the vector meson decay constant .",
    "the twist-2 da of a pseudoscalar meson has been analyzed in our previous work of lfqm  @xcite .",
    "essentially , there are two independent twist-3 two - particle das of a pseudoscalar meson , namely , @xmath22 and @xmath23  @xcite corresponding to pseudoscalar and tensor channels of a meson ( @xmath24 ) , respectively . in this work",
    ", we shall study @xmath22 together with the twist-2 da @xmath25 corresponding to the axial - vector channel for the sake of completeness .",
    "the @xmath25 and @xmath22 are defined in terms of the following matrix elements of gauge invariant nonlocal operators at light - like separation  @xcite : [ deq:1 ] 0||q(z)[z ,- z]^_5 q(-z)|m(p)= if_m p^^1_0 dx e^ipz",

    ", we again utilize the same manifestly covariant model used in the analysis of the vector meson decay constant  @xcite and then substitute the vertex function with the more phenomenologically accessible gaussian radial wave function provided by our lfqm .",
    "we shall show that the analysis of the decay constants and twist-2 and twist-3 two - particle das of pseudoscalar mesons confirms our previous conclusion drawn for the vector meson analysis  @xcite .",
    "namely , the treacherous points such as the zero - mode and the instantaneous contributions appeared in the covariant bs model do not show up explicitly in the standard lfqm with the gaussian radial wave function but nevertheless satisfy the chiral symmetry .",
    "in addition , we show that our findings of the zero - mode complication in two - point function is directly applicable to the three - point function with the analysis of the pion elastic form factor .",
    "the analyses of the pion form factor using the plus component ( @xmath38 ) of the lf currents have been done in many earlier works  @xcite and proved that the pion form factor is immune to the zero - mode contribution when the plus component of the currents is used .",
    "particularly , in our lfqm analysis of the pion form factor  @xcite , we have shown that the usual power - law behavior of the pion form factor obtained in the perturbative qcd analysis can also be attained by taking negligible quark masses in our nonperturbative lfqm analysis , confirming the anti - de sitter space geometry / conformal field theory ( ads / cft ) correspondence  @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we analyze the pion form factor using the perpendicular components ( @xmath39 ) of the currents . within the covariant bs model ,",
    "we find that the form factor obtained in the @xmath40 frame with @xmath39 receives only the valence contribution including both the on - mass - shell quark propagating part and the off - mass - shell instantaneous part without involving a zero mode .",
    "applying this to the lfqm , we find that the nonvanishing instantaneous contribution appeared in the bs model does not appear and just the on - mass - shell propagating part contributes in the lfqm .",
