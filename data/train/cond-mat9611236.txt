    "the reader might be slightly surprised ( perhaps even baffled ? ) by this contribution .",
    "indeed it has nothing to do directly with the main topic of these proceedings , namely strings , membranes and duality .",
    "it is however a tradition ( and a good one ! ) to include in this cycle of conferences some applications of quantum field theory to condensed matter physics .",
    "but in the case of our contribution , not only its subject , the mathematical analysis of disordered systems , is quite marginal from the point of view of the main theme of the conference , but also its form .",
    "it is not a `` pedagogical introductory review '' on the subject ( for such a review we refer e.g. to [ a][s ] ) .",
    "we chosed indeed to give here the main technical elements of the proof of a non - perturbative regularity theorem on the anderson model of an electron scattered by a random potential .",
    "we hope that glancing at this paper might nevertheless be amusing or even useful to the reader for two reasons .",
    "first the arid details of the mathematical bounds below will remind us how much effort is necessary to transform into proof even what certainly looks as the most trivial of all theoretical issues .",
    "second we hope that the reader might be interested by the tool that was recently introduced in this area , namely a new category of random matrices which have constraints of a geometrical origin .",
    "the free random matrices with independent entries considered by wigner , dyson and others ( and to the theory of which claude itzykson contributed so successfully ) held the key to many unexpected theoretical developments which range from nuclear physics and confinement to quantum gravity and non - perturbative strings .",
    "there is now a general mathematical frame for such matrices , namely the free non commutative probability theory of voiculescu [ v ] . in this frame",
    ", wigner s law appears very general : it is simply the non commutative analog of the gaussian law of large numbers for independent ordinary ( commutative ) random processes .",
    "but the theory of _ constrained _ non commutative processes remains to be developed .",
    "there are many three dimensional problems ( the bcs theory , the anderson model , scattering of particles in 3 or 4 dimensional minkovski space ) that can be discretized as problems of random matrices with geometrical constraints of the type considered below in section 4 .",
    "these matrices seem definitely to have quite different scaling properties from the usual ones with independent entries .",
    "perhaps they might also become useful tools in many other domains , when integrability and two dimensional conservation laws are no longer available .",
    "therefore we think that the scaling properties of such random matrices of non - free type deserve to be further investigated , even numerically .",
    "the anderson model of a single electron in a random potential was introduced to study the concept of localization .",
    "rigorous results in dimensions not restricted to 1 up to now concern the localization regime .",
    "the first result of this kind was the multiscale analysis of frhlich and spencer , who proved absence of diffusion for large disorder or energy out of the conduction band [ fs ] .",
    "it was later proved that in this regime localization holds , namely the expectation value of the modulus of the green s function decays exponentially and the spectrum of the hamiltonian is almost surely pure point [ dls ] , [ fmss ] .",
    "the proofs have been simplified more recently by an argument due to aizenman and molchanov [ am ] , which is based on considering the expectation value of the modulus of the green s function to a power strictly smaller than one .",
    "however almost nothing rigorous is known about the `` extended states '' regime where the energy lies in the middle of the spectrum of the free hamiltonian and the disorder is weak .",
    "this is the regime where diffusive conduction should take place , at least in 3 dimensions .",
    "there are only results at @xmath2 by klein [ k ] .",
    "we think that the program of renormalization group around singular manifolds should be useful to study this regime .",
    "this program was originally developed for the study of many fermions and in particular for a rigorous understanding of the bcs theory of superconductivity [ ft ] , [ fmrt1 ] . in that context , the singular manifold was the fermi surface . in the case of the anderson model , the singular manifold is simply defined by the equation @xmath3 , namely it is a sphere for a free rotation invariant hamiltonian ; in the case of a lattice model breaking rotation invariance , one would have a slightly more complicated manifold such as e.g. @xmath4 .",
    "this renormalization group analysis consists in slicing the free green s function around the singular locus in momentum space , and performing a phase space analysis ( by means of cluster expansions ) which allows to compute the long range behavior governed by the effective theory near the singularity .    in order to control this renormalization group analysis",
    "it is useful to understand the behavior of the theory in a single momentum slice , hence slightly away from the singularity , and to prove that perturbation theory in this case is meaningful ( i.e. asymptotic ) , using the fact that the coupling is weak to control the cluster expansion .    in a previous paper [ p ]",
    "this single slice analysis was performed in two dimensions .",
    "in that situation the main problem consists in perturbing the identity matrix by a random matrix with independent coefficients , and this problem can be controlled using e.g. the asymptotics to the wigner s law for the density of eigenvalues of this kind of matrices .    in three dimensions the analogous problem is more difficult since the matrix no longer has independent random entries .",
    "it belongs to this new class of random matrices alluded above , for which large size asymptotics are not known . in this paper",
    "we initiate the study of such matrices by large deviation techniques which ultimately rely on feynman graphs estimates .",
    "we prove a theorem which states that the probability that such random matrices develop a large eigenvalue is sufficiently small , so that a single slice analysis again can be controlled .    this single slice analysis can be considered either as a step in the program to analyze by the rg method the situation where the energy lies in the middle of the conduction band , or as a full result in its own right , but for an energy out of the conduction band and close to its border . in this last case",
    "our probabilistic bounds imply via a cluster expansion that the averaged green s function has fast decay ( for a @xmath5 band cutoff , this decay is polynomial of arbitrarily high order ) , and that it is asymptotic to its perturbative expansion .",
    "we consider an electron in a weak random potential in three dimensions .",
    "the mass of the electron is set to @xmath6 so that in these units the ordinary kinetic energy in fourier space is simply @xmath7 . to model a conduction band , we consider a free hamiltonian @xmath8 which is simply a multiplication operator in fourier space : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is some rotation invariant @xmath11 function which is 1 on a certain interval @xmath12 $ ] and zero on an interval @xmath13 $ ] , with @xmath14 .",
    "therefore in this model @xmath8 , the energy , is both infinite for large momenta @xmath15 and for small momenta ( @xmath16 ) , so there is both an ultraviolet cutoff , as should be the case for any non - relativistic problem , and an infrared cutoff on small momenta .",
    "lattice cutoffs could also be treated by our methods , replacing for instance the function @xmath7 by @xmath17 ( hence they are not rotation invariant ) .",
    "the interacting hamiltonian is obtained by adding to @xmath8 a random potential @xmath18 : @xmath19 we take @xmath18 as a gaussian ultra - local field in @xmath20-space , _ i.e. _ each @xmath21 is an independent gaussian variable .",
    "more precisely , it means that @xmath18 is distributed according to a normalized gaussian measure @xmath22 of covariance @xmath23 .",
    "we also include a volume cutoff : this means that we choose a large box @xmath24 of volume @xmath25 and side size @xmath26 , and restrict the operator @xmath18 to that box .",
    "we can also use e.g. periodic boundary conditions for the operator @xmath8 on the boundary @xmath27 ( although this last condition is not essential ) . in that case",
    "the fourier - transform of a @xmath24-periodic function @xmath28 is @xmath29 and verifies @xmath30    we are interested in computing the averaged green s function at energy @xmath31 ( with a feynman prescription ) as a kernel in @xmath20-space , or the density of states , which is the imaginary part of this kernel at coinciding points .",
    "therefore we want to analyze @xmath32 @xmath33 in the following we will note @xmath34 for integration with respect to @xmath18 , and @xmath35 for the probability of an event , measured with respect to @xmath22 .    it is important to remark that we can put some kind of ultraviolet cutoff on the random potential @xmath18 as well , because we are treating a non - relativistic problem .",
    "usually this is done by considering the potential on a lattice , but we can also choose to stay in the continuum and to take the covariance @xmath23 of @xmath18 not to be a @xmath36 distribution but a smooth positive type kernel with compact support or fast decay at the unit scale ( the scale of our ultra - violet cutoff ) .      in the standard anderson model at weak coupling in dimension 3 the first significant open mathematical problem is to prove that for a conduction band of finite width and an energy @xmath31 inside the band ( that is @xmath37)$ ] the thermodynamic limit of green s functions defined above exist and has fast decay ( exponential decay in the case of the lattice cutoff ) for real small enough coupling @xmath38 .",
    "one want also to prove that the decay rate behaves , as a function of the coupling , as : @xmath39    all these conjectures stem from the well - known perturbative analysis of the model .",
    "it is based on expanding ( 6 ) as a power series in @xmath38 ( resolvent expansion ) , then integrating on @xmath18 .",
    "this perturbative analysis is of course plagued by the usual divergence of perturbation theory .    to obtain the leading behavior @xmath40 , it is sufficient to compute a self - consistent renormalization of the divergent tadpole graph , which leads to :    @xmath41 so that @xmath42 this equation gives the behavior ( 7 ) since @xmath31 belongs to @xmath12 $ ] , where the cutoff @xmath10 is 1 .",
    "this self - consistent computation is the so - called `` rainbow graphs '' approximation .",
    "thus the first main effect of @xmath18 is to add a mass term in @xmath43 which screens the singularity of the free propagator @xmath44 .",
    "physically this means that the electron wave function loses memory of its phase by the incoherent reflections on @xmath18 .",
    "to prove this fast decay of @xmath45 or equivalently to analyze the behavior at small @xmath38 of the density of states is our first natural goal in the small coupling analysis of the anderson model .",
    "remark however that this result would still fail to distinguish between @xmath46 or the existence of @xmath47 @xmath48 , which can be distinguished only by the decay properties of @xmath49 .",
    "let us recall that in the localization regime ( which in @xmath1 means for @xmath38 large ) the function @xmath50 decays exponentially , whether in the diffusive or extended states regime ( which in @xmath1 should exist for @xmath38 small ) , it is conjectured that the function @xmath50 decays only as @xmath51 . to distinguish rigorously between these two regimes at @xmath1 ,",
    "hence to establish the existence of the mott - anderson transition is the long term goal for our program .",
    "here we do not even prove yet this fast decay of @xmath45 when @xmath31 is inside the band , but establish a weaker result .",
    "we consider an energy @xmath31 not inside the band but near its edge .",
    "also the coupling constant @xmath52 is taken real and small enough so that both the width of the band @xmath53 and the distance between the energy and the border of the band ( say , @xmath54 for an energy close to the _ lower _ edge of the band ) are large compared to @xmath55 . under these conditions",
    "we shall prove that the averaged green s function has fast decay on a spatial scale of order @xmath56 , where @xmath57 .",
    "more precisely we can state the :    * theorem i * _ let @xmath57 .",
    "there exists some small constant @xmath58 such that if @xmath59 , then @xmath45 exist ( the convergence of its kernel as @xmath60 and @xmath61 being uniform on all compact sets ) and for all integer @xmath62 there exists a constant @xmath63 such that : @xmath64 furthermore this averaged green s function is asymptotic to all orders its perturbative expansion in @xmath38 .",
    "this expansion is obtained by expanding the resolvent ( see ( 19 ) below ) and performing the gaussian integration on @xmath18 in @xmath65 . _",
    "this result in @xmath0 is essentially the subject of [ p ] .",
    "the purpose of these notes is to extend it to @xmath1 , and explain the difference .",
    "the proof combines two aspects , a large / small field probabilistic analysis which is given here in detail , and a cluster expansion which is a rather standard method ( [ r][p ] ) , so not repeated here .",
    "the same result can be proved to hold also for a band width no longer small but finite , of order 1 , the distance of the energy to the border of the band being still small ( hence @xmath66 ) ; since the proof is technically slightly more difficult , we do not include it here .",
    "finally the much more difficult problem of an energy _ within _ the band , is somewhat analogous to spontaneous mass generation in field theory or in the bcs theory .",
    "our result which concerns the energy outside the band is nevertheless a relevant step towards this more difficult result , since one can expect to analyze the case of the energy inside the band by cutting slices closer and closer to it , as in a renormalization group analysis [ p]-[ft ] .",
    "we must however add that the situation is quite different in dimensions 2 and 3 . in two dimensions we have a precise scenario in progress to solve this problem of an energy within the band , using the specific two dimensional rules of conservation of momentum [ mpr ] . in three dimensions we have",
    "not yet such a precise scenario on how to attack the problem of an energy within the band .",
    "we can make an _ a priori _ partial renormalization and generate a non vanishing imaginary part in the denominator thanks to a complex translation of the integration contour of @xmath18 , using the formulas @xmath68 @xmath69 these formulas are easily proved for @xmath70 polynomial and then extended with a density argument to meromorphic functions provided we meet no pole .",
    "let us translate @xmath18 by @xmath71 , and get :    @xmath72 ( the exact value of @xmath36 will be fixed later on ) .",
    "now we can take the limit @xmath73 which yields @xmath74 on the lattice this formula is exact but in the continuum it has to be slightly corrected to take into account the ultraviolet cutoff on @xmath18 , but this is inessential [ p ] .    the cost of this operation is the bad factor @xmath75 that we may have to compensate if some absolute value in the bounds cancels the oscillating term @xmath76 .",
    "however let us explain the strategy : space will be divided into so - called large / small field regions . in the small field regions ,",
    "perturbation theory works .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath77 are too small to cancel @xmath78 .",
    "therefore the imaginary term @xmath79 is not really needed and the complex translation can be reversed , so that the bad factor has not to be compensated . in the large field region",
    ", this is no longer true , but the bad factor is more than compensated by the probabilistic factor associated to the measure @xmath22 which is very small .      from now on the number @xmath80 is chosen of the form @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is some fixed number and @xmath83 a large positive integer .",
    "these are the usual notations which come from the renormalization group point of view [ ft],[fmrt][p ] .",
    "we also set @xmath84 for simplicity .",
    "let us also define @xmath85^{3}$ ] ( the subscript @xmath83 simply recalls that the width of the support of the function @xmath10 is @xmath86 ) .",
    "we introduce the free green s function @xmath87 where @xmath88 then we can factorize @xmath89 and rewrite @xmath90 as @xmath91 @xmath92 where we used the operator product conventions @xmath93 @xmath94 where @xmath95    because of its smooth covariance @xmath18 is almost surely bounded .",
    "thus for a given @xmath18 , @xmath96 is analytic in @xmath38 in a small domain around the real axis .",
    "this implies that @xmath97 is the unique analytic continuation of the operator series @xmath98 @xmath99",
    "we want to study @xmath90 by means of a _ phase space analysis_. in order to do so , we will cut the propagator @xmath89 according to cells ( called sectors ) in the space of angular coordinates of the momentum @xmath100 ( see subsection below ) .",
    "these sectors are also the main tool in the constructive renormalization group analysis of [ fmrt1 - 4 ] .",
    "space will also be cut according to a lattice of cubes of size @xmath101 , which is adapted to the decay of the propagator , or of the cutoff @xmath102 . in momentum space @xmath18 ,",
    "seen as an operator , is @xmath103 .",
    "* figure 1 *    the key difference between the constructive or phase space analysis in 2 and 3 dimensions is that in two dimensions when @xmath104 and @xmath105 have the same fixed norm ( here close to @xmath84 , since @xmath106 ) , the sum @xmath107 defines in a unique way the pair @xmath108 , whether in three dimensions it defines it only up to a rotation by an angle ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "the operator @xmath18 can be considered as a matrix whose entries are labeled by this discrete set of sector indices . in this point of view",
    ", the geometrical behavior depicted in figure 1 translates essentially in the following property : the matrix obtained in @xmath0 is approximately an orthogonal ensemble with wigner s semi - circle law as asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues density [ p ] , whether in three dimensions the matrix is of a constrained type , and the asymptotic distribution for the eigenvalues can be probed only more indirectly , for instance , as will be shown below , through large order deviations which amount to the computation of particular feynman graphs .",
    "we go on to make now this statement more precise .",
    "the usual point of view in localization theory is to treat space as fundamental and to expand the off diagonal part of @xmath89 , which couples different points .",
    "but for diffusion theory and extended states regimes , it is better to keep momentum space as fundamental .",
    "since @xmath89 is a diagonal operator in momentum space , the important part of the problem is to understand the behavior of the random operator @xmath109 in momentum space .",
    "we show now how to discretize this operator as a matrix to understand better its qualitative behavior .    from now on we restrict ourselves to dimension",
    "suppose that we cut the momentum shell support of the cutoff @xmath102 into cells @xmath110 ( isotropic sectors ) which have size @xmath86 in all directions : @xmath111 .",
    "there will be roughly @xmath112 such sectors ( neglecting factors such as @xmath113 ) .",
    "consider the covariance @xmath23 of @xmath18 . since @xmath18 is almost ultralocal ,",
    "this covariance is almost 1 on a ball of large radius .",
    "but by momentum conservation , the operator @xmath114 is zero unless the momentum of @xmath18 , which should be approximately @xmath115 , lies inside the ball of radius @xmath116 , so approximately the ball of radius 2 . in this ball",
    "@xmath117 with a very good approximation . cut the interior of this three dimensional ball of radius 2 into about @xmath118 cells @xmath119 of side size @xmath86 : @xmath120 .",
    "there will be an associated decomposition of @xmath18 as a sum of random variables @xmath121 , each independent and distributed with covariance @xmath122 .",
    "when this decomposition of momentum space both for the electron cutoff @xmath102 and for @xmath18 has been made with smooth @xmath11 functions , there is fast dual spatial decay of the propagators @xmath123 and @xmath122 on length scales @xmath124 .",
    "therefore the heart of the theory is given by the problem restricted to a single spatial cube of side size @xmath124 .",
    "to understand this single cube theory we can neglect now the space dependence of @xmath123 and @xmath122 , keeping only the constraint of momentum conservation .    in this approximation the different random variables @xmath121 ( which are no longer fields but real random variables ) become identically distributed",
    "the matrix @xmath109 has now @xmath125 entries , namely all pairs @xmath126 where @xmath110 and @xmath127 are isotropic sectors .",
    "we understand that since this @xmath128 by @xmath128 matrix depends on @xmath129 independent variables only , it can not be of the free type usually considered in theoretical physics ( orthogonal , hermitian or symplectic ensemble ) .",
    "it is of a new _ constrained _ type , and the constraints stem from the geometry of momentum addition on the singular manifold ( here the sphere ) .",
    "these constraints are related to the absence , in dimension 3 or more , of conservation rules for diffusion and of completely integrable models . because of these constraints , the matrices obtained are not invariant under a group such as the orthogonal , unitary and symplectic group ; the statistics do no longer factorize and reduce to eigenvalue statistics ( namely there are `` preferred eigenvectors '' as well ) , orthogonal polynomial methods do not apply , etc ... , and nothing seems to be known up to now about such matrices .    these matrices can nevertheless be described and studied numerically on a computer very easily with the following program ( here we simplified again slightly the initial problem , which involved complex matrices , replacing it by an analogous real problem with sums of momenta instead of differences ) :    take a small number @xmath81 . divide the unit sphere into @xmath130 sectors of approximately similar area @xmath131 .",
    "divide the ball of radius two into @xmath132 cubic cells of volume approximately @xmath133 .",
    "generate with a random number generator @xmath129 independent random variables @xmath121 , one for each cell of the ball .",
    "associate to any pair of sectors @xmath126 the unique cell @xmath134 such that the sum of the two momenta at the center of @xmath135 and @xmath136 fall into the cell @xmath119 , and plug the corresponding variable @xmath137 at the corresponding entry of the matrix , that is consider the ( real symmetric ) @xmath128 by @xmath128 matrix @xmath138 . diagonalize it , plot the eigenvalues , and repeat the operation a lot of times to get some statistics .",
    "we have implemented this program and run it on a computer for @xmath128 up to about 600 [ g. poirot , unpublished ] .",
    "we can not yet predict clearly scaling laws or tail estimates from this numerical study , but the results indicate that the eigenvalue distribution is differently peaked and extends more towards large eigenvalues that in the free case .",
    "this is not surprising , since constraints typically increase both the degeneracy hence the small eigenvalues of a matrix , and allow for larger exceptional eigenvalues .",
    "for instance the completely constrained matrix with the same random value at every entry has @xmath139 eigenvalues 0 , and a single large eigenvalue of size @xmath128 .",
    "we close this parenthesis on this simple discretization of the random matrix model , and return now to the true problem which is complicated by spatial dependence .",
    "for this true problem one gets better bounds by considering angular sectors , called _ anisotropic _ , which are wider in the tangential than in the radial directions [ fmrt1 ] .",
    "we introduce now these sectors and the precise tools to prove theorem i below .",
    "we noticed that the cutoff @xmath102 implies the condition : @xmath140    we construct a partition of the unit sphere into anisotropic sectors [ fmrt2 ] @xmath141 , by projecting e.g. a standard division of the faces of the cube @xmath142^{3}$ ] into @xmath143 square plaquettes of side @xmath144 , hence area @xmath86 , onto the sphere .",
    "this gives a sharp partition of the sphere into @xmath145 `` spherical plaquettes '' or sectors @xmath146 of variable area ( between @xmath86 and @xmath147 , since the maximal distance of the cube to the origin is @xmath148 ) .",
    "we call @xmath149 the center of mass of @xmath146 . from this sharp partition",
    "one can build an associated smooth @xmath150 scaled partition of unity @xmath151 on the sphere with urisohn s lemma .",
    "finally we transport this partition into a partition of the support of the cutoff @xmath102 by writing : @xmath152 where @xmath153 .    the support @xmath141 of a sector @xmath146 , or of an @xmath154 function ,",
    "is therefore included in a parallelepipedic slab , of center @xmath149 , which has small thickness @xmath155 in the direction parallel to @xmath149 and which is longer in the two other perpendicular directions where it has length @xmath156 .",
    "the cube and our sector partition is invariant under parity : @xmath157 .",
    "therefore for any sector @xmath146 with center of mass @xmath149 we can define the antipodal sector @xmath158 .",
    "all other sectors have support at distance at least say @xmath159 of the antipod center @xmath160 , if the partition of unity @xmath161 does not spread too much onto the nearest neighbors , a fact we can assume from now on .",
    "then if @xmath162 , we define    @xmath163    where @xmath164 is half the angle @xmath165 ( modulo @xmath166 ) between @xmath149 and @xmath167 , so @xmath168 , and @xmath169 is a well defined unit vector .",
    "it is natural to consider a smooth partition of the space by a lattice @xmath170 of cubes @xmath171 of side @xmath124 , with @xmath172 `` characteristic functions '' @xmath173 .",

    "let us repeat that because we are in dimension @xmath1 , the operator @xmath109 localized in a box , considered as a matrix whose entries are the sectors of ingoing and outgoing momenta , does not , even approximately , look like a classical ensemble such as the orthogonal or hermitian ensembles of random matrices which appeared in dimension 2 [ p ] .",
    "so wigner s semi - circle law and the usual asymptotics do not apply to this problem .",
    "we must use a different , less accurate , method to bound the tail of the distribution , namely the probability that some eigenvalue becomes large .            recall that for a compact symmetric trace class operator such as @xmath109 ( it is easily proved trace class because of the cutoffs ) , the ordinary norm is bounded by @xmath190 for any positive integer @xmath191 . therefore      performing the gaussian integration",

    "we obtain our general bound for a graph of order @xmath221 , taking into account the fact that each half vertex joins successively @xmath171 , @xmath222 and @xmath223 or @xmath223 , @xmath224 and @xmath171 :    @xmath225 @xmath226 @xmath227^{q } } \\ ] ] @xmath228^{q } \\left[1+m^{-2j } \\mbox{d}^{2}_{\\alpha_{l , /\\!/}}(x_{l},y_{l})\\right]^{q}}\\ ] ] @xmath229^{q } }   \\ .\\ ] ] where the sum runs over attributions of sectors to the lines , and spatial integrations over the vertices have been performed , except at one point per vertex .",
    "now by a combinatoric factor 2 per vertex we can decide if there exists at each vertex a sum or a difference between two incident sectors which is small in the sense that @xmath230 .",
    "@xmath231 is some small number that we will fix later to @xmath232 . in this way we cut the amplitude @xmath198 in @xmath233 elements as @xmath234 , where the sum over @xmath235 runs over the choices at each vertex whether there is or not such a small sum or difference .",
    "vertices such that there is no such small sum or difference are called `` twisted '' or non planar .",
    "the vertices with such a small difference are called `` untwisted '' since their four momenta typically will lie approximately in a common plane , or otherwise the vertex factor in ( 31 ) will be very small .",
    "the number of twisted vertices is called @xmath236 , and the number of untwisted vertices is @xmath237 , with @xmath238 .",
    "now for each `` untwisted vertex '' , we choose the particular pair of momenta realizing the smallest sum or difference ( or an arbitrary one if several pair realize this minimum ) and we split the vertex into two half vertices and an intermediate wavy line according to this splitting .",
    "the graph has then @xmath236 quartic vertices and @xmath237 pairs of trilinear vertices .",
    "then we cut all the corresponding wavy lines .",
    "the graph splits then into @xmath119 `` ordinary '' connected components which contain at least one twisted vertex , plus possibly other twisted vertices and chains of untwisted half vertices , and into @xmath239 pure `` cycles '' of untwisted half vertices , with @xmath240 .",
    "the result of this splitting process is pictured in figure 3 , for a graph with 15 vertices , 8 of which are untwisted and seven twisted .",
    "it splits into @xmath241 connected components if the wavy lines ( untwisted vertices ) are removed .",
    "we have @xmath242 of these 5 components which are cycles which do not contain twisted vertices .",
    "we select a tree of wavy lines relating together all these components , and will perform the spatial integration and attribution of momentum sectors according to what we call `` painting rules '' for each connected components .",
    "the tree of wavy lines is ordered by chosing a particular root , which correspond to a special connected component @xmath243 ( either ordinary or cycle ) .",
    "the standard weight for integration of a vertex with the help of a single propagator hooked to it is the volume of a tube of size @xmath199 in the two perpendicular directions to a sector , and @xmath124 in the parallel direction , hence it is @xmath128 .",
    "however if the vertex is _ twisted _ and integrated by taking into account the decay of two propagators hooked to it , remark that the corresponding weight is at most @xmath244 , since we gain the fact that the integration is located at the intersection of two tubes who make an angle at least @xmath245 .",
    "finally there is one single vertex in the root component whose integration costs the full volume of @xmath246 , hence @xmath247 .",
    "now let us perform momentum attributions and vertex integrations .",
    "we perform these attributions in an order induced from the tree chosen and from fixing rules associated to each connected components .",
    "let @xmath248 be pure cycles of @xmath249 untwisted half vertices .",
    "let @xmath250 be the number of such half - vertices whose other half vertex is not yet fixed in the process ( i.e. is lower in the tree ) .",
    "we have @xmath251 , except possibly for the last cycle @xmath243 if it is the root of the tree .",
    "then the first sector attribution to a line of @xmath248 is made on a half vertex of the type @xmath250 ( except possibly if @xmath252 ) .",
    "it costs @xmath253 ( total number of sectors ) .",
    "each next attribution costs either @xmath254 ( number of sectors in the cone of opening angle @xmath245 ) , or @xmath255 , depending whether the sectors of the other half vertex to which this half vertex is associated has been already attributed or not .",
    "so the total factor is @xmath256 , except possibly for @xmath252 , where it can be @xmath253 if @xmath257 , so there is an extra @xmath254 in that case , with respect to the formula @xmath258 .",
    "finally it remains to attribute the momenta in the ordinary components .",
    "let us contract the chains of untwisted vertices to single lines ( but with an index @xmath104 for the number of insertions of half untwisted vertices , and an index @xmath80 for the number of such insertions whose other half vertex is not yet fixed ) .",
    "fixing all the sectors of such a line is like fixing one of them at the end , plus a factor @xmath259 .    to complete the bound , it remains therefore to compute the weight of fixing sectors in a vacuum connected @xmath196 graph solely made of _ twisted _ vertices .",
    "let @xmath260 be such a graph , and @xmath261 its number of vertices .",
    "a fixing rule @xmath262 on @xmath260 is an ordering of the vertices of @xmath260 as @xmath263 such that for every @xmath264 there exists a line hooked at one end to @xmath265 and at the other end to one vertex among @xmath266 .",
    "there always obviously exist such fixing rules .",
    "for instance to any tree @xmath267 of @xmath90 and any way of `` turning around the tree '' ( i.e. choice of a root and relative ordering of the non trivial forks going up in the tree ) is associated a fixing rule corresponding to the ordering in which vertices of @xmath90 are met by `` climbing around the tree '' in that way .",
    "the @xmath268-th vertex @xmath265 for the fixing rule @xmath262 is called of type 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 or 0 with respect to @xmath262 if the number of half lines hooked at one end to @xmath265 and at the other end to a vertex not among @xmath266 is 4,3,2,1 , or 0 .",
    "the number of vertices of type @xmath80 is called @xmath269 .",
    "obviously @xmath270 , and @xmath271 since the first vertex of the fixing rule is the only one of type 4 .    to perform the sum over the values of sectors in the graph we fix first the indices of vertex @xmath272 , which is the only one of type 4",
    "this costs @xmath273",
    ". then vertices of type 3 cost @xmath274 .",
    "vertices of type 2 cost @xmath275 , because they are twisted .",
    "vertices of type 1 or zero cost nothing .",
    "finally we should take into account the fact that because of the twisting , vertices of type 2,1 or 0 , when integrated , are integrated with the decay of two propagators whose sectors are known and have a minimum angle .",
    "this allows a gain of @xmath276 , as explained above , for the spatial integration of these vertices .",
    "collecting all factors , the key point is to remark that the factors @xmath277 and @xmath278 combine into @xmath279 , since one of the two half vertices of any untwisted vertex is always fixed before the other . adding the extra @xmath254 eventual factor for @xmath243",
    ", we arrive at the following estimate , where we recall that @xmath237 is the total number of untwisted vertices :        @xmath289 @xmath290 @xmath291 from the fact that there is a tree of untwisted `` wavy lines '' between the connected components of type @xmath119 and @xmath239 , we know that @xmath292 .",
    "therefore @xmath293 @xmath294 choosing a=1/16 , we have : @xmath293 @xmath295      now we consider the following reduction process .",
    "we contract a certain number @xmath303 of pure cycles in the following inductive way : first we contract every tadpole ( pure cycle with @xmath304 ) , i.e. suppress it together with one of the two external lines hooked to the tadpole .",
    "then we repeat this operation inductively ( since the contraction at first stage can create new tadpoles ) , until complete exhaustion . in the case of the graph of figure 3",
    ", there is a single tadpole so the operation stops after one step , but in general it can be more complicated ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "let @xmath305 be the number of cycles contracted in this way .",
    "this contraction process continues until either we arrive at the empty graph because at some stage we obtained a graph with @xmath306 made of two tadpoles , which we then delete or until we arrive at a graph with @xmath307 cycles without any tadpole . in this last case",
    "either the graph is a pure loop of @xmath308 bubbles that we destroy ( see figure 5 ) , or it is not . in this second case",
    ", the graph may still contain pure bubbles , i.e. loops without twisted vertices of length 2 .",
    "for instance in the case of the graph of figure 3 , after contraction of the tadpole , there is one such bubble which appears .",
    "we perform then a second operation of contraction , which contracts every maximal chain of such bubbles ( pure cycles of length 2 without twisted vertices ) to a single new type of wavy line .",
    "this second operation has not to be repeated inductively in contrast with the first , since it can not regenerate any bubble ( see figure 6 ) .",
    "( wavy lines have been omitted in figure 4 - 5 - 6 for simpler pictures ) .",
    "proof : obviously each contracted cycle can be associated to a new 4 point subgraph in a forest , except if @xmath313 , in which case when one destroys the two tadpoles there is no new 4-point subgraph associated , or when one destroys the loop of @xmath268 bubbles , there is only @xmath314 corresponding 4-point subgraphs in a forest .",
    "this two cases are exclusive , which explains the 2 in the lemma .",
    "* lemma 3 ( particular case of [ cr ] , theorem ii ) * _ the number of wick contractions of half - vertices giving rise to a vacuum connected graph with @xmath191 vertices and @xmath316 , is bounded by @xmath317 , for some constant @xmath318 . _",
    "if @xmath326 is larger than @xmath89 , we obtain easily the bound ( 32 ) of the theorem ( since @xmath327 , @xmath328 being large and @xmath329 , and we can also choose @xmath328 such that @xmath330 ) .",
    "we have therefore in that case :      in order to obtain a theorem no longer on @xmath109 but on the full operator @xmath332 that occurs in our resolvent expansions , we need to add to the estimate of theorem i the power counting coming from the coupling constant and the norm of the propagator . this adds a factor @xmath333 to the norm of @xmath109 .",
    "the factor @xmath58 comes from the distance to the last slice , since recall that in section 3 we assumed that @xmath334 .",
    "finally we obtain , taking @xmath335 small , the following estimate :          to complete the proof of theorem i , one combines the estimate of theorem iii with a large versus small field cluster expansion .",
    "this expansion is exactly similar to the one of [ p ] , to which we refer the reader .",
    "the decay factor @xmath338 is roughly speaking needed to sum the various triplets @xmath339 with respect to one of their elements , and the factor @xmath340 is sufficient to compensate the bad factors due to the imaginary translation ( see ( 13 ) ) which come from the estimation of the resolvent in the large field regions .",
