    "unlike in the linear regime of light - matter interaction , the response of an atom or a molecule to an intense external field depends profoundly on the field parameters . following",
    "the theoretical predictions of l. v. keldysh in 1965@xcite , significant developments in laser technologies have enabled researchers to observe tunnel ionization using strong infrared ( ir ) laser fields . when an intense ir field is applied to an atom or a molecule",
    "it distorts the system by forming a potential barrier through which a bound electron can tunnel out .",
    "the subsequent dynamics of the laser - driven electron wave packet in the continuum can be described by the so - called three - step mechanism introduced by p. b. corkum in 1993@xcite .",
    "after its release in the continuum , the electron , following the field , will scatter from the ionic core .",
    "this process is known as recollision .",
    "the particular case of elastic recollision is popularly known as _ laser induced electron diffraction _ , or lied@xcite .",
    "this strong field effect and its acronym were first thought of by a. d. bandrauk and coworkers . in 1996 ,",
    "t. zuo , a. d. bandrauk and p. b. corkum suggested that this laser - induced diffraction process could be used to study the dynamics of molecular systems and to access structural information about molecules @xcite .",
    "these predictions were first demonstrated experimentally in 2008@xcite . since then , several theoretical and experimental lied related studies were performed in order to image time - resolved dynamics of molecular systems@xcite .",
    "closely related to lied is the attosecond photoelectron holography imaging idea , again pioneered by a. d. bandrauk and coworkers@xcite .",
    "a breakthrough was achieved for imaging molecular orbitals in 2004 using a tomographic technique based on the measurement of high harmonics ( hhg ) generated by inelastic recollision events@xcite .",
    "hhg based tomographic techniques are relatively complex but they provide accurate results for the reconstruction of molecular orbitals .",
    "we have shown recently that lied also has the potential to be developed into such an imaging tool . indeed , drawing the connection with optical diffraction , lied photoelectron spectra can be seen as an image of the scattering centers in the reciprocal space . inverting the lied spectrum of a molecule back to real space ,",
    "should thus allow to obtain an image of the scattering centers , and therefore of the molecule itself .",
    "we have demonstrated that it is possible to invert the diffraction patterns of lied spectra obtained from the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) of co@xmath0@xcite . in the homo ,",
    "only two oxygen atoms of the molecule contribute to the ionization signal .",
    "the inversion problem is more involved when all atoms of the molecule contribute . in this paper , we present such a case where all the atoms of a linear molecule have significant contributions , using the homo-1 orbital of co@xmath0 as an example .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : theo ] we describe the theoretical models used in this study .",
    "this section presents both the numerical and analytical approaches we have developed .",
    "section [ sec : reconst ] discusses the extraction of information about the molecule from the lied spectra of the homo-1 orbital of co@xmath0 .",
    "the reconstruction procedure is discussed in detail in this section .",
    "finally in section [ sec : conclude ] , we conclude our work .",
    "note that atomic units are used throughout the paper unless stated otherwise .",
    "the aim of this paper is to extend the inverse problem for imaging molecular orbitals we discussed in ref.@xcite to the cases where the initial state has a different symmetry and shape compared to the homo of co@xmath1 .",
    "the system considered in ref.@xcite is a symmetric , linear , carbon dioxide molecule , co@xmath0 coupled to an intense ir field .",
    "the problem was discussed in detail for the lied spectra extracted from the homo orbital which is mainly localized , in an anti - symmetric manner , on the two oxygen atoms of the molecule@xcite . unlike the homo ,",
    "the homo-1 of the co@xmath0 molecule is a symmetric orbital delocalized over all atoms , as shown in fig.[fig : system](b ) .",
    "hence during tunnel ionization all atoms of the molecule will play a significant role .",
    "this particular structure of the homo-1 orbital should imprint its signature in the associated lied spectra .",
    "the homo-1 of co@xmath0 is therefore an ideal candidate for the present work discussing other symmetries as compared to the anti - symmetric homo .",

    "the strong field electronic dynamics is triggered by an intense ir laser field .",
    "the molecule with symmetric c - o bond length @xmath3 is assumed to be pre - aligned along the @xmath4-axis , normal to both the polarization ( @xmath5-axis ) and propagation ( @xmath6-axis ) directions of the applied intense ir field .",
    "this arrangement will mainly confine tunnel ionization and the associated electron dynamics in the plane @xmath7 defined by the field polarization and the molecular alignment axes .",
    "this 2d dynamics simplifies our problem significantly .",
    "the dynamics of the system can then be simulated using an appropriate method , as explained hereafter .",
    "other cases where the applied field is acting at an angle @xmath8 with respect to the molecular axis will be discussed in our following paper of this issue@xcite .",
    "this additional paper discusses the robustness of the lied spectra with respect to the initial alignment of the molecule .",
    "note that , as long as the field is resolved such that the molecular axis and polarization directions are coplanar vectors , the field driven electron dynamics will always be confined into that plane .",
    "the dynamics of the system obeys the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) given ( in atomic units ) by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the state of the system coupled to the field and @xmath11 stands for the total hamiltonian @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the field - free hamiltonian and @xmath14 is the interaction potential taken in the length gauge .",

    "@xmath18 is the ir carrier frequency and @xmath19 is the electric field amplitude .",
    "@xmath20 is the carrier - envelop phase ( cep ) and @xmath21 is the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the sine - squared pulse envelop . the binding potential @xmath22 is taken as an effective soft - coulomb potential modeled within the single active electron approximation ( sae)@xcite , as introduced initially in ref.@xcite .",
    "the sae approximation and the specific geometry we have chosen ( see fig.[fig : system](a ) ) reduce the dynamics to a 2d problem , the transverse dynamics along @xmath6 being limited to a simple spreading effect .",
    "the 2d dynamics is solved numerically using the second - order split - operator method@xcite on a spatial grid with @xmath23a.u . and 1024 grid points in each direction .",
    "the initial state is calculated using the imaginary time propagation ( itp ) technique@xcite .",
    "if the time step @xmath24 used for the itp is too large , it leads to inaccuracies in the calculated state . in order to avoid such problems we use the following strategy : once convergence in energy",
    "is achieved for a given @xmath25 , the wave function is further propagated using itp with a smaller time step .",
    "this procedure is repeated until the wave function is relaxed to a state which is unaffected by any further decrease in @xmath25 .",
    "once this initial state is calculated , the dynamics is solved by propagating the wave function in real time using the method discussed by s. chelkowski and a. d. bandrauk in ref.@xcite .    in principle",
    ", the state of the system defined by @xmath10 should describe both the electronic and nuclear dynamics . in order to simplify our model",

    "panel ( a ) is for an internuclear distance @xmath3 of 1.5 , panel ( b ) is for @xmath36 and panel ( c ) shows the same for @xmath37 .",
    "the key features of typical lied spectra from the homo have been discussed already in ref.@xcite .",
    "the main difference between the lied spectra shown in fig.[fig:2d_ph_spectra ] and the one for the homo is the variation in intensities between successive interference fringes@xcite .",
    "another notable difference is the fact that the spectra are characterized by a maximum for the momentum @xmath38 ( @xmath4 being the direction of the internuclear axis ) , whereas this point is a zero ( it corresponds to a nodal plane ) of the spectrum associated with the homo .    it has been shown that it is much easier to study averaged 1d - photoelectron spectra @xmath39 obtained by averaging out @xmath32 over the momentum @xmath40 parallel to the polarization axis@xcite , using @xmath41 the most interesting feature of these spectra lie in the interference patterns along this parallel momentum axis @xmath42 .",
    "it was shown in ref.@xcite that the fringe width associated with these structures can be related , in the case of the homo , to the internuclear distance @xmath3 via the relation",
    "@xmath43    fig.[fig:1d_ph_spectra ] shows such 1d - spectra in log scale obtained from averaging the 2d - spectra shown in fig.[fig:2d_ph_spectra ] .",
    "each of the panels labeled ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) corresponds to the one of fig.[fig:2d_ph_spectra ] bearing the same label .",
    "in contrast with the simple spectra obtained in the case of the homo@xcite , the 1d averaged photoelectron spectra from the homo-1 are characterized by a regular succession of two peaks with different amplitudes@xcite . these peaks are marked with long - red and short - green arrows in fig.[fig:1d_ph_spectra ] , and these different successive peaks are characterized by the period @xmath44     associated with the 2d spectra shown in fig.[fig:2d_ph_spectra ] , in log scale . the panels ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) are for @xmath31 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "all other parameters are as in fig.[fig:2d_ph_spectra].,scaledwidth=95.0% ]    the peaks in the spectra are due to the interference of electron wave packets ionized and scattered from the three different ionic centers .",
    "these spectra , hence , imprint all essential information for imaging the molecular orbital from which these electrons were ionized .",
    "these interference patterns can resist misalignment defects .",
    "this case is discussed in detail in ref@xcite .",
    "reading this information is not easy since it is encoded in the spectra in a complicated way .",
    "it thus requires the development of a model describing the electronic dynamics of the system such that it can potentially reproduce all the features of the spectra .",
    "we will discuss such a simple analytical model in the following subsection .",
    "we show here how to invert photoelectron spectrum data to obtain an image of the initial state of the system .",
    "the photoelectron spectrum is here a calculated one , but the inversion procedure is intended for use on an experimental lied spectrum leading to the full reconstruction of a molecular orbital of a triatomic , symmetric molecule such as co@xmath1 .",
    "such an inversion procedure was proposed in ref.@xcite in the case of the homo . here",
    "we recall the particular points of this model that are essential for understanding our forthcoming discussion concerning the homo-1 . for a detailed description of the model , see ref.@xcite .",
    "the photoelectron spectrum is calculated by splitting @xmath45 in three parts : ( i ) the part of the wave packet that is still bound to the system ( ii ) the part describing direct ionization , and ( iii ) the part describing the recollision process .",
    "this separation can be done using the dyson equation which gives a time - ordered series expansion for the quantum evolution operator@xcite . in general , this series can be continued in order to treat all recollision orders .",
    "but it is also possible to concentrate on the first recollision event by approximating the total evolution operator using the strong field approximation ( sfa)@xcite . as a consequence of this dyson splitting , the approximate analytical photoelectron spectrum can be written as @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 represent ionization amplitudes associated with a direct process or a recolliding process@xcite .",
    "eq.([eq : trans_prob_1 ] ) shows that in general these two processes interfere for a given asymptotic electron momentum @xmath49 .",
    "it has been shown that large electron energies ( and thus small de broglie wavelengths able to resolve sub -  spatial scales ) are reached by electrons ionized around a maximum of the field@xcite .",
    "assuming that the initial ionization process occurs at an instant of time close to this maximum of the field , we obtain @xmath50 and @xmath51 where @xmath25 denotes the average time for the classical excursion of ionized wave packets in the continuum@xcite . @xmath52 and @xmath53 represent scaling parameters that will be used in the inversion procedure described in the next section .    in order to evaluate the ionization amplitudes @xmath47 and @xmath48 , and therefore the photoelectron spectrum @xmath32",
    ", we represent the initial molecular wave function in the form of a simple linear combination of @xmath54 atomic gaussian - type orbitals ( gto ) given by@xmath55 where @xmath56 is the normalization constant in 2d and @xmath57 is the gaussian exponent .",
    "this choice simplifies significantly the evaluation of the integrals ( [ eq : direct_amp_sfa1 ] ) and ( [ eq : recollision_amp_sfa1 ] ) . for the homo-1 of @xmath58 , the initial molecular wave function",
    "is taken as @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the relative weighting factor for the oxygen atoms with respect to the carbon atom , and @xmath61 denoting the translation operator by the displacement vector @xmath62 . with these assumptions ,",
    "we finally obtain @xmath63\\ , .",

    "the calculation of the recolliding amplitude @xmath64 given in eq.([eq : recollision_amp_sfa1 ] ) is more involved .",
    "indeed , the initial wave function ( [ eq : mol_orb_general ] ) is written as a sum of three different atomic orbitals .",
    "in addition , the binding potential @xmath22 seen in eq.([eq : recollision_amp_sfa1 ] ) is characterized by three attraction centers . as a consequence ,",
    "the evaluation of @xmath64 requires the calculation of nine different integrals .",
    "this is because in the homo-1 the three atoms of the molecule serve both as ionization sources and as rescattering centers .",
    "fortunately , these nine different integrals are similar .",
    "each integral corresponds to a specific ionization - recollision pathway .",
    "three of these nine different pathways are illustrated in fig.[fig : recollision_scheme ] .",
    "they correspond to the ionization from one of the atoms : here the oxygen atom labeled as o@xmath65 .",
    "on recollision , this contribution from o@xmath65 will scatter from the parent atom o@xmath65 itself ( path shown as a solid brown arrow labeled o@xmath65-o@xmath65 in this figure ) and also from its two neighbors : from the carbon atom ( shown as a dotted green arrow labeled o@xmath65-c ) as well as from the second oxygen atom ( shown as a dashed blue arrow labeled o@xmath65-o@xmath1 ) .    .",

    "the reconstruction is of relatively good quality , and the more so , the larger the internuclear distance .",
