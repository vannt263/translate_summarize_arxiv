    "if the frequency of the pump wave exceeds  @xmath3 , the positive feedback loop between @xmath2 and @xmath3 makes the system unstable within a finite interval of @xmath2 .",
    "this kind of optical bistability , stemming from `` intrinsic '' interactions in a bose gas rather than a non - linearity of a medium , has recently been observed in cavity - polariton systems.@xcite    cavity polaritons are composite bosons trapped in a cavity active layer due to the strong exciton - photon coupling.@xcite their lifetime is very small ( @xmath4@xmath5  s in gaas based microcavities ) ; yet their interaction strength provides a blueshift that exceeds the resonance width ( @xmath6 ) even at comparatively low pump densities where the system can still be considered as a weakly non - ideal gas of bosons .",
    "the steady - state intensity of the driven mode can vary over more than an order of magnitude near critical ( threshold ) values of the pump density.@xcite polariton multistability allows switching the cavity between distinct steady states those , in a general case , differ in both intensity and polarization.@xcite recently there have been reported the transitions between linear and circular as well as right- and left - circular polarization states , which proceed on the scale of picoseconds under a constantly polarized pump wave.@xcite the minimum switching time is comparable to @xmath7@xcite and the minimum size of a `` multistable cell '' is several microns.@xcite in its turn , the multistability gives rise to a spectacular row of collective phenomena in polariton physics , such as self - organized optical parametric oscillation ( opo),@xcite spin rings,@xcite threshold - like screening of surface acoustic waves,@xcite and bright polariton solitons.@xcite the combination of all - optical tunability , compactness and a high speed of transitions makes cavity - polariton systems interesting for applications in the field of digital processing .    in this work",
    "we explore the dynamics of the bistability - initiated transitions . using the gross - pitaevskii equations , we have found that a passage from the low- to high - energy state is mediated by the parametric scattering into signal / idler modes whose in - plane wave vectors differ from that of the pumped mode .",
    "such scattering , which also shows a threshold onset with increasing pump power and is known to result in opo states under pumping near the `` magic angle'',@xcite was not , however , taken into account in the studies of the multistability under normal - incidence pump.@xcite here we show that inter - mode scattering can have a drastic impact upon the multistability thresholds and duration of the transitions between steady states .",
    "the scattered modes ( `` signals '' ) are fed by the pumped mode that starts to break - up above the scattering threshold ; importantly , this process is accompanied by a growth of both the `` signal '' and pumped mode amplitudes even at constant pump power . although the growth can be arbitrarily slow in its beginning , with time it is followed by an explosive amplification of the pumped mode and a transition to the upper branch of stability .",
    "this effect is essentially collective ; it can not be reproduced within the framework of three - mode opo models with fixed `` signal '' and `` idler '' wave vectors .",
    "similar scenarios , which imply a hyperbolic growth , or a singularity being reached in a finite time , are often referred to as regimes ( or solutions ) _ with blowup_. besides various models in many areas of knowledge , they are predicted to exist in systems described by the schrdinger equation with cubic nonlinearity , also known as the gross - pitaevskii equation .",
    "if the system is conservative and the sign of the nonlinear term corresponds to _ attractive _ interaction , then singular solutions occur due to an intense self - focusing of the field.@xcite by contrast , in this work we face a qualitatively new type of blowup behavior that takes place in systems described by the gross - pitaevskii equations with ( i ) a _ repulsive _ interaction and ( ii ) allowance made for both dissipation and coherent driving .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "[ fig : kspace](c ) shows the integral intensity of scattered modes .",
    "pump intensity @xmath32 increases linearly during 50  ps and then remains constant starting from @xmath236 . in the interval @xmath237  ps , steadily correlated `` signal '' modes appear out of the noise substrate at @xmath238 [ see also fig .  [",
    "fig : steadystate](b ) , ( d ) ] .",
    "it is followed by the period of their exponential growth at a constant rate @xmath239 . during this period ( @xmath240  ps )",
    "the signals are still weak and do not provide a significant feedback to the pumped mode , yet by @xmath241  ps a slight increase in @xmath233 gets noticeable .    at @xmath242",
    "ps the system reaches threshold @xmath243 [ eq .  ( [ eq : thr-2 ] ) ] .",
    "the renormalized dispersion surface now has a wide flat area @xmath244 $ ] centered at @xmath245 .",
    "consequently , various scattering directions become permitted by the conservation lows .",
    "the scattering is `` disordered '' , the old signals go away from resonance but the new ones get out of the noise substrate and then grow quite rapidly . at @xmath246",
    "ps , sum @xmath234 is only one order of magnitude less than @xmath233 , the latter being 30% larger than in the beginning of the process at @xmath236 .",
    "finally , in the catastrophe point the field grows explosively , and the system passes onto the upper steady - state branch ( @xmath247  ps ) . henceforth the scattering to @xmath130 is no longer permitted by the conservation laws , so all the scattered modes reduce down to the noise level within the next 100  ps .",
    "the new one - mode state is stable and remains unchanged .",
    "the scenario observed is general and reproduced irrespective of the number of nodes and size of the computational grid which , however , may strongly affect the characteristic evolution times .",
    "an important parameter is the noise amplitude @xmath248 that in real systems is determined by quantum fluctuations and/or incoherent polariton states filled due to rayleigh scattering on inhomogeneities . on one hand",
    ", @xmath249 is the intensity level where the signal rises out of the noise ; thus , the larger @xmath224 , the smaller the time necessary for accumulating the critical energy in the course of a forthcoming regular increase at a given rate @xmath65 . on the other hand , in the vicinity of @xmath250 fluctuations may cause a markable extension of a period when steadily correlated signal - idler pairs get out of the noise substrate . in our example",
    "it happens in the interval @xmath251  ps and then at @xmath252  ps . to analyze fluctuations in a more tight connection to their physical origins , one should either simulate inhomogeneities and rayleigh scattering@xcite or use a probabilistic approach based on the fokker - planck equations@xcite or take account of the exciton - phonon scattering and finite - temperature effects.@xcite",
    "in this work we have found that coherently driven bose condensates with a repulsive interaction can accumulate energy , which results in blowup - like dynamical scenarios . above the threshold ( [ eq :",
    "f - thr ] ) , the inter - particle interaction converts the difference between the driving wave @xmath253 and condensate @xmath254 frequency levels into the increased field @xmath255 , so that the blue - shift of the resonance compensates the mismatch of the pump frequency .",
    "the discovered effect is expected to manifest itself in the transitions between steady states in multistable cavity - polariton systems .",
    "it should become pronounced in high-@xmath256 microcavities with small decay rates @xmath0 .",
    "the smaller @xmath0 , the wider the range of pump frequencies @xmath20 in which intra - cavity field grows with @xmath20 at a given pump power and , at the same time , the lower the threshold density at a given @xmath20 .",
    "however , there is a tradeoff between lowering the driving power and increasing the latency of the transitions .",
    "they still proceed at a comparatively weak pump but in that case they appear to be delayed in time with respect to the moment of reaching the threshold density [ fig .",
    "[ fig : kspace](b ) ] .",
    "let us emphasize that the gross - pitaevskii equation is used on the assumption of a macroscopically coherent state of the field . obviously , it can not be true at whatever @xmath257 in real finite - sized structures .",
    "however , it is definitely valid in gaas based microcavities at @xmath258 and @xmath259 and pump spot sizes of about @xmath260 m , which follows from a good agreement between modeled and measured data.@xcite note as well the possibility for the interaction strength @xmath261 to depend on @xmath262 and @xmath20 . in cavity - polariton systems , @xmath261 is determined by the exciton hopfield coefficient , so it is of no use to pump the upper ( photon - like ) polariton branch far from resonance where @xmath261 is nearly zero .",
    "next , the discussed scenario will no longer make sense if the scattering threshold @xmath79 gets greater than @xmath263 [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : steadystate](a ) ] , which happens at large @xmath262 beyond the `` magic angle '' [ that is the inflection point in @xmath264 , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : dispersion ] ) ] .",
    "finally , in this work we have neglected the spin degrees of freedom , assuming that all polaritons have just the same spin .",
    "such assumption is appropriate as long as opposite - spin polaritons interact comparatively weakly , which , in its turn , normally appears to be the case@xcite unless the pump frequency is very close to the exciton level@xcite or te / tm splitting gets noticeable at large @xmath262 or a strong spatial anisotropy involves splitting of the orthogonally polarized eigenstates even at @xmath265.@xcite    the way of experimental verification of our findings is straightforward under both cw and pulsed excitation conditions . under a cw excitation , one can track the dependence of the threshold pump density @xmath266 on frequency detuning @xmath81 at @xmath31 .",
    "if our conclusions are correct , @xmath267 at @xmath268 should grow as @xmath269 [ eq .  ( [ eq : f - thr ] ) ] instead of @xmath270 ; the cubic dependence was predicted for the case of one - mode transitions.@xcite on the other hand , the dynamics of the transitions between steady states can be observed directly with the use of pulsed excitation and time - resolved measurements on the scale of @xmath271  ps . at comparatively small pump densities the system should reveal the latency period followed by a massive redistribution of scattered modes in the far field .",
