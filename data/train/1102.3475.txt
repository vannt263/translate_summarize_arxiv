    "young solar - type f , g , and k stars provide proxies for the sun s early evolution and insight into its intense pre - main sequence and zero - age main sequence magnetic activity . in this regard ,",
    "observations of starspots and surface magnetic fields are important , as they provide the empirical basis for understanding the star s magnetic dynamo and its internal structure .",
    "differential rotation is one of the primary drivers of the dynamo process that produces magnetic fields within the sun . in the solar convection zone , differential rotation is constant down to the base of this zone in the region known as the tachocline .",
    "strong shear forces are formed at the interface between the solid - body rotation of the radiative zone and the differentially rotating convective layer .",
    "this interaction converts the poloidal magnetic field to a toroidal field .",
    "this effect is known as the `` @xmath3-effect '' . however , on young solar - type stars , the operation of the magnetic dynamo process may be occurring throughout the convective zone itself .",
    "this is known as a distributed dynamo @xcite .",
    "@xcite have investigated the link between differential rotation and effective temperature , and hence convective turnover time .",
    "they were able to fit an empirical power law to recent observations of a small sample of stars .",
    "as the temperature increases , so does the rotational shear . a small number of late f-/early g - type stars have been investigated using doppler imaging ( di ) to determine their differential rotation .",
    "hd 171488 ( v889 her ) @xcite , hd 307938 ( r58 in ic 2602 ) @xcite , hr 1817 @xcite and lq lup ( rx j1508.6 - 4423 ) @xcite have had their differential rotation determined .",
    "zeeman doppler imaging ( zdi ) @xcite enables the study of stellar magnetic fields using spectropolarimetry and offers a window into the underlying magnetic dynamo .",
    "zdi requires high signal - to - noise data as the polarisation signature is typically less than 0.1% of the total light intensity @xcite .",
    "zdi only measures the large - scale magnetic fields as small - scale magnetic fields can not be recovered as the positive and negative magnetic fields within the resolution element are likely to be cancelled out .",
    "zdi has been achieved on a small sample of single , g - type stars such as hd 171488 ( v889 her ) @xcite and hd 141943 @xcite .",
    "hd 106506 is a suitable target for di and zdi .",
    "@xcite identified this star as active while @xcite and @xcite deduced this star as being single .",
    "the high resolution spectroscopic survey of @xcite confirmed this star as a young , rapidly rotating solar - type star .",
    "they measured a rotation rate of @xmath0 80 , strong h@xmath9 chromospheric activity ( log@xmath10@xmath11@xmath12 @xmath04.2 ) , and deformation of the spectral line profiles indicating the presence of large starspots .",
    "the aim of this investigation is to map the surface of this star with a view to measuring the rotational shear on its surface and to measure and to map the magnetic field structure on the surface of this star .",
    "this is the third paper in a series that investigates the magnetic field topologies of young sun - like stars , with hd  141943 being the subject of two earlier papers @xcite .",
    "spectropolarimetry of hd 106506 was obtained using the 3.9-m anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) over an 11 night period from the 30th of march - 9th of april , 2007 .",
    "near - simultaneous bvr photometric data were obtained using the university of louisville s 50 cm telescope at the university of southern queensland s mount kent observatory ( mko ) .",
    "mko is located in southern queensland , approximately 160 km south - west of brisbane .",
    "the university of louisville 50 cm telescope at mko is a corrected dall - kirkham design manufactured by planewave instruments .",
    "bvr photometric observations of hd  106506 were taken through the standard cousins b , v and r filters using an sbig stl-630e with a kodak kap-6303e ccd chip that has an array size of 3060 x 2040 , 9 @xmath13 m square pixels giving a plate scale of approximately 0.54 arc seconds per pixel @xcite . table [ photometry_log ] shows the journal of observations while a more detailed analysis of this photometric study of hd  106506 has been included in appendix a.            where b , v and r are listed magnitudes of the standard stars in @xcite .",
    "the instrumental magnitudes , as measured by daophot were @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the zeropoints are @xmath19 and @xmath20 ; while @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the extinction coefficients and @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the colour correction coefficients .",
    "the values determined for the coefficients are given in table [ coefficients ] and the results are shown in table [ bvri_phot ] .",
    "table [ photometry_log ] shows a log of data taken during the observation run in 2007 .",
    "the aperture size selected had a pixel radius of 15 , giving an aperture radius of approximately 8 arc seconds . on the 11th of april ,",
    "several observations were taken of the standard stars in graham s e5-regions @xcite so as to place hd 106506 on the standard magnitude scale .",
    "the stars used were a , o , u , s .",
    "the routines found in the photcal package in iraf were used to determine both the transformation coefficients and the magnitude of the stars , including hd 106506 .",
    "there were three images taken through each filter of each star field and these were averaged , using imcombine , to produce an image with improved signal - to - noise from which the magnitude of all the standard stars and the program stars were measured .",
    "the rotational period was determined using discrete fourier transforms ( dft ) , using the algorithm as explained by @xcite .",
    "the five brighter stars were selected as possible comparison stars and the period was determined for each in b , v and r band .",
    "the average period was determined to be 1.416 @xmath1 0.133 days , and was consistent with all the comparison stars in b , v and r bands .",
    "the error was determined by finding the full width half maximum of the dft line profile .",
    "figure [ period_dft ] shows the phased folded light curve for the v- band as well as the bv and vr colour indices .",
    "the power spectrum is also shown as generated by the dft algorithm .",
    "graham s e5 region , coupled with the 5 stars previously standardised , were used to place hd  106506 onto the cousins magnitude system ."
