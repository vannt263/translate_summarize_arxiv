    "@xmath275 stands for the conformal factor between the euclidean metric on @xmath260 and the standard metric @xmath263 on @xmath122 .",
    "since the laplacian is conformally invariant in dimension two , then passing to the limit in equation  , we obtain @xmath276 thus , we see that @xmath270 is an eigenvalue for the schrodinger operator @xmath277 on the sphere , and the @xmath278 s are its eigenfunctions .",
    "[ mult ] the eigenfunctions @xmath278 , @xmath61 , span a vector space whose dimension is at most @xmath118 .    by lemma  [ mult ]",
    ", we see that the harmonic map @xmath264 , defined by eigenfunctions @xmath279 , lies in the section of the unit sphere by a subspace whose dimension is not greater than @xmath118 . in other words",
    "the harmonic map @xmath264 is actually a harmonic map into the @xmath30-dimensional unit sphere .",
    "hence , its energy is an integer multiple of @xmath29 and , since @xmath280 , we conclude that @xmath270 has to be at least @xmath29 . on the other hand , we have @xmath281 and , by lemma  [ upper_b ] , the latter is not greater than @xmath29 .",
    "thus , we obtain that @xmath183 equals @xmath29 , finishing the proof of theorem  a. the rest of this section is devoted to the proof of lemma  [ mult ] .      to prove the lemma we analyse the structure of the nodal set of the eigenfunctions @xmath278 . following the arguments of cheng  @xcite",
    ", this allows to bound the vanishing order of the @xmath278 s at each nodal point , and hence to estimate the dimension of @xmath282 .",
    "first , since the @xmath232 s are first eigenfunctions of the schrodinger operator @xmath164 , then each of them changes sign .",
    "moreover , by the results in  @xcite the nodal set @xmath283 is an immersed circle in @xmath3 , and the complement @xmath284 has exactly two connected components , called _",
    "nodal domains_. we claim that the bubble point @xmath192 belongs to the closure of the set @xmath285 indeed , for otherwise there exists a neighbourhood of @xmath192 which belongs to the nodal domain of @xmath232 for all sufficiently large @xmath169 .",
    "this , in turn , implies that the limit map @xmath278 does not change sign on the bubble sphere , and hence @xmath270 has to be a zero eigenvalue for the corresponding schrodinger operator .",
    "the latter clearly contradicts to the fact that @xmath270 is positive .    a similar analysis yields that each limit eigenfunction @xmath278 on the bubble sphere has exactly two nodal domains ; their nodal lines are limits of renormalised arcs on the nodal lines of the @xmath232 s .",
    "now the structure theorem in  @xcite implies that any point on the nodal line @xmath286 has vanishing order at most one . in more detail , the nodal set near a critical point with vanishing order @xmath287 is diffeomorphic to the nodal set of a spherical harmonic of order @xmath287 in @xmath257 , which consists of @xmath287 straight lines passing through the origin , see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "3.3 ) . therefore ,",
    "if @xmath287 is greater than one , then by  ( * ? ? ?",
    "3.1 ) the set @xmath288 has at least @xmath118 connected components  a contradiction .",
    "the same analysis equally applies to a non - trivial linear combination of the @xmath278 s , and we conclude that any point on its nodal line also has a vanishing order at most one . now following  ( * ? ? ?",
    "3.4 ) , we show that the dimension of @xmath289 , @xmath61 , is not greater than @xmath118 .",
    "suppose the contrary .",
    "then for any @xmath290 the map @xmath291 has a non - trivial kernel",
    " there exists a non - trivial linear combination of the @xmath278 s that vanishes at @xmath292 together with its first derivatives .",
    "thus , the vanishing order at @xmath292 is greater than one  a contradiction .",
    "_ 1 .  _ the proof of theorem  b is based on the version of the bubbling convergence theorem for harmonic maps with a variable metric on the domain surface , see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "all our arguments in sect .  [ alternative ] and  [ bubble ] admit obvious adjustments to cover this case also .",
    "_ one can analyse the concentration of extremal potentials from the point of view of the bubble tree convergence of harmonic maps , as described in  @xcite .",
    "( the latter is based on a different renormalisation at the bubble point than the one used in sect .  [ bubble ] ) .",
    "more precisely , one can show that when @xmath293 the corresponding harmonic maps @xmath144 , given by eigenfunctions , converge to a constant harmonic map with only one bubble attached at the point @xmath192 ; in other words , no `` secondary '' bubbles appear .",
    "finally , mention that the equality @xmath294 , obtained in sect .",
    "[ bubble ] , reflects the `` no energy loss at the neck '' phenomenon .",
    "_ it is extremely interesting to understand under what hypotheses analogous concentration compactness properties hold for more general ( for example , maximising ) sequences of potentials .",
