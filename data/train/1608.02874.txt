    "in this paper we eliminate a restrictive assumption , which was imposed in the work @xcite of the second author .",
    "more precisely , the existence of a minimizer of a weighted tikhonov functional is proved here rather than assumed as in @xcite .",
    "although similar assumptions of works of the second author @xcite concerning coefficient inverse problems ( cips ) can also be eliminated the same way , we are not doing this here for brevity .",
    "in addition to the theory , we present results of some numerical experiments in which we solve an ill - posed problem for a 1-d quasilinear parabolic equation with the lateral cauchy data .  in this problem , which is also called _ side cauchy problem _",
    ", both dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions are given on one edge of the interval @xmath0 , the initial condition is unknown and it is required to find the solution of that equation inside of that interval .",
    "side cauchy problems for quasilinear parabolic equations have applications in processes involving high temperatures @xcite . in such a process one can measure both the temperature and the heat flux on one side of the boundary .",
    "however , it is impossible to measure these quantities on the rest of the boundary .",
    "still , one is required to compute the temperature in at least a part of the domain of interest .",
    "the underlying pde , which governs the process of the propagation of this temperature , is a parabolic pde .",
    "this equation is quasilinear rather then linear because of high temperatures .",
    "the second application is in the glaciology @xcite . in this case one",
    "is interested in the velocity of a glacier on its bottom side , which is deeply under the surface of the water .",
    "this is the so - called basal velocity .",
    "however , it is impossible to measure that velocity deeply under the surface of the water . on the other hand ,",
    "it is possible to measure that velocity and its normal derivative on the part of the water surface .",
    "so , the idea is to use these measurements to figure out basal velocity .",
    "thus , we come up with the cauchy problem for a quasilinear elliptic equation koz .",
    "it is well known that the phenomena of multiple local minima and ravines plagues least squares tikhonov functionals for nonlinear ill - posed problems , see , e.g. numerical examples in @xcite .",
    "therefore , the convergence of an optimization method for such a functional can be guaranteed only if its starting point is located in a sufficiently small neighborhood of the exact solution , i.e. this is",
    "_ local convergence_. on the other hand , we call a numerical method for an ill - posed problem _ globally convergent _ if there is a theorem , which guarantees that this method delivers at least one point in a sufficiently small neighborhood of the exact solution without any advanced knowledge of this neighborhood @xcite .    in a series of publications of the second author , including some with coauthors , starting in 1997 @xcite and with the recently renewed interest in @xcite special tikhonov - like cost functionals",
    "@xmath1 were constructed for cips .",
    "in particular , some numerical examples are presented in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "this idea was extended to ill - posed cauchy problems for quasilinear pdes of the second order .",
    "numerical studies of the idea of @xcite can be found in @xcite .",
    "the key element of each of these functionals is the presence of the carleman weight function ( cwf ) , i.e. the function which is involved in the carleman estimate for the principal part of the corresponding partial differential operator . the main theorem of each of these works claims that , given a reasonable bounded set @xmath2 of an arbitrary diameter in a reasonable space @xmath3 one can choose the parameter @xmath4 of the cwf , depending on @xmath2 , such that for all @xmath5 the functional @xmath1 is strictly convex on the set @xmath2 .",
    "the strict convexity implies the absence of multiple local minima and ravines .",
    "next , the existence of the minimizer of @xmath1 on @xmath2 was assumed . using this assumption ,",
    "it was proven that the gradient method of the minimization of @xmath1 converges to that minimizer starting from an arbitrary point of @xmath2 , provided that all points obtained via iterations of the gradient method belong to @xmath6 furthermore , it was established that the distance between that minimizer and the exact solution of the corresponding inverse problem is small as long as the noise in the data is small .  in other words ,",
    "convergence of regularized solutions was established .",
    "thus , the above means the _ global convergence _ of the gradient method to the exact solution .",
    "still , the assumptions about the existence of the minimizer on the set @xmath2 and that all points of the sequence of the gradient method belong to @xmath2 are restrictive ones .    in this paper we remove these assumptions via bringing in some ideas of the convex analysis . to simplify the presentation",
    ", we focus here on ill - posed cauchy problems for quasilinear pdes of the second order , i.e. we generalize results of @xcite .",
    "we point out , however , that very similar generalizations can be done for coefficient inverse problems , which were considered in the above cited works @xcite .",
    "those results of the convex analysis require us to change the previous scheme of the method .",
    "more precisely , while the previous scheme of kl1,kkly works with non - zero cauchy data , we now need to have zero cauchy data .",
    "we obtain them via subtracting \" the non - zero cauchy data from the sought for solution .",
    "in addition , we now need to prove the lipschitz continuity of the frecht derivative of our cost functional , which was not done in those previous works . these factors , in turn mean that proofs of main theorems here are different from their analogs in kl1,kkly .",
    "so , we prove the corresponding theorems below .    the idea of applications of carleman estimates to cips was first published in 1981 in the work @xcite .",
    "the method of @xcite was originally designed for proofs of uniqueness theorems for cips with single measurement data , see , e.g. some follow up publications in @xcite .",
    "there is now a large number of publications of different authors discussing the idea of @xcite .",
    "since this is not a survey of that method , we cite here only a few of them @xcite .",
    "surveys of works on the method of @xcite can be found in @xcite , also , see sections 1.10 and 1.11 of the book @xcite .    in section 2",
    "we present required facts from the convex analysis . in section 3",
    "we present the general scheme of our numerical method for ill - posed cauchy problems for quasilinear pdes of the second order .",
    "we also formulate theorems in section 3 . in sections 4 - 7",

    "we specify pdes of the second order for which our technique is applicable . in section 9",
    "we present numerical results .",
    "summary is presented in section 10 .",
    "results of this section are known and can be found in chapters 4 and 5 of the book of vasiliev @xcite .",
