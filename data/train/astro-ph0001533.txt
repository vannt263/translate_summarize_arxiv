    "1998 ; kochanek & narayan 1992 ; nair , narasimha & rao 1993 ) .    assuming that the lens galaxies in these gl systems can be described by an isothermal mass distribution",
    ", one finds that the values of h@xmath4 derived from these gl systems  except for pg1115 + 080 ",
    "are consistent within their 1-@xmath14 errors _ and _ agree with the local , sne ia and s - z determinations of h@xmath4 ( e.g. koopmans & fassnacht 1999 ) .",
    "however , one has to keep in mind that a similar mass - sheet or change in the radial mass profile of the lens galaxies introduce a similar change in the determination of h@xmath4 from each of these gl systems ( e.g. falco , gorenstein & shapiro 1985 ; gorenstein , shapiro & falco 1988 ; grogin & narayan 1992 ; keeton & kochanek 1997 ; wucknitz & refsdal 1999 ) .",
    "hence , also for mass models other than isothermal one might expect the values of h@xmath4 to agree to first order .",
    "strong deviations of the lens - galaxy mass distribution from isothermal , however , would lead to systematic differences between the values of h@xmath4 determined from lensing and those determined from other methods .    in this paper",
    ", we present a determination of the time delay between the two lens images of the class gravitational lens b1600 + 434 , using the light curves obtained during an eight - month vla 8.5-ghz monitoring campaign . in section 2",

    "( 1996 ) and the prh - method ( press et al .",
    "1992 ) to determine a time delay between the lens images and use that to estimate a tentative value for h@xmath4 , keeping the above - mentioned problems with the mass - model degeneracies in mind . in section 4 ,",
    "our conclusions are summarized .",
    "we observed the class gravitational lens b1600 + 434 ( jackson et al . 1995 ; jaunsen & hjorth 1997 ; koopmans , de bruyn & jackson 1998 ) with the vla in a- and b - arrays at 8.5 ghz ( x - band ) , during the period 1998 february 13 to october 14 .",
    "the typical angular resolution of the radio images ranges from about 0.2 arcsec in a - array to 0.7 arcsec in b - array , sufficient to resolve the 1.4-arcsec double . in total",
    "we obtained 75 epochs of about 30 min each , including phase- and flux - calibrator observations and slewing time .",
    "the average time interval between epochs was 3.3 days .",
    "a typical observing run consisted of the sequence listed in table  1 .",
    "this sequence was repeated , typically twice , until about 30 min observing time was filled .",
    "several epochs consisted of only 10 or 20 min , making it necessary to reduce the number of sequences , or the time spent on each of the sources . at the end of a sequence , we again observed 2 min on the phase calibrator j1549 + 506 ( fig.1 ; patnaik et al .",
    "1992 ) .",
    "the flux calibrator , b1634 + 627 ( 3c343 ) , is a slightly extended steep - spectrum source ( fig.1 ; e.g. van breugel et al .",
    "1992 ) , which should not be variable .",
    "its flux density at 8.5 ghz is 0.84@xmath150.01jy , which we obtained with the _ westerbork - synthesis - radio - telescope _ ( wsrt ) in december 1998 .",
    "this value agrees with the average flux density of 0.83jy , obtained with the 26-m university of michigan radio astronomy observatory ( umrao ) telescope , which has been monitoring this source for the past 15 years .",
    "we use the wsrt flux - density determination to bring all flux densities to the correct absolute scale ( sect.2.4 ) .",
    ".basic observing sequence on b1600 + 434 and the phase and flux calibrators .",
    "this sequence was repeated typically twice per session . [ cols= \" < ,",
    "< , < , < \" , ]     for @xmath16=1 , multiple strong peaks are found ( fig.5 ) .",
    "for @xmath16@xmath171 , only one peak is found .",
    "the small decorrelation time scale for @xmath18 makes the dispersion measure especially sensitive to the modulations in both light curves .",
    "these peaks , however , are much stronger in the light curve of image a and the result of external causes ( sect.2.6 ; koopmans & de bruyn , 1999 ) .",
    "hence , a somewhat larger decorrelation time scale will give a better estimate of the time delay , because it is less sensitive to these modulations ( i.e. it averages over these modulations ) .",
    "for very large decorrelation time scales , however , one becomes sensitive to the fact that both light curves show a long - term gradient .",
    "the gradient introduces a systematic difference in the flux - density level between points on the two different light curves , if they are separated by a large time interval .",
    "this artificially increases the dispersion with increasing @xmath16 , as can be seen in fig.5 .",
    "this effect also seems to increase the width of the 95% statistical confidence interval .",
    "the intermediate decorrelation time scales ( @xmath16=2 and 4 ) therefore seem to give a better estimate of the time delay , as it avoids most of these problems .    for the median value of the time delay",
    "we take the average of @xmath16=2 and @xmath16=4 , which seem to give the most stable solution ( see also sect.3.1.3 and fig.6 ) . for the 68% and 95% statistical confidence regions ,",
    "we conservatively take their combined maximum ranges . hence ,",
    "@xmath19    which we take as our best estimate of the time delay between the images in the gravitational lens system b1600 + 434 and the statistical confidence intervals .",
    "several systematic uncertainties remain , which we will investigate below :    1 .",
    "the first has to do with the six outliers on the light - curves ( sect.2.7 ) .",
    "although we gave them significantly larger errorbars , they can still affect the determination of the time delay .",
    "2 .   the choice of the decorrelation time scale seems to influence the median time delay ( sect.3.1.2 ) .",
    "larger decorrelation time scales give larger median time delays .",
    "the flux density ratio that we used in our analysis ( sect.3.1 ) is preliminary and the error was assumed to be gaussian , which might not be the case .    to address the first two points , we ran monte - carlo simulations ( 500 redistributions ) , for decorrelation time scales of @xmath20=3,5, ... ,25 d , using _ all _ epochs shown in fig.4 .",
    "we repeated this without the six outliers ( sect.2.7 ) .",
    "the results are shown in fig.6 .",
    "the values for the median time delays range between 43 to 51 d , for the assumed range of decorrelation time - scales .",
    "the width of the 95% statistical confidence interval seems to minimize in the range @xmath20@xmath211015 d , as was already noted in the previous section .    to estimate the effect of a wrongly chosen intrinsic flux - density ratio , we also ran models for @xmath22=1.202 and 1.222 , which are the assumed intrinsic flux - density ratio plus - minus twice its estimated error .",
    "the first value decreases the median time delay systematically by about 8 days , whereas the latter value increases it by about 7 days .",
    "we thus take the range of about @xmath38 to + 7 days as a good indication of the maximum systematic error range .",
    "we also applied the prh method ( press , rybicki & hewitt 1992 ) , to address the question if the time delay obtained in sect.3.1.2 might critically depend on the method that was used .",
    "we use the implementation of this method in the eso - midas ( version 96nov ) data - reduction package .",
    "we tried several different analytical functions to describe the structure functions of the observed light curves and find no strong dependence of the final result ( i.e. differences of @xmath231 day in the time delay ) on the precise functional form of the structure function .",
    "we exclude the six outliers ( sect.2.7 ) from the analysis and find a delay of @xmath24=@xmath25 d ( 2-@xmath14 ) , where the formal error is derived by varying the time - delay until @xmath26 has increased by 4.0 .",
    "this error is smaller than that derived in sect.3.1.2 , because it does not include all the uncertainties that we took into account in the monte - carlo simulations .",
    "however , we see that both the minimum - dispersion method and the prh method give consistent results within their respective 1-@xmath14 error regions . thence , we conclude that the resulting value of @xmath27 does not strongly depend on the method that is used , at least in the case of b1600 + 434 .",
    "we furthermore find a minimum-@xmath28 value of @xmath21134 at @xmath24=48 d for 137 degrees of freedom , which is statistically highly plausible .",
    "this lends strong credibility to our error analysis ( sect.2.7 ) , suggesting that the error on the individual flux - density points are indeed 0.70.8% for most epochs .",
    "to estimate a tentative value for the hubble parameter ( h@xmath4 ) , we use the mass models for b1600 + 434 from koopmans et al . ( 1998 ) . in doing this",
    ", one should keep in mind the difficulties and degeneracies that were mentioned in sect.1 .",
    "the values derived here should therefore be regarded as indicative , as long as no better constraints on the radial mass profile of the lens galaxy are obtained .",
    "spectroscopic observations of the lens system on 1998 april 20 with the w.m .",
    "keck - ii telescope , have recently confirmed the assumption that the nearby companion galaxy ( g2 ) has the same redshift ( @xmath13=0.41 ; fassnacht et al . , in preparation ) as the lensing galaxy ( g1 ) . for a lens galaxy with an oblate isothermal dark - matter halo , the relation between the time delay and hubble parameter",
    "was then found to be @xmath29 $ ] km  s@xmath7  mpc@xmath7 , for @xmath8=1 and @xmath9=0 .",
    "the errors indicate the maximum range of the isothermal - model time delays from koopmans et al .",
    "recently , the time - delay dependence of h@xmath4 found for this isothermal mass model was corroborated by maller et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , who did a similar analysis of b1600 + 434 , using a deep nicmos - f160w _ hst _ exposure . combining this relation with the median time delay ( sect.3.1.2 ) ,",
    "the hubble parameter then becomes @xmath30 km  s@xmath7  mpc@xmath7 ( 95% ) , for @xmath8=1 and @xmath9=0 .",
    "a maximum systematic error between @xmath315 to + 26 km s@xmath7 mpc@xmath7 is estimated from the combination of model and systematic time - delay errors .",
    "this error does not include the uncertainty in the slope of the radial mass profile .",
    "in fact , for a modified hubble profile ( mhp ) halo mass model we find a significantly higher value for the hubble parameter , h@xmath4=74@xmath31 km s@xmath7 mpc@xmath7 ( 95% ) , with a maximum systematic error between @xmath322 to + 22 km s@xmath7 mpc@xmath7 .",
    "for a flat universe with @xmath32=0.3 and @xmath9=0.7 , these values of h@xmath4 increase by 5.4% . at this points b1600 + 434 is not a gl system from which h@xmath4 can be constrained reliably .",
    "in wucknitz & refsdal ( 1999 ) it was shown that in general the time delay is a strong function of the slope of the radial mass profile of the mass distribution of the lens galaxy . because the lens - image properties can be recovered to first order for a range of different slopes ,",
    "the expected time delay from a gl system as function of h@xmath4 is also a strong function of this slope .",
    "this degeneracy between the time delay and the slope makes an accurate determination of h@xmath4 from gl systems difficult , especially in two - image lens systems like b1600 + 434 .",
    "hence , if h@xmath4 can be determined with greater accuracy ( @xmath2310% error ) , the measured time delay can be used to constrain the slope of the radial mass profile of the dark - matter halo .",
    "we have monitored the class gravitational lens b1600 + 434 at 8.5 ghz with the vla in a and b - arrays , during the period from february to october 1998 .",
    "the light curves show a nearly linear decrease of 18 - 19% in the flux density of both lens images over this period .",
    "however , image a also shows rapid variability ( up to 11% peak - to - peak ) on scales of days to weeks , whereas image b shows significantly less short - term variability ( upto 6% peak - to - peak ) .",
    "the short - term variability occurs over an observing period that is much longer than any conceivable time delay .",
    "in koopmans & de bruyn ( 1999 ) it is shown that the short - term variability is predominantly of external origin .",
    "two plausible explanations of this external variability are suggested : scintillation caused by the ionized component of the galactic ism or radio microlensing of a core - jet structure by massive compact objects in the lens galaxy .",
    "both possibilities are examined in more detail in koopmans & de bruyn ( 1999 ) . a comparison of the result from the vla 8.5-ghz , presented in this paper , and multi - frequency ( 1.4 and 5-ghz ) wsrt monitoring data with the expected dependence of scintillation on frequency ( e.g. narayan 1992 ; taylor & cordes 1993 ; rickett et al .",
    "1995 ) , shows that the scintillation hypothesis underestimates the short - term rms variability at 1.4 ghz by a factor @xmath218 . within the uncertainties ,",
    "the microlensing hypothesis predicts the correct frequency - dependence of the short - term rms variability as function of frequency .",
    "the radio - microlensing hypothesis therefore seems most viable at present .    from the vla 8.5-ghz light curves",
    ", we determined a median time delay of @xmath33=47@xmath34 days ( 95% statistical confidence ) between the lens images . a maximum systematic error between @xmath38 and + 7 d is estimated .",
    "we used the minimum - dispersion method from pelt et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , but find the same time - delay from the prh - method from press et al .",
    "( 1992 ) .    combining this with the isothermal lens mass models from koopmans et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , the hubble parameter would become h@xmath4=57@xmath35 km s@xmath7mpc@xmath7 ( 95% ) for @xmath8=1 and @xmath9=0 .",
    "a maximum systematic error between @xmath315 and + 26 km s@xmath7 mpc@xmath7 is estimated .",
    "similarily , the mhp mass models would give h@xmath4=74@xmath31 km s@xmath7 mpc@xmath7 ( 95% ) , with a maximum systematic error between @xmath322 and + 22 km s@xmath7 mpc@xmath7 , for the same cosmological model .",
    "we hope to improve on the determination of this time delay with an ongoing three - frequency vla monitoring campaign ( june 1999 to feb .",
    "because of the degeneracy between the slope of the radial mass profile and the expected time delay between the lens images as function of h@xmath4 , the above - given values of h@xmath4 should be regarded as indicative .    if h@xmath4 can be determined accurately from independent methods and no extra constraints on the lens model can be found , it is more interesting to use that observed time delay to constrain the slope of radial mass profile of the dark - matter halo around the lensing edge - on spiral galaxy in b1600 + 434 .",
