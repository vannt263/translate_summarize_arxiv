    "electric currents can be used to manipulate the magnetization in ferromagnets .",
    "this phenomenon arises from the intricate coupling between the quasi - particle flow and the collective magnetic degrees of freedom , and it has enabled the development of spin - torque oscillators , spin - logic devices , and spin - transfer torque ( stt)-ram ;  @xcite the latter entered the marketplace at the end of 2012 . in its simplest manifestation , current - driven excitations of the ferromagnets are caused by the stt mechanism , in which spin angular momentum is transferred from the spin - polarized conduction electrons to the magnetization .",
    "recent theory  @xcite and experiments  @xcite have shown that currents can also cause magnetization torques via relativistic , intrinsic spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) , often referred to as spin - orbit torques ( sots ) .",
    "relativistic sots provide alternative and efficient routes for the manipulation of the magnetization that , in contrast to non - relativistic stts , require neither spin - polarizers nor textured ferromagnets .",
    "sots exist in systems with structural asymmetry , which induces a strong intrinsic soc .",
    "theory predicts that soc in combination with an applied electric field produces an out - of - equilibrium spin density that in turn yields a torque on the magnetization .",
    "@xcite the effect of an sot was first detected in strained ( ga , mn)as .  @xcite the observed switching of samples with uniform magnetization markedly differs from the typical behavior in metallic ferromagnets , wherein a heterogeneous magnetic texture is required to induce an stt .",
    "@xcite a similar switching of a single - domain ferromagnet has also been observed in an ultrathin co layer sandwiched between pt and @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite both sots  @xcite and the spin - hall effect ( she ) in combination with conventional stts  @xcite have been proposed to be responsible for the switching co magnetization . in the latter case , the she in the pt layer produces a spin - current that diffuses into the co layer , causing an stt on the magnetization .",
    "@xcite interestingly , in this system , experiments have observed fast current - driven motion of ferromagnetic domain walls ( dws ) .",
    "@xcite an soc - induced antisymmetric exchange interaction , known as the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction ( dmi ) ,  @xcite stabilizes chiral dws  @xcite with a high dw mobility whose spin texture is very robust with respect to high current densities .  @xcite highly efficient",
    ", current - driven dw motion has also been observed in trilayers of co and ni interfaced with pt .",
    "@xcite in both @xmath0 and @xmath2 systems , the dws move at high speeds and occasionally in a direction opposite of that expected for the non - relativistic bulk stt .",
    "the aforementioned experiments demonstrate that ultrathin metallic ferromagnets in asymmetric heterostructures are important in the design of future spintronic devices wherein the magnetization is efficiently controlled by electric currents .",
    "the interplay between soc effects , such as the dmi , sots , and she , is believed to be responsible for the remarkable behavior of these systems . however , a detailed understanding of their properties requires improved theoretical models that exceed the present phenomenological framework used to model current - induced magnetization dynamics .    in this letter",
    ", we formulate a general phenomenology of current - induced torques in systems with arbitrarily strong spin - orbit interaction .",
    "we apply the formalism to compute the current - driven dw drift velocity in @xmath0 trilayers and to identify a novel sot .",
    "the effect of the new torque can be manipulated via the dmi and can , together with the she , induce dw motion even when the electric currents are applied parallel to the dws .",
    "this opens a completely new path for controlling the dissipative current - induced torque by engineering the interfaces in ferromagnetic heterostructures .",
    "the magnetization dynamics of metallic ferromagnets is well - described by the landau - lifshitz - gilbert - slonczewski ( llgs ) equation :  @xcite @xmath3 here , @xmath4 is ( minus ) the gyromagnetic ratio , @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) is the unit direction vector of the magnetization @xmath7 , and @xmath8/\\delta \\mathbf{m}$ ] is the effective field determined by the magnetic free - energy functional @xmath9 $ ] .",
    "the friction processes in the magnetic system are modeled by the gilbert damping that is parameterized by the symmetrical , second - rank tensor @xmath10 .",
    "the last term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "is  @xcite @xmath11 and describes the current - induced torques .",
    "the torques of eq .   contain reactive and dissipative contributions .",
    "the term proportional to the parameter @xmath12 represents the dissipative torque because it breaks the time - reversal symmetry of eq .  .",
    "the vector @xmath13 is directed along the out - of - equilibrium current density @xmath14 and is proportional to the current density , the equilibrium spin density , and the spin polarization of the induced current .",
    "is fully rotationally symmetric in both the spin space and the coordinate space .",
    "this can be seen by applying a global rotation operator @xmath15 to the magnetization and the spatial vectors : @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .",
    "separate rotations of the spin space and the coordinate space leave the magnitude of the torque invariant : @xmath19 thus , the stt given by eq .   is completely decoupled from the symmetry of the underlying crystal lattice .",
    "however , in systems with strong intrinsic soc , eq .",
    "is not sufficient to describe the magnetization dynamics .",
    "the only possible effect of the intrinsic soc included in eq .",
    "is the renormalization of the @xmath12 parameter .",
    "the intrinsic soc mediates a coupling between the spin space and the crystal lattice . as a consequence ,",
    "the system is only invariant under proper and improper rotations that leave the crystal structure unchanged and that act simultaneously on the spin space and on the coordinate space .",
    "the intrinsic soc therefore introduces several new torques that are dependent on the orientation of the magnetization with respect to the crystal lattice .",
    "examples of such sots have been derived theoretically in refs .",
    "however , to date , a general theoretical framework has not been developed that systematically and correctly extends the llg phenomenology in eq .   to include the intrinsic soc effects .",

    "degrees about the @xmath31 axis . due to the four - fold symmetry of the underlying crystal lattice ,",
    "the two cases are equivalent .",
    "neumann s principle implies that the local torques on the two textures are related by a four - fold rotation .",
    "this is illustrated in ( c ) and ( d ) , which show the torque , the gradient , and the direction of the magnetization at two equivalent points indicated by the black arrows . ]",
    "we will deduce the second - rank tensor @xmath32 from neumann s principle , which states that `` _ _ any type of symmetry which is exhibited by the point group of the crystal is possessed by every physical property of the crystal _ _ '' .",
    "@xcite an illustration of how this principle imposes symmetry relations on the torque in eq .",
    "is presented fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . as an example , let us assume that the material has a four - fold symmetry axis along @xmath31",
    "[ fig1]a - b show two systems containing a dw along the @xmath33 and @xmath34 axis , respectively , with a current density applied perpendicular to the dw .",
    "the two systems in figs .",
    "[ fig1]a - b are related by a rotation @xmath35 of @xmath36 degrees about the @xmath31 axis , which leads to the following transformations : @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 . because the magnetization is a pseudovector , its transformation rule includes the determinant @xmath41 . due to the four - fold symmetry of the system , the two cases in figs .",
    "[ fig1]a - b are equivalent , and neumann s principle implies that the torques induced on the two magnetic textures are related by @xmath35 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath42 ( figs .",

    "\\label{eq : sot_2}\\ ] ] this is the first central result of our work . we have removed the subscript of @xmath45 denoting the symmetry operation because eq .   holds for any symmetry operation that is an element of the crystal s point group .",
    ".   determines many symmetry aspects of the torque , the dependence of torque on the magnetization direction and the gradients of the magnetization means that a large number of functions can satisfy eq .  .",
    "this situation closely resembles the case of the large number of terms that can describe the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy of a system .",
    "although the anisotropy energy should obey the symmetries of the material , it is common to approximate the dependence by the first harmonics of this dependence .",
    "thus , to simplify the tensor form of @xmath32 , we assume that its components can be expressed as a series expansion in increasing powers of @xmath46 and @xmath47 @xmath48 in eq .  , and",
    "in the following discussion , summation over repeated indices is implied .",
    "the power expansion in eq .   represents a systematic scheme for deriving current - induced torques of increasing degrees of anisotropy .",
    "the number of terms in the expansion required to obtain a sufficiently accurate description of the magnetization dynamics can be determined from experimental data . as a demonstration , we limit our discussion to the terms explicitly written in eq .   because they lead to a simple extension of eq .  , and similar to the case of magnetic anisotropy",

    ", @xmath49 and @xmath50 describe the reactive and dissipative sots , respectively , that are present even in systems with uniform magnetization .",
    "the tensors @xmath51 and @xmath52 are generalizations of the reactive and dissipative torques given in eq .  .",
    "our theory therefore demonstates that in systems with strong intrinsic soc , the reactive torque is generalized to become a tensor of rank five , while the dissipative torque parameter @xmath12 becomes a tensor of rank four . from our derived symmetry relations in eq .   and the expansion of @xmath53 in eq .  , we find that the tensors @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath52 , and @xmath51 must satisfy the symmetry relations @xmath54 eqs .   - represent our second central result , and they reduce the number of independent tensor coefficients and greatly simplify the forms of the tensors .",

    "the torques originating from the low - order tensors given by eqs .",
    "- lead to a generalization of eq .  .",
    "the torques in eq .   are obtained from our formalism by assuming a full rotational symmetry under separate rotations of the spin space and the coordinate space . under these symmetry requirements ,",

    "when @xmath59 .",
    "here , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the kronecker delta and the levi - civita tensor , respectively .",
    "next , we consider the ferromagnetic heterostructure @xmath0 and apply the phenomenology to the study of current - induced dw motion .",

    "@xcite we assume a fully epitaxial system .",
    "the single co layer has a trigonal crystal structure that is described by the centrosymmetric point group @xmath63 , in which the three - fold axis of rotation is along the @xmath62 $ ] direction .",

    "the soc in the co layer is , therefore , assumed to be invariant under the action of @xmath64 when the symmetry operations act simultaneously on the spin and coordinate spaces .",

    "we believe that the dw dynamics are dominated by the lowest - order terms given by eqs .   - in combination with the she torque ; higher - order terms can be included to refine the results .",

    "the remaining part of @xmath89 is governed by the soc and is therefore assumed to provide a negligible correction .",
    "a similar simplification can not be applied to the @xmath90 tensor because even the isotropic part @xmath91 is proportional to the spin - flip rate , which is primarily controlled by the soc .",

    ".   arises from the she torque and the dissipative homogeneous sot . the term proportional to @xmath109 represents a conventional dissipative stt term in which the current - driven dw motion depends only on the relative angle between the applied current and the dw direction .    the expression for @xmath110 of eq .",
    "also contains a new dissipative current - induced torque that has not been previously reported .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath111 describes a dissipative torque that is dependent on the dw structure through the angle @xmath112 .",

    "another interesting phenomenon observed from eq .",
    "is the current - driven dw motion induced by an electric current applied perpendicular to the texture direction , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath117 . depending on the value of @xmath112 , both the @xmath118 term and the @xmath111 term can induce a dw motion in this case .",

    "i.e. _ , a bloch wall structure , whereas the @xmath111 term attains its maximum efficiency for the angles @xmath121 . for @xmath122 , eq .   implies that a bloch wall motion is only induced by the two @xmath12 terms , whereas both the @xmath118 term and the @xmath12 terms contribute to the motion of nel walls , _",
    "i.e. _ , when @xmath123 .",
    "this is in agreement with previously reported results .",
    "@xcite    in polycrystalline or disordered systems , the discrete three - fold rotation symmetry is averaged out , and a full rotational symmetry about the @xmath31 axis can be assumed .",
    "however , this symmetry still allows for all tensor coefficients in eq .   to be present , and",
    "the equation remains unchanged .",
    "in summary , we developed a novel phenomenology of current - induced magnetization dynamics that is valid for any strength of the intrinsic soc .",
    "the formalism is applied to the study of current - induced dw motion in the ferromagnetic heterostructure @xmath0 .",
    "our results show that the current - driven dw motion is dependent on a novel dissipative stt that can be controlled via the dmi ."
