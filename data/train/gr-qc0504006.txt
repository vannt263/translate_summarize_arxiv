    "continuous gravitational waves from , for example , rotating neutron stars with non - axisymmetric deformations such as mountains or oscillation - modes , are one of the primary targets of current - generation detectors of both interferometric- ( e.g. see  @xcite ) as well as bar - detector design  @xcite .    in this paper we restrict ourselves to gravitational waves emitted from isolated neutron stars with negligible proper motion , for which the signal can be assumed to be a nearly monochromatic sinusoidal ( with slowly decreasing frequency ) in the solar - system barycenter frame ( ssb ) .",
    "the corresponding signal received at the detector will be doppler - modulated by the spin of the earth and its orbital motion around the sun .",
    "the phase of the received signal therefore depends not only on its intrinsic frequency @xmath0 and spindowns @xmath1 , but also on the sky - position ( denoted by @xmath2 and @xmath3 for right ascension and declination ) of the source and on the detector location .",
    "in addition there is a time - dependent amplitude modulation of the signal depending on its polarisation angle @xmath4 and amplitudes @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "however , as shown in  @xcite , one can eliminate these `` amplitude parameters '' together with the initial phase of the signal @xmath7 by analytically maximising the detection statistic over these parameters .",
    "the resulting reduced parameter - space therefore only consists of the `` phase parameters '' @xmath8 , and the corresponding partially maximised detection statistic is usually referred to as the `` @xmath9-statistic '' .    given a stretch of data @xmath10 from the detector , an untargeted search ( as opposed to a search for known pulsars ) consists of calculating the detection statistic @xmath9 over the parameter space ( by sampling individual points ) and determining the location of `` candidates '' that cross a predetermined threshold . for a given signal @xmath11 ,",
    "the detection statistic @xmath9 in a search - point @xmath12 generally depends on the parameter - mismatch @xmath13 , i.e. , @xmath14 ( strictly speaking , @xmath9 also depends on the amplitude parameters of the signal ) . neglecting noise",
    ", one can expect @xmath9 to be maximal for the perfectly matched search - point @xmath15 . in the local neighbourhood of this point",
    ", the loss @xmath16 in detection statistic can be quantified in terms of a parameter - space metric as discussed in  @xcite .",
    "namely , neglecting effects of the amplitude - parameters of the signal , this metric can be defined as @xmath17 .    in the case of isolated neutron stars , we find that this metric is _ highly _ anisotropic in terms of the above parameter - space variables ( in particular with respect to sky - position ) , as will also be seen in .",
    "furthermore , the global behaviour of @xmath9 differs dramatically from the local quadratic decrease as a function of parameter - mismatch @xmath18 .",
    "this can be seen , for example , in for an all - sky search at fixed frequency of an injected signal . for each target",
    "search - frequency @xmath0 within the doppler - window of the signal frequency @xmath19 , one finds a very thin circular band on the sky along which @xmath9 is of comparable magnitude to its maximum , while it drops sharply to zero in the directions orthogonal to this `` circle '' . in the local limit",
    "this feature has already been pointed out in  @xcite .    in this work we present an approximate analytic description of these `` circles in the sky '' , tracing their physical origin to the doppler - shift due to the orbital motion around the sun . the doppler - shift induced by the spin - motion of the earth as well as",
    "the amplitude modulations due to the rotating antenna - pattern are found to give only very small corrections to the _ structure _ of these patterns in parameter - space ( i.e. , the location of the circles ) , while they do contribute significantly to the _ amplitude _ of the @xmath9-statistic along these circles .",
    "the gravitational - wave strain @xmath20 at the detector can be written in the form @xmath21 where @xmath22 are the antenna - pattern functions , and @xmath23 are the two polarisation components of the gravitational wave . for a continuous pulsar - signal we can write @xmath24 the phase @xmath25 of the signal is assumed to be of the form @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the number of spindown parameters , and @xmath28 is the arrival time in the solar - system barycenter ( ssb ) of a wave - front from direction @xmath29 arriving at the detector at time @xmath30 , i.e. , @xmath31 with @xmath32 denoting the vector from the ssb to the detector .",
    "as shown in  @xcite , the full phase - model can be simplified by an approximated model without significant loss in detection statistic , namely @xmath33\\,,\\ ] ] which will be dominated by the first term , i.e. , @xmath34 . in the case of stationary gaussian noise , the likelihood ratio @xmath35 ( which is the optimal detection statistic in the sense of neyman - pearson )",

    "in the following we make the simplifying assumption that we can neglect the amplitude - modulation caused by the antenna - pattern , so we assume @xmath40 , and using and this results in the simplified strain model @xmath41 maximising the log - likelihood function over the two unknown amplitudes @xmath42 , we obtain @xmath43     = { t\\over 2 s_h}\\left| \\left(x||e^{-i\\phi } \\right ) \\right|^2   \\equiv { t\\over 2 s_h } |x|^2\\,,\\ ] ] defining the matched - filtering amplitude @xmath44 . in the following",

    "we see from that @xmath52 will have a global maximum of @xmath53 if the phase - parameters of the template are perfectly matched to the signal , i.e. , @xmath54 , while @xmath52 will decrease very rapidly for increasing phase - mismatches .",
    "the central aim of the following investigation is to determine the regions in parameter - space for which the detection statistic @xmath52 is of order unity for a given signal @xmath55 .",
    "in order to simplify the following discussion , we restrict ourselves in this study to pulsar - signals with negligible spindown over the observation period @xmath57 , so we assume @xmath58 for @xmath59 .",

    ", we can write the phase - mismatch due to the spin - motion of the earth as @xmath78 where we defined @xmath79 and @xmath80 and where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the parallel and orthogonal projections of @xmath83 with respect to the rotation axis @xmath76 . using this decomposition , we can apply the jacobi - anger expansion as follows : @xmath84 substituting this together with into the matched - filtering amplitude , we obtain @xmath85 where @xmath86 \\ , d t \\,.\\ ] ]      contrary to the spin - motion , the orbital motion induces a slowly varying and non - oscillatory phase - correction for observation - times @xmath87  year , so we can expand the orbital phase - mismatch @xmath88 in terms of the small quantity @xmath89 , which leads to @xmath90\\,d t\\,,\\ ] ] with the coefficients @xmath91 where we defined @xmath92 , and where @xmath93 denotes the orbital velocity at the start of the observation @xmath94 .",

    "on can see from its definition that @xmath52 has a global maximum of @xmath106 in the perfectly matched case ( @xmath107 and @xmath108 ) , while it will be nearly zero almost everywhere else , because generally @xmath49 will not be small .",
    "guided by the observed structure of the detection statistic ( see , for example ) , we focus on the points in parameter space where @xmath52 ( or @xmath9 ) has a local maximum in target - frequency @xmath0 for a fixed sky - position @xmath109 , i.e. , @xmath110 in order to understand the qualitative features of these local maxima , we now also neglect the spin motion of the earth ( setting @xmath111 and @xmath112 ) , and using and we obtain the following condition for local maxima ( in the sense of ( [ eq:34 ] ) ) : @xmath113 where we write @xmath114",
    ". we can solve this order by order in @xmath57 ( strictly speaking , in the small parameter @xmath115 ) , and to zeroth order we find @xmath116 as @xmath117 . for the next order",
    "we therefore solve with the ansatz @xmath118 ( with @xmath119 ) , so we find @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the first order approximation of the orbital velocity at the midpoint of the observation time .",
    "this scheme can be extended to arbitrary order in @xmath57 , but for the qualitative discussion here we restrict ourselves to first order .",
    "the condition can be expressed more explicitly as @xmath122 for a given signal @xmath123 , this equation describes the ( approximate ) location of the local maxima of @xmath52 as a function of @xmath0 for fixed @xmath109 .",
    "conversely this can be regarded at fixed frequency @xmath0 , describing the sky - locations @xmath109 in which the maximum occurs at this particular frequency @xmath0 . from the above equation",
    "one can easily see that these points @xmath109 describe a circle in the sky , which has its centre in @xmath124 , and an opening angle determined by the signal - location and the target frequency . in the case",
    "@xmath125 , we see that @xmath126 is one of the possible solutions of , and so the circle will pass through the signal - location in the sky . if @xmath127 , then we must have @xmath128 , i.e. , the opening angle of the circle has to be larger than in the case of a perfectly matched target - frequency , and vice - versa for the case of @xmath129 . for a 10-hour integration starting at gps - time @xmath130  s ,",
    "the orbital velocity at the midpoint is , and the corresponding family of circles is shown in .",
    "hours observation starting at gps - time @xmath130  s. the direction of @xmath124 is marked by @xmath131 , while @xmath132 indicates the direction @xmath133 .",
    "[ fig : circles1],scaledwidth=70.0% ]    this equation also determines the upper limit on the frequency - mismatch @xmath134 for which such a local maximum is possible , namely , by rewriting as @xmath135 we see that the maximal relative frequency - mismatch is bounded by _",
    "twice _ the doppler - shift due to the orbital velocity . using the value @xmath136  m  s@xmath137",
    ", this corresponds to a `` doppler - window '' of @xmath138 .",
    "we note another interesting property of the approximate expression for the matched - filtering amplitude @xmath52 : namely , from the above discussion we know that the local maxima of @xmath52 occur on or close to the circles described by , which are characterised by @xmath139 .",
    "therefore we see from that the amplitude of @xmath140 along these circles will be dominated by the factor @xmath141 , where @xmath142 is proportional to @xmath143 , the projection of @xmath83 into the equatorial plane .",
    "this factor is therefore symmetrical in the target sky - position @xmath109 with respect to the equatorial plane , a feature which can indeed be seen in the plot of shown in ( b ) .",
    "interestingly , this symmetry _ can _ still be present in the fully numerical @xmath9-statistic , as seen , for example , in ( b ) , while the effects of spin - motion and antenna - patterns can also mask this feature depending on the parameters , as seen in ( a ) .",
    "we now turn to comparing these analytic results to the actual parameter - space structure of the fully numerical @xmath9-statistic including all effects of amplitude - modulation and using an ephemeris - based description of the detector - motion . as an example",
    ", we consider a 10-hour observation time starting at gps - time @xmath130  s , and we use a fake pulsar - signal at @xmath144  hz and sky - position @xmath145 , for two different choices of amplitude - parameters shown in . in the following the detector - location is always chosen to be the ligo  livingston  observatory ( llo ) , and we only consider pure signals without noise .",

    "the resulting @xmath9-statistic projected on the sky is shown in ( a ) and ( b ) for pulsar - signals i and ii , respectively .    from these projected plots we see more clearly that the variation of the amplitude of the @xmath9-statistic maxima is more sensitive to the polarisation - parameters of the signal , due to effects of the antenna - pattern .",

    "summarising these observations we can state that the _ locations _ of the local maxima of @xmath9 are dominantly determined by the orbital velocity of the earth , and are described very well of the maximum of @xmath9 for a fixed sky - position @xmath109 and the theoretical prediction @xmath165 from yields the bound @xmath166 over the whole sky .",
    "] by the circles , independently of detector - location and amplitude - parameters of the signal .",
    "the spin - motion of the detector and amplitude - modulation due to the rotating antenna - pattern , on the other hand , are responsible for the variation of the amplitude of @xmath9 along these circles , as seen in .",
    "finally , we plot the approximate detection amplitude @xmath167 given by over the sky for different target frequencies , as shown in ( a ) , which shows some striking similarities to the ` exact ' result in .",
    "in particular , it exhibits the feature of vanishing very rapidly outside the narrow `` circles '' described approximately by .",
    "the amplitude of @xmath167 on the circles , however , is not a good description of the corresponding @xmath9-statistic amplitude , as @xmath167 is seen to be much more strongly peaked around the signal - location and decreases rather rapidly to about @xmath168 on most of the circles ( see ( b ) ) , while the @xmath9-statistic has a similar amplitude to the maximum over most of the circles .",
    "note also that ( b ) illustrates the equatorial symmetry of @xmath167 as discussed at the end of .",
    "in a practical search for continuous gravitational waves we will usually be interested in the highest values ( `` candidates '' ) of @xmath9 over a chosen volume of the parameter - space . from the results presented here we expect that a real signal would generate candidates nearly everywhere on the sky within the doppler - window @xmath169 of the signal - frequency @xmath19 .",
    "all these candidates , however , will satisfy with an ( approximately ) identical value on the right - hand side , and so the quantity @xmath170 is an ( approximate ) invariant of candidates caused by the same signal .",
    "this could be a very useful criterion for classifying equivalent candidates , and also for determining coincident candidates from different detectors .",
    "one could further use this to construct coincidence - tests of candidates from different observation times , as @xmath171 is a known function of time . in order for these methods to be practically useful , however , the errors of the different approximations need to be quantified , and we need to test the robustness of the suggested coincidence criteria in the presence of noise ."
