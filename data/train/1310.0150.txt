    "casadevall and fang go on to call for `` enhanced training in probability and statistics , '' among other remedies including `` reembracing philosophy . ''",

    "scientific reproducibility therefore is a responsibility of statisticians . at a minimum",
    ", reproducibility manifests itself in the stability of statistical results relative to `` reasonable '' perturbations to data and to the method or model used .",
    "reproducibility of scientific conclusions is closely related to their reliability .",
    "it is receiving much well - deserved attention lately in the scientific community ( e.g. , ioannidis , @xcite ; kraft et al .",
    ", @xcite , casadevall and fang , @xcite ; nosek et al . , @xcite ) and in the media ( e.g. , naik , @xcite ; booth , @xcite ) . drawing a scientific conclusion involves multiple steps .",
    "first , data are collected by one laboratory or one group , ideally with a clear hypothesis in the mind of the experimenter or scientist . in the age of information technology , however , more and more massive amounts of data are collected for fishing expeditions to `` discover '' scientific facts .",
    "these expeditions involve running computer codes on data for data cleaning and analysis ( modeling and validation ) .",
    "before these facts become `` knowledge , '' they have to be reproduced or replicated through new sets of data by the same group or preferably by other groups .",
    "given a fixed set of data , donoho et al .",
    "( @xcite ) discuss reproducible research in computational hormonic analysis with implications on computer - code or computing - environment reproducibility in computational sciences including statistics .",
    "fonio et al .",
    "( @xcite ) discuss replicability between laboratories as an important screening mechanism for discoveries .",
    "reproducibility could have multitudes of meaning to different people .",
    "one articulation on the meanings of reproducibility , replication , and repeatability can be found in stodden ( @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    ", we advocate for more involvement of statisticians in science and for an enhanced emphasis on stability within the statistical framework .",
    "stability has been of a great concern in statistics .",
    "for example , in the words of hampel et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , ``  robustness theories can be viewed as stability theories of statistical inference '' ( p. 8) . even in low - dimensional linear regression models",
    ", collinearity is known to cause instability of ols or problem for individual parameter estimates so that significance testing for these estimates becomes unreliable . here",
    "we demonstrate the importance of statistics for understanding our brain ; we describe our methodological work on estimation stability that helps interpret models reliably in neuroscience ; and we articulate how our solving neuroscience problems motivates theoretical work on stability and robust statistics in high - dimensional regression models .",
    "in other words , we tell an interwinding story of scientific investigation and statistical developments .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : fmri ] , we cover our `` intellectual adventure '' into neursocience , in collaboration with the gallant lab at uc berkeley , to understand human visual pathway via fmri brain signals invoked by natural stimuli ( images or movies ) ( cf .",
    "kay et al . , @xcite , naselaris et al . ,",
    "@xcite , kay and gallant , @xcite , naselaris et al . , @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , we describe how our statistical encoding and decoding models are the backbones of `` mind - reading computers , '' as one of the 50 best inventions of 2011 by the time magazine ( nishimoto et al . , @xcite ) .",
    "in order to find out `` how things really are , '' we argue that reliable interpretation needs stability .",
    "we define stability relative to a data perturbation scheme . in section  [ sec : stability ] , we briefly review the vast literature on different data perturbation schemes such as jacknife , subsampling , and bootstrap .",
    "( we note that data perturbation in general means not only taking subsets of data units from a given data set , but also sampling from an underlying distribution or replicating the experiment for a new set of data . )    in section  [ sec : es - cv ] , we review an estimation stability ( es ) measure taken from lim and yu ( @xcite ) for regression feature selection . combining es with cv as in lim and yu ( @xcite )",
    "gives rise to a smoothing parameter selector es - cv for lasso ( or other regularization methods ) .",
    "when we apply es - cv to the movie - fmri data , we obtain a 60% reduction of the model size or the number of features selected at a negligible loss of 1.3% in terms of prediction accuracy .",
    "subsequently , the es - cv - lasso models are both sparse and more reliable hence better suited for interpretation due to their stability and simplicity .",
    "the stability considerations in our neuroscience endeavors have prompted us to connect with the concept of stability from the robust statistics point of view . in el karoui",
    "( @xcite ) , we obtain very interesting theoretical results in high - dimensional regression models with @xmath0 predictors and @xmath1 samples , shedding light on how sample variability in the design matrix meets heavier tail error distributions when @xmath3 is approximately a constant in @xmath4 or in the random matrix regime .",
    "we describe these results in an important special case in section [ sec : robust ] .",
    "in particular , we see that when @xmath5 and @xmath6 or so , the ordinary least squares ( ols ) estimator is better than the least absolute deviation ( lad ) estimator when the error distribution is double exponential .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "neuroscience holds the key to understanding how our mind works .",
    "modern neuroscience is invigorated by massive and multi - modal forms of data enabled by advances in technology ( cf .",
    "atkil , martone and van essen , @xcite ) .",
    "building mathematical / statistical models on this data , computational neuroscience is at the frontier of neuroscience .",
    "the gallant lab at uc berkeley is a leading neuroscience lab specializing in understanding the visual pathway , and is a long - term collaborator with the author s research group .",
    "it pioneered the use of natural stimuli in experiments to invoke brain signals , in contrast to synthetic signals such as white noise and moving bars or checker boards as previously done .",
    "simply put , the human visual pathway works as follows .",
    "visual signals are recorded by retina and through the relay center lgn they are transmitted to primary visual cortex areas v1 , on to v2 and v4 , on the `` what '' pathway ( in contrast to the `` where '' pathway ) ( cf . goodale and milner , @xcite ) .",
    "computational vision neuroscience aims at modeling two related tasks carried out by the brain ( cf .",
    "dayan and abbott , @xcite ) through two kinds of models .",
    "the first kind , the encoding model , predicts brain signals from visual stimuli , while the second kind , the decoding model recovers visual stimuli from brain signals .",
    "often , decoding models are built upon encoding models and hence indirectly validate the former , but they are important in their own right . in the september issue of _ current biology _ , our joint paper with the gallant lab , nishimoto et al .",
    "( @xcite ) invents a decoding ( or movie reconstruction ) algorithm to reconstruct movies from fmri brain signals .",
    "this work has received intensive and extensive coverage by the media including the economist s oct .",
    "29th 2011 issue ( `` reading the brain : mind - goggling '' ) and the national public radio in their program `` forum with michael krasny '' on tue , sept .",
    "27 , 2011 at 9:30 am ( `` reconstructing the mind s eye '' ) .",
    "as mentioned earlier , it was selected by the time magazine as one of the best 50 inventions of 2011 and dubbed as `` mind - reading computers '' on the cover page of the time s invention issue .",
    "_ what is really behind the movie reconstruction algorithm ? _    _ can we learn something from it about how brain works ?",
    "_    the movie reconstruction algorithm consists of statistical encoding and decoding models , both of which employ regularization .",
    "the former are sparse models so they are concise enough to be viewed and are built via lasso@xmath7cv for each voxel separately . however , as is well - known lasso@xmath7cv results are not stable or reliable enough for scientific interpretation due to the @xmath8 regularization and the emphasis of cv on prediction performance .",
    "so lasso@xmath7cv is not estimation stable .",
    "the decoding model uses the estimated encoding model for each voxel and tiknohov regularization or ridge in covariance estimation to pull information across different voxels over v1 , v2 and v4 ( nishimoto et al . , @xcite ) .",
    "then an empirical prior for clips of short videos is used from movie trailers and youtube to induce posterior weights on video clips in the empirical prior database .",
    "tiknohov or ridge regularization concerns itself with the estimation of the covariance between voxels that is not of interest for interpretation .",
    "the encoding phase is the focus here from now on.=-1    v1 is a primary visual cortex area and the best understood area in the visual cortex .",
    "hubel and wiesel received a nobel prize in physiology or medicine in 1981 for two major scientific discoveries .",
    "one is hubel and wiesel ( @xcite ) that uses cat physiology data to show , roughly speaking , that simple v1 neuron cells act like gabor filters or as angled edge detectors .",
    "later , using solely image data , olshausen and field ( @xcite ) showed that image patches can be sparsely represented on gabor - like basis image patches .",
    "the appearance of gabor filters in both places is likely not a coincidence , due to the fact that our brain has evolved to represent the natural world .",
    "these gabor filters have different locations , frequencies and orientations .",
    "previous work from the gallant lab has built a filter - bank of such gabor filters and successfully used them to design encoding models with single neuron signals in v1 invoked by static natural image stimuli ( kay et al .",
    ", @xcite , naselaris et al . ,",
    "@xcite ) .    in nishimoto",
    "( @xcite ) , we use fmri brain signals observed over 2700 voxels in different areas of the visual cortex .",
    "fmri signals are indirect and non - invasive measures of neural activities in the brain and have good spatial coverage and temporal resolution in seconds .",
    "each voxel is roughly a cube of 1  mm by 1  mm by 1  mm and contains hundreds of thousands of neurons .",
    "leveraging the success of gabor - filter based models for single neuron brain signals , for a given image , a vector of features is extracted by 2-d wavelet filters .",
    "this feature vector has been used to build encoding models for fmri brain signals in kay et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and naselaris et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "invoked by clips of videos / movies , fmri signals from three subjects are collected with the same experimental set - up . to model fmri signals invoked by movies ,",
    "a 3-dim motion - energy gabor filter bank has been built in nishimoto et al .",
    "( @xcite ) to extract a feature vector of dimension of 26k .",
    "linear models are then built on these features at the observed time point and lagged time points .    at present sparse linear regression models are favorites of the gallant lab through lasso or @xmath9-l2boost .",
    "these sparse models give similar prediction performance on validation data as neural nets and kernel machines on image - fmri data ; they correspond well to the neuroscience knowledge on v1 ; and they are easier to interpret than neural net and kernel machine models that include all features or variables .    for each subject , following a rigorous protocol in the gallant lab , the movie data ( how many frames per second ? ) consists of three batches : training , test and validation .",
    "the training data is used to fit a sparse encoding model via lasso or e - l2boost and the test data is used to select the smoothing parameter by cv .",
    "these data are averages of two or three replicates .",
    "that is , the same movie is played to one subject two or three times and the resulted fmri signals are called replicates .",
    "then a completed encoding determined model is used to predict the fmri signals in the validation data ( with 10@xmath10 replicates ) and the prediction performance is measured by the correlation between the predicted fmri signals and observed fmri signals , for each voxel and for each subject .",
    "good prediction performance is observed for such encoding models ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig : scatter - hist ] ) .",
    "prediction and movie reconstruction are good steps to validate the encoding model in order to understand the human visual pathway .",
    "but the science lies in finding the features that might drive a voxel , or to use tukey s words , finding out `` how things really are . ''",
    "it is often the case that the number of data units is easily different from what is in collected data .",
    "there are some hard resource constraints such as that human subjects can not lie inside an fmri machine for too long and it also costs money to use the fmri machine . but whether the data collected is for 2 hours as in the data or 1 hours 50 min or 2 hours and 10 min is a judgement call by the experimenter given the constraints .",
    "consequently , scientific conclusions , or in our case , candidates for driving features , should be stable relative to removing a small proportion of data units , which is one form of reasonable or appropriate data perturbation , or reproducible without a small proportion of the data units . with a smaller set of data ,",
    "a more conservative scientific conclusion is often reached , which is deemed worthwhile for the sake of more reliable results .",
    "statistics is not the only field that uses mathematics to describe phenomena in the natural world .",
    "other such fields include numerical analysis , dynamical systems and pde and ode .",
    "concepts of stability are central in all of them , implying the importance of stability in quantitative methods or models when applied to real world problems .",
    "the necessity for a procedure to be robust to data perturbation is a very natural idea , easily explainable to a child .",
    "data perturbation has had a long history in statistics , and it has at least three main forms : jacknife , sub - sampling and bootstrap .",
    "huber ( @xcite ) writes in",
    " john w. tukeys contribution to robust statistics :    `` [ tukey ] preferred to rely on the actual batch of data at hand rather than on a hypothetical underlying population of which it might be a sample '' ( p. 1643 ) .",
    "all three main forms of data perturbation rely on an `` actual batch of data '' even though their theoretical analyses do assume hypothetical underlying populations of which data is a sample .",
    "they all have had long histories .",
    "jacknife can be traced back at least to quenouille ( @xcite ) where jacknife was used to estimate the bias of an estimator .",
    "tukey ( @xcite ) , an abstract in the annals of mathematical statistics , has been regarded as a key development because of his use of jacknife for variance estimation .",
    "miller ( @xcite ) is an excellent early review on jacknife with extensions to regression and time series situations .",
    "hinkley ( @xcite ) proposes weighted jacknife for unbalanced data for which wu ( @xcite ) provides a theoretical study .",
    "knsch ( @xcite ) develops jacknife further for time series .",
    "sub - sampling on the other hand was started three years earlier than jacknife by mahalanobis ( @xcite ) .",
    "hartigan ( @xcite ) buids a framework for confidence interval estimation based on subsampling .",
    "carlstein ( @xcite ) applies subsampling ( which he called subseries ) to the time series context .",
    "politis and romano ( @xcite ) study subsampling for general weakly dependent processes .",
    "cross - validation ( cv ) has a more recent start in allen ( @xcite ) and stone ( @xcite ) .",
    "it gives an estimated prediction error that can be used to select a particular model in a class of models or along a path of regularized models .",
    "it has been wildly popular for modern data problems , especially for high - dimensional data and machine learning methods .",
    "hall ( @xcite ) and li ( @xcite ) are examples of theoretical analyses of cv .",
    "( @xcite ) bootstrap is widely used and it can be viewed as simplified jacknife or subsampling .",
    "examples of early theoretical studies of bootstrap are bickel and freedman ( @xcite ) and beran ( @xcite ) for the i.i.d .",
    "case , and knsch ( @xcite ) for time series .",
    "much more on these three data perturbation schemes can be found in books , for example , by efron and tibshirani ( @xcite ) , shao and tu ( @xcite ) and politis , romano and wolf ( @xcite ) .",
    "if we look into the literature of probability theory , the mathematical foundation of statistics , we see 5 that a perturbation argument is central to limiting law results such as the central limit theorem ( clt ) .",
    "the clt has been the bedrock for classical statistical theory .",
    "one proof of the clt that is composed of two steps and is well exposited in terence tao s lecture notes available at his website ( tao , @xcite ) .",
    "given a normalized sum of i.i.d .",
    "random variables , the first step proves the universality of a limiting law through a perturbation argument or the lindebergs swapping trick . that is , one proves that a perturbation in the ( normalized ) sum by a random variable with matching first and second moments does not change the ( normalized ) sum distribution .",
    "the second step finds the limit law by way of solving an ode.=-1    recent generalizations to obtain other universal limiting distributions can be found in chatterjee ( @xcite ) for wigner law under non - gaussian assumptions and in suidan ( @xcite ) for last passage percolation .",
    "it is not hard to see that the cornerstone of theoretical high - dimensional statistics , concentration results , also assumes stability - type conditions . in learning theory ,",
    "stability is closely related to good generalization performance ( devroye and wagner , @xcite , kearns and ron , @xcite , bousquet and elisseeff , @xcite , kutin and niyogi , @xcite , mukherjee et al .",
    ", @xcite , shalev - shwartz et al . , @xcite ) .    to further our discussion on stability , we would like to explain what we mean by statistical stability .",
    "we say statistical stability holds if statistical conclusions are robust or stable to appropriate perturbations to data .",
    "that is , statistical stability is well defined relative to a particular aim and a particular perturbation to data ( or model ) .",
    "for example , aim could be estimation , prediction or limiting law . it is not difficult to have statisticians to agree on what are appropriate data perturbations when data units are i.i.d . or exchangeable in general , in which case subsampling or bootstrap are appropriate",
    ". when data units are dependent , transformations of the original data are necessary to arrive at modified data that are close to i.i.d . or exchangeable , such as in parametric bootstrap in linear models or block - bootstrap in time series .",
    "when subsampling is carried out , the reduced sample size in the subsample does have an effect on the detectable difference , say between treatment and control .",
    "if the difference size is large , this reduction on sample size would be negligible .",
    "when the difference size is small , we might not detect the difference with a reduced sample size , leading to a more conservative scientific conclusion .",
    "because of the utmost importance of reproducibility for science , i believe that this conservatism is acceptable and may even be desirable in the current scientific environment of over - claims .",
    "for the fmri problem , let us recall that for each voxel , lasso or e - l2boost is used to fit the mean function in the encoding model with cv to choose the smoothing parameter .",
    "different model selection criteria have been known to be unstable .",
    "breiman ( @xcite ) compares predictive stability among forward selection , two versions of garotte and ridge and their stability increases in that order .",
    "he goes on to propose averaging unstable estimators over different perturbed data sets in order to stabilize unstable estimators .",
    "such estimators are prediction driven , however , and they are not sparse and thereby not suitable for interpretation .    in place of bootstrap for prediction error estimation as in efron ( @xcite ) , zhang ( @xcite ) uses multi - fold cross - validation while shao ( @xcite ) uses m out of n bootstrap samples with @xmath11",
    ". they then select models with this estimated prediction error , and provide theoretical results for low dimensional or fixed p linear models .",
    "heuristically , the m out of n bootstrap in shao ( @xcite ) is needed because the model selection procedure is a discrete ( or set ) valued estimator for the true model predictor set and hence non - smooth ( cf .",
    "bickel , gtze , and van zwet , @xcite ) .",
    "the lasso ( tibshirani , @xcite ) is a modern model selection method for linear regression and very popular in high - dimensions : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the response vector and @xmath14 is the design matrix .",
    "that is , there are @xmath1 data units and @xmath0 predictors . for each @xmath15 , there is a unique @xmath8 norm for its solution that we can use to index the solution as @xmath16 where @xmath17    cross - validation ( cv ) is used most of the time to select @xmath15 or @xmath18 , but lasso@xmath7cv is unstable relative to bootstrap or subsampling perturbations when predictors are correlated ( cf .",
    "meinshausen and bhlmann , @xcite , bach , @xcite ) . using bootstrap in a different manner than shao ( @xcite ) , bach ( @xcite ) proposes bolasso to improve lasso s model selection consistency property by taking the smallest intersecting model of selected models over different bootstrap samples .",
    "for particular smoothing parameter sequences , the bolasso selector is shown by bach ( @xcite ) to be model selection consistent for the low dimensional case without the irrepresentable condition needed for lasso ( cf .",
    "meinshausen and bhlmann , @xcite , zhao and yu , @xcite ; zou , @xcite ; wainwright , @xcite ) .",
    "meinshausen and bhlmann ( @xcite ) also weaken the irrepresentable condition for model selection consistency of a stability selection criterion built on top of lasso .",
    "they bring perturbations to a lasso path through a random scalar vector in the lasso @xmath8 penalty , resulting in many random lasso paths .",
    "a threshold parameter is needed to distinguish important features based on these random paths .",
    "they do not consider the problem of selecting one smoothing parameter value for lasso as in lim and yu ( @xcite ) .",
    "we would like to seek a specific model along the lasso path to interpret and hence selects a specific @xmath15 or @xmath18 .",
    "it is well known that cv does not provide a good interpretable model because lasso@xmath7cv is unstable .",

    "robust statistics also deals with stability , relative to model perturbation . in the preface of his book `` robust statistics , '' huber ( @xcite ) states :    `` primarily , we are concerned with _ distributional robustness _ : the shape of the true underlying distribution deviates slightly from the assumed model . ''",

    "tukey ( @xcite ) has generally been regarded as the first paper on robust statistics .",

    "what if the `` errors '' have heavier tails than gaussian tails ? for the l1 loss is commonly used in robust statistics to deal with heavier tail errors in regression , we may wonder whether the l1 loss would add more stability to the fmri problem .",

    "it is most interesting to mention that in the proof a `` leave - one - out '' trick is used both row - wise and column - wise such that one by one rows are deleted and similarly columns are deleted . the estimators with deletions",
    "are then compared to the estimator with no deletion .",
    "this is in effect a perturbation argument and reminiscent of the `` swapping trick '' for proving the clt as discussed before .",
    "our analytical derivations involve prox functions , which are reminiscent of the second step in proving normality in the clt .",
    "this is because a prox function is a form of derivative , and not dissimilar to the derivative appearing in the ode derivation of the analytical form of the limiting distribution ( e.g normal distribution ) in the clt .    in the case of i.i.d .",
    "double - exponential errors , el karoui et al .",
    "( @xcite ) numerically solve the two equations in result  [ res1 ] to show that when @xmath62 , @xmath63 loss fitting ( ols ) is better than @xmath8 loss fitting ( lad ) in terms of mse or variance .",
    "they also show that the numerical results match very well with simulation or monte carlo results . at a high level",
    ", we may view that @xmath64 holds the key to this interesting phenomenon .",
    "being a weighted convolution of @xmath65 and @xmath9 , it embeds the interaction between sample variability ( expressed in @xmath65 ) and error variability ( expressed in @xmath9 ) and this interaction is captured in the optimal loss function ( cf .",
    "el karoui et al . , @xcite ) .",
    "in other words , @xmath64 acts more like double exponential when the influence of standard normal @xmath65 in @xmath64 is not dominant ( or when @xmath66 or so as we discover when we solve the equations ) and in this case , the optimal loss function is closer to lad loss . in cases when @xmath67",
    ", it acts more like gaussian noise , leading to the better performance of ols ( because the optimal loss is closer to ls ) .",
    "moreover , for double exponential errors , the m - estimator lad is an mle and we are in a high - dimensional situation .",
    "it is well - known that mle does not work in high - dimensions .",
    "remedies have been found through penalized mle where a bias is introduced to reduce variance and consequently reduce the mse .",
    "in contrast , when @xmath68 , the better estimator ols is also unbiased , but has a smaller variance nevertheless .",
    "the variance reduction is achieved through a better loss function ls than the lad and because of a concentration of quadratic forms of the design matrix .",
    "this concentration does not hold for fixed orthogonal designs , however . a  follow - up work ( bean et al . , @xcite )",
    "addresses the question of obtaining the optimal loss function .",
    "it is current research regarding the performance of estimators from penalized ols and penalized lad when the error distribution is double - exponential .",
    "preliminary results indicate that similar phenomena occur in non - sparse cases .",
    "furthermore , simulations with design matrix from an fmri experiment and double - exponential error show the same phenomenon , that is , when @xmath69 or so , ols is better than lad",
    ". this provides some insurance for using l2 loss function in the fmri project .",
    "it is worth noting that el karoui et al .",
    "( @xcite ) contains results for more general settings .",
    "in this paper , we cover three problems facing statisticians at the 21st century : figuring out how vision works with fmri data , developing a smoothing parameter selection method for lasso , and connecting perturbation in the case of high - dimensional data with classical robust statistics through analytical work .",
    "these three problems are tied together by stability .",
    "stability is well defined if we describe the data perturbation scheme for which stability is desirable , and such schemes include bootstrap , subsampling , and cross - validation .",
    "moreover , we briefly review results in the probability literature to explain that stability is driving limiting results such as the central limit theorem , which is a foundation for classical asymptotic statistics .    using these three problems as backdrop , we make four points .",
    "firstly , statistical stability considerations can effectively aid the pursuit for interpretable and reliable scientific models , especially in high - dimensions .",
    "stability in a broad sense includes replication , repeatability , and different data perturbation schemes .",
    "secondly , stability is a general principle on which to build statistical methods for different purposes .",
    "thirdly , the meaning of stability needs articulation in high - dimensions because it could be brought about by sample variability and/or heavy tails in the errors of a linear regression model .",
    "last but not least , emphasis should be placed on the stability aspects of statistical inference and conclusions , in the referee process of scientific and applied statistics papers and in our current statistics curriculum .",
    "statistical stability in the age of massive data is an important area for research and action because high - dimensions provide ample opportunities for instability to reveal itself to challenge reproducibility of scientific findings .",
