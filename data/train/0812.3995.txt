    "quasi - periodic variabilities have been observed in the timing data of various types of accreting objects .",
    "several types of quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) are observed in x - ray binaries with accreting black holes ( bhs ) or neutron stars ( nss ) ( e.g. , remillard & mcclintock 2006 ; van der klis 2006 ) .",
    "oscillations are also seen in the outbursts of accreting white dwarf ( wd ) systems ( e.g. , patterson 1981 ; see warner 2004 for a review ) .    in accreting ns and bh x - ray binaries the observed qpo frequencies ( @xmath0 hz for the high - frequency qpos in the bh systems and @xmath1 hz for khz qpos in the ns systems ) imply a source close to the central compact object where the keplerian orbital frequencies are high .",
    "since the bh systems lack a hard surface where oscillations may occur , it is likely that the source of the variability is in the inner regions of the disc itself or in some interface regions between the disc and the plunging flow .",
    "gilfanov et al ( 2003 ) , however , found that , based on spectral analysis of the disc emission components , the quasi - periodic variability in low mass ns x - ray binary systems are most likely caused by variations in the disc boundary layer , rather than the disc itself .    in cataclysmic variables ( cvs )",
    "the dwarf nova oscillations ( dnos ) seen during during outbursts have frequencies roughly corresponding to the keplerian rotation rate at the wd surface ( e.g. , patterson , 1981 ; warner , 2004 ; knigge et al , 1998 ) , which imply an origin at or near the inner disk boundary .",
    "several models involving accretion disk boundary dynamics have been proposed in different contexts .",
    "popham ( 1999 ) studied the effect of a non - axysymmetric bulge at the optically thick to optically thin transition radius as a model for dnos .",
    "piro & bildsten ( 2004 ) examined the surface wave oscillations that would occur within the thin equatorial belt around a non - magnetized wd formed by the accretion spreading layer , while warner & woudt ( 2002 ) considered accretion onto a slipping belt . in the context of accreting magnetic ( neutron ) stars , arons & lea ( 1976 ) and",
    "elsner & lamb ( 1977 ) considered the interchange instability at the magnetosphere boundary .",
    "spruit & taam ( 1990 ) and spruit , stehle & papaloizou ( 1995 ) investigated the stability of thin rotating magnetized discs .",
    "of particular relevance to the present paper is the work of li & narayan ( 2004 ) , who examined a simplified cylindrical model of the rayleigh - taylor and kelvin - helmholtz instabilities at the boundary between a magnetosphere and an incompressible rotating flow .",
    "there have also been a number of numerical simulations of the interface at the magnetosphere - disc boundary ( see romanova et al . , 2008 and kulkarni & romanova , 2008 and references therein ) .",
    "in this paper we study global non - axisymmetric oscillation modes confined near inner boundary of the accretion disc ( interface modes ) .",
    "we consider two simple models .",
    "the first model involves the magnetosphere - disc boundary similar to the model of li & narayan ( 2004 ) : we consider an uniformly rotating incompressible magnetosphere with low gas density ( where magnetic pressure dominates ) , which truncates a thin barotropic accretion disc ( where gas pressure dominates ) .",
    "this situation may arise from magnetic field build up due to accretion ( e.g. , bisnovatyi - kogan & ruzmaikin , 1974 , 1976 ; igumenshchev et al .",
    ", 2003 ; rothstein & lovelace , 2008 ) or by the magnetosphere of a central ( neutron ) star . unlike li & narayan ( 2004 ) , who restricted their model to incompressible fluid , our discs are compressible and",
    "we show that because of the differential rotation of the disc , finite disc sound speed plays an important role in the development of the instability of the interface modes .    in our second model",
    "we examine the interface modes for accretion onto a non - magnetic stellar surface . though the structure of the boundary layer is non - trivial and may affect boundary modes ( see , e.g. , carroll et al .",
    ", 1985 ; collins et al . , 2000 ) , we consider the instabilities for a thin disc truncated by a sharp transition to a dense uniformly rotating stellar atmosphere .",
    "this simplified model may provide insight for modes with characteristic radial length scale much greater than the radial length scale of the boundary layer .    in section 2",
    "we describe the basic setup for the magnetospheric boundary model , and in section 3 we discuss the resulting interface mode instabilities .",
    "we describe the star - disc boundary and analyze its possible instabilities in section 4 .",
    "we then conclude in section 5 with a discussion of possible applications of our findings .",
    "we begin by considering a simplified model of the magnetosphere - disc boundary similar to the one considered by li & narayan ( 2004 ) .",
    "the magnetic field is assumed to be negligible in the disc region ( @xmath2 ) , while the magnetosphere region ( @xmath3 ) is assumed to be incompressible and have low density compared to the disc region , with purely vertical magnetic field .",
    "unlike li & narayan ( 2004 ) , who assumed infinite sound speed in the disc , our disc has sound speed @xmath4 much less than the disk rotation speed @xmath5 .    in terms of the vertically integrated density ( @xmath6 ) , pressure ( @xmath7 ) , magnetic field ( @xmath8 ) and fluid velocity ( @xmath9 ) the ideal mhd equations are : + ( ) & = & 0 [ continuity ] + + ( * u * ) * u * & = & - - + [ momentumcon ] + & = & ( * u * ) . where @xmath10 is the total pressure , @xmath11 is the magnetic tension , and @xmath12 is the gravitational potential due to the central object ( e.g. fu & lai , 2008 ) . using cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath13 ) , we consider the case where the magnetic field is purely poloidal and @xmath14 in the disc plane , which gives @xmath15 .",
    "we assume an axisymmetric background flow with fluid velocity @xmath16 .",
    "the unperturbed flow satisfies the condition g_eff - = - ^2 r  .",
    "[ eq4 ]    the linearized equations of ( [ continuity ] ) and ( [ momentumcon ] ) with perturbations of the form @xmath17 ( assuming no vertical dependence ) take the form : -i+ ( r u_r ) + u_&= & 0 [ perturbcons ]  , + -iu_r - 2u_&= & -g_eff - [ perturbmom1 ]  , + -iu_+ u_r & = & - [ perturbmom2 ]  , where @xmath18 is the doppler shifted frequency , @xmath19^{1/2}$ ] is the radial epicyclic frequency , and @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the eulerian perturbations of the fluid variables .",
    "additionally , assuming a barotropic flow we have = p = ( - )  . with the sound speed @xmath23 .",
    "in the inner , magnetically dominated region ( @xmath3 ) , we assume the flow to be incompressible , and have uniform rotation ( @xmath24 const ) and uniform surface density ( @xmath25 const )",
    ". equations ( [ perturbcons ] ) - ( [ perturbmom2 ] ) then reduce to ( r u_r ) + u_&= & 0 [ inner1 ] + -iu_r - 2u_&= & - [ inner2 ] + -iu_+ u_r & = & - [ inner3 ] , as in li & narayan ( 2004 ) we define @xmath26 and find @xmath27 and ( r ) - w = 0  .[weq ] for uniform rotation , @xmath28 , equation ( [ weq ] ) has the solution @xmath29 .",
    "since @xmath3 , we take the positive sign to be the physical solution so that the perturbation falls off away from the interface .",
    "thus the exact solution for the @xmath3 region is u_r = u_r(r_in)()^m-1 .",
    "[ innerdeltau ]      in the disc ( @xmath2 ) , we take the magnetic field to be small , such that @xmath30 , and the angular velocity of the unperturbed flow to be nearly keplerian , such that @xmath31 . rewriting equations",

    ", we obtain the second order ode for the enthalpy perturbation in the disc , h = 0  .",
    "[ perturbeq1 ] where @xmath32 . for concreteness we will assume a power - law disc surface density profile @xmath33 .",
    "the matching conditions across the interface at @xmath34 between the magnetosphere and the disc region are given by demanding the continuity of the lagrangian displacement in the radial direction @xmath35 , and the total lagrangian pressure perturbation @xmath36 across the boundary .",
    "the former gives = [ lag ]  , where the subscript `` @xmath37 '' implifes that the quantities are evaluated at @xmath38 .",
    "the total lagrangian pressure perturbation for @xmath39 is given by _ - & = & _ - _",

    "the condition @xmath40 then gives _",
    "r_in+ = _ - ( - g_eff + ) _ r_in- [ eq29 ] .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]      when the disc is truncated by the star s surface , the effective gravity acts to stabilize the perturbations ( since @xmath41 ) , as does the vorticity .",
    "thus compared to the interface mode in the magnetosphere - disc case ( sections 3.1  3.2 ) , the mode growth rates here are much smaller and are primarily driven by wave propagation through the corotation , beyond the outer lindblad resonance . in the left panels of figure 8",
    "the eigenfrequencies are shown for typical parameters [ @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and disc density index @xmath45 , so that the corotation absorption plays no role .",
    "for other density indices , wave absorption at the corotation can act to either damp or grow the interface modes ( tsang & lai 2008 ; lai & tsang 2008 ) .",
    "for example , in the shakura - sunyaev @xmath46-disc model the disc solution for the outer disc solution ( with free - free opacity and gas pressure dominating ) has the surface density @xmath47 , hence the modes would be stabilized by absorption at the corotation resonance . however , for models where the disc has density index @xmath48 at corotation , the corotational absorption acts to enhance mode growth , as shown in the right panels of figure 8 .",
    "the mode eigenfrequencies have very little dependence on the properties of the stellar atmosphere ( @xmath49 ) , as shown in figure 9 .",
    "the mode frequencies instead primarily depend on the disc sound speed , which in turn depends on the accretion rate .",
    "observations of cvs indicate that dnos are usually only detected in high @xmath50 states , with the oscillation period decreasing with increasing luminosity ( warner 2004 ) .",
    "the downward trend of the @xmath51 as a function of @xmath4 in figure 8 would appear to contradict the observed period - luminosity anti - correlation .",
    "but note that in our model , the interface mode frequency depends on the sound speed at the inner - most disc region and boundary layer , and it will be necessary to model the thermodynamic and radiative properties of the boundary layer in order to compare with observation directly . also , the oscillations of the type considered here would yield periods shorter than the surface keplerian period , except for the @xmath52 mode .",
    "though higher-@xmath53 modes would be more difficult to observe due to the averaging out of the luminosity variation , most observed dnos , even those with 1:2:3 harmonic structure ( warner & woudt , 2005 ) occur with period roughly at or greater than the corresponding surface keplerian period .",
    "these long - period oscillations can not be explained by the model considered here .",
    "we have studied the non - radial oscillation modes at the interface between an accretion disc and a magnetosphere or stellar surface .",
    "although the models explored in this paper are perhaps too simplified compared to realistic situations , they offer some insight into the behavior of the interface modes in various astrophysical contexts .",
    "our study of the interface modes at the magnetosphere - disc boundary extended the work by li & narayan ( 2004 ) , who considered incompressible disc flow ( and therefore could not treat real discs ) .",
    "the model can have very strongly unstable modes due to rayleigh - taylor and kelvin - helmholtz instabilities . in systems where the magnetosphere has developed from advection of frozen magnetic flux",
    ", the magnetosphere is expected to be roughly rotating with at the keplerian rate . since there is no shear at the interface",
    ", only the rayleigh - taylor instability may occur .",
    "however the disc vorticty ( due to differential rotation ) acts to suppress the instability , leading to a cutoff below a critical sound speed .",
    "thus a sufficiently hot disc is required to generate unstable low-@xmath53 modes . for magnetospheres rotating with the central star",
    ", shearing is expected between the magnetosphere and disc , and the kelvin - helmholtz instability becomes active .",
    "this can help to drive the instability for low-@xmath53 modes to overcome the vorticity in low sound - speed discs . in discs that terminate near the isco in a general relativistic potential , the vorticity approaches zero at the inner disc radius , and unstable interface modes can be found for any sound speed .",
    "we can expect a strong dependence of the interface mode growth rates on the sound speed , and thus accretion rate , while the real frequencies of these oscillations remain close to @xmath54 , and do not depend strongly on the sound speed .",
    "it is worth noting that the same boundary condition that gives rise to the interface modes also gives rise to intertial - acoustic modes ( or p - modes ) in the disc .",
    "although higher-@xmath53 interface modes are more unstable in our model , these are less likely to be observed due to the averaging out of the luminosity variation over the observable emitting region .",
    "in addition , if the effect of viscous damping is considered ( e.g. , wang & robertson 1985 ) , small wavelength or high-@xmath53 , perturbations are suppressed .",
    "these results are for perturbations with no vertical structure , and are applicable mainly to the midplane of accretion discs interacting with a magnetosphere . global 3d numerical studies of rayleigh - taylor instability induced accretion onto magnetized stars have been performed by romanova , kulkarni & lovelace ( 2008 ) and kulkarni & romanova ( 2008 ) , and show such small @xmath53 instabilities in the disk midplane .",
    "the low-@xmath53 oscillations at the magnetosphere - disc interface may be relevent to the high - frequency qpos observed in some ns and bh x - ray binary systems ( li & narayan , 2004 ; see section 1 of lai & tsang for a critical review of various theoretical models ) , although to obtain the correct qpo frequencies for the bh systems , the disc inner radius must lie outside the inner - most stable circular orbit .    for the star - disc boundary model considered in in this paper , the interface mode growth rates are much smaller than for the magnetospheric case , since the effective gravity now acts to stabilize the system , and the rayleigh - taylor instability is inactive .",
    "the modes discussed here are unstable due primarily to propagation through the corotation . with sufficiently steep disc density profile ( @xmath33 with @xmath48 ) , corotation absorption can also help to drive these modes , as studed previously by tsang & lai ( 2008 ) and lai & tsang ( 2008 ) .",
    "such modes may be responsible for the high - frequency ( of order the keplerian frequency at the stellar surface ) dwarf nova oscillations observed in cvs , although oscillations with longer periods would require a different explanation .",
    "this work has been supported in part by nasa grant nnx07ag81 g , nsf grant ast 0707628 , and by _ chandra _ grant tm6 - 7004x ( smithsonian astrophysical observatory ) .",
    "consider a system consisting of two fluids in the gravitational field @xmath55 .",
    "the upper fluid @xmath56 has density @xmath57 ( with @xmath58 , where @xmath4 is the sound speed ) and horizontal velocity @xmath59 along the x - axis ; the lower fluid @xmath60 is incompressible with density @xmath61 and horizontal velocity @xmath62 .    the linear perturbation equations for the upper fluid are + ( + * u * ) & = & 0 + + ( * u * ) + ( ) * u*_o & = & -h where @xmath63 . for perturbations of the form @xmath64 ,",
