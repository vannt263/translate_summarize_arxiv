    "previous analysis of results from the @xmath0-dmr  experiment ( smoot  1992 ; bennett  1994 ) has unambiguously demonstrated the existence of cosmological anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "the observed anisotropy is consistent with that predicted by models of structure formation with power law initial fluctuations of gaussian distributed amplitudes and random phases ( bennett  1996 ) .    the sky - rms signal is the simplest statistical measure of cosmological structure that can be computed from the sky maps .",
    "additionally , the observed sky - rms on a given angular scale is , in principle , a convenient quantity to use in the normalization of cosmological models .",
    "however , wright  ( 1994 ) and subsequently banday  ( 1994 ) demonstrated at length that it is essential to account for both instrument specific details , such as the exact beam response function ( rather than using a gaussian approximation , for example ) , and data analysis specific details , such as the subtraction of the best - fit monopole and dipole from the maps , which perturbs the inferred normalization from that derived from standard analytic formulae .    in this @xmath8 , we compute the sky - rms values from the complete four - year @xmath0-dmr  data set and use these values to infer the normalization of a harrison - zeldovich , @xmath9  =  1 , power law model .",
    "emission from the galactic plane dominates the observed sky signal at dmr frequencies but can not be modelled with sufficient accuracy to enable its subtraction . instead , we excise those pixels near the galactic plane where the cmb anisotropy is necessarily contaminated by such emission . for simplicity , previous dmr analyses ( although see hinshaw ; 1995 ) , attempted to minimize the contribution from galactic emission by retaining only those pixels for which the galactic latitude @xmath10 @xmath11 20@xmath1 . however , visual inspection of the dmr maps is suggestive of additional galactic emission from regions lying just outside this cut which are known to exhibit strong emission in the infrared part of the spectrum .",
    "cayn & smoot ( 1995 ) noted two regions associated with known galactic structure which showed non - cmb frequency dependence and were therefore likely to be galactic in origin .",
    "such features will inevitably contaminate the measured sky anisotropy amplitude , and therefore we have attempted to excise them from the four - year analysis .",
    "kogut  ( 1996a ) have demonstrated a correlation between free - free and dust emission as traced by the @xmath12 long wavelength ( 100 , 140 and 240 @xmath3 m ) sky maps at high galactic latitudes .",
    "furthermore , haslam & osborne ( 1987 ) noted a strong association in the spatial distributions of the emission from the inner galactic plane as recorded by the @xmath13 60 @xmath3 m survey and radio surveys at 2.7 and 5 ghz .",
    "this correlation with the thermal emission suggests that the dust responsible for the diffuse ir emission in the plane is mixed with ionized gas from extended low density hii regions . on the basis of these arguments",
    ", we have used the @xmath12 140 @xmath3 m sky map ( after a model of zodiacal emission has been removed  reach , 1995 ) to trace the strong galactic emission around the galactic plane . to maintain continuity with earlier treatments",
    ", we also remove all pixels at latitudes @xmath14 .",
    "we find that the additional regions to be excluded from our analysis are the flares of obscuration noted by de vaucouleurs ( 1956 ) in scorpius and ophiuchus in the northern galactic hemisphere and taurus and orion in the south .",
    "the new cut leaves 3881 surviving pixels in galactic coordinates , and 3890 in ecliptic[multiblock footnote omitted ] .",
    "the @xmath0-dmr  four - year sky maps are used in the present investigation .",
    "kogut  ( 1996b ) have demonstrated that the corresponding systematic error contributions are small , and we ignore them in this analysis ( the 68% upper limit at 7@xmath1  is @xmath15 1.4 @xmath3k ) .",
    "a discussion of the effect of residual high latitude galactic emission is deferred until section 5 .",
    "however , we note that since synchrotron , dust and free - free galactic emission have spatial morphologies characterized by a steeply falling power spectrum ( @xmath16  kogut  1996a ) , only structure on large angular scales is compromised . as a simple initial test of the extent to which galactic emission affects our results , we perform all computations both including and excluding the observed quadrupole .",
    "the analysis proceeds as described for the two - year data in banday  ( 1994 ) where the cross - rms , @xmath17 , between two maps @xmath18 and @xmath19 is defined in their eqn ( 1 ) . the data without additional smoothing is referred to as 7@xmath1  smoothing , since the central lobe of the dmr beam is _ approximately _ described by a 7@xmath1  fwhm gaussian .",
    "for determining the sky - rms at 10@xmath1 , the data surviving the galactic cut are smoothed by a 7@xmath1  fwhm gaussian kernel with uniform weighting .",
    "table 1 shows the observed @xmath17  values determined from independent sky maps at 31.5 , 53 and 90 ghz constructed from the first two years and second two years of @xmath0-dmr  data .",
    "the results are consistent with the presence of sky signal in all four years of data .",
    "we have computed a frequency dependence in the @xmath17of the form @xmath20 between pairs of frequencies . since the three dmr frequencies span the expected minimum in the galactic foreground emission ( see fig . 2 in bennett  1992 and fig . 3 in kogut  1996a )",
    "then an average spectral index @xmath21 computed over the three frequencies could appear flat even with considerable contamination and erroneously be ascribed to a small galactic contribution .",
    "the lack of any frequency dependence in the @xmath17  ( expressed in thermodynamic temperature units ) without any correction for galactic emissions is consistent with the dominant signal being cosmic in origin[multiblock footnote omitted ] .",
    "in this _ letter _ we restrict our attention to the inference of the @xmath5  normalization for the @xmath9 = 1 power spectrum model . the analytical form of the probability distribution of the @xmath0-dmr  data analysis specific @xmath17  statistic is unmanagable .",
    "a monte carlo approach was adopted to generate the @xmath17  distributions for a grid of @xmath5  values ( with 5000 simulations used for each value of @xmath5 ) .",
    "each simulation generates maps of the sky temperature distribution by combining a realization of harrison - zeldovich sky anisotropy filtered through the @xmath0-dmrbeam ( wright  1994 ) .",
    "the expected variance of the spherical harmonic coefficients of the cmb temperature in this case is given by @xmath22 $ ] ( abbott & wise 1984 ) .",
    "noise realizations are based on the appropriate values of the rms per observation and observation patterns of the specific dmr channels .",
    "the effects of noise correlations ( lineweaver  1994 , grski  1996a ) are not significant for this work and hence are not included in the simulations .",
    "the @xmath5-dependent statistical means , variances and covariances of the 7@xmath1  and 10@xmath1  @xmath17are derived from these monte carlo simulations , and used to construct the gaussian approximation to the probability distribution of the @xmath17 .",
    "this , together with the measured @xmath17  values , defines the likelihood function @xmath23(@xmath5 ) .",
    "we consider @xmath17  values computed between the a and b channels at each of the three frequencies , between the 53 and 90 ghz ( a+b)/2 or sum ( s ) maps , and between a and b maps made by coadding the corresponding sides at the three frequencies .",
    "the inverse - noise - variance weights for the 31.5 , 53 and 90 ghz maps in thermodynamic temperature are then ( 0.090,0.718,0.192 ) and ( 0.062,0.588,0.350 ) for the a and b channels respectively .",
    "table 2 summarizes the four - year @xmath17  values and the inferred maximum likelihood values of @xmath5 .",
    "the small observed differences between the galactic and ecliptic values are expected since there is some noise rebinning depending on the pixelization scheme .",
    "the normalizations determined at each frequency or from combinations of frequency agree at the @xmath24 level .",
    "these values are completely consistent with previous analyses based on either the first year or first two years of data , lying between these earlier normalizations , and are in excellent agreement with values derived by more sensitive techniques using the four - year data ( see the accompanying papers grski  1996b ; hinshaw  1996 ; wright  1996 ) . since any likelihood technique is only unbiased asymptotically , we have tested the @xmath17  technique described above with an additional set of simulations with noise levels appropriate to the 53s@xmath2590s combination .",
    "there is evidence for a small , statistically significant bias ( uncorrected in table 2 ) to a lower @xmath5 . over a range of input normalizations from 15 to 20 @xmath3k ,",
    "the bias is typically @xmath15 0.2 @xmath3k .",
    "the bias is sensitive to the signal - to - noise ratio , which is why banday  1994 saw no evidence for this effect in their analysis of the two - year data    an additional check on the bias correction can be determined from a one - dimensional version of the ( @xmath5 , @xmath9 ) matching technique described in wright  ( 1996 ) .",
    "the cosmic part of a simulated map can be considered as a function of @xmath5 .",
    "thus , the @xmath17value of a simulation and the resultant inferred quadrupole normalization generated by processing through the standard maximum likelihood ( @xmath26 ) machinery , ( @xmath27 ) , is itself a function of @xmath5 . for any given sky realization",
    ", we can choose a normalization amplitude ",
    "@xmath28  which results in the same inferred normalization as the real data . for 2500 simulations matched to the observed sky signal , the mean @xmath28 is a good estimate of @xmath5 . for the 53s@xmath2590s galactic combination ,",
    "we find @xmath5  = @xmath29 @xmath3k  ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "a comparison of results including or excluding the quadrupole shows evidence of a systematic shift to a lower @xmath5  normalization when the quadrupole is included .",
    "the effect should not be considered as surprising , however .",
    "kogut  ( 1996c ) have demonstrated that the cosmic quadrupole is counter - aligned to the galactic quadrupole , and thus the quadrupole as observed in sky - maps uncorrected for galactic contamination is not representative of the cmb quadrupole . whilst the shift is within the range of uncertainties expected from noise and cosmic variance",
    ", it undoubtedly reflects the partial cancellation of galactic and cosmological quadrupoles . furthermore , since the rms estimator ( at a given resolution ) compresses all of the available information in the data to one number , it is very sensitive to the @xmath31 = 2 mode . a simple calculation ( not accounting for noise or sky - coverage ) for an @xmath9 = 1 spectrum shows that @xmath15 23% of the sky variance over the spectral range @xmath32 [ 2,40 ] is contributed by the quadrupole .",
    "the inferred value for @xmath5  using the @xmath17  technique is therefore sensitive to the choice of quadrupole amplitude in the sky - maps .",
    "we have estimated this bias using a set of simulations where the power spectrum normalization has been varied over the range 15 - 20 @xmath3k , whilst the realization specific quadrupole amplitude was constrained to lie in the range [ 4 , 28 ] @xmath3k  ( kogut  1996c ) .",
    "the sample data sets processed through the maximum likelihood machinery yielded biases in the range -1.4 to -2.8 @xmath3k , sufficiently large to correct @xmath5  and reconcile the normalizations .",
    "if we attempt a more specific correction , the foreground emission can be modelled using the @xmath12 - 140 @xmath3 m sky map as a template for free - free and dust emission , and a full - sky radio survey at 408 mhz ( haslam  1981 ) to trace the synchrotron contribution ( see kogut  1996b for discussion ) .",
    "after subtraction of the appropriate galactic contribution , the normalization amplitudes including or excluding the quadrupole are in better agreement ( fig .",
    "1 ) : correcting the dmr maps for galactic emission increases the cmb quadrupole .",
    "the galactic correction is itself subject to considerable uncertainty , and when taken into account @xmath33 @xmath5  values are consistent with @xmath15 18 @xmath3k .",
    "in summary , we have used the @xmath17  statistic derived from the @xmath0-dmr  four - year sky maps to infer a normalization @xmath5  @xmath15 18 @xmath3k  ( with a typical significance of @xmath34 ) for the amplitude of primordial inhomogeneity in the context of a harrison - zeldovich @xmath9 = 1 model .",
    "the sensitivity of the @xmath17  method to the galaxy contaminated observed sky quadrupole affords a reasonable explanation for the difference in inferred @xmath5amplitudes when either including or excluding the quadrupole .",
    "normalizations inferred from both galactic and ecliptic coordinate data sets at all frequencies agree at better than the @xmath24 level .",
