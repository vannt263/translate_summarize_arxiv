    "the main goal of this paper is to examine the effect of knot mutation on two concordance invariants of knots , the 4ball genus and the algebraic concordance class . in the first case",
    "the extent to which mutation can change the 4genus is completely described . in the second case",
    "it is shown that the algebraic concordance class of a knot , as defined by levine  @xcite , is invariant under mutation .",
    "in the course of our work we develop crossing change formulas for algebraic knot invariants . in the final sections of this paper we apply such an approach to demonstrate that long s theorem that strongly positive amphicheiral knots are algebraically slice is an immediate corollary of the hartley - kawauchi theorem that such knots have alexander polynomials that are squares .",
    "lastly , we show that the hartley - kawauchi theorem also follows from a similar crossing change approach .",
    ".1 in _ mutation and algebraic concordance . _",
    "the construction of a mutant @xmath2 of a knot @xmath3 consists of removing a 3ball @xmath4 from @xmath5 that meets @xmath3 in two proper arcs and gluing it back in via an involution @xmath6 of its boundary @xmath7 , where @xmath6 is orientation preserving and leaves the set @xmath8 invariant .",
    "this is among the most subtle constructions of knot theory in that it leaves a wide range of knot invariants unchanged  @xcite .",
    "most relevant to the work here is the statement of  @xcite that the tristram - levine signatures , @xmath9 , are invariant under mutation , since , for @xmath10 a prime power root of unity , these provide the strongest classical bounds on the 4genus  @xcite : @xmath11 . in sections  [ algcon ] and  [ algcon3 ]",
    "we give proofs of the more general result :    [ algcon2 ] for any knot @xmath3 , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is levine s homomorphism from the knot concordance group to the algebraic concordance group  @xcite .",
    "the proof of section  [ algcon ] is entirely self - contained and in addition gives a previously unnoticed crossing change formula for the algebraic concordance class of a knot .",
    "( as a side note , in section  [ smaph ] we use this crossing change formula to give a quick derivation of a result of long that strongly positive amphicheiral knots are algebraically slice . ) in section  [ algcon3 ] an alternate proof of theorem  [ algcon2 ] is presented ; this argument is somewhat briefer , but depends on the detailed analysis of seifert forms given in  @xcite .",
    ".1 in _ mutation and the 4-genus of a knot . _",
    "the 4genus of a knot , @xmath14 , is the minimum genus of an embedded surface bounded by @xmath3 in the 4ball .",
    "this can be defined in either the smooth or topological locally flat category ; the results of this paper apply in either .",
    "it is an especially challenging invariant to compute ; there remain low crossing number knots for which it is uncomputed , though the smooth category has advanced considerably in recent years , most notably with the solution of the milnor conjecture which gives the 4genus of torus knots  @xcite .",
    "almost nothing has been known concerning the interplay between mutation and the 4genus .",
    "basically the only success in this realm consists of kearton s observation  @xcite that an example of  @xcite yields an example for which mutation changes the concordance class of a knot .",
    "a close examination of that example shows that it has 4genus 1 , but it has a mutant of 4genus 0 .",
    "further such examples have since been developed in  @xcite .",
    "our main result regarding the 4genus is the following .",
    "[ mainthm ] for every pair of nonnegative integers @xmath0 and @xmath1 , there is a knot @xmath3 with mutant @xmath2 satisfying @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "it should be noted that the original argument of  @xcite was based on a paper of gilmer  @xcite in which it is now known an error appears . to correct for that , the argument of  @xcite",
    "should be based on a 3fold branched cover rather than the 2fold cover .",
    "the present work thus serves to give the corrected argument for  @xcite .",
    ".1 in _ strongly positive amphicheiral knots . _ a knot @xmath3 is called strongly positive amphicheiral if when viewed as a knot in @xmath17 it has a representative that is invariant under the map of @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "we consider two theorems :    if @xmath3 is strongly positive amphicheiral , then @xmath3 is algebraically slice .    if @xmath3 is a strongly positive amphicheiral knot , then the alexander polynomial @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is a symmetric polynomial .",
    "in section  [ smaph ] we use crossing change formulas developed earlier to prove that long s theorem is an immediate corollary of the hartley - kawauchi result . in section  [ smaph2 ]",
    "we use a crossing change argument to give a new proof of the hartley - kawauchi theorem .",
    "a key tool in the proof of theorem  [ mainthm ] is the main theorem from  @xcite bounding casson - gordon invariants in terms of the 4genus of a knot .",
    "here is a simplified description of that result , based on the statement of the theorem and later remarks in  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath3 be an algebraically slice knot such that @xmath21 and let @xmath22 be the @xmath23fold branched cover of @xmath5 branched over @xmath3 with @xmath23 a prime power .",
    "let @xmath24 denote the linking form on @xmath25 .",
    "then @xmath26 can be written as a direct sum @xmath27 such that 1 ) @xmath28 has a presentation of rank @xmath29 and 2 ) @xmath30 has a metabolizer @xmath31 such that for any character @xmath32 of prime power order on @xmath33 given by linking with an element in @xmath31 , one has:@xmath34    here @xmath35 is the casson - gordon invariant , originally denoted @xmath36 in  @xcite .",
    "we will need to know that @xmath31 can be taken to be equivariant with respect to the deck transformation of @xmath22 .",
    "details concerning this and other points will be given below , as they arise .    in our applications",
    "the group @xmath25 will also be a vector space over a finite field , in which case a metabolizer for @xmath30 will be half - dimensional . hence :    in the statement of gilmer s theorem , if @xmath37 , a @xmath38vector space , then the conclusion of ( 1 ) can be restated as 1 ) @xmath39 and in ( 2 ) the metabolizer @xmath31 satisfies @xmath40 .",
    "figure  [ knot1 ] illustrates a knot @xmath41 of genus 1 .",
    "the bands in the surface are tied in knots @xmath42 and @xmath43 , for a knot @xmath42 to be determined later .",
    "the twisting of the bands is such that the seifert matrix for @xmath41 is @xmath44        .05 in    knots related to this one have been carefully analyzed elsewhere , for example  @xcite , and the details of the following results can be found there . here",
    "are the relevant facts .    1 .",
    "if @xmath45 denotes the 3fold branched cover of @xmath5 branched over @xmath41 , then @xmath46 .",
    "2 .   as a @xmath47vector space , @xmath48 splits as the direct sum of a 2eigenspace , spanned by a vector @xmath49 , and a 4eigenspace , spanned by a vector @xmath50 , with respect to the linear transformation induced by the deck transformation .",
    "3 .   linking with @xmath51 induces a character @xmath52 .",
    "results of litherland  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) give the following : @xmath53 @xmath54 here @xmath55 denotes the classical levine - tristram signature , also written as @xmath9 with @xmath56 . to simplify notation we abbreviate , for any knot @xmath42 , @xmath57 there are knots for which @xmath58 is arbitrarily large , for instance connected sums of trefoil knots .",
    "we denote by @xmath59 the connected sum of @xmath60 with its mirror image , reversed : @xmath61 as observed by kearton , @xmath59 is a mutant of the slice knot @xmath62 .    for any choice of @xmath42 , @xmath63 and thus @xmath64 .",
    ".05 in    figure  [ knot2 ] illustrates @xmath59 . a simple closed curve on the genus 2 seifert surface @xmath20 is indicated .",
    "this curve has self - linking number 0 and represents the slice knot @xmath65 .",
    "thus @xmath20 can be surgered in the 4ball to reduce its genus to 1 , showing that @xmath59 bounds a surface of genus 1 in the 4ball , as desired .",
    "the homology of the 3fold branched cover of @xmath59 , @xmath66 , naturally splits as @xmath67 with a 2eigenspace spanned by the vectors @xmath68 and @xmath69 , which we abbreviate simply by @xmath49 and @xmath70 .",
    "similarly for the 4eigenspace .",
    "we denote the corresponding @xmath47valued characters given by linking with @xmath49 and @xmath70 by @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively .",
    "the casson - gordon invariants of @xmath59 are given by : @xmath73 @xmath74 where @xmath75 or @xmath76 depending on whether @xmath77 or @xmath78 mod 7 .",
    "this follows from the additivity of casson - gordon invariants ; see  @xcite or  @xcite .",
    "the only unexpected aspect of the formula is that , since we have @xmath79 , it might have been anticipated that the difference @xmath80 would appear rather than the sum .",
    "this switch occurs because the connected sum involves the mirror image of reverse , rather than simply the mirror image ; thus the role of @xmath42 and @xmath43 are reversed in the second summand .",
    "as observed by kearton , for any knots @xmath81 and @xmath82 , the connected sums @xmath83 and @xmath84 are mutants of each other .",
    "hence , it follows immediately that for @xmath85 , @xmath86 is a mutant of @xmath87 .",
    "since @xmath88 is slice , this second knot is concordant to , and hence of the same 4genus as , @xmath89 . to prove theorem  [ mainthm ] we show that for each positive integer @xmath1 there exists a knot @xmath42 so that for all @xmath90 , @xmath91 .",
    "at this point we fix some positive integer @xmath1 and select an arbitrary @xmath0 , @xmath92 . the knot @xmath42 will be chosen as its necessary properties become apparent .",
    "suppose that @xmath93 bounds a surface @xmath20 in the 4-ball with genus @xmath94 .",
    "let @xmath95 denote the 3fold branched cover of @xmath96 branched over @xmath20 , having boundary the @xmath0fold connected sum , @xmath97 .",
    "also , abbreviate by @xmath31 the image of tor(@xmath98 ) in @xmath99 .",
    "an examination of the proof of gilmer s theorem in  @xcite reveals that this @xmath31 is the metabolizer given in our statement of his theorem above .",
    "thus , for any @xmath32 corresponding to an element in @xmath31 we have @xmath100 .    with @xmath47coefficients , @xmath99 has dimension @xmath101 , so by gilmer s theorem we have @xmath102 .",
    "hence , since @xmath103 , we have that @xmath31 is nontrivial .",
    "observe that by its construction , @xmath31 is equivariant with respect to the deck transformation and hence contains an eigenvector .",
    "assume that it is a 2eigenvector .",
    "if we write @xmath104 then the 2-eigenvectors are naturally denoted @xmath105 and @xmath106 , with @xmath107 , where @xmath105 and @xmath106 are the 2eigenvector in the @xmath108th summand .",
    "a nontrivial 2eigenvector in @xmath31 will be of the form @xmath109 .",
    "using additivity , the casson - gordon invariant corresponding to the dual character is given by : @xmath110    to complete the proof , observe that this sum is greater than or equal to @xmath111 , so that if @xmath42 is chosen so that @xmath112 a contradiction is achieved . notice that the choice of @xmath42 depends only on @xmath1 and not @xmath0 .",
    "a similar argument applies if @xmath31 contains only a 4eigenvector .",
    "for a general knot @xmath3 one has @xmath114 but one does not usually have an equality . in the case of a knot @xmath115 , such as the trefoil , for which the 4genus is detected by a classical ( additive ) invariant , such as the signature , one can sometimes demonstrate that @xmath116 .",
    "but for algebraically slice knots with @xmath117 such arguments are not possible .",
    "in fact , it is unknown whether in the topological category there is such an algebraically slice knot for which the equality holds for all @xmath1 .",
    "( in the smooth setting the second author , in  @xcite , has constructed an algebraically slice knot @xmath3 for which @xmath118 , where @xmath6 is the invariant defined by ozvth and szab  @xcite .",
    "since @xmath6 is additive and bounds @xmath119 , it follows that @xmath120 for all @xmath1 . )",
    "we will here observe that one can come quite close for the knot @xmath121 , where @xmath121 is the knot illustrated in figure  [ knot4 ] , built as @xmath41 is , only with @xmath42 tied in both bands rather than @xmath42 in one band and @xmath43 in the other .",
    "( similar results hold for @xmath41 and @xmath59 but the proof would require the continued use of 3fold covers rather than the 2fold cover for which the estimates are simpler . )",
    ".05 in    for all @xmath122 with @xmath123 , there is a knot @xmath42 such that @xmath124 for all @xmath125 .",
    "our proof builds upon gilmer s original argument  @xcite .",
    "observe first that @xmath126 .",
    "for the 2fold branched cover we have that @xmath127 and the @xmath128dimension satisfies @xmath129 .",
    "if @xmath130 bounds a surface in the 4ball of genus @xmath131 less than or equal to @xmath132 , then by gilmer s theorem there exists a self  annihilating summand @xmath31 with dim(@xmath133dim@xmath134 such that for all characters @xmath32 dual to elements in @xmath31 , one has @xmath135    one computes that @xmath136 . a linear algebra argument , basically gauss - jordan elimination , now implies that some element of @xmath31 will be of the form @xmath137 with at least @xmath138 of the @xmath139 nontrivial , and for each of these @xmath139 the corresponding casson - gordon invariant is at least @xmath140 .",
    "thus we have the equation @xmath141    since @xmath142 , this reduces to @xmath143 simplifying yields @xmath144 the proof is completed by noting that for any @xmath122 one can select a @xmath42 for which this inequality does not hold .",
    "in this section we develop a crossing change formula for the algebraic concordance class of a knot in order to prove theorem  [ algcon2 ] : mutation preserves that algebraic concordance class of a knot .",
    "certain knot invariants , such as the alexander polynomial and tristram - levine signatures , provide algebraic concordance invariants , and these have been shown to be mutation invariants ( see for instance  @xcite ) but the general question of whether mutation can change the algebraic concordance class has remained open .",
    "we should note that changing a knot to its orientation reverse is a very special case of mutation and reversal does not change the algebraic concordance class of a knot , as follows from work of long  @xcite .",
    "( more directly , it can be shown that the complete set of algebraic concordance invariants defined by levine  @xcite are unchanged by matrix transposition , the operation on seifert matrices induced by reversal . )    in the first subsection here we present a proof that the normalized alexander polynomial is invariant under mutation .",
    "this argument is not new but must be presented to set up the needed notation for the analysis of algebraic concordance that follows .",
    "the second subsection presents a review of the theory and algebra of levine s algebraic concordance group @xmath145  @xcite . in the final subsection we present a crossing change formula for the algebraic concordance class of a knot and use this to prove the mutation invariance of this class .",
    ".1 in      for an oriented link @xmath146 , a choice of connected seifert surface @xmath20 for @xmath146 and a choice of basis for @xmath147 there is a seifert matrix @xmath148 , say of dimension @xmath149 .",
    "the ( normalized ) alexander polynomial of @xmath146 , @xmath150 , can be defined by setting @xmath151 @xmath152 where @xmath153 denotes the transpose , @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",
    "( recall that @xmath150 can be expressed as a polynomial in @xmath156 , @xmath157 $ ] , and this defines the conway polynomial  @xcite . )",
    "notice that @xmath158 , so that if @xmath159 is even ( for instance , when @xmath146 is connected , @xmath160 ) ) @xmath161 $ ] and elementary algebraic manipulations then result in the usual normalized alexander polynomial : @xmath162 ( this polynomial is clearly independent of change of basis and an observation below will show that it is an @xmath7equivalence invariant  @xcite and thus depends only on @xmath3 . )        .05 in    @xmath163 @xmath164 .95 in @xmath165    figure  [ cchange ] illustrates a local picture of link diagrams for links @xmath163 , @xmath164 , and @xmath165 , with the diagrams identical outside the local picture . any crossing change and smoothing can be achieved using this local change . in the diagram for @xmath163",
    "a reidemeister move eliminates the two crossings .",
    "if seifert s algorithm is used to construct a seifert surface @xmath166 for @xmath163 using this simplified diagram , the corresponding seifert matrix will be denoted @xmath167 .",
    "the seifert surfaces for the links @xmath163 and @xmath164 that arise from seifert s algorithm applied to the given diagrams are formed from @xmath166 by adding two twisted bands . from this",
    "we have that @xmath168 is given by a @xmath169 matrix of the form :    @xmath170 v(l _ ) = (    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     ) . @xmath170",
    "this form has a metabolizer generated by the vector @xmath171 , and hence it is trivial in the witt group , as desired .",
    "here we present a combinatorial proof of the theorem that for strongly positive amphicheiral knots the alexander polynomial is a square of an alexander polynomial .",
    "the proof also gives an alternative , though longer , route to long s theorem than was given in the previous section .",
    "we begin by considering the existence of an equivariant seifert surface for such a knot .",
    "if seifert s algorithm for constructing a seifert surface is applied to a diagram for a strongly amphicheiral knot that is invariant under @xmath6 , the resulting surface will be invariant .",
    "in addition , @xmath6 restricted to this surface is orientation preserving since @xmath6 preserves the orientation of the knot that is the boundary of the surface .",
    "however @xmath6 reverses the positive normal direction since it reverses the orientation of @xmath172 .",
    "thus we have the following .",
    "[ theta - tau ] let @xmath3 be a strongly positive amphicheiral knot with involution @xmath6 .",

    "figure  [ knot6 ] represents a portion of a symmetric diagram of a strongly amphicheiral knot , say @xmath176 .",
    "the dot in center of the figure represents the origin in @xmath172 , the center of symmetry .        for the knot @xmath177 the diagram will be the same , only a symmetric pair of crossing changes has been made .",
    "thus , for @xmath177 the clasps pull apart , leaving a knot , denoted @xmath178 , with diagram as illustrated in figure  [ knot5 ] .",
    "suppose that @xmath178 has an equivariant seifert surface @xmath166 given by seifert s algorithm and @xmath179 has symplectic basis @xmath180 .",
    "then an equivariant seifert surface @xmath20 for @xmath176 is given by adding four bands to @xmath166 .",
    "the basis for @xmath179 can be naturally extended to symplectic one for @xmath181 , @xmath182 , where @xmath183 has trivial seifert pairing with all elements other than @xmath184 and itself , and @xmath184 has trivial seifert pairing with @xmath185 .",
