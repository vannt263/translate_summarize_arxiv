    "note that there is in general no simple relation between the behavior of pure state entanglement entropy and operator - space entanglement entropy . only in the special case of rank - one projection operators @xmath71 we find a simple relation , namely that operator - space von neumann entanglement entropy of @xmath72 equals two times entanglement entropy of @xmath73 .",

    "our results indicate that the interaction does not destroy localization , at least for large disorder .",
    "this appears to be in contrast with the predicted metal - insulator transition at a finite @xmath80 in the corresponding fermionic system  @xcite .",
    "however , in light of observed logarithmic growth of entanglement entropies with time we can not exclude another possibility of very small diffusion constant and , in strict sense , absence of localization .",
    "yet , another possibility would be existence of localization delocalization transition at smaller disorder strength @xmath89 , but this regime is much harder to simulate with the present method as entanglement entropies increase faster for smaller @xmath89 .    still , we were able to verify that the entropy grows logarithmically also for smaller fields , _",

    ". if this is the case , transition in level spacing statistics observed in  @xcite might be just due to finite size effects ( localization length being larger than the system size ) .",
    "we have also checked that the results of correlation functions , in the regimes which we show , do not significantly depend on the system size @xmath74 .",
