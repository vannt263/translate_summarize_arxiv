    "three - dimensional fluid dynamic simulations of turbulent convection in an oxygen - burning shell of a presupernova star show bursty fluctuations which are not seen in one - dimensional stellar evolutionary calculations ( which use various versions of mixing - length theory , mlt , @xcite ) .",
    "this paper explores the underlying physics of this new phenomena .    since the formulation of mlt @xcite ,",
    "there have been a number of significant developments in the theoretical understanding of turbulent convective flow .",
    "first , @xcite and @xcite developed the modern version of the turbulent cascade , and published in journals easily accessible in the west ; the original theory @xcite was not used in mlt although it pre - dated it . this explicit expression for dissipation of turbulent velocities ,",
    "@xmath1 where @xmath2 is the root - mean - square of the turbulent velocity and @xmath3 is the dissipation length .",
    "it is found both experimentally and numerically that @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the depth of the convective zone .",
    "simulations for low - mach number flow show that the average of this dissipation over the convective zone closely compensates for the corresponding average of the buoyant power @xcite .",
    "this additional constraint allows an alternative to present practice : fixing the free parameter ( e.g. , the mixing length factor @xmath6 ) directly by terrestrial experiments and numerical simulations which deal with the process of turbulence itself @xcite , instead of calibrating it from complex astronomical systems ( stellar atmospheres ) as is now done .",
    "second , there has been a considerable development in understanding the nature of chaotic behavior in nonlinear systems ; see @xcite for a review and reprints of original papers , and @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented a simplified solution to the rayleigh problem of thermal convection @xcite which captured the seed of chaos in the lorenz attractor , and contains a representation of the fluctuating aspect of turbulence not present in mlt .",
    "this advance was allowed by the steady increase in computer power and accessibility , which lead to the exploration of solutions for simple systems of nonlinear differential equations ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it became clear that the landau picture @xcite of the approach to turbulence was incorrect both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .",
    "a striking feature of these advances has been the use of simple mathematical models , which capture the essence of chaos in a model with much reduced dimensionality compared to the physical system of interest .",
    "third , it has become possible to simulate turbulence on computers .",
    "this realizes the vision of john von neumann @xcite , in which numerical solutions of the navier - stokes equations by computer are used to inform mathematical analysis of turbulence . in this paper",
    "we will follow this idea of von neumann , in the style which proved successful for chaos studies : building simple mathematical models of a more complex physical system ( in this case , the numerical simulations of turbulent convection ) .",
    "this approach should lead to algorithms suitable for implementation into stellar evolution codes , which , unlike mlt , are ( 1 ) based upon solutions to fluid dynamics equations , ( 2 ) non - local , ( 3 ) time - dependent , and ( 4 ) falsifiable by terrestrial experiment and future improved simulations .",
    "our particular example is a set of simulations of oxygen burning in a shell of a star of @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this is of astronomical interest in its own right as a model for a supernova progenitor , but also happens to represent a relatively simple and computationally efficient case , and has general implications for the convection process in all stars .",
    "three - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of shell oxygen burning exhibit bursty , recurrent fluctuations in turbulent kinetic energy ( @xcite and below ) .",
    "the reason for this behavior has not been explained theoretically .",
    "these simulations show a damping , and eventual cessation , of turbulent motion if we artificially turn off the nuclear burning @xcite .",
    "further investigation @xcite shows that nearly identical pulsations are obtained with a volumetric energy generation rate which is constant in time , so that _ the cause of the pulsation is independent of any temperature or composition dependence in the oxygen burning rate .",
    "_ localized heating is necessary to drive the convection ; even with this time - independent rate of heating , pulses in the turbulent kinetic energy still occur .    such behavior is fundamentally different from traditional nuclear - energized pulsations dealt with in the literature ( e.g. ,",
    "the @xmath8-mechanism , @xcite ) , and is a consequence of time - dependent turbulent convection ( it might be called a `` @xmath0-mechanism '' , with @xmath0 standing for turbulence ) .",
    "it appears to be relevant to all stellar convection .",
    "@xcite found , in a very different context , that non - linear interaction of the largest modes excited pulsations of a red - giant envelope - mechanism , which depends upon variations in opacity , is not required to drive such pulsations .",
    "] , which is another example of the @xmath0-mechanism .    in section  2",
    "we examine the the physics context of the turbulence , including implications of subgrid and turbulent dissipation for the implicit large eddy simulations ( iles ) upon which our analysis is based , and the effect of the convective mach number on the nature of the flow . in section  3 we review the 3d numerical results of shell oxygen burning which are relevant to the theory . in section  4",
    "we present the results of the classical lorenz model @xcite for conditions similar to those in section  3 . in section  5",
    "we consider implications of turbulent intermittency on stellar variability , and provide a model light curve from this effect alone .",
    "section  6 summarizes the results .",
    "the appendix gives a short derivation of the lorenz model .",
    "in this section we summarize concepts which are needed for the interpretation of later results .",
    "approximation of partial differential equations by discrete methods inevitably leads to a loss of information at scales smaller than the grid size .",
    "a single element in space is approximated as a homogeneous entity ; this is equivalent to complete mixing at this scale , at each time step , of mass , momentum , and energy .",
    "the loss of information that occurs with this mixing corresponds to an increase in entropy @xcite , the mixing of momentum is equivalent to the action of viscosity , and the mixing of internal energy corresponds to the transport of heat ( @xcite ,  15 and  49 ) .    in 3d flow",
    ", turbulent energy will cascade from large scales to small , at a rate set by the largest scales @xcite . at sufficiently small scales ,",
    "microscopic processes homogenize the flow and dissipate the kinetic energy .",
    "thus , there is a deep connection between the turbulent cascade and sub - grid scale mixing .",
    "@xcite have demonstrated that the piece - wise parabolic method ( ppm , which we use ) , based on the euler equation ( which has no explicit viscosity ) , converges to the same limit as methods based on navier - stokes equation ( which do have explicit viscosity ) , as the grid is refined to smaller zones and smaller effective viscosity ( the relevant limit for astrophysics ) .",
    "the subgrid scale dissipation for monotonicity preserving hydrodynamic algorithms @xcite , which is implicit in these methods , automatically gives a reasonable treatment of the turbulent cascade down to the grid scale .",
    "we use this implicit sub - grid dissipation in our large eddy simulation ( iles ) ; this is the most computationally efficient way to deal with turbulent systems with a large range of scales .",
    "the largest scales , which set the rate of cascade and contain most of the energy are explicitly calculated , while the sub - grid scales are dissipated in a way consistent with the kolmogorov cascade .",
    "@xcite have presented a refinement of the ppm algorithm which has improved behavior at the smaller resolvable scales .",
    "we have not yet implemented this modification .",
    "the theoretical approach used here involves integrated properties of convective cells ; we find by direct resolution studies that these properties are well estimated even with surprisingly modest resolution , because they are determined primarily by the largest scales in the convective region .",
    "it appears that the iles simulations are adequate for the present analysis .",
    "@xcite have shown that the numerical damping at sub - grid scales in our iles simulations is quantitatively consistent with the introduction _ analytically _ of the kolmogorov cascade into the theoretical discussion .",
    "the turbulent velocity field was found to be dominated by two components :    1 .   a non - isotropic flow of the largest scale modes in the convection zone , which is coupled to the fluctuations .",
    "this has aspects of a `` coherent structure '' @xcite .",
    "the largest scales are unstable toward break - up , but are least affected by dissipation , and in this sense the most laminar .",
    "2 .   a more isotropic , homogeneous turbulent flow which carries the kinetic energy via the turbulent cascade to scales small enough for dissipation to occur @xcite . because of the vast size difference , the small scales are weakly coupled to the largest scales , which determine the rate at which energy flows through the cascade .",
    "if we approximate the non - isotropic component of the flow ( the largest scale of convection ) with that described by the lorenz model , this interpretation captures the oxygen - burning fluctuations .",
    "there are two limiting cases for convective flow , depending upon the convective mach number @xmath9 ( the ratio of the fluid speed to the local sound speed ) ; these are usually termed the  incompressible \" ( @xmath10 ) and  compressible \" ( @xmath11 ) regimes .",
    "stars are stratified in density , so that the notion of  incompressiblity \" is misleading .",
    "we will use the term  low - mach number flow \" in place of ",
    "incompressible \" when we mean flows in which acoustic radiation is small , but may be compressed due to stratification .    for turbulent motion , the pressure perturbation @xmath12 is related to the convective mach number by @xmath13 .",
    "sound waves outstrip fluid motion , so that pressure differences quickly become small , except possibly for a static background stratification .",
    "most of the historical research on convection ( e.g. , the bnard problem , @xcite ) is done in this limit .    using the reynolds decomposition , @xmath14 , with horizontal averaging @xmath15 and @xmath16 , mass conservation for a steady state flow",
    "can be written @xmath17    the navier - stokes equation , using mass conservation , is @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the reynolds stress tensor .",
    "mass conservation implies a convenient identity involving total co - moving derivatives , @xmath20 taking the dot product of the velocity vector @xmath21 with the navier - stokes equation , gives a kinetic energy equation , @xmath22 if on average the system is in a steady state , the time derivative must integrate to zero over the convective region , and the mass conservation law implies that the total buoyancy power term is zero , @xmath23 ( assuming constant @xmath24 on horizontal averaging ) , and therefore does not contribute to the production of kinetic energy anywhere in the flow .",
    "the only other term , which remains to balance the viscous dissipation of the kinetic energy , is the pressure term @xmath25 which may be rewritten as @xmath26 the divergence term vanishes upon integration over the volume . using hydrostatic equilibrium for the background state , @xmath27 , and mass conservation , @xmath28 @xmath29 when the mach number is small , the second term the right hand expression is nearly zero because @xmath30 and the turbulent pressure is negligible . in this limit the kinetic energy production is best understood as due to the remaining buoyancy power term @xmath31 , which is directly related to the enthalpy flux @xcite .    when the mach number is no longer small , the second term on the rhs of eq .",
    "[ pfluct ] increases in importance : both the divergence of the fluctuating velocity field and the pressure perturbation begin to play a role .",
    "the velocity field changes character ; it is no longer dominated by rotational flow , but develops an irrotational component ( @xmath32 . the flow becomes diverging ( consider the extreme limit of a point explosion which is pure divergence ) . also , the ram ",
    "pressure \" ( a tensor @xmath33 ) is not negligible and must be included in the momentum equation (  hydrostatic equilibrium \" ) .",
    "sound wave generation increases rapidly as @xmath34 ( @xcite ,  75 ) .",
    "the compressible limit is @xmath35 .",
    "shock formation is the most startling change in the flow character .    which of the @xmath9 limits is relevant for astrophysics ?",
    "almost all the matter in stellar convection zones , during almost all evolution , is in the limit of low - mach number flow , as are our turbulence simulations .",
    "the exceptions are important : ( 1 ) explosions , such as supernovae and novae , ( 2 ) vigorous thermonuclear flashes , ( 3 ) vigorous pulsations , especially radial ones , and ( 4 ) the sub - photospheric layers of stellar surface convection zones , which are strongly non - adiabatic , to name a few .",
    "and its rayleigh number @xmath36 . turbulent velocity squared ( solid ) and buoyancy power to the 2/3 power ( dotted ) are plotted versus time . the axes where chosen so that the same number of peaks would be shown , and the average kinetic energy be the same .",
    "the curves are surprisingly similar , even though ( 1 ) the lorenz model used only a single mode , ( 2 ) @xmath37 and @xmath36 were not adjusted to give a fit , ( 3 ) the lorenz model imposes thermal balance while thermal imbalance adds to the background slope in the simulation ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) , and ( 4 ) the simulations have @xmath38 more degrees of freedom than the lorenz model . ]    figure  [ fig1 ] illustrates the behavior of two important integral quantities , the total turbulent kinetic energy and the total buoyancy power , in the oxygen - burning shell simulations for a 23 @xmath39 star @xcite .",
    "the flow has a low - mach number ( @xmath40 ) , although the numerical simulations use the equations for fully compressible fluid flow , and would have correctly treated high - mach number flows .",
    "also shown are the same quantities for the lorenz model , which is discussed in section  [ lor ] .    at any instant in time ,",
    "the total convective kinetic energy is @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the mass of the convective zone and @xmath43 is the rms velocity is the solenoidal velocity in the convective region , with overall translational velocity removed , so that @xmath43 is its root - mean - square value .",
    "] , while the kinetic energy in the isotropic part of the turbulent flow field is @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the turbulent velocity , which we define as the isotropic part of the turbulent flow , where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the velocity components perpendicular to the direction of the gravity vector , i.e. , the tangential velocities .",
    "the vertical velocity also contains a significant contribution ( @xmath48 ) from the non - isotropic flow of the largest eddies .",
    "a more careful discussion of the velocities in terms of principal orthogonal decomposition is in preparation . ] .",
    "the reader is warned that division of the flow into `` turbulent '' and  large scale \" flow is useful but an oversimplification , so that the exact relative values of these two kinetic energies depend upon the algorithm used in their definition , but is of order unity @xcite .",
    "consequently the precise distinction does not change the qualitative picture .",
    "the buoyancy power is the rate at which kinetic energy per unit mass is increased by buoyant acceleration .",
    "if it is integrated over the space containing the convection zone , we have @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the buoyant acceleration times the turbulent velocity ; @xmath51 has units of velocity cubed .    in figure  [ fig1 ]",
    "the simulations show a phase lag of about 20 seconds between the peaks in buoyancy term ( @xmath52 ) and turbulent kinetic energy .",
    "this is about half the time it takes the flow to transit a distance @xmath5 , the depth of the convection zone .",
    "it also corresponds to an e - folding time for turbulent kinetic energy decay due to kolmogorov damping , where @xmath53 .",
    "power spectra for both variables peak at 89 seconds ; an average transit time is @xmath54 .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows multimodal behavior in the 3d simulations ; preliminary results from a quantitative analysis @xcite using principal orthogonal decomposition ( pod ) indicates that a single dominant mode has about 43% of the kinetic energy , the first five modes have 75% , and 90% is reached with the eleventh mode . there is a strong dominant mode but also significant energy in several other modes",
    "; the modes interact in a nonlinear and dynamic way .",
    "the buoyancy power is a large scale feature and is strongly anisotropic ( plumes move vertically ) .",
    "the dissipation implied by the turbulence occurs at the kolmogorov scale ( which is tiny ) ; this dissipation is wide - spread in space @xcite , including the entire turbulent region on average , and bounded by the stably stratified layers . because buoyancy and dissipation occur at vastly different length scales , they are weakly coupled .    in low mach number flow , on average over time ,",
    "the buoyant driving must balance the turbulent damping for a quasi - steady state to exist ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion , especially their eq .",
    "the time averaged viscous dissipation is @xmath55 where @xmath3 is the dissipation length , @xmath5 is the depth of the convection zone , and the over - lines indicate an average over time ( two turnover times or four transit times , about 200 seconds , in the analysis ) .    from equation  [ eturb ]",
    "it is clear that the turbulent dissipation is of third order in the turbulent velocity , while the buoyancy power , @xmath50 , is second order ( because @xmath56 is first order ) .",
    "this means that in the turbulent regime there is a unique turbulent velocity which satisfies the condition that buoyancy power balance turbulent damping .",
    "this has the nature of an eigenvalue problem .",
    "the assumption of a turbulent cascade implies finite turbulent velocities , with macroscopic structure .",
    "equation  [ eturb ] applies as an integral over a region much larger than the kolmogorov scale ; at the kolmogorov scale microscopic dissipation occurs by the navier - stokes term ( @xcite ,  15 ) .",
    "if we dot this navier - stokes term with the velocity to generate a rate of kinetic energy destruction by viscosity ( see equation  [ ke - eq ] ) , we have @xmath57 which does scale as the velocity to second order . when integrated over the turbulent cascade , equation  [ enavier ] becomes equation  [ eturb ] .",
    "the extra factor of velocity comes from the rate at which turbulent kinetic energy is delivered to the kolmogorov scale .",
    "turbulence is an inherently nonlinear process , which sets up its own scales and structures .",
    "care must be taken in analyzing it with techniques involving expansion in series .",
    "the dissipation is seen to be driven by the isotropic part of the flow @xmath45 , which accounts for about three - fourths of the kinetic energy according to estimates by @xcite ( which are roughly similar to those from pod analysis by @xcite ) .",
    "note that @xmath58 which gives the vertical offset between the solid and dotted curves in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "consider the average conditions from 200 to 800 seconds in the simulations .",
    "the average level of buoyancy ( actually @xmath52 is plotted ) is higher than that of kinetic energy in isotropic turbulence . if we equate ( 1 ) the power generated by buoyancy , to ( 2 ) the dissipation due to turbulence , both averaged over a few transit times , we find @xmath59 thus , in the @xcite simulations , _ the dissipation length is found to be essentially the depth of the convective zone _ , consistent with kolmogorov theory .",
    "these results are far more general than the particular stellar situation we have discussed . while the neutrino cooling may seem exotic to some stellar evolutionists , in fact it behaves somewhat like the more familiar cooling by radiative diffusion , and has no strange effect on the turbulence .",
    "we note that the original simulations @xcite , which included core hydrogen burning cooled by radiative diffusion as well as oxygen shell burning cooled by neutrinos , explicitly showed this similarity .    in the long term",
    ", the thermal state of the convection zone is supposed to evolve toward a global thermal balance between total heating by nuclear burning and total cooling by neutrino emission @xcite .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig2 ] , which shows time average luminosities of heating and of cooling , as a function of the entropy of the convection zone . at lower entropy , as in the 3d simulation",
    ", the heating is dominant , causing the entropy to increase .",
    "this is accomplished primarily by expansion , with a small increase in temperature .",
    "the decrease in density causes a bigger change in nuclear burning than in neutrino cooling , so that a thermal balance would be attained ( shown as a vertical line ) when the heating and cooling curves cross .",
    "the gradual rise in turbulent kinetic energy in the simulation , shown in figure  [ fig1 ] , occurs in a shell which is below the entropy of balanced heating and cooling , so that heating dominates .",
    "the pulses are much faster than this secular evolution , which changes on a time scale of @xmath60  seconds .",
    "the lorenz model is a convective roll , or cell , whose dynamics are described by three amplitude equations .",
    "this is a simple example of an elegant method of reduction of turbulent flow to a low - order set of dynamical equations using amplitudes of a proper orthogonal decomposition ( pod ) of numerical simulations or extensive experimental data sets @xcite .",
    "the lorenz model is a better mathematical representation of the dynamics of a convective cell than mlt in that the acceleration and deceleration over a convective cycle are integrated to determine the motion , rather than prescribed .",
    "because it uses a single mode , the lorenz model does not have sensitivity to local variation ; it is a _",
    "global _ model , unlike mlt , which is local .",

    "the form for dissipation that lorenz used is not the same as implied by kolmogorov , so that the threshold for instability changes @xcite .",
    "we may interpret the prandtl number @xmath37 and the rayleigh number @xmath36 in terms of a renormalization in which the existence of turbulence implies effective prandtl and rayleigh numbers for the convective cell .",
    "the actual values of the microscopic viscosity and thermal conductivity have little feedback on the behavior of the largest eddies ; see section  [ iles ] .",
    "magnetic fields in real stars may affect the effective prandtl number further , which in the classical lorenz model affects in turn the development of instability in the convective roll .    for problems which are insensitive to the details of the small scale flow , the values of the microscopic prandtl do not matter ; the turbulent system bootstraps to an effective dissipation for which the rules of kolmogorov hold .",
    "this approximation applies to hydrostatic ( and mildly dynamic ) stellar evolution , in which the burning times are long compared to sound travel times . for these problems ,",
    "iles is appropriate .",
    "there are notable exceptions , such as a flame front in a medium of unmixed fuel and ash ( snia progenitor models ) , for which the small scales are important , and direct numerical simulations ( dns ) of the small scales is necessary .",
    "finally , we recall how the lorenz model was constructed : a low order mode was chosen , a rayleigh number was chosen just above the onset of instability for that mode , and a prandtl number was chosen which gave interesting behavior .",
    "while different parameter choices are mathematically interesting @xcite , their physical relevance must be re - evaluated .",
    "the lorenz equations are a spartan subset of the fluid equations which contain the germ of chaos ; it is probably better to use them as a guide rather than a gospel ."
