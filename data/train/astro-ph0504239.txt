    "despite their humble appearances , the dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) satellites of the milky way provide a source of persistent intrigue .",
    "mysteries concerning their origin , evolution , mass density , and dynamical state make it difficult to know where to place these common galaxies in the context of standard ( e.g. cold dark matter ) models of structure formation .",
    "are they primordial building blocks of bigger galaxies , or debris from galaxy interactions ?",
    "while dsph galaxies have stellar populations similar in number to those of globular clusters ( @xmath2 ) , their stars are spread over a much larger volume ( @xmath3-@xmath4 kpc compared to @xmath5-@xmath6 pc in globular clusters ) resulting in the lowest luminosity ( i.e. , baryonic ) densities known in any type of galaxy . in many cases",
    "it is unclear how these galaxies could have avoided tidal disruption by the milky way over their lifetimes without the addition of considerable unseen mass .",
    "this characteristic of dsph galaxies suggests that the dynamics of these systems are dominated either by significant amounts of unseen matter , or that these galaxies are all far from dynamical equilibrium .",
    "in general , the jeans equations ( equations ( 4 - 21 ) , ( 4 - 24 ) , and ( 4 - 27 ) of binney & tremaine 1987 @xcite , hereafter , bt87 ) provide a robust description of the mass distribution , @xmath0 , of a collisionless gravitational system  such as a dsph galaxy  in viral equilibrium , equation ( [ eq : em ] ) below .",
    "their general form permits any number of mass components ( stellar , gas , dark ) , as well as anisotropy in the velocity dispersion tensor and a non - spherical gravitational potential .",
    "when applied to spherical stellar systems and assuming at most only radial or tangential velocity anisotropy , these equations can be simplified to estimate the radial mass distribution ( equation 4 - 55 of bt87 ) : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the spatial density distribution of stars , @xmath9 is the mean squared stellar radial velocity at radius @xmath1 .",
    "the dimensionless isotropy parameter , @xmath10 , compares the system s radial and tangential velocity components : @xmath11 apart from the constraints on the geometry and the functional form of the anisotropy , equation ( [ eq : mrjeans ] ) is model - independent , making it an appealing tool .",
    "it is relevant that equation ( [ eq : mrjeans ] ) and ( [ eq : jns1 ] ) below are applicable to any tracer population that in equilibrium and satisfies the collisionless boltzman equation .",
    "kinematic datasets for individual dsph galaxies have historically been far too small ( typically containing radial velocities for @xmath12 30 stars ; see mateo 1998 ) to allow for a precise determination of @xmath0 using relations similar to equation ( [ eq : mrjeans ] ) .",
    "instead , authors have been forced to adopt additional strong assumptions that reduce the jeans equation to even simpler forms and where the relevant distributions ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 in equation [ eq : mrjeans ] ) are represented by parametric models .",
    "specifically , if one assumes isotropy of the velocity dispersion tensor ( i.e. , @xmath15 ) , spherical symmetry , and that the starlight traces the mass distribution ( effectively a single - component king model ( irwin and hatzidimitriou 1995 ) ) , then one obtains for the m / l ratio ( richstone and tremaine 1986 ) : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the one - dimensional central velocity dispersion , @xmath18 is the central surface brightness , and @xmath19 is the half - light radius .",
    "the parameter @xmath20 is nearly equal to unity for a wide range of realistic spherical dynamical models so long as the mass distribution is assumed to match that of the visible matter . with this approach ",
    "the modern variant of the classical ` king fitting ' procedure ( king 1966 )  the measured central radial velocity dispersion and surface brightness yield estimates of such quantities as the global and central m / l ratios .",
    "in all eight of the mw s measured dsphs , large central velocity dispersions have conspired with their low surface brightnesses to produce large inferred m / l values .",
    "this line of reasoning has led to a general belief that dsph galaxies are almost completely dark - matter dominated , and their halos have assumed the role of the smallest non - baryonic mass concentrations identified so far in the present - day universe .",
    "this analysis fails for galaxies that are far from dynamical equilibrium , for example due to the effects of external tidal forces from the milky way ( fleck and kuhn 2003 ; klessen and kroupa , 1998 ) .",
    "numerical models aimed to investigate this ( oh et al .",
    "1995 ; piatek and pryor 1995 ) generally found that tides have negligible effects on the central dynamics of dsph galaxies until the survival time of the galaxy as a bound system becomes comparable to the orbital time ( about 1 gyr for the closer dsph satellites of the milky way ) .",
    "observations agree with this broad conclusion by finding that remote dsph galaxies are no less likely to contain significant dark matter halos than systems located closer to their parent galaxy ( mateo et al .",
    "1998 ; vogt et al . 1995 ) .",
    "however , so - called resonance models ( fleck and kuhn 2003 ; kuhn 1993 ; kuhn et al .",
    "1996 ) have been proposed that imply the central velocity dispersions can be significantly altered due to the inclusion of stars streaming outward from the barycenter of a galaxy and projected near the galaxy core .",
    "recent versions of these models invariably imply a significant extension of the affected galaxies along the line - of - sight ( more precisely , along the line between the center of the dwarf and the milky way ; kroupa 1997 ; klessen and kroupa 1998 ) and a massive tidal stream along the satellite s orbit .",
    "observations do not reveal strong evidence of significant line - of - sight distortions in dsph galaxies ( hurley - keller et al 1999 ; klessen et al .",
    "2003 ) , other than sagittarius ( e.g. ibata et al .",
    "1995 ) ; thus , for the purposes of this paper , we will assume that dsph galaxies are generally close to a state of dynamical equilibrium .",
    "even with this enabling assumption , the classical analysis of dsph masses as we describe it above is far from ideal for a number of reasons .",
    "first , though recent work ( e.g. irwin and hatzidimitriou 1995 ) has helped to greatly improve estimates of dsph structural parameters ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 in equation [ eq : moverl ] ) , the errors in the velocity dispersions  often dominated by poisson uncertainties due to the small number of kinematic tracers ",
    "contribute the principle source of uncertainty in m / l estimates .",
    "second , there is little reason to suppose the assumption that mass follows light in dsphs is valid . in all other galaxies",
    "the bulk of the matter resides in a dark halo extending far beyond the luminous matter , a trend that becomes more exaggerated toward smaller scales ( kormendy and freeman 2004 ) . finally ,",
    "velocity anisotropies , if they exist , may mimic the presence of dark matter , and so represent a tricky degeneracy in the model even if the assumption of isotropy is dropped .",
    "modern instrumentation is poised to deliver dramatically larger kinematic datasets to help minimize the first problem .",
    "for example , the michigan / magellan fiber system , now operational at the magellan 6.5-m telescopes , obtains spectra from which high - precision radial velocities can be measured of up to 256 objects simultaneously . as a result , it is now feasible to obtain thousands of individual stellar spectra in many dsph systems , enlarging sample sizes by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "this not only reduces the statistical uncertainty of the dispersion estimation , but can also provide information on the spatial variation of the dispersion across the face of a galaxy .",
    "these rich datasets therefore allow for fundamentally improved results even using fairly conventional analysis techniques .",
    "for example , by parameterizing the velocity anisotropy , wilkinson et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and kleyna et al .",
    "( 2002 ) show that samples of @xmath23 stars can begin to break the degeneracy between anisotropy and mass in spherical systems .",
    "but these large datasets also allow us to aim higher . in this paper",
    ", we introduce and develop the formalism for a qualitatively different sort of analysis designed to make the most efficient use of large kinematic datasets . rather than adopting a model that parameterizes the various distributions used in the jeans equation ( e.g. , @xmath0 , @xmath13 , @xmath24 , or @xmath10 )",
    ", we operate on the star count and radial velocity data directly to estimate the mass distribution non - parametrically .",
    "we estimate the true three - dimensional mass distribution from the projected stellar distribution and the line - of - sight velocity distribution . in this first application of our technique",
    ", we still require the assumptions of viral equilibrium , spherical symmetry , and velocity isotropy ( @xmath15 ) . in section 2 , we introduce notation and definitions of the three - dimensional as well as projected stellar and phase - space densities and review the jeans equation . in sections 3 and 4 ,",
    "we show how to use very general shape constraints on the mass distribution to estimate the detailed form of the velocity dispersion profile and the radial mass distribution .",
    "we illustrate the process on simulated data , demonstrating that , when furnished with large datasets , nonparametric analysis is a powerful and robust tool for estimating mass distributions in spherical or near - spherical systems ( section 5 ) .",
    "we illustrate the application of our approach to an existing  but relatively small  kinematic dataset for the fornax dsph galaxy at the end of section 5 .",
    "our emphasis in this paper is the application of our technique to dsph kinematics , but the method described in this paper is applicable to any dynamically hot system in which the radial velocity field is sampled discretely at the positions of a tracer population .",
    "thus , our methodology would work for , say , samples of globular clusters or planetary nebulae surrounding large elliptical galaxies , or for individual stars within a globular cluster .",
    "our approach follows earlier non - parametric analysis of globular cluster kinematics by gebhardt and fischer ( 1995 ) and merritt et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , though the details of our method differ significantly .",
    "let @xmath25 and @xmath26 denote the 3-dimensional position and velocity of a star within a galaxy .",
    "we will regard these as jointly distributed random vectors , as in bt87 , p. 194 .",
    "suppose that @xmath27 and @xmath28 have a joint density that is spherically symmetric and isotropic , so that @xmath29 = f_0(r , v)d{{\\mbox{\\boldmath$x$}}}d{{\\mbox{\\boldmath$v$}}},\\ ] ] where @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "we also suppose that @xmath32 has been centered to have a mean of zero so that @xmath33 suppose finally that the mass density @xmath34 is spherically symmetric and let @xmath35 the total mass within @xmath1 of the center .",

    ", @xmath40 is the one - dimensional radial - velocity dispersion profile squared , and @xmath45 is the true , three - dimensional density profile of the tracer population . using the notation of bt87 , these correspond to @xmath24 and @xmath13 , respectively .    to estimate @xmath0 from equation ( [ eq : jns1 ] ) clearly requires estimates of the functions @xmath46 and @xmath47 . for dsph galaxies , the data available for this consist of a large sample of positions and photometry of stars in individual systems ( irwin and hatzidimitriou 1995 ; hereafter ih95 ) , and much smaller samples of stars with positions and velocities ( e.g. walker et al .",
    "2004 ) . of course , it is not possible yet to determine complete three - dimensional positional or velocity information for any of these stars , but only the velocity in the line of sight and the projection of position on the plane orthogonal to the line of sight . with a proper choice of coordinates ,",
    "these observables become @xmath48 , and @xmath49 .",
    "these can be made equivalent to , say , right ascension and declination , and radial velocity , respectively .",
    "the incomplete observation of @xmath32 does not cause a problem here , given the assumed isotropy , since @xmath50 can be replaced by @xmath51 in equation ( [ eq : mu ] ) without changing the value of @xmath40 .",
    "the incomplete observation of position poses a more serious problem that is known as wicksell s ( 1925 ) problem in the statistical literature .",

    "silverman ( 1986 ) is a recommended source for background information on kernel density estimation .",
    "possible choices of @xmath150 and the computation of @xmath61 are discussed there .",
    "other methods for estimating @xmath148 include local polynomials [ 79 - 82 , loader 1999 ] and log - splines [ 178 - 179 , gu 2002 ] .",
    "whichever method is adopted , once @xmath151 has been estimated , @xmath152 may be subsequently estimated by @xmath153 then @xmath112 can be estimated by replacing @xmath152 with @xmath154 in ( [ eq : psisharp ] ) . in this case @xmath155 is no longer exactly unbiased , but it is at least consistent in the statistical sense that as the number of data points increases , the estimator continuously tends ever closer to the true value .",
    "generally , @xmath156 does not satisfy the shape restrictions when viewed as a function of @xmath145 : @xmath156 is unbounded as @xmath145 approaches any of the data points @xmath126 .",

    "may be called the _ naive _ estimator .",
    "this naive estimator can be improved by imposing physically justified shape restrictions on @xmath0 .",

    "deciding exactly where reliability ends is difficult , but the confidence bands of figures [ fig : masscb ] and [ fig : diffsample ] provide some indication . in the example of figure 6 , they correctly predict that reliability deteriorates abruptly for @xmath234 and , interestingly , make the same prediction for a range of sample sizes .",
    "there are several sources of error in our derived velocity dispersion and mass profile estimators which may be divided into the broad classes of modeling error , systematic error , and statistical error .",
    "while quite general , our assumptions also represent some over - simplification and these too introduce uncertainty to our results .",
    "the assumption of spherical symmetry , for example , ignores the known ellipticities seen in most dsph galaxies ( ih95 , mateo 1998 ) . but even if we assume our working assumptions were all correct , systematic error will develop from our approximations of distributions as step functions , piecewise linear functions , and quadratic splines . on general grounds , this error will be small provided that the underlying true functions are smooth , so we feel justified in ignoring this source of systematic error .",
    "we have also ignored the statistical error in the estimation of @xmath46 in section [ sect : h ] , because the sample sizes in ih95 are so large .",
    "that leaves the statistical error in the kinematic data as the principle source of uncertainty in our estimation of @xmath112 and the estimators of @xmath47 and @xmath94 .    to quantify the magnitude of this error ,",
    "let @xmath235 denote the error committed when estimating @xmath0 , and let @xmath236 denote the @xmath237 percentile of its distribution distribution , so that @xmath238 = \\alpha$ ] .",
    "then @xmath239 = 1 - 2\\alpha,\\ ] ] and @xmath240 $ ] is a @xmath241 percent confidence interval for @xmath0 . within the context of plummer s model",
    ", the @xmath236 can be obtained from a monte carlo simulation .",
    "if we generate @xmath242 samples from plummer s model , we obtain @xmath242 values for the errors @xmath243 , which we denote as @xmath244",
    ". then @xmath236 may be estimated by the value of @xmath145 for which the @xmath245 of the @xmath246 are less than or equal to @xmath145 .",
    "we applied this procedure to a grid of @xmath1 values with @xmath247 and @xmath248 and then connected the resulting bounds to in a continuous piecewise linear fashion to obtain the 95%  and 68%  confidence bounds shown in figure [ fig : masscb ] .",
    "the 95%  and 68%  confidence bounds for @xmath47 shown in figure [ fig : mucb ] were obtained in a similar manner .",
    "the procedure just outlined requires knowing the true @xmath0 and the distributions of @xmath134 and @xmath49 from the plummer model .",
    "but the exercise is still useful since it shows the intrinsic accuracy of the estimation procedure .",
    "for example , when the sample size is @xmath249 , the estimator of @xmath0 has very little accuracy for @xmath250 .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , the estimator for @xmath0 retains reasonable accuracy for @xmath251 despite the lack of much data beyond @xmath252 ( see figure [ fig : counts ] ) .",
    "we have also explored how our estimates fare with significantly smaller samples of tracers with known positions and velocities ( i.e. , fewer @xmath224 pairs ) .",
    "figure [ fig : diffsample ] shows @xmath253 percent confidence bounds for the estimates of @xmath0 and @xmath40 based on sample sizes @xmath254 , @xmath255 , @xmath256 and @xmath257 stars . as one might expect , the confidence bounds expand as the sample size decreases , but , interestingly , the radial location of where the estimator performs poorly only very slowly migrates to smaller values of @xmath1 as the sample shrinks .",
    "the requirement that we know @xmath0 and the distribution of @xmath134 and @xmath49 ahead of time in order to estimate the confidence bounds can be avoided by using a bootstrap procedure . in its simplest form , the bootstrap can be implemented as follows : given a sample of @xmath258 values ( corresponding to the observable projected position and radial velocity for each star in a kinematic sample ) , first compute @xmath230 .",
    "then generate @xmath259 samples with replacement objects , one selects a new sample of @xmath186 values from the original values @xmath260 .",
    "the new sample differs from the original in that each value @xmath260 is returned to the sample before choosing the next value @xmath261 . in this way",
    ", some values from the original sample will invariably be chosen more than once to form the bootstrap sample . ] from the given sample and compute estimators @xmath262 for each of these samples .",
    "let @xmath263 and estimate the percentiles of @xmath264 as described above . letting @xmath265 denote the estimated @xmath237 percentile , @xmath266 $ ] is the bootstrap confidence interval for @xmath0 . for more details ,",
    "see efrom and tibshirani ( 1993 ) who provide a good introduction to bootstrap methods .",
    "this approach offers a practical way of assessing the statistical errors in @xmath229 and @xmath230 of an actual kinematic sample .",
    "there is also the possibility of obtaining large - sample approximations to the error distribution . from ( [ eq : zi ] )",
    ", it is clear that the @xmath211 are approximately normally distributed in large samples .",
    "this suggests that the distribution of @xmath267 should be approximately the same as the distribution of a shape - restricted estimator in a normal model .",
    "unfortunately , calculating the latter is complicated .",
    "some qualitative features are notable , however .",
    "monotone regression estimators are generally quite reliable away from the end points , but subject to the _ spiking problem _ near the end points . for non - decreasing regression ,",
    "the estimator has a positive bias near large values of the independent variable ( in this case , @xmath1 ) , and a negative bias at small values of the independent variable ( i.e. for @xmath268 ) .",
    "the positive bias at large @xmath1 is very clearly seen in figure [ fig : masscb ] and is exacerbated by the sparsity of data .",
    "the negative bias near @xmath114 is not evident because it is ameliorated by two effects .",
    "first , the mass distribution is known to be always positive ( @xmath269 ) and goes to zero at @xmath114 ( @xmath270 ) .",
    "this eliminates bias at @xmath114 .",
    "second , our assumption ( [ eq : spln3 ] ) requires @xmath230 to be of order @xmath271 for small @xmath1 , while @xmath0 is  on physical grounds  known to approach zero as @xmath272 for small @xmath1 .      as an application to real observational data , we have use the radial velocity data from walker et al ( 2005 ) for the fornax dsph galaxy .",
    "this dataset consists of velocities for 181 stars observed one at a time over the past 12 years ( mateo et al .",
    "1991 has a description of some of the earliest data used here ) .",
    "data from newer multi - object instruments are not included here ( see walker et al 2005b for a first analysis of these newer results ) .",
    "full details about the observations can be found in the papers referenced above ; for the present application we simply adopt these results along with their quoted errors to see what sort of estimator for @xmath0 we can extract from these data . from the simulations we already know that the dataset is relatively small for this method , but these simulations also imply that we have no reason to expect a strong bias in our mass estimator due to the sample size , only a potentially large uncertainty ( at least a factor of 2 ) in the final mass estimate .",
    "the histogram of the star counts from ( irwin and hatzidimitriou 1995 ) is shown in the first panel of figure [ fig : fornax1 ] .",
    "the remaining two panels in figure [ fig : fornax1 ] show the derived estimates for the spatial density of stars in fornax @xmath273 and the true projected radial distribution of stars in fornax @xmath274 .",
    "the bottom panels of figure [ fig : fornax21 ] give the estimated projected radial distribution of stars from ( walker et al , 2004 ) and the estimated selection function @xmath275 derived from the data . figure [ fig : fornax22 ] show the mass profile , @xmath230 and the squared velocity dispersion profile , @xmath229 .",
    "previous estimates of the fornax mass have been based primarily on the classical , or king ( 1966 ) analysis outlined in the introduction of this paper , and give @xmath276 range from @xmath4 to @xmath277 m@xmath278 ( mateo et al .",
    "1991 ; walker et al .",
    "these models resemble truncated isothermal spheres and implicitly assume spherical symmetry , velocity isotropy , that mass follows light , and a specific parametric form for the joint density function @xmath36 .",
    "our mass distribution estimator provides an independent measurement employing neither of the latter two assumptions .",
    "if one believes the second plateau seen at @xmath279 kpc in figure [ fig : fornax22 ] ( first panel ) is a real feature , this would indicate a fornax mass of @xmath280 .",
    "however , we note that the simulations using plummer models ( figure [ fig : diffsample ] ) show similar plateaux at large radii related not to the underlying mass , but rather to the scarcity of remaining data points . the first plateau ( @xmath281 kpc ) , by contrast , covers a region for which the plummer simulations indicate even a relatively small dataset can yield a reasonable estimate of the mass .",
    "we therefore consider the two plateaux in the @xmath0 curve of figure [ fig : fornax22 ] to bracket the region of plausible fornax mass as measured from an n @xmath12 200 sample by the estimation technique .",
    "the resulting interval of @xmath282m@xmath278 @xmath283m@xmath284 @xmath285 @xmath286 m@xmath278 is of considerably larger mass than the results of the classical analysis .",
    "the estimation approach then offers an attractive alternative to variants of the classical analysis that require parametric dynamical models to interpret kinematic data for dsphs .",
    "our simulations show that this new non - parametric analysis will provide significantly more accurate results as kinematic samples grow larger .",
    "finally , we can make some comments regarding the effect of velocity anisotropy in our results .",
    "if we consider an extreme case where the outermost bins of the fornax velocity dispersion profile are dominated by stars in tangential orbits ( that is , @xmath287 ; see equations ( [ eq : mrjeans ] ) and ( [ eq : jbeta ] ) ) , then the outer bins give us the mass directly ( from equation [ eq : mrjeans ] ) as @xmath288 , or @xmath289 m@xmath278 , which is equivalent to the lower limit provided by the mass estimation technique .",
    "thus , even if we consider an extreme breakdown of the isotropy assumption , the data alone support a larger mass than the simple king analysis . since it is more likely that the velocity distribution has intermediate anisotropy ( kleyna et al .",
    "2002 ) , we conclude that the the mass of fornax to the outermost measured data point is between @xmath290 and @xmath286 m@xmath291 for an observed luminosity of @xmath292 l@xmath278 for fornax , this gives a global m / l ratio ranging from 7 to 22 .",
    "thus , even the most luminous , most baryonic - dominated dsph satellite of the milky way is dominated by dark matter .",
    "we have presented a new method for estimating the distribution of mass in a spherical galaxy . along the way , we have made some choices , generally preferring the simplest of several alternatives  for example , the use of quadratic splines in section 4 and simple histograms in section 3 . in spite of this , the algorithm is a bit complicated .",
    "is it really better than simpler methods  for example , using kernel smoothing to estimate the distribution of projected radii and line of sight velocities and then using inversion to estimate @xmath0 ?",
    "our method differs from the simpler approach through its essential use of shape restrictions . from a purely statistical viewpoint ,",
    "the monotonicity of @xmath113 in equation ( [ eq : jns2 ] ) provides a lot of useful information [ robertson , et.al .",
    "( 1988 ) ] .",
    "early in our investigations , we tried the kernel smoothing outlined above and found that the resulting estimators did not satisfy the shape restriction , leading to negative estimates of the mass density .",
    "imposing the shape restrictions directly guarantees non - negative estimates , at least .",
    "it also reduces the importance of tuning parameters , like the bandwidth in kernel estimation or the number of bins in our work . imposing the shape restrictions also complicates the algorithm and leaves a quadratic programming problem at the end .",
    "we think that the game is worth the candle .",
    "there is some similarity between our method and that of merritt and saha ( 1993 ) in that both use basis functions , splines in our case , and both impose shape restrictions , the condition that @xmath293 in theirs .",
    "our method makes more esssential use of shape restrictions and treats the inversion problem in greater detail ."
