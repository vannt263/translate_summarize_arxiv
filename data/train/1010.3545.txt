    "the discovery of iron - based layered pnictide and chalcogenide superconductors@xcite with superconducting ( sc ) transition temperature as high as 55k ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) has generated enormous interest in the physics of these materials .",
    "similar to the cuprates , the iron - based superconductors are highly two - dimensional and superconductivity occurs in close proximity to anti - ferromagnetic order,@xcite leading several groups to propose that the pairing is driven by anti - ferromagnetic spin fluctuations.@xcite-@xcite    the first step in identifying the pairing mechanism is to investigate the structure of the sc - gap function , which describes the strength and quantum mechanical phase of electron pairs in momentum ( @xmath0 ) space . while the sc gap function of conventional phonon - mediated superconductors has the same phase throughout momentum space ( s - wave symmetry ) , that of spin - fluctuation mediated superconductors is expected to exhibit a sign reversal between those fermi momenta connected by characteristic wave vector @xmath1 of the spin fluctuations.@xcite in @xmath2 wave superconductors , the nodal planes of the order parameter intersect with the fermi surface , leading to gapless quasiparticle ( qp ) excitations that can be detected thermodynamically and by low energy probes . however ,",
    "if the sign reversal occurs between disconnected hole and electron pockets ( compare fig .  [ fig_fs ] ) resulting in an `` @xmath3 symmetry,''@xcite the relative sign of sc gap must be determined by phase - sensitive experiments such as josephson junctions experiments@xcite or composite sc loops.@xcite an alternative technique is scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) which determines the dispersion of quasiparticle states from the quasiparticle interference ( qpi ) patterns induced by impurity scattering@xcite-@xcite .",
    "such experiments , performed in an external magnetic field , offer the capability of probing the phase of the superconducting order parameter by detecting a field enhancement of the sign - preserving scattering that results from the sensitivity of qpi to the coherence factors associated with impurity scattering .",
    "the recent detection of a field enhancement of quasiparticle scattering between the hole pockets of the iron chalcogenide superconductor fe(se , te ) has been interpreted@xcite as evidence for the @xmath3 pairing scenario .",
    "however , there are certain differences between the field effect in iron - based and cuprate superconductors that raise questions about this interpretation . for example , fe(se , te ) is a pauli - limited superconductor where the coupling of the field to the conduction electrons becomes important . in this material ,",
    "the zeeman splitting is a large fraction of the superconducting gap size , @xmath4 , generating new components to the field - induced scattering that have been hitherto neglected in models of quasiparticle interference .    in the cuprates , quasiparticle scattering in external magnetic fields",
    "is strongly affected by vortices . however ,",
    "stm measurements on fe(se , te ) did not observe appreciable correlation in space between the location of vortices and the magnitude of field - induced change in the qpi intensity.@xcite these results suggest that in pauli - limited superconductors the role of vortices is much less important compared to homogeneously distributed field - induced scatterers created by zeeman splitting .",
    "one of the key arguments advanced in the stm measurements of fe(se , te ) , is that an applied magnetic field will , in general , enhance the time - reverse odd components of the scattering that lead to sign - preserving scattering .",
    "how effective are these arguments in the presence of significant pauli limiting effects , and to what extent can we attribute the observed field enhancement of the sign - preserving scattering to the zeeman splitting ?    motivated by the above considerations , this paper develops a phenomenological model for the field - dependent qpi in iron - based superconductors , taking into account the zeeman splitting of the quasiparticle dispersion .",
    "using a simple two - band bcs model for an unconventional @xmath5-wave superconductor , we calculate the stm conductance ratio for different types of disorder in an external magnetic field at which we neglect the scattering off vortices . in our model",
    ", we assume an @xmath3-wave symmetry for the superconducting order parameter which means that the size of the superconducting gap is isotropic along the hole and electron pockets .",
    "our study confirms that zeeman splitting provides a strong source of time - reversal - odd , sign - preserving scattering .",
    "we also find that if resonant or magnetic scatterers are present in the superconducting material , the spin split spectrum leads to an enhancement of sign preserving scattering .",
    "qpi patterns for non - magnetic and magnetic impurities without zeeman field have been computed theoretically by a number of works using more realistic band structures.@xcite-@xcite    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii  a , we briefly resume the basic concepts behind some types of scatterers with different time reversal symmetry properties and their coherence factors . the bcs model for an iron - based superconductor",

    "an stm measurement probes quasiparticle interference ( qpi ) by observing friedel oscillations in the tunneling density of states induced by impurity scattering .",
    "the fourier transform of these fluctuations in the density of states provides information about the rate at which quasiparticles are scattered by impurities . in general , the rate of impurity scattering is proportional to the coherence factors associated with the underlying scattering mechanism . by measuring the momentum dependence of the scattering , it becomes possible to extract phase sensitive information about the underlying order parameter .",

    "coherence factors describe the difference between the scattering rates of a sc quasiparticle and a bare electron off a given scatterer.@xcite in general , the scattering rate of an electron from initial momentum @xmath0 to final momentum @xmath6 is determined by an energy - dependent @xmath7-matrix @xmath8 .",

    "<S> we develop a model for the effect of a magnetic field on quasiparticle interference in an iron - based superconductor . </S>",
    "<S> recently , scanning tunneling experiments have been performed on fe(se , te ) to determine the relative sign of the superconducting gap from the magnetic - field dependence of quasiparticle scattering amplitudes . using a simple two - band bcs model , we study three different cases of scattering in a spin - split spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the dominant effect of a magnetic field in iron - based superconductors is caused by the pauli limiting of conduction electrons . </S>",
    "<S> thereby time reversal odd scattering is induced which enhances the sign - preserving and depresses the sign - reversing peaks in the quasiparticle interference patterns . </S>"
