    "algebraic multigrid ( amg ) attempts to mimic the main components of geometric multigrid in an algebraic fashion , that is , by using information from the coefficient matrix only to construct the multilevel solver .",
    "the basic algorithm uses a setup phase to construct a nested sequence of coarse spaces that are then used in the solve phase to compute the solution .",
    "the two main approaches to the amg setup algorithm are classical amg  @xcite and ( smoothed ) aggregation amg  @xcite , which are distinguished by the type of coarse variables used in the construction of amg interpolation .    in the classical amg algorithm ,",
    "the coarse variables are chosen using a coloring algorithm which is designed to find a suitable maximal independent subset of the fine variables . then , given the coarse degrees of freedom , a row of interpolation is constructed for each fine point from its neighboring coarse points .",
    "in contrast , the aggregation - based amg setup algorithm partitions the fine variables into disjoint subdomains , called aggregates . then , a column ( or several columns as in  @xcite ) of interpolation is associated to each aggregate , which has nonzero entries only for the unknowns belonging to this aggregate . the focus of this paper is on the development and , in particular , the analysis of the latter aggregation - type methods .    the idea of aggregating unknowns to coarsen a system of discretized partial differential equations dates back to work by leontev in 1959  @xcite . simon and",
    "ando developed a related technique for aggregating dynamic systems in 1961 @xcite and a two - grid aggregation - based scheme was considered in the context of solving markov chain systems by takahashi in 1975  @xcite .",
    "aggregation - based methods have been studied extensively since and numerous algorithms and theoretical results have followed  @xcite .",
    "vank introduced an extension of these methods known as smoothed aggregation multigrid in which smoothing steps are applied to the columns of the aggregation - based interpolation operator to accelerate two - level convergence and a modification of this two - level algorithm with overcorrection is presented in  @xcite .",
    "a multilevel smoothed aggregation algorithm and its convergence analysis are found in  @xcite and , in  @xcite , an improved convergence theory of the method is presented .",
    "the latter theory is then extended to allow for aggressive coarsening , provided an appropriate polynomial smoother is used  @xcite . a further generalization known as adaptive smoothed aggregation",
    "is developed in  @xcite .",
    "variants of the above approaches continue to be developed for use in scientific computing and have been developed for higher order partial differential equations @xcite , convection diffusion problems  @xcite , markov chains @xcite , and the dirac equation in quantum chromodynamics  @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "an aggregation based algebraic multigrid method for the graph laplacian is presented .",
    "the approach constructs the sequence of coarse graphs recursively using a pair - wise aggregation , or matching , form of interpolation .",
    "however , it is demonstrated here , that the convergence rate of a two - level method based on such a construction is uniformly bounded for the graph laplacian on general graphs and , thus , can be used within an algebraic multilevel iteration ( amli ) @xcite as a preconditioner to the conjugate gradient iteration to obtain a nearly optimal solver .",
    "a noteworthy feature of the approach is its simplicity , which makes it possible to analyze the convergence and complexity of the method with few assumptions and without any geometric information .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ problem - description ] , we introduce the graph laplacian problem and discuss some of its applications . in section",
    "[ matching ] , we introduce a graph matching algorithm and demonstrate that the energy norm of the @xmath3 projection onto the coarse space is a key quantity in deriving convergence and complexity estimates of the method . additionally , we introduce an approach computing an approximation of the energy norm of this projection operator . in section [ twolevel ]",

    "the variational problem considered here is as follows : given an @xmath8 satisfying @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a constant vector , find a @xmath11 , where @xmath12 denotes the cardinality of the set of vertices @xmath5 , such that    @xmath13    where @xmath14 define the discrete gradient operator @xmath15 such that @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are standard euclidean bases .",

    "these properties can also be verified by the matrix form of @xmath19 defined in the following way @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the degree of the @xmath23-th vertex .",
    "efficient multilevel graph laplacian solvers are important in numerous application areas , including finite element and finite difference discretizations of elliptic partial differential equations ( pde ) , data mining , clustering in images , and as a preconditioner for weighted graph laplacians . moreover , the theory developed here for multilevel aggregation solvers applied to graph laplacians should provide insights on how to design a solver for more general weighted graph laplacians , which cover also anisotropic diffusion problems .",
