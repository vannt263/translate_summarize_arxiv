    "there are two most promising models to account for high - mass star formation ( m @xmath08 m@xmath1 ) .",
    "one is called the `` monolithic collapse and disk accretion '' @xcite , and the other is `` competitive accretion '' @xcite .",
    "the former one suggests that high - mass stars form directly from isolated massive gas clumps like low - mass star formation but with a much larger accretion rate .",
    "the latter claims that high - mass stars form in the centre of a cluster through competitive gathering gas mass with the other off - centre protostars .",
    "the competitive accretion model was proposed based on the observational fact that most stars are formed in clusters , and most massive stars reside in the centre , i.e , mass segregation @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the mutual potential of the protostars in the cluster funnels gas down to the centre , which results in higher gas densities and higher accretion rates for the few protostars located there .",
    "thus the protostars located in the centre can accrete more and more gas and form massive stars . however ,",
    "till now , no convincing observational evidences support the `` competitive accretion '' model .",
    "what is the mass segregation in protoclusters ?",
    "how do the protostars interact with each other ?",
    "do the protostars competitively accumulate masses under a common potential ? to distinguish these two models , high spatial resolution observations towards protoclusters are critically needed .    located at a distance of 6 kpc , the dense clump g10.6 - 0.4 has been widely studied from centimeter to sub - millimetre wavelengths at various spatial resolutions ( e.g. , @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "the previous centimeter observations have pointed out burst of massive star formation in the central uc  hii region @xcite .",
    "a flatten rotating torus is found in the central parsec region of the dense clump @xcite .",
    "gas infalling was also revealed in the form of redshifted absorption seen against the continuum source @xcite .",
    "multiple outflows were detected in the @xmath2co ( 21 ) and hcn ( 32 ) lines @xcite .",
    "all the previous observations indicate a high - mass star cluster is forming in a dense clump @xcite .",
    "thus it is a good target for testing different models for high mass star foramtion with sufficiently high spatial resolution observations and sensitive molecular tracers for infall motion . in previous vla observations @xcite ,",
    "the nh@xmath3 lines used as a tracer for infall motions only revealed the gas flow in the inner warm part near the central ultracompact hii region , which can not provide information of the infall motions in the other less dense and colder parts of the dense clump . in this paper , with the hcn ( 32 ) line , which is a good tracer for infall motions @xcite , we can reveal the pattern of infall motions in the whole dense clump and uncover the accretion mode for the formation of a high - mass star cluster .",
    "the observations of g10.6 + 0.4 were carried out with the sma in july 2005 with seven antennas in its compact configuration and in september 2005 with six antennas in its extended configuration .",
    "the integration time on source before flagging for the compact array and extended array is 139 minutes and 108 minutes , respectively .",
    "the phase reference centre of both observations was r.a.(j2000 )  =  18@xmath410@xmath528.698@xmath6 and dec.(j2000 )  =  -@xmath7 .",
    "the 345 ghz receivers were tuned to 265 ghz for the lower sideband ( lsb ) and 275  ghz for the upper sideband ( usb ) .",
    "the frequency resolution across the spectral band is 0.8125  mhz or @xmath81 km s@xmath9 for both configurations .    in both configuration observations , jupiter , uranus and qso 3c454.3",
    "were observed for antenna - based bandpass correction .",
    "qsos 1741 - 038 and 1908 - 201 were employed for antenna - based gain correction .",
    "uranus was observed for flux - density calibration .",
    "miriad was employed for calibration and imaging @xcite .",
    "the 1.1 mm continuum data were acquired by averaging all the line - free channels over both the 2 ghz of upper and lower spectral bands .",
    "miriad task `` selfcal '' was employed to perform self - calibration on the continuum data . the gain solutions from the self - calibration",
    "were applied to the line data .",
    "the synthesized beam size and 1 @xmath10 rms of the dust emission observed in the compact configuration is @xmath11 ( pa=-45.7@xmath12 ) and 30 mjy  beam@xmath9 , respectively .",
    "the continuum data combined from both configurations yield a synthesized beam of 1@xmath13 , p.a.=-61@xmath12.6 , and 1 @xmath10 rms of 10 mjy  beam@xmath9 in the uniform weighted map .",
    "the hcn ( 32 ) ( 265.886 ghz ) and ch@xmath3oh ( 5@xmath14 - 4@xmath15 ) ( 266.838 ) lines were observed at the lower band , while the ch@xmath3cn ( 15 - 14 ) transitions were observed at upper band .",
    "the typical 1 @xmath10 rms of line emission is @xmath8150 mjy  beam@xmath9 .",
    "irac data were also retrieved from the database of glimpse .",
    "the 1.1 mm continuum image obtained from the sma compact array is shown in red solid contours in the upper panel of figure 1 . as well as the central elongated clump , two small clumps were found in the north - east and north - west .",
    "the two uc  hii regions identified by @xcite were denoted as black plus symbols .",
    "the emission peak of the 1.1 mm continuum emission coincides with the central bright uc  hii region .",
    "the deconvolved size of the large clump is 3@xmath16 ( p.a.=-64.1@xmath12 ) . by combining the data of the compact and extended configurations of sma",
    ", we obtained a much higher spatial resolution ( 1@xmath13 , p.a.=-61@xmath12.6 ) image of the 1.1 mm dust continuum emission .",
    "as shown in the lower panel of figure 1 , the large clump detected by the compact array is further resolved into seven dense cores , which are denoted from `` a '' to `` g '' .",
    "we applied two dimensional gaussian fits towards these cores .",
    "the positions , integrated intensity and radii of these cores are listed in columns 2 - 4 of table 1 .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     the redshifted absorption in the hcn ( 32 ) lines observed by the sma indicates gas infall in clump scale @xcite .",
    "interferometers can resolve out the extended emission and create kind of artifacts that may appear like absorption features , especially close to the line centre .",
    "however , the absorption dips in the hcn ( 32 ) line are redshifted by several km  s@xmath9 from the systemic velocity , which should not be caused by the missing flux .",
    "especially , the hcn ( 32 ) line towards core d , f and g shows clearly inverse p - cygni profiles with the absorption dips @xmath85 k ( @xmath17 ) below the continuum , indicating gas infall towards the bright continuum background @xcite . in figure 3 , we also noticed that the absorption of hcn ( 32 ) is associated with the continuum emission , indicating the absorption feature of hcn ( 32 ) lines are real rather than artificial . from the last panel of figure 2",
    ", one can find that the absorption dip of hcn ( 32 ) line averaged over the whole clump is at @xmath81 km  s@xmath9 .",
    "the absorption dip of hcn ( 32 ) line towards the central core `` d '' is also at @xmath81 km  s@xmath9 .",
    "in contrast to `` d '' , the absorption dips of hcn ( 32 ) lines are slightly blueshifted towards the eastern cores and redshifted towards the western cores , indicating that the infalling gas is from a common cold and slowly rotating envelope . in other words ,",
    "the clump is in overall collapse .",
    "the gas infall is dominated by the whole clump rather than by individual cores .    to investigate the properties of the infalling gas , the profiles of the hcn ( 32 )",
    "line were modeled with an enhanced version of the `` two - layer '' method @xcite . in that model , a continuum source is located in between the two layers .",
    "each layer has peak optical depth @xmath18 , velocity dispersion @xmath19 , and relative speed @xmath20 between the continuum source and the gas in the two layers .",
    "the gas is approaching the continuum source if @xmath20 is positive . the line brightness temperature at velocity v is @xcite : @xmath21+(1-\\phi)(j_{r}-j_{b})\\\\ \\times[1-exp(-\\tau_{r}-\\tau_{f})]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 and @xmath23\\ ] ] @xmath24\\ ] ] @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 are the planck temperatures of the continuum source , the `` front '' layer , the `` rear '' layer and the cosmic background radiation , respectively .",
    "@xmath29 is related to the blackbody temperature t at frequency @xmath30 , where h is planck s constant , and k is boltzmann s constant @xcite . @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the filling factors and the systemic velocities of the continuum sources , respectively .",
    "the blueshifted emission of hcn ( 32 ) at core `` f '' and `` g '' and redshifted emission of hcn ( 32 ) at core `` b '' may be contaminated by outflow emission .",
    "thus we only use the -6 to 5 km  s@xmath9 part of the lines in the fitting .",
    "we used a nonlinear least - squares method ( the levenberg - marquardt algorithm coded within idl ) to obtain the best - fit models for the observational lines .",
    "the best fits are displayed in figure 2 as blue curves and the parameters of the best fits are summarized in table 2 .    from the seventh column of table 1 and the seventh column of table 2",
    ", we noticed that the systemic velocities of each core obtained from gaussian fits to ch@xmath3oh ( 5@xmath144@xmath15 ) lines are slightly different from that obtained from modeling to hcn ( 32 ) lines .",
    "this difference may be due to two factors .",
    "firstly , since ch@xmath3oh ( 5@xmath144@xmath15 ) and hcn ( 32 ) have different critical densities and excitation temperatures , these two molecular lines may trace different layers of the gas . while different layers of the gas may have various velocities .",
    "secondly , the ch@xmath3oh ( 5@xmath144@xmath15 ) lines at some positions ( e.g. `` a '' and `` e '' ) may be optically thick and deviate from gaussian shape .",
    "however , roughly speaking , in contrast with the central core ( `` d '' ) , the western cores have redshifted velocities and the eastern cores have blueshifted velocities , indicating the off - centre cores are rotating around the central core .",
    "the last column of table 2 presents the relative velocities of the cores to the infalling gas . besides core `` e '' ,",
    "the relative velocities of the other cores are all much larger than the thermal velocity , indicating the infall motion of the gas is supersonic . for free - fall case",
    ", the infall radius can be estimated as : @xmath33 for the central core , the infall velocity is 2.8 km  s@xmath9 at a radius of @xmath80.23 pc . from nh@xmath3 ( 3,3 ) observations , @xcite detected a free - fall collapse speed of 6.5 km  s@xmath9 at a radius of 0.03 pc .",
    "this indicates that the inside of the clump collapses faster than outside .",
    "the kinematic mass infall rate can be calculated using dm / dt=@xmath34 , where v@xmath35 is the infall velocity , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the infall velocity , the mean molecular weight , and the h@xmath38 mass , respectively . taking v@xmath35=6.5 km  s@xmath9 , r@xmath35=0.03 pc and n=3@xmath39 @xmath40 ,",
    "the kinematic mass infall rate is 1.5@xmath41 m@xmath1  yr@xmath9 .",
    "the `` competitive accretion '' model predicts the accretion rates in the virialized cluster are primarily determined by the bondi - hoyle type accretion rates @xcite .",
    "however , this argument was often doubted and criticized by people @xcite .",
    "the bondi - hoyle type accretion rates are believed too low to significantly increase the protostars masses due to large velocity dispersion in turbulent cores @xcite . and",
    "the radiative feedback from the massive protostars may also prevent bondi - hoyle accretions in the cluster @xcite . does the mass accretion in g10.6 - 0.4 favor the bondi - hoyle type accretion ?",
    "the bondi - hoyle accretion rate of the central core ( `` d '' ) is calculated as @xcite : @xmath42 where g is the gravitational constant , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the mean density and the stellar mass , respectively . the one dimensional velocity dispersion @xmath45 . for the central core ( `` d '' ) , the one dimensional thermal velocity dispersion @xmath46=0.69 km  s@xmath9 , where @xmath47 and t@xmath48=161 k. the one dimensional non - thermal velocity dispersion is estimated from the ch@xmath3oh ( 5@xmath14 - 4@xmath15 ) line through @xmath49=2.17 km  s@xmath9 .",
    "thus the one dimensional velocity dispersion of the central core is 2.28 km  s@xmath9 . by inferring the rate of lyman continuum photon production , @xcite",
    "suggest the central core contains four o4 v stars with a total mass of 175 m@xmath1 . assuming @xmath44=175 m@xmath1 , the bondi - hoyle accretion rate is 2.4@xmath41 m@xmath1  yr@xmath9 , which is similar to the kinematic mass infall rate .",
    "however , @xcite have pointed out that the bondi - hoyle formula may underestimate the mean accretion rate in supersonically turbulent gas .",
    "but the rate of bondi - hoyle accretion onto stars larger than @xmath810 m@xmath1 is likely to be substantially reduced by radiation pressure@xcite .",
    "thus our calculation of bondi - hoyle accretion rate should be zeroth - order estimation and needs to be greatly modified by considering other factors like vorticity , radiation pressure and magnetic fields@xcite .",
    "however , our analysis indicates that the accretion in the central region is dominated by stellar potential and the central massive core has accumulated enough mass to maintain a large accretion rate even though the velocity dispersion is very larger and supersonic .",
    "the ignition of the nuclear reaction can be delayed with such high accretion rate until the star grows massive enough@xcite .",
    "but the presence of uc hii region indicates that the protostars in the central region of g10.6 - 0.4 have accumulated large enough mass to produce ionizing radiation .",
    "in addition , the central massive protostars seem to continue growing mass by accreting ionized gas passing through the ionization boundary of the ultracompact hii region @xcite .",
    "in `` monolithic collapse and disk accretion '' , the cores in the clumps collapse individually to form stars . however , in g10.6 - 0.4 region , the cloud / clump seems to be in overall collapse .",
    "the central dense core ( core `` d '' ) has much larger mass than the off - centre cores . in free - fall case ,",
    "the accretion domain ( @xmath5047440 au ) of the central core is much larger than the clump size ( @xmath810000 au ) , indicating that the central dense core dominates the gravity of the clump and thus can competitively gather gas mass with the other off - centre protostars from the gas reservoir of the clump .",
    "we also noticed the gas infall in this region is dominated by the central protostars in bondi - hoyle accretion mode .",
    "the difference between the `` competitive accretion '' model and the `` monolithic collapse and disk accretion '' lies primarily in how and when the mass is gathered to form the massive star @xcite .",
    "does it occur in the pre - stellar stage due to turbulence , or does it occur subsequently due to accretion in a common potential @xcite .",
    "g10.6 - 0.4 is a much evolved protocluster .",
    "but the protostars and their gas reservoirs ( dense cores ) in g10.6 - 0.4 are still accumulating masses from the gas reservoir of the clump , indicating that the cores in g10.6 - 0.4 are most likely formed due to accretion rather than pre - existing .",
    "@xcite detected several 5 pc scale filaments connected with the central region of g10.6 - 0.4 .",
    "they argued that the filaments may facilitate mass accretion onto the central cluster - forming region .",
    "the overall collapse of the clump and the large scale filaments indicate that the mutual potential of the protocluster likely funnels gas from the natal cloud down to the centre .",
    "this picture favors the `` competitive accretion '' model .",
    "the standard deviations of core velocities measured from ch@xmath3oh ( 5@xmath144@xmath15 ) lines and hcn ( 32 ) lines are @xmath82.5 and @xmath80.8 km  s@xmath9 , both of which are larger than the thermal velocity dispersion of the clump ( @xmath80.5 km  s@xmath9 assuming t@xmath48=87 k ) .",
    "the velocity differences between most of the cores and the cloud / clump ( -3 km  s@xmath9 ) are also higher than the thermal velocity dispersion . from the last column of table 1",
    ", we noticed the non - thermal velocity dispersion of the cores are much larger than the thermal velocity dispersion . in `` monolithic collapse and disk accretion ''",
    ", the cores in a clump do not interact with each other and collapse individually , leading to low sonic velocity dispersion of the gas and small velocity differences between cores and their envelopes@xcite . while the velocity dispersion of the gas increases with mass and can reach as high as several km  s@xmath9 in the `` competitive accretion '' model@xcite .",
    "the `` competitive accretion '' model also predicts high relative gas velocities in a stellar - dominated potential .    at the present time",
    ", we can not make unambivalent conclusion that the protocluster in g10.6 - 0.4 is formed through competitive accretion due to uncertainties in estimating the masses and mass infall rates .",
    "however , we clearly revealed the mass segregation in this region and the cores seem to still accumulate masses due to a common potential . further higher sensitivity and resolution observations especially from the alma can give a more thorough understanding of the situations in this region especially of the interaction among the individual cores .",
    "we present the sma observations both in the 1.1 mm continuum and molecular line emission toward the high - mass star forming complex in g10.6 - 0.4 .",
    "the main results of this study are as follows .",
    "the 1.1 mm dust emission fragments into seven dense cores .",
    "the central one has the largest mass of @xmath8207 m@xmath1 , while the off - centre ones have much smaller masses .",
    "the gas emission reveals by hcn ( 32 ) and ch@xmath3oh ( 5@xmath144@xmath15 ) lines also fragments into several dense cores .",
    "the dense cores revealed by the ch@xmath3oh ( 5@xmath144@xmath15 ) emission align along a filamentary structure with a length of @xmath80.5 pc . the kinetic temperature and volume density of the central core inferred from lvg modeling to ch@xmath3cn ( 15 - 14 ) lines",
    "are @xmath8161 k and @xmath51 @xmath40 .",
    "thus the thickness of the filamentary structure in ch@xmath3oh ( 5@xmath144@xmath15 ) emission is @xmath80.4 pc , which is comparable to its length , indicating the filamentary structure is not a real filament but an edge - on disk - like structure .",
    "there exists a large velocity gradient from west to east , indicating the whole clump is in rotating .",
    "the hcn ( 32 ) lines towards all the dust cores show redshifted absorption dips ( inverse p - cygni profile ) , indicating gas infall in this region .",
    "the positions of the absorption dips at different cores are nearly at the same velocity ( @xmath81 km  s@xmath9 ) , indicating that the collapse is takeing place in clump scale rather than core scale . in other words ,",
    "the gas is accreted due to the common potential of the proto - cluster rather than due to individual cores .",
    "the single - dish observations of hcn ( 32 ) also support large scale collapse in cloud scale .",
    "we also found that the bondi - hoyle accretion can explain the gas accretion in the forming cluster of g10.6 - 0.4 .",
    "the non - thermal motion in this region is supersonic .",
    "the standard deviation of core velocities is also larger than the thermal velocity dispersion .",
    "the velocity differences between the cores and the cloud / clump are also larger than the thermal velocity dispersion . through modeling the hcn ( 32 ) lines",
    ", we found the relative velocities between the dust continuum sources and the infalling gas are much larger than thermal velocity dispersion , indicating the infall is supersonic .",
    "the observed picture in g10.6 - 0.4 region seems to favor the `` competitive accretion model '' , which needs to be tested by future observations .",
