    "the search for higgs bosons is among the prime tasks of the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite .",
    "while the standard model ( sm ) of elementary - particle physics contains one complex higgs doublet , from which one neutral @xmath0-even higgs boson @xmath2 emerges in the physical particle spectrum after the spontaneous breakdown of the electroweak symmetry , the higgs sector of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm ) consists of a two - higgs - doublet model ( 2hdm ) and accommodates a quintet of physical higgs bosons : the neutral @xmath0-even @xmath3 and @xmath4 bosons , the neutral @xmath0-odd @xmath5 boson , and the charged @xmath6-boson pair . at the tree level , the mssm higgs sector has two free parameters , which are usually taken to be the mass @xmath7 of the @xmath5 boson and the ratio @xmath8 of the vacuum expectation values of the two higgs doublets .    in the following ,",
    "we focus our attention on the @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 bosons , which we collectively denote by @xmath9 .",
    "a recent discussion of @xmath6-boson production at the lhc may be found in refs .",
    "@xcite and the references cited therein .",
    "the dominant source of @xmath9 bosons is their single production by @xmath10 fusion , @xmath11 , which is mediated by heavy - quark @xcite and squark @xcite loops .",
    "another , less important mechanism of single @xmath9-boson production is @xmath12 @xcite .",

    ", they need to be produced in association with one or more other particles or jets ( @xmath14 ) . in leading order ( lo ) , @xmath15 associated production proceeds through the partonic subprocesses @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , which again involve heavy - quark @xcite and squark @xcite loops .",
    "alternatively , the @xmath9 bosons can be produced , with interesting rates , in association with ( i ) a dijet via intermediate - boson fusion , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 stand for any light flavor of quark or antiquark , @xmath22 , and virtual particles are marked by an asterisk @xcite ; ( ii ) a quark - antiquark pair of heavy flavor @xmath23 via @xmath24 @xcite ; ( iii ) an intermediate boson via @xmath25 @xcite , @xmath26 @xcite , and @xmath27 @xcite ; or ( iv ) another , possibly different @xmath9 boson via @xmath28 @xcite and @xmath29 @xcite .",

    "the squark loop contributions to these two mssm processes vanish @xcite for reasons explained below .",

    "@xcite , which does not contain an analytic expression for the partonic cross section either .",

    "recently , the helicity amplitudes of @xmath27 with @xmath42 were analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite with regard to the asymptotic helicity conservation property of supersymmetry , and their real and imaginary parts were graphically presented at a specific scattering angle as functions of the center - of - mass ( c.m . )",
    "energy .    with the higgs hunt at the lhc being in full swing",
    ", it is an urgent matter to consolidate our knowledge of @xmath34 associated hadroproduction via gluon fusion in the mssm , which is the motivation of this paper .",
    "specifically , we present compact analytic expressions , also for the partonic cross sections of @xmath43 @xcite , and perform a detailed numerical analysis using up - to - date input .",
    "the importance of @xmath44-initiated subprocesses for higgs - boson production has been variously emphasized in the literature , in particular , in connection with the final states @xmath9 @xcite , @xmath45 @xcite , @xmath46 @xcite , and @xmath47 @xcite .",

    ", it should be noted that the treatment of bottom as an active flavor inside the colliding hadrons leads to an effective description , which comprises contributions from the higher - order subprocesses @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 .",

    "the evaluation of @xmath65 with an unsubtracted @xmath48-quark pdf is expected to slightly overestimate the true cross section @xcite . for simplicity",
    ", we shall nevertheless adopt this effective approach in our analysis , keeping in mind that a qcd - correction factor below unity is to be applied .",
    "in fact , such a behavior has recently been observed for @xmath66 @xcite .    in order to reduce the number of unknown supersymmetric input parameters ,",
    "we adopt a scenario where the mssm is embedded in a grand unified theory ( gut ) involving supergravity ( sugra ) @xcite .",
    "the mssm thus constrained is characterized by the following parameters at the gut scale , which come in addition to @xmath49 and @xmath7 : the universal scalar mass @xmath67 , the universal gaugino mass @xmath68 , the trilinear higgs - sfermion coupling @xmath69 , the bilinear higgs coupling @xmath70 , and the higgs - higgsino mass parameter @xmath71 .",
    "notice that @xmath7 is then not an independent parameter anymore , but it is fixed through the renormalization group equation .",
    "the number of parameters can be further reduced by making additional assumptions .",
    "unification of the @xmath72-lepton and @xmath48-quark yukawa couplings at the gut scale leads to a correlation between @xmath73 and @xmath49 . furthermore ,",
    "if the electroweak symmetry is broken radiatively , then @xmath70 and @xmath71 are determined up to the sign of @xmath71 .",
    "finally , it turns out that the mssm parameters are nearly independent of the value of @xmath69 , as long as @xmath74  gev at the gut scale .",
