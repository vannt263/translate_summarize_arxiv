    "in recent years the cosmological picture that over 95% of the energy in our universe is contributed by a dark sector has been supported independently by a number of observations , notably those of type ia supernovae ( sn ) luminosity distances , cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies , the power spectrum of clustered matter , and weak lensing @xcite .",
    "this dark sector can be further subdivided into dark matter and dark energy according to their different gravitational properties .",
    "the concordance @xmath0cdm paradigm , in which dark matter is assumed to be weakly ( or just gravitationally ) interacting massive particles ( the cold dark matter ) , and dark energy is a positive cosmological constant ( @xmath0 ) or slowly varying scalar field , has been successful in confronting all these observational data sets .",
    "however , the smallness of the cosmological constant , and the fact that it only becomes dominant recently make this model conceptually unattractive and stimulates the examination of new models ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "since both cold dark matter ( cdm ) and dark energy are invisible and have as yet unknown origins , it is natural to consider the possibility that they are actually not two exotic matter species but just different aspects of a single fluid .",
    "these scenarios are frequently dubbed unified dark matter ( udm ) models . in the context of general relativity",
    "they assume an equation of state @xmath2 or @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the hubble rate ; in universes with zero spatial curvature these prescriptions are identical .",
    "a particular class of cosmology with this equation of state was investigated in the context of studies of cosmological bulk viscosity @xcite in which the viscosity coefficient is @xmath5 and the effective pressure in the friedmann equation is @xmath6 , and of string production effects turok which mimic the effects of bulk viscosity of this form with @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the flat bulk viscous cosmologies also include as subcases the so called chaplygin gas model ( @xmath8 ) @xcite , which is just a bulk viscosity for dust ( @xmath9 ) with @xmath10 , and its generalizations to @xmath11 @xcite , which is just @xmath12 and @xmath13 , or other functional forms @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the chaplygin gas models are simple , with no new dynamical degrees of freedom , and yet produce an interesting time - evolution for the dark energy .",
    "however , it was shown subsequently that the density perturbation of this fluid will either blow up or experience rapid oscillatory damping at late times , so the models can be stringently constrained by the matter power spectrum @xcite .",
    "this distinctive behaviour arises because there is a minimum possible total density of the universe at late times .",
    "there have been some explicit investigations in the bulk viscous cosmology in connection with the dark energy problem .",
    "et  al_.  fabris2006 , colistete2007 investigated the case in which the viscosity coefficient has the form @xmath15 and considered both background and perturbed evolutions of a universe dominated by viscous matter .",
    "however , these studies were limited by certain simplifications . in ref .",
    "@xcite , for example , the authors obtained analytical solution for @xmath16 ( where the subscript @xmath17 denotes viscous matter ) as a function of scale factor @xmath18 , under the assumption that no other matter species exist in the universe ( the same assumption as @xcite ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors added a baryonic matter species and estimated the cosmological parameters in detail using bayesian statistics ; but their calculation was largely confined to the special case @xmath19 and used only supernovae data to derive the constraints .",
    "we believe that such an analysis needs to be generalized .",
    "first , as will be seen below , @xmath19 is not necessarily the best fit for these models , even for the background cosmology .",
    "second , no radiation component was included in previous analysis .",
    "this is a reasonable simplification as long as we are only concerned with the late - time cosmic expansion and only using the supernova data .",
    "but when observables are also related to the high - redshift features , such as the cmb shift parameter , the radiation must be taken into account .",
    "in fact , the properties of the viscosity could significantly modify the early - time evolution of the universe if the late - time evolution is consistent with the supernova data , and so the cmb shift parameter could be effective in constraining the model .",
    "third , a detailed study of the linear perturbations in the model is needed as a critical check of the model s feasibility .",
    "as we will see below , the udm model based on viscous matter has several distinctive predictions regarding the perturbations when compared to the @xmath20cdm paradigm or the chaplygin gas model .",
    "such a feature is very general , making the model barely compatible with observations .",
    "this indicates that a udm model without new dynamical degrees of freedom is unlikely to be observationally acceptable .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "[ sect : equations ] , we give the basic field equations which will be used in the subsequent analysis . in   [ sect : backgroundevolution ] we consider the background evolution of a universe dominated by a viscous matter ( in the presence of normal matter species such as baryons , photons and neutrinos ) . using the sn data and cmb shift parameter , we find the best - fit model parameters and show that these give a background cosmology very similar to the prediction of the @xmath0cdm paradigm .",
    "[ sect : perturbedevolution ] is devoted to the perturbed evolution of general bulk viscosity models , which we find to behave very differently from both @xmath0cdm and other udm models .",
    "finally , we discuss our results and conclude in   [ sect : conclusion ] .",
    "we will frequently call the udm fluid with @xmath21 the viscous dark matter.",
    "in this section we list the general field equations that govern the evolution of the cosmological background and its first - order perturbations in general relativity , which will be used in later sections .",
    "the perturbation equations will be given in the covariant and gauge invariant ( cgi ) formalism , using the method of @xmath22 decomposition .",
    "the main idea of @xmath22 decomposition is to make spacetime splits of physical quantities with respect to the 4-velocity @xmath23 of an observer .",
    "the projection tensor @xmath24 is defined as @xmath25 and can be used to obtain covariant tensors perpendicular to @xmath26 .",
    "for example , the covariant spatial derivative @xmath27 of a tensor field @xmath28 is defined as @xmath29the energy - momentum tensor and covariant derivative of the 4-velocity are decomposed respectively as @xmath30 in the above , @xmath31 is the projected symmetric trace - free ( pstf ) anisotropic stress , @xmath32 the vector heat flux vector , @xmath33 the isotropic pressure , @xmath34 the pstf shear tensor , @xmath35}$ ] , the vorticity , @xmath36 ( @xmath18 is the mean expansion scale factor ) the expansion scalar , and @xmath37 the acceleration ; the overdot denotes time derivative expressed as @xmath38 , brackets mean antisymmetrisation , and parentheses symmetrization . the 4-velocity normalization is chosen to be @xmath39 .",
    "the quantities @xmath40 are referred to as _",
    "dynamical _ quantities and @xmath41 as _ kinematical _ quantities . note that the dynamical quantities can be obtained from the energy - momentum tensor @xmath42 through the relations @xmath43    decomposing the riemann tensor and making use the einstein equations , we obtain , after linearization , a set of propagation and constraint equations governing the evolution of perturbed physical quantities . here",
    "we shall only list the equations that will be used in later sections , and for more details we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "the first equation we will use is the raychaudhuri equation @xmath44    the second equation to be used involves the projected ricci scalar @xmath45 into the hypersurfaces orthogonal to @xmath23 , which can be expressed as @xmath46 since we are considering a spatially - flat universe , the spatial curvature vanishes ( at background level ) on large scales and so @xmath47 .",
    "thus , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : spatialriccicurvature ] ) , we obtain @xmath48 which is the friedmann equation that governs the expansion of the universe in standard general relativity .",
    "furthermore , we will need the conservation equations for the energy - momentum tensor @xmath49    eqs .",
    "( [ eq : raychaudhrui ] , [ eq : energyconservation ] , [ eq : conserv_q ] ) involves both background and first - order perturbed quantities ( such as @xmath50 , @xmath32 ) . to obtain equations for the background cosmology",
    "it is sufficient to neglect all first - order terms , while to obtain corresponding equations for the perturbation evolution we need to take the spatial derivatives",
    "@xmath51 [ cf .",
    "( [ eq : aeeom ] ) ] of these equations . for the perturbation analysis",
    "it is then more convenient to work in the @xmath52 space because we shall confine ourselves to the linear regime where different @xmath52-modes decouple .",
    "following @xcite , we make the following harmonic expansions of our perturbation variables : @xmath53 in which @xmath54 is the eigenfunction of the comoving spatial laplacian @xmath55 satisfying @xmath56 and @xmath57 are given by @xmath58 .    the perturbed version of eq .",
    "( [ eq : energyconservation ] ) is @xmath59 in   [ sect : perturbedevolution ] we shall use the harmonic expansion coefficients of eqs .  ( [ eq : raychaudhrui ] , [ eq : conserv_q ] , [ eq : conserv_rho ] ) to derive the evolution equation for the density perturbation of the viscous dark matter .",
    "the field equations governing the background cosmic expansion are the friedmann equation , the raychaudhuri equation and the conservation equations for energy densities of the different matter species ( baryons , radiation , and viscous dark matter ) .",
    "not all these equations are independent , and we choose the friedmann equation ( here @xmath60 ) @xmath61 and the conservation equations @xmath62 as our starting point . in these equations",
    "@xmath63 and @xmath64 are respectively the energy densities of baryonic matter , radiation and the ( viscous ) dark matter .",
    "the pressure @xmath65 is the effective pressure of the dark matter , with @xmath66 being our free model parameters .",
    "we shall not follow @xcite by dividing @xmath64 into different components with different equation of states ( eos ) , although it can be useful mathematically , since that might hide the fact that there is only a single fluid with varying eos .",
    "when it comes to the perturbative evolution of this fluid , it will be misleading if one thinks that part of the fluid behaves as a cosmological constant which has no perturbation , while another part simply clusters as cdm , there being _ no _ interactions between them .",
    "we also note that the hubble expansion rate @xmath4 appears in the expression of @xmath67 , which means that the eos of the viscous dark matter depends also on the existence and properties of other matter species , and so we can not neglect the effects of baryonic matter and radiation ( at early times ) .     and",
    "@xmath68 from supernovae and cmb shift - parameter data .",
    "the dark grey and light grey areas denote the 68% and 95% confidence regions respectively . the current hubble expansion rate @xmath69 is marginalized over analytically and the other parameters used are @xmath70 and @xmath71 evaluated at the present time .",
    "]    next , we estimate the free model parameters @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "we will set @xmath9 in all the calculations below because we want the viscous dark matter to behave like cdm at ( early ) times when the correction term is not important .",
    "for @xmath73 , earlier studies @xcite showed that when @xmath74 the universe will start from a de sitter phase and finally evolve towards power - law perfect - fluid dominated expansion , while if @xmath75 it is just the opposite , with late - time approach to de sitter evolution ; the special @xmath76 case corresponds to power law evolution throughout .",
    "in fact , from the expression @xmath77 we can see that if @xmath78 dominates over other matter species ( so that @xmath79 ) then @xmath67 will be a constant if @xmath80 .",
    "we can estimate that the best fit value of @xmath73 is around @xmath81 . in",
    "what follows , @xmath73 will be taken as a free parameter to be constrained by data .",
    "finally , @xmath82 is obviously a dimensional constant . to determine its value",
    ", we note that to explain the sne data we need the candidate for dark energy to contribute an effective energy density and pressure of the same order as @xmath83 in the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "thus , we have @xmath84 in which the quantities on the left - hand sides are for our model while those on the right hand sides are for the @xmath85cdm model .",
    "a subscript @xmath86 here denotes the present value of a quantity . using the results @xmath87 and @xmath88",
    ", we calculate from the above two equations that @xmath89 .",
    "this gives us a sense about the magnitude of the dimensionless quantity @xmath90 , which is chosen as another model parameter instead of @xmath91 and will be constrained below .    with the above preliminaries",

    "despite the excellent coincidence between the viscous dark matter and @xmath20cdm models for the background evolution found in the last section , we should also investigate the formation of large - scale structure to test whether the viscous model is also a feasible model for dark energy . in this section",
    "we show that , generally , a bulk viscosity depending on the energy density , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath114 , will significantly influence the formation and evolution of large - scale cosmological structure .",

    "for an observer comoving with dark matter particles ( with 4-velocity @xmath118 ) , the energy momentum tensor could be written as @xmath119 in the @xmath0cdm paradigm , if one chooses the observer to be comoving with the dark matter particles as above , then obviously the peculiar velocity is zero , @xmath120 , which implies , by the conservation of energy - momentum tensor , that @xmath121 for this observer , and there is no acceleration . in the bulk viscous model ,",
    "however , @xmath120 and @xmath122 are different choices of frame which can be used in numerical calculations . here , for convenience , we will choose the @xmath120 frame , in which , again from the conservation of energy , @xmath123 , which is easy to understand because the dark - matter particles themselves have interactions ( the pressure @xmath67 ) and can not be acceleration - free .",
    "taking the spatial derivative of @xmath67 and picking the harmonic coefficients , we obtain @xmath124 where @xmath125 with @xmath126 ( @xmath127 is the conformal time defined by @xmath128 ) and @xmath129 is the density contrast of the viscous dark matter .    as the anisotropic stress vanishes up to first order in perturbations , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : conserv_q ] ) we obtain @xmath130 similarly , from eq .",

    "this qualitative feature can be seen in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : figure3 ] , where we plot the evolution of the dark matter density contrast , @xmath151 for four different length scales , @xmath152 , for our best - fit model parameters ( @xmath153 ) .",
    "we see that the evolution of @xmath154 deviates from that predicted by the @xmath0cdm model only at late times , but nonetheless significantly .",
    "the scale - dependent evolution of density contrast is actually a general feature in the udm models without new dynamical degrees of freedom @xcite    the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : figure3 ] displays the evolution of the baryon density contrast @xmath155 . because viscous dark matter clusters more weakly than cold dark matter , the gravitational potential that the baryons lie in is also weaker , making the baryons less clustered .",
    "however , since this effect is indirect , the deviation of @xmath156 from the @xmath0cdm prediction is considerably smaller than that of @xmath157 .",
    "note that the galaxy surveys actually measure the clustering of luminous ( baryonic ) matter , rather than that of dark matter .",
    "consequently , these measurements can only be applied to @xmath158 , which is just weakly dependent on the model parameters @xcite . nevertheless , as in the bulk viscous model , both the amplitude and the shape of baryonic matter power spectrum are distinct from those predicted by the @xmath85cdm paradigm , and therefore we expect that stringent constraints can be obtained from it .     in the bulk viscosity model ( solid curve ) as compared to the results for the standard @xmath0cdm paradigm ( dashed curves ) .",

    "( [ eq : c3 ] , [ eq : c4 ] ) with @xmath167 .",
    "then , eq .  ( [ eq : a_evolve_clxc ] ) describes the evolution of the dark matter density contrast in the general case of @xmath168 .",
    "there are a couple of points to be noted about eq .",
    "( [ eq : a_evolve_clxc ] ) .",
    "first , it is clear that @xmath19 does not guarantee that @xmath169 and @xmath170 are zero , and the eos of the viscous dark matter @xmath171 is important . since @xmath172 if the viscous dark matter is responsible for accelerating the expansion of the universe , our conclusion that the evolution of dark matter density contrast will be sensitively scale - dependent and deviate significantly from @xmath0cdm will hold in general .",
    "note that this is different from the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite , which considers the special case of @xmath19 and concludes that the matter power spectrum in this model behaves well .",
    "second , eq .  ( [ eq : a_evolve_clxc ] ) is qualitatively different from its counterparts in other models which unify dark matter and dark energy , such as the ( generalized ) chaplygin gas model . in the latter we have generally @xmath173 and so the equation describes an under - damped oscillator rather than an over - damped one .",
    "consequently , the dark matter density contrast oscillates with ( rapidly ) decaying amplitude ( or blows up if @xmath170 is negative ) , in contrast to the monotonic decay in our model here .",
    "tracing the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : a_evolve_clxc ] ) , it is easy to find that the @xmath169 term comes from the term with @xmath139 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : a_clxcp ] ) , which is created by the fact that @xmath174 . we also note that eqs .",
    "( [ eq : c1 ] , [ eq : c2 ] ) are independent of @xmath73 and hence independent of the functional form of @xmath175 . as long as @xmath176",
    ", we will obtain a qualitative picture similar to the one given in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure3 ] .",
    "although the very different evolution of @xmath154 from that in @xmath0cdm is not directly reflected in the observed galaxy power spectrum , it will modify the gravitational potential and subsequently affect observables such as the cmb , weak lensing and cmb - galaxy cross - correlation . as the viscous dark matter contributes the majority of the total energy in the universe , a decay in its density contrast as in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure3 ] will also drive the gravitational potential @xmath177 to decay significantly .",
    "this point is verified in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure4 ] , which clearly shows that the decay of @xmath177 is much faster than that in the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "the fast decay of @xmath177 will enhance the integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect , which then contributes a source term @xmath178d\\tau $ ] to the cmb fluctuations , where @xmath179 is the spherical bessel function and @xmath180 the ( conformal ) time derivative of @xmath177 .",
    "this corresponds to more power in the cmb spectrum on large scales @xcite , as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure5 ] . note that the positions of the acoustic peaks for the two models are the same in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure5 ] , because their background evolutions are almost indistinguishable .",
    "we can see that comparison with cmb data could provide strong restrictions on the present model as well .",
    "again , because the damping in @xmath154 is a general feature in udm models based on bulk viscosity , so are the enhancements of the isw effect and the low-@xmath181 cmb power . in principle , the weak - lensing convergence power spectrum , which reflects the ( projected ) potential distribution along the line of sight , will also be modified ( as compared to the @xmath0cdm result ) significantly by the rapid decay of the potential .",
    "this is not considered here because the cmb spectrum itself already places stringent constraint on the model .",
    "to summarize , in this work we have investigated the background cosmological evolution and large - scale structure formation in the bulk viscous models designed as alternatives to dark energy .",
    "a bulk viscosity generates an effective pressure @xmath182  which , when the function @xmath183 is appropriately chosen , could drive the acceleration of the cosmic expansion .",
    "our numerical calculation focuses on a particular choice @xmath5 with @xmath184 being constants .",
    "such a choice has been considered before in the literature @xcite , in the contexts of both inflationary and late - time accelerating universes .",
    "it is interesting to note that with suitable values of @xmath73 , the viscous matter behaves as cold dark matter at early times and as a cosmological constant in the future ; thus this model naturally unifies dark matter and dark energy , at least at the background level .",
    "we have used the measurements of supernovae luminosity distance and cmb shift parameter to constrain the model parameters and found that for the best - fitting parameters , @xmath110 and @xmath185 ( @xmath186 ) , the background evolution of the universe is almost the same as that predicted by the @xmath0cdm model . from this viewpoint",
    "it seems that the model is a feasible alternative to an explicit cosmological constant .",
    "however , when it comes to the linear perturbations , the viscous dark matter starts to behave very differently from cold dark matter .",
    "the pressure of the viscous dark matter tends to resist the growth of the density contrast , and when it becomes significant ( at late times ) this effect can rapidly damp out the density perturbations , particularly on small scales . even though this smoothing of the viscous dark matter density perturbation can not be seen directly , it could reduce the growth rate of density perturbations in the luminous matter ( which can be measured by the galaxy power spectrum ) and drive the fast decay of the gravitational potential fluctuations , which subsequently modifies the large - scale cmb spectrum , weak lensing and cmb - galaxy cross - correlations .",
    "note that the model we consider has no explicit @xmath0cdm limit , _",
    "i.e. _ , one can not adjust the model parameters @xmath82 and @xmath73 to make the model reduce to @xmath0cdm exactly , unless a cosmological constant is added and the limit @xmath187 is taken .",
    "the latter case , in which we have both an explicit cosmological constant and viscous matter , is not particularly appealing because it will introduce more complexity without solving any of the problems of @xmath0cdm .",
    "rather , we are interested in whether the viscous dark matter alone could replace @xmath0cdm completely .",
    "this means that the eos parameter @xmath171 will necessarily be of order @xmath188 at late times .",
    "according to our analysis in ",
    "sect : perturbedevolution [ cf .  eqs .",
    "( [ eq : a_evolve_clxc]-[eq : c4 ] ) ] , it is the value of @xmath171 that determines the evolution of @xmath189 , and so we expect that all the qualitative pictures given in ",
    "sect : perturbedevolution will remain in place in any attempts to replace dark matter and dark energy with bulk viscous matter alone .",
    "viscous matter is therefore not a successful contender for the dark sector .",
    "the bulk viscosity model is another candidate to explain the dark energy without introducing dynamical degrees of freedom . in order to explain the accelerating cosmic expansion",
    ", one needs a negative ( effective ) pressure .",
    "if no new dynamical degree of freedom is introduced , the negative pressure should be either a constant , or a function of @xmath190 ( the energy density of the newly added matter ) , @xmath191 ( the energy density of the existing matter ) or @xmath4 , or combinations of these variables , which are all the possible variables in the background cosmology comment2 ( see @xcite for a counterexample however , where a new degree of freedom is added but is made non - dynamical ) .",
    "hence , we have the following conclusions for each of the allowed prescriptions for a form of newly added matter @xcite :    1 .",
    "the case @xmath192 is simply a cosmological constant .",
    "an example of the case @xmath193 is the ( generalized ) chaplygin gas model @xcite .",
    "the large - scale structure formation here has been considered in @xcite . in this class of models",
    "we have @xmath194 in general , and this leads to a term proportional to @xmath195 in the evolution equation for the density contrast @xmath196 of the _ newly added matter _ , and this term dominates on small scales ( @xmath197 ) .",
    "depending on the sign of this new term , @xmath196 will either blow up or oscillate and decay rapidly on small scales .",
    "+ note that this class of models are frequently considered as either udm models or dark energy models . in the former case ,",
    "as shown in @xcite , the constraints on the models are particularly stringent ( note however that , as pointed out in @xcite , in these models the nonlinear corrections can be important , which will make the simple linear treatments inaccurate or even incorrect , and will potentially significantly modify the background evolution as well , depending on the parameters used ) . in the latter case , density perturbations of cdm and baryons",
    "may not be affected significantly , much like the fact that in the above viscous model the baryons are not greatly affected",
    ". however , there generally will be other distinct new features of the model @xcite .",
    "examples for the case @xmath198 include the cardassian model @xcite , the palatini @xmath199 gravity @xcite and the @xmath200 brans - dicke theory with a potential , the linear perturbations of which have been considered in @xcite . in these models , by a similar argument as in the above , there will be a term proportional to @xmath201 in the evolution equation for the _ existing matter _ density perturbation @xmath202 . as a result , @xmath202 will experience blowing - up or rapidly decaying oscillation on small scales at late times .",
    "note , however , that in this class of models the averaging over the microscopic structure of the ( existing ) matter distribution may be a serious issue , rendering the appropriately averaged cosmological behaviour very different from naive predictions @xcite ( in a way similar to @xcite though with some differences , namely in @xcite the averaging is over microscopic scales while in @xcite it is over astronomical scales ) .",
    "this is because @xmath33 for the newly added matter depends algebraically on the density of normal matter particles , and could be very different inside and outside the distribution of the latter . as the normal matter particles only occupy a tiny portion of the total volume of the universe , after averaging , @xmath33 should be dominated by its value outside the normal matter particles ( _ i.e. _ , in the vacuum ) , which is likely to be a constant .",
    "the case @xmath3 includes bulk viscosity model with @xmath203 considered in @xcite , which is a special case for the general model we considered in this work , with @xmath204 . here , the dependence of @xmath33 on @xmath4 results in the evolution equation of @xmath196 for the _ newly added _ matter acquiring both a term proportional to @xmath195 and one proportional to @xmath205 .",
    "consequently , on small scales at late times , @xmath196 will decay rapidly without oscillation like an over - damped oscillator .",
    "we have shown that the udm model based on this is generally unable to pass several cosmological tests .",
    "note that as in the case of @xmath206 , the averaging issue again needs to be taken into account if more precise predictions are to be obtained @xcite , though its full effect and significance need careful nonlinear studies such as n - body simulations .    in all such cases ( except @xmath192 )",
    ", we have seen that the evolution of @xmath196 ( for either the existing matter or the newly added matter ) becomes very irregular .",
    "if the matter with irregular perturbation evolution makes a significant contribution to the total energy of the universe , then this will lead to large modifications to the @xmath0cdm predictions for the matter power spectrum , cmb , weak lensing and similar tests .",
    "this indicates that a viable dynamical udm model is likely to involve extra dynamical degrees of freedom in contrast to that provided by a ( generalized ) chaplygin gas or bulk viscosity @xcite .",
