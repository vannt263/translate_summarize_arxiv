    "the striking features of the nucleon structure function @xmath5 were first noted nearly 30 years ago by bloom and gilman  @xcite .",
    "they empirically observed two effects in data measured at slac : a ) the dual behaviour of the @xmath7 function that shows common features between the two kinematic regions corresponding to the nucleon resonances and deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) , b ) the extension of the scaling region to lower @xmath1 values when @xmath8 is plotted as a function of @xmath9 , the `` improved scaling variable '' .",
    "more precisely , they found that the smooth function @xmath10 measured at high @xmath1 in the dis region represents a good average over the resonances of the @xmath8 structure function measured at lower @xmath1 values .",
    "moreover , the duality appears to be valid locally .",
    "in fact , each of the most prominent resonance bumps , when averaged within its width , shows approximate scaling  @xcite .",
    "later on , in the framework of qcd , de rujula , georgi and politzer  @xcite provided the first explanation of the bloom - gilman duality .",
    "they evaluated the cornwall - norton  @xcite moments @xmath11 of the nucleon structure function @xmath5 , defined as @xmath12 using the operator product expansion ( ope ) they obtained the following expression @xmath13 where @xmath14 can be evaluated in the framework of perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) , and it is directly connected to the corresponding moment of the asymptotic limit of @xmath5 .",
    "the contribution of the higher twists , which is related to multi - parton correlations inside the nucleon and represented by @xmath15 , depends on the value of the constant @xmath16 in such a way that @xmath16 can be considered as a scale constant for higher twist effects .",
    "assuming a small value of the constant @xmath16 , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite showed that the contribution of the higher twists was relatively small , at least for low values of @xmath17 and for @xmath18 , justifying the observed dual behaviour of the structure function .",
    "it is now well established that the interpretation of the parton - hadron duality in light of qcd requires the evaluation of the moments of the nucleon structure functions and their evolution as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "current pqcd calculations can estimate the @xmath1 evolution up to the next - to - next - to - leading order , giving access to the interesting kinematic region of high @xmath4 and moderate @xmath1 where the multi - parton correlation contribution to the nucleon wave function becomes dominant .",
    "the interest in investigating multi - parton correlations in inelastic lepton scattering off the nucleon at large values of @xmath4 has recently been renewed , leading to a re - analysis of old @xmath5 data  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the results from ref .  @xcite and @xcite",
    "were mainly based on the analysis of fits of the structure function @xmath5 and therefore were still qualitative .",
    "moreover , the previous lack of data in the resonance region did not allow a model independent evaluation of the moments evolution to lower @xmath1 , and therefore offered very few opportunities to quantitatively investigate the role of qcd below the dis limit .",
    "the hall  c collaboration at the thomas jefferson national accelerator facility ( tjnaf ) has recently provided high quality data in this kinematic region  @xcite , allowing a more precise evaluation of the moments of the @xmath5 structure function of the proton  @xcite . however , like many other such measurements , the data were taken with a spectrometer of relatively small angular acceptance and the measured inclusive cross sections do not span a large continuous @xmath4 interval for constant @xmath1 .",
    "data taken in this manner follow a kinematic locus in @xmath1 vs. @xmath4 and require substantial interpolation to determine the @xmath5 moments .     experimental data on the structure function @xmath7 used for the moment evaluation in the clas kinematic region : points - world data ; shaded area - clas data .",
    "]    in this paper we report the first measurement in a wide continuous interval in @xmath4 and @xmath1 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : xandq2domain ] ) of the inclusive electron - proton scattering cross section .",
    "these measurements were performed at tjnaf with the clas detector in hall b. the @xmath5 structure function was extracted over the whole resonance region ( @xmath19  gev ) below @xmath20  ( gev / c)@xmath3 .",
    "this measurement , together with existing world data , allowed for the evaluation of the @xmath5 moments , drastically reducing the uncertainties related to data interpolation and providing the most detailed dependence on @xmath1 of the moments up to @xmath21 .",

    "@xcite adjusted to the jefferson lab data on the ratio @xmath22  @xcite , as described in ref .",

    "[ sec : dataanalysis ] we discuss the analysis of the data , including the extraction of the @xmath5 structure function from the cross section .",
    "the evaluation of the moments and uncertainties is also presented in section  [ sec : dataanalysis ] .",

    "until recently the studies of inclusive lepton - nucleon scattering represented the main source of information about nucleon structure . in the dis region ,",
    "measured structure functions can be directly connected to the parton momentum distribution of the nucleon in the framework of pqcd .",
    "after the successful interpretation of the dis region , the intermediate kinematic domain , situated at @xmath1 of a few ( gev / c)@xmath3 and large values of @xmath4 , attracted the interest of physicists . despite interpretation difficulties ,",
    "this region allows the study of multi - parton correlation contribution to the proton wave function .",

    "the clas detector is a magnetic spectrometer based on a six - coil torus magnet whose field is primarily oriented along the azimuthal direction .",
    "the sectors , located between the magnet coils , are instrumented individually to form six essentially independent magnetic spectrometers .",
    "the particle detection system includes drift chambers ( dc ) for track reconstruction  @xcite , scintillation counters ( tof ) for the time of flight measurement  @xcite , cherenkov counters ( cc ) for electron identification  @xcite , and electromagnetic calorimeters ( ec ) to measure neutrals and to improve the electron - pion separation  @xcite .",
    "the ec detectors have a granularity defined by triangular cells in the plane perpendicular to the incoming particles to study the electromagnetic shower shape and are longitudinally divided into two parts with the inner part acting as a pre - shower .",
    "charged particles can be detected and identified for momenta down to 0.2 gev / c and for polar angles between 8@xmath55 and 142@xmath55 .",
    "the clas superconducting coils reduce the acceptance of about 80% at @xmath56 to about 50% at forward angles ( @xmath57 ) , while the total acceptance for electrons is about 1.5 sr .",
    "electron momentum resolution is a function of the scattered electron angle and it varies from 0.5% for @xmath58 up to 1 - 2% for @xmath59 .",
    "the angular resolution is approximately constant and approaching 1 mrad for polar and 4 mrad for azimuthal angles : the resolution on the momentum transfer ranges therefore from 0.2 up to 0.5 % .",
    "the missing mass resolution was estimated 2.5 mev for beam energy less than 3 gev and about 7 mev for larger energies . to study all possible multi - particle production ,",
    "the acquisition trigger was configured to require at least one electron candidate in any of the sectors , where an electron candidate was defined as the coincidence of a signal in the ec and cherenkov modules for each sector separately .",
    "the accumulated statistics at the five energies is large enough ( @xmath60 triggers ) to allow the extraction of the inclusive cross section with a rather small statistical error ( @xmath61% ) , in small @xmath4 and @xmath1 bins ( @xmath62 , @xmath63 gev@xmath3 ) .",
    "the determination of the systematic error was more critical .",
    "clas is a large acceptance spectrometer and the response depends on the energy @xmath64 and the angle @xmath65 of the scattered electron . determining the systematic effects of these , and other experimental parameters , is both necessary and complex .",
    "consequently , we dedicate the next subsections to the discussion of the analysis procedure .      determining the momentum of a charged particle measured with clas depends on a proper understanding of the magnetic field geometry . due to the complexity of the detector and particularly the torus magnet system , it is crucial to check the reliability of the momentum determined by the dc tracking system . for this reason",
    "the position of the elastic peak was extracted from the measured inclusive electron cross section and compared to the theoretical value . a correction to the scattered electron momentum",
    "was applied to shift the elastic peak to the accepted value .",
    "the momentum correction obtained was small ( from 2 to 7 mev in @xmath66 , depending on the beam energy ) and resulted in significant improvement in the width of elastic peak .",
    "the systematic error on the correction was estimated by comparing the position of the well known second resonance ( @xmath67 ) to the position given in ref .",

    "the present data set covers a large interval in @xmath4 thus reducing the uncertainties in the integration procedure .",
    "the nachtmann moments obtained in this work have been analyzed in terms of a twist expansion in order to simultaneously extract both the leading and the higher twists .",
    "the former has not been treated at fixed order in perturbation theory , but higher - order corrections of pqcd were taken into account by means of soft gluon resummation techniques .",
    "higher twists have been treated phenomenologically by introducing _",
    "effective _ anomalous dimensions .",
    "the range of the analysis was quite large , ranging from @xmath174 to @xmath175  ( gev / c)@xmath3 .",
    "the leading twist is determined with a few percent uncertainty , while the precision of the higher twists increases with @xmath17 reaching an overall @xmath176% for @xmath177 and @xmath178 , thanks to the remarkable quality of the experimental moments .",
    "the main results of our twist analysis can be summarized as follows :   i ) the contribution of the leading twist calculated in the frame of pqcd at nlo remains dominant down to @xmath179 ( gev / c)@xmath3 , where @xmath17 is the moment order .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that a pqcd - based description of the proton structure is relevant also at low @xmath1 , with significant but not crucial corrections ;   ii ) the total contribution of the multi - parton correlation effects is not negligible for @xmath180  ( gev / c)@xmath3 and large @xmath4 corresponding to the resonance region .",
    "this can be seen by comparing the higher twist contribution to @xmath168 , which is more heavily weighted in @xmath4 , to @xmath165 ;   iii ) different higher twist terms tend to compensate each other in such a way that their sum is small even in a @xmath1 region where their absolute contributions exceed the leading twist .",
    "this cancellation is responsible for the duality phenomena and leads to the prevailing dis - inspired picture of photon - proton collisions at low @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , we demonstrated that a precise determination of higher twists is feasible with the high quality of the new clas data .",
    "the main limitation of the present analysis is the use of a phenomenological ansatz for the higher twists . in this respect",

    "<S> we measured the inclusive electron - proton cross section in the nucleon resonance region ( @xmath0  gev ) at momentum transfers @xmath1 below @xmath2  ( gev / c)@xmath3 with the clas detector . </S>",
    "<S> the large acceptance of clas allowed the measurement of the cross section in a large , contiguous two - dimensional range of @xmath1 and @xmath4 , making it possible to perform an integration of the data at fixed @xmath1 over the significant @xmath4-interval . from these data we extracted the structure function @xmath5 and , by including other world data </S>",
    "<S> , we studied the @xmath1 evolution of its moments , @xmath6 , in order to estimate higher twist contributions . </S>",
    "<S> the small statistical and systematic uncertainties of the clas data allow a precise extraction of the higher twists and will require significant improvements in theoretical predictions if a meaningful comparison with these new experimental results is to be made . </S>"
