    "over the past few years the dominant explanation for the large mass to light ratios inferred for galactic and meta - galactic systems , that these are embedded within massive dark matter halos , has begun to be challenged .",
    "direct detection of the dark matter particles , in spite of decades of extensive and dedicated searches , remains lacking .",
    "this has led some to interpret the velocity dispersion measurements of stars in the local dsph galaxies ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) , the extended and flat rotation curves of spiral galaxies ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) , the large velocity dispersions of galaxies in clusters ( e.g. @xcite ) , stellar dynamics in elliptical galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) , the gravitational lensing due to massive galaxies ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) , and even the cosmologically inferred matter content for the universe through cmb and structure formation physics ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , not as indirect evidence for the existence of a dominant dark matter component , but as direct evidence for the failure of the current newtonian and general relativistic theories of gravity , in the large scale or low acceleration regimes relevant for the above situations .",
    "numerous alternative theories of gravity have recently appeared ( e.g. teves of @xcite , and variations ; @xcite , @xcite , f(r ) theories e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , conformal gravity theories e.g. @xcite ) , mostly grounded on geometrical extensions to general relativity , and leading to laws of gravity which in the large scale or low acceleration regime , mimic the modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) fitting formulas .",
    "similarly , @xcite have explored mond not as a modification to newton s second law , but as a modified gravitational force law in the newtonian regime , finding a good agreement with observed dynamics across galactic scales without requiring dark matter .",
    "in fact , recently @xcite have constructed an @xmath5 extension to general relativity which in the low velocity limit converges to the above approach .    whilst classical gravity augmented by the dark matter hypothesis provides a coherent and unified interpretation from galactic to cosmological scales ( with the inclusion of dark energy ) , the very profusion of modified gravity theories , mostly tested in very localised situations , points to the lack of any definitive theoretical contender to classical gravity .",
    "nonetheless , a generic feature of all of the modified gravity schemes mentioned above is the appearance of an acceleration scale , @xmath2 , above which classical gravity is recovered , and below which the dark matter mimicking regime appears .",
    "this last feature results in a general prediction ; all systems where @xmath6 should appear as devoid of dark matter , and all systems where @xmath7 should appear as dark matter dominated , when interpreted under classical gravity .",
    "it is interesting that no @xmath6 system has ever been detected where dark matter needs to be invoked , in accordance with the former condition . on the other hand",
    ", the latter condition furnishes a testable prediction , in relation to the orbits of wide binaries . for test particles in orbit around a @xmath1 star , in circular orbits of radius @xmath8",
    ", the acceleration is expected to drop below @xmath9 for @xmath107000 au@xmath11 .",
    "the above provides a test for the dark matter/ modified theories of gravity debate ; the relative velocities of components of binary stars with large physical separations should deviate from kepler s third law under the latter interpretation .",
    "more specifically , seen as an equivalent newtonian force law , beyond @xmath127000 au the gravitational force should gradually switch from the classical form of @xmath13 to @xmath14 , and hence the orbital velocity , @xmath15 , should no longer decrease with separation , but settle at a constant value , dependent only on the total mass of the system through @xmath16 .",
    "that is , under modified gravity theories , binary stars with physical separations beyond around 7000 au should exhibit `` flat rotation curves '' and a `` tully - fisher relation '' , as galactic systems in the same acceleration regime do .    an interesting precedent in this sense",
    "is given by the recent results of @xcite and @xcite who find evidence for a transition in the dynamics of stars in the outer regions of a series of galactic globular clusters .",
    "these authors report a flattening of the velocity dispersion profile in globular clusters , outwards of the radius where accelerations fall below the @xmath2 threshold , in accordance with generic predictions of modified gravity schemes .",
    "the interpretation under newtonian dynamics explains the observed flattening as due to tidal heating by the milky way , e.g @xcite , but the matter is still being debated .",
    "we also note the recent results of @xcite who point out various discrepancies between standard @xmath17 predictions and structural and dynamical properties of the local group , and suggest solutions to these in the context of modified gravity theories .",
    "in this paper we propose that wide binary orbits may be used to test newtonian gravity in the low acceleration regime .",
    "we apply this test to the binaries of two very recent catalogues containing relative velocities and separations of wide binaries .",
    "the two catalogues are entirely independent in their approaches . the first one , @xcite uses data from the _ hipparcos _ satellite to yield a moderate number of systems ( 280 ) relatively devoid of false positives ( 10% ) , with a high average signal to noise ratio for the relative velocities of the binaries ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "the second , @xcite identifies 1,250 wide binaries from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data base data release 7 , which , compounded with a detailed galactic stellar distribution model , results in pairs with a very low probability of chance alignment ( @xmath19 ) , albeit with a low average signal to noise ratio in their relative velocities ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : section ( 2 ) briefly gives the expectations for the distribution of relative velocities as a function of separation for wide binaries , under both newtonian gravity and generically for modified theories of gravity . in section ( 3 ) we show the results of applying the test to the @xcite _ hipparcos _ catalogue , and to the independent @xcite sdss data .",
    "our conclusions are summarised in section ( 4 ) .",
    "since orbital periods for @xmath1 binaries with separations in the tens of au range already extend into the centuries , there is no hope of testing the prediction we are interested in through direct orbital mapping .",
    "fortunately , modern relative proper motion studies do reach binary separations upwards of @xmath3 au , e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the newtonian prediction for the relative velocities of the two components of binaries having circular orbits , when plotted against the binary physical separation , @xmath8 , is for a scaling of @xmath21 , essentially following kepler s third law , provided the range of masses involved were narrow .    in a relative proper motion sample",
    "however , only two components of the relative velocity appear , as velocity along the line of sight to the binary leads to no proper motion .",
    "thus , orbital projection plays a part , with systems having orbital planes along the line of sight sometimes appearing as having no relative proper motions .",
    "a further effect comes from any degree of orbital ellipticity present ; it is hence clear that the trend for @xmath21 described above , will only provide an upper limit to the distribution of projected @xmath22 vs. @xmath8 expected in any real observed sample , even if only a narrow range of masses is included .",
    "one should expect a range of measured values of projected @xmath22 at a fixed observed projected @xmath8 , all extending below the newtonian limit , which for equal mass binaries in circular orbits gives :    @xmath23    the problem is complicated further by the dynamical evolution of any population of binaries in the galactic environment . over time",
    ", the orbital parameters of wide binaries will evolve due to the effects of galactic tidal forces .",
    "also , dynamical encounters with other stars in the field will modify the range of separations and relative velocities , specially in the case of wide binaries .",
    "to first order , one would expect little evolution for binaries tighter than the tidal limit of the problem , and the eventual dissolution of wider systems .",
    "a very detailed study of all these points has recently appeared , @xcite .",
    "these authors numerically follow populations of 50,000 @xmath1 binaries in the galactic environment , accounting for the evolution of the orbital parameters of each due to the cumulative effects of the galactic tidal field at the solar radius . also , the effects of close and long range encounters with other stars in the field are carefully included , to yield a present day distribution of separations and relative velocities for an extensive population of wide binaries , under newtonian gravity . interestingly , one of the main findings is that although little evolution occurs for separations below the effective tidal radius of the problem , calculated to be of 1.7 pc , the situation for grater separations is much more complex than the simple disappearance of such pairs .",
    "it is found that when many wide binaries cross their jacobi radius , the two components remain fairly close by in both coordinate and velocity space , drifting in the galactic potential along very similar orbits .",
    "this means that in any real wide binary search a number of wide pairs with separations larger than their jacobi radii will appear .",
    "finally , @xcite obtain the rms one - dimensional relative velocity difference , @xmath24 , projected along an arbitrary line of sight , for the entire populations of binaries dynamically evolved over 10 gyr to today , for a distribution of initial ellipticities , as plotted against the projected separation on the sky for each pair .",
    "the expected keplerian fall of @xmath25 for separations below 1.7 pc is obtained , followed by a slight rise in @xmath24 as wide systems cross the jacobi radius threshold .",
    "@xmath24 then settles at rms values of @xmath26 .",
    "these authors also explore variation in the initial ( realistic ) distribution of semi - major axes , and the formation history of the binaries , finding slight differences in the results , which however are quite robust to all the variations in the parameters explored , in the regime we are interested of present day projected separations larger than @xmath27 , above very small variations of less than 0.14 in the logarithm .",
    "this represents the best currently available estimate of how relative velocities should scale with projected separations for binary stars ( both bound and in the process of dissolving in the galactic tides ) under newtonian gravity .",
    "the testable quantitative prediction of classical gravity for the distribution of data in a plot of projected @xmath22 vs. projected @xmath8 is clear : one should find a spread of points extending below the limit defined by eq.(1 ) , with an rms value for @xmath24 given by the results of @xcite , their figure ( 7 ) .",
    "the recent proliferation of modified gravity models however , implies the absence of a definitive alternative to classical gravity .",
    "further , in many cases , the complex formulations put forth do not lend themselves to straightforward manipulations from which detailed predictions might be extracted for varied applications distinct from the particular problems under which such models are presented .",
    "we shall therefore not attempt to test any particular modified gravity theory , but shall only consider the generic predictions such theories make for `` flat rotation curves '' in the @xmath0 regime .",
    "that is , the predictions of modified gravity schemes will only be considered qualitatively and generically , to first order , in terms of the upper envelope of observed distributions in projected @xmath22 vs. @xmath8 plots to appear flat . for circular orbits",
    "one expects :    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is a model - dependent constant expected to be of order unity .",
    "a further correction upwards due to departures from circularity , which at this point must be thought of as dependent on the details of the particular modified gravity scheme one might pick , should also be included .",
    "this correction will tend to give even larger values of @xmath30 .",
    "we note that in the particular case of mond , the external field effect , the fact that the overall potential of the galaxy at the solar neighbourhood globally puts local binaries close to the @xmath31 threshold , would imply only slight corrections om newtonian predictions .",
    "we see that all we need is a large sample of relative proper motion and binary separation measurements to test the newtonian prediction for the rms values of the 1 dimensional relative velocities of @xcite , and to contrast the @xmath32 and the @xmath33 predictions for the upper envelope of the @xmath22 vs. @xmath8 distributions .",
    "it is important to have a sample as free of chance alignments as possible , as the inclusion of non - physical stellar pairs would blur the test , potentially making a conclusion suspect .",
    "also , it is desirable to limit the range of masses of the stars involved , as a spread in mass will also blur any trends expected for the upper limit of the @xmath22 distributions , although not terribly so , given the small powers to which mass appears in both predictions .    to end this section we briefly recall the first order tidal limit calculation of    @xmath34    which leads to the tidal density stability condition of @xmath35 for the density of a satellite of extent @xmath36 and mass @xmath37 orbiting at a distance @xmath38 from the centre of a spherical mass distribution @xmath39 having an average matter density @xmath40 internal to @xmath38 resulting in a gravitational force @xmath41 , under the assumption @xmath42 .",
    "the equivalent calculation under the force law given by the @xmath7 limit of @xmath43 is given by :    @xmath44    leading to :    @xmath45    as the equivalent of the classical tidal density criterion , as a first generic approximation under modified gravity .",
    "since the spatial extent of wide binaries will always be much smaller that their galactocentric radii , equation ( 5 ) shows that under modified gravity , to first order , wide binaries will be much more robust to tides than under newtonian gravity . in the following section we apply the test we have identified to two recent catalogues of wide binaries which became available over the previous year , the slowpokes catalogue of sdss wide binaries by @xcite and the _ hipparcos _ satellite wide binaries catalogue of @xcite",
    "the average value for the signal to noise ratio for the sample shown is 1.7 .",
    "the upper limit shows the flat trend expected from modified gravity theories , at odds with kepler s third law , shown by the @xmath46 solid line . ]    the @xcite catalogue of very wide binaries was constructed through a full bayesian analysis of the combined _ hipparcos _ database , the new reduction of the _ hipparcos _ catalogue , @xcite , the tycho-2 catalogue , @xcite and the _ tycho _ double star catalogue , @xcite mostly , amongst others .",
    "there , probable wide binaries are identified by assigning a probability above chance alignment to the stars analysed by carefully comparing to the underlying background ( and its variations ) in a 5 dimensional parameter space of proper motions and spatial positions .",
    "the authors have taken care to account for the distortions introduced by the spherical projection on the relative proper motion measurements , @xmath47 .",
    "when angular separations cease to be small , small relative physical velocities between an associated pair of stars might result in large values of @xmath47 .",
    "a correction of this effect is introduced , to keep @xmath47 values comparable across the whole binary separation range studied .",
    "we have taken this catalogue and kept only binaries with a probability of non - chance alignment greater than @xmath48 .",
    "the wide binary search criteria used by the authors requires that the proposed binary should have no near neighbours ; the projected separation between the two components is thus always many times smaller than the typical interstellar separation , see @xcite .",
    "we use the reported distances to the primaries , where errors are smallest , to calculate projected @xmath22 and projected @xmath8 from the measured @xmath47 and @xmath49 values reported by @xcite .",
    "although the use of _ hipparcos _ measurements guarantees the best available quality in the data , we have also further pruned the catalogue to remove all binaries for which the final signal to noise ratio in the relative velocities on the plane of the sky was lower than @xmath50 .",
    "we plot in figure ( 1 ) a sample of 280 binaries constructed as described above , having distances to the sun within @xmath51 in pc .",
    "the slanted line gives the newtonian prediction of eq.(1 ) to the upper limit expected on the relative velocities shown , which appears in conflict with it , as they are defined by a neat horizontal upper limit , as generically predicted by modified gravity theories , eq.(2 ) .",
    "figure ( 1 ) could then be a first direct evidence of the breakdown of classical gravity theories in the low acceleration regime of @xmath0 .",
    "the average signal to noise ratio for the data in figure ( 2 ) is 1.7 , with an average error on @xmath22 of 0.83 @xmath52 , which considering a @xmath53 factor from the top of the distribution to the real underlying upper limit for the sample , results in 3 @xmath52 as our estimate of the actual physical upper limit in @xmath22 . comparing with eq.(2 ) , the factor accounting for non - circular orbits in modified gravity comes to 4.5 . that this factor is significantly larger than the @xmath54 of newtonian gravity is to be expected , as objects are much more tightly bound in mond - type schemes .    ) .",
    "the average value for the signal to noise ratio for the sample shown is 0.5 .",
    "the upper limit shows the flat trend expected from modified gravity theories , at odds with kepler s third law , shown by the @xmath46 solid line . ]",
    "values below the newtonian upper limit prediction of eq .",
    "( 1 ) , as a fraction of the total per bin , for the sdss data of @xcite , as a function of projected binary separations . ]",
    "the sloan low mass wide pairs catalogue ( slowpokes ) of @xcite contains a little over 1,200 wide binaries with relative proper motions for each pair , distances and angular separations .",
    "also , extreme care was taken to include only physical binaries , with a full galactic population model used to exclude chance alignment stars using galactic coordinates and galactic velocities , resulting in an estimate of fewer than 2% of false positives .",
    "as with the _ hipparcos _ sample , this last requirement yields only isolated binaries with no neighbours within many times the internal binary separation .",
    "we have also excluded all systems with white dwarfs or subdwarf primaries , where distance calibrations are somewhat uncertain . as was also done for the _ hipparcos _ sample , all triple systems reported in the catalogue",
    "were completely excluded from the analysis .    given the large range of distances to the sdss binaries ( @xmath55 ) ,",
    "we select only 1/3 of the sample lying within the narrow distance range ( @xmath56 ) , which forms the most homogeneous set in terms of the errors in @xmath22 , excluding data with large errors at large distances .",
    "again , we use the reported distances to the primaries , where errors are smallest , to calculate projected @xmath22 and projected @xmath8 from the measured @xmath47 , @xmath49 and @xmath57 values reported by @xcite , to plot figure ( 2 ) .",
    "the figure shows 417 binaries with average signal to noise ratio and average errors on @xmath22 of 0.5 and 11.3 @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "the slanted solid line gives the newtonian prediction of eq.(1 ) .",
    "it is clear that the upper envelope of the distribution of @xmath22 measurements from the catalogue does not comply with kepler s third law .",
    "as was the case with the _ hipparcos _ sample , the upper envelope of the distribution of observed measurements describes a flat line , as expected under modified gravity schemes .",
    "figure ( 3 ) is a plot of the number of slowpokes systems for the full distance range , with @xmath22 values below the newtonian prediction of eq.(1 ) , and hence consistent with it , as a fraction of the total per bin , as a function of projected binary separations .",
    "we see this fraction starts off being consistent with 1 , but begins to decrease on approaching @xmath58 , after which point it rapidly drops , to end up consistent with 0 on reaching separations of around @xmath59 .",
    "again , the result matches the qualitative generic expectations of modified gravity schemes , but would call for further explanations under classical gravity .    the average signal to noise values in @xmath22 for the full distance range of the @xcite catalogue",
    "the average error on @xmath22 for the full sdss sample is 12 @xmath52 , which considering a @xmath53 factor from the top of the complete distribution to the real underlying upper limit , results in the same @xmath60 as obtained for the @xcite _ hipparcos _ catalogue .",
    "intervals being from the _ hipparcos _ sample of @xcite , and those two with wide @xmath61 intervals coming from the sdss sample of @xcite . ]",
    "we end this section with figure ( 4 ) , where we calculate the rms value of the one - dimensional relative velocity difference for both of the samples discussed , after binning the data into constant logarithmic intervals in @xmath8 .",
    "this quantity is given by the points , where the error bars simply show the propagation of the errors on @xmath47 and @xmath57 , reported by the authors of the catalogues .",
    "we construct @xmath24 by considering only one coordinate of the two available from the relative motion on the plane of the sky .",
    "thus , each binary can furnish two @xmath24 measurements , which statistically should not introduce any bias . indeed , using only @xmath62 or only @xmath63 or both for each binary , yields the same mean values for the points shown .",
    "the small solid error bars result from considering an enlarged sample where each binary contributes two @xmath64 measurements , while the larger dotted ones come from considering each binary only once , and do not change if we consider only @xmath62 or only @xmath63 .",
    "the series of small @xmath61 interval data are for the _ hipparcos _ catalogue of @xcite , while the two broader crosses show results for the @xcite sdss sample of figure ( 2 ) . for this last case ,",
    "the much larger intrinsic errors mean that to compensate through weight of numbers the low signal to noise ratio of this catalogue , imposes the loss of separation resolution through the use of only two bins , with vertical error bars which are only relevant if the sample is doubled , as described above .",
    "the solid curve is the newtonian prediction of the full galactic evolutionary model of @xcite for a randomly oriented population of wide binaries with a realistic distribution of eccentricities , both bound and in the process of dissolving .",
    "note that the results of this simulation deviate from kepler s law for s larger than the newtonian jacobi radius of the problem of @xmath65 , whereas the deviation shown by the samples of binaries studied also occur at much smaller separations ( see below ) . even considering the large error bars , where each binary contributes only one @xmath24 value , we see eight points lying beyond 1@xmath66 , making the probability of consistency between this prediction and the observations of less than @xmath67=@xmath68 .",
    "the only point where this model is slightly at odds with the selection of the _ hipparcos _ sample of @xcite , is that @xcite assume @xmath1 stars for their binaries , while the typical mass of the stars in the binaries we examine is closer to @xmath69 .",
    "this detail would only shift the newtonian prediction a factor of @xmath70 further away from the measurements .",
    "we obtain an rms value for @xmath24 compatible with a horizontal line at 1 @xmath52 , in qualitative agreement with expectations from modified gravity schemes .",
    "the vertical dashed line marks the @xmath31 threshold ; we clearly see the data departing from the newtonian prediction outwards of this line , and not before .",
    "under newtonian gravity one would need to look for an alternative dynamical dissociation and heating mechanism for the binaries we analyse which might result in relative velocities an order of magnitude above the results obtained by @xcite .",
    "the _ hipparcos _",
    "catalogue has been closely studied for over a decade , and not only the values reported , but also the uncertainties in them are now well established .",
    "it is highly unlikely that these confidence intervals might have been systematically underestimated by the community by a factor of 3 , as would be required for the data in fig.(4 ) to be consistent with the newtonian prediction of @xcite .",
    "the two sdss points are clearly consistent with the _ hipparcos _ measurements , but given the much larger error bars , they are also marginally consistent with the newtonian prediction at a 2@xmath66 level . a fuller discussion of the robustness of our results to the various sample selection effects and errors involved appears in the appendix .",
    "the consistency of the results obtained from both catalogues provides a check of the physical reality of the trends presented .",
    "the two completely independent , very carefully constructed catalogues , each using different sets of selection criteria , each perhaps subject to its own independent systematics , are consistent with the same result , a constant horizontal upper envelope for the distribution of relative velocities on the plane of the sky at an intrinsic value of 3 @xmath711 @xmath52 , extending over 3 orders of magnitude in @xmath8 , with a constant rms @xmath24 value consistent with 1 @xmath710.5 @xmath52 .",
    "this supports the interpretation of the effect detected as the generic prediction of modified gravity theories .",
    "given the relevance of the subject matter discussed , it would be highly desirable to obtain an independent confirmation , ideally using a purposely designed sample including cuts at a variety of stellar masses , in order to test the scaling of the fourth power of the dynamical velocities with mass expected under modified gravity schemes . to include also radial velocity measurements",
    "would require sampling over many epochs , as the only way to allow for the effects of nearby companions in these frequently hierarchical systems .",
    "we have identified a critical test in the classical gravity/ modified gravity debate , using the relative velocities of wide binaries with separations in excess of 7000 au , as these occupy the @xmath0 regime characteristic of modified gravity models .",
    "we present a first application of this critical test using the best currently available data ; a large sample of wide binaries from the sdss with low signal to noise on the relative velocities , and a smaller _ hipparcos _ satellite sample with signal to noise @xmath18 on the relative velocities of the binaries sampled .",
    "results show constant relative rms velocities for the binary stars in question , irrespective of their separation , in the @xmath72 regime sampled .",
    "this is quantitatively inconsistent with detailed predictions of newtonian dynamical models for large populations of binaries evolving in the local galactic environment .",
    "our results are qualitatively in accordance with generic modified gravity models constructed to explain galactic dynamics in the absence of dark matter , where one expects constant relative velocities for binary stars , irrespective of their separation , in the @xmath0 regime sampled .",
    "the authors wish to thank arcadio poveda and pavel kroupa for insightful discussions on the subject treated here .",
    "alejandra jimenez acknowledges financial support from a conacyt scholarship .",
    "xavier hernandez acknowledges financial support from unam- dgapa grant in103011 .",
    "we begin this section with a discussion of various analyses performed to test for the possibility that our results could have been driven by potential systematics and selection effects in the catalogues .",
    "we first test for the option that the results of figures ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) were distorted from the newtonian prediction by errors which correlate with the separation of the binaries , increasing as the separation increases , to yield the trends obtained .",
    "for the _ hipparcos _ sample we ranked the binaries by separation , @xmath8 , and calculated the average errors on the resulting @xmath22 in each the tightest third , middle third and widest third of the binaries , yielding values 0.8 ( 0.4 ) , 0.7 ( 0.11 ) and 1.0 ( 0.4 ) respectively , in @xmath52 . the numbers in parenthesis giving the dispersion of the distributions of errors in each of the three thirds of the sample .",
    "it can be seen that there is no increase either in the average values of the errors in @xmath22 , or in the width of the distributions of errors , with increasing binary separations . for the sdss sample",
    "the average errors in @xmath22 show only a very slight increase of a factor of 1.3 over the entire range probed .",
    "thus , for both samples , the trends of figures ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and ( 4 ) can not be explained as arising from the newtonian prediction and an increase in the errors with binary separation .",
    "in essence , the data presented are inconsistent with the newtonian prediction not because of differences in the details of the trends , but because the former presents multiple real detections at a level of @xmath73 , while the latter is smaller by an order of magnitude .",
    "the resulting rms values for the various data points are of @xmath74 , while the newtonian prediction lies below the detection by about a factor of 10 .",
    "we next check against systematics in the catalogues , which would preferentially arise in the lower signal to noise points , or alternatively , in the most distant ones . for the _ hipparcos _ sample , we repeat the experiment including only points with a signal to noise ratio on @xmath75 , and then including only the binaries nearest to earth with @xmath76 .",
    "these two sub- samples have 186 and 130 binaries , with average signal to noise ratios on @xmath22 above the value of 1.7 of figure ( 1 ) , of 2 and 2.2 respectively , and yield results indistinguishable from figs . ( 1 ) and ( 4 ) .",
    "also , we checked explicitly the results of the sdss sample for any systematics with distance to the binaries analysed , and found the flat upper envelope to be robust to the choice of distance range taken .",
    "although no specific cut in resulting @xmath22 or even on measured @xmath47 was built into the _ hipparcos _",
    "catalogue , the sdss one includes the selection cut that the signal to noise ratio on @xmath47 should be @xmath77 .",
    "we repeat the sdss analysis tracing the 15% of the points closest to this cut , and find that these , the ones which just made the cut , do not define the flat upper envelope on @xmath22 . for both",
    "the _ hipparcos _ and the sdss samples , any observational bias / truncation would appear in ( @xmath47 , @xmath49 ) space , not in the ( @xmath22 , @xmath8 ) one .",
    "we end with a detailed description of the calculation of the points in figure ( 4 ) and their error bars , directly from the data published in the catalogues used . whenever @xmath78 , the error in @xmath79 is given by @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the error in @xmath82 .",
    "if @xmath79 is a function of several variables @xmath83 , the absolute error , which we take , is @xmath84 which is always greater than standard deviation @xmath85 .    following these rules we estimate the absolute error in each @xmath22 measurement , and in the rms velocity for the samples studied .",
    "for the _ hipparcos _ sample we have taken columns 11,12,13 and 14 of the online catalogue of @xcite , which contains the values of the relative motions of each binary and their errors , as well as columns 15 and 16 , which contain the distance to the binary , @xmath57 , and its corresponding error , @xmath86 .",
    "we then binned the data into constant logarithmic intervals in @xmath8 with a width of 0.32 and calculated @xmath93 for each bin , @xmath94 the number of binary systems that fall into each bin .",
    "the error in @xmath93 for each bin is now :      to compare with the prediction of the rms values for the one dimensional projected relative velocities of the evolutionary model of @xcite we construct @xmath93 by considering only one coordinate . for the case of the sdss sample of @xcite , we have calculated the relative proper motion for each coordinate @xmath96 and @xmath97 taking columns 18 to 25 of their online catalogue , which contain the proper motions and their errors in equatorial coordinates for each component of the binary system , to estimate the projected relative velocity we have used column 26 containing the distance to the primary , in this case we consider an error of @xmath98 in the distance and we have followed the same path as in the previous case for calculating the rms relative velocities and their errors ."

    "<S> modified gravity scenarios where a change of regime appears at acceleration scales @xmath0 have been proposed . since for @xmath1 systems the acceleration drops below @xmath2 at scales of around 7000 au , a statistical survey of wide binaries with relative velocities and separations reaching @xmath3 au and beyond should prove useful to the above debate . </S>",
    "<S> we apply the proposed test to the best currently available data . </S>",
    "<S> results show a constant upper limit to the relative velocities in wide binaries which is independent of separation for over three orders of magnitude , in analogy with galactic flat rotation curves in the same @xmath0 acceleration regime . </S>",
    "<S> our results are suggestive of a breakdown of kepler s third law beyond @xmath4 scales , in accordance with generic predictions of modified gravity theories designed not to require any dark matter at galactic scales and beyond . </S>"
