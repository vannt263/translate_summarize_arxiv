    "the origin of large - scale cosmic magnetic fields remains a challenging problem .",
    "it is widely assumed that magnetic fields in astronomical objects , like galaxies , grew by turbulent dynamo action on small seed magnetic fields ( cf .",
    "ruzmaikin , shukurov & sokoloff 1988 ; beck et al 1996 ) . however , the efficiency of turbulent galactic dynamos is still unclear , especially in view of the constraints implied by helicity conservation ( cattaneo & vainshtein 1991 ; kulsrud & anderson 1992 ; gruzinov & diamond 1994 ; cattaneo & hughes 1996;subramanian 1998 , 1999 ; blackman & field 2000 ; kleoorin et al 2000 ; brandenburg 2001 ; brandenburg and subramanian 2000 ; brandenburg , dobler and subramanian 2002 )",
    ". magnetic fields with larger coherence scales may also be present in clusters of galaxies ( clarke , kronberg & bohringer 2001 ) and at high redshifts ( oren & wolfe 1995 ) .",
    "it is not yet clear that all these large - scale coherent fields could result from dynamo action . alternatively ,",
    "galactic or cluster fields could be remnants of a primordial cosmological magnetic field ( cf .",
    "kulsrud 1990 ; 1999 ) , although , as yet , there is no entirely compelling mechanism for producing the required field",
    ". it could be present in the initial conditions , be produced quantum gravitationally or at a phase transition , or be generated in some way at the end of a period of inflation , perhaps with an almost scale - invariant spectrum ( turner & widrow 1988 ; ratra 1992 ; cf . grasso and rubenstein 2001 for a review ) .    a primordial field that expanded to contribute a present field strength of order @xmath6 gauss , tangled on galactic scales , could also affect the process of galaxy formation ( rees & reinhardt 1972 ; wasserman 1978 ; kim , olinto & rosner 1996 ; subramanian & barrow 1998a , sb98 hereafter ) .",
    "it is of considerable interest , therefore , to find different ways of limiting or detecting such primordial fields ( see kronberg 1994 and grasso & rubenstein 2001 for reviews ) . here , we will show that the imminent extension of cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) observations to very small angular scales allows us to test for the presence of dynamically significant cosmological magnetic fields in new ways .",
    "this is because tangled magnetic fields create small - scale power in cmbr temperature anisotropy that would have been damped out if magnetic fields were absent .",
    "conversely , if enhanced power is found in the cmbr power spectrum on very small scales then it might be explained by the effects of tangled magnetic fields .    in an earlier paper ( subramanian & barrow 1998b , hereafter paper i )",
    ", we argued that observations of anisotropies in the cmbr provide a potentially powerful constraint on such tangled magnetic fields .",
    "indeed , the isotropy of the cmbr already places a limit of @xmath7 gauss on the present strength of any _ uniform _ ( spatially homogeneous ) component of the magnetic field ( barrow , ferreira & silk 1997 ) , where @xmath8 is the present matter density parameter , and @xmath9 the hubble constant in units of @xmath10 km s@xmath11 mpc@xmath11 ) . in paper",
    "i we obtained comparable constraints on tangled ( inhomogeneous ) magnetic fields and highlighted the distinctive fluctuation signature that they are expected to leave in the small - scale structure of the cmbr . in particular , tangled magnetic fields produce vortical perturbations , which are overdamped in the radiation era .",
    "these can then survive silk damping ( silk 1968 ) on scales much smaller than the compressional modes ( jedamzik , katalinic & olinto 1998 ; sb98 ) , so an obvious place to expect signals induced by tangled magnetic fields is below the silk damping scale , or at multipoles of greater than @xmath12 .",
    "several new and ongoing experiments ( map , vsa , acbar , cbi , atca and planck surveyor ) are indeed expected to provide information in this large @xmath1 regime .",
    "this motivates us to revisit the computation of the expected signals at larger values of @xmath1 , for a wider variety of cosmological parameters and spectral indices , than were made in paper i. in particular , we calculate results for a new high-@xmath1 regime , where the photon mean - free path exceeds the scale of the perturbation .",
    "these predictions will allow comparison with future observations .",
    "the evolution of temperature anisotropy for vector perturbations has been derived in detail by hu and white ( 1997a ) in the total angular momentum representation and was also given in paper i. the temperature anisotropy is expanded in terms of tensor spherical harmonics and the angular power spectrum induced by vector perturbations is given by ( see paper i and mack , kahniashvilli and kosowsky 2002 ) , @xmath13 here , @xmath14 is the magnitude of the vorticity , @xmath15 , in fourier space , where @xmath16 is the rotational component of the fluid velocity , and @xmath17 is the vector metric perturbation .",
    "note that since @xmath18 also appears in the euler equation for baryons , we need never compute the vector metric perturbation explicitly ( see also mack , kahniashvilli and kosowsky 2002 ) .",
    "also , @xmath19 is the co - moving wave number , @xmath20 is conformal time , @xmath21 its present value , and @xmath22 is the spherical bessel function of order @xmath1 . we have ignored a small polarization correction to the source term and also a metric perturbation term which is subdominant at large @xmath1 ( cf .",
    "seshadri and subramanian 2001 ) .",
    "the visibility function , @xmath23 determines the probability that a photon reaches us at epoch @xmath21 if it was last scattered at the epoch @xmath20 .",
    "we adopt a flat universe throughout , with a total matter density @xmath8 and a non - zero cosmological constant density @xmath24 today .    in paper i we obtained analytic estimates for @xmath25 in various asymptotic regimes .",
    "we briefly recapitulate the arguments and results .",
    "firstly , we approximated the visibility function as a gaussian : @xmath26 $ ] , where @xmath27 is the conformal epoch of `` last scattering '' and @xmath28 measures the width of the lss . to estimate these",
    ", we use the expressions given in hu and sugiyama ( 1995 ) , adopting a baryon density parameter @xmath29 , and @xmath30 .",
    "we estimate the epoch of last scattering , to be @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "to convert redshift into conformal time we use @xmath33 , valid for a flat universe ( cf .",

    "we get @xmath37 mpc , and @xmath38 mpc , while for a @xmath39-dominated model with @xmath40 , we get @xmath41 mpc and @xmath42 mpc",
    ". we will use these numbers in the numerical estimates below .",

    "( [ deldef ] ) then come from a range @xmath28 around the epoch @xmath43 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath44 picks out @xmath45 values in the integrand which have @xmath46 thus , following the arguments detailed in paper i , for @xmath47 we get the analytical estimate , @xmath48 .",

    "we assume the magnetic field to be initially a gaussian random field . on galactic scales and above",
    ", the induced velocity is generally so small that it does not lead to any appreciable distortion of the initial field ( jedamzik , katalinic and olinto 1998 , sb98 ) .",

    "the comoving silk damping scale at recombination , @xmath72 mpc , separates scales on which the radiative viscosity is important ( @xmath73 ) from those on which it is negligible ( @xmath74 ) . for @xmath75 ,",
    "the damping due to the photon viscosity can be neglected compared to the lorentz force .",

    "this gives @xmath81 , on scales where diffusion damping operates .",
    "the transition silk scale can also be estimated by equating @xmath18 in the two cases , to give @xmath82^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "a new regime arises on very small scales that are well below the photon mean - free path .",
    "the radiative drag force is then no longer described by the diffusion approximation , but rather by the free - streaming drag given in eq .",

    "one can also estimate the transition scale , say @xmath86 , below which free - streaming damping dominates , by equating the induced velocities in the diffusion and free - streaming damping regimes , to get @xmath87 .    in order to compute the @xmath25s we also need to specify",
    "the spectrum of the tangled magnetic field , say @xmath88 .",

    "( [ smalt ] ) by @xmath125 .",
    "the cmbr anisotropy which results for scales so small that free - streaming damping dominates is @xmath126    the function @xmath127 in the eqs.([largt])-([versmalt ] ) is a dimensionless mode - coupling integral given by @xmath128 ,   \\label{modint}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath129 .",
    "in general , @xmath130 can only be evaluated numerically but for @xmath131 , where @xmath132 is the dirac delta function , it can be evaluated exactly .",
    "one gets , @xmath133^{1/2}$ ] , for @xmath134 , and zero for larger @xmath19 .",
    "so in this case , @xmath130 contributes a factor of order unity around @xmath135 , with @xmath136 .",
    "we can also find an analytic approximation to the mode coupling integral for power - law magnetic spectra .",
    "the approximation is different for @xmath137 , and for @xmath138 . for @xmath137 and for @xmath139 ( which is relevant for @xmath140 ) , one gets ( seshadri & subramanian 2001 ) : @xmath141 the mode - coupling integral is dominated by the small scale cut - off in this case . in the other limit @xmath138 , we find : @xmath142 for a nearly scale invariant spectrum , say with @xmath143 , we then get @xmath144 for scales larger than the silk scale , and @xmath145 , for scales smaller than @xmath146 but larger than @xmath147 .",
    "larger signals will be expected for steeper spectra , @xmath148 at the higher @xmath1 end .",
    "to complement these analytic results , we have also computed @xmath123 for the above spectra , by evaluating the @xmath20 and @xmath19 integrals in eq.([deldef ] ) numerically .",
    "we retain the analytic approximations to @xmath130 and @xmath149 with transitions between the limiting forms at wavenumbers @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "the results are displayed in figures 1 and 2 .",
    "we see that for @xmath152 , this leads to a predicted rms temperature anisotropy in the cmbr of order @xmath3 for @xmath153 , for a nearly scale - invariant power law spectra with @xmath143 .",
    "larger signals result , at the high @xmath1 end , for a @xmath39-dominated universe , compared to a matter dominated model ( compare the solid and dotted curves ) , basically due to an increase in @xmath154 for this model .",
    "larger signals also result for larger baryon density ( compare the solid and dashed - triple - dotted curves ) , due to the decrease in @xmath147 and hence the damping effects of radiative viscosity . also , a moderately steeper spectral index , with @xmath155 , which has more power on small scales leads to an increased @xmath156 ( compare the dashed - triple - dotted and dashed curves ) .",
    "much larger signals result from even steeper spectra , but we have not displayed these results , as spectra with @xmath157 and @xmath158 , are probably ruled out because of gravitational wave production , estimated by caprini and durrer ( 2002 )",
    ". they will also be significantly constrained by the high-@xmath1 limits on the anisotropy by atca , given in subrahmanyan et al ( 1998 ) .",
    "we find that our analytic approximation of the @xmath20 and @xmath19 integrals in eq.([deldef ] ) , tends to underestimate the amplitude of @xmath123 by about a factor @xmath159 , although the analytically predicted @xmath1-dependences agree very well with the numerical integration at both small and large @xmath1 . the numerical integration over the bessel function and the visibility functions are of course expected to be more accurate",
    ". the new regime of free - streaming damping is only seen at very large @xmath160 , which is of order @xmath161 even for the matter - dominated model , and is @xmath162 for the @xmath39-dominated model .",
    "( 240,240 )    ( 240,240 )",
    "we re - examined the expected small - angular scale anisotropy induced by tangled magnetic fields , for different cosmological parameters and spectral indices and including a new regime at very small scales .",
    "we are motivated primarily by several ongoing and future experiments , which probe this large- @xmath1 regime .",
    "tangled magnetic fields give a distinctive contribution to the high-@xmath1 signal , since they create vortical perturbations that survive silk damping on much smaller scales than do compressional modes .",
    "moreover , for small - scale rotational perturbations , the damping due to the finite thickness of the lss is also milder than for compressional modes .",
    "it should be emphasized that , by contrast , in the standard non - magnetic models the @xmath163 have a sharp cut off for @xmath164 , due to silk damping . as we see from figures 1 and 2 , it is precisely here that the magnetically induced signals begin to dominate .",
    "a scale - invariant spectrum of tangled fields which redshifts to a present value @xmath2 gauss , produces temperature anisotropies at the @xmath3 level between @xmath4 .",
    "larger signals are produced in a @xmath39-dominated universe , in a universe with larger baryon density , or if the spectral index of magnetic tangles is steeper , @xmath5 .",
    "note that the anisotropy in hot or cold spots could be several times larger , because the non - linear dependence of @xmath25 on @xmath88 will imply non - gaussian statistics for the anisotropies .",
    "indeed , as we pointed out in paper i , the @xmath123 will obey a modified form of the @xmath165 distribution , the probability falling off almost exponentially , rather than as a gaussian .",
    "we see that the predicted signal is quite sensitive to both the cosmology and also the baryonic content ( the value and any clumping of @xmath166 ) .",
    "it is also necessary in future work to calculate the damping effects more accurately , and also to take account of the effects of non - gaussianity .",
    "the latter point is especially important in searches which cover limited regions of the sky , and the variance may not be the best statistic to compare with observations .",
    "it is likely that the interpretation of the data at these small angular scales will also be complicated by the need to understand the contribution from discrete sources .",
    "the other potentially important source of temperature anisotropies at these small - angular scales is the sunyaev - zeldovich signal .",
    "however , it should be possible to isolate this signal by its frequency dependence . an important means of distinguishing the effects of tangled magnetic fields",
    "is by looking at the polarisation of the cmbr .",
    "it was shown by seshadri and subramanian ( 2001 ) that the vorticity induced by tangled magnetic fields produces significant and predominantly b - type polarization , at the micro - kelvin levels , and this will also be dominant at large @xmath1 .",
    "these should therefore be distinguishable from anisotropies produced by inflationary scalar and tensor perturbations .",
    "we hope to revisit this issue in a future study .",
    "although we have concentrated on the vorticity induced anisotropy which is dominant on small - angular scales , tangled magnetic fields also produce anisotropies on larger angular scale , dominated by tensor metric perturbations induced by anisotropic magnetic stresses ( durrer , ferreira & kahniashvili 2000 ; mack , kahniashvili & kosowsky 2002 ) . using the formalism described in these papers",
    ", we estimate a tensor contribution at small @xmath167 of @xmath168 for the nearly scale invariant spectrum with @xmath143 and @xmath169 for @xmath155 and @xmath158 . since we have to add this power to the standard power produced by inflationary scalar perturbations , in quadrature , a tangled field with @xmath158 will produce of order a few to 10 percent perturbation to the power in the standard cmbr anisotropy at small @xmath1s .",
    "so if they are indeed detected at large @xmath1 , below the silk damping scale , and if they have a power - law spectrum extending to large - scales , one will also have to consider their effects seriously at large - angular scales , especially in cosmological parameter estimation .",
    "we also note that a magnetic field which redshifts to a present day value of order a nano gauss could impact significantly on the formation of galaxies ( rees & reinhardt 1972 , wasserman 1978 , sb98 ) .",
    "our results therefore provide a way of detecting the presence of small - scale magnetic inhomogeneities at a level which affects the formation of galaxies and clusters .",
