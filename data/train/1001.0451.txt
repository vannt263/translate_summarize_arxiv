    "the classical helly selection principle ( @xcite ) states that _ a bounded sequence of real valued functions on the closed interval , which is of uniformly bounded ( jordan ) variation , contains a pointwise convergent subsequence whose limit is a function of bounded variation_. this theorem and its recent generalizations for real valued functions and metric space valued maps of one real variable ( @xcite ) have numerous applications in different branches of analysis ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "extensions of the helly theorem for functions and maps of several real variables heavily depend upon notions of ( bounded ) variation used for these maps , which generalize different aspects of the classical jordan variation of univariate functions and which are known to be quite numerous in the literature ( e.g. , @xcite , and these references are far from being exhaustive on the topic ) . under some approaches to the multidimensional variation ( @xcite ) involving integration procedures",
    "helly - type theorems are rather concerned with the _ almost everywhere _ convergence of extracted subsequences , and no stronger convergence can be expected in this case , but this convergence is far too weak for certain applications ( such as those from @xcite ) . on the other hand , there are definitions of the notion of variation for _ real valued _ functions of several variables ( @xcite ) , which go back to vitali @xcite , hardy @xcite and krause @xcite , such that a complete analogue of the helly theorem holds with respect to the _ pointwise _ convergence of extracted subsequences .",

    "real valued function of several variables @xcite and an appropriate generalization of jordan s decomposition theorem when a function of bounded variation is represented as the difference of two monotone functions .",
    "the aim of this paper is twofold .",
    "first , we study properties of the _ total variation _ of metric semigroup valued maps of several variables in the approach of vitali , hardy and krause introduced by the first author in @xcite , which extends the classical notion of jordan s total variation for maps of one variable and the notions of the total variation in the sense of hildebrandt @xcite for real valued functions of two variables and leonov @xcite for real valued functions of any finite number of variables .",
    "second , we present two variants of a helly - type _ pointwise _ selection principle for metric semigroup valued maps and maps with values in a reflexive separable banach space .",
    "the main difficulty that we overcome is that for metric semigroup valued maps there is no counterpart of jordan s decomposition theorem , and we have to develop a completely different technique , whose two - dimesional variant is given in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [",

    "the remaining sections [ s : prb][s : pre ] contain proofs of the results exposed in section  [ s : ingred ] and used in the proofs of the main  theorems .",
    "throughout the paper we adopt and follow the vitali - hardy - krause approach to the notion of variation for maps of several variables in the multiindex notation initiated in @xcite and developed in detail in  @xcite ( equivalent approaches in different notation for real functions can be found in @xcite ) .",
