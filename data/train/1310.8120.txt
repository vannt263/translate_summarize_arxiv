    "minimal models play a vital role in many systems that are dedicated to knowledge representation and reasoning .",
    "the concept of minimal model is at the heart of several tasks in artificial intelligence including circumscription @xcite , default logic @xcite , minimal diagnosis @xcite , planning @xcite , and in answering queries posed on logic programs under the stable model semantics @xcite and deductive databases under the generalized closed - world assumption @xcite .    on the more formal side ,",
    "the task of reasoning with minimal models has been the subject of several studies @xcite . given a propositional cnf theory @xmath0 , among others , the tasks of _ minimal model finding _ and _ minimal model checking _ have been considered .",
    "the former task consists of computing a minimal model of @xmath0 , the latter one is the problem of checking whether a given set of propositional letter is indeed a minimal model for @xmath0",
    ".    findings regarding the complexity of reasoning with minimal models show that these problems are intractable in the general case .",
    "indeed , it turns out that even when the theory is positive ( that is , it does not contain constraints ) , finding a minimal model is @xmath1}$]-hard @xcite ( note that positive theories always have a minimal model)}$ ] is the class of decision problems that are solved by polynomial - time bounded deterministic turing machines making at most a logarithmic number of calls to an oracle in @xmath2 . for a precise characterization of the complexity of model finding , given in terms of complexity classes of functions ,",
    "see @xcite . ] , and checking whether a model is minimal for a given theory is co - np - complete @xcite .",
    "the above formidable complexities characterizing the two above mentioned problems have motivated several researchers to look for heuristics @xcite as long as , due to the complexity results listed above and to the still unresolved p vs np conundrum , all exact algorithms for solving these problems remain exponential in the worst case .",
    "one orthogonal direction of research concerns singling out significant fragments of cnf theories for which dealing with minimal models is tractable .",
    "the latter approach has also the merit of providing insights that can help improve the efficiency of heuristics for the general case .",
    "for instance , algorithms designed for a specific subset of general cnf theories can be incorporated into algorithms for computing minimal models of general cnf theories @xcite .    within this scenario , in @xcite",
    "efficient algorithms are presented for computing and checking minimal models of a restricted subset of positive cnf theories , called _",
    "head cycle free _ ( hcf )",
    "theories @xcite . to illustrate , hcf theories are positive cnf theories satisfying the constraint that there is no cyclic dependence involving two positive literals occurring in the same clause .",
    "head - cycle - freeness can also be checked efficiently @xcite .",
    "these results have been then exploited by other authors to improve model finding algorithms for general theories .",
    "for example , the system dlv looks for hcf fragments into general disjunctive logic programs to be processed in order to improve efficiency @xcite .",
    "the research presented here falls into the groove traced in @xcite .",
    "the central contribution of this work is a polynomial time algorithm for computing a minimal model for ( a superset of ) the class of positive hef ( head elementary - set free ) cnf theories , the definition of which we adapt from the homonym one given in @xcite for disjunctive logic programs and which form , in their turn , a strict superset of the class of hcf theories studied in @xcite .    to the best of our knowledge",
    "positive hcf theories form the largets class of cnfs for which a polynomial time algorithm solving the _ minimal model finding _ problem is known so far . since hcf theories are a strict subset of hef ones , our main contribution is the enlargement of the tractability frontier for the minimal model finding problem .",
    "it is worth noting that a relevant difference holds here that while hcf theories are recognizable in polynomial time , for hef ones the same task is co - np - complete @xcite .",
    "although this undesirable property seems to reduce the applicability of the above result , we will show that our approach leads to techniques to compute a model of any positive cnf theory in polynomial time , while the computed model is guaranteed to be minimal at least for all positive hef theories .",
    "notice that this latter property holds without the need to recognize whether the input theory is hef or not .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [",
    "sect : probl_contrib ] , we provide preliminary definitions about cnf theories , present the problems and the sub - classes of cnf theories of interest here , depict contributions of the work , and discuss application examples . in section [",
    "sect : algo ] , we introduce the generalized elimination algorithm ( gea ) , that is the basic algorithm presented in this paper , and the concept of _ eliminating operator _ that it makes use of . then , in section [ sect : hef ] , we formally define hef cnf theories and then construct an eliminating operator that enables gea to compute a minimal model for a positive hef cnf theory in polynomial time . in section [",

    "however , it is unfortunately already known that recognizing hef theories is `` per s '' an intractable problem , which may apparently limit the applicability range of our algorithmic schema . in order to overcome such a problem ,",
    "an `` incomplete '' variant of the gea ( called igea ) is proposed : the resulting schema , once instantiated with an appropriate elimination operator , always constructs a model of the input cnf , which is guaranteed to be minimal at least if the input theory is hef .",
    "we note that this latter algorithm is able to `` declare '' if the returned model is indeed minimal or not .",
    "the research work presented here can be continued along some interesting direction . as a major research direction ,",
    "since the igea is capable to deal also with theories that are not hef , it would be relevant to define , via a syntactic specification , as those pinpointing hcf and hef theories , a superset hef theories coinciding with those on which the igea stops returning a success .",
    "while it is not at all clear if this can be reasonably attained , we might consider it enough to get close ( from below ) to this class of theories .",
    "very related to the above line of research , there is the assessment of the practical occurrence of theories having the hef property or the property of guaranteeing success to the igea and also the assessment of the success rate of the igea on generic cnf theories .",
    "moreover , enhancing stable models and answer set engines for logic programs with the igea appears a potentially fruitful line of investigation",
