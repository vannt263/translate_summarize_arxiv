    "among the major drivers for the evolution of current cellular networks towards the fifth generation ( 5 g ) is the efficient support of machine - to - machine ( m2 m ) communications and services .",
    "different from human - centric services ( h2x ) , which are mainly characterized by the ever - increasing data rates , m2 m services pose a different set of challenges , associated with the support of a massive number of users exchanging small amounts of data , often with requirements in terms of reliability and availability .",
    "a model for a particularly demanding m2 m scenario is the one where the cellular network access should be offered with reliability guarantees in the case of massive almost - simultaneous arrivals .",
    "an example is correlated reporting of an alarm event by tens of thousands of devices in a cell  @xcite .",
    "the main concern in such scenarios is the overload of the cellular access infrastructure , i.e. , the collapse of the random access channel ( rach ) , which happens due to the signaling overhead associated with each individual transmission  @xcite .",
    "we note that the rach overload precludes any service operation , i.e. , blocks the system , and it is therefore of paramount importance to prevent it .",
    "several methods have been recently proposed to prevent the rach overload in lte  @xcite , in the context of m2 m communications .",
    "specifically , two main solutions are the extended class barring ( eab )  @xcite and dynamic allocation  @xcite .",
    "eab is valid only for delay - tolerant m2 m traffic and is an extension of the standard access class barring method . on the other hand ,",
    "dynamic allocation is a straightforward approach : upon detection of rach overload the number of random access opportunities ( raos ) per second is increased .",
    "however , both schemes have inherent limitations , as they are both reactive and triggered upon rach overload detection .",
    "once the overload is detected , there is an additional delay until the eab or the dynamic allocation feedback messages are delivered from the bs to the m2 m devices , which can take up to @xmath0  s  @xcite , as these messages are typically broadcasted periodically over the paging channel .",
    "therefore , these two methods can not ensure timely and reliable operation in m2 m scenarios with massive synchronous arrivals , as it becomes apparent further in this text .",
    "motivated by the deficiencies of the reactive approaches , in this paper we propose a _ proactive _ approach for the reliable support of m2 m service .",
    "the proposed approach consists of two phases , an _ estimation phase _ and a _ serving phase _ , which reoccur periodically . in the first phase ,",
    "the bs estimates how many m2 m devices are attempting to access .",
    "we show that by using an estimator that is tuned to the lte access mechanisms this can be done in a simple and , more importantly , fast manner , requiring just a single rao to estimate the number of accessing users in the order of tens of thousands . following the estimation phase ,",
    "the parameters of the access mechanism are tuned such that the raos of the serving phase are used in an efficient way , providing a reliable service .",
    "the proposed solution can be easily incorporated in the standard lte access mechanism , leaving the radio interfaces intact and used both for the case of massive synchronous arrivals as well as the asynchronous traffic with poisson arrivals . in this way",
    "the mobile operators can provide m2 m service in a controlled manner , with guaranteed reliability and no overload , i.e. , the operators can be provided with a technical data - sheet indicating the performance of the system for a given number of devices and the associated latency .",
    "this is a significant step towards reliable m2 m services in lte , which are currently based on the best effort approach .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : lte_overview ] we present a brief overview of the standard lte rach operation .",
    "section  [ sec : lte_reenginering ] is the central part of the paper , where we describe and analyze the proposed solution , as well as outline its practical implementation .",
    "section  [ sec : case_study ] presents a case study involving two m2 m traffic classes , presenting the performance results and a comparison with competing methods for m2 m access .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : conclusions ] concludes the paper .",
    "the uplink time in lte is divided in frames , where every frame is composed of ten subframes whose duration is 1  ms . the lte frequency band is organized in subcarriers , where 12 subcarriers of 15  khz over a subframe constitute a resource block ( rb ) .",
    "the bandwidth of lte ranges between 6  rbs ( i.e. , 1  mhz ) and 100  rbs ( 20  mhz ) . in lte , a random access opportunity ( rao ) requires 6  rbs in a subframe .",
    "the number of raos per frame is a system parameter , ranging from one rao every 20  subframes to one rao every subframe .",
    "a typical configuration foresees one rao every 5  ms  @xcite .",
    "further , up to 64 orthogonal preamble sequences are available in each rao , which can be detected simultaneously by the base station ( bs ) .",
    "the actual number of available preambles depends on the system configuration , where a typical configuration foresees 54 preambles  @xcite .",
    "the system information blocks ( sib)s , where all announcements including where each rao occurs , are broadcasted periodically via the paging procedure that occurs from every 80  ms up to every 5.12  s  @xcite .",
    "the lte random access procedure , denoted as access reservation procedure ( arp ) , consists of the following four stages .",
    "( 1 ) first , a device ( ue ) , selects one of the preambles and transmits it in one of the raos .",
    "( 2 ) in the case a single ue has transmitted the preamble , the enodeb decodes it and responds by sending a random access response ( rar ) message .",
    "( 3 ) this rar message indicates the rbs where the device shall send its request consisting of a temporary i d together with the establishment cause , e.g. , call , data , report , etc . if two or multiple devices have selected the same preamble within the same rao a collision occurs , the enodeb detects this and does not send back any response .",
    "( 4 ) in the last stage , the enodeb acknowledges the information received from the device and allocates the required data resources . if the ue does not receive a response to a preamble or a request , it restarts the procedure until it is successful or the maximum number of preambles retransmissions is reached .",
    "when the number of devices attempting access is high , most of the rach preambles are selected by multiple devices and end in collisions .",
    "consequently , most devices are not granted access and therefore retry again .",
    "there reattempts coupled with the new arrivals lead to an even higher amount of attempted accesses , further overloading the rach and with the end result of almost no device being granted access .",
    "the general load control mechanism in lte is the access class barring ( acb ) , which works by assigning access probabilities to different access classes  @xcite .",
    "however , as the acb does not distinguish between h2x and m2 m traffic , the eab was defined in @xcite to deal with potential burst of m2 m traffic arrivals .",
    "eab is used to explicitly restrict access from devices configured as delay tolerant .",
    "the core network can also trigger the admission control at the radio access network  @xcite , via dynamic blocking according with the load .",
    "another mechanism proposed to overcome the rach overload is the dynamic allocation mechanism  @xcite . here , whenever the enodeb detects the occurrence of overload , it increases the number of raos per frame . due to the system limitations ,",
    "this increase is up to one rao per subframe , announced to the devices via the paging procedure .",
    "this mechanism can be further enhanced through the expansion of the lte contention space to the code domain  @xcite .",
    "serving raos . ]",
    "the core of the proposed solution consists of a reoccurring access frame , which is composed of raos that are dedicated to m2 m devices .",
    "it is assumed that the arrival process is gated , i.e. , new arrivals are accepted at the frame beginning and all arrivals during the frame wait for the beginning of the next one .",
    "the frame time duration is assumed to be fixed and limited to half of the maximum allowed delay @xmath1 guaranteed by the network operator .",
    "the frame is then composed by up to @xmath2 m2 m dedicated raos within @xmath3 seconds , there will be up to @xmath4 available raos for m2 m access , i.e. , 8 raos per lte frame . ] .",
    "obviously , a larger @xmath2 implies a longer delay , but it also accommodates more devices .",
    "the frame consists of two parts , dedicated to the _ estimation _ and _ serving _ phase , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : framestructure ] .",
    "we design the estimation part such that it consists just of a single rao and describe in section  [ sub : estimationalgorithm ] the proposed estimation technique , showing that a huge range in the number of accessing m2 m devices @xmath5 can be reliable estimated .",
    "the length of the serving phase @xmath6 is determined by the estimated number of arrivals @xmath7 , with the constraint that @xmath8 . the access algorithm in the serving @xmath6",
    "is based on the standard lte rach operation , but tuned to @xmath7 such that its resources , i.e. , raos , are used so that the required reliability @xmath9 is met .",
    "particularly , we distinguish two modes of operation in the serving phase . in the first mode , the length required by the target reliability @xmath10 is lower or equal to @xmath11 and the actual length is set to @xmath12 . in the second mode , @xmath13 , which implies that there are not enough resources to provide required service . in this case",
    ", the length of the serving phase is set to @xmath14 , and a barring factor is introduced to prevent rach overload .",
    "further details on the operation and dimensioning of the serving phase are presented in section  [ sub : servingphase ] .",
    "we assume the estimation takes place in a single rao with @xmath15 preambles .",
    "the preambles are ordered from 1 to @xmath15 ( in a arbitrary way ) and the active devices ( i.e. , devices with traffic arrivals ) choose one of preambles with a predefined probability .",
    "the probability of selecting preamble @xmath16 is given by : @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are a priori determined parameters , whose choice depends on the expected range of the number of users @xmath5 .",
    "the enodeb observes a ternary outcome is described how the collision detection is performed . ] for each preamble - a preamble can be in the _ idle _ state ( no devices transmitted it ) , _ singleton _ state ( a single device transmitted it ) or _ collision _ state ( two or more devices transmitted it ) . based on the observed outcomes ,",
    "the enodeb estimates how many users are present in the frame .",
    "the main idea behind varying the preamble activation probability is to obtain a favorable mix of collision , singleton and idle preambles , which will allow a reliable estimation .",
    "the same idea is standardly used in framed slotted aloha - based estimation algorithms  @xcite .",
    "here we use a modification of a simple technique first proposed in  @xcite , characterized by a large estimation range .",
    "the main difference with respect to  @xcite is that devices are limited to a single transmission due to the physical layer constraints .",
    "let @xmath20 denote the probability that a device has not transmitted any of the previous @xmath21 preambles : @xmath22 with initial condition @xmath23 .",
    "denote the observed state of the preamble @xmath16 preamble as @xmath24 , where @xmath25 if the state is idle , @xmath26 if singleton and @xmath27 if collision . the conditional probability mass function @xmath28 is given by : @xmath29 \\cdot ( 1-p_j)^{a_j \\cdot n } & s_{j } > 1.\\\\                  \\end{array }                \\right .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we note that the above expression is an approximation , as it assumes only the expected number of users capable of transmitting preamble @xmath16 , i.e. , @xmath30 .",
    "however , this approximation allows for an elegant solution that yields accurate results , as demonstrated further .",
    "the estimation of @xmath5 is performed using the sequence of observations @xmath31 , using the maximum likelihood approach : @xmath32 which is obtained by solving for @xmath33 the following equation : @xmath34 using a root - finding method .",
    "we conclude by presenting the estimator performance in fig .",

    "the number of raos in the serving phase @xmath6 should be , if possible , dimensioned according to @xmath5 such that the required reliability @xmath9 is met .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath6 also depends on the access scheme employed in the serving phase , which is based on the lte rach operation , i.e. , based on framed slotted aloha . in the further text , we assume that the serving phase consists of two frames , as depicted in fig .",

    "attempt access by transmitting a single randomly selected preamble in a randomly selected rao , while in the second frame all devices that collided in the first frame reattempt access in the same way .. ] we show that in this way we can achieve close - to - one reliability for a huge range of accessing devices .",
    "raos grouped into two frames of lenght @xmath38 and @xmath39 . ]",
    "we define reliability @xmath40 as the probability of a device successfully obtaining a data resource when there are @xmath5 contending device , at the completion of the access reservation procedure discussed in section  [ sec : lte_overview ] .",
    "for this to occur , the device has to be the only one to select a preamble from the raos available in either of the frames in the serving phase .",
    "we then model the reliability @xmath40 as : @xmath41   p_2(n),\\ ] ] where @xmath42 and @xmath43 denote the probabilities that a device does not collide in the first and second frames , respectively . in the first frame , the success probability is the probability that a device is the only one to select one of @xmath15 preambles in one of @xmath38 raos , when there are @xmath5 contending devices , which is : @xmath44 the success probability in the second frame depends on the number of collisions @xmath45 in the first frame .",

    "when the number of required contention resources is higher than the maximum available @xmath13 , a barring factor @xmath55 is introduced .",
    "this barring probability is then used independently by each device in a bernoulli trial with probability @xmath56 to decide if the device should attempt to access the serving phase . to account with the barring probability ,",
    "is redefined as follows : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the binomial pmf .",

    "this sib message includes the following information : first it indicates in which subframe the upcoming estimation rao will take place together with the values of @xmath60 and @xmath61 and the number of preambles @xmath15 .",
    "further , it informs the contending devices of the number of raos in the serving phase and @xmath38 .",
    "finally , a bitmap is included which indicates in which subframes these raos will occur . if the load exceeds the amount of capacity pre - reserved by the operator , the barring factor @xmath55 is also included in the sib , to prevent the rach overload .",
    "the proposed scheme operation is then as follows .",
    "assume that @xmath5 contending devices become active prior to start of the access frame .",
    "when the estimation rao occurs , each of these @xmath5 devices attempt access , according with the procedure defined in section  [ sub : estimationalgorithm ] , enabling the enodeb to obtain the estimation of the number of arrivals @xmath7 .",
    "the detection of collisions in the estimation phase , is performed during the execution of the access reservation procedure .",
    "namely , after the devices that have selected the same random access preamble , transmit their ue request , which will result in a collision as described in section  [ sec : lte_overview ] .",
    "based on @xmath7 , the enodeb then defines how many raos are required in the serving phase to reach the contracted @xmath9 and informs the devices where these raos will occur by broadcasting the corresponding sib .",
    "then , the contending devices select randomly between the serving raos , using the arp described in section  [ sec : lte_overview ] . in the meantime ,",
    "other contending devices become active , which will wait until the start of the next access frame before proceeding in the same way .",
    "we note that the proposed scheme requires minimal changes to the current lte protocol , with no modifications to the physical layer at all .",

    "further , let tc1 have priority access to the available serving raos over tc2 , e.g. , alarm reports take priority over periodic reporting in the context of smart metering .",
    "specifically , we try first to reach as close as possible to @xmath62 and only then as close as possible to @xmath63 .",
    "furthermore , we assume that each class has separate estimation and serving phases , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : twotrafficclasses ] . at the beginning of the frame",
    "there is one estimation rao for each traffic class , where the number of contending devices of each class is estimated to be @xmath64 and @xmath65 respectively . with the knowledge of @xmath66",
    "we define a resource allocation strategy based on the scheme described in section  [ sec : lte_reenginering ] .",
    "the access frame duration  demarcated by the estimation phase raos occurrence ",
    "is constrained by the traffic class with the most stringent latency requirement , here given by tc1 .",
    "although , in this study we consider that both tcs have an estimation phase in each access frame , we note that in the case where tc2 s latency requirement is much larger than tc1 s , it might be worthwhile to consider the case where tc2 estimation rao only occurs in some of the access frames , in order to optimize the amount of raos dedicated for estimation .",
    "the extension of the analysis in section  [ sec : lte_reenginering ] to two traffic classes is straightforward . denoting as @xmath67 and @xmath68 the amount of serving raos respectively required to serve tc1 and tc2 to meet the reliability requirements of each class , @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the main distinction from the case with a single traffic class , is that now there are three different operation regimes : ( i ) @xmath69 ; ( ii ) @xmath70 with @xmath71 ; and ( iii ) @xmath72 . in ( i )",
    "each traffic class receives the number of required serving raos . in ( ii ) a barring factor @xmath73",
    "is introduced to the lower priority class tc2 , while no barring is necessary for the high reliability class tc1 .",
    "finally in ( iii ) , tc2 is completely barred ( @xmath74 ) and a barring factor @xmath75 is introduced for the high reliability class tc1 . this procedure is described in detail in algorithm  [ alg : contentionresourceallocationtwoclasses ] .",

    "the system parameters of interest for the legacy system are listed in table  [ table : parameters ] ; we assume an ideal , best - case dynamic allocation , where the network overload is detected instantaneously and there is no delay to change the parameters of the system such as the number of available raos .",
    "the incoming traffic is classified into two traffic classes : ( tc1 ) alarm and ( tc2 ) periodic reporting ; where the alarm reporting takes priority over periodic reporting .",
    "the alarm reporting case is modeled by a beta distribution with parameters @xmath78 and @xmath79 @xcite , which trigger @xmath80 smart meters within the cell to access the same access frame with latency requirement @xmath81 .",

    "the proposed mechanism is able to provide a reliable service for a considerably higher range of simultaneously accessing devices .",
    "specifically , the proposed scheme provides service with a reliability guarantee of @xmath91 for up to @xmath92 smart meters if the tolerable delay is @xmath93  s. for tc2 , the offered reliability will be constrained by the amount of tc1 arrivals in the same access frame . however , due to tc1 bursty nature and the less restrictive tc2 latency requirement ( i.e. @xmath94 ) , we have observed that , after the `` storm '' caused by the alarms is over , our solution is able to met the set @xmath63 .",
    "we emphasize , that beyond this specific example , our proposed solution is tailored to offer the traffic reliability requirements , as long as the allowed latency constraints are in accordance with the number of devices to be served .",
    "furthermore , it enables to achieve a trade - off between latency and reliability .",
    "one of the key challenges associated with machine - to - machine ( m2 m ) communications in cellular networks is to be able to offer service with reliability guarantees , particularly when a massive amount of simultaneous m2 m arrivals occurs .",
    "while current solutions take a reactive stance when dealing with massive arrivals , by either imposing barring probabilities or increasing the contention space , they do so without knowledge of the volume of incoming traffic .    here we propose a proactive approach , based on dedicated access resources for the m2 m traffic , combined with a novel frame based serving scheme composed by an estimation and a serving phase . in the estimation",
