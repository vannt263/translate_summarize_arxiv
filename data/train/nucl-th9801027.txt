    "pion absorption / emission processes on a=3 nuclei offer a unique possibility for testing our present understanding of pion  baryon interactions and reaction mechanisms with a minimum of _ ad hoc _ phenomenological assumptions .",
    "it is now possible , in fact , to give a microscopic description of both the nuclear bound state and the three ",
    "nucleon dynamics in the incoming ( or exit ) channel through modern few  body techniques .",
    "a first step towards this goal has been accomplished in a recent paper  @xcite , where pion emission / absorption reactions on tritium have been studied in the energy region around the @xmath3 resonance .",
    "the elementary emission / absorption processes are given by the direct , one  nucleon mechanism , and by the two  body mechanism , proceeding through @xmath3 excitation .",
    "the former is described by a non ",
    "relativistic @xmath8nn vertex , the latter by a @xmath8n@xmath3 vertex , followed ( or preceded ) by isobar propagation , and a @xmath3n@xmath9nn transition mediated by @xmath8 and @xmath10 exchange .",
    "the three  nucleon bound and scattering states in the initial and final channels have been evaluated through numerical solution of the alt - grassberger  sandhas ( ags )  @xcite equations for realistic nn potentials , by resorting to the ernst - shakin  thaler ( est ) expansion method  @xcite , to produce a finite  rank representation of the nn interactions . with this representation , the @xmath8production amplitude including the three ",
    "nucleon correlations can be obtained by solving an integral equation where the off ",
    "shell extension of the plane  wave amplitude represents the driving term .",
    "this approach is similar to a recent treatment of tritium photodisintegration  @xcite .",
    "the transition amplitudes have to be decomposed into three ",
    "nucleon partial waves , whereas the pion  tritium motion is represented by a three  dimensional plane  wave state .",
    "the calculation has been performed in momentum space , and details about the partial  wave formalism can be found elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the phenomenological parameters entering the above calculations are essentially the coupling strengths and cut  offs at the meson  baryon vertices .",
    "these parameters had been tuned previously through the analysis of the simpler @xmath11 reaction  @xcite , over a large experimental database , including cross  sections and polarization observables .",
    "hence , the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite can be regarded as a parameter  free calculation , aiming at ascertaining to what extent the assumed model of the pion ",
    "nucleus dynamics can be extended from the two  nucleon to the three  nucleon system .",
    "these calculations have been compared with experimental integral and differential cross  sections .",
    "the role played by the final or initial  state interactions ( fsi / isi ) has been studied , and the convergence with respect to the number of included partial  wave three  nucleon states has been tested .",
    "it turned out  @xcite that the inclusion of higher partial waves and nuclear correlations have a comparable effect on the cross sections .",
    "good results could be obtained in the considered energy region with both bonn  @xcite and paris  @xcite potentials , the latter producing a lower excitation function with respect to the bonn _",
    "b _ potential , and slightly better results for the differential cross ",
    "sections at backward angles and high energies . around the resonance , and for not too large angles , however , the results for the two potentials differ only in the normalization of the cross  sections , with the excitation function for the paris potential being about 25@xmath12 lower than the bonn _",
    "b _ result .    in the present paper",
    "we extend the analysis to spin observables ( such as the asymmetry @xmath0 , and the deuteron tensor analyzing power @xmath1 ) , and to a larger energy region , in order to get a deeper insight into the merits and limitations of the model employed for the @xmath8three  nucleon dynamics .    for the @xmath11 reaction",
    ", the polarization observables are known to be much more sensitive to the details of the dynamical model than the unpolarized cross sections@xcite .",
    "for this reason , the large variety of spin data has been never reproduced with complete success , in spite of the increasing complexity of the theoretical models .",
    "in particular , the proton analyzing power @xmath0 is one of the most difficult observable to reproduce since it depends on both the magnitude and the relative phases of the intervening helicity amplitudes .",
    "a similar situation appears here for the @xmath13 reaction .",
    "we investigated how much this observable is affected by the partial  wave truncation , and by the inclusion of nuclear correlations in the initial channel .",
    "we found a more pronounced sensitivity to the number of included three  nucleon partial  wave states , with respect to the cross  sections .",
    "when the representation is enlarged to include 18 two  body partial  wave states and s , p , and d orbital states in the intermediate @xmath3 propagation , the theoretical results move towards the experimental points .",
    "the effects of the three ",
    "nucleon correlations in the initial state , on the other hand , turn out to be less important . as for @xmath1 , one can obtain the general trend of the experimental data around the resonance , the results exhibiting a moderate sensitivity to the chosen nn potential at forward angles , and a greater sensitivity at large angles , consistently with the analysis of the unpolarized cross sections .",
    "this model , in its present form , has been built for an analysis around the resonance region , where the intermediate @xmath3n dynamics has to be treated explicitily .",
    "as well known , a theoretical evaluation of the @xmath3 width in the nuclear environment is still beyond present possibilities , since it would entail a consistent solution of the coupled @xmath8nnn@xmath3nn  nnn problem . lacking this theoretical ingredient",
    ", we choose to parametrize the resonance width phenomenologically , starting from the experimental cross section for the @xmath14 reaction .",
    "this phenomenological parameterization implicitly takes into account the non  perturbative aspects of the intermediate @xmath3 propagation within the two baryon subsystem ; it proved successful both in the description of the @xmath11 data from threshold  @xcite up to the resonance region  @xcite , and in the three  nucleon calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite . here ,",
    "we extend the analysis of @xmath15 processes beyond the resonance region for both the cross  sections and spin observables , and compare the outcome of this effective parameterization with the standard relativistic treatment of the @xmath3 width , which applies to a free @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "one finds that the former parameterization provides better differential cross  section in the resonance region , whereas the alternative description works better with increasing energy .",
    "this suggests that non  perturbative effects in the off ",
    "shell @xmath3 propagation are non ",
    "negligible in the resonance region , while their importance decreases at higher energies .",
    "the data are not well reproduced in the low  energy region .",
    "this is particularly true for the tensor analyzing power at forward angles , where one fails even in reproducing the trend of the experimental points .",
    "this had to be expected , because in the present calculations only @xmath4wave absorption mechanisms are considered . at low energies ,",
    "one expects non ",
    "negligible contributions from @xmath6wave pion absorption , involving @xmath8 rescattering on a second nucleon .",
    "such mechanisms play an important role in the @xmath8absorption process , and have to be taken into account in extending the present analysis from the high  energy to the low  energy region , as has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite for the simpler @xmath16 reaction .",
    "the formalism relating cross  sections and polarization observables to the transition amplitudes as given in the present approach is reviewed in section 2 .",
    "the results of calculations are shown and discussed in section 3 .",
    "finally , section 4 contains the summary and conclusions .",
    "the amplitude for the @xmath17 process can be written in terms of the matrix element    @xmath18 and @xmath19 describe the final three  nucleon bound state ( bs ) and the initial three  body scattering state , respectively , and are assumed to be properly antisymmetrized . for both bound state and scattering regimes ,",
    "we use herein the same three ",
    "nucleon states previously employed in ref .",
    "henceforth , we refer to that paper for any details about the faddeev  based calculation of the three  nucleon states .",
    "the states @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the plane  wave states for the two fragments in the asymptotic channels .",

    "to avoid double countings , purely nucleonic intermediate states must be avoided in @xmath24 , since the intermediate propagation of three nucleons is taken into account to all orders when calculating the three ",
    "nucleon dynamics in the final state .",
    "these amplitudes are decomposed in three ",
    "nucleon partial waves , while the pion ",
    "nucleus wave is kept three  dimensional .",
    "we omit the details on the representation employed since all this has been throughly discussed in previous papers  @xcite . herein , we limit ourselves to mention that the three  body states are defined in momentum space and the partial  wave decomposition is discussed within the @xmath25 coupling scheme .",
    "the index @xmath26 collectively denotes the whole set of quantum numbers , namely spin , total angular momentum , and isospin of the pair ( @xmath6 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 , respectively ) orbital , spin , total angular momentum , and isospin for the spectator ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 ) and finally the three ",

    "spin representation , where the angular momentum of the spectator particle , @xmath29 , is coupled to channel spin @xmath35 ( which is the coupling of the spectator  nucleon spin , @xmath36 , to the deuteron spin , @xmath27 ) to give the total angular momentum j. the transformation is    latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }    \\sum_i ( -)^{\\sigma_1+\\lambda+i}\\hat k\\hat i \\left\\lbrace \\matrix{j&\\sigma_1&k\\cr \\lambda & j&i}\\right\\rbrace     the amplitude in this new @xmath29@xmath35 representation will be compactly indicated as    @xmath38    we observe that in this representation the pion and nucleon relative states of motion are treated differently , and , for convenience , we prefer to discuss the amplitudes in terms of the ( inverse ) pion absorption process . by doing so , the initial state is _ not _ decomposed into partial waves , while the final state is .",
    "the quantization axis is parallel to @xmath39 , thus it is the helicity axis for the incoming pion ( obviously , the helicity of the pion @xmath40 is zero ) . for the target particle , the triton",
    ", we take the same axis , but pointing in the opposite direction . hence ,",
    "for the target particle , we have to rotate the frame of @xmath41 around the normal to the scattering plane .",
    "because of this rotation the target helicity is @xmath42 , and the phase factor appears in the equation above .",
    "we construct the partial  wave helicity amplitude    @xmath43    where @xmath44 is the helicity of the outgoing nucleon , and @xmath45 is the helicity of the deuteron . given that @xmath40 is zero , we use the symbol `` / '' in place .",

    "in a previous article  @xcite , it has been shown that the energy dependence and angular distribution of the @xmath67 reaction cross section around the @xmath3 resonance could be reproduced reasonably well with a meson  exchange isobar model with the @xmath8nucleon interaction mediated by the @xmath4wave @xmath8nn and @xmath8n@xmath3 vertices .",

    "the other two curves exhibit the results of the calculations including 464 3n states and differ between each other by the fact that the dotted line includes the effects of the three ",

    ", the difference with the dashed curve is a clear indication that the polarization observables are much more sensitive to the inclusion of a large , possibly converged , set of states than what happens for the unpolarized observables . in particular ,",
    "an important aspect which can not be neglected is played by the @xmath69 and , to a lesser extent , by the @xmath70 orbital states of the @xmath71 subsystem .",

    "these calculations have been tailored for the reproduction of the pion production reaction in a region limited around the @xmath3 resonance .",
    "indeed , the main limitation in the energy range derives from the treatment of the width of the @xmath3 resonance , whose range of validity is restricted in the region below @xmath76 for @xmath73 .",
    "the explicit parametric form of the isobar width @xmath77 is given in ref .",
    "@xcite ; it has been derived starting from the shape of the experimental @xmath8absorption cross section on deuterons , @xmath78 , by imposing the condition    @xmath79    plus the additional condition that at the resonance peak @xmath80 , the isobar width coincides with the experimental value of 115 mev ( this last condition fixes also the constant @xmath70 ) .    the same energy dependence has been employed without further changes in previous analyses for the @xmath81 ( ref .",

    "( [ ritchie ] ) . at the present stage",
    ", there is no definitive explanation for this behavior .",
    "we may however argue that , as the pion momentum @xmath73 increases to a value around 2 , the isobar in the intermediate @xmath3nn propagation tends to behave as a free  particle propagation , while at lower energy the importance of the @xmath71 higher order interactions prevents a description in terms of free isobar propagation . if this is the case , the superior results obtained at lower energy by the parameterization from eq .",
    "( [ ritchie ] ) can be understood in the light of the fact that the @xmath3 width obtained directly from the experimental @xmath92 excitation function must include , albeit in some phenomenological and approximate way , the @xmath71 higher order interactions , while the baryon  baryon interactions are certainly excluded when the width is parameterized from the @xmath86 scattering data .",
