    "in the past , divergent series have played a central role in mathematics .",
    "mathematicians like for instance lacroix , fourier , euler , laplace , etc .",
    "have used them extensively .",
    "nowadays they play a marginal role in mathematics and are often not mentioned in the standard curriculum .",
    "a number of mathematicians and most students are not aware that they can be of any use .    where was the turn ?",
    "according to @xcite , the turn occured in the time of cauchy and abel , when the need was felt to construct analysis on absolute rigor .",
    "so let us go back a little and see what cauchy and abel have said of divergent series .",
    "cauchy ( preface of analyse mathmatique `` , 1821 ) : _ jai t forc dadmettre diverses propositions qui paratront peut - tre un peu dures .",
    "par exemple quune srie divergente na pas de somme  \" _",
    "( i have been forced to admit some propositions which will seem , perhaps , hard to accept .",
    "for instance that a divergent series has no sum  '' )    cauchy made one exception : he justified rigorously the use of the divergent stirling series to calculate the @xmath0-function .",
    "we will explain below the kind of argument he made when looking at the example of the euler differential equation .",
    "abel ( letter to holmboe , january 16 1826 ) : _ les sries divergentes sont en gnral quelque chose de bien fatal et cest une honte quon ose y fonder aucune dmonstration .",
    "on peut dmontrer tout ce quon veut en les employant , et ce sont elles qui ont fait tant de malheurs et qui ont enfant tant de paradoxes .",
    " enfin mes yeux se sont dessills dune manire frappante , car  lexception des cas les plus simples , par exemple les sries gomtriques , il ne se trouve dans les mathmatiques presque aucune srie infinie do nt la somme soit dtermine dune manire rigoureuse , cest -  - dire que la partie la plus essentielle des mathmatiques est sans fondement .",
    "pour la plus grande partie les rsultats sont justes il est vrai , mais cest l une chose bien trange .",
    "je moccupe  en chercher la raison , problme trs intressant . \" _",
    "( divergent series are , in general , something terrible and it is a shame to base any proof on them . we can prove anything by using them and they have caused so much misery and created so many paradoxes .  . finally my eyes were suddenly opened since , with the exception of the simplest cases , for instance the geometric series , we hardly find , in mathematics , any infinite series whose sum may be determined in a rigorous fashion , which means the most essential part of mathematics has no foundation . for the most part , it is true that the results are correct , which is very strange .",
    "i am working to find out why , a very interesting problem . \" )    the author was struck by this citation when she first read it 27 years ago and this citation has followed her for her whole career . in her point of view , this citation contains the past , present and future of divergent series in mathematics .    * the past : * as remarked by abel , divergent series occur very often in many natural problems of mathematics and physics . their use has permitted to do successfully a lot of numerical calculations .",
    "one example of this is the computation by laplace of the secular perturbation of the orbit of the earth around the sun due to the attraction of jupiter .",
    "the calculations of laplace are verified experimentally , although the series he used were divergent .    *",
    "the present : * in the 20-th century divergent series have occupied a marginal place .",
    "however it is during the same period that we have learnt to justify rigorously their use , answering at least partially abel s question . in the context of differential equations the borel summation , generalized by calle and others to multi - summability ,",
    "give good results ( see for instance @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "* the future : * why do so many important problems of mathematics lead to divergent series ( see for instance @xcite ) ? what is the meaning of a series being divergent ? finding an answer to",
    "this question is a fascinating research field .",
    "we will illustrate all this on the example of the euler differential equation : @xmath1    since this is a short paper , the list of references is by no means exhaustive .",
    "the euler differential equation has the formal solution @xmath2 which is divergent for all nonzero values of @xmath3 .",
    "on the other hand , it is a linear differential equation whose solution can be found by quadrature : @xmath4 the integral is convergent for @xmath5 and hence yields a solution of .",
    "we can rewrite this solution as @xmath6 in which we make the change of coordinate @xmath7 .",
    "this yields @xmath8 the integral is convergent for @xmath9 , so the solution @xmath10 is well defined for @xmath5 and moreover @xmath11 .    what is now the link between the divergent power series @xmath12 and the function @xmath10 ?",
    "we will show that the difference between @xmath10 and a partial sum @xmath13 is smaller than the first neglected term ( this part has been inspired by @xcite ) .",
    "this is exactly as in the leibniz criterion for alternating series .",
    "for any @xmath9 @xmath14    proof .",
    "we use the following formula which is easily checked @xmath15 then @xmath16    using the following formula @xmath17 which implies @xmath18 this yields @xmath19 where @xmath20 , the remainder , is the difference between @xmath10 and the partial sum @xmath21 of the power series .",
    "the result follows since @xmath22 @xmath23    the argument given here , which justifies rigorously the use of the divergent series in numerical calculations , is very similar to the argument made by cauchy for the use of the stirling series .",
    "in particular , cauchy used the formula .    *",
    "if we use the power series to approximate the function @xmath10 , how good is the approximation ?",
    "*    we encounter here the main difference between convergent and divergent series . with convergent series , the more terms we take in the partial sum , the better the approximation .",
    "this is not the case with divergent series . indeed ,",
    "if we take @xmath3 fixed in the general term tends to @xmath24 .",
    "so we are better to take the partial sum for which the first neglected term is minimum .",
    "@xmath25 is minimum when @xmath26 . in that case @xmath27 .",
    "we use stirling formula to approximate @xmath28 for @xmath29 large : @xmath30 this gives us @xmath31 which is exponentially small for @xmath3 small .",
    "not only have we bounded the error made when approximating the function by the partial sum of the power series , but this error is exponentially small for small @xmath3 , i.e. very satisfactory from the numerical point of view",
    ".    the phenomenon we have described here is not isolated and explains the successes encountered when using divergent series in numerical approximations .",
    "looking at what we have done with the euler equation , someone can have the impression we have cheated .",
    "indeed we have chosen a linear differential equation , thus allowing us to construct by quadrature a function which is solution of the differential equation .",
    "but what about the general case ?    in general",
    ", once we have a formal solution by means of a power series , we use a _ theory of resummation _ for finding a function which is a solution . in this paper",
    ", we will focus on the _ borel method of resummation _ , also called 1-summability .",
    "we start with the properties that an adequate theory of summability must satisfy :    * properties of a good method of resummation ( see for instance @xcite ) : * we consider a series @xmath32 , to which we want to associate a number @xmath33 , called its sum :    \\(1 ) if @xmath32 is convergent , then @xmath33 should be the usual sum of the series .",
    "\\(2 ) if @xmath32 and @xmath34 are summable with respective sums @xmath33 and @xmath35 then @xmath36 is summable with sum @xmath37 .",
    "\\(3 ) a series @xmath32 is _ absolutely summable _ if the series @xmath38 is summable .",
    "\\(4 ) if @xmath32 and @xmath34 are absolutely summable with respective sums @xmath33 and @xmath35 , then the product of the series , @xmath39 , where @xmath40 , is absolutely summable with sum @xmath41 .",
    "\\(5 ) if @xmath32 is summable with sum @xmath33 , then @xmath42 is summable with sum @xmath43 .",
    "\\(6 ) ( in the context of differential equations ) if @xmath44 is summable with sum @xmath10 , then @xmath45 is summable with sum @xmath46 .    *",
    "the borel method of resummation for a series : * we present it in a way which proves at the same time the property ( 1 ) : the idea is to take a convergent series @xmath47 and to write its sum @xmath48 in a different way . for this purpose ,",
    "we use and we write @xmath49 changing the order of the summation and the integral in the last line requires a proof , which we leave as an exercise .    a series @xmath32 is _ borel - summable _ if the series @xmath50 has a nonzero radius of convergence , if it can be extended along the positive real axis and if the integral @xmath51 is convergent with value @xmath33 .",
    "we call @xmath33 the _ borel sum _ of the series",
    ".    * example : * in the case of the solution of the euler differential equation we have @xmath52 .",
    "then @xmath53 hence @xmath54 which is .",
    "we adapt the definition of borel - summability to power series in a manner that will allow to use it for analytic extension .    1",
    ".   a power series @xmath55 is 1-summable ( borel - summable ) in the direction @xmath56 , where @xmath56 is a half - line from the origin in the complex plane if * the series @xmath57 has a nonzero radius of convergence , and the sum of the series is an analytic function @xmath58 on the disk of convergence , * the function @xmath58 can be extended along the half line @xmath56 , * and the integral @xmath59 is convergent with value @xmath60 .",
    "+ we call @xmath33 the sum of the series .",
    "a power series @xmath55 is 1-summable if it is 1-summable in all directions @xmath56 , except a finite number of exceptional directions .",
    "* example : * the solution of the euler differential equation is 1-summable in all directions except the direction @xmath61 .",
    "the problem in the direction @xmath61 comes from the singularity at @xmath62 in or .",
    "a theory of resummation is useful if there are theorems associated to it .",
    "for instance , for the borel summation , let us cite this theorem of borel :    @xcite we consider an algebraic differential equation @xmath63 where @xmath64 is a multivariate polynomial . if @xmath65 is a formal solution of and @xmath66 is absolutely borel - summable with borel sum @xmath10 , then @xmath10 is solution of the differential equation and has the asymptotic expansion @xmath67 .",
    "\\(1 ) the sums of a 1-summable series in the different directions @xmath56 give functions which are analytic extensions one of the other as long as we move the line @xmath56 continuously through directions in which the series is 1-summable .",
    "this yields a function defined on a sector with vertex at the origin .",
    "more details can be found for instance in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "\\(2 ) the borel sum of a divergent power series can never be uniform in a punctured neighborhood of the origin .",
    "it is necessarily ramified .",
    "this is what is known in the literature as the _ stokes phenomenon_.    \\(3 ) if a series @xmath68 has a radius of convergence equal to @xmath69 and its sum is a function @xmath10 for @xmath70 , then a theorem of complex analysis states that the function @xmath10 has a least one singularity on the circle @xmath71 .",
    "the idea of borel is that a divergent series is a series with radius of convergence @xmath72 .",
    "hence , we have at least one singularity hidden in some direction : for the euler differential equation , this is the direction @xmath61 .",
    "the operation @xmath73 sends the singularity at a finite distance , as if we had blown the disk of convergence to bring it from radius @xmath74 to radius @xmath75 .",
    "@xmath76 is called the _ borel transform _ of @xmath66 .",
    "the 1-summability and its extensions have been extensively studied during the 20-th century .",
    "extensions of the notion of 1-summability have been obtained by allowing ramifications @xmath77 .",
    "then 1-summability in @xmath3 corresponds to @xmath78-summability in @xmath79 .",
    "the notion of multi - summability has also been introduced : a series @xmath66 is multi - summable if it is a finite sum @xmath80 , each @xmath81 being @xmath82-summable .",
    "explicit criteria allow to decide a priori that some systems of differential equations have multi - summable solutions in the neighborhood of certain singular points ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "let us now look at a generalized euler differential equation @xmath83 for almost all functions @xmath84 analytic in the neighborhood of the origin and such that @xmath85 the formal solution of vanishing at the origin is given by a divergent series .",
    "only in very special cases the equation has an analytic solution at the origin .",
    "* example : * @xmath86 is the analytic solution of @xmath87    what is the difference between the equations and",
    "? to understand we will apply successively the two steps :    * complexify : we will allow @xmath88 ; * unfold : @xmath89 is a double singular point of each equation .",
    "hence , we will introduce a parameter so as to split the double singular point into two simple singular points .",
    "* complexification : * let us consider a function @xmath10 which is the borel sum of a solution of , and its analytic extension when we turn around the origin .",
    "the function @xmath10 is ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) :    * uniform for ; * ramified for , and generically ramified for a solution of .",
    "the two branches differ by a multiple of @xmath90 ( which is a multiple of a solution of the homogeneous equation ) .    * how to understand that generically we should have ramification ? * to answer we unfold and embed into @xmath91 with @xmath92 .",
    "we will limit here our discussion to @xmath93 , although all complex values of @xmath94 are of interest .",
    "since solutions of the homogeneous equation associated to are given by @xmath95 , the local model of solutions at @xmath96 is given by @xmath97 with @xmath98 analytic .",
    "hence , the solution @xmath98 ( corresponding to @xmath99 ) is the unique solution which is analytic and bounded at @xmath100 .",
    "similarly the local model for solutions at @xmath101 is given by @xmath102 we now have two cases :    \\(1 ) if @xmath103 , then @xmath104 is analytic .",
    "since @xmath105 is ramified at @xmath106 for @xmath107 , all solutions but @xmath104 are ramified .",
    "it is of course exceptional that the extension of @xmath98 at @xmath108 be exactly the solution @xmath104 and , generically , we should expect that the analytic extension of @xmath109 is @xmath110 with @xmath107 .",
    "hence the extension of @xmath98 should be ramified at @xmath106 . if this ramification holds till the limit @xmath111 we get figure  1(a ) .",
    "\\(2 ) let us now consider the case @xmath112 .",
    "we must again divide the discussion in two cases :    \\(i ) in the generic case , @xmath104 is ramified : it contains one term of the form @xmath113 .",
    "\\(ii ) in the exceptional case , @xmath104 is analytic , and so are all solutions through @xmath106 .",
    "hence , it is impossible for @xmath98 to be ramified at @xmath106 .",
    "this case is excluded in the unfolding of an equation whose solution is ramified .",
    "let us now summarize the very interesting phenomenon we have discovered : if the formal solution of is divergent , then in the unfolding :    * necessarily @xmath98 is ramified at @xmath108 : the divergence means a form of _ incompatibility _ between the local solutions at two singular points @xmath114 , which remains until the limit at @xmath111 .",
    "* * parametric resurgence phenomenon : * for sequences of values of the parameter @xmath94 converging to @xmath111 ( here @xmath115 ) , the pathology of the system is located exactly at one of the singular points . indeed , here",
    ", the only way for the system to have an incompatibility is that one of the singular points be pathologic .",
    "we have understood why divergence is the rule , and convergence the exception .",
    "the phenomena described above are much more general than the context of described here , and are explored by the author and her collaborators in different contexts .",
    "the common thread is that @xmath75-summability occurs when two equilibrium points of a dynamical system coallesce in a double point .",
    "there are some rigid dynamics attached to each simple equilibrium , and these rigid dynamics do not match well until the limit when the two equilibria coallesce .",
    "divergent series also occur in the phenomena involving small denominators .",
    "a source of divergence in this case is the accumulation of particular solutions .",
    "for instance , in the case of a fixed point of a germ of analytic diffeomorphism @xmath116 , @xmath117 , with @xmath118 , the divergence of the linearizing series could come from the accumulation of periodic points around the fixed point at the origin .",
    "the study of this phenomenon is part of the work for which jean - christophe yoccoz received the fields medal in 1994 .",
    "divergent series occur generically in many situations with differential equations and dynamical systems . the divergence of the series carries a lot of geometric information on the solutions .",
    "for instance , if the formal power series solution of the euler equation had been convergent , its sum could not have been ramified .",
