    "in view of its relative simplicity , the standard model for the afterglows of gamma - ray bursts @xcite has proven to be surprisingly successful ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . synchrotron radiation from behind a spherically symmetric shock , caused by the interaction between an external medium and a relativistically expanding fireball , accounts for an impressive amount of observed characteristics .",
    "deviations from the expected behavior observed for some afterglows during their later stages have been attributed to an aspherical outflow , for example , a jet geometry .",
    "jet - edge effects and the lateral expansion of the outflow then increase the rate of decline of the light curves as well as the typical synchrotron frequency @xcite .",
    "however , afterglows exist for which the later stages of the evolution show no signs of deviation from a spherical outflow ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite noticed several afterglows to have soft x - ray fluxes in excess of that obtained by extrapolating from the infrared / optical spectral range . such an additional spectral component is not expected and indicates that the standard model is incomplete .",
    "there are also some afterglows whose observed properties in the infrared / optical spectral range do not comply with standard predictions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "although the properties of most observed afterglows are well accommodated within the standard model , the reason is not clear for the small likelihood of a given gamma - ray burst to produce an observed afterglow ; for example , an adiabatic outflow requires rather large variations in the source parameters between different gamma - ray bursts in order to suppress the emitted radiation below the observed values for the majority of the afterglows .",
    "this issue has been discussed by @xcite for the prompt afterglows .",
    "we suggest these shortcomings to be due , at least in part , to the neglect of compton cooling . in order not to increase the number of free parameters in the standard model",
    ", it is assumed that compton scattering occurs on the self - produced synchrotron photons .",
    "normally , arguments used for not considering compton scattering together with synchrotron radiation include : the observations are well explained by synchrotron cooling only and energy equipartition between relativistic electrons and magnetic fields makes compton scattering marginally important , at most , for the observed spectral evolution of the afterglows @xcite . for many afterglows ,",
    "observations are not extensive enough to allow a determination of independent values for the source parameters and , hence , the assumption of equipartition is one of convenience , since the plasma properties behind the shock are not understood well enough to strongly motivate such a choice .",
    "however , sometimes the preferred value for the partition of energy between electrons and magnetic field is such that a consistent description requires compton scattering to be included ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is in line with the arguments of @xcite that a major reason for the varied appearance of afterglows is a wide range of values for the magnetic field .",
    "the effects on the synchrotron spectrum from first order compton scattering have been discussed by @xcite .",
    "synchrotron radiation can be seen as compton scattering of virtual photons due to the magnetic field .",
    "hence , in a situation when all electrons scatter off the same real photons , the instantaneous synchrotron spectrum is indistinguishable from one for which the cooling is due to synchrotron radiation ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the main aim of the present paper is three - fold : ( i ) determine the phase of the afterglow evolution during which this spectral degeneracy occurs .",
    "( ii ) characterize the spectral properties and their evolution outside this degenerate phase for situations when compton cooling affects the afterglow .",
    "( iii ) apply these results to observed afterglows in order to estimate the role played by compton scattering .",
    "there are two suggested physical settings for the gamma - ray burst phenomenon , namely , the merger of a neutron star with another compact object and the explosion of a hypernova @xcite . for the afterglow ,",
    "the main difference between these two scenarios is the assumed properties of the external medium into which the shock moves . in the former case , the external medium is assumed to have properties similar to the interstellar medium , while in the latter case the shock encounters a wolf - rayet  type stellar wind .",
    "the importance of compton scattering is determined mainly by the value of the energy density in electrons relative that in magnetic fields . since this ratio is likely due to local plasma processes behind the shock , rather than global properties , the inclusion of compton scattering is qualitatively similar for the two cases .",
    "hence , for convenience , the discussion is limited to the case with an interstellar  type external medium .    in  2",
    "the relevant timescales are defined for afterglows in which the cooling is dominated by compton scattering .",
    "it is shown that the evolution can contain up to three phases each with its own cooling characteristics .",
    "the spectral properties , including light curves , of these phases are discussed in  3 .",
    "two specific afterglows ( grb 980923 and grb 971214 ) are discussed in  4 .",
    "they have been chosen since their observed properties suggest them to be outside the degenerate phase .",
    "the values derived for the source parameters imply compton cooling to have significantly affected the evolution of both these afterglows .",
    "the implications for afterglows in general are briefly discussed in  5 .",
    "in the standard model for the afterglow of gamma - ray bursts , electrons and magnetic fields are injected through a relativistic shock .",
    "there is evidence for a non - spherical shock ; however , as long as the lorentz factor of the shock is larger than the inverse of the angular extent of the asphericity , the observed evolution is well described by a spherically symmetric shock .",
    "the calculations below assume the validity of such a description .",
    "furthermore , the discussion is restricted to the forward shock .",
    "we will adopt the usual convention of measuring the thermodynamic quantities of the shocked gas , including the energy density of photons , in its own restframe , while other quantities are measured in the restframe of the external medium .",
    "let the electron energy distribution , injected behind the spherically symmetric shock , be given by @xmath0 for @xmath1 and zero otherwise , where @xmath2 is the lorentz factor of the electron .",
    "the typical frequency emitted by an electron with lorentz factor @xmath3 is @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the frequency emitted by those electrons ( @xmath6 ) , which have a cooling time equal to the dynamical time scale of the shock . in order to simplify the discussion ,",
    "@xmath7 is assumed so that the peak of the energy density in synchrotron photons occurs at a frequency @xmath8    when cooling is complete , the energy density of photons behind a relativistic shock is roughly equal to the energy density injected through the shock .",
    "if cooling is not complete ( i.e. , @xmath9 ) , the photon energy density is smaller by a factor @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , the energy density of synchrotron photons , @xmath11 , at @xmath5 is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the fractions of the injected energy which go into relativistic electrons and magnetic fields ( @xmath15 ) , respectively .",
    "the modification to equation ( [ 2.1 ] ) , needed when compton scattering off the self - produced synchrotron photons dominates the cooling , can be obtained as follows . since synchrotron radiation can be regarded as compton scattering of virtual photons due to the magnetic field ( ` zeroth ' order compton scattering ) , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the thomson optical depth of electrons , with lorentz factor @xmath18 , radiating at @xmath19 .",
    "likewise , when compton scattering dominates the cooling , the main cooling of electrons with lorentz factor @xmath2 occurs on photons with frequency @xmath20 with a corresponding energy density @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , the analogue of equation ( [ 2.1 ] ) , when compton scattering dominates synchrotron radiation as the main cooling mechanism , takes the form @xmath22 + the relation given in equation ( [ 2.2 ] ) is a formal one and the expressions for @xmath23 and @xmath20 have to be determined for each situation .",
    "there are two simple , limiting cases ; scattering in the klein - nishina limit which implies @xmath24 and scattering in the thomson limit when @xmath20 is independent of @xmath2 and all electrons cool on the same photons .",
    "the latter case can arise , for example , when @xmath3 is large enough for the emission in first order compton scattering to be well separated from the synchrotron component while , at the same time , the klein - nishina limit prevents appreciable radiation in second order compton scattering .",

    "we now discuss and contrast the salient features of the observed radiation in these three limits , i.e. , cooling due to synchrotron radiation , compton scattering , respectively , in the thomson and klein - nishina limits .",
    "the above arguments show that compton cooling is important whenever @xmath28 .",
    "\\label{2.4}\\ ] ] the value of @xmath29 is model dependent but @xmath30 is expected , where @xmath31 is the velocity of the shock relative the shocked gas .",
    "hence , as mentioned above , for a relativistic shock @xmath29 is of order unity . when source parameters are such that the condition in equation ( [ 2.4 ] ) is fulfilled , compton scattering should affect the evolutionary properties of the afterglow .",
    "it is convenient to divide the observed behavior into three phases according to the different cooling regimes .",
    "synchrotron cooling dominates early on , while compton scattering in the thomson limit can take over during an intermediate stage . for @xmath3 small enough ,",
    "multiple compton orders become possible . hence , at late times multiple scattering may be possible in which cooling is likely to occur in the klein - nishina limit . furthermore , cooling in the klein - nishina limit is expected to be important also during the transition between the different phases .",
    "these separate phases will be referred to as the synchrotron , thomson , and multiple compton scattering phase , respectively .",
    "as is shown below , in the standard scenario for the afterglow , its emission may go through one , two , or all three of these phases .",
    "the scattering cross - section for an electron with lorentz factor @xmath2 drops rapidly for photon frequencies larger than @xmath32 ( the klein - nishina limit ) , given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the bulk lorentz factor of the shocked gas , @xmath35 is the electron mass , and @xmath36 is the planck constant .",

    "@xmath78 is required , in which case the transition takes place at @xmath79 ( cf .",

    "when there is no transition to the multiple compton scattering phase , the source remains in the thomson phase as long as @xmath81 , which implies @xmath82 furthermore , in order for compton cooling to be important the inequality in equation ( [ 2.4 ] ) must be valid , which results in ( @xmath83 ) @xmath84 hence , for @xmath85 , the duration of the thomson phase is determined by the relative values of @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "these characteristic times are useful for describing the properties of the emitted radiation only as long as @xmath88 , where @xmath89 , in days , is the approximate time when the outflow becomes subrelativistic .",

    "the best studied afterglows have been observed mainly in the near infrared / optical spectral range . for values of source parameters thought relevant for the standard model , this corresponds to the frequency range where the synchrotron radiation is expected to be emitted during the thomson phase ( cf .",
    "[ [ 3.6 ] ] and [ [ 3.13 ] ] ) . in this phase , it is hard to distinguish observationally between two very different physical situations ; namely , one in which compton scattering dominates the cooling and another where compton scattering plays a minor role .",
    "in fact , a rather large parameter space exists ( cf .",
    "[ [ 2.20 ] ] or [ [ 2.20b ] ] ) in which it is not even in principle possible to separate the two cases when only the synchrotron component is observed ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this section the afterglows of grb 980923 and grb 971214",
    "are discussed .",
    "they have been selected primarily because their observed characteristics suggest that they do not entirely radiate in the phase where the values of the source parameters are degenerate .",
    "hence , these afterglows should allow a determination of the importance of compton scattering in their evolution .",
    "the afterglow of grb 980923 is likely to be in the synchrotron phase .",
    "the rather odd behavior of the infrared / optical afterglow in grb 971214 ( eg .",
    ", wg99 ) is ascribed to the source being in the transition stage between the thomson and multiple compton scattering phases .",
    "the batse observations of the prompt afterglow from grb 980923 exhibited a break in the spectrum which evolved with time towards lower frequencies @xcite .",
    "interpreted as synchrotron radiation from the forward shock , @xcite showed this break to be consistent with the synchrotron cooling frequency , @xmath42 , and incompatible with @xmath4 .",
    "their conclusion is based on two independent pieces of evidence , namely the time evolution of the break frequency as well as the flux .",
    "however , as shown in  3.2 , synchrotron radiation and compton scattering in the thomson phase have similar cooling characteristics .",
    "since @xmath146 , the cooling frequency evolves slower with time in the thomson phase than in the synchrotron case .",
    "the observed value @xmath193 implies @xmath194 ( cf .",
    "[ [ 2.11 ] ] ) instead of @xmath195 .",
    "although the observed light curve favors synchrotron cooling , the uncertainties in both the flux and spectral slope are such that compton scattering in the thomson phase can not be excluded .",
    "we therefore consider both cases together .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the parameter @xmath196 ; this is the value of @xmath13 for which cooling due to synchrotron radiation equals that in compton scattering ( cf .",
    "[ [ 2.4 ] ] ) .",
    "the observed fluence ( @xmath197 ) can then be related to the source parameters as    @xmath198    where equations ( [ 4.1a ] ) and ( [ 4.1b ] ) correspond , respectively , to cooling due to synchrotron radiation and compton scattering in the thomson phase .",
    "the lower fluence in the thomson phase is due to the fact that only a fraction @xmath199 of the emitted energy emerges as synchrotron radiation ( cf .",
    "[ [ 2.3 ] ] ) .",
    "the luminosity distance to the source is denoted by @xmath200 .",
    "likewise , expressions for @xmath14 are obtained from equations ( [ 2.8 ] ) and ( [ 2.9 ] ) . with the use of the observed value @xmath201 hz at @xmath202 s ,",
    "one finds    @xmath203    for the two cases .",
    "the fluence in the afterglow for @xmath204 s is @xmath205 , which results in    @xmath206    where @xmath207 is the luminosity distance in units of @xmath208 cm .",
    "it is seen from equations ( [ 4.3a ] ) and ( [ 4.3b ] ) that observations require @xmath209 for both the synchrotron ( @xmath210 ) and thomson ( @xmath211 ) case . for standard values of @xmath45 and @xmath48 , this places the source in the local universe ( i.e. , @xmath212 ) . since the distance to grb 980923 is not known such a solution can not be ruled out _ a priori_. the identical constraints on the source parameters obtained for the synchrotron case and compton scattering in the thomson phase is an example of the general result derived in  3.2 .",
    "a cosmological distance can be made compatible with standard values for @xmath45 and @xmath48 if the afterglow of grb 980923 is in the synchrotron phase and @xmath213 .",
    "assuming the afterglow to be in the transition stage between the synchrotron and thomson phases implies that the cooling is due to first order compton scattering in the klein - nishina limit .",
    "however , as discussed in  3.1 , possible spectral breaks under such conditions either increase with time ( @xmath193 ) or decrease too rapidly with time to be compatible with the evolution of the observed spectral break .",
    "hence , a consistent description requires the cooling to be due to synchrotron radiation .",
    "the requirement of negligible compton cooling at @xmath42 constrains the allowed values of the source parameters . for a given",
    "observed flux at @xmath42 , the value of @xmath214 increases with @xmath100 ; hence , the weakest constraints are obtained for @xmath102 .",
    "since no low frequency break in the spectrum is apparent , @xmath215 hz . the expression for @xmath100 ( eq . [ [ 3.1 ] ] ) together with @xmath102 then requires @xmath216 .",
    "if compton cooling is important at @xmath4 , the electrons would cool down quickly to at least @xmath217 , which results in a flat ( @xmath218 ) spectrum in the frequency range @xmath219 ( cf .",
    "this increase in flux below @xmath4 makes the cooling time independent of frequency in the range @xmath220 .",
    "hence , assuming @xmath221 , no compton cooling at @xmath42 is equivalent to no compton cooling at @xmath4 .",
    "negligible compton cooling at @xmath4 requires @xmath222",
    "^ 2}.      \\label{4.4}\\ ] ] since the energy density below @xmath4 is proportional to @xmath223 , @xmath224 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath225 and equation ( [ 4.4 ] ) yields @xmath226 with the use of equation ( [ 3.1 ] ) and @xmath227 this can be written @xmath228    when @xmath229 , the restrictions set by the lack of compton scattering is more model dependent . however , a definite lower limit to @xmath14 can be obtained by assuming negligible compton cooling only at @xmath42 but ( unphysically ) no enhancement of the flux below @xmath4 due to cooling of electrons with @xmath230 .",
    "the condition @xmath231 then leads to @xmath232 this lowers the limit of @xmath14 in equation ( [ 4.5 ] ) only marginally . with the use of the expression for @xmath100 ( eq . [ [ 3.1 ] ] ) and the observed upper limit of @xmath4 , one finds from equation ( [ 4.7 ] ) @xmath233 or a factor @xmath234 larger if equation ( [ 4.5 ] ) is used .",
    "although the main aim of the present paper is to discuss the qualitative features introduced by significant compton cooling in an otherwise standard synchrotron model , it should be mentioned that the minimum values of @xmath14 in equations ( [ 4.5 ] ) and ( [ 4.7 ] ) are likely to be slightly too restrictive for two reasons .",
    "the above estimate assumes @xmath83 .",
    "a lower value may be appropriate , since even for a relativistic shock @xmath235 .",
    "furthermore , the value used for the klein - nishina frequency is too large ; the decline in the cross - section sets in at somewhat lower frequencies than assumed in equation ( [ 2.5 ] ) @xcite .",
    "for example , using @xmath236 and a value of the klein - nishina frequency half as large as that in equation ( [ 2.5 ] ) reduce the lower limit of @xmath14 by a factor 7.6 as compared to those given above .    with the assumption of a cosmological distance to grb 980923 ,",
    "the observations of its afterglow together with equations ( [ 4.2a ] ) and ( [ 4.3a ] ) indicate : ( 1 ) a value of @xmath45 substantially larger than unity and/or a value of @xmath48 substantially smaller than unity , although within the range thought applicable for the standard scenario .",
    "( 2 ) the value of @xmath14 needs to be close to its lower limit allowed by the observed lack of compton cooling ( @xmath237 ) .",
    "( 3 ) the value of @xmath13 can not be much smaller than unity .",
    "this shows that in order for the afterglow to be detected by batse , the values of @xmath13 and @xmath14 are quite constrained .",
    "for values of @xmath14 considerably smaller than given in equation ( [ 4.8 ] ) compton cooling dominates and for values larger than this , @xmath42 falls below the batse frequency range ; in either case , the result is a diminishing observed fluence .",
    "likewise , a value of @xmath13 considerably smaller than unity also lowers the fluence below the detectability of batse .",
    "hence , in general , for canonical values of @xmath238 and @xmath48 , the detection of a prompt afterglow by batse implies values of @xmath14 and @xmath13 not too different from the ones derived above for grb 980923 .",
    "@xcite pointed out that for large values of @xmath13 the shock may become radiative if @xmath239 .",
    "he showed that the energy in the shock decreases , roughly , as @xmath240 . in the case of grb 980923 , @xmath241 for most of the synchrotron phase .",
    "with the parameters derived above @xmath64 ( cf .",
    "[ [ 2.20 ] ] or [ [ 2.20b ] ] ) and , hence , the afterglow should enter the thomson phase , which implies @xmath242 .",
    "the cooling of the shock in the thomson phase continues until @xmath243 .",
    "the fraction of the initial shock energy which is radiated away is then @xmath244 .",
    "the rather large value deduced above for @xmath13 suggests that radiative cooling may have been important for the dynamics of the afterglow of grb 980923 in its later phases .",
    "the afterglow of grb 971214 showed a drop in the k - band flux by a factor 34 between @xmath245 days and @xmath246 days @xcite . at @xmath247",
    "the spectrum exhibited a break at @xmath248 hz @xcite together with evidence for significant reddening @xcite . within the context of a standard synchrotron model ,",
    "this optical break can be due either to @xmath4 or @xmath42 .",
    "however , wg99 emphasized that either choice gives rise to serious inconsistencies .",
    "interpreted as @xmath4 , the break predicts an increasing flux in the k - band between @xmath249 and @xmath247 rather than the observed decrease .",
    "wg99 used the synchrotron model and its expected correlation between spectral index and rate of decline of the light curve to correct for the reddening .",
    "assuming that the break corresponds to @xmath42 , and @xmath250 , in order to account for the decline of k - band flux , the dereddening leads to a flat or weakly declining intrinsic flux distribution below the break .",
    "this is in contrast to the predicted rise corresponding to a spectral index @xmath251 .",
    "wg99 also discussed several other unattractive features , which result from a straightforward application of the synchrotron model .    interpreting the optical break as @xmath42 leaves the x - ray flux unexplained , while it is accounted for when the break is due to @xmath4 .",
    "however , the latter case strains the derived source parameters ; for example , in order to be a consistent solution , @xmath252 ( cf .",
    "[ [ 2.4 ] ] ) .",
    "the observed values @xmath253 and @xmath254 together with @xmath255 , imply @xmath256 .",
    "this upper limit to the density is much smaller than values expected in the standard model .",
    "hence , even disregarding the initial k - band flux measurements , the observed spectrum at @xmath247 makes the synchrotron model incomplete .    in view of the limitations of the synchrotron model to account for the observed properties of the afterglow in grb 971214 , we suggest the discrepancy between observations and model predictions to be due to the neglect of compton scattering .",
    "below we discuss a scenario in which the observations correspond to the stage when the dominant contribution to the cooling changes from first to second order compton scattering .",
    "the infrared / optical emission is synchrotron radiation , while the x - ray emission is due to compton scattering of the lower frequency synchrotron radiation .",
    "the optical spectral break is assumed to be due to @xmath4 , which , in turn , is larger than @xmath5 , i.e. , cooling is important for all electrons injected at the shockfront . at @xmath249 second order compton scattering starts to dominate the cooling at @xmath257 , the frequency corresponding to the k - band . for larger frequencies cooling",
    "is still in the thomson limit .",
    "hence , the spectral index between @xmath258 and @xmath4 is @xmath259 . at @xmath247 second order compton scattering",
    "dominates the cooling in the frequency range below @xmath4 .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath260 lies on the @xmath142 part of the first order compton component . hence , @xmath261 , which leads to a spectral index of @xmath262 between @xmath258 and @xmath4 ( cf .",
    " 3.1 ) .    with the use of @xmath160 and @xmath263 ( @xmath264 ) , the fluxes at @xmath258 at @xmath249 and @xmath247 , respectively ,",
    "are related by @xmath265 since @xmath266 and @xmath267 , equation ( [ 4.9 ] ) yields @xmath268 , which is consistent with the observed value .",
    "hence , the proposed scenario can account for the decline in the k - band flux as well as the spectral index below the break at @xmath247 .",
    "we now discuss the values of the source parameters which result from the above interpretation of the observations .",
    "the aim is to show that such a scenario is plausible rather than to perform a detailed comparison . in order to achieve the latter , numerical calculations are necessary ; in particular , since second order compton scattering is assumed to play an important role .",
    "including the redshift dependence in equation ( [ 2.7 ] ) , the observed values of @xmath269 and @xmath270 lead to @xmath271 with the use of equation ( [ 4.10 ] ) one finds in the thomson phase @xmath272 it is shown below that a consistent solution suggests a value of @xmath273 not substantially below unity .",
    "the time dependence of @xmath4 implies @xmath274 .",
    "hence , @xmath5 in equation ( [ 4.11 ] ) is close to @xmath258 at @xmath249 and second order compton scattering affects the cooling only for @xmath275 .",
    "furthermore , the k - band flux should reach a maximum for @xmath276 , i.e. , at @xmath277 .",
    "the observations of @xcite are consistent with this expectation ; although the errors are rather large , the flux measured at @xmath278 is roughly equal to that at @xmath249 ( @xmath279 ) , i.e. , the decline in the k - band flux is likely to have started at @xmath280 .",
    "the flux at @xmath4 in the thomson phase for @xmath190 is @xmath281 where the numerical coefficient is taken from wg99 . for simplicity ,",
    "the cosmological parameters have been chosen as @xmath282 and @xmath283 and @xmath284 is the hubble constant normalized to @xmath285 km s@xmath286 mpc@xmath286 .",
    "since it is assumed that second order compton scattering affects the cooling at @xmath4 only for @xmath287 , equation ( [ 4.12 ] ) can be used together with the reddening corrected ( wg99 ) value @xmath288 @xmath289jy to deduce @xmath290 or from equation ( [ 4.10 ] ) @xmath291 where @xmath292 has been used .    during the thomson phase , the synchrotron energy density peaks around @xmath4 ( for @xmath190 ) , while the energy density of first order compton scattered radiation reaches a maximum around @xmath293 . hence , equation ( [ 2.3 ] )",
    "implies @xmath294 since cooling at @xmath249 due to first and second order compton scattering is assumed to be equal for electrons with lorentz factors around @xmath295 , at this time the photon energy densities at @xmath4 and @xmath260 should be roughly equal .",
    "furthermore , in order for the compton cooling below @xmath4 at @xmath247 to occur on the @xmath296 part of the first order compton flux , @xmath260 can not be significantly larger than @xmath297 at @xmath249 .",
    "hence , an upper limit to @xmath95 is obtained from equation ( [ 4.15 ] ) by using @xmath298 , @xmath299 where logarithmic factors in the compton scattered component have been neglected , i.e. , a spectral index of @xmath259 is assumed between @xmath300 and @xmath301 . from equations ( [ 4.11 ] ) and ( [ 4.14 ] ) this results in @xmath302    the major uncertainty in the numerical value in equation ( [ 4.17 ] ) is likely due to the neglect of light travel time effects .",
    "the typical time for escape through the shockfront for a photon produced in the shock is the dynamical time scale .",
    "inclusion of a finite escape time for the photons has two major consequences , both of which tend to decrease the lower limit in equation ( [ 4.17 ] ) .",
    "since cooling is important , higher frequencies are produced closer to the shock front than are the lower ones .",
    "hence , at a given time , the observed radiation at lower frequencies reflects conditions at an earlier time than do that at larger frequencies .",
    "the rate of energy injection at the shock front decreases with time , which suggests the energy density in the first compton component to increase less rapidly between @xmath297 and @xmath301 than assumed in equation ( [ 4.16 ] ) .",
    "this expectation is consistent with the finding of @xcite that the x - ray spectral index as measured by bepposax is likely to be larger than @xmath303 ; their preferred value is @xmath304 .",
    "furthermore , higher compton orders involve photons which were originally produced at earlier times .",
    "again , due to the decreasing rate of energy injection at the shockfront , at a given time the relative strength of higher compton orders is increased for larger escape times .",
    "a quantitative evaluation of these effects requires numerical calculations .",
    "however , it is not likely that they will change the main conclusion of the above analysis ; namely , in order for compton scattering to give a consistent description of the afterglow of grb 971214 , the value of @xmath13 can not be significantly below unity while that of @xmath48 can not be much larger than unity .",
    "we note that the values deduced for the source parameters of grb 971214 are rather similar to those for grb 980923 ; in particular , the value of @xmath13 is quite large , which suggests that radiative cooling may be important .",
    "the parameter values derived above relied on the assumption that the source was in the thomson phase at @xmath249 . at @xmath247 this is not so since the flat or slightly rising spectrum up to @xmath4 is ascribed to the effects of second order compton scattering . as emphasized before , inclusion of multiple compton scattering considerably increases the complexity of the problem ; however , the spectrum at @xmath247 presented by wg99 can be used to make a independent consistency check of the scenario discussed above . for the redshift of grb 971214 , @xmath305 hz . since cooling due to second order compton scattering",
    "is assumed to be important below @xmath4 at that time , the energy densities at @xmath4 and @xmath306 should be approximately equal .",
    "observations show that @xmath307 is roughly a factor of three larger at x - ray frequencies ( @xmath308 ) than at @xmath4 .",
    "although the spectral shape of the compton scattered radiation is unknown below the x - ray band , this factor may be too small to account for the observed synchrotron spectrum below @xmath4 .",
    "there are two effects , which can account for this possible difference .",
    "the reddening correction applied by wg99 is substantial .",
    "it was calculated assuming a pure synchrotron model . however , the reddening correction may be smaller , since the correlation between intrinsic spectral index and rate of decline of the flux , used by wg99 , is no longer valid for the scenario discussed here . furthermore , the scattered photons have on average a longer escape time than the synchrotron photons . for a given observed flux ,",
    "this results in a larger effective energy density behind the shock of the former as compared to the latter .",
    "in the standard model for the afterglows of gamma - ray bursts , the observed properties are determined by the values of four parameters ( @xmath309 , and @xmath14 ) .",
    "plausible values of @xmath238 and @xmath48 come from the overall scenario for the gamma - ray burst phenomenon , while the values of @xmath13 and @xmath14 are most likely the result of not - so - well understood local plasma processes .",
    "although energy requirements favor values of @xmath13 not substantially below unity , the value of @xmath14 is considerably harder to constrain .",
    "equipartition arguments have been invoked to motivate the use of @xmath310 .",
    "modelfitting of well observed afterglows can be used to derive values of the source parameters . however , for values of @xmath238 and @xmath48 thought relevant for the standard model , a large fraction of the afterglows are likely to have been observed during a phase in their evolution in which they suffer from a spectral degeneracy ; namely , the observed spectra can be fitted equally well by cooling either due to synchrotron radiation or compton scattering .",
    "although , in principle , well sampled light curves can break this degeneracy , observations are usually not extensive enough to accomplish this .",
    "it was argued that the afterglows of grb 980923 and grb 971214 were observed outside this degeneracy phase .",
    "the derived source parameters indicate compton cooling to have played an important role during their evolution and , hence , @xmath311 at least for these afterglows .    when cooling is enhanced by significant compton scattering , a minor fraction of the radiated energy escapes as synchrotron emission .",
    "as a result , a given set of observations of the synchrotron component corresponds , on average , to larger values of @xmath13 and/or @xmath238 than for negligible compton scattering .",
    "although the accuracy of the values determined for the source parameters in the afterglows of grb 980923 and grb 971214 is rather low , it was emphasized that values of @xmath13 close to unity are implied for both of them .",
    "together with the extended times during which the cooling was complete , this suggests the possibility of the shock becoming radiative .",
    "if cooling in the afterglows of most gamma - ray bursts is dominated by compton scattering , the values of @xmath13 would be larger than normally deduced .",
    "hence , for a radiative shock , rather small variations in the values of @xmath13 could lead to large changes in the emitted flux during the later stages of the evolution , for example , when the synchrotron emission falls in the infrared / optical spectral range .",
    "it was also pointed out that in order for prompt afterglows , like the one connected to grb 980923 , to be detected by batse the values of @xmath13 and @xmath14 are quite restricted .",
