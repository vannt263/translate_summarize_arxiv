    "repulsion of nearby individuals is sometimes considered a nonlocal term @xcite , analogous to the attractive potential @xmath18 given in eq .

    "our planar analysis ( secs .",

    ", for @xmath144 we find that large flocks have an approximately constant interior density .",
    "we considered planar flocks depending only on one cartesian coordinate as well as ellipsoidal shaped flocks .",
    "the analysis of planar flocks was analytically convenient because the basic nonlinear equilibrium equation could be integrated by the method of quadrature .",
    "insight gained from the analysis of planar flocks allowed a good understanding of ellipsoidal flocks , particularly in the case of large flocks with @xmath144 .",
    "our ellipsoidal flocks can be thought of as resulting from anisotropic sensing and response of flocking individuals to their neighbors . in our modeling scheme",
    "this resulted in an ellipsoidal shape with principle axes aspect ratios that were independent of flock size , and this feature is in apparent agreement with observation @xcite .",
    "recent work @xcite has suggested that an individual in a flock interacts with an approximately fixed number of other flock members .",
    "thus the geometrical interaction range is larger / smaller when the flock density is lower / higher .",
    "reference @xcite calls this behavior interaction through ` topological distance ' .",
    "we have shown that our model and results based on purely - geometrical distance - determined interactions can be simply transformed into a model and corresponding results incorporating topological distance .",
    "thus our main conclusions are robust in that they apply for geometrical distance and topological distance interaction models .",
    "finally we investigated the long - wavelength stability of our planar equilibria and found that they were always unstable to perturbations within the plane .",
    "we interpret this instability as being due to the domination of long - range attraction over repulsion at long wavelength .",
