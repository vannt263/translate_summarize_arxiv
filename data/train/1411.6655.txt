    "we include in this discussion the case in which the underlying manifold is allowed to be non - compact or have a boundary .",

    "we assume for simplicity that @xmath0 is non - singular , i.e. that it is given by a smooth family of riemannian metrics @xmath2 on a @xmath3-manifold @xmath4 that satisfies the ricci flow equation @xmath5 .",

    "resut i : non - collapsedness controls curvature ( proposition [ prop : genperelman ] , subsection [ subsec : perelmanlongtime ] ) this result is a generalization of a celebrated theorem of perelman .",
    "it roughly states the following :    _ for every @xmath6 there are constants @xmath7 and @xmath8 such that if @xmath9 and @xmath10 , then the the following holds : if the time-@xmath11 volume of the time-@xmath11 ball @xmath12 is greater than @xmath13 and the time-@xmath11 sectional curvatures are bounded from below by @xmath14 on this ball , then @xmath15 on @xmath16 .",

    "( i.e. @xmath41-injective ) @xmath42 or @xmath43-fibers . on the other hand , if this collapse occurs along @xmath42 or @xmath43-fibers that are compressible in @xmath4 , but incompressible in some subset @xmath44 , then the volume of @xmath35 might be comparable to that of @xmath38 , but the the volume of the ball @xmath45 around a lift @xmath46 of @xmath34 in the universal cover @xmath47 of @xmath48 will be much larger .",

    "we will now use the following terminology ; for more details see definition [ def : goodness ] : for every point @xmath32 and time @xmath50 , we first fix a local scale @xmath51 , which roughly measures how large the negative sectional curvatures are in a neighborhood around @xmath34 ( for more details see definition [ def : rhoscale ] )",

    "result iv : bounded curvature at bounded distance from sufficiently collapsed and good regions ( proposition [ prop : curvcontrolincompressiblecollapse ] , subsection [ subsec : boundedcurvboundeddistgoodregions ] ) this result can be interpreted as a variant of result ii in the collapsed case .",
