    "the dynamics of bose einstein condensates ( bec ) in harmonically confined optical lattices is one of the key objects of cold matter research shin . while the fundamental equation which describes the mean field solution , the gross - pitaevski equation ( gpe ) @xcite , is readily amenable to a numerical solution , explicit analytical expressions for the condensate ground state @xmath2 and the associated chemical potential @xmath1 are scarce .",

    "we note that , as @xmath37 increases , the condensate spreads , i.e. , the wave function delocalizes , while its maximum decreases . the analytical solution ( [ exafi ] ) is less accurate at @xmath107 and @xmath122 ( with an error less than @xmath123 ) , in agreement with the results of fig .

    "moreover , for @xmath131 the contribution of @xmath130 to the order parameter , induced by the optical lattice , resembles the function @xmath129 , though with opposite sign .",

    "we have noted that at @xmath107 the functions @xmath129 and @xmath130 reach their minimum and maximum values , respectively . in the right panel of the figure we compare the harmonic oscillator wave function @xmath114 with the order parameter as predicted by ( [ exafi ] ) .",
    "we chose three different points @xmath136 , @xmath137 , and @xmath138 in the parameter space of the left panel for this comparison : indeed , @xmath136 does not fulfill the condition ( [ cond ] ) , and , consequently , @xmath2 does not match @xmath114 .",

    "a similar analysis applies in regions iii and iv , with respect to the relative contributions of @xmath151 and @xmath144 .",

    "this working point is indicated by a solid circle in fig .",
    "[ fig6](b ) , and shows that our perturbative method is applicable in the experimental parameter range .",
    "we provided closed analytical expressions for the chemical potential and the particle density of the gpe ground state in an optical lattice .",
    "these solutions were obtained by a perturbative expansion in the lattice strength and in the ( attractive or repulsive ) atom - atom interaction , with a well - controlled range of validity in the associated parameter space .",
    "interestingly , the interaction - induced non - linearity may be quenched by the presence of the lattice . under certain conditions",
