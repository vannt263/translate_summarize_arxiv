    "the relative dispersion of pairs of particles is important because of its connection with the problem of concentration fluctuations @xcite and because of the insight it provides into the spatial structure of turbulent flows .",
    "in contrast with single particle dispersion , which is mostly driven by the large scale  energy containing  eddies , the dispersion of pairs of particles depends on velocity fluctuations of order the separation of the pairs .",
    "thus , the early stages of relative dispersion , up to the integral time scale , are expected to reflect the universal nature of small scale turbulence ( independent of the large scale flow ) and the intermittent character of the energy cascade .",
    "the latter appears to manifest itself in some particle pairs remaining close together for long periods of time while others separate rapidly .",
    "clearly , a good understanding of the mechanisms of relative dispersion will lead to better models . among key features of relative dispersion",
    "are a separation dependent time scale and long - time correlations of quantities such as the relative velocity .",
    "many different types of quantitative models of relative dispersion have been proposed including lagrangian stochastic models e.g. @xcite and kinematic simulation @xcite . for a review of relative dispersion and lagrangian stochastic models in particular ,",
    "we refer the reader to sawford @xcite . in recent years",
    "it has become apparent that the success of these models at small scales will depend on their ability to capture the intermittency of the separation process @xcite .",
    "one purpose of this paper is to provide a detailed quantitative and qualitative analysis of the separation process which we hope will eventually lead to improved models .",
    "results from observations of the spread of marked particles ( pairs or clouds of tracers in the atmosphere and in the ocean ) , summarised in classical textbooks such as those by monin and yaglom @xcite and pasquill and smith @xcite , is testimony to the difficulty in getting reliable experimental data in fully developed turbulence .",
    "although much progress has been made in recent years in experimental measurements of single lagrangian particles @xcite , relatively few lagrangian measurements have been obtained following pairs of particles .",
    "a notable exception is ott and mann @xcite who report lagrangian inertial range scaling even at modest reynolds numbers , of the order @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the taylor scale reynolds number . as a result , direct numerical simulation ( dns )",
    "is still the most important source of detailed lagrangian statistics ( e.g. @xcite at reynolds numbers up to order @xmath3 ) . in this paper",
    "we analyse the results of a recent dns of @xmath4 homogeneous isotropic turbulence seeded with lagrangian particles @xcite .",
    "although homogeneous isotropic turbulence has limited application to real situations , it is the simplest configuration for studying the statistics of relative dispersion .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section [ dns ]",
    "we outline the numerical scheme used for calculating the data and discuss statistical uncertainty and variability .",
    "we present results on the statistical properties of both the particle pair separation and its relative velocity .",
    "these are considered in sections [ sep_stats ] and [ vel_stats ] , respectively . in both cases",
    "we compute the statistics as a function of time and as a function of separation , that is , at fixed scales .",
    "the latter allows for a more accurate separation of the dissipative , inertial and the integral scale regions .",
    "the direct numerical simulation of homogeneous isotropic turbulence was performed on @xmath5 and @xmath6 cubic lattices with reynolds numbers @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "the navier - stokes equations were integrated using fully de - aliased pseudo - spectral methods for a total time spanning nearly three decades ( from the order of a tenth of the kolmogorov time scale , @xmath9 , to approximately three times the integral time scale , @xmath10 ) .",
    "the flow was forced by keeping the total energy constant in the first two wavenumber shells @xcite .",
    "the flow at @xmath11 was seeded with approximately two million lagrangian passive tracers once a statistically stationary velocity field had been obtained .",
    "the positions and velocities of the particles were stored at a sampling rate of @xmath12 .",
    "the numerical parameters are summarised in table  [ tab1 ] . in this dns ,",
    "dissipative scales are well resolved , satisfying @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the grid spacing .",
    "the lagrangian velocity was calculated using linear interpolation which was demonstrated to be adequate for obtaining well resolved particle accelerations @xcite .",
    "the particles were initially arranged in tetrads which were uniformly distributed in the flow .",
    "a total of 960,000 pairs with initial separations @xmath15 and @xmath16 were formed this way .",
    "particle pairs with larger initial separations were formed by following pairs chosen from different tetrads . in this way we also follow pairs with initial separations",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath18 . the number of pairs varied from @xmath19 to @xmath20 depending on the chosen initial separation . in both cases",
    "a particle may have been used more than once to form a pair .",
    "previous studies have shown that lagrangian statistics are affected by highly non - gaussian fluctuations ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "thus , it is important to quantify the statistical uncertainty of some typical variable in order to ensure the reliability of the results within our statistical sample .",
    "statistical errors were estimated by dividing the sample into five sub - ensembles and calculating the minimum and maximum values .",
    "we find that the error is at worst approximately @xmath21 for the separation skewness and approximately @xmath22 for the relative velocity skewness .",
    "the nature of the forcing scheme used in the present dns meant that relatively little temporal variability of globally - averaged quantities was observed ( see overholt and pope @xcite for discussion on forcing schemes and temporal variability ) .",
    "in particular , fluctuations about the mean of the energy dissipation , @xmath23 , were at most 10% during the evolution of the dns .",
    "thus , in the following we may safely use @xmath23 ( and other globally - averaged quantities ) to scale the two - particle statistics .",
    "we consider the motion of two marked fluid particles , labelled by the superscripts @xmath24 and @xmath25 . in homogeneous turbulence , it is sufficient to consider the statistics of the instantaneous separation of the positions of the two particles , namely @xmath26",
    ". furthermore , in isotropic turbulence , the separation magnitude @xmath27 plays a fundamental role in the problem of relative dispersion .",
    "following the well known ideas of richardson @xcite , relative dispersion in the inertial range of time scales , @xmath28 , can be described in terms of a diffusion equation for the probability density function ( pdf ) of the pair separation @xmath29 . in spherical",
    "coordinates this is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a scalar eddy diffusivity . on the basis of experimental measurements in the atmosphere",
    ", richardson proposed that @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a dimensionless constant . assuming a small enough initial separation and a large enough travel time , it can be shown ( see e.g. monin and yaglom @xcite , p. 574 ) that a spherically symmetric solution of ( [ eq : diffusion ] ) is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a normalisation constant .",
    "this exhibits strong non - gaussianity with a narrow peak at the origin and very large tails and gives rise to the celebrated scaling for the second order moment @xmath36 here @xmath37 is the richardson constant which is supposed to be universal .",
    "this result was also derived by obukhov @xcite using kolmogorov s classical theory of turbulence ( k41 ) @xcite .",
    "the richardson pdf is perfectly self - similar , all positive moments behave according to the dimensional law : @xmath38 .",
    "the scaling ( [ eq : t3 ] ) is notoriously difficult to achieve both in laboratory experiments and in dns on account of the large separation of scales that is required to observe it . as a result ,",
    "estimates of @xmath39 have varied widely , from @xmath40 to @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "the main practical difficulties in achieving a long inertial subrange are due to dissipative range effects at the ultraviolet end of the spectrum and integral scale effects at the infrared end of the spectrum . in the dissipation range , pairs separate exponentially and with widely varying growth rates  some pairs separate rapidly while others remain close together .",
    "this leads to the formation of a broad distribution of separations . as a result , slowly separating pairs ( which remain in the dissipative range ) and rapidly separating pairs ( which approach the integral scales ) contaminate the statistics in the inertial range .",
    "a very large reynolds number is therefore required to produce reliable lagrangian statistics in the inertial range .    in figure",
    "[ fig : r2_mean_1 ] we plot the mean square separation @xmath42 versus @xmath43 , normalised by the kolmogorov microscales , @xmath44 and @xmath45 respectively .",
    "although the curves begin to collapse at large @xmath43 , they do not display a @xmath46 scaling and still show a dependence on the initial separation .",
    "thus , any attempt to extract the value of the richardson constant will be marred by the memory of the initial separation . the simplest way to measure",
    "@xmath39 is to plot @xmath42 scaled by the asymptotic prediction , @xmath47 , and look for a plateau .",
    "these curves are displayed in the inset of figure [ fig : r2_mean_1 ] .",
    "it is clear that none of them produces a good plateau and given the spread of curves with different initial separations , the value will be at best an order of magnitude estimate subject to considerable uncertainty .    an alternative method , used in @xcite , consists of fitting a straight line to @xmath48 in a suitable time interval .",
    "if equation ( [ eq : t3 ] ) holds , this straight line , when extrapolated back towards @xmath49 , should pass through the origin and have a slope of @xmath50 .",
    "for all curves we find a small non - zero intercept whose value varies with @xmath51 .",
    "this introduces an extra free parameter in the linear fit corresponding to the non - zero intercept .",
    "the curve with the smallest non - zero intercept has @xmath52 and gives a value of @xmath53 with an error of the order of approximately @xmath54 depending on the time range ( here taken to be @xmath55 ) .",
    "this value of @xmath39 is smaller than that found by yeung and borgas @xcite and ishihara and kaneda @xcite , though still of the same order of magnitude , but agrees well with that of ott and mann @xcite and boffetta and sokolov @xcite .    in order to make a more complete analysis of richardson s model , we compute the pdf of the separation distance .",
    "the richardson pdf relies on two phenomenological assumptions : the first is that the eddy - diffusivity is self - similar , the second is that the velocity field is short - time correlated .",
    "however , it is known that anomalous corrections to the k41 scalings exist ( see e.g. @xcite ) and these are likely to complicate the situation .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdf_richardson ] we compare the separation pdf for the smallest initial separation , @xmath56 , calculated from the dns data , with that predicted by richardson , namely ( [ sep_pdf ] ) . for small times ( up to @xmath57 )",
    ", we observed a rapid change in shape with the pdf showing a pronounced tail , which indicates that while most pairs are still close together some have moved very far apart ( not shown ) . at these times",
    "the curves do not rescale indicating that the early stages of the separation process is very intermittent . here",
    ", the physics of the dissipative range still exerts an influence on the separation process and so we would not expect agreement with the richardson pdf . only for times in the range @xmath58",
    "do we find reasonable agreement with the richardson pdf .",
    "we note that while at @xmath57 we find good agreement for the tail but a large mismatch for values close to the peak , at @xmath59 the pdf is almost undistinguishable from ( [ sep_pdf ] ) . at large times",
    "the particles are moving more or less independently and so the pdf of @xmath60 will be a chi squared distribution with three degrees of freedom ( not shown ) .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the separation pdf can be made by considering the separation skewness , @xmath61 , and the kurtosis , @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the mean separation distance and @xmath64 is the root mean square separation distance .",
    "these are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : skewness_kurtosis_r ] for @xmath56 and clearly show the intermittent nature of the separation process at small times .",
    "the richardson pdf , of course , predicts constant values for the skewness and kurtosis , namely @xmath65 and @xmath66 respectively and which are not reached until approximately @xmath67 .",
    "this time is within the inertial subrange and we may have expected the skewness and kurtosis to level off before decreasing to their large time values ( @xmath68 and @xmath69 respectively ) . that this is clearly not the case suggests that either contamination of the inertial range due to the dissipative and integral scales prevents us from having a region of constant skewness and kurtosis , or points to shortcomings in the richardson model .",
    "these results put the difficulties of calculating richardson s constant ( described above ) into context .",
    "a perfect collapse of curves in the pdf would have implied self - similarity but its absence is not necessarily an indication of the failure of the richardson model ; as we have already discussed , each end of the inertial range is affected by , respectively , dissipation range and integral scale effects . in section [ exit - times ] we show how these problems may be overcome by measuring statistics at fixed scales .",
    "we conclude this section by considering the correlation function @xmath70 of the separation distance for travel times within the inertial subrange .",
    "this quantity , which probes two different times along the separation process , is influenced by the temporal properties of the turbulent energy cascade sustaining the separation growth . in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : r_correlation ] we plot @xmath71 for @xmath72 at different travel times @xmath43 for pairs with initial separation @xmath56 . in agreement with jullien _",
    "@xcite , we find that @xmath71 broadens with increasing travel time indicating that the pairs decorrelate more slowly at larger travel times , a consequence of the fact that larger and larger eddies have slower and slower dynamics . in the body of the figure we plot the same data versus @xmath73 .",
    "dimensional analysis shows that @xmath74 .",
    "we see that all the curves collapse onto a single curve supporting the dimensional prediction .",
    "to disentangle the effects of different scales , an alternative approach , based on _ exit time _ statistics , has been proposed @xcite .",
    "this consists of fixing a set of thresholds , @xmath75 , where @xmath76 and @xmath77 and then calculating the time , @xmath78 , taken for the pair separation to change from @xmath79 to @xmath80 . by averaging over the particle pairs ,",
    "we obtain the mean exit time , @xmath81 , or mean _ doubling time _ if @xmath82 .",
    "formally we are calculating the first passage time .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that all pairs are sampled at the same scales and that finite reynolds number effects are less important @xcite . for particle pairs with initial condition @xmath83 , a perfectly reflecting boundary condition at @xmath84 , and an absorbing boundary condition at @xmath85 , the pdf of the exit time",
    ", @xmath78 , is defined to be @xmath86 from which we get @xmath87 on making use of ( [ eq : diffusion ] ) .",
    "following boffetta and sokolov @xcite , we can derive a solution of the @xmath88 diffusion equation ( [ eq : diffusion ] ) in terms of an eigenfunction decomposition .",
    "this gives us @xmath89 where @xmath90 , @xmath91 is a bessel function of the first kind , @xmath92 where @xmath93 are the zeros of @xmath91 and @xmath94 are constants .",
    "it then follows from ( [ eq : pdf_exit ] ) that the large time asymptotic form of the exit time pdf is given by @xmath95 where @xmath96 is a numerical constant derived from the leading zero of the bessel function described above .",
    "using richardson s diffusion equation ( [ eq : diffusion ] ) , the mean exit time can be shown to be @xcite @xmath97 in the body of fig .",
    "[ fig : mean_exit_time ] we plot @xmath98 for a range of initial separations .",
    "it is immediately clear that there is no dependence on the initial separation in contrast to the mean square separation calculated as a function of time ( see fig .",

    "moreover , we see a clear inertial scaling region in which the mean exit time grows almost like @xmath99 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : mean_double_time ] ) provides us with a method for calculating the richardson constant ( since @xmath33 is related to @xmath39 ) : @xmath100 in the inset of figure [ fig : mean_exit_time ] , we plot the expression ( [ richardson_const ] ) for the richardson constant versus @xmath101 , for various initial conditions .",
    "we see that a collapse of curves is beginning to form for all initial separations .",
    "we estimate the value of @xmath39 to be approximately @xmath102 , which agrees with the value computed above and with previous estimates of @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "this method has the advantage of relative insensitivity to the initial separation and avoids the problem of the non - zero intercept discussed in [ sep_time ] .",
    "of course , the present calculation of @xmath39 assumes the validity of richardson s model .",
    "we find that @xmath39 does not change significantly for @xmath103 $ ] .",
    "it is also worth noticing that the estimate of @xmath39 is not very sensitive to the reynolds number ( see inset of fig .",

    "the exit time pdf , @xmath104 , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdf_exit ] for @xmath56 and clearly shows the exponential nature of the exit time pdf at large times .",

    "we note here that this collapse deteriorates with increasing @xmath106 .",
    "we have shown that by focusing on properties at fixed scales a good agreement with the theoretical prediction ( [ eq : pdf_exit ] ) can be achieved .",
    "free of the effects of the infrared and ultraviolet cut - offs , the richardson diffusion model appears to work well for the inertial range of scales . for small exit times , @xmath107 , on the other hand ,",
    "we do not find a complete collapse of curves at different thresholds , indicating that pairs with a fast separation are likely to exhibit intermittency ( see inset of fig .  [ fig : pdf_exit ] ) .",

    "conversely , the moments of the inverse exit times , @xmath108^p { \\rangle}$ ] , are dominated by those pairs which separate rapidly and correspond to positive moments of the separation .",
    "kolmogorov scaling based on dimensional analysis then leads to @xmath109 assuming that a reasonable estimate of the exit time is given by @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is the relative velocity at scale @xmath101 , intermittency corrections can be quantified in terms of the multifractal formalism @xcite : @xmath112 where @xmath113 are the scaling exponents of the eulerian velocity structure functions as predicted by the multifractal formalism . in fig .",

    ", there is a small but clear improvement in the scaling of the inverse exit times when scaled by the multifractal predictions .    before concluding this section we note that the exit time statistics can be used to measure the largest lyapunov exponent in the flow",
    "this is because for small thresholds , @xmath79 , the mean exit time probes the exponential growth of the separation distances .",
    "the exact relation between the finite size lyapunov exponent and the mean exit time is @xcite @xmath115 in fig .",
    "[ fig : lyapunov ] we show the right hand side of ( [ eq : lyapunov ] ) for three different reynolds numbers ( two from this numerical simulation , see table 1 ) and one from a previous dns study @xcite , at different thresholds , @xmath79 .",

    "the relative velocity statistics are of interest because they provide information on the rate of separation of the particle pairs .",
    "we consider the statistics of the relative velocity projected in the direction of the separation vector , the longitudinal component , and the projection of the relative velocity orthogonal to the separation , the transverse component .",
    "the former is given by @xmath119 where @xmath120 .",
    "the transverse component of the relative velocity is given by @xmath121 there are , of course , two transverse components of the relative velocity but since the turbulence is isotropic it suffices to consider only one .",

    "the pdf is negatively skewed at @xmath49 ( not shown ) , corresponding to the eulerian distribution , but as @xmath43 increases , it quickly becomes positively skewed indicating that pairs with small initial separation are more likely to be diverging than converging .",
