    "a random walk  a process of making a random choice among multiple paths  naturally arises in numerous situations .",
    "it not only provides an important conceptual basis in statistics @xcite , but also has a wide range of applications in various areas of physics @xcite , computer science @xcite , and biology @xcite .",
    "its quantum mechanical analog , i.e. , quantum walk ( qw ) , was also proposed by aharonov _",
    "as the qw draws on the principle of superposition , it can remarkably manifest a variety of novel features via quantum coherence beyond the classical random walk ( crw ) .",
    "for instance , the diffusion @xmath0 of the quantum walker is much faster scaling as @xmath1 unlike the case of classical walker @xmath2 , where @xmath3 represents the number of random steps . it can find a number of applications including fast search algorithms @xcite , graph isomorphism test @xcite , and boson sampling @xcite .",
    "qw was also proposed as a primitive for universal quantum computation @xcite and as a tool to simulate quantum dynamics @xcite . just as cellular automata can be adopted to simulate , and thus understand better , various dynamical systems @xcite",
    ", qw can provide a crucial tool as a quantum cellular automaton to address quantum dynamical systems @xcite .",
    "qw has been experimentally implemented in a number of physical systems including neutral atoms in optical lattice @xcite , trapped ions @xcite , and photons @xcite , extending to multiparticle @xcite and multidimensional cases @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we explore a possibility of exploiting qw to a larger extent , i.e. , to use qw as a simulator of _ nonlinear _ quantum dynamics , thus demonstrating a much enhanced applicability of qw beyond the existing level .",
    "it is well understood that a nonlinearity can be implemented onto a dynamical system , e.g. , by a measurement - based feedforward scheme , which affects the evolution of a quantum system conditioned on the measurement outcome at previous steps .",
    "recently , shikano _ et al .",
    "_ studied a nonlinear qw via feed - forward scheme @xcite , where the investigation was , however , limited to the emergence of anomalous slow diffusion of qw scaling as @xmath4 .",
    "in contrast , we show here that there exist a wider range of applications of nonlinear qw and illustrate that it can be used to simulate the dynamics of nonlinear dirac particles .",
    "while many studies in linear qw so far focused on the diffusive dynamics leading to delocalized wave function , we here demonstrate a solitonic behavior of nonlinear dirac particle and even the coherent collisions of solitons manifesting the quantum nature of coherence . furthermore",
    ", we also demonstrate that the diffusion speed of quantum walker can be widely tunable in the framework of nonlinear qw .",
    "we anticipate that a richer set of dynamical features can also emerge in a multidimensional nonlinear qw .",
    "several works so far considered qw to emulate a relativistic fermion like a free dirac particle @xcite , which we brifely review here .",
    "we only consider 1 + 1-dimensional ( one temporal and one spatial ) dirac equation ( de ) , while 1 + 3-dimensional de can also be effectively simulated on the qw platform @xcite .",
    "a 1 + 1 dimensional de can be written as @xmath5 where @xmath6 and the exact form of dirac matrices @xmath7 is shown later .",
    "we take @xmath8 and the de can be put in the hamiltonian form as @xmath9 where the hermitian matrices @xmath10 and @xmath11 must satisfy @xmath12    the dynamics of de can be efficiently realized on a qw platform , which consists of two operations , coin - flipping and shift . a coin operator coherently mixes a walker s internal states , e.g. , spin up ( @xmath13 ) and down ( @xmath14 ) states for a two - dimensional case .",
    "a general form of a two - dimensional coin operator is the su(2 ) operator and it suffices here to employ its simple form as @xmath15 a shift operator moves a walker by one step left or right in position space according to its internal state @xmath16 .\\ ] ] if we define a displacement operator using momentum @xmath17 as @xmath18 , the shift operator has the matrix representation in coin space as @xmath19 .",
    "thus , the dynamics of a walker is determined by the combined evolution @xmath20 where the subscript @xmath21 refers to linear qw .",
    "if we represent the state of a walker at time @xmath3 as @xmath22 \\equiv \\sum_{x } { \\left\\vertx\\right\\rangle } \\otimes { \\begin{bmatrix } u(t , x ) \\\\",
    "v(t , x ) \\end{bmatrix } } , \\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with spin - dependent wavefunctions @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively , the state after one step through eq .",
    ", i.e. , @xmath25 , is given by the relation @xmath26 following this evolution sequentially , we obtain a state at time @xmath27 from an initial state @xmath28 as @xmath29 .",
    "mapping of discrete qw onto de have been considered , e.g. , by strauch @xcite and chandrashekar @xcite , and we adopt chandrashekar s formalism as follows .    to obtain the desired effective hamiltonian of qw , chandrashekar @xcite takes the logarithm of @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) ; i.e. , @xmath32 here @xmath33 with @xmath34 and the exact form of the matrix @xmath35 is detailed in ref . @xcite . after some algebra one can obtain the following effective hamiltonian : @xmath36 where @xmath37 are pauli matrices .",
    "the operator @xmath38 may be understood by way of exponential operators @xmath39 as @xmath40 \\nonumber\\\\ & \\approx & -i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x } \\psi ( t , x ) .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the operator @xmath39 can also be replaced by its differential form as @xmath41 we thus have the operators in approximate forms @xmath42 and @xmath43 , which is valid to the first - order in momentum operator @xmath44 . taking @xmath45 in view of lhosptial s rule , the hamiltonian of qw becomes that of a dirac particle , i.e. , @xmath46 with the identifications @xmath47 and @xmath48 note that chandrashekar s approach takes @xmath49 , but we find that the parametrization @xmath50 gives better results .",
    "it is readily seen that the operators in eq .",
    "satisfy the conditions in eq .",
    "required for the dynamics of dirac particle .",
    "we here move forward to address a possibility of simulating a _ nonlinear _ dirac particle on the qw platform .",
    "nonlinear dirac equation ( nde ) is regarded as a model describing extended particles without invoking quantization or intermediate bosons ( gluon ) mediating strong force as in the quark - gluon model of quantum chromodynamics @xcite . in particular , nde can well describe hadrons as its particlelike solutions and strong interactions by means of nonlinear self - coupling .",
    "just like other nonlinear equations that can have a solitonic solution , nde also allows solitary - wave ( or particlelike ) solutions  stable localized solutions with finite energy and charge  and those can be boosted to have an arbitrary velocity and remain particlelike even after collision with each other .",
    "there are various ndes classified according to interaction and topological types .",
    "we here consider nontopological scalar and vector - type interactions , i.e. , massive gross - neveu model @xcite and thirring model @xcite .",
    "the exact analytical solutions for these models are known @xcite , which can be used to test our discrete - time qw framework as an nde simulator .",
    "let us begin with lagrangian density with a generic nonlinear self - coupling term as @xmath51   - m c^2 \\bar{\\psi } \\psi   + g ( \\bar{\\psi } \\gamma \\psi ) , \\label{eq : lagrangedensity}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 and @xmath53 is a real - valued function with @xmath54 .",
    "the matrix @xmath55 determines the type of interaction , i.e. , @xmath56 for scalar ( vector ) type . for brevity ,",
    "let us adopt the representation of the @xmath57 matrices as @xmath58 we later transform by rotation the above matrices so that they match the specific form in eq . .",
    "we obtain the equations of motion from the lagrange density in eq .",
    "as @xmath59 which , for the specific case of @xmath60 , i.e. , gross - neveu and thirring model , is reduced to a hamiltonian form @xmath61 \\psi .",
    "\\label{eq : h_nl}\\ ] ] here , the state - dependent nonlinear part @xmath62 becomes @xmath63 for scalar - type interaction ( gross - neveu model ) and @xmath64 for vector type ( thirring model ) , respectively .    now seeking stationary solutions of the form @xmath65 particularly a real solution for position dependent part , one obtains @xcite    @xmath66    [ eq : stationary_sol ]    where @xmath67 , and the ``  '' ( `` + '' ) sign in eq .",
    "corresponds to the scalar ( vector ) type interaction . for completeness ,",
    "an analytical solution for pseudoscalar - type interaction @xmath68 @xcite appears as @xmath69 with @xmath70 being the same form as eq . .",
    "however , it is not normalizable and presumably not feasible in our setup , so we do not consider it here .",
    "we may define the _ charge _ as @xmath71 which is reduced to @xmath72 and @xmath73 for scalar and vector interactions , respectively @xcite .",
    "interestingly , although the model describes a quantum particle , its main features can be simulated with classical light . using polarized light beams ( walker ) , wave plates ( coin operator ) , and polarized beam splitters ( shift operator )",
    ", one can realize a qw in an optical system .",
    "in addition to this linear qw scheme , shikano _ et al . _",
    "@xcite recently studied the case of including an intensity measurement between polarized beam splitters ( pbss ) and wave plates ( wps ) .",
    "conditioned on the measured intensity , the angle parameters of the next - step wps may be adjusted , i.e. , the subsequent coin operators depend on the previous measurement outcomes . as a result",
    ", they obtained a specific nonlinear equation for qw , i.e. _ porous medium equation _ , @xmath74 they investigated an angle control scheme to result in @xmath75 , showing an anomalous diffusion @xmath76 .    in our scheme ,",
    "slightly different from the one in ref .",
    "@xcite , we instead control _ additional _ wps ( scalar - type ) or phase shifters ( vector - type ) conditioned on the measured intensity , which are placed between the previous - step pbss and the next - step wps in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] . we measure the coin - state - dependent intensities @xmath77 and @xmath78 at each localtion @xmath79 , as we need information on @xmath80 @xmath81 for a scalar ( vector)-type interaction . the coin angle in ordinary wps",
    "must not be changed for the particle mass @xmath82 and matrix @xmath83 as shown in eqs . and . as a result",
    ", we obtain a _ nonlinear _ evolution operator by including @xmath84 [ eqs . and ] after the linear evolution @xmath85 [ eqs . and",

    "in order to realize the above evolution on the optical setup in fig . [",
    "fig : setup ] , the value of @xmath88 in @xmath89 is sampled at each position @xmath79 and used to compute @xmath90 . accordingly , eq . is modified to @xmath91 } \\hat c { \\begin{bmatrix } u(t , x ) \\\\",

    "we are now in a position to test if our nqw system can actually manifest a solitonic behavior , i.e. , permanent particlelike stationary state . to address this issue , we examine if the stationary solutions known for ndes are stationary on our discrete - time nqw platform as well .",
    "we thus prepare an initial state as @xmath94 where the values of @xmath95 and @xmath70 from eq .",
    "are sampled at discrete @xmath96 .",
    "note that the rotation matrix @xmath97 , with @xmath98 the rotation about @xmath99 axis , transforms the matrices @xmath100 in eq . to those in eq . .",
    "we compute the evolution of @xmath101 according to eq . and in fig .",
    "[ fig : soliton](a ) , we display its charge @xmath102 ( intensity in an optical setup ) with respect to time and position for the case of scalar - type evolution .",
    "the evolution of vector - type case is similar , thus not shown here .",
    "the self - coupling constant @xmath103 is set to unity and the energy @xmath104 to @xmath105 , so that the inverse width @xmath106 is small and consequently the profile has a modest width .",
    "figure [ fig : soliton ] shows that the charge never escapes from a finite region and the profile keeps almost the initial shape in a stable manner .",
    "this dynamic stability or robustness is a well - known solitonic behavior , which was discussed for nde @xcite .",
    "we thus confirm that even though the initial states above are not analytical stationary solutions in our nqw model , they definitely show a solitary and stable solitonic behavior with no transport . in a qw system",
    ", localization can also be induced , e.g. , by a spatial _ disorder _ as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite . however , the localization in our case has a different physical origin , i.e. , nonlinear self - interaction here indicated as an alternative localization mechanism .",
    "one of the salient features of a soliton  and sometimes considered one of its requisites to be so called @xcite  is that its particlelike amplitude profile be maintained even after colliding with another soliton .",
    "a dirac soliton also has this unique property @xcite and our nqw platform can successfully demonstrate this feature as well . to investigate this solitonic collision ,",
    "we must be equipped with the wave function of a _ moving _ dirac soliton .",
    "we make use of the fact that a moving solution of eq . can be obtained by boosting a stationary solution in eq . with lorentz transformations @xmath107 and @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the lorentz factor . a relevant transformation matrix @xmath110 is given @xcite by @xmath111 which gives the transformation of the wave function @xmath112 .",
    "therefore , a traveling solution @xmath113 with a velocity @xmath114 is obtained from a stationary one @xmath115 by @xmath116 we have checked that the velocity @xmath114 in our nqw system is allowed up to @xmath117 . beyond those values , the states in eq . become unstable and",
    "can not maintain a sole peak profile .",
    "we study collisional phenomena of two ( or more ) dirac solitons by superposing oppositely moving solitons , i.e. , an initial state @xmath118 in fig .",
    "[ fig : soliton](b ) , we plot the time evolution of @xmath119 ( @xmath120 , @xmath121 , and @xmath122 . ) for a scalar - type collision .",
    "the two peaks representing independent solitons emerge again after transient behavior and stabilize into almost the same shapes as the original ones , implying the maintenance of quantum coherence in our nqw framework .",
    "we have so far demonstrated that our nqw scheme can provide a good simulation platform for a nonlinear dirac particle .",
    "nqw can give a deep insight into nonlinear quantum dynamics and also be further used for other practical applications .",
    "we here manifest one such interesting aspect of nqw , i.e. , observation of a wide range of ballistic diffusion speed . depending on interaction type and initial condition , the ballistic speed can be significantly varied .",
    "that is , the particlelike behavior can speed up or slow down the spread of wave amplitude in a wide scope .",
    "figure [ fig : diff_speed ] shows the time evolution of an initial state @xmath123 , with the result for the coin state @xmath124 ( @xmath125 ) shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : diff_speed](a ) and [ fig : diff_speed](b ) [ [ fig : diff_speed](c ) and [ fig : diff_speed](d ) ] sampled at @xmath126 . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : diff_speed](a ) , the case of initial coin state @xmath127 is contrasted with linear qw case ( the gray plot in the figure ) .",
    "although some portions travel away , the charge is mostly concentrated in a certain finite region  in particular , around the origin in the case of scalar type .",
    "this is owing to the localization property induced by self - interaction and accordingly the diffusion @xmath128 has a lower value for both interaction types than that of linear qw .",
    "notice , however , that its ballistic behavior does not change but only does its subsequent diffusion speed [ fig . [ fig : diff_speed](b ) ] . on the other hand , with a modification in the coin configuration ,",
    "the state @xmath129 shows dramatically different behaviors from @xmath127 .",
    "first , while @xmath127 shows no appreciable difference between scalar and vector - type interactions , @xmath129 gives very dissimilar ballistic behaviors depending on interaction types .",
    "that is , whereas much charge of the vector - type still resides at the origin , most charge of the scalar - type travels away from the origin .",
    "second , related to this difference in spatial distribution , there is a considerable distinction in the diffusion speed between the two interaction types .",
    "whereas the scalar - type walker exhibits an enhanced ballistic behavior , i.e. , large value of @xmath130 , the vector type exhibits a suppressed ballistic behavior as its value of @xmath130 is even smaller than that of linear qw .",
    "notice that even though the fronts of charge  the leading part of traveling wave  almost coincide for scalar - type nqw and linear qw cases , the solitonic feature enables the scalar type to have a larger ballistic speed .    for other evidence of wide range @xmath128",
    ", we have picked 12,482 samples of initial states of the form @xmath131 $ ] for @xmath132 $ ] , @xmath133 $ ] with spacing 0.04 ( rad ) each and evaluated their ballistic diffusion speeds @xmath130 after 200 steps .",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : diff_speed](e ) the values of @xmath130 for linear",
    "qw , scalar - type nqw , and vector - type nqw , respectively .",
    "here we have realigned the data sets in ascending order of @xmath130 of linear qw .",
    "we see a drastic variation of the ballistic speed of the two interaction types of nqw .",
    "vector - type nqw has a larger speed than the linear qw in some cases but has an upper bound of @xmath1340.43 in the whole cases . in most cases",
    ", it thus has a smaller speed than linear qw .",
    "in contrast , the scalar - type nqw shows a wide range of the speed values so that just by changing an initial coin state it can have either a larger or smaller speed than each value of linear qw .",
    "we showed that nqw is capable of simulating dynamics of nonlinear quantum models .",
    "we considered two kinds of nonlinear dirac equations and observed solitonic behavior in both situations .",
    "since nqw can be implemented in laboratories with present optical setups , our model provides a new tool to study solitons in physical systems . moreover ,",
    "formation of solitons leads to a completely new form of localization that has not been observed in quantum walk models before .",
    "finally , we showed that nonlinearity offers a new method to control the spread of the quantum walker , making both enhancement and suppression of ballistic spreading possible .",
    "the control of the spread is achieved by a proper choice of the initial state of the coin degree of freedom .    apart from the various applications mentioned above , nonlinear phenomena play a crucial role in the emergence of complexity @xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to investigate relatively simple models exhibiting such nonlinear behavior to achieve a deeper understanding of nonlinear physics .",
    "qws are already known to be able to simulate various physical systems and it is natural to expect that the nqw model presented in this work can find applications in studies related to quantum complexity .",
