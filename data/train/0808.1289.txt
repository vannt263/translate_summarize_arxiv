    "[ fig2 ]    in this review i summarize highlights from _ spitzer _ secondary eclipse measurements , with some discussion of transmission spectroscopy during transit .",
    "the quality of work in this field has been uniformly high , but i will summarize the results from the viewpoint of what is robust , and what i believe needs more work and clarification .",
    "the depth of a planetary eclipse measures the brightness of the planet at that wavelength , in units of the stellar brightness . combining results from multiple eclipses at different wavelengths allows us to reconstruct the spectral energy distribution of the planet at photometric spectral resolution ( typically , @xmath3 ) .",
    "the results are usually shown in ` contrast ' units , i.e. , planet divided by star , since that is what we actually measure .",
    "the contrast amplitude of exoplanet eclipses is greatest at the longest wavelengths . in the rayleigh - jeans limit ,",
    "the eclipse amplitude ( @xmath4 ) is ( charbonneau 2003 ) : @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the ratio of planet - to - star area , and @xmath7 is the ratio of planet - to - star brightness temperature . assuming that the planet and star resemble blackbodies ( a reasonable approximation at the longest wavelengths ) , then : @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the angular diameter of the star as seen from the planet , and @xmath10 is a constant that contains the planet s albedo , circulation properties , etc",
    ". an important corollary of eqs .",
    "2.1 and 2.2 is the effect of smaller parent stars ( e.g. , m - dwarfs ) .",
    "as we proceed down the main sequence , @xmath11 and @xmath9 decrease , but the exponents imply that the @xmath6 term dominates over @xmath12 . hence planets orbiting small stars will generally exhibit deeper eclipses , and their emergent flux will be more detectable for that reason . moreover , the habitable zone moves closer to lower main sequence stars , and the transit probability increases inversely as the planet s orbit radius .",
    "this circumstance is a major impetus for finding terrestrial planets in the habitable zones of m - dwarfs ( charbonneau and deming , 2007 ) .",
    "the time of the secondary eclipse is very sensitive to the eccentricity of the orbit , specifically to @xmath13 ( charbonneau 2003 ) .",
    "for example , the eclipse of gj436b occurs at phase @xmath14 ( deming et al .",
    "2007 ) , more than five hours after the mid - point between transits .",
    "since the eclipse duration is @xmath151-hour , the sensitivity of the eclipse time to moderately small eccentricity ( @xmath16 for gj436b ) is obvious .",
    "the actual flux from close - in planets will peak near 2 to 5@xmath0 m , not at the wavelengths of greatest contrast .",
    "moreover , the shorter infrared ( ir ) wavelengths are key to inferring the composition and temperature structure of the planet s atmosphere .",
    "figure  3 shows the spectrum of hd189733b , in flux ( not contrast ) units , from barman ( 2008 ) .",
    "the ir spectra of hot jupiters are believed to be shaped predominantly by water absorption ( burrows et al .",
    "2005 , seager et al .",
    "2005 ) , but other molecules such as methane also play a role ( e.g. , swain et al .",
    "2008a ) , and methane in particular could become more important for cooler planets like gj436b .",
    "for close - in planets orbiting luminous stars , strong irradiation could flatten the temperature gradient and weaken absorption features in the spectrum at the time of eclipse ( fortney et al .",
    "_ spitzer _ results from spectroscopy initially suggested that water absorption might not be a prominent feature in eclipse spectra ( grillmair et al .",
    "2007 , richardson et al 2007 , see discussion below ) . however , the hd189733b results from irac ( charbonneau et al .",
    "2008 ) are in good accord with barman s standard model , and provide convincing evidence that water absorption shapes the 2- to 5@xmath0 m spectra of at least one hot jupiter .",

    "ehrenreich et al . (",
    "2007 ) have suggested that better correction for instrument systematics is needed before we can conclude that water absorption is detected via irac photometry during transit .",
    "while i believe there is good evidence for water absorption in transit , additional work to better understand _",
    "spitzer s _ instrumental systematics is certainly warranted .",
    "hot jupiters are believed to rotate synchronously with their orbital period , keeping one side perpetually pointed toward the star .",
    "an important question is the degree to which they transport heat to the anti - stellar hemisphere via strong atmospheric circulation .",
    "models of this circulation ( e.g. , showman & guillot 2002 , cho et al .",
    "2003 , 2008 , cooper and showman 2006 , langton and laughlin 2008 ) can be checked using _ spitzer _ around - the - orbit observations , either made continuously ( knutson et al . 2007 ) , or via periodic sampling ( harrington et al .",

    "observations of two non - transiting hot jupiters , ups andb at 24@xmath0 m ( harrington et al .",
    "2006 ) and hd179949b at 8@xmath0 m ( cowan et al . 2007 ) suggested large day - to - night temperature contrasts .",
    "other planets give much lower day - night contrast ( knutson et al .",
    "2007 , cowan et al . 2007 ) .",
    "one possibility is that the difference for ups andb is related to the greater formation height of 24@xmath0 m radiation .",
    "but note that knutson et al .",
    "( 2008a ) have observed hd189733b at 24@xmath0 m , and find a result commensurate with their 8@xmath0 m results .",
    "another possibility is that these type of phased observations could be affected by a temporary ` hot spot ' , and would not typically show such a large day - night difference .",
    "however , in that case we would also expect greater - than - predicted variability at secondary eclipse for some transiting planets , and even low - level variability has not yet been observed . _ spitzer _ will re - observe ups andb at 24@xmath0 m ( b. hansen , private communication ) if the cryogen lasts long enough .",
    "in addition to close - in planets on circular orbits , _ spitzer _ has great potential to observe the time - dependent heating ( iro & deming 2008 ) for planets on very elliptic orbits .",
    "recently , laughlin et al . (",
    "2008 ) observed the flash - heating of hd80606b at periastron , and _",
    "spitzer _ may be able to make more observations of this type during the warm mission .      although hd189733b shows water absorption , and agrees well with standard models , there is evidence that other exoplanets show different atmospheric structures .",
    "hd209458b exhibits an atmospheric temperature inversion ( i.e. , temperature rises with increasing height ) .",
    "the first hint of this inversion was found by richardson et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , who derived emission features in their eclipse spectrum at relatively ` high ' spectral resolution @xmath17 , albeit at low signal - to - noise .",
    "definitive evidence of the inversion comes from the irac eclipse measurements by knutson et al .",

    "in comparing the observations and models on figure  4 , i ve scaled the models by an arbitrary contrast factor to produce the best fit by eye .",
    "this serves to illustrate the nature of these two different exoplanet spectra , but i caution that for the quantitative fits , readers should consult the original papers .",
    ".,width=288 ]    in addition to irac , _ spitzer _ eclipse observations of both planets have been obtained at 16@xmath0 m and 24@xmath0 m ( not plotted ) .",
    "these longer wavelengths are also sensitive to water absorption and atmospheric temperature gradients , but less so than at irac wavelengths .",
    "when comparing spectral energy distributions for different planets , remember that all four irac wavelengths were observed simultaneously only for hd189733b and hd209458b .",
    "more commonly , due to the nature of the instrument ( fazio et al .",
    "2005 ) , eclipses are measured at 3.6 and 5.8@xmath0 m simultaneously , and then in another eclipse at 4.5 and 8@xmath0 m simultaneously . in principle , variability of the planet s thermal emission ( rauscher et al .",
    "2007 ) could contaminate the measured spectrum . to date",
    ", there is no evidence for variability large enough to produce significant spectrum errors ( see agol et al .",
    "2008 ) .    the hallmark of an inverted spectrum can be seen by comparing 5.8 and 8.0@xmath0 m measurements , as well as comparing 3.6 and 4.5@xmath0 m .",
    "the inverted atmosphere has a higher 5.8@xmath0 m flux than 8.0@xmath0 m , because 5.8@xmath0 m has high opacity due to water vapor , and the water bands are present in emission . in the non - inverted atmosphere the 3.6@xmath0 m flux",
    "is elevated because the lesser opacity at this wavelength allows planet flux to well up from the deeper atmosphere , where temperatures are higher .",
    "the non - inverted 4.5@xmath0 m band shows lower flux because water and co opacity cause the radiation to be emitted from higher layers of the atmosphere , where the temperature is lower .",
    "the inverted atmosphere may have a high altitude absorbing layer ( burrows et al .",
    "2008 ) , and this raises the temperature at the 4.5@xmath0 m height , and lowers it at the 3.6@xmath0 m height , reversing the relative magnitudes of the emergent fluxes .",
    "an open question is the physical cause of the inversion , and whether this is a common phenomenon in hot jupiter atmospheres .",
    "burrows et al .",
    "( 2008 ) attribute the inversion to the presence of a high altitude optical absorbing layer , but the composition and origin of this layer are unknown .",
    "doubtless the high level of stellar irradiation that hot jupiters experience plays a major role in inverting the temperature gradient .",
    "fortney et al . ( 2008 ) define two classes of hot jupiters depending on whether the stellar irradiation drives the formation of a hot stratosphere ( i.e. , region of higher temperature ) via tio / vo absorption .",
    "tio and vo have bands in the optical where stellar fluxes are high , and have been implicated in perturbations to exoplanet atmospheric temperature structure ( hubeny et al .",
    "figure  5 shows many of the known exoplanets in mass vs. irradiance space , with the predicted boundary between the pm class ( stratospheres ) and pl class ( no stratospheres ) indicated .",
    "i have circled the three planets that are known or strongly suspected to have inverted temperature gradients . besides hd209458b , hd149026b is believed to have a hot stratosphere on the basis of the very high brightness temperature at 8@xmath0 m ( harrington et al . 2007 ) .",
    "recently , xo-1b was found to have an inverted gradient ( machalek et al .",
    "although xo-1b is predicted to be pl class , it is at the upper range of that class , so there is no firm counterexample to the fortney et al .",

    "_ spitzer _ secondary eclipse observations have been extended to spectroscopy as well as photometry ( grillmair et al .",
    "2007 , richardson et al . 2007 , swain et al .",
    "the principle of these measurements is simple .",
    "suppose that an absorption ( emission ) feature occurs in the planets atmosphere at a given wavelength .",
    "then the depth of the eclipse at that wavelength will be smaller ( larger ) than at other wavelengths .",
    "hence the emergent spectrum of the planet can be constructed from the wavelength dependence of the eclipse depth . in practice , this is a much more difficult observation than _ spitzer _ photometry , for two reasons .",
    "first , there are many fewer photons per wavelength channel because the light is dispersed , so the signal - to - noise ratio is lower than for photometry .",
    "second , spectroscopy is more affected by instrument systematic effects , as discussed below . in spite of these difficulties ,",
    "the results are of great interest .",
    "two exoplanets are sufficiently bright to make _ spitzer _ spectroscopy practical : hd189733b ( grillmair et al .",

    "( 2007 ) concluded that the spectrum of hd209458b contained two discrete features , both present in emission .",
    "near 9.8@xmath0 m they found evidence for a relatively broad emission bump that they attributed to the si - o stretching resonance , and at 7.78@xmath0 m they find a sharp emission feature that may be due to a c - c stretching resonance . to illustrate these results , i ve re - analyzed the richardson et al .",
    "data , using a similar method , and this result is shown in figure  7 .",
    "these data have also been analyzed by swain et al .",
    "( 2008b ) , using an entirely different method .",
    "swain et al .",
    "find emission near 7.8@xmath0 m , but not at 9.8@xmath0 m .",
    "this difference in results seems consistent with the nature of the systematic effects in the irs instrument : broad features ( 9.8@xmath0 m ) are more sensitive to the way the instrument systematics are treated in the analysis , whereas sharp features ( 7.8@xmath0 m ) are insensitive to the analysis method .",
    "it is important to optimize the spectroscopic eclipse technique , so that we can use it with jwst to measure the spectra of potentially habitable planets transiting m - dwarfs ( charbonneau and deming , 2007 ) .",
    "_ spitzer _ observations have proven to be a remarkably stable and sensitive way to measure exoplanet thermal emission . _",
    "spitzer _ exoplanet aperture photometry ( for @xmath22 m ) achieves noise levels closely approaching the photon noise limit , and the errors average down as the inverse square root of exposure time . for the longer _",
    "wavelengths , where the zodiacal thermal background is significant , the most precise photometry often requires psf - weighted optimal photometry , depending on the brightness of the star . unlike ground - based photometry , it is generally _ not _ necessary to use ` comparison stars ' with _",
    "spitzer_. in fact , it can even be detrimental to rely on comparison stars , because _",
    "spitzer _ does have instrument systematic effects that could vary with position on the detector .",
    "there are several effects that are currently recognized and accounted for in _ spitzer _ analyses , and most of them are now described in the _ spitzer _ instrument documentation .",
    "the ones most relevant to exoplanet eclipses are :    _ the ramp_. photometry at 8- and 16@xmath0 m exhibits a gradually increasing intensity , equivalent to an increasing gain in the instrument response .",
    "this apparent gain increase is flux - dependent : bright sources reach maxmium intensity more rapidly than faint sources .",
    "this so - called ` ramp ' ( deming et al .",
    "2006 ) is obvious in the top panel of figure  6 .",
    "knutson et al . ( 2007 ) hypothesize that it is due to charge - trapping , which is ( so far ) the most promising hypothesis .",
    "note that the ramp is _ not _ simply due to build - up of a latent image , since none is present when the telescope is nodded ( deming et al .",
    "2006 ) . in the charge - trapping hypothesis ,",
    "the first electrons generated by photons are captured by ionized impurites in the detector material , and do not contribute to the signal on the observed time scale . as the detector is exposed to additional radiation ,",
    "the charge traps saturate , and the signal readout reaches an asymptotic level .",
    "this explanation is broadly consistent with the known characteristics of the ramp , with some exceptions .",
    "observations at 5.8@xmath0 m can exhibit a ` negative ' ramp , i.e. a decreasing intensity with time ( machalek et al .",
    "2008 ) , and no ramp is seen in 24@xmath0 m photometry ( knutson and charbonneau , private communication ) .",
    "the existence of decreasing , as well as increasing , ramps suggests a complex phenomenon that may depend on the gate and bias voltages applied to the detector .",
    "the lack of a ramp at 24@xmath0 m may be due to the fact that the relatively large zodiacal background at this wavelength keeps the ramp perpetually at its maximum value , but the zodiacal background is also strong for 16@xmath0 m photometry , which does exhibit a prominent ramp ( deming et al .",
    "spectroscopy using irs also exhibits a ramp , at least when obtaining spectroscopy at 7 - 14@xmath0 m ( richardson et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "the ramp is a relatively benign effect for eclipse photometry of bright and high - contrast systems .",
    "the time scale for the ramp to reach its maximum value is significantly longer than the duration of an eclipse , so it s essentially a baseline effect that is included when fitting to the eclipse depth . but",
    "the ramp is more problematic for fainter and low - contrast systems because small uncertainties in the ramp curvature become significant relative to the eclipse depth .",
    "the ramp is also problematic for ` around - the - orbit ' observations where the planet signal will vary on a longer time scale .",
    "one promising approach for this type of observation is to ` pre - flash ' the detector by exposing it to a bright source immediately prior to the exoplanet observations .",
    "this saturates the ramp before the exoplanet is observed ; preliminary examination of observations using a pre - flash ( h. knutson , private communication ) suggest that the technique is largely successful .",
    "_ pixel phase_. the pixels in the irac detectors are more responsive when stellar images are centered on the pixels than when they lie near the edges , and this is called the pixel phase effect .",
    "one exception to this is very bright stars that are near saturation .",
    "detector non - linearity can produce a lower signal when very bright stars are centered on a given pixel , but this circumstance is normally avoided by using shorter integration times .",
    "the pixel phase effect is ubiquitous in the 3.6 and 4.5@xmath0 m channels of irac , and may be present to a much lesser degree at 5.8- and 8@xmath0 m .",
    "because there is pointing jitter in the telescope ( @xmath15 tens of milli - arcsec ) , the pixel phase effect leads to a variable intensity when performing aperture photometry .",
    "this is corrected in eclipse data by decorrelating the intensity versus distance from pixel center ( e.g. , charbonneau et al .",
    "2005 , 2008 ) .",
    "pixel phase is also normally decorrelated from photometry performed for other _",
    "research ( morales - calderon et al .",
    "2006 ) , not just exoplanet photometry .",
    "_ spectroscopic slit losses_. the irs spectrometer ( houck et al .",
    "2005 ) has light losses at its entrance slit , like most astronomical slit spectrometers .",
    "diffraction causes stellar images at the slit to increase in size proportional to wavelength , so the slit losses increase with wavelength also . because there is telescope pointing jitter on a time scale of @xmath23hour , and possibly on longer times scales , the intensity in a stellar spectrum will vary slightly with both wavelength and time .",
    "even a slight variation in the measured stellar spectrum distorts the spectra that are inferred for exoplanets using the eclipse technique .",
    "there is no robust and independent method to ascertain the exact telescope pointing for a given spectrum .",
    "hence exoplanet observers correct for this distortion in different ways ( richardson et al .",
    "2007 , swain et al .",
    "because the effect varies slowly with wavelength , it primarily affects broad features in exoplanet spectra , not sharp features like the 7.8@xmath0 m emission inferred in hd209458b ( richardson et al .",
    "2007 , and figure 7 ) .",
    "hence the appearance of broad features ( like the 9.8@xmath0 m peak on figure 7 ) , and indeed their reality in exoplanet spectra , can depend on the method used to analyze the data .",
    "sharp features should be robust against instrument systematics , but i note that the 7.8@xmath0 m feature has relatively low signal - to - noise .",
    "the depletion of cryogen ( in @xmath15 april 2009 ) will terminate the cold portion of the _ spitzer _ mission .",
    "however , the 3.6 and 4.5@xmath0 m channels of irac will still operate at full sensitivity , because the observatory will remain radiatively cooled at @xmath24k . the requirement to operate the ` warm ' mission at low cost dictates that operations must be simple .",
    "this favors relatively large programs , and exoplanet transit and eclipse science is poised to take full advantage of _",
