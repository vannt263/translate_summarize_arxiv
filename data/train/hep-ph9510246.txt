    "<S> historically , this was first phrased as a prediction of @xmath13 based on the measured value of @xmath14 , whose qualitative agreement with early electroweak data was impressive , particularly for supersymmetric guts @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the advent of precision electroweak data from lep and elsewhere @xcite , and the measurement of the top - quark mass @xmath15 @xcite has enabled @xmath13 to be determined with such accuracy that it is natural to turn the gut correlation round the other way , and use it to predict @xmath0 , which is still not known with satisfactory precision @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the prediction of a minimal non - supersymmetric su(5 ) gut is disastrously low , and debate centres on the the possibility of discriminating between different supersymmetric guts and/or obtaining indirect constraints on the scale of supersymmetry breaking . </S>",
    "<S> + progress on these questions is hampered by the persistent imprecision in the experimental value of @xmath0 , which is usually quoted as @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> most determinations lie within one standard deviation of this mean , but this consistency hides two schools of thought : one supported more strongly by high - energy determinations of @xmath14 which favour @xmath17 @xcite , and one favoured more strongly by low - energy determinations of @xmath14 which favour @xmath18 when evolved up to a higher scale @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is not clear whether this apparent discrepancy is real , but it has led to various supersymmetric speculations , including the possibility that gluinos are sufficiently light to alter the evolution of @xmath14 between low energies and @xmath19 @xcite , or that radiative corrections due to other light sparticles such as the chargino and top - squark reduce the value of @xmath0 inferred from lep data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + the minimal supersymmetric su(5 ) prediction of @xmath0 definitely lies on the upper side of the experimental range , and even above it , with values around @xmath20 or higher being preferred @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this preference should however be treated with caution , as the predicted value may be reduced by gut threshold effects @xcite or by ` slop ' induced by planck - scale interactions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one example of a supersymmetric gut which makes a lower prediction for @xmath0 is the missing - doublet model ( mdm ) @xcite , in which the gut threshold corrections are generally negative @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the mdm is quite cumbersome , containing several large higgs representations that can not easily be accommodated in a string framework @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + by far </S>",
    "<S> the most economical realization of the missing - partner mechanism is that in flipped su(5 ) @xcite , which needs only and representations of gut higgses and has been derived from string @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this model also provides another natural mechanism for reducing the prediction for @xmath0 , namely if the scale at which @xmath14 and the su(2 ) electroweak coupling become equal is lower than the scale at which the su(5 ) and u(1 ) couplings become equal @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + in this paper we make a quantitative exploration of this possibility in the supersymmetric minimal flipped su(5 ) gut @xcite . in addition to exploring the above - mentioned possible difference in unification scales , we also calculate for the first time the gut threshold effects in flipped su(5 ) , finding that they may be naturally negative . </S>",
    "<S> we also demonstrate that the flipped su(5 ) mechanism for reducing @xmath0 has an observable signature if it lies in the lower part of the range currently allowed by experiment @xcite , namely that proton decay into @xmath21 should be observable in the superkamiokande detector . </S>",
    "<S> + the starting point for our discussion is the lowest - order prediction for @xmath0 in su(5 ) guts , namely @xmath22 which yields the present central experimental value of @xmath23 for @xmath24 and @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to include two - loop corrections ( @xmath1 ) , and light ( @xmath26 ) and heavy ( @xmath3 ) threshold corrections by making the following substitution in eq .  </S>",

    "<S> , the su(5 ) prediction increases to @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , if one wishes to obtain a value of @xmath0 within one standard deviation of the present central experimental value , one requires a non - negligible contribution from @xmath26 and/or @xmath3 , so that the combined correction ( @xmath30 ) is suppressed . in large regions of parameter space , @xmath31 and does not help . as we discuss in more detail later , exploiting @xmath3 is difficult in minimal su(5 ) because of proton decay constraints @xcite , unless one goes to the limit @xmath32 and @xmath33 which suppresses proton decay . </S>",
    "<S> however , even in this case the decrease in @xmath0 is not large : @xmath34 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one way to circumvent these problems is the cumbersome missing doublet model ( mdm ) @xcite : here we take the more elegant route of flipped su(5 ) . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ eq : u(1 ) ] ) , also implies @xmath52 . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ eq : rgey ] ) : + @xmath55 which coincides with the unification scale in minimal su(5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we thus obtain a set of three equations ( [ eq : rge2],[eq : rge3],[eq : mumax ] ) involving six variables : @xmath56 and @xmath57 . solving these equations for the value of @xmath0 , the analogue of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : lo ] ) is given by @xmath58 it is clear that the prediction for @xmath0 in flipped su(5 ) is automatically smaller than in minimal su(5 ) . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ eq : lo ] ) , which would compensate for the decrease due to @xmath1 , is achieved simply by setting @xmath60 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : flo ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also note that the value of @xmath47 at @xmath35 is given by @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the maximum possible value of @xmath47 , which is that attained in the minimal su(5 ) case . </S>",
    "<S> + the above qualitative discussion shows the differences between flipped su(5 ) and minimal su(5 ) . </S>",
