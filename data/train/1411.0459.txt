    "the riemann hypothesis states that the non - trivial zeros of the riemann function , @xmath0 , have the form @xmath1 , where the @xmath2 are all real . a fascinating approach to treating the riemann problem is to consider the @xmath2 to be eigenvalues of a self - adjoint operator , since if such an operator could be identified the @xmath2 would necessarily be real .",
    "this idea , known as the plya and hilbert conjecture , is supported by numerous evidence ( see @xcite for reviews ) , notably that the zeros appear to closely follow the gue statistics @xcite of random matrix theory and quantum chaos .",
    "this unexpected connection between number theory and physics has inspired many suggestions for finding physical implementations of the riemann function , such as evaluating the fourier transform of a suitable wave using opto - mechanical means @xcite or far - field diffraction @xcite , or by measuring entanglement in quantum systems @xcite .    in this work",
    "we propose a very different approach , in which a time - periodic driving potential is used to modify the dynamics of a quantum system .",
    "as the system is periodically - driven its dynamics is not described by energy eigenvalues , but by a generalization of these quantities termed `` quasienergies '' .",
    "our central result is the construction of a driving field for which the corresponding quasienergy spectrum is given by the riemann @xmath3 function @xcite , or by a smoothed version of this function , @xmath4 , introduced by plya .",
    "this last has the appealing feature that the appropriate driving field can be expressed in a simple closed form . in both cases",
    "the zeros of the @xmath3 function correspond to degeneracies , or crossings , of the quasienergies .",
    "these are of particular physical significance because they correspond to the phenomenon known as `` coherent destruction of tunneling '' ( cdt ) in which the dynamics of the system is frozen @xcite . as an example",
    "we show how the zeros can be seen directly in cold atom experiments by measuring the expansion rate of a condensate held in a driven optical lattice .",
    "this technique thus represents a new and powerful way of finding a physical realization of the riemann function .",
    "we begin by considering a standard two - level system , driven by a time - periodic function @xmath5 @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the tunneling between the two levels .",
    "as @xmath8 is time - periodic , the natural framework to treat the problem is given by floquet theory @xcite . in this approach one",
    "seeks the eigensystem of the floquet operator @xmath9 where we have set @xmath10 .",
    "henceforth we shall also measure all energies ( and frequencies ) in units of @xmath7 .",
    "the eigenstates of @xmath11 are @xmath12-periodic functions called floquet states , and their associated eigenvalues , which play an analogous role to energy eigenvalues for the case of a static hamiltonian , are called quasienergies .",
    "the floquet states provide a complete basis , and expanding the wavefunction in these states provides similar advantages to the normal procedure of expressing a state in energy eigenstates in the undriven case .",
    "in general it is difficult to obtain analytical expressions for the floquet states . in the strong - driving limit , however , when the frequency @xmath13 is the dominant energy scale , it is possible to make an expansion by first solving just for the time - dependent component of @xmath14 , and applying the static part as perturbation @xcite . in this way one obtains a perturbative series in orders of @xmath7 .",
    "truncating at first - order gives the simple result @xmath15 , where the effective tunneling @xmath16 is given by @xmath17 and @xmath18 . the quasienergies are given simply by the eigenvalues of @xmath19 , namely @xmath20 .",
    "for the smoothed function @xmath21 ( eq.[final ] ) . for small values of @xmath22",
    "the function is quite featureless , but progressively increases in amplitude and develops more oscillations as @xmath22 increases .",
    "the corresponding driving function for @xmath23 behaves similarly ( see fig.[surface_plot].),scaledwidth=45.0% ]    from eq.[integral_eff ] it is thus straightforward to calculate the behavior of the quasienergies ( or equivalently , of the effective tunneling ) for a given driving potential @xmath8 . for the case",
    "@xmath24 , for example , this yields the well - known bessel function renormalization @xcite of tunneling @xmath25 . at zeros of the bessel function , @xmath26 , the effective tunneling vanishes , producing cdt .",
    "this effect has been measured experimentally @xcite in the dynamics of driven ultracold atoms .",
    "we need , however , to solve the _ inverse problem _ ; to find an @xmath8 that produces a given behavior of the quasienergies .",
    "we shall first explain our technique using plya s function , @xmath21 , as this gives a convenient closed - form for the solution , and then go on to consider the more complicated case of the true riemann @xmath3 function .",
    "plya s function is given by @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the modified @xmath29-bessel function , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "this is a smoothed version of the riemann @xmath3 function @xmath32 whose zeros coincide with the non - trivial zeros of @xmath0 .",
    "although as titchmarsh pointed out @xcite plya s zeta function can not truly be regarded as an approximation to @xmath23 in the most obvious sense , they do share many properties .",
    "most importantly @xmath21 has the same average distribution of zeros @xcite , following the smooth term of the riemann - mangoldt formula , and so nonetheless represents an interesting application of our method .",
    "plya further proved that the zeros of @xmath21 are real for any value of the constant @xmath33 .",

    "we show the form of @xmath8 as @xmath22 is varied .",
    "little structure is visible for @xmath49 .",
    "the reason is the rapid decrease of @xmath50 with @xmath42 , arising from the exponential term @xmath51 .",
    "indeed @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "accordingly we now set the period of the driving , and thus the cut - off in the integration in eq.[requirement ] , to be @xmath54 .",
    "we shall use this value throughout the rest of the paper . in fig.[driving]a",
    "we show the full periodic driving field , obtained by periodically repeating cycles of @xmath8 .",
    "although this form of @xmath8 indeed satisfies ( [ requirement ] ) , the driving can be made more effective by imposing a further set of conditions on it : _ i ) _ to avoid heating in the cold atom model ( see section [ bec ] ) , the average of @xmath8 over one period should vanish , _",

    "as the system is periodically - driven , the appropriate generalized parity operator involves both inversion and time - translation @xmath55 .",

    ", this plot shows a striking similarity to fig.[drive_function ] , in which the @xmath8 giving rise to @xmath21 is shown .",

    "examining the two curves in detail , reveals that although the functions share the same general form ( as seen in the similarity of the two surface plots fig.[drive_function ] and fig.[surface_plot ] ) , there are nonetheless significant small differences .",
    "these minor differences lead to the different location of zeros for @xmath23 and @xmath21 , demonstrating the well - known analytical sensitivity of the zeta function .    , that produce @xmath21 and @xmath23 look superficially very similar , they differ in details .",

    "the `` small parameter '' is @xmath76 , and so this result is only valid in the high - frequency limit @xmath77 .",
    "this would require the driving period , @xmath78 , to be small ; however this contradicts the requirement that @xmath12 be as large as possible so that the integrals ( [ requirement ] ) and ( [ require_true ] ) are well - converged . to be able to satisfy both these requirement",
    ", we therefore scale the driving as @xmath79 , where @xmath80 , while keeping @xmath81 constant .",
