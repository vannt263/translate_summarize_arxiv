    "the organic compound nicl@xmath0 - 4sc(nh@xmath0)@xmath0 ( known as dtn ) is a gapped quasi - one - dimensional antiferromagnet with easy - plane anisotropy dominating the exchange coupling . at zero temperature , dtn undergoes a phase transition at a critical field @xmath1 t above which nonzero spontaneous magnetization develops in the ground state and the spectrum of magnetic excitations becomes gapless .",
    "the system may then be thought of as a spin fluid formally described as a gas of hard - core bosons and the field - induced transition at @xmath2 corresponds to bose - einstein condensation .",
    "a further transition occurs at a second critical field @xmath3 t above which the ground state is a fully ordered ferromagnetic state .",

    "the resulting picture was found to be generally consistent with early theoretical predictions @xcite . in short , in the low - field region @xmath5 the ground state carries zero azimuthal spin ( @xmath6 ) while magnon excitations with @xmath7 are separated by a gap which is unambiguously observed in the esr spectrum through the expected @xmath8 transitions . in the high - field region , @xmath9 ,",

    "the physical picture becomes more involved in the intermediate field region @xmath11 but some progress has already been reported in recent literature @xcite .",
    "our current task is to clarify some remaining discrepancies between theory and experiment .",
    "thus we have carried out afresh a new set of esr experiments performed in a frequency range 50 - 700 ghz using a tunable - frequency submillimeter - wave esr spectrometer @xcite equipped with backward wave oscillators as radiation sources and a 25 t resistive magnet . a transmission - type probe with a sample in the faraday geometry",

    "a corollary of the preceding discussion is that @xmath39 .",
    "when the field @xmath12 exceeds its critical value @xmath2 level crossing occurs and the azimuthal spin of the ground state no longer vanishes but increases with increasing field . thus the system enters an intermediate phase through a field - induced quantum phase transition .",
    "the magnon spectrum is expected to be gapless in the intermediate phase but its detailed structure is now difficult to calculate .",
    "a systematic 1/@xmath28 expansion is not feasible while semiclassical methods are generally inaccurate at strong anisotropy .",

    "the energy - momentum dispersion of single - magnon states is then given by @xmath40 the lowest gap of this dispersion occurs at @xmath36 and is equal to @xmath41 .",
    "thus the ordered state is stable when the field exceeds a critical value given by @xmath42 therefore , for @xmath9 , the esr spectrum should be dominated by @xmath8 transitions between the completely ordered ferromagnetic state and @xmath32 magnons .",
    "the resonance frequency is then calculated from @xmath43 and is found to be independent of the exchange constants .",
    "the physical picture is actually more involved for @xmath9 thanks to the appearance of an interesting class of two - magnon bound states .",
    "an exact calculation of such states is possible in the 1d model through an elementary bethe ansatz @xcite .",
    "the two - magnon spectrum contains a `` single - ion bound state '' whose energy - momentum dispersion extends well above the two - magnon continuum and was argued to be relevant for the analysis of the esr spectrum observed in large-@xmath28 systems @xcite .",
    "however , a bethe ansatz is not applicable to the 3d model studied in this section .",
    "thus we resort to a more direct method developed long time ago by wortis @xcite for the calculation of two - magnon bound states in ferromagnets with arbitrary lattice dimension .",
    "the method is here generalized to account for easy - plane anisotropy with strength @xmath28 and is employed in conjunction with the 1/@xmath28 expansion when analytical treatment is no longer feasible .",
    "thus we were able to calculate the energy - momentum dispersion of the single - ion mode @xmath44 to third order in the 1/@xmath28 expansion .",
    "we defer for the moment discussion of a @xmath32 , @xmath10 transition between the ordered ground state and a single - ion bound state . instead , we turn our attention to @xmath8 transitions between single magnons and single - ion bound states .",

    "iii of the present paper , the intensity is expected to display a characteristic double peak as a function of frequency at fixed external field , or as a function of field at fixed frequency .",
    "therefore , both frequencies @xmath51 and @xmath52 are associated with the single - ion bound state and are relevant for the analysis of actual experiments . in this respect",
    ", it is worth mentioning that the absorption corresponding to mode g was initially observed in previous experiments @xcite . this absorption was interpreted as an artifact originating in the superficial layer of dtn crystals attacked by a ge - varnish solvent used to fix the sample within the sample holder .",
    "however , our theoretical analysis suggests that the g mode is actually an inseparable partner in a doubly - peaked fg band associated with the single - ion bound state .",
    "indeed , our current experiment supports such an interpretation , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] where the transmittance measured at fixed frequency @xmath53 ghz displays a characteristic double peak as a function of the applied field .",

    "another important feature of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] is the apparent vanishing of intensity at relatively low temperatures ( e.g. , @xmath54 k ) , an experimental fact that is consistent with our interpretation of the fg resonance band as the result of transitions between excited states ; namely , transitions between single magnons and single - ion two - magnon bound states ( fig .",

    "[ fig3a ] and further discussed in sec .",
    "finally , we return briefly to the possibility of a @xmath10 transition between the ordered ground state and a @xmath32 single - ion bound state , which would lead to a resonance frequency @xmath56 but zero intensity thanks to the axial symmetry adopted in our theoretical models . however , crystal symmetry is compatible with some deviations from strict axial symmetry which apart from a tiny field misalignment may render mode e observable . in fact , such a mode was previously observed in dtn with a sample in the voigt geometry @xcite and is included in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "the remainder of this section is devoted to a brief discussion concerning the choice of suitable parameters .",

    "[ fig1 ] , which are again in rough agreement with experiment . a schematic representation of the esr transitions that correspond to the above modes is given in fig . [ fig1a ] .",
    "in our opinion , a completely satisfactory quantitative agreement with experiment should not be expected for two reasons .",

    "nevertheless , we believe that the overall qualitative picture is substantially correct .",
    "yet there are several questions that are difficult to settle within the essentially 3d model of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , such as the calculation of intensities of the various esr modes , the structure of the spectrum in the intermediate phase , etc .",

    "[ fig4 ] which we analyse in turn :    a.   we note that the magnon resonance lines a , b and c roughly coincide with the maxima of the calculated intensity as expected in the low - temperature region . nevertheless , the chosen temperature @xmath110 k is sufficiently high to account for the anticipated line broadening which is also apparent in fig .",

    "[ fig4 ] where the intensity practically vanishes in the fg region .",
    "b.   we examine the results of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] in the intermediate region @xmath116 where analytical predictions are practically absent .",
    "the most conspicuous feature is a tail of line g with strong intensity in the intermediate region , which persists even at very low temperature where line g itself looses its intensity for @xmath114 .",
    "therefore , the g - tail corresponds to some sort of a collective excitation that is robustly present in our current experiment and requires further theoretical investigation .",
    "on the other hand , mode f acquires a tail into the intermediate region with intensity that diminishes at low temperature and is thus invisible in fig .",
    "c.   we note that the magnon lines a , b and c also acquire tails but with intensity that gradually vanishes as one approaches the center of the intermediate phase .",

    "also evident is the formation of a double peak in the fg region , with the dominant peak occurring near the g boundary while a peak of lower intensity develops near the f boundary .",
    "the relative enhancement of the intensity near the g boundary is likely due to the fact that it involves transitions between @xmath76 single magnons and @xmath76 single - ion bound states , where the magnon acquires its lowest gap and is thus more heavily populated at finite temperature than , say , @xmath79 magnons .",

    "thus most of our effort was devoted to a detailed numerical calculation of intensity within the 1d model .",
    "the main new results are the following :    while there have been numerous theoretical predictions for the occurrence of two - magnon bound states in quantum spin systems , experimental observation has been rather slow . perhaps , the most interesting feature of the esr spectrum in large-@xmath28 systems is the evidence it provides for the existence of the so - called single - ion two - magnon bound states .",

    "in fact , the g mode absorbs most of the intensity and is thus far from extraneous .",
    "this mode is especially interesting in relation to the fact that the corresponding resonance line @xmath131 is an exact theoretical prediction both within the 3d model of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) and the 1d model of eq .",
    "( [ eq16 ] ) ; see eqs .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) and ( [ eq25 ] ) .",
    "our numerical calculation also sheds light on the structure of the magnetic excitation spectrum in the intermediate phase @xmath11 where analytical results are practically absent .",
    "as is evident in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , a tail of line g with strong intensity survives in the intermediate region even at low temperature where line g itself looses its intensity for @xmath9 .",
    "such a tail should thus be attributed to a high - frequency collective excitation that appears in the intermediate phase as a shadow of the single - ion two - magnon bound state , an issue that deserves further theoretical attention .",
    "finally , the current calculation does not support the occurrence of a low - frequency y structure suggested by cox et al.@xcite , even though they also employ the 1d model of eq .",
    "( [ eq16 ] ) to calculate the susceptibility @xmath102 .",
    "in fact , we find a v structure with rapidly decreasing intensity near the center of the intermediate phase .",
    "as such the v structure is expected to be especially vulnerable to small perturbations that are ever present in effective heisenberg models .",
    "this may explain the deformation of the v into a u shape in the presence of a small dzyaloshinskii - moriya anisotropy @xcite .",
