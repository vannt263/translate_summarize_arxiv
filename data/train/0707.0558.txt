    "a series of space very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) experiments in which an orbiting radio telescope satellite was used for vlbi observations has provided successful development of very high spatial resolution in astronomy . in particular , the first dedicated space vlbi project , vsop , with the halca satellite achieved remarkable scientific results based on spatial resolution up to 1.2 and 0.4  mas at 1.6 and 5  ghz , respectively , with an apogee altitude of 21375  km @xcite . to come after the successful vsop , the next space vlbi mission , vsop-2 ,",
    "is being planned by institute of space and astronautical science ( isas ) @xcite .",
    "this project will launch a satellite radio telescope ( srt ) , which will be equipped with a 9.1-m off - axis paraboloid antenna and dual - polarization receivers to observe at 8.4 , 22 , and 43  ghz , together with terrestrial radio telescopes ( trts ) with the sensitivity being a factor - of - ten higher than vsop .",
    "launch is planned for 2012 . with two intermediate frequency ( if ) bands , each with a two - bit sampled 128-mhz a total 256-mhz bandwidth will be available .",
    "the achievable maximum baselines will exceed 37800  km with the planned apogee altitude of 25000  km , and the highest spatial resolution will be 38  @xmath1as at 43  ghz .",
    "millimeter - wave observations in space vlbi will be a frontier in astrophysics because there are various compact objects for which very high spatial resolution is essential @xcite",
    ". there is , however , a difficulty in millimeter - wave vlbi in terms of the fringe phase stability .",
    "data - averaging of the fringe is usually performed within a certain time scale , the so - called coherence time , for which a root - mean - square ( rms ) of the fringe phase is less than one radian . in the conventional calibration scheme in vlbi with a fringe - fitting technique @xcite ,",
    "it is necessary that the fringe be detected in less than the coherence time .",
    "the coherence time in vlbi at 43  ghz is limited to a few minutes by stochastic variations in the fringe phase , mainly due to the turbulent media of the earth s atmosphere ; it is thus difficult to conduct a long - time averaging in vlbi in order to improve the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) .",
    "although celestial radio waves received on a satellite are not affected by the atmosphere , the fringe of a space baseline ( a combination of orbiting and terrestrial telescopes ) also suffers from the atmospheric phase fluctuations because one of the elements is inevitably a terrestrial radio telescope .",
    "phase referencing is a successful phase - calibration scheme for vlbi . here",
    "a scientifically interesting target source is observed with an adjacent reference calibrator with fast antenna pointing changes ( antenna switching ) in order to compensate for any rapid phase fluctuations due to the atmosphere ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "phase referencing can also remove long - term phase drifts due to geometrical errors and smoothly variable atmospheric delay errors , as well as any instability of the independent frequency standards .",
    "the phase referencing technique has been proved for imaging faint radio sources that can not be detected with the conventional vlbi data reduction ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "various astrometric observations in the vlbi field have also been made with the phase referencing technique to obtain the relative positions with the accuracies on the order of 10  @xmath1as ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; reid et al . 1999 ; @xcite ) .",
    "phase referencing will be useful for vsop-2 .",
    "to investigate which component of errors has a more significant influence than others on the quality of the synthesized images obtained with vsop-2 phase referencing , and to give feedback for designing the satellite system , a software simulation tool for space vlbi has been developed .",
    "here we report on the effectiveness of vsop-2 phase referencing by simulation .",
    "the basic ideas of phase compensation with phase referencing are described in section  2 .",
    "the residual phase errors after phase compensation are discussed in section  3 based on quantitative estimations . in section  4 , the newly developed space vlbi simulator for this study is described .",
    "simulation work for vsop-2 phase referencing is presented to clarify the constraints on specific observing parameters : the separation angle between a target and a calibrator ; the time interval to switch a pair of sources ; the orbit determination accuracy of the satellite .",
    "further discussions are given in section  5 to describe the feasibility of phase referencing with vsop-2 .",
    "the conclusions are summarized in section  6 .",
    "in this section we describe basic ideas of phase referencing . in the following discussion a single on - source duration is referred to as a scan . in phase referencing ,",
    "alternate scans are made on the target and phase referencing calibrator .",
    "one observation period from the beginning of the calibrator scan , then the target scan and return to the beginning of the calibrator scan , is referred to as the switching cycle time , @xmath2 .",
    "figure  [ fig:02 - 01 ] shows a schematic drawing of vsop-2 phase referencing .",
    "the correlated vlbi data reveal a time series of a complex quantity , called a fringe , which is composed of amplitude and phase including information on the visibility of a celestial object as well as various errors from instruments and propagation media . let us assume that the difference in the arrival time of a celestial radio wave between telescopes and its derivative are largely removed by subtracting their a priori values , calculated in the correlator .",
    "phase referencing is used to observe the target and a closely located calibrator in the sky .",
    "we refer to the fringe phases of the target and phase referencing calibrator as @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively , expressed as follows : @xmath5 where    @xmath6 : the a priori phase calculated in the correlator ;    @xmath7 , @xmath8 : phase errors due to the dynamic components of the troposphere and ionosphere , respectively ;    @xmath9 , @xmath10 : long - term phase variations depending on the observing elevations of terrestrial telescopes due to the uncertainties of the tropospheric and ionospheric zenith excess path delays , respectively ;    @xmath11 : phase error due to the baseline vector error coming from uncertainties of the telescope positions and erroneous estimations of the earth orientation parameters ( eop ) ;    @xmath12 : the instrumental phase error due to the independent frequency standards , transmitting electric cables and so on ;    @xmath13 : phase error due to the uncertainty in the a priori source position in the sky ;    @xmath14 : visibility phase component representing the source structure ;    @xmath15 : a contribution of the thermal noise .    here",
    ", @xmath16 is the time that the target is observed , and @xmath17 , temporally @xmath18 apart from @xmath16 , is the time that the calibrator is observed .",
    "if the structure of the calibrator is well - known , three terms can be identified in equation  ( [ equ:02 - 02 ] ) , as follows : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is an error term consisting of @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "the calibration data , @xmath29 , for the target at time @xmath16 is obtained from @xmath20 of the temporally closest two calibrator scans , as follows : @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are interpolated calibrator phases at @xmath16 .",
    "the final step of the phase compensation is carried out by subtracting @xmath33 from equation ( [ equ:02 - 01 ] ) , as follows : @xmath34    \\nonumber \\\\                            & & +     \\phi_{\\mathrm{dtrp}}(t^{\\mathrm{t } } )   + \\phi_{\\mathrm{dion}}(t^{\\mathrm{t } } )   + \\phi_{\\mathrm{strp}}(t^{\\mathrm{t } } )   + \\phi_{\\mathrm{sion}}(t^{\\mathrm{t } } )    \\nonumber \\\\                            & & +     \\phi_{\\mathrm{bl}}(t^{\\mathrm{t } } )   + \\phi_{\\mathrm{inst}}(t^{\\mathrm{t } } )   + \\delta\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{therm}}(t^{\\mathrm{t}}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the phase difference between @xmath3 and @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is the phase difference between @xmath38 and @xmath32 .",
    "if @xmath2 is short enough ( typically , shorter than a few minutes at centimeter to millimeter waves ) and the calibrator is located closely enough ( typically , within a few degrees ) , the phase errors , except for the thermal noise , can almost be canceled .",
    "an uncanceled term , @xmath39 , gives the relative position of the target to the calibrator with a typical accuracy of much less than one mas .",
    "another aspect of the advantages of phase referencing is to eliminate the rapid time variation caused by the turbulent atmosphere .",
    "this means that the coherence time , which is limited by the atmosphere , becomes longer , so that faint radio sources can be detected by means of the long time averaging .",
    "although phase referencing is capable of removing a large amount of the fringe phase errors , residual phase errors remain after phase compensation because the target and calibrator are observed with a certain time separation , and not on the same line of sight .",
    "being different from a terrestrial baseline consisting of both terrestrial telescopes , a single space baseline includes a single line - of - sight atmospheric phase error for a terrestrial telescope , and uncertainty of a satellite trajectory in the orbit . in this section",
    "we analytically estimate the residual phase errors of the space baseline after phase compensation .",
    "we attempt to characterize the distribution of phase offsets from a very large number of samples obtained with given parameters , such as uncertainties in the a priori values , switching cycle time , separation angle , zenith angle , and so on .",
    "the earth s atmosphere causes an excess path of radio waves passing through it ( thompson et al .",
    "let us distinguish two types of excess path errors in the following discussions : one is a dynamic component ( fluctuation error ) , and the other one is a nearly static component ( systematic error ) . here , we first address the atmospheric phase fluctuations .",
    "phase differences due to a turbulent medium are often characterized by a spatial structure function ( ssf ) , which is defined as the mean - square difference in the phase fluctuations at two sites separated by a displacement vector , @xmath40 , @xcite as follows : @xmath41 ^ 2              \\right > , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the angle brackets mean an ensemble average , and @xmath42 is a position vector . according to @xcite",
    ", the ssf of the atmospheric phase shift with kolmogorov turbulence can be approximated by : @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are referred as inner and outer scales , respectively , and @xmath46 is a structure coefficient .    the spatial structure of the atmospheric phase fluctuations can also be modeled as a phase screen , assuming frozen flow @xcite , in which a laminar sheet with a fixed spatial pattern representing the distribution of the turbulent medium , flows at a constant speed .",
    "we use the phase screen model in the following discussions about the atmospheric phase fluctuations .",
    "the water vapor in the troposphere is neither well mixed nor regularly distributed in the lower troposphere , and therefore is not well correlated with the ground - based meteorological parameters .",
    "hence , the water vapor in the troposphere is highly unpredictable .",
    "@xcite observationally showed that the inner and outer scales of the ssf are 1.2 and 6  km , respectively , at their observing site at the very large array .",
    "the tropospheric phase fluctuations play a major role in restricting the coherence time to be quite short , especially at millimeter waves , because the refractive index is non - dispersive in centimeter - to - millimeter waves . at higher observing frequency bands ,",
    "vlbi synthesized images can be improved by removing telescope data whose weather is not good .",
    "thus , to use a large terrestrial telescope network in vlbi is important not only for ( @xmath47 ,  @xmath48 ) coverage , but also to have a number of telescopes where the tropospheric conditions are good .    to make a successful phase connection at 22 or 43  ghz by interpolating the calibrator fringe phases",
    ", the switching cycle time should be shorter than a few minutes , and the separation angle should be smaller than a few degrees .",
    "assuming such a fast antenna switching observations for such a pair of sources , a residual phase error , @xmath49 , due to the dynamic troposphere for a space baseline , is expressed as follows : @xmath50            & \\approx &                      \\frac{2\\pi\\nu c_{\\mathrm{n } }                      \\sqrt{1.4h_{\\mathrm{s } } }                      \\sqrt{\\sec{z_{\\mathrm{g}}}}}{c }            \\nonumber \\\\            & \\times &                    \\left(\\frac{v_{\\mathrm{w } } t_{\\mathrm{swt}}}{2 }                     + { h_{\\mathrm{w } } \\delta\\theta}\\sec{z_{\\mathrm{g } } }                    \\right)^\\frac{5}{6},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the separation angle between the target and the calibrator , @xmath52 is the observing frequency , @xmath53 is the speed of light , @xmath54 is the structure coefficient of the ssf of the troposphere to the zenith , defined by @xcite , @xmath55 is the scale height of the tropospheric water vapor , @xmath56 is the wind velocity aloft or flow speed of the phase screen , @xmath57 is the height of the phase screen , and @xmath58 is the zenith angle at the ground surface for a terrestrial telescope .",
    "the first @xmath59 in equation ( [ equ:03 - 05 ] ) comes from an indication based on numerical calculations for the tropospheric phase fluctuations made by @xcite , while the second comes from a factor to project the separation between a pair of sources onto the phase screen .",

    "note that the satellite does not need to observe multiple calibrators in a short period , because the systematic errors are related to the terrestrial telescopes .",
    "if the atmospheric systematic errors can be successfully removed , a few centimeter od accuracy will be targeted so that the performance of vsop-2 phase referencing will be greatly improved .    in this report",
    "we have demonstrated the usefulness of aris in investigating the effectiveness of vsop-2 phase referencing .",
    "aris will also be convenient to check vlbi observation plans from the viewpoint of image quality . in this report we considered some of the intended cases of vsop-2 phase referencing observations for point sources with the highest spatial resolution ;",
    "further investigation can be made for an individual source .",
    "this is important for the vsop-2 scientific goals , especially at 22 and 43  ghz , because the phase referencing technique can not always be used at those frequency bands in terms of finding calibrators .",
    "aris will give helpful suggestions to comprise the effective observation and operation plans for the best performance in vsop-2 .",
    "the authors made use of the gps tec data taken by gsi and provided by kyoto university .",
    "the authors made use of the vlba calibrator catalogue of nrao and 2005f_astro catalogue of nasa gfsc .",
