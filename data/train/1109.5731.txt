    "strong correlations in impurity problems have been of tremendous theoretical interest.@xcite this interest has been spurred by the ability to engineer semiconducting quantum dots which are highly tunable.@xcite in such realizations of quantum dots , both the gate voltages of the quantum dot as well as the tunneling amplitudes between the dots and the leads can be tuned .",
    "this gives one the ability to study these systems throughout their entire parameter space .",
    "while the first reported dot systems involved single dots,@xcite more complicated dot structures can now be fabricated.@xcite    with this ability to engineer multi - quantum dot systems comes the ability to realize more exotic forms of kondo physics . in double dot systems , for example , one can explore the competition between the kondo effect and the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) interaction.@xcite because of the non - perturbative nature of the kondo effect at low temperatures , one might expect this competition to be non - trivial .",
    "we argue that it is in fact so for double dots arranged in parallel .    the geometry that we wish to consider is sketched in fig . 1 . here",
    "two closely spaced , single level dots do not directly interact with one another , either via tunneling or via a capacitive coupling .",
    "they are however connected to one another via hopping processes involving the two leads .",
    "we will want to consider a situation where a total of two electrons sit on the two dots and where the leads are symmetrically coupled to the two dots . in such a scenario only one continuum channel of electrons ( the even combination of the two leads ) couples to the two dots .",
    "in such a system the kondo effect and the rkky interaction are antithetical to one another .",
    "the kondo effect will promote many - body singlet formation while the rkky interaction will tend to encourage direct triplet formation between the two electrons on the two dots .",
    "one can then imagine ( at least ) two possible scenarios for ground state formation as one lowers the temperature ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . in the first scenario the rkky interaction dominates and at some intermediate temperature binds the two electrons on the two dots into a triplet . as the temperature is furthered lowered the kondo effect then comes into play partially screening the effective spin-1 object on the dots down to an effective spin-1/2 ( i.e. an underscreened kondo effect ) . here",
    "the physics is non - fermi liquid with low temperature quantities such as conductance having a logarithmic dependence in temperature .",
    "this scenario has been argued to hold in a number of studies including those based on a numerical renormalization group ( nrg).@xcite the particular implementation of the nrg there , however , has been criticized.@xcite    a second scenario can be envisioned characterized by a lack of a clear separation of the rkky effect from kondo physics ( i.e. the persistence of higher temperature rkky - induced triplet formation down to temperatures below a putative kondo temperature ) . in this scenario",
    "the low temperature state is an overall many - body singlet . at low temperatures",
    "any effective binding by an rkky interaction into a triplet state comes undone .",
    "rather the two electrons on the two dots participate in the singlet by screening one another in conjunction with the lead electrons .",
    "the physics in this scenario is sharply differentiated from the first by being fermi liquid .",
    "in particular the deviations in the conductance with temperature go as @xmath1 .",
    "this scenario has been supported by both bethe ansatz computations@xcite as well as",
    "slave boson mean field theory treatments.@xcite    it is the purpose of this paper to provide supporting evidence for the second scenario . in it",
    "we present a @xmath2 , @xmath0 treatment of the problem .",
    "the method of @xmath0 expansion is well known@xcite and has been used in the context of quantum dots / impurities.@xcite this treatment is distinct from the use of slave boson mean field theory ( sbmft ) to argue the validity of the second scenario .",
    "while sbmft is itself a @xmath0 technique , it represents some ( uncontrolled ) summation of @xmath0 diagrams . here",
    "instead we consider a @xmath0 expansion in a systematic fashion .",
    "in particular we argue that this @xmath0 expansion is consistent with the friedel sum rule  a hallmark of fermi liquid physics and so indicative of the second scenario .",

    "we further consider this model in the limit that the strength of the coulomb repulsion on the two dots , @xmath10 , is taken to @xmath11 thus precluding any double occupancy .",
    "the constraint of no double - occupancy is fulfilled by first introducing the slave boson formalism , one slave boson for each dot : @xmath12 here @xmath13 is the pseudofermion ( denoted later in feynman diagrams by dashed lines ) which annihilates one `` occupied state '' on dot @xmath14 and @xmath15 is a bosonic operator ( denoted later by wavy lines ) which creates an empty state on dot @xmath14 .",
    "we subject these new degrees of freedom to the constraint , @xmath16 which we enforce by adding two lagrange multipliers @xmath17 and @xmath18 to the hamiltonian @xmath19 we thus understand the partition function of the system to be computed via @xmath20 in treating quantities in this model , we will perform a systematic diagrammatic expansion in @xmath0 where @xmath21 is the degeneracy of each dot .",
    "we suppose the dot - lead couplings , @xmath9 , satisfy the following ratio condition , @xmath22 this condition ensures that only one effective channel of lead electrons couples to the two dots . to see this we reexpress the hamiltonian in terms of even and odd channels , @xmath23 where @xmath24 . in terms of these new degrees of freedom ,",

    "we have argued that this ground state is fermi liquid using both the bethe ansatz@xcite and sbmft.@xcite this then provides a complementary piece of evidence for this fermi liquid nature .",
    "such evidence is needed because there exists in the literature an opposite set of results coming from numerical renormalization group analyses.@xcite in ref .",

    "we will end on a tangential note by stressing the remarkable similarity between results obtained for a double dot in a ( low order ) @xmath0 expansion and sbmft .",

    "we note though that while the @xmath0 expansion agrees quantitatively with sbmft and while both of these methods agree on a qualitative level with the bethe ansatz , these methods do not produce fine details of the conductance of the double dots brought out by the bethe ansatz ( see ref . ) , presumably the most trustworthy method of the three as it represents an exact solution of the problem .",
