    "the optical circuit is able to prevent false signals rising from two - pair emission .",
    "this is an important feature of the scheme@xcite since the creation probabilities for two pairs are much larger than for three pairs .",
    "furthermore , contributions from the higher order terms of spdc can be limited by controlling the corresponding creation probabilities@xcite .",
    "it is also worth noting that for a given three - pair photon state , the probability of creating a heralded entangled state , i.e. , @xmath89 , is controllable by changing the transmission coefficients of the bs , which can be up to @xmath90@xcite .",
    "* photon source . *",
    "the required photon pairs are generated by type - ii spdc from a pulsed laser in a @xmath91-barium - borate ( bbo ) crystal . here , we use a pulsed high - intensity ultraviolet ( uv ) laser with a central wavelength of @xmath92 nm , a pulse duration of @xmath93 fs and repetition rate of @xmath94 mhz . for an average power of @xmath95 mw uv light and after improvements in collection efficiency and stability of the photon sources , we observe @xmath96 photon pairs per second with a visibility of @xmath97 measured in the diagonal ( @xmath53 ) basis .",
    "( the visibility is defined by @xmath98 , were @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ) denotes the number of two - fold desired ( undesired ) coincidence counts .",
    "then there exists a direct connection between visibility and fidelity of a measured state @xmath55 : @xmath101 , where @xmath102 for @xmath103 denotes the visibility of photon pair in the diagonal , circular , and linear bases , respectively . here",
    "@xmath104 is the singlet bell state . )",
    "then the probability of creating three photon pairs is about @xmath105 per pulse , which is @xmath106 times larger than that of the next leading order term .",
    "the estimation of the three - pair creation probability per pulse is based on the experimental pair generation rate and the theoretical @xmath107-pair creation probability@xcite @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is a real - valued coupling coefficient . from the two - fold coincidence measurement result , the experimental pair generation rate is @xmath110 .",
    "we assume that @xmath111 , @xmath109 can directly be derived from @xmath112 .",
    "thus the estimated creation probability @xmath113 and @xmath114 are obtained .    * experimental imperfections . * with single photon resolving detectors and @xmath115 detection efficiency",
    ", one can see that the three - pair state can provide a maximally entangled photon pair in the output modes deterministically with a 100% probability , if and only if the remaining photons give rise to a fourfold coincidence among the four trigger modes . with the widely used standard spcm",
    ", one can not discriminate pure single photons from multi - photons which in reality leads to a significant problem of under counting photons .",
    "accordingly , the trigger detectors can herald a successful event even though more than two photons from either mode @xmath116 or @xmath117 or both have been transmitted to the trigger channels .",
    "furthermore , experimentally we were only able to obtain an average detection efficiency of about @xmath78 resulting from limited collection and detector efficiencies . here",
    "the mean detection efficiency is averaged over the coupling efficiency of eight fibre couplers and the quantum efficiency of the detectors .",
    "in addition to the imperfect detections , there are two other factors that affect the performance of our source : the non - ideal quality of the initially prepared pairs and the higher - order terms of down - converted photons .",
    "for perfectly created pairs , destructive two - photon interference effects@xcite will extinguish the contribution of two - pair emission to the trigger signal . with an experimental visibility of @xmath118",
    "imperfectly created states may still give rise to a contribution of two - pair events that leads to the detection of the auxiliary triggers .",
    "in addition , four - pair emission can again contribute to both the triggers and the output .",
    "although the experimentally estimated creation probability for a four - pair emission is only @xmath119 per pulse and is much smaller than the probability for a three - pair photon state @xmath120 per pulse , four - pair contribution can lead to an error of the theoretical estimation of the expected preparation efficiency of about @xmath121 .",
    "the four - pair contribution is evaluated in the same way as the three - pair state , where the limited detection efficiency of the trigger detectors is considered in the calculation ( see supplementary information ) . in fig .  3",
    ", the fluctuations of our experimental data mainly result from the intrinsic statistics of detector counts , and the stability of optical alignment .",
    "* experimental fidelity @xmath122 . * every expectation value for a correlation function is obtained by making a local measurement along a specific polarization basis and computing the probability over all the possible events .",
    "for instance , to get the expectation value of @xmath123 correlation @xmath124 , we perform measurements along the circular basis and then get the result by the number of coincidence counts of @xmath123 over the sum of all coincidence counts of @xmath123 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
