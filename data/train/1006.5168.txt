    "there are two main classes of luminous and weakly magnetized neutron stars ( nss ) in low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , i.e. , atoll and z sources , named after the patterns that they trace out in x - ray color - color diagrams ( cds ) or hardness - intensity diagrams ( hids ) @xcite .",
    "atoll sources have lower luminosities ( @xmath40.0010.5 @xmath5 ) than z sources and have two distinct x - ray states , i.e. , hard ( energy spectra are roughly flat with power - law photon index near 1.7 ) and soft states ( energy spectra follow exponential decrease above @xmath410 kev ) .",
    "there is also a `` transitional '' state between these two .",
    "the hard , transitional and soft states of atoll sources are also often referred to as the `` extreme island '' , `` island '' , and `` banana '' states / branches , respectively .",
    "z sources only have soft spectra , but there are three distinct branches with different spectral and timing behaviors .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite analyzed a transiently accreting ns , , which changed from z - source behavior to atoll - source characteristics as the outburst decayed from near / super eddington luminosity ( @xmath5 ) to almost quiescence .",
    "these results confirmed that the behavior that the differences in the properties of the two classes are due to their different mass accretion rates .",
    "the spectral modeling of ns lmxbs has been controversial for a long time ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "the continuum of soft - state spectra in both atoll and z sources are generally described by two - component models that include a soft / thermal and a hard / comptonized component ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and there have been two competing models , often referred to as the _ eastern _ model ( after * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the _ western _ model ( after * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with different choices of the thermal and comptonized components . in the _ eastern _ model ,",
    "the thermal and comptonized components are described by a multicolor disk blackbody ( mcd ) and a comptonized blackbody , respectively . in the _ western _ model , on the other hand",
    ", the thermal component is a single - temperature blackbody ( bb ) from the boundary layer , and there is comptonized emission from the disk . in the hard state ,",
    "the spectra are dominated by a hard / comptonized component , but a soft / thermal component is generally still required @xcite .",
    "@xcite implemented the commonly used two - component models for two classical transient atoll sources , i.e. , and , and outlined the problem of model degeneracy for accreting nss , not only from the choices of the thermal components , but also from the detailed description of comptonized components ( i.e. , the scattering corona geometry , the seed photon temperature , etc . ) .",
    "the physical interpretation of the spectral evolution of these atoll sources inferred from these different models also varies substantially .",
    "however , none of the tested models produced results similar to those of black - hole x - ray binaries , i.e. , @xmath6 tracks for the mcd component and weak comptonization for the soft - state spectra when the integrated rms variability in the power density spectrum ( 0.1 - 10 hz ) is only a few percent @xcite .",
    "@xcite devised a hybrid model for atoll sources , based on a detailed study two frequently recurring atoll - type transients .",
    "this model uses a bb to describe the boundary layer plus a broken power law for the hard state , and two strong thermal components ( mcd and bb ) plus a constrained broken power law ( when needed ) for the soft state .",
    "this choice for the soft state offers a weak - comptonization solution that differs from the strong comptonization solution of the two - component models that had previously dominated the literature .",
    "the results of the application of the hybrid model can be summarized as follows : both the mcd and bb evolve approximately as @xmath6 , the spectral / timing correlations of these nss are aligned with the properties of accreting black holes , and the visible bb emission area is very small but roughly constant over a wide range of @xmath7 that spans both the hard and soft states .",
    "@xcite applied this x - ray spectral model to , and similar results were obtained for the observations when the source displayed atoll - source behavior .",
    "deviations of the mcd from the @xmath8 track were observed when the source was bright and behaved as a z source , with the inner disk showing a luminosity - dependent radius increase .",
    "this was interpreted as an effect of maintaining the local eddington limit in the inner disk edge as the mass accretion rate varies .",
    "the hybrid spectral model is still empirical , especially the modeling of comptonization .",
    "moreover , this model has only been applied thus far to extensive data obtained with the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( ) . has two pointing instruments , which cover the energy range from @xmath42.5 to 250 kev . however , there is emission from x - ray binaries below this energy range , as the characteristic temperatures of the thermal components are normally below 3 kev .",
    "thus , it is important to test this model using broad - band spectra that extend to photon energies below the sensitivity range of .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the persistently bright atoll source , @xcite , which was observed seven times in 2006 - 2008 by _ suzaku _ @xcite .",
    "one of the important features of _ suzaku _ is its broad energy band ( 0.2600 kev ) .",
    "we also analyzed two observations of made with _",
    "( 0.1300 kev ) in 2000 . both _",
    "suzaku _ and _ bepposax _ additionally provide better energy resolutions than ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 at 6 kev ( fwhm ) respectively ) , and this capability can be used to better resolve the broad fe emission lines .",
    "broad fe lines are commonly seen in x - ray binaries and provide another tool for investigating the accretion flow around compact objects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "timing studies for , including the findings of kilohertz quasi - periodic oscillations ( khz qpos ) , have been carried out using observations with @xcite .",
    "spectral studies of this source have also been carried out , using different kinds of x - ray detectors and spectral models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "several of these authors also reported the detection of a broad relativistic fe line from this source . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on the spectral properties of this source .",
    "we describe our data analysis in  [ sec : reduction ] , where we also present the long - term light curves and color - color diagrams .",
    "we perform detailed spectral modeling in  [ sec : specmod ] , for which we provide our physical interpretations in  [ sec : interpretation ] .",
    "finally we give our summary and discussion .",
    "the long - term light curve of is shown in figure  [ fig : asmdata ] .",
    "the gray solid line is from the all - sky monitor ( asm ; * ? ? ?",

    "we then applied the publicly available tool ` aeattcor.sl ` by john e. davis to obtain a new attitude file for each observation .",
    "this tool corrects the effects of thermal flexing of the _ suzaku _ spacecraft and obtains more accurate estimate of the spacecraft attitude . for all our seven observations , the above attitude correction produced sharper psf images . with the new attitude file , we updated the xis event files using the ftools ` xiscoord ` program .    since 4u 1705 - 440 is a relatively bright source , window and burst options were adopted during each observation to limit the effects of event pile - up ( table  [ tbl-1 ] ) . despite this , pile - up was still present in the image center .",
    "we estimated the pile - up fractions at different positions of the ccd using the publicly available tool ` pileup_estimate.sl ` by michael a. nowak .",
    "the pile - up fraction refers to the ratio of events lost via grade or energy migration to the events expected in the absence of pile - up .",
    "the unfiltered pile - up fractions integrated over the whole ccds are about 1015@xmath23 for all observations except for the observation 401046010 ( @xmath43@xmath23 ) .",

    ", we find that the spectral fitting results using 10@xmath23 pile - up exclusion regions show systematic decrease in the soft - component ( mcd ) flux and increase in the hard - component ( bb ) flux , by about 3@xmath23 , compared with the results using 5@xmath23 pile - up exclusion regions .",

    "even though our source can be regarded as a point source , there is no region of the detector plane that is free from the source emission to estimate the pure background .",
    "this is because the psf of the xis is quite spread out and our source during these seven observations was bright enough to dominate over the background ( 110 kev ) throughout the @xmath24 window .",
    "we compared results using two methods of estimating the background . in the first method",

    "figure  [ fig : bpldisk_bbd ] shows that the boundary layer emission flux is comparable with that from the disk . because the boundary layer is hotter than the disk @xcite , the soft - state spectra tend to cover a broader energy band and extend to higher energies in atoll - type ns lmxbs than in the thermal state of accreting black holes ( compare our figure  [ fig : samplefit ] and figure  2 in @xcite ) .",

    "such deviations have been seen in several black - hole x - ray binaries , and it is normally believed to be due to a spectral hardening effect , instead of a real change in the inner disk radius @xcite .",

    "the local specific flux in the disk appears as a simple dilute blackbody with a color temperature higher than the effective temperature by a factor of @xmath287 @xcite .",

    "thus , @xmath304 is not around 1 in the soft state , as shown in figure  [ fig : bpldisk_bbd ] , but is about 2.6 . if @xmath305 , the latitude range of the boundary layer is about @xmath306 , corresponding to an emission area of @xmath307 of the ns surface . in this case",
    "@xmath308 should be @xmath309 larger than shown in ",
    "[ sec : specmod ] .",
    "@xmath310 should increase by @xmath311 ( i.e. , adjusting for @xmath305 ) so that @xmath304 would be around 0.7 in the soft state .    whether the above results imply that the real boundary layer area is small and nearly constant further depends on the radiative transfer process in the atmosphere above the boundary layer , i.e. , the hardening effect as discussed above for the disk spectra .",
    "the small bb emission area is reminiscent of the well known spectral modeling problem of the ns thermal emission in quiescence , i.e. , the bb fit of its thermal component produced inferred radii too small for theoretical ns size estimate , whereas models taking into account the radiative transfer in the hydrogen atmosphere give radius estimate much closer to theoretical expectation of the size of nss ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , all our observations are quite bright ( @xmath312 erg / s ) , and the emission should be due to active accretion . at such a high accretion rate , a pure hydrogen atmosphere is not expected @xcite , and the above problem might not apply to our case .",
    "our conclusion of the small size of the boundary layer is based on the assumption that the modification of the bursting atmosphere on burst emergent spectra is similar to that of the boundary layer emission .",
    "this assumption might be valid if most of the heat in the boundary layer is generated in a layer as deep as that for burst nuclear burning .",
    "we note that the small inferred size of the boundary layer agrees with the theoretical expectation of most of the boundary layer models at sub - eddington accretion rates @xcite .",
    "thus it is quite possible that the boundary layer emission area is indeed small for our observations .",
    "if the behavior of the hardening factor for the boundary layer is similar to that for the burst emission , then one might conclude that the boundary layer emission area is constant if @xmath313 is measured , as the hardening factor is quite independent of the temperature for burst emission in sub - eddington limit @xcite .",
    "for example , for a ns with mass 1.4 and radius 10 km , table 2 from @xcite suggests an approximate relation of @xmath314 for @xmath315 within 1.12.5 kev ( most of our observations fall into this range ) .",
    "thus , our results of roughly following @xmath313 from the hard to soft states might imply little change of the real boundary layer emission area for our observations .",
    "we note that there is scatter in the inferred apparent emission area of the boundary layer .",
    "the fractional variation is about @xmath316 , larger than the typical error bars ( 10@xmath23 ) .",
    "there are also systematic differences in the inferred boundary layer emission area between _ bepposax _ and _ suzaku _ , both in the hard and soft states ( see tables  [ tbl-3][tbl-5 ] ) .",
    "whether all this is real or affected by systematic problems related to spectral models and/or instrumentation is unclear .",
    "if we do a simple power - law fit as we did for the mcd component , the bb component seems to follow @xmath317 from fit to all data combined and @xmath318 from fit to _ suzaku _ data only .",
    "because of the above uncertainties , we did not treat these deviations from @xmath301 as significant .",
    "a better understanding of our luminosity vs. temperature results for the disk and boundary layer of an accreting ns may be gained from further theoretical work on each component , and from additional observations , e.g. , with improved statistics and dynamic range for samples of the hard state .",
    "the broad - band x - ray spectra of obtained with _ suzaku _ and _ bepposax _ show two distinct hard and soft spectral states .",
    "these spectra have significantly better coverage in the soft x - ray energy band compared with those from .",
    "we have successfully fit these spectra using the model similar to @xcite .",
    "the accretion disk in the soft state seems to approximately follow a @xmath1 track .",
    "one cause of the deviation from @xmath319 maybe a luminosity - dependent spectral hardening factor .",
    "however , it is still possible that the inner disk radius is really changing in some part of the soft state .",
    "we found no significant contribution of the thermal disk in our hard - state spectra above 1 kev , and the disk might be truncated at a large radius and/or has a low temperature ( @xmath320 kev ) , or is buried under high comptonization .",
    "the boundary layer is roughly constant from the hard to soft states , with apparent emission size about 1/11 of the whole surface of the neutron star . assuming that the disk is truncated by the isco in the soft state or the ns surface , we estimated the magnetic field of in to be less than about @xmath3 g.    broad relativistic fe lines are also detected in most of the spectra , especially in the soft state .",
    "we modeled them with the diskline model and found that the strength of the fe line correlates well with the boundary layer emission in the soft state , with the fe line flux about 4% of the flux from the boundary layer ( @xmath321 kev ) . in the hard state",
    ", our results suggest that the fe lines are due to the strong comptonization emission",
    ". however , the comptonization emission in the hard state seems to illuminate the accretion disk and produce the fe line not as efficiently as the boundary layer emission in the soft state , probably because the boundary layer is closer to the inner accretion disk .",
    "the authors would like to express their thanks to all members of the suzaku team members , especially koji mukai , for their support in the schedule of observations and preparation of this paper .",
    "support for this research was provided by the nasa grant nnx08ac02 g under the suzaku guest observer program and the nasa contract to mit for rxte instruments ."
