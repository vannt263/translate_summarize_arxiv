    "the large @xmath37 limit is corresponding to the large scaling dimension limit .",
    "there are several cases of interest , especially the cases @xmath57 and @xmath61 for the application of the fermi surface and novel phases as we see in  [ sec : entanglemententropyadslc ] . for the analysis of the correlation functions for alcf , these cases are no different from other values of @xmath0 .    the conformal dimension of the scalar operator is @xmath574 .",
    "the solution that satisfies the proper boundary condition at @xmath285 is @xmath575 note that we have normalized the solution at the boundary according to , and thus we find the momentum space correlation function as @xmath576 , by expanding the modified bessel function .",
    "fourier transforming back to position space , we find the two - point function to be @xmath577 where @xmath264 is an operator dual to the massive @xmath15 in the bulk .",

    "_ for @xmath316 case _    the equation of motion in momentum space is @xmath578 this is the case we can see the effect of the hyperscaling violation clearly .",
    "the scaling dimension @xmath323 of the scalar operator is shifted to @xmath324 due to the hyperscaling violation exponent @xmath1 .",
    "the solution is given by bessel function with explicit dependence of @xmath1 .",
    "following the prescription described above , we get an exact result @xmath579 upto some numerical factor independent of momentum .",
    "this function can be exactly evaluated to give the position space correlation function as @xmath580 thus we observe the effect of the hyperscaling violation exponent @xmath1 .",

    "the two point function is dominated by the large @xmath311 behavior as @xmath348 , whose inverse fourier transform gives @xmath349 for @xmath350 , we can use the saddle point approximation to get @xmath588 this case reduces to ( [ spacelikepropagatorgeneraladslc ] ) for @xmath114 .",

    "we can re - express the same condition as @xmath591 .",

    "to progress further , we need to specify the parameters .    _ for @xmath593 case _",

    ", we can check that the equation reduces to ( [ scalarfieldeqmomadslc ] ) .",
    "the reason behind is that the equation ( [ scalarfieldeqmomadslc ] ) we start with does not depend on @xmath0 and thus the condition @xmath593 does not put any constraint on it .",

    "the cases with @xmath599 would be interesting to further investigate .    for @xmath600 ,",
    "the mass term is not important at the boundary @xmath83 and thus we can use the prescription ( [ correlationexpansion ] ) . then the naive scaling dimension is shifted to @xmath407 .",
    "the equation ( [ scalarfieldeqmomadslc ] ) is invariant under the galilean boost , and the unique combination for energy and momenta @xmath408 should be maintained .",
    "moreover , there is a scaling symmetry in the equation @xmath601 under which the coefficient function @xmath410 should transform as @xmath602 .",
    "then , the momentum space correlation function has the general form @xmath603 when @xmath604 , @xmath414 is independent of @xmath311 , and thus we can fourier transform back to the position space to find @xmath605 which is the general result with the effect of @xmath1 .      from the discussion of  [ sec : entanglemententropy ] , it becomes clear that there is unique prescription for the minimal surface , and static and stationary cases end up to have the same result .",
    "once we have this picture in mind , it is not difficult to guess that the result would be the same for alcf .",
    "the form of the metric ( [ zerotadsinlcmetric2 ] ) is uniquely fixed if we use the power of @xmath48 to make up the dimension of @xmath39 to physical length .    using the prescription developed in ",
    "[ sec : entanglemententropy ] , we would like to compute the entanglement entropy for a strip with ( non-)compact @xmath39 direction @xmath606 in the limit @xmath432 . the strip is located at @xmath49 , and the profile of the surface in the bulk is given by @xmath433 .",

    "first , it will be interesting to generalize our discussions to the finite temperature black hole solutions . for lifshitz theories , the black hole solutions with hyperscaling violation is already proposed and analyzed in @xcite .",
    "constructing black hole solutions with hyperscaling violation is not simple for the schrdinger type theories , at least for @xmath70 . for @xmath613 and @xmath70 ,",
    "the solution is constructed and analyzed in @xcite @xcite , using a very nice solution generating technique called null melvin twist @xcite .",
    "the resulting black hole solutions are complicated and computations of physical properties are difficult .",
    "as we mentioned already , there is simpler and viable construction for the schdinger holography , ads in light - cone ( alcf ) with @xmath69 .",
    "the corresponding black hole solution is also constructed and analyzed in @xcite@xcite .",
    "it turns out that , at least for @xmath53 , the thermodynamic properties of these two black hole solutions are identical @xcite@xcite and some transport properties are also identical if comparison is reliable @xcite .",
    "thus we naively expect that the black hole constructions for @xmath70 and @xmath614 with non - zero @xmath1 would give the same thermodynamic properties",
    ". it will be interesting to check this explicitly @xcite .    from the discussion in ",
    "[ sec : stringconst ] , it is clear that there are several interesting cases with @xmath599 . for those cases , we are not able to evaluate correlation functions due to technical difficulties .",
    "the situation is similar to lifshitz type theories @xcite , there dimensional reduction of d2 brane solution @xcite provides an example with @xmath615 , which corresponds an important example of the holographic application to condensed matter",
