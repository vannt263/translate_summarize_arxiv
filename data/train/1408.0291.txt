    "one of the most important issues for many applications of type - ii superconductors is understanding how to optimize the pinning of magnetic flux vortices , since the system becomes dissipative when vortices are in motion @xcite .",
    "the applied current at which vortices depin is called the critical current @xmath0 , and there has been intense research in tailoring the pinning in a superconductor so as to maximize @xmath0 for either specific applied fields or for a broad range of fields . beyond the direct application to superconductivity , vortex pinning and dynamics provide a very rich system for exploring collective ordering of particles on random or periodic substrates , as well as for studying nonequilibrium phenomena at depinning which arise in a variety of condensed matter systems , such as driven charge density waves @xcite , sliding wigner crystals @xcite , atomic friction @xcite , adhesion @xcite , magnetic domain wall motion @xcite , and driven colloidal systems @xcite .",
    "a widely used method for enhancing the pinning and critical current in superconductors is the creation of nanostructured artificial arrays of pinning sites @xcite , featuring a well - defined number of sites arranged in a desired configuration .",
    "these sites pin vortices effectively , but only a limited number of sites can be added to a sample since their creation causes local damage to the superconductor that decreases the material s current - carrying capacity .",
    "therefore , it is of great importance to determine the optimal geometrical arrangement of a _ fixed _ number of pinning sites that generates the strongest pinning over the widest range of fields .",
    "in random site arrangements , where there is a distribution of interpin spacings , the closely - spaced pins are inefficiently used due to strong short - range intervortex repulsion , while widely - spaced pins permit easy flow of vortices between them @xcite .",
    "periodic pinning arrays such as triangular or square arrays , which avoid both these shortcomings , have been studied in detail ; the pinning is enhanced compared to random arrays , but only near certain commensurate field values , where the number of vortices is an integer @xcite or fractional @xcite multiple of the number of pinning sites . at commensurability , ordered or partially ordered vortex arrangements form which can have various types of symmetries @xcite ; however , away from commensurability , the vortex structures are partially or totally disordered , allowing for the formation of weak spots and easy vortex flow channels which reduce the depinning threshold @xcite .",
    "rectangular pinning arrays that are periodic with two different length scales have been shown to produce anisotropic vortex structures and transport @xcite .",
    "there have been a number of efforts to enhance the pinning in periodic arrays under noncommensurate conditions . systematically diluting a triangular pinning array",
    "gives enhanced pinning not only at matching fields , but also at non - integer matching fields corresponding to what the integer matching fields for the non - diluted array would have been @xcite .",
    "other studies showed that the addition of some disorder to a triangular pinning lattice enhances the pinning at incommensurate fillings , but at the cost of reducing the maximum pinning at the integer matching fields @xcite .",
    "asymmetric system geometries , such as funnel geometries @xcite or periodic constriction geometries @xcite which utilize vortex jamming , produce new types of commensurability effects .",
    "vortex artificial ice states can be created using superlattices of square pinning arrangements @xcite , and exhibit strong matching at certain non - integer fields .",
    "composite pinning lattices based on intermeshed periodic arrays have also been created @xcite .",
    "another approach to pinning enhancement is the use of pinning structures that combine aspects of periodicity and disorder .",
    "studies of quasiperiodic arrays where pinning sites were placed at the vertices of a penrose tiling @xcite revealed novel non - integer matching conditions , and showed that the overall pinning can be enhanced over periodic triangular pinning arrays below the first matching field @xcite .    despite these efforts , pinning arrays",
    "which rely on commensuration effects have continued to possess the fundamental drawback of only providing enhanced pinning near certain field values , rather than over a broad range of field . in an effort to overcome this shortcoming ,",
    "a new type of pinning geometry , known as a conformal crystal pinning array , was recently proposed@xcite ; an example of such an array is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : transf](b ) .",
    "a conformal crystal is constructed by performing a conformal , or angle - preserving , transformation upon a uniform lattice structure such as a hexagonal array , producing a new structure which preserves the _",
    "local _ ordering of the original array but now exhibits a density gradient in one direction @xcite .",
    "conformal crystals were first observed as the approximate ground state structure of a set of repulsively interacting magnetic spheres restricted to move in two dimensions and subjected to a gravitational potential ; the distinctive arching appearance of the resulting structure inspired the whimsical nickname of `` gravity s rainbow '' @xcite . in vortex simulations ,",
    "conformal pinning arrays produced enhanced pinning compared to an equivalent number of pinning sites arranged randomly with uniform density over a wide range of applied fields , with the enhancement persisting until the applied field was increased beyond the maximum local pinning density present in the array @xcite .",
    "the conformal array also outperformed uniform periodic arrays except in the immediate vicinity of the matching field . a random array with a density gradient produced pinning only marginally better than a non - gradient random array and substantially worse than the conformal array , indicating that the preservation of local order was as vital to the conformal array s performance as was the introduction of a gradient .",
    "the enhancement was observed both in flux gradient - driven simulations @xcite , where the vortices enter or exit the system from the edges , and in current - driven simulations @xcite , where the vortex density is fixed and the vortices are driven across the sample with a uniform lorentz force .",
    "two subsequent experiments confirmed the enhanced pinning in conformal arrays . in the first@xcite ,",
    "conformal pinning arrays displayed enhanced critical currents over uniform periodic pinning arrays except in the vicinity of certain matching fields . in the second@xcite , conformal pinning arrays showed decreased magnetoresistance in transport experiments compared to periodic or diluted periodic structures with the same number of pinning sites .    pinning arrays with a density gradient not produced by a conformal transformation have also been investigated .",
    "a pinning array consisting of concentric rectangular `` rings '' of pinning sites with a gradually increasing separation between the rings was fabricated and shown to exhibit enhanced pinning compared to a periodic pinning array @xcite .",
    "additionally , there have been numerical studies of pinning arrays arranged in circular hyperbolic tessellation structures so that the pinning sites have a gradient @xcite ; however , these studies did not include comparisons with periodic or random pinning arrays to check whether the hyperbolic array produces enhanced pinning over the other geometries .",
    "in this work , we use molecular dynamics simulations to study magnetization , depinning , ordering and dynamics of vortices in systems with various types of pinning arrays featuring a density gradient .",
    "we investigate the effect of different local orderings in conformal crystal arrays by considering transformed versions of hexagonal , square , quasiperiodic , and archimedean @xcite lattices .",
    "we also consider two non - conformal systems , a rectangular pinning array with a one - dimensional ( 1d ) gradient , and a random pinning arrangement with a density gradient .",
    "this manuscript is organized as follows : in section ii , we describe how conformal arrays are created and enumerate the various pinning arrays which will be analyzed . in section iii , we explain our physics model and the types of simulations we perform . in section iv , we show the results of magnetization simulations , demonstrating that conformal pinning arrays produce enhanced pinning over non - conformal gradient arrays over a wide range of applied fields , as well as over arrays of uniform density such as the quasiperiodic penrose array or periodic arrays ( aside from a narrow range around matching fields ) . in section",
    "v , by examining the pattern of occupied pinning sites as the field is increased , we show that conformal arrays are effective due to a _ local _",
    "commensuration effect which is an extension of the global matching exhibited by uniform pinning arrays : because the conformal transformation introduces a continuously changing lattice constant into the array , the vortex lattice can progressively match with different slices of the array as the number of vortices is increased .",
    "consequently , we find that the particular type of local order present is relatively unimportant in determining the effectiveness of conformal pinning arrays , as long as some type of ordering is present that would give a matching effect in a uniform array .",
    "we also use local commensuration to explain the maximum effective field value for conformal arrays . at higher fields well above this value ,",
    "we show in section vi that a rectangular gradient pinning array gives enhanced pinning over the conformal arrays due to a novel commensuration effect which gives rise to ordered vortex chain structures . in section vii , we examine current - driven vortex dynamics for vortices driven along the gradient direction as well as at varied angles with respect to the gradient .",
    "we find that in general , conformal pinning arrays reduce vortex motion compared to the other arrays , over the full range of drive angles .",
    "compared to the random and rectangular gradient arrays which exhibit channels of easy vortex flow , the arching structure of the conformal arrays prevents the formation of such channels for any choice of drive angle .",
    "additionally we find that many gradient arrays have a pronounced vortex guidance effect , where vortices move much more easily perpendicular to the gradient than along the gradient",
    ". finally , in section viii , we present our conclusions .",
    "conformal transformations are a well - studied topic from complex analysis @xcite .",
    "an analytic function @xmath1 maps two infinitesimal vectors originating from the same point in the @xmath2 plane with angle @xmath3 between them to two new vectors in the @xmath4 plane separated by the same angle .",
    "we use this property to transform an ordered structure into one which remains locally ordered but which is distorted on a global scale .        in this work",
    ", we allow the transformation @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 is a constant which we set to @xmath7 ) to act on a semiannular section of the @xmath2-plane specified by @xmath8 and @xmath9 for some choice of @xmath10 and @xmath11",
    ". this transformation maps radial lines in the @xmath2 plane to vertical lines in the @xmath4 plane , and circular arcs centered at the origin to horizontal lines .",
    "consequently , the semiannular region * abcdef * is mapped to the rectangle * abcdef * , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : transf ] . the circular arcs in the @xmath2 plane",
    "are increasingly stretched by the transformation as their radial coordinate decreases : fixing @xmath12 , arc * abc * has the same length as line * abc * , while arc * def * is stretched to the same length as lines * def * and * abc*. this increasing stretch causes an ordered structure with uniform density , such as the hexagonal lattice shown in fig .

    "[ fig : transf](b ) .",
    "the local ordering of the original structure is preserved due to the conformal nature of the mapping : each site in the transformed lattice retains its six nearest neighbors .",
    "the conformally transformed hexagonal structure was studied in previous work @xcite , where it was termed a `` conformal pinning array '' or `` cpa . '' since in the present work we also consider other types of local order , we here refer to this array as a `` conformal hex '' array , or `` chex '' for short . figure [ fig : carray ] illustrates conformal arrays with other types of local order . in fig .",

    "[ fig : carray](b ) shows the transformed version of a so - called `` archimedean 33434 '' array .",
    "archimedean tilings of the plane are periodic tilings created using two or more types of regular polygon .",
    "several such tilings exist @xcite ; here we consider a particular type , 33434 , composed of squares and triangles .",
    "a uniform pinning array based on such a tiling has been studied extensively @xcite .",

''",
    "all pinning arrays fit into a rectangular region of dimension @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the london penetration depth , and have a nominal average density of pinning sites equal to @xmath15 ( i.e. each array contains approximately 432 pins , with small deviations on the order of 1% due to boundary effects . )",
    "this density can be obtained through appropriate choices of the parameter @xmath10 and the lattice constant of the original uniform lattice .",
    "the local pinning density varies from a maximum of @xmath16 to a minimum of @xmath17 .",
    "the conformal arrays described above all have the common features of local ordering and a density gradient . the local pinning density ( or equivalently",
    ", the local lattice constant ) varies fairly smoothly through the array due to the continuous nature of the conformal transformation . in order to determine the relative importance of each of these two features in maximizing the effectiveness of the pinning , we consider two other array types .    the first alternative array is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : garray](a ) and consists of a rectangular pinning array with a lattice constant that varies in the gradient direction so as to approximate the density profile of the conformal arrays as closely as possible .",
    "we call this array `` rectangular with gradient , '' or `` grect . ''",
    "the grect array differs from the conformal arrays in two respects : ( @xmath18 ) the lattice constant does not vary smoothly through the array , and ( @xmath19 ) the original uniform rectangular array from which the gradient array was constructed does not exhibit a commensuration peak . the importance of this second property will be explained in section [ sec : localcomm ] .    the second alternative array , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : garray](b ) , has a density gradient matching that of the conformal arrays , but the pinning sites are arranged randomly subject only to this constraint , so that all local ordering is eliminated .",
    "this array , called `` random with gradient '' or `` grandom , '' was studied in earlier work @xcite and found to be only minimally more effective than uniform random pinning .",
    "thus , we use the grandom array to establish a baseline of minimum effectiveness for pinning arrays with a density gradient .",
    "notice that this array type can be generated either by using the desired density profile as a bias when generating pinning locations , or by conformally transforming a uniform random array ; the transformation does not add order where none was originally present .",
    "we employ two types of simulation geometries in this work .",
    "the first is a flux gradient - driven geometry @xcite where we apply a slowly varying magnetic field to a superconductor with pinning sites and calculate the resulting magnetization loops .",

    "we treat the resulting vortices in the material as perfectly stiff and use the london limit in which the vortices are assumed to be pointlike in the @xmath20 plane .",

    "the geometry and system size described here were previously shown to be sufficiently large to accurately model both magnetization curves and vortex ordering for conformal crystal pinning arrays @xcite , periodic pinning arrays @xcite , and random pinning @xcite .        at a given time during the simulation , the system contains a total of @xmath27 vortices and antivortices . as the external field is changed over the course of the simulation , @xmath27 varies .",

    "we next turn to penrose pinning arrays , since these have been claimed @xcite to also provide broadly effective pinning .",
    "the previous studies suffered from several drawbacks , such as a small sample and array size which diminishes any actual effect of the array s structure upon pinning effectiveness , the use of fractional pin occupancy as a proxy for critical current , and most importantly a lack of comparisons to other pinning structures besides triangular . here",

    "second , we find from fig .",
    "[ fig : pen55](b ) that even though vortices naturally arrange themselves in a hexagonal lattice in the absence of pinning , local hexagonal ordering is _ not _ necessary to obtain an effective conformal array : the c33434 array works as well , and the cpenrose array almost as well , as the chex array at enhancing pinning .    to verify that these results are robust",
    ", we repeat our measurements in samples with an increased pinning strength of @xmath90 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pen90 ] , the magnetization curves retain all of the behaviors described above . in particular , we confirm that conformal arrays work better than uniform arrays in each case , and that their performance does not depend sensitively on the type of local order present in the original untransformed array .",
    "to further test this , a future study could compare chex and csquare arrays in magnetization loops which extend up to the third matching field , since a uniform square array has a commensuration peak at the second matching field but not the third , while the uniform triangular array has the opposite response .",

    "as @xmath80 increases , the matching regions move toward the sample edges where the pinning density is greater . at the extreme edges of the sample the maximum local pinning density is @xmath16 . ]    in order to better understand how the structure of conformal arrays contributes to their enhanced pinning effectiveness over a broad range of field , and also what determines the limits of this range , we image the distribution of occupied pins as the field is increased .",
    "we take as our model system the chex array with @xmath91 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pinoccpix ] we show three snapshots of the occupied pinning sites at different field values , where we find vertical bands in which all the pinning sites are filled .",

    "[ fig:9](b ) , we highlight two occupancy peaks in @xmath95 near @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "these peaks correspond to the bands mentioned above , and signify areas where the vortex lattice _ locally _ matches with the pinning .",
    "this matching is distinct from the usual matching effect in a uniform pinning array which is global and occurs throughout the entire array . as @xmath80 increases , figs .",
    "[ fig:9](c - g ) show that the occupancy peaks move toward the sample edges .",
    "this occurs because at matching , the vortex density must match the pinning density ; thus , as the vortex density increases , the matching region must shift to the denser pinning regions that are closer to the edges of the sample .",
    "we also observe dips in @xmath95 adjacent to the peaks , on the sides closer to the center of the sample .",
    "the dips arise due to the mismatch between vortices and pins once the commensuration peak has passed , with interstitial vortices forcing vortices out of the pinning sites .",
    "the migration of the local matching peaks continues as the field increases until the peaks reach the maximally dense pinning regions at the sample edges . for the conformal arrays we use in this work ,",

    "<S> the effectiveness of conformal arrays arises from the continuum of length scales introduced into the arrays by the conformal transformation , allowing for a broad range of local commensuration effects . at higher vortex fillings above the range of conformal effectiveness , </S>",
    "<S> we show that a non - conformal rectangular gradient array exhibits strong pinning due to a novel commensuration effect and vortex ordering . using transport simulations where vortices are driven along the gradient and at an angle to the gradient </S>",

    "<S> for a rotated drive , the gradient arrays produce a strong vortex guidance effect in the direction perpendicular to the gradient . </S>"
