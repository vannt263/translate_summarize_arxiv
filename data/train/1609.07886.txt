    "the distance from earth to this snr is estimated to be about 1 kpc from the association with molecular clouds traced by co lines @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed that  is a remnant of the chinese  guest \" star in 393 ad ( hereafter sn393 ) that appeared within the curled tail of scorpius according to the historical descriptions .",
    "however , @xcite argued that sn393 should have been very bright with the peak apparent visual brightness of @xmath6 to @xmath7 and visible for over a year , which would be incompatible with the the chinese literature who did not mention the apparent brightness and stated that the guest star disappeared after eight months .",
    "putting aside the possible association with sn393 ,  is widely regarded as a relatively young supernova remnant due to its strong nonthermal x - ray emission . the nonthermal x - ray emission from",
    "is thought to be synchrotron radiation produced by high energy electrons ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) that are accelerated presumably via diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa : @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "snr  is one of the most important objects for the study of the shock acceleration machanism thanks not only to its strong nonthermal x - ray emission but also to the detection of high energy and very - high energy gamma rays ( @xcite ; @xcite , 2006 , 2007 ) .",
    "the image of the tev gamma - ray emission is broadly similar to the synchrotron x - ray image .",
    "the main radiation process responsible for the observed gamma - ray emission has been matter of active debate ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ) ; the gamma rays can be produced by inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of high energy electrons (  leptonic model \" ) or by neutral pion decay resulting from the collisions of high energy protons and ambient protons (  hadronic model \" ) .    in the framework of simple one - zone modeling where high - energy electrons and protons occupy the same volume with constant",
    "density and magnetic field strength , the hard spectrum in the gev gamma - ray band measured with the _ fermi _ large area telescope ( lat ) would be better described by the leptonic model @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field strength is estimated to be @xmath8 from the flux ratio between synchrotron x - ray and gamma - ray radiation within this framework . the magnetic field , however ,",
    "is probably enhanced ( amplified ) up to @xmath9 at some local scales , as manifested by the filamentary structures of synchrotron x - ray emission as well as the year - scale x - ray variability @xcite .",
    "the strong local magnetic field would be related to the interaction with molecular clouds @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if we introduce highly inhomogeneous medium such as the presence of dense clumps in a low density cavity @xcite , the gamma - ray emission would also be explained by the hadronic model @xcite .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the hard gev spectrum can be fit by @xmath10-decay gamma rays that takes account of energy - dependent penetration of high - energy protons into dense clumps .",
    "the measurements of synchrotron radiation and gamma - ray radiation do not provide sufficient information of the hydrodynamical properties of the remnant .",
    "instead , one needs to measure thermal radiation in order to constrain the physical parameters .",
    "after the long term to struggle with finding thermal components from , @xcite has recently discovered thermal x - ray emission around the central region of .",
    "based on the much higher abundance ratio of measured ne , mg and si to fe than the solar value , the progenitor mass is inferred to be less than @xmath11 .",

    "particularly it is quite meaningful to measure the age of snr  and to clarify which phase it is in , i.e. ejecta - dominated ( ed ) stage ( free expansion stage ) or sedov - taylor stage ( st stage ) .",
    "for example , the maximum energy of the accelerated protons at snr shock waves , @xmath12 , is expected to reach its maximum around the transition time from the ed stage to the st stage because dsa theory generally predicts @xmath12 decreases with time during the st stage : e.g. , @xmath13 for @xmath14 @xcite .    in this paper , we investigate the hydrodynamical properties based on the x - ray expansion measurement of . in  [ sec : observation ] , we present the observation data sets .",

    "[ fig : box ] ( right panel ) in order to measure the proper motions of these relatively well - defined structures .",

    "the flux images are not adjusted to compensate for possible registration error . as described in section [ sec : errors ] , we find that the relative registration errors of the images taken at different times are about 0.5 arcsec , which has only minor effects on the proper - motion measurements",

    "[ fig : proj ] , we can clearly see the displacements of the edge positions with time for boxes ( a ) and ( d ) , while such displacements , if any , appear smaller for the other boxes .    in order to quantify the displacement of a projection profile with respect to the last - epoch ( the year 2011 ) pointing that has the longest exposure time , we search the best - matched shift position in the following way ( see e.g. , @xcite ) . by treating the last - epoch profile as  model \" , we shift the model profile and compare it with a profile in another epoch .",

    "the @xmath30 statistical error is set as the range of position shift that satisfies @xmath31 .",
    "the systematic errors are supposed to come from the absolute positional uncertainties of source coordinates in the _ chandra _ observations .",
    "nominal uncertainty of the registration is known as 0.6  at 90% confidence level . to confirm whether the registration of our _ chandra _ data is accurate at this level , we checked misalignments of field point - like sources , which can be regarded as being fixed on the sky for our purpose .",
    "then the misalignments of these point - like sources can be taken as the observation - specific systematic error .",
    "we detect point - like sources by using wavdetect of ciao and picked up 10 useful sources based on the criteria that they are bright enough and located within 6  from the observation pointing center .",
    "note the point spread function is worse at large off - axis angles , resulting in large uncertainty of the detected point - like source position .",
    "setting the coordinates of the point - like sources detected in 2011 as fiducial values , the systematic error can be obtained by calculating rms ( root mean square ) of misalignments between the fiducial coordinates and source coordinates detected in other observations .",
    "the average of these rms values is 0.53 ; the maximum one is 0.75  in 2000 and the minimum one is 0.45  in 2005 .",

    "boxes ( a ) and ( d ) exhibit fast proper motions , 3900 @xmath33 300 km s@xmath34 and 2900 @xmath33 200 km s@xmath34 , respectively ( table  [ tab : tab2 ] ) . note that other boxes may have significant flux variability , making the result of the angular velocity in these cases less reliable .",
    "it also should be noted that the variation of the obtained proper - motion velocities in table  [ tab : tab2 ] can stem from the effect of the projection along the line of sight and/or interactions with the inhomogeneous medium ( e.g.  with dense clouds ) .",
    "collisions with dense clouds can produce secondary shock waves with a reduced shock speed .",
    "the proper - motion velocities are significantly different between box ( c ) and ( d ) although these two boxes seem to be located on the same filamentary structure",
    ". this may be because box ( d ) is moving inside a void - like region with very low density gas @xcite , resulting in a faster propagation speed .",
    "since box ( a ) appears to be located at the outer boundary of , the outer shock wave is supposed to be present at this position .",
    "also , the proper motion measurement for box ( a ) is likely most reliable given the reasonable @xmath35 .",
    "for these reasons , we assume the proper motion speed of box ( a ) , 3900 @xmath33 300 km s@xmath34 , corresponds to the blast - wave shock velocity of  in the nw shell . in  [ sec : models ] and  [ sec : discussion ] , we discuss the evolution models based on this result , assuming the velocity found in box ( a ) is the representative of the outer blast - wave shock speed .",
    "the evolution of nonradiative snrs , from ejecta - dominated ( ed ) phase to sedov - taylor ( st ) phase , can be expressed by a single unified solution ( @xcite ) . in this section ,",
    "we investigate the parameters of snr  by combining the analytic solution of snr evolution models with the observed quantities .",
    "we assume that the interactions with molecular clouds @xcite have not yet affected the motion of the main blast wave of the remnant , and the evolution of  can be described by the solution for spherically symmetric and nonradiative snrs .",
    "@xcite described the evolution of spherically symmetric and nonradiative snrs from the ed stage to the st stage .",
    "in particular , the case of the homogeneous ambient medium was investigated in detail .",

    "the ejecta is devided into two portions consisting of _ core _ with uniform density and _ envelope _ with power - law density profile in the framework of @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the physical behavior depends on whether the reverse shock is in the core or in the envelope .",
    "thus the early stage of snr evolution can be classified into three stages ; ejecta - dominated stage with the reverse shock in the envelope ( hereafter , ed - envelope stage ) ; ed stage with the reverse shock in the core ( ed - core stage ) ; and sedov - taylor stage with the reverse shock in the core ( st stage ) . the model with @xmath46 larger than 5",

    "for instance , the model with @xmath47 would be appropriate for a typical type ia supernova @xcite , and the model with @xmath48 represents a typical type ii supernova @xcite .",

    "these ranges are consistent with the age expected from the association with sn393 : @xmath118 years for the fiducial year of 2011 .",
    "our age estimate depends only weakly on the distance , @xmath70 , which is assumed to be 1 kpc in this paper .",
    "the uncertainty of the distance , up to @xmath119 , can change the age estimate by less than 5% .    [",

    "@xcite estimated the total x - ray emitting ejecta mass to be roughly @xmath121 using the thermal x - ray line emissions .",
    "it is interesting to compare the mass estimate with the reverse - shocked ejecta mass ( @xmath96 ) in our models , which can be calculated by integrating the density profile of ejecta from the contact discontinuity position to the reverse shock position .",
    "however , the x - ray emitting mass would not be taken as the total reverse - shocked ejecta mass , as also concerned in @xcite .",
    "since the ejecta continues to expand after being shocked by the reverse shock , it is cooled by adiabatic expansion . a part of the ejecta being reverse - shocked in the past may have already been cooled and may not emit x - ray anymore at present .",
    "still we can use @xmath122 as a lower limit to the total shocked ejecta mass . as can be seen in table",
    "[ tab : tab3 ] , the case of @xmath38 generally results in small @xmath96 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : hist ] , the distributions of the snr age after imposing the constraint on the shocked ejecta mass are shown as red histograms .",
    "now we discuss the evolutional phase to which snr  is currently belonging .",
    "there is some ambiguity of the definition of the transition time from the ed stage to the st stage because the transition occurs gradually .",
    "we adopt @xmath99 defined in @xcite for the @xmath38 case and @xmath123 in @xcite as @xmath99 for the @xmath61 case .",
    "we also consider a transition time when the blast - wave - shocked ambient medium mass ( @xmath95 ) becomes equal to the ejecta mass . we express it as @xmath114 .",
    "note that @xmath114 is generally smaller than @xmath99 .    for most of the parameter sets that are within the adopted range ,",
    "the evolutional phase is the ed stage , especially if we use @xmath99 as the transition time ( see table  [ tab : tab5 ] ) .",
    "contrary to what is widely considered , snr  is not in the st stage . because the total energy content of cosmic rays has to be large enough to produce the observed gamma rays regardless of the emission models ( see @xcite ) , a very young evolutional stage in models 1 , 2 , 9 , and 10 where @xmath124 would be inappropriate .",
    "model 3 in table  [ tab : tab3 ] represents one of the best parameter sets , being in good agreement with the observed blast - wave shock velocity , the estimated shocked ejecta mass and the realistic evolutional phase .",
    "furthermore , the age is consistent with sn393 .",
    "note that the models with @xmath38 are hardly reconcilable with the observational constraints .",
    "the ambient density of @xmath125 is most plausible , being consistent with the previous estimates .",
    "we find that the evolution of  has not yet reached the st stage .",
    "its phase is still the ed stage or in the middle of the transition to the st stage .",
    "if indeed so , the highest energy particles at the blast wave do not reach the maximum attainable energy yet .    in table",
    "[ tab : tab4 ] , we show the evolution models for @xmath61 under the assumption that sn393 has produced , as the most likely scenario .",
    "an energetic sn with @xmath126 is difficult to be reconciled with the observational constraints , particularly the evolution phase ; it is too young ( i.e. , @xmath124 ) to accelerate enough amount of the cosmic - ray particles . on the other hand , a less energetic event with @xmath127",
    "is also less likely than with @xmath113 because the revere - shocked mass is not large enough to produce the thermal x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "model 4 in table  [ tab : tab4 ] , which is quite similar to model 3 in table  [ tab : tab3 ] , is fully consistent with the various observational data .",
    "[ tab : tab4 ]",
    "we have measured the proper motions of the edge - like and filamentary structures visible in the nw shell of snr . from the measurement for box ( a ) we deduced the shock velocity in nw region of the snr as @xmath128 , where the distance is estimated as @xmath129 kpc from co observations @xcite .",
    "this relatively fast shock velocity is consistent with the presence of synchrotron x - ray emission ( see @xcite ) and indicates that the ambient density is low , @xmath130 , being compatible with what has been suggested in the literature .    assuming that the shock speed we have measured with _",
    "chandra _ at the outermost edge of the nw shell is the representative of the remnant s outer shock wave as a whole , we have confronted our measurements as well as some previous results with the analytic solution of the hydrodynamical properties of snrs .",
    "we estimated the age of the remnant to be 1580 to 2100 years ( a 90% confidence interval ) for the circumstellar wind model ; the age estimate is almost unaffected by the relatively small uncertainty of the distance .",
    "our x - ray measurements support the association with sn393 proposed by @xcite . a model with sn kinetic energy of @xmath2 , the ejecta mass of @xmath131 , and the ambient density at the current blast wave location of @xmath4 , provides reasonable explanation for the observed quantities .",
    "we stress that the transition to the st phase is incomplete , @xmath132 , for any reasonable set of parameters .",
    "generally , the maximum energy of accelerated protons is thought to reach its maximum at the beginning of the st phase .",
