    "although ch@xmath0 was first discovered in interstellar space nearly 70 years ago @xcite , the mechanism by which this simple molecule forms has remained elusive . this is because many theoretical chemical models have been unable to reproduce the large observed abundance of ch@xmath0 in diffuse cloud sight lines . at present , it is thought that ch@xmath0 is primarily formed by the reaction @xmath8 however , this reaction is highly endothermic ( @xmath9  @xmath10  s@xmath11 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , such that non - equilibrium chemistry must be invoked in order for it to proceed rapidly enough to produce the observed amounts of ch@xmath0 , without vastly overproducing observed abundances of oh .    over the past several decades , various theories have been proposed to account for an increased rate of reaction ( [ reach2pluscp ] ) , including , but not limited to , neutral shocks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) shocks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , alfvn waves @xcite , and turbulent dissipation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while both neutral and mhd shocks seem to have been ruled out by observations @xcite , turbulent dissipation and alfvn waves in diffuse clouds remain viable mechanisms by which the rate of reaction ( [ reach2pluscp ] ) may be increased , and there is no clear reason to favor one theory over the other at present .      to place constraints on the physical conditions of the interstellar medium ( ism ) where ch@xmath0 forms  and potentially discriminate between the various proposed formation mechanisms",
    " we have investigated the reaction network linking ch@xmath0 and ch@xmath1 , and made / obtained observations searching for both species . in diffuse molecular clouds the carbon chemistry is either initiated by reaction ( [ reach2pluscp ] ) , or by the radiative association reaction @xmath12 which `` bypasses '' ch@xmath0 production .",
    "the branching fraction between these reactions is temperature dependent , and reaction ( [ reach2pluscp ] ) will dominate when collision temperatures are greater than about 400  k. assuming ch@xmath0 _ is _ formed , it will react with molecular hydrogen , @xmath13 and eventually form ch@xmath1 via @xmath14 in addition to reaction ( [ reacch2plush2 ] ) though , the ch@xmath2 intermediary is also destroyed by dissociative recombination with electrons @xmath15 thus decreasing the ch@xmath1 production rate .",
    "dissociative recombination with electrons also happens to be the primary process by which ch@xmath1 is destroyed : @xmath16 ( there are multiple product channels for reactions ( [ reacch2pluseall ] ) and ( [ reacch3pluseall ] ) , but our analysis only depends on the overall dissociative recombination rates ) .",
    "while ch@xmath1 will be formed starting from both reactions ( [ reach2cphv ] ) and ( [ reacchplush2 ] ) , the latter process will dominate in clouds containing ch@xmath0 ( @xmath17 , where @xmath18  @xmath19  s@xmath11 @xcite , @xmath20  @xmath19  s@xmath11 @xcite , @xmath21 @xcite , and @xmath22 @xcite ) . because we are studying cloud components with ch@xmath0 , we omit reaction ( [ reach2cphv ] ) from our analysis . note , though ,",
    "that if ch@xmath1 were observed in a cloud component lacking ch@xmath0 , the following analysis would not be applicable .",
    "assuming steady state for both ch@xmath2 and ch@xmath1 , we can derive a relation between the concentrations of ch@xmath1 and ch@xmath0 , given by @xmath23 here , the @xmath24 s are the rate coefficients for reaction @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the molecular hydrogen fraction ( where @xmath27 ) , and @xmath28 is the electron fraction ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "the rate coefficients used in this study are @xmath30  @xmath19  s@xmath11 @xcite , @xmath31  @xmath19  s@xmath11 @xcite , and @xmath32  @xmath19  s@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite note that @xmath33 was determined using vibrationally excited ch@xmath1",
    ". the rate coefficient for dissociative recombination from the ground vibrational state  the only state likely to be populated in diffuse cloud conditions  may differ from the above experimental value by about a factor of 3 .",
    "because of this possibility , during our analysis we also consider using @xmath34 and @xmath35 in equation ( [ eqch3chratio ] ) .    aside from the electron fraction",
    " estimated to be @xmath36 in diffuse clouds via c@xmath0 observations @xcite  equation ( [ eqch3chratio ] ) is dependent only on the molecular hydrogen fraction and the temperature ( through the rate coefficients @xmath37 and @xmath33 ) . as a result",
    ", the ratio between the abundances of ch@xmath1 and ch@xmath0 is governed by the interstellar physical parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "observations of ch@xmath0 and ch@xmath1 can thus be used to infer the physical conditions in the ism where these molecules reside .",
    "we selected the cyg ob2 no . 12 sight line for this study because it combines a large extinction ( @xmath38 ; * ? ? ? * ) and thus gas column , with a background star that is bright enough at both optical and infrared wavelengths such that the observations described below are possible .",
    "however , there is some contention as to whether the sight line mainly probes diffuse or dense material , environments which have different electron fractions .",
    "rotational excitation analyses have been performed using c@xmath39 observations , and the resulting inferred hydrogen number densities are between @xmath40  @xmath41 and @xmath42  @xmath41 @xcite , typical of diffuse clouds . also",
    ", the non - detection of h@xmath39o and co@xmath39 ices by @xcite led to the conclusion that there was a lack of dense molecular gas along the sight line . on the other hand , radio observations of hco@xmath0 @xcite and @xmath43co @xcite",
    "suggest that portions of the sight line may pass through denser clumps as proposed by @xcite .",
    "additionally , @xcite show that dense clumps can still be present even with the aforementioned c@xmath39 analyses .",
    "because we are examining the chemistry related to ch@xmath0 , a species thought to reside mainly in diffuse gas with @xmath44 @xcite , we adopt the diffuse molecular cloud model for our analysis .",
    "however , in section 4 we also consider a reduced electron fraction in order to investigate the effects of varying this parameter .",
    "observations toward cyg ob2 no .",
    "12 and the atmospheric standard @xmath46  cyg were made on 1999 nov 19 using the cgs4 spectrometer @xcite at ukirt . the spectrometer was used with its echelle grating , 0.6  wide slit , and long camera to yield a resolving power of about 37,000 , and a circular variable filter ( cvf ) was employed to select the correct order .",
    "spectra were centered to cover the @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 ro - vibrational transitions of ch@xmath1 at 3.18523  @xmath50 m , 3.19578  @xmath50 m , and 3.18777  @xmath50 m ( vacuum wavelengths ) , respectively @xcite .",
    "stars were nodded along the slit in an abba pattern with total integration times of 864  s for cyg ob2 no .",
    "12 and 672  s for @xmath46  cyg .",
    "individual frames were processed using starlink s orac - dr pipeline , specifically designed to handle ukirt data .",
    "spectra were then extracted from the resultant group frame ( the combination of all integrations for a given target ) using noao s iraf package , and imported to igor pro where we have macros set up to complete the reduction @xcite . here , artifacts from the data acquisition methods were removed , spectra were wavelength calibrated using telluric lines , and the science target spectra were divided by the telluric standard spectra to remove atmospheric absorption features .",
    "the resulting normalized spectrum of cyg ob2 no .",
    "12 is shown in figure [ figch3plus ] .      the @xmath52@xmath53(0 - 0 ) and @xmath52@xmath53(1 - 0 ) transitions of ch@xmath0 ( 4232.548    and 3957.692   , respectively ; * ? ? ? * ) and the @xmath52@xmath53(0 - 0 ) transition of ch ( 4300.308   ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , were observed simultaneously using the hires instrument at keck @xcite by g. blake and collaborators .",
    "observations toward cyg ob2 no .",
    "12 were performed on 1999 jun 17 and 18 with a slit width of 0.57  , producing a resolving power of about 70,000 .",
    "the total integration time on source was 8400  s.    using iraf , the profile of the overscan region was subtracted from each image , and the frames were averaged together with the _ cosmic ray reject _ option enabled .",
    "the relevant orders ( 10 , 16 , & 17 ) were extracted using _ apall _ with background subtraction enabled , resulted in intensities below zero at the centers of ca  ii lines near 3934 and 3968   .",
    "this is most likely due to the low flux and low signal - to - noise ratio of this order .",
    "a curve of growth analysis ( see section 3.2 ) using the equivalent width of the 3957.692    line from this uncorrected spectrum resulted in no value of the doppler parameter for which the column densities determined from the @xmath52@xmath53(0 - 0 ) and @xmath52@xmath53(1 - 0 ) absorption lines agreed . to remedy these unphysical results , we shifted the spectrum of order 10 so that the deeper ca  ii line had zero intensity . ] , and normalized using the _ continuum _ routine .",
    "these astronomical spectra were then imported to igor pro , along with thorium - argon arc lamp spectra used for wavelength calibration .",
    "after calibration , observed wavelengths were converted to lsr velocities , and the resulting spectra are shown in figure [ figchplus ] .",
    "the spectrum in figure [ figch3plus ] shows no indication of absorption from any of the ch@xmath1 transitions considered .",
    "upper limits on the equivalent widths were computed using @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the standard deviation on the continuum of the spectrum , @xmath56 is the wavelength per pixel , and @xmath57 is the number of pixels expected in an absorption feature given a full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of 12.4  km  s@xmath11 ( average fwhm measured for the ch@xmath0 and ch lines ) . the upper limits on column densities were then calculated using the standard relation between equivalent width and column .",
    "the results of this analysis are shown in table [ tblch3plus ] .",
    "the ch@xmath0 and ch spectra in figure [ figchplus ] show broad and deep absorption profiles . while it is known that there are multiple velocity components toward cyg ob2 no .",
    "12 , the low signal - to - noise ratios of the ch and ch@xmath0 spectra make fitting multiple components to the observed absorption features highly uncertain . because there is no unique way to fit any of the absorption features with 3 separate components , we simply found the equivalent widths of each feature as a whole . using these equivalent widths , we first computed lower limits to the column densities of both species by assuming that the lines are optically thin .",
    "as this assumption is most likely incorrect , we also computed column densities using a curve of growth analysis .",
    "both ch@xmath0 lines arise from the same lower energy state , and so should result in the same column density . plotting",
    "the column density vs. the doppler parameter , @xmath58 , for both lines , we found that the curves intersect at @xmath59  km  s@xmath11 and @xmath60  @xmath61 within the uncertainties of the equivalent widths ( the positive uncertainty associated with @xmath58 was computed from the average fwhm of the ch@xmath0 lines and the relation @xmath62 ) ) . assuming that @xmath59  km  s@xmath11 is also applicable to ch",
    ", we computed @xmath63  @xmath61 .",
    "all of these results , as well as the various line parameters , are shown in table [ tblchplus ] .      using both ch@xmath0 and ch@xmath1 observations , and assuming that the two species have the same distribution along the line of sight ( i.e. @xmath64 ) , equation ( [ eqch3chratio ] )",
    "can be used to constrain the temperature and molecular fraction of the gas where these species reside",
    ". however , equation ( [ eqch3chratio ] ) requires the _ total _ abundance of ch@xmath1 , whereas we only have upper limits for the column densities of three particular states . as a result",
    ", the equation must be recast such that the left hand side is the ratio between the column density of an individual state of ch@xmath1 with the total column of ch@xmath0 .",
    "this is achieved by using the partition function for ch@xmath1 ( computed using molecular constants from @xcite and @xcite ) to calculate the fractional population , @xmath65 , in each individual state as a function of temperature .",
    "the definition @xmath66 is then substituted into equation ( [ eqch3chratio ] ) , giving @xmath67 using the observed ch@xmath0 column and the individual @xmath68 upper limits for ch@xmath1 , we can put three separate upper limits on the left hand side of the equation .",
    "the ( @xmath69 ) parameter space can then be explored to determine which molecular fraction  temperature combinations are excluded by our observations .",
    "this analysis is shown in figure [ figftexclude ] .",
    "it is quite clear from figure [ figftexclude ] that our analysis using ch@xmath0 and ch@xmath1 observations excludes a large portion of the ( @xmath69 ) parameter space . indeed ,",
    "typical diffuse molecular cloud conditions ( @xmath5 , @xmath6  k ) are excluded by our upper limits to the column densities of all three observed ch@xmath1 transitions . while this may not be especially surprising",
    " equilibrium chemistry in diffuse clouds is unable to account for the large abundances of ch@xmath0  our observations add a new , independent method for determining that ch@xmath0 can not form under such conditions .",
    "however , as mentioned in section 1.2 , the dissociative recombination rate coefficient for ch@xmath1 with electrons , @xmath33 , is most likely uncertain by a factor of about 3 .",
    "if we allow variations between @xmath34 and @xmath35 during our analysis using @xmath70 with equation ( [ eqch3jkchratio ] ) , the dashed and dotted contours in figure [ figftexclude ] result , respectively . with @xmath35",
    "essentially every temperature is excluded when the molecular fraction is greater than 0.1 . for @xmath34 ,",
    "high molecular fractions are allowed as the temperature increases beyond a few hundred kelvin .",
    "even with this higher rate coefficient though , most typical diffuse molecular clouds conditions are still excluded by this analysis .",
    "while we have assumed diffuse cloud conditions throughout our analysis and given reasons for doing so , we feel it is prudent to revisit the dense clump scenario described in section 2.1 . for the sake of completeness",
    ", we examine the effects that a lower electron fraction ( due to denser material ) would have on our analysis .",
    "if we decrease the electron fraction by a factor of 10 to @xmath71 ( still much higher than @xmath72 assumed in dense clouds @xcite ) , then interstellar clouds with @xmath73 and @xmath74 are excluded .",
    "this demonstrates that as @xmath28 decreases , regions with even smaller molecular hydrogen fractions are ruled out by our analysis .",
    "a potentially larger uncertainty in our analysis is that we only consider a single kinetic temperature of the gas , and do not account for any non - equilibrium effects .",
    "if ions are magnetically accelerated relative to neutrals , our analysis changes drastically .",
    "assuming an effective temperature for collisions can be described as @xcite @xmath75 where @xmath50 is the reduced mass of collision partners , @xmath76 is boltzmann s constant , and @xmath77 is the turbulent velocity ( about 3.3 km s@xmath11 accoring to * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the effective temperatures for collisions of ch@xmath1 with h@xmath39 and h are about 800  k and 400  k higher , respectively , than the kinetic temperature of the gas .",
    "these higher temperatures are important because it is generally assumed that the fractional populations of ch@xmath1 states are `` thermalized '' by collisions with h and h@xmath39 . if collision temperatures are hundreds of kelvin instead of @xmath7860  k , then the expected populations of the ( 1,0 ) , ( 1,1 ) , and ( 2,2 ) states we observed are significantly decreased . in this case , our analysis is unable to exclude any significant portion of the ( @xmath69 ) parameter space .    to use our method of analysis assuming high effective temperatures due to accelerated ions , new observations must be made .",
    "such observations should cover the 3 transitions we have already examined , search for absorption due to higher energy states of ch@xmath1 , and obtain a higher signal - to - noise ratio in all cases .",
    "if absorption from ch@xmath1 can be detected , instead of only excluding portions of ( @xmath69 ) space , we will be able to constrain the conditions where ch@xmath0 _ does _ form .",
    "we have used observations of ch@xmath1 and ch@xmath0 toward the diffuse molecular cloud sight line cyg ob2 no . 12 in an attempt to constrain the physical conditions of the ism where these species reside .",
    "if we assume equilibrium chemistry , our analysis excludes the portion of ( @xmath69 ) parameter space corresponding to average diffuse molecular clouds .",
    "this acts as an important independent check on previous studies which also concluded that the slow rate of ch@xmath0 formation ruled out equilibrium chemistry in such environments .",
    "however , our analysis can not exclude non - equilibrium effects in diffuse clouds , and neither supports nor refutes any of the current proposed theories for ch@xmath0 formation .",
    "to do so , new observations of ch@xmath1 with signal - to - noise ratios much higher than those obtained in this study ( @xmath79 ) would be required .",
    "also , it would be highly advantageous if the dissociative recombination rate coefficient for ch@xmath1 were measured at low vibrational temperatures , i.e. for the ground vibrational state .",
