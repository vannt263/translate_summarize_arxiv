    "wronskians ( or wronskian determinants ) are most useful for the analysis of ordinary differential equations in general@xcite and the schrdinger equation in particular@xcite .",
    "whitton and connor@xcite applied a remarkable wronskian formalism to resonance tunnelling reactions and we have recently proposed that a closely related method may be suitable for teaching quantum scattering in advanced undergraduate and graduate courses in quantum mechanics@xcite .    the purpose of this paper is to show that the wronskian method is also useful for the study of bound states of one  dimensional quantum  mechanical models .",
    "we believe that this variant of the approach is also suitable for pedagogical purposes and enables a unified treatment of the discrete and continuous spectra of simple quantum  mechanical models .",
    "in section  [ sec : schro ] we convert the schrdinger equation into a dimensionless eigenvalue equation and show how to apply the wronskian method to bound states . in section  [ sec : examples ] we illustrate the application of the approach by means of two suitable examples . in section  [ sec : conclusions ] we outline the main results of the paper and draw conclusions .",
    "finally , in an appendix we outline the main properties of wronskians that are relevant to present discussion .",
    "before solving the schrdinger equation it is a good practice to convert it into a dimensionless eigenvalue equation . in this way one removes all the physical constants and reduces the number of model parameters to a minimum . the time ",
    "independent schrdinger equation for a particle of mass @xmath0 that moves in one dimension ( @xmath1 ) under the effect of a potential @xmath2 is @xmath3 where a prime indicates derivative with respect to the coordinate .",
    "if we define the dimensionless coordinate @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is an appropriate length scale , then we obtain the dimensionless eigenvalue equation @xmath6 the length unit @xmath5 that renders both @xmath7 and @xmath8 dimensionless is arbitrary and we can choose it in such a way that makes the schrdinger equation simpler .",
    "we will see some examples in section  [ sec : examples ] .",
    "it is well known that a general solution to the second  order differential equation ( [ eq : schro_dim ] ) can be written as a linear combination of two linearly independent solutions .",
    "here we write @xmath9 where the solutions @xmath10 and @xmath11 satisfy @xmath12 at a given point @xmath13 in @xmath14 .",
    "these conditions are sufficient to ensure that @xmath10 and @xmath11 are linearly independent@xcite .    for every value of the dimensionless energy @xmath7 we know",
    "that @xmath15 where @xmath5 and @xmath16 stand for left and right and @xmath17 and @xmath18 for convergent and divergent , respectively .",
    "it means that , for arbitrary @xmath7 , the wavefunction is a linear combination of a convergent and a divergent function when @xmath19 . if , for a particular value of @xmath7 , @xmath20 then the resulting wavefunction is square integrable .",
    "in other words , this condition determines the energies of the discrete spectrum .",
    "it follows from the wronskian properties outlined in the appendix that @xmath21 therefore , when @xmath20 we have a linear homogeneous system of two equations with two unknowns : @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "there will be nontrivial solutions provided that its determinant vanishes @xmath24 the roots of this equation @xmath25 , @xmath26 are the energies of the bound states ( discrete spectrum ) .",
    "when the potential is parity invariant @xmath27 and @xmath28 then @xmath10 and @xmath11 are even and odd functions , respectively .",
    "in this case we have @xmath29 and the determinant ( [ eq : quant_cond_gen ] ) takes a simpler form : @xmath30 .",
    "we appreciate that the even and odd solutions are clearly separate and their eigenvalues are given by @xmath31 respectively .",
    "besides , we need to consider only the interval @xmath32 .    commonly , it is not difficult to derive approximate expressions for the convergent and divergent asymptotic forms of the wavefunction because they are straightforwardly determined by the asymptotic behavior of the potential @xmath8 . therefore , it only remains to have sufficiently accurate expressions for @xmath10 and @xmath11 and their derivatives in order to obtain the eigenvalues by means of equation  ( [ eq : quant_cond_gen ] ) .",
    "this problem is easily solved by means of , for example , a suitable numerical integration method@xcite .",
    "if @xmath33 stands for either @xmath10 or @xmath11 then such an approach gives us its values at a set of points @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the number of steps of size @xmath37 to the left and right of @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "the number of steps should be sufficiently large so that @xmath33 reaches its asymptotic value at both @xmath38 and @xmath39 and @xmath40 should be sufficiently small to provide a good representation of @xmath33 .",
    "the numerical integration methods also yield the derivative of the function @xmath41 at the same set of points which facilitates the calculation of the wronskians .",
    "in order to test the accuracy of the wronskian method we first choose the exactly solvable problem given by the potential @xmath42 , where @xmath43 and @xmath44 . if we set @xmath45 we are led to the dimensionless schrdinger equation ( [ eq : schro_dim ] ) where @xmath46 note that the dimensionless energy @xmath47 depends on only one independent potential parameter @xmath48 .",
    "the units of length and energy are @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively , and we do not have to bother about the mass of the particle and the planck constant when solving the differential equation .",
    "the allowed dimensionless energies are given by@xcite @xmath51 and the spectrum is continuous for all @xmath52 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath53 as @xmath54 and there is only one bound state when @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) . as @xmath48 increases more bound states appear . as a result",
    "there are critical values of the potential parameter for which @xmath57 that are given by the condition @xmath58 or @xmath59 .    since @xmath60 then in this case @xmath61 and @xmath62 , where @xmath63 ( we only consider the interval @xmath64 because the potential is parity invariant ) .",
    "consequently , the allowed energies are determined by the conditions @xmath65 e^{-kx}=0,\\;x\\rightarrow \\infty   \\nonumber \\\\",
    "w(r_{c},s ) & = & \\left [ s^{\\prime } ( x)+ks(x)\\right ] e^{-kx}=0,\\;x\\rightarrow \\infty   \\label{eq : quant_cond_even_odd_2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for even and odd states , respectively .",
    "since the potential ( [ eq : v(x)_cosh ] ) is parity invariant we integrate the schrdinger equation from @xmath28 to @xmath66 .",

    "this potential is also parity invariant and vanishes asymptotically as @xmath19 so that the calculation is similar to the preceding example . in order to show that the wronskian method also applies successfully to this model we first obtain some critical values of the potential parameter @xmath48 .",

    "although as accurate as one may desire ( or the computer allows ) , are not exact ; therefore we can make the coefficient of the divergent part of the wavefunction very small but never exactly equal to zero . to illustrate this point we consider the ground state of the gaussian well with @xmath88 and obtain the approximate energy @xmath89 by means of a naive bracketing algorithm .",
    "the wronskian method gives us the coefficient of the divergent part of the wavefunction @xmath90 as a by  product of the calculation at @xmath75 .",
    "note that in this case @xmath91 and @xmath92 so that @xmath10 is the unnormalized approximation to @xmath93 . fig .",

    ", width=340 ]    we can improve the calculation and make @xmath97 as small as desired , but it will never be exactly zero because the numerical calculation is approximate and the spurious divergent part will always be present .",
    "however , in order to normalize the wavefunction and calculate expectation values we judiciously truncate the coordinate interval at a convenient point and obtain finite accurate values for those quantities .",
    "the wronskian method is clearly suitable for deciding on the truncation point and estimating the error .",
    "in our opinion the wronskian method is sufficiently clear and straightforward for teaching an advanced undergraduate or graduate course in quantum mechanics .",
    "the mathematics requires no special background beyond an introductory calculus course .",
    "since many available computer softwares offer numerical integration methods the programming effort is relatively light .    from a purely theoretical point of view",
    "the method is suitable for the discussion of the convergent and divergent asymptotic behaviors of the wavefunction and for illustrating how the allowed bound ",
    "state energies make the divergent part vanish leading to square  integrable wavefunctions .",
    "the students may try other quantum  mechanical models , derive the appropriate asymptotic behaviors analytically and then test their results by means of a suitable computer program .",
    "they can verify that the wronskians already approach constants as the absolute value of the coordinate increases and that the wavefunction already looks like a square integrable function when the coefficient of the divergent contribution is almost zero .",
    "they can even estimate the remnants of the asymptotic divergent part because the wronskian method provides the necessary coefficients .",
    "in addition to it , the wronskian method is also suitable for quantum scattering@xcite allowing a unified treatment of both the discrete and continuous spectra of the model",
    ".    finally , we point out that computer algebra systems are remarkable aids for the teaching and learning process because they facilitate the algebraic treatment of the problem and even offer the possibility of straightforward numerical calculations ( although they are considerably slower than specialized numerical programs ) .",
    "in order to make this paper sufficiently self  contained in this appendix we outline some well known results about the wronskians that are useful for the study of ordinary differential equations in general@xcite and also for the treatment of the schrdinger equation in particular@xcite . to this end",
