    "from observations of light element abundances and of the cosmic microwave background radiation @xcite the cosmic baryon asymmetry , @xmath1 , ( where @xmath2 is the entropy density ) can be inferred .",
    "the conditions for a dynamical generation of this asymmetry ( baryogenesis ) are well known @xcite and depending on how they are realized different scenarios for baryogenesis can be defined ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a througout discussion ) .",
    "leptogenesis @xcite is a scenario in which an initial lepton asymmetry , generated in the out - of - equilibrium decays of heavy singlet majorana neutrinos ( @xmath3 ) , is partially converted in a baryon asymmetry by anomalous sphaleron interactions  @xcite that are standard model processes .",
    "singlet majorana neutrinos are an essential ingredient for the generation of light neutrino masses through the seesaw mechanism @xcite .",
    "this means that if the seesaw is the source of neutrino masses then qualitatively , leptogenesis is unavoidable .",
    "consequently , whether the baryon asymmetry puzzle can be solved within this framework turn out to be a quantitative question . this has triggered a great deal of interest on quantitative analysis of the standard leptogenesis model and indeed a lot of progress during the last years has been achieved ( see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the model we consider here @xcite is a simple extension of the standard model containing a set of @xmath4 fermionic singlets , namely three right - handed neutrinos ( @xmath5 ) and three heavy vectorlike fields ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "in addition , we assume that at some high energy scale , taken to be of the order of the leptogenesis scale @xmath0 , an exact @xmath7 gauge horizontal symmetry forbids direct couplings of the lepton @xmath8 and higgs @xmath9 doublets to the heavy majorana neutrinos @xmath3 . at lower energies ,",
    "@xmath7 gets spontaneously broken by the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath10 of a @xmath11 singlet scalar field @xmath12 .",
    "accordingly , the yukawa interactions of the high energy lagrangian read @xmath13 we use greek indices @xmath14 to label the heavy majorana neutrinos , latin indices @xmath15 for the vectorlike messengers , and @xmath16 for the lepton flavors @xmath17 . following reference @xcite we chose the simple @xmath7 charge assignments",
    "@xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "this assignment is sufficient to enforce the absence of @xmath21 terms , but clearly it does not constitute an attempt to reproduce the fermion mass pattern , and accordingly we will also avoid assigning specific charges to the right - handed leptons and quark fields that have no relevance for our analysis . as discussed in  @xcite , depending on the hierarchy between the relevant scales of the model ( @xmath22 ) , quite different _ scenarios _ for leptogenesis can arise : @xmath23 ) for @xmath24 , we recover the standard leptogenesis ( sl ) case that will not discuss .",
    "@xmath25 ) for @xmath26 we obtain the purely flavored leptogenesis ( pfl ) case , that corresponds to the situation , when the flavor symmetry @xmath7 is still unbroken during the leptogenesis era and at the same time the messengers @xmath27 are too heavy to be produced in @xmath28 decays and scatterings , and can be integrated away ( for other possibilities see ref .",
    "after @xmath7 and electroweak symmetry breaking the set of yukawa interactions in ( [ eq : lag ] ) generates light neutrino masses through the effective mass operator . the resulting mass matrix can be written as @xcite @xmath29_{ij }    = \\left [      \\tilde{\\lambda}^{t}\\frac{v^{2}}{m_{n}}\\tilde{\\lambda }    \\right]_{ij } \\,.\\ ] ] here we have introduced the seesaw - like couplings @xmath30 .",
    "note that , in contrast to the standard seesaw , the neutrino mass matrix is of fourth order in the _ fundamental _ yukawa couplings ( @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) and due to the factor @xmath33 is even more suppressed .",
    "in the case when @xmath34 , two - body @xmath28 decays are kinematically forbidden . however , via off - shell exchange of the heavy @xmath27 fields , @xmath28 can decay to the three body final states @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the cp asymmetry is obtained from the interference between the tree level and loop diagrams ; and reads @xcite : @xmath37}{\\left(\\tilde{\\lambda}\\tilde{\\lambda}^{\\dagger}\\right)_{11}},\\ ] ] where @xmath38 .",
    "the cp asymmetries in ( [ eq : cp ] ) have the following properties : @xmath39 @xmath40 . @xmath41 the total cp asymmetry @xmath42 .",
    "this is because @xmath43_{11}=0 $ ] , and is related to the fact that the loop does no involve lepton number violation . @xmath44",
    "rescaling the couplings @xmath31 and @xmath32 by a parameter @xmath45 according to : @xmath46 ; enhances the cp asymmetries as @xmath47 @xcite .        in the bolztmann equations ( be ) ,",
    "the particles densities are written in terms of the entropy density @xmath2 , i.e @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the number density for the particle @xmath50 .",

    "the total reaction densities that determine the washout rates for the different flavors are shown in the first panel in figure  [ rates - yl - fig ] . since pfl is defined by the condition that the sum of the flavor cp asymmetry vanishes ( @xmath80 ) , it is the hierarchy between these washout rates that in the end is the responsible for generating a net lepton number asymmetry .",
