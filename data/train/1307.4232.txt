    "the electron cloud develops quickly as photons , striking the vacuum chamber wall , knock out electrons which are subsequently accelerated by the beam and strike the chamber again , producing further electrons in an avalanche process .",
    "most studies @xcite performed so far were based on computer simulations ( e.g. ecloud @xcite ) taking into account photoelectron production , secondary electron emission , electron dynamics , and space charge effects , and providing a very detailed description of the electron cloud evolution . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that , for the typical parameters of the _ relativistic heavy ion collider _ ( rhic ) , the evolution of the longitudinal electron cloud density evolution from bunch to bunch can be described ( locally , i.e. , at an arbitrary chosen point along the beam path ) specific by a simple `` cubic map '' of the form :    @xmath0    where @xmath1 is the average electron cloud density after the @xmath2-th passage of the bunch . a similar map was next suggested and found to be reliable also for the _ large hadron collider _ ( lhc ) @xcite .",
    "the coefficients @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 are extrapolated from simulations , and are functions of the beam parameters and of the beam pipe features .",
    "the linear term describes the linear growth and the coefficient @xmath3 is larger than unity in the presence of electron cloud formation .",
    "the quadratic term describes the space charge effects , and is negative reflecting the concavity to the curve @xmath6 vs @xmath1 .",
    "the cubic term corresponds to a variety of subtler effects , acting as perturbations to the above simple scenario .    from figure [ fig1 ]",
    "one can see that the bunch - to - bunch evolution contains enough informations about the build - up or the decay time , although the details of the line electron density oscillation between two bunches are lost .",
    "the average longitudinal electron density as function of time grows exponentially until the space charge due to the electrons themselves produces a saturation level .",
    "once the saturation level is reached the average electron density does not change significantly .",
    "the final decay corresponds to the empty interval between successive bunches .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the behavior of the average electron density @xmath6 as function of the average electron density @xmath7 for different values of the bunch population ( number of particles in a bunch , @xmath8 ) .",

    "the lines correspond to cubic fits .",
    "the red line corresponds to the identity map @xmath10 . by comparison with fig . 1",
    ", points above this line describe the initial growth and saturation of the bunch - to - bunch evolution of the electron density , those below describe the decay .",

    "[ fig2 ] were obtained from ecloud ; the lines are the cubic fits among these points .",
    "the electron cloud dynamics can be roughly described as follows : starting with a small initial linear electron density , after some bunches the density takes off and reaches the corresponding saturation line ( @xmath10 , red line ) where the space charge effects , due to the electrons in the cloud itself , take place . in this situation , points corresponding to successive passages of filled bunches , are in the same spot .    until recently , the map coefficients have been extrapolated from simulations , in a purely empirical way , so as to obtain the best fit .",
    "an analytical expression of the linear coefficient @xmath3 has been computed in a drift space @xcite , and in the presence of a magnetic dipole field @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we summarize our recent results @xcite on the calculation of an analytical expression for the quadratic coefficient @xmath4 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , under the simple assumptions of round chambers and free - field motion of the electrons in the cloud .",
    "the coefficient @xmath4 turns out to depend on few beam and machine parameters , and can be computed analytically once and for all , saving a huge computational time compared to numerical simulations obtained using ecloud @xcite .",
    "this paper is accordingly organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we calculate the saturation density of cloud electrons , adopting a gaussian - like distribution for the secondary electrons , producing an energy barrier near the chamber wall .",
    "later we deduce the formula for the linear coefficient @xmath3 , already given in @xcite , and also for the quadratic coefficient , which is a new result .",
    "finally we report the conclusions .",
    "electrons in the cloud include both primary electrons , generated by synchrotron radiation at the pipe wall , and secondary electrons , produced by beam induced multi - pactoring .",
    "primary electrons interact with the parent bunch , and are accelerated to a velocity @xmath11 , @xmath12 being the classical electron radius , @xmath13 the pipe radius , and @xmath14 the linear particle density of a longitudinally - uniform ( coasting ) beam having the same total charge as the actual bunched beam , @xmath15 with @xmath16 the intra - bunch spacing , and @xmath17 the bunch length .",
    "secondary electrons are produced with a low ( typically a few @xmath18 ) energy @xmath19 , and move from the pipe wall , with velocity @xmath20 until the next bunch arrives . for large @xmath8 , @xmath21 .",
    "cloud buildup turns out to depend basically on two parameters @xcite : @xmath22 and @xmath23 the parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 are measures of the distances ( in units of the pipe radius @xmath13 ) traveled , respectively , by primary and secondary electrons during the bunch transit time . at low currents , @xmath26 ,",
    "primary electrons interact with several bunches before eventually reaching the wall . in the opposite extreme case ,",
    "@xmath27 , they travel from wall to wall in a single bunch transit - time .",
    "the transition between the two regimes can be expected to occur at @xmath28 .    for @xmath29",
    "secondary electrons are confined in a layer @xmath30 near the pipe wall , and are wiped out of the region @xmath31 close to the beam by each passing bunch .",
    "operating in the range of parameters ( @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) is thus clearly desirable to suppress the adverse effects of the e - cloud on the beam dynamics @xcite . in this range",
