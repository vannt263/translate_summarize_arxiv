    "a significant fraction of the low - mass stars in our galaxy may be born in environments where very massive stars are also present .",
    "the winds and ionising radiation from o - stars could be expected to change the properties of low - mass stellar populations in two ways : by inhibiting low - mass star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and/or by hastening the dispersal of their circumstellar discs @xcite",
    ". however , observations in several nearby ob - associations ( e.g. , the trapezium cluster ) reveal a wealth of low - mass stellar objects , born from the same stellar nursery as the more massive stars .",
    "circumstellar discs are an essential ingredient of low - mass star formation , yet they seem to disappear quickly in nearby star forming regions @xcite .",
    "the timescale for discs to dissipate is crucial in determining whether planets form and on which timescales @xcite , and might control planetesimal migration @xcite .",
    "it is not known which process dominates disc dispersal with likely culprits being viscous accretion , radiation pressure from the central star and from external sources , dust agglomeration and planetesimal formation .",
    "there is observational evidence that luminous o - stars affect circumstellar discs around low - mass stars ( e.g. , the proplyds in orion , @xcite ) , supported by theoretical models of disc photo - evaporation by uv radiation @xcite . judging from l - band disc excesses , low - mass stars in young clusters exhibit extremely high disc frequencies ( @xmath580% , e.g.  the trapezium cluster , @xcite ) up to ages of @xmath61.5myr , which then decrease rapidly with age : at @xmath63myr , 50% of discs have been dissipated , and the timescale for all cluster members to lose their discs is @xmath66myr @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite found that in the starburst cluster ngc3603 disc dissipation occurs on shorter timescales .",
    "it is still not clear whether photo - evaporation is an important contributor to this decline .",
    "we are investigating the low - mass star and disc population in ngc6611 , a young and massive cluster @xcite that is currently ionising the eagle nebula .",
    "it contains a dozen o - stars ( earliest spectral type o4 , @xcite ) , that produce @xmath67 times more ionising ( lyman continuum ) radiation than the trapezium cluster @xcite .",
    "the visual extinction towards ngc6611 is known to be variable @xcite .",
    "estimated distances range between 2@xmath72.6kpc and the cluster age is about 2@xmath73myr ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we have obtained @xmath0 photometry of ngc6611 in order to identify the pre - main sequence ( pms ) population and determine the cluster disc frequency .",
    "our aim is to establish empirically whether the massive stars significantly hasten disc dissipation around solar - mass stars in this cluster .",
    "the complete details of the observing strategy and the reduction procedure for the data sets described here will be discussed in a forthcoming paper ( oliveira et al . in preparation ) ; a summary is presented here .",
    "survey covers the entire star forming region , while the @xmath8 survey covers the area delineated by the white lines . ]",
    "the region containing ngc6611 was surveyed using the wfc at the isaac newton telescope .",
    "observations were taken through gunn i and z filters on the nights of 16@xmath717 july 2002 .",
    "the wfc consists of four ccd detectors ; the camera has 0.33arcsec pixels and a field - of - view ( fov ) of 34arcmin@xmath934arcmin ( with an 11arcmin@xmath911arcmin square missing from the north - west corner ) .",
    "total exposure times are 8@xmath9300s and 8@xmath9400s respectively at i and z ; 20s frames were also obtained in each band to account for the high dynamic range of the objects brightness .",
    "landolt photometric standards were measured and these were used to obtain cousins @xmath10 magnitudes and @xmath11 colours .",
    "the data were reduced in a standard way ( bias subtraction , flatfielding , de - fringing ) .",
    "the data analysis proceeded using the cluster suite of software @xcite .",
    "the external precision of the photometry was tested against @xmath10 magnitudes from the eso eis survey ( s. smartt and c. evans , private communication ) ; it reveals good systematic agreement to better than 0.05mag between 12@xmath4i@xmath419mag ( the faint limit arising from the eis survey ) .",
    "the @xmath8 photometry ( mko - ir system , @xcite ) of ngc6611 was obtained with uist at the uk infrared telescope in june 2003 and june@xmath7august 2004 . in fig.[image ] we show the 6 fields that were observed at ukirt , covering an approximate area of 4arcmin@xmath95arcmin ( fov 2arcmin@xmath92arcmin with 0.12arcsec pixels ) .",
    "the observations in the @xmath12 filters were performed in a standard 9-point dither pattern .",
    "the l@xmath1-band images required 55h of observations to cover the requested area .",
    "these observations were performed with a 4-point dither pattern and with chopping to a nearby field to properly sample the sky background .",
    "the l@xmath1-band images were taken in seeing better than 0.6arcsec and time on source varied between 60@xmath790min , allowing us to reach @xmath13@xmath614mag with signal - to - noise of 10 .",
    "the reduction was performed with orac - dr , the ukirt data reduction and high - level instrument control software .",
    "multi - object photometry was performed on the @xmath8 images using an implementation of daophot ( version ii ) and allstar @xcite within eso - midas . the @xmath12 photometry was calibrated using the 2mass catalogue while standard stars were observed to calibrate the l@xmath1-band photometry .",
    "the astrometry was also performed with relation to the 2mass catalogue .",
    "the first step was to identify the pre - main - sequence population in ngc6611 .",
    "fig.[cmd ] shows the @xmath10/@xmath11 colour - magnitude diagram for the central ( 7arcmin@xmath96arcmin ) area of the cluster .",
    "pms stars are redder than main - sequence stars of similar i - magnitude and therefore the pms appears well separated from the bulk of foreground contamination in this diagram .",
    "the polygon represents the selection domain for a star to be considered a pms candidate .",
    "fig.[cmd ] also shows an equivalent diagram for an area of the same size situated 16arcmin west of the cluster .",
    "the pms is effectively absent ; we estimate foreground contamination to be of the order of 5% .",
    "the fainter magnitude limit of the sample is imposed by the ir observations , i.e. we ensure that for the faintest stars in our sample ( @xmath10=19mag ) we are still able to detect stellar photospheric emission in the l@xmath1-band . at the lower mass end ,",
    "the catalogue is essentially complete ; however objects brighter than @xmath10@xmath612mag are saturated in the i - band images .",
    "the uncertainties in magnitude and colour are generally much better than 0.1mag .",
    "we have identified 259 pms candidates ( with good @xmath14 photometry ) in the area covered by our ir survey .",
    "we estimate that these objects have masses in the range 0.45m@xmath3@xmath15m@xmath157m@xmath3 ( using models by @xcite ) , assuming a distance of 2kpc , an average extinction @xmath16@xmath63.4mag and an age of 3myr @xcite .",
    "circumstellar dust discs are cooler than the stellar photospheres therefore they radiate mainly at ir wavelengths . if a young star has an ir colour in excess of the stellar photosphere this indicates the presence of a circumstellar disc .",
    "traditionally , @xmath17 excesses were used as a disc indicator , but such an excess is only detectable for discs with high accretion rates and low inclinations @xcite . in the l@xmath1-band ( or at longer wavelengths )",
    "the contrast between the stellar photosphere and disc emission is large even for relatively small disc masses @xcite , making it an efficient disc diagnostic @xcite .",
    "fig.[ccd ] shows the @xmath12 and @xmath8 colour - colour diagrams for the sample of pms stars in ngc6611 .",
    "the full lines are the main - sequence and giant loci ; the dashed lines are the reddening band @xcite .",
    "we assume that the spectral type of our lowest - mass object is m3 ( to place the reddening band ) .",
    "we corrected the observed pms colours for the cluster s average extinction .",
    "objects to the right of the reddening band can not have purely photospheric colours and are identified as having a @xmath18 and/or @xmath13 excess , and therefore a circumstellar disc . simply by counting such objects in fig.[ccd ]",
    "we see that 45 out of 259 objects ( 17% ) have an ( @xmath19 ) excess and 135 out of 259 objects ( 52% ) have a ( @xmath20 ) excess .    correcting for 5% contamination from field stars ( that would not show an excess )",
    ", we estimate that 18%@xmath23% and 55%@xmath25% of the pms objects in ngc6611 have ( @xmath19 ) and ( @xmath20 ) excesses respectively .",
    "if we divide the pms objects in two mass bins , 0.45m@xmath3@xmath4m@xmath42m@xmath3 and 2m@xmath3@xmath4m@xmath47m@xmath3 , the ( @xmath20 ) disc frequencies are respectively 58%@xmath25% and 30%@xmath210% , i.e. the disc frequency is lower for more massive stars as it is observed in other star forming regions @xcite .",
    "we are being conservative in our choice of the latest spectral type in the sample .",
    "furthermore , this method tends to underestimate the fraction of early spectral type objects with excesses .",
    "thus , our derived ( @xmath20 ) disc fraction is a lower limit to the true disc frequency for solar - mass stars in ngc6611 .",
    ".comparison of the disc frequency of ngc6611 with similarly aged clusters . for each cluster the age , spectral type of the most massive star , @xmath21 disc frequency , mass range and number of stars for the determinations are given . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,<,>,^ \" , ]     [ t1 ]    in table[t1 ] we compare the derived disc frequency with published data for nearby star forming regions of a similar age , but where the pms stars are subject to less ionising radiation from the massive stars .",
    "disc frequencies for ic348 and ngc2264 are respectively from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we should point out that these disc frequencies were determined in the same way as in this letter . without taking into account the uncertainties in determining young cluster ages , the disc frequency for ngc6611",
    "is perfectly bracketed by the disc frequencies of these two clusters .",
    "furthermore , the ( @xmath19 ) disc fraction in ngc6611 is also consistent with the ( @xmath19 ) disc fraction in ic348 ( 21%@xmath25% , @xcite ) , indicating that the fractions of _ accretion discs _ might also be similar .",
    "ngc6611 is a young , massive cluster that ionises the eagle nebula . using optical photometry",
    "we have discovered a rich low - mass , pre - main - sequence population in the cluster .",
    "using @xmath8 photometry we investigate the cluster disc frequency for solar - mass objects ( 0.45m@xmath3@xmath4m@xmath42m@xmath3 ) .",
    "the contamination corrected disc frequency is 58%@xmath25% determined from ( @xmath20 ) excesses .",
    "not only is the ( @xmath20 ) disc frequency perfectly comparable with the disc frequencies in ic348 and ngc2264 ( two similarly aged but quieter star forming regions ) , but also the accretion disc frequencies are similar .",
    "this seems to indicate that , despite of the presence of more ( and more luminous ) o - stars in ngc6611 , disc dissipation progresses at a rate indistinguishable from other environments .",
    "we can not say that the ionising flux from the o - stars has no effect on the evolution of circumstellar discs , as an l@xmath1-band excess indicates the presence of a circumstellar dust disc but it does not probe the outer , cooler disc regions and thus it is practically insensitive to total disc mass @xcite .",
    "neither does it reflect other important disc evolution processes like dust grain agglomeration and annealing .",
    "still we find no evidence that the harsher environment of ngc6611 significantly _ hastens _ the dissipation of circumstellar discs around solar - mass stars , when averaged over an entire cluster .",
