    "traditionally , the global properties of elliptical galaxies have been characterized by three observables : the central velocity dispersion @xmath8 , the effective or half - light radius @xmath9 , and the mean surface brightness within the effective radius @xmath10 .",
    "it is generally assumed that elliptical galaxies are relaxed particle systems . from a theoretical point of view",
    ", the virial theorem then predicts a relationship between the gravitational mass , the velocity dispersion and the radius .",
    "this can be written as a relationship between @xmath10 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "these observables should then be constrained to a two - dimensional plane in the above three - space .",
    "elliptical galaxies are indeed found to lie along a plane ; however , the observed plane ( popularly known as the fundamental plane [ fp ] ; djorgovski & davis 1987 , faber et al .",
    "1987 , dressler et al .",
    "1987 ) deviates from the prediction using a constant @xmath11 .",
    "this deviation is known as the `` tilt '' of the fp . since",
    "the above prediction is based on the assumption that the mass  to  light ratio and the global structure of the elliptical galaxies are not dependent on the luminosity , the explanations for the tilt have been attributed to deviations from one or both of these hypotheses .    following on that , faber et al .",
    "( 1987 ) suggested that the @xmath11 values increase systematically with increasing luminosity . using this interpretation , the observed averaged value of the fp tilt over a large group of galaxy samples in the b  band is written as @xmath12 , with @xmath13=0.27@xmath60.08 ( prugniel & simien 1996 ) . since brighter ellipticals are systematically redder ,",
    "at least part of the tilt must be understood as stellar population variations along the different luminosities of elliptical galaxies .",
    "however , the presence of a `` remaining '' tilt ( @xmath13=0.17@xmath60.01 ) in the k  band fp ( pahre , djorgovski & de carvalho 1998 ) , where population variations are weak , implies that this solution alone can not explain completely the observed slope .",
    "in fact , the variation in the properties of the stellar population as deduced from broad band colors and the mg@xmath14 index explain only one - third of the slope , i.e. , @xmath15 in the b - band ( tinsley 1978 , dressler et al .",
    "1987 , prugniel & simien 1996 ) .",
    "we show this more explicitly in figure 1a , where the luminosity dependence of estimated stellar m / l ratios in @xmath16 ( open circles ) and @xmath17-bands ( filled circles ) is plotted for a sample of 911 morphologically selected early - type galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) early data release and the two mass all sky surveys ( 2mass ) ( bell et al .",
    "the dependence of stellar m / l ratios on galaxy luminosity is weak in the @xmath16-band , in line with previous studies , and is negligible in the @xmath17-band .",
    "taken together , the above is consistent with the conclusion that the dominant part of the tilt of the fp ( @xmath18 ) is not a population effect .",
    "changes in the mixture of dark - to - visible matter as function of luminosity would be a plausible explanation for the remaining tilt .",
    "however , observations ( romanowsky et al . 2003 ) demonstrate that the amount of dark matter within an effective radius is in general negligibly small .",
    "furthermore , systematic variations in kinematical structure ( van der marel 1991 , bender , burstein and faber 1992 , hereafter bbf ) and radial anisotropy ( ciotti , lanzoni & renzini 1996 , ciotti & lanzoni 1997 ) can not produce the observed tilt .",
    "the role played by rotation is also small ( busarello et al . 1997 ) .    in this letter",
    ", we argue that the remaining tilt of the fp is due to a systematic variation of the structural ( and its associated dynamical ) nonhomology of the elliptical galaxies as function of their luminosity . following an analogy with",
    "the fp of the globular clusters , djorgovski ( 1995 ) suggested a systematic change in the galaxy concentration as a viable hypothesis .",
    "hjorth & madsen ( 1995 ) explained part of the tilt of the fp ( @xmath19 ) using a galaxy model with a variable central gravitational potential correlated with the luminosity . following a similar idea but using a model directly related with the observations ( the srsic ( 1968 ) r@xmath20 law ) , ciotti et al .",
    "( 1996 ) suggested that a suitable variation ( by a factor of @xmath21 24 ) of the shape parameter @xmath22 ( i.e. a different degree of concentration ) along the fp would be able to explain the tilt . however , prugniel & simien ( 1997 ) ( and see also graham & colless ( 1997 ) in the v  band ) showed that the structural nonhomology contributes only @xmath23 and to fully account for the tilt of the fp they needed to include some contributions from stellar population and rotational support",
    ". these analysis could be affected by a limited sample which had a small range in srsic indices 2@xmath24n@xmath245 which is far from providing the full range of nonhomology observed by other authors with 1@xmath24n@xmath2410 in the same absolute magnitude range -22@xmath24m@xmath5@xmath24 - 15 ( see e.g. , graham & guzmn 2003 )",
    ".    taking into account the full range of structural nonhomology observed , we quantify the contribution to the tilt from the structural nonhomology in the b band .",
    "we show that the structural nonhomology is able to explain @xmath253/4 of the tilt in the b  band ( i.e.  @xmath26=0.2 ) , which , in combination with the tilt expected from population variations ( i.e.@xmath26@xmath210.1 ) can explain completely the observed tilt of the fp .",
    "we use the identity @xmath27 and the scalar virial theorem for a stationary stellar system @xmath28 with @xmath29 being the luminosity , @xmath30 the gravitational constant , @xmath31 the mass and @xmath32 and @xmath33 structure terms . any stellar system in virial equilibrium",
    "is then expected to follow the identity : @xmath34 with the definition given in the introduction for @xmath10 , @xmath35 .",
    "the fp ( dressler et al . 1987 ; djorgovski & davis 1987 ) in the b  band can be fitted by : @xmath36 this relation is a consequence of the variation of @xmath37 with @xmath29.=@xmath38 , @xmath39 has been found to be compatible with 0 ( @xmath40 ; prugniel & simien 1996 ) and in what follows we will assume @xmath41 . ] if , following faber et al .",
    "( 1987 ) , @xmath33 is constant elliptical galaxies would be structurally homologous systems and the tilt would have to be explained as a systematic variation of mass  to  light ( m / l ) ratio with luminosity : @xmath12 , with @xmath13=0.27@xmath60.08 .    as discussed in the introduction it is unlikely that this tilt can be explained by stellar population effects alone .",
    "one needs to combine two well known observations : the systematic variation of stellar populations with luminosity and the change of observed structural properties along the early - type sequence from dwarf to giant ellipticals .",
    "ideally both effects in combination would be able to account for the full tilt of the fp .",
    "it has been shown ( see e.g. trujillo , graham & caon 2001 and references therein ) that elliptical galaxies do not form a homologous structural family and that the luminosity  dependent departures from the r@xmath42 law can be described by the r@xmath20 srsic model .",
    "the nonhomology is also reflected in the strong correlations between the shape parameter @xmath22 and photometric  independent galaxy properties as , for example , the central velocity dispersion ( graham , trujillo & caon , 2001 ) .    in fig .",
    "[ nohomo]b , we show the relation between the shape index @xmath22 and the absolute b  band ( model  independent ) magnitude for 200 elliptical galaxies .",
    "the galaxies used in this plot correspond to ellipticals from the virgo , fornax and coma clusters ( caon et al .",
    "1990 ; caon , capaccioli & donofrio 1994 ; binggeli & jerjen 1998 ; gutirrez et al .",
    "those galaxies classified as s0 were removed from our sample to avoid possible missmeasurements of the index @xmath22 due to the disk component of these galaxies .",
    "error estimates for @xmath22 are found to have a typical uncertainty of 25% ( caon , capaccioli & donofrio 1993 ) .",
    "the high statistical significance of this correlation has been studied in previous papers ( see , e.g. graham et al . 2001 ) . to check that the robustness of the above relation is not affected by the large number of faint galaxies , we have evaluated the spearman correlation coefficient for those galaxies brighter than m@xmath5=-16.5 ( h@xmath43=70 km s@xmath44 mpc@xmath44 ) and we find r@xmath45=0.72 .    using the srsic model , it is possible to relate the structural parameter @xmath33 with @xmath22 , leading also to a relation between @xmath22 and @xmath29 , or between @xmath33 and @xmath29 . to estimate @xmath33 for a srsic model we need to evaluate the velocity dispersion profile @xmath46 . in the most simple case",
    "this can be done by assuming a spherical , nonrotating , isotropic r@xmath20 model and then evaluating @xmath46 using the jeans equation ( see , e.g. , binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "however , the observed central velocity dispersion @xmath8 that enters in eq . [ cdos ] does not correspond to @xmath47 , but rather to the observed projected velocity dispersion @xmath48 , luminosity averaged over the aperture used for the spectrographic observations @xmath49 .",
    "consequently , to evaluate properly @xmath33 , we need to switch from @xmath46 to @xmath48 and from this to @xmath49 ( see a detailed explanation e.g. in sec .",
    "2.2 of ciotti et al .",
    "1996 ) .    to illustrate how @xmath33 changes depending on which estimate of the velocity dispersion is used we show in fig .",
    "[ cdosplot ] the relation between @xmath33 and @xmath22 derived from @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "we show @xmath33 for @xmath53 because this is one of the most usual aperture radii to measure @xmath8 ( jrgensen , franx & kjrgaard 1993 ) .",
    "our value of @xmath33 is in good agreement with the estimates of this quantity by other authors ( e.g. prugniel & simien ( 1997 ) , bertin , ciotti & del principe , 2002 ) .    since the sizes of galaxies differ from one another and because galaxies are observed at different distances , the estimation of the central velocity dispersion using a fixed angular aperture samples different fractions of the total light ( or the effective radii ) .",
    "consequently , when dealing with samples that extend over a large range of sizes , it is not the best approximation to estimate @xmath33 from the observations by using a fixed aperture related to the effective radius ( e.g. @xmath9/8 )",
    ". instead one should use typical angular apertures ( e.g. 1.@xmath546 or 2.@xmath542 ) .    in order to evaluate the influence of nonhomology in the fp , we have selected from the sample of elliptical galaxies presented above those galaxies that have a measured central velocity dispersion .",
    "the velocity dispersions are obtained from hypercat .",
    "this leaves us with a total of 45 galaxies ranging from -15 to -22 in the b  band . in fig .",
    "[ cdosplot ] we show the @xmath33 values for the galaxies of this subsample estimated using two different fixed realistic apertures 1.@xmath546 and 2.@xmath542 . as we can see in this figure , the effect of changing the aperture from 1.@xmath546 to 2.@xmath542 is not dramatic . in what follows we will use the mean value of these two measurements @xmath55 and @xmath56 as an estimate of the true value of @xmath33 for our observed galaxies .",
    "fig . [ tilt ] shows the relation between @xmath11 and the luminosity @xmath29 for the selected galaxies , taking into account the variation in @xmath33 as a result of variations in shape parameters @xmath22 . for comparison , in the same figure",
    "we also show the result for a constant value for c@xmath14 , i.e. if structural homology is assumed to hold .",
    "the value we have used for c@xmath14=4.86 in the assumption of homology is taken to match the value presented in bbf for a king model with @xmath57100 .",
    "this value is quite close to the value expected for a de vaucouleurs law ( n=4 ; c@xmath14=4.6 ) .",
    "[ tilt ] shows that the relationship between the @xmath11 and @xmath29 is much flatter if the nonhomology is accounted for . to quantify this change",
    "we have performed a minimum @xmath58 fit to the data distributions using the relation @xmath59 .",
    "the values are @xmath60 if nonhomology is addressed and @xmath61 for the homologous case .",
    "the exponent @xmath13 for the homologous case in the b - band is in excellent agreement with the values reported previously . on the other hand",
    ", we can see that the nonhomology part of the tilt accounts for @xmath62 .",
    "we have also checked if the incompleteness is playing a role at the fainter luminosities .",
    "our sample is 90% complete down m@xmath5=-17 .",
    "if we remove from our analysis all the galaxies below this limit we get the following exponents : @xmath63 for the homologous case and @xmath64 in the nonhomologous case .",
    "again , we find that the nonhomology part of the tilt accounts for @xmath62 .",
    "it is encouraging that the tilt @xmath65 of the fp after correction for to nonhomology is in very good agreement with the value expected due to systematic variations of stellar population properties of elliptical galaxies ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "the observed tilt of @xmath61 in the b  band fp therefore can be understood as a combination of three - quarters structural nonhomology and one - quarter stellar population effects .",
    "the tilt of the k  band fp where the change in the stellar population is negligible is approximately @xmath67 .",
    "this is indeed in good agreement with our expectation if the tilt were due only to the nonhomology and if color gradients inside galaxies do not change their srsic indices . indeed ,",
    "k gradients in the surface brightness profiles of ellipticals are on average only 0.16 mag dex@xmath44 ( peletier , valentijn & jameson 1990 ) which is small compared to the variations in surface brightness within an effective radius .",
    "the homologous fp of our sample has a scatter in log(m / l ) of order 25% which is consistent with previous results ( bbf ; pahre , djorgovski & carvalho 1998 ) .",
    "the scatter is not significantly reduced in the non - homologous fp which indicates that it is mainly a result of population effects and not of structural variations within a given luminosity bin .",
    "our results rule out that even very massive ellipticals are strongly dominated by dark matter in their inner regions , which is in agreement with rix et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and gerhard et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . after correcting for nonhomology",
    ", the mean value of the mass - to - light ratio ( m / l@xmath5 ) of early - type galaxies in our luminosity range is 7.1@xmath62.8 ( 1@xmath7 scatter ) .",
