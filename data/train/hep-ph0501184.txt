    "the current status of neutrino oscillation parameter estimations can be very briefly summarized  @xcite as follows : atmospheric ( solar ) neutrinos oscillate with @xmath1 ev@xmath2 and @xmath3  @xcite ( @xmath4 ev@xmath2 , @xmath5  @xcite ) ( @xmath6 ) is the solar ( atmospheric ) mass - squared difference and @xmath7 , @xmath0 and @xmath8 are the mixing angles conventionally denoted by @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively  @xcite . ] .",
    "all we presently know about @xmath0 is that @xmath12 at the 2@xmath13 c.  l.  @xcite .",
    "a long - standing hope is that neutrinos from a core - collapse supernova ( sn ) may shed light on two of the unknown oscillation parameters , sgn(@xmath6 ) and @xmath0 .",
    "only a handful of neutrinos from a type ii sn have ever been detected .",
    "the detection of 11 neutrinos from sn 1987a in kamiokande ii  @xcite and 8 neutrinos in the irvine michigan brookhaven experiment  @xcite have been of great importance for understanding core - collapse  @xcite .",
    "it is evident that the physics potential offered by a future galactic sn event is immense .",
    "with cognizance of this potential , experiments dedicated to sn neutrino detection have been proposed  @xcite even though only a few galactic sn are expected per century .",
    "attempts have been made to extract neutrino oscillation parameters from the 19 sn 1987a events .",
    "however , conclusions drawn from such analyses are highly dependent on the neutrino flux model adopted and are far from robust . for example ( and within the context of this paper )",
    ", it was claimed that the data favor the normal hierarchy ( @xmath14 ) over the inverted hierarchy ( @xmath15 ) provided @xmath16  @xcite , but this conclusion was contradicted in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "neutrinos from a galactic sn could in principle provide a wealth of information on neutrino oscillations .",
    "a determination of @xmath17 and the neutrino mass hierarchy from sn neutrinos is unique in that ambiguities  @xcite arising from the unknown @xmath18 phase @xmath19 and the deviation of atmospheric neutrino mixing from maximality do not corrupt it .",
    "the absence of the eight - fold parameter degeneracies that are inherent in long baseline experiments  @xcite results because ( i ) nonelectron neutrino fluxes and @xmath20 interactions , which can not distinguish between the different nonelectron neutrino species ( that we denote by @xmath21 with @xmath22 ) . ] do not depend on @xmath19 independently of neutrino conversion  @xcite , and so sn neutrinos directly probe @xmath17 , and ( ii ) whether atmospheric mixing is maximal or not is immaterial since @xmath8 does not affect the oscillation dynamics .",
    "investigations of the effect of neutrino oscillations on sn neutrinos in the context of a static density profile ( _ i.e. , _ neglecting shock effects ) have been made in refs .",
    "@xcite . whether or not the mass hierarchy can be determined and @xmath0 be constrained depends sensitively on the strength of the hierarchy between @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the higher @xmath25 is above unity , the better the possible determinations  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , modern sn models that include all relevant neutrino interaction effects like nuclear recoil and nucleon bremsstrahlung indicate that the hierarchy of average energies is likely smaller than expected from traditional predictions ; @xmath25 is expected to be about 1.1 , and no larger than 1.2  @xcite as opposed to ratios above 1.5 from older sn codes  @xcite .",
    "another relevant uncertainty is that different sn models predict different degrees to which equipartitioning of energy between @xmath26 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 is violated .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite an almost perfect equipartitioning is obtained while according to refs .",
    "@xcite , equipartitioning holds only to within a factor of 2 .",
    "given these uncertainties , it is not a simple task to determine @xmath0 and the mass hierarchy simultaneously from sn data  @xcite . a significant improvement would be a determination of the mass hierarchy independently of predictions for @xmath25 and equipartitioning from sn models . in this paper",
    "we propose a new method using sn neutrinos to determine the mass hierarchy that exploits recent advances in the understanding of shock propagation in sn .    at densities",
    "@xmath27 g/@xmath28 , neutrino oscillations are governed by @xmath29 and @xmath30  @xcite .",
    "neutrinos ( antineutrinos ) pass through a resonance if @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) . as the shock traverses the resonance , adiabaticity",
    "is severely affected causing oscillations to be temporarily suppressed , as first pointed out in ref .  @xcite .",
    "after the shock moves beyond the resonance , oscillations are restored .",
    "then one expects a dip in the time evolution of the average neutrino energy and the number of events .",
    "this modulation is visible in the neutrino ( antineutrino ) channel for a normal ( inverted ) mass hierarchy and only if @xmath33 _",
    "i.e. _ , only for oscillations that would occur adiabatically for a static density profile .",
    "previous work exploiting the dip to obtain information about oscillation parameters can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    within the first 4 seconds or so ,",
    "the violation of adiabaticity caused by the shock is felt only by neutrinos with energy less than about 20 mev . at these energies",
    "some models predict the @xmath21 flux to be larger than the @xmath26 and @xmath20 fluxes  @xcite and others predict the converse  @xcite . at later times",
    ", the shock affects higher energy neutrinos for which all models predict the @xmath21 flux to be dominant .",
    "the dip is observable even for @xmath34 because the fluxes are flavor - dependent  @xcite .",
    "thus , a signature in high energy neutrinos a few seconds after bounce is quite model - independent . through our analysis",
    "we show that the signal is so robust that a restriction to high - energy events is unnecessary .",
    "we investigate the significance with which the mass hierarchy can be determined by measurement of the @xmath26 spectrum at a 100 kton liquid argon detector and the @xmath20 spectrum at a 1 mton water cherenkov detector from a galactic sn at a distance of 10 kpc with binding energy @xmath35 ergs .",
    "the number of unoscillated events in the liquid ar ( water cherenkov ) detector is expected to be @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) . (",
    "although a liquid argon detector can measure both the @xmath26 and @xmath20 spectra , it is an order of magnitude more sensitive to the @xmath26 flux than to the @xmath20 flux  @xcite ) .",
    "we are interested in the detectability of a dip in the time evolution of either the @xmath26 or the @xmath20 spectrum , but not both . by correlating the two spectra",
    ", it should be possible to establish the mass hierarchy and that @xmath33 .",
    "the presence of a dip will also provide further evidence that sn simulations correctly depict shock propagation .",
    "if a dip is not found in either channel , it would suggest that @xmath38 , since the salient features of the theory of core - collapse sn have already received strong support from sn 1987a  @xcite .",
    "realistic time - dependent density profiles of sn are obtained from detailed numerical siumulations . as one moves in towards the neutron star , the profile at a given instant",
    "has a sharp density rise followed by a rarefaction region where the density can drop significantly below that at the outer edge of the shock .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite have provided a generic time - dependent density profile that mimics those of supernova simulations .",
    "the shock front is steepened artificially to reintroduce the physical requirement of a density discontinuity which is lost in hydrodynamic simulations due to the limited ( few 100 km ) spatial resolution .",
    "we adopt the empirical parameterization of this profile ( which is continuous in the supernova radius and time ) developed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "because of the dip in density in the rarefaction region , neutrinos may hop between mass eigenstates up to 3 times before leaving the sn envelope . under the assumptions that the transitions factorize and",
    "the neutrino phases can be averaged away , a simple analytic expression for the overall hopping probability @xmath39 was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , which agrees remarkably well with phase - averaged results of runge - kutta evolution of the neutrino flavor propagation equations .",
    "we employ the analytic expression for @xmath40 to calculate the @xmath26 and @xmath41 survival probabilities .",
    "these survival probabilities do not depend on @xmath42 since we are neglecting earth matter effects  @xcite : @xmath43 here , the @xmath44 and @xmath45 subscripts denote normal and inverted hierarchy , respectively .",
    "we note that the factorization of the 3-neutrino dynamics into two 2-neutrino subsystems continues to hold with the subsystem governed by @xmath42 and @xmath7 remaining adiabatic ( for the now well - established large mixing angle solution  @xcite ) as in the case of a static density profile  @xcite .",
    "we use the parameterization of ref .",
    "@xcite for the primary unoscillated neutrino spectra given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 , @xmath41 , @xmath21 , and @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) is the average energy ( dimensionless shape parameter that quantifies the width of the spectrum ) of species @xmath50 . in principle , both @xmath48 and @xmath49 can be time - dependent . throughout ,",
    "we assume @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53  @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath54 is the neutrino emission rate or luminosity of species @xmath50 .",
    "the only available simulation that tracks neutrino emission for times long enough to enable studies of shock effects on neutrino oscillations is that of the livermore group .",
    "we adopt the luminosities of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "our goal is to demonstrate the model - independence of our new method . to this end",
    ", we consider models that span a wide range of predictions for the energy spectra .",
    "we conservatively consider the following parameter ranges for the initial spectra ( indicated by the `` 0 '' superscript ) in our analyses ( with all energies in mev ) : @xmath55 @xmath56 this is in line with the hierarchy of average energies @xmath57 , expected from the well - known interaction strengths of neutrinos with matter ; the species which interacts less decouples earlier and has a higher temperature .",
    "we will occasionally refer to a specific model which appears to be quite pessimistic for determining oscillation parameters because the different neutrino species have very small spectral differences .",
    "it is a model obtained by the garching group by accounting for all relevant neutrino interaction effects .",
    "the initial spectra predicted by the garching model have  @xcite @xmath58",
    "for the 1 mton hyper - kamiokande detector  @xcite we assume an energy threshold of 7 mev and a fiducial volume for sn neutrinos of 685 kton which is consistent with the fiducial to total volume ratio expected for the uno detector  @xcite .",
    "we only consider events from inverse @xmath59-decay and use the higher - order cross section of ref .",
    "we assume that the energy resolution is that of the super - kamiokande detector  @xcite .    for the 100 kton liquid ar detector  @xcite with near - perfect efficiency , we consider the absorption process , @xmath60 , whose cross section is calculated in ref .",
    "the effective threshold is 6 mev .",
    "since the energy resolution is expected to be extremely good , we do not include resolution effects .    for each mass hierarchy and several values of @xmath0 , we randomly choose sn models defined by the parameter ranges of eqs .",
    "( [ energyranges],[lumranges ] ) and simulate @xmath61 possible @xmath26 and @xmath41 spectra at the two detectors ( including statistical fluctuations ) .",
    "we fix @xmath62  @xcite and @xmath63 ev@xmath2  @xcite .",
    "we ignore earth matter effects ( thereby not committing ourselves to specific zenith angles for the sn ) which only become comparable to shock effects at very small @xmath0 .",
    "we illustrate the effect of the shock on the neutrino spectra in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] .",
    "( solid green curves ) and @xmath41 spectra ( dashed red curves ) for the normal hierarchy and inverted hierarchy , respectively with @xmath64 . the thick ( thin ) lines correspond to @xmath65 ( @xmath48 that fall linearly 5 secs after the core - bounce ) .",
    "the curves are based on the ( pessimistic ) garching model of eq.([garching ] ) .",
    "note the pronounced dips in the @xmath26 ( @xmath41 ) spectra for the normal ( inverted ) hierarchy .",
    "[ fig : spectra],width=576 ]",
    "we consider two cases ( a ) @xmath65 and ( b ) with @xmath48 falling linearly with time 5 secs post - bounce according to @xmath66 .",
    "we have chosen this parametrization to agree with that in ref .  @xcite .",
    "although this fall - off in energy with time is arbitrary , it serves to demonstrate the robustness of our analysis to specific assumptions about @xmath67 .",
    "after all , in a real sn , nature will make a unique selection for @xmath67 which is as yet unknown to us .",
    "so long as @xmath68 , we expect a dip in the @xmath26 ( @xmath41 ) spectrum if the hierarchy is normal ( inverted ) as in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] . a way to establish the channel in which the dip occurs exploits the fact that the dip is expected to occur 4 seconds after the shock forms ( _ i.e. _ after the core rebounds ) .",
    "we split each spectrum into 2 time bins .",
    "all the events occuring in the first 4 seconds constitute the `` early time bin '' , with mean energy @xmath69 and the events occuring between 4 and 10 seconds constitute the `` late time bin '' , with mean energy @xmath70 .",
    "their ratio is @xmath71 in the case that @xmath65 , for the normal hierarchy we expect @xmath72 to be smaller than unity and @xmath73 to be close to unity and vice - versa for the inverted hierarchy . if @xmath74 , we expect both ratios to be close to unity .    for falling @xmath48 ,",
    "we expect both @xmath72 and @xmath73 to be slightly below unity even if @xmath74 .",
    "this is because @xmath48 starts falling 5 seconds after bounce , which lowers @xmath75 relative to @xmath69 .",
    "this shock - independent suppression can not be large since even at @xmath76 secs , @xmath77 .",
    "( clearly the size of the effect depends on how fast @xmath48 falls ) .",
    "then , the hierarchy is deduced by comparing the relative deviations of @xmath78 from unity . if @xmath79 , the hierarchy is inverted . if @xmath80 , the hierarchy is normal .    in fig .",

    "the blue dots are for @xmath81 .",
    "there is little overlap between the clusters , and the inverted hierarchy can be established at more than 3@xmath13 . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : rat]b , the case in which @xmath48 fall linearly also yields little overlap between the clusters , although the clusters are now systematically displaced to lower values of @xmath72 and @xmath73 .     vs. @xmath73 for sn models spanned by eqs .",
    "( [ energyranges],[lumranges ] ) and @xmath64 assuming @xmath65 .",
    "@xmath78 is the ratio of the mean energy of the events occuring between 4 and 10 seconds to the mean energy of the events occuring in the first 4 seconds .",
    "the red squares ( green triangles ) correspond to the normal ( inverted ) hierarchy .",
    "the blue dots are for @xmath81 .",
    "each contour contains 95% of the @xmath82 @xmath26 and @xmath41 spectra generated for the corresponding case .",
    "we have plotted only @xmath83 triangles , squares and dots so as to not overwhelm the figure .",
    "( b ) is the analog of ( a ) but for the case in which @xmath48 falls linearly with time 5 secs after bounce .",
    "the separation of the clusters is a measure of the significance with which the hierarchy can be determined .",
    "[ fig : rat],width=576 ]    we now focus on the @xmath65 case .",
    "it is no surprise that it is more difficult to identify the normal hierarchy considering the lower statistics in the ar detector .",
    "however , it is possible to establish the normal hierarchy reasonably well . in fig .",
    "[ fig : sig]a the dashed red curve shows the fraction of spectra corresponding to the normal hierarchy and @xmath64 with @xmath72 below a given value .",
    "for example , 88% ( 98.7% ) of the spectra corresponding to the normal hierarchy and @xmath64 have @xmath84 ( 0.99 ) .",
    "the solid blue curve shows the number of spectra with @xmath81 and @xmath72 below a given value divided by the number for the normal hierarchy and @xmath64 with @xmath72 below the same value .",
    "thus from fig .  [ fig : sig]a , the fraction of spectra with @xmath81 that mimic the spectra involving shocks , and have @xmath84 ( 0.99 ) , is 0.33% ( 7.6% ) . said differently , 88% ( 98.7% ) of the spectra indicate the normal hierarchy correctly with a probability of 99.67% ( 92.4% ) .",
    "we emphasize that these results have included the garching model of eq .",
    "( [ garching ] ) .",
    "as expected , the results of a similar analysis of @xmath85 spectra simulated from the garching model alone are somewhat worse .",
    "specifically , we find that 87% ( 99% ) of the spectra simulated with the normal hierarchy and @xmath86 have @xmath84 ( 0.99 ) , and identify the normal hierarchy with a confidence of 99% ( 87% ) .",
    "it is remarkable that even for initial spectra with tiny differences , such as in the garching model , it is possible to establish the normal hierarchy .",
    "figure  [ fig : sig]b is similar to  [ fig : sig]a , but for the inverted hierarchy .",
    "clearly , a determination of the inverted hierarchy is easier .",
    "we see that 99.5% of the spectra simulated with an inverted hierarchy and @xmath86 have @xmath87 , and indicate the inverted hierarchy at the 99.99% c.  l.    the case in which @xmath48 fall linearly with time 5 seconds after bounce gives similar results as those for the constant @xmath48 case .",
    "we have also investigated if the hierarchy can be determined for @xmath88 .",
    "it is still possible to establish the the inverted hierarchy with high - confidence . for the normal hierarchy",
    "we find that while shock effects remain visible , it is no longer possible to establish the normal hierarchy with high - significance .",
    "our analysis has established that detections of shock modulations in either the @xmath26 spectrum in a kton - class liquid ar detector or in the @xmath41 spectrum in a mton - class water cherenkov detector will provide definitive evidence for the true neutrino mass hierarchy and that @xmath68 . we emphasize that the modulations should be observed in one and only one of the two channels .",
    "a similar analysis can be performed supposing that a reverse shock also develops in the sn envelope  @xcite .",
    "then , one expects to see a double - dip signature in either the @xmath26 or @xmath41 spectrum if @xmath0 is not too small  @xcite .",
    "in addition to probing oscillation parameters , a presence of a double dip will provide confirmation that sn simulations correctly depict shock propagation .",
    "we have supposed that both a large water cherenkov and large liquid argon detector are available . a possible alternative to a large water cherenkov detector",
    "is the icecube detector since good energy resolution is not a requirement of our analysis .",
    "then @xmath89 can be compared with @xmath72  @xcite .",
    "an aspect that bears further consideration is whether our analysis is robust under variations of the shock density profile .",

    "<S> we demonstrate that the detection of shock modulations of the neutrino spectra from a galactic core - collapse supernova is sufficient to obtain a high significance determination of the neutrino mass hierarchy if the supernova event is observed in both a mton - class water cherenkov detector and a 100 kton - class liquid argon detector . </S>",
