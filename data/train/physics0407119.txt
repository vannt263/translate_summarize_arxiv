    "polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pah s ) have been proposed as the carriers of a family of interstellar aromatic infrared bands ( aib s ) , observed in many astronomical objects.@xcite the most intense of these bands , found near 3030 , 1610 , 13151282 , 1150 and 885 @xmath4 respectively , are observed systematically from different regions of the interstellar medium heated by starlight .",
    "the intensity of these features suggests that pah s are the most abundant complex polyatomic molecules in the interstellar medium , accounting perhaps for as much as 20@xmath5 of all carbon in our galaxy.@xcite many laboratory studies and quantum chemical calculations or models@xcite of single pah molecules have been performed in the past , but none has yet provided convincing evidence that single pah molecules are actually present in the interstellar medium .",
    "this result is likely due to the specific nature of the interstellar species , in relation to their formation mechanism and further processes such as photodissociation .",
    "et al._@xcite and bernard _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite suggested that the observed free - flying pah s are produced by photoevaporation of larger grains .",
    "et al._@xcite attributed the presence of an infrared continuum observed in the reflection nebula ced 201 to very small carbonaceous grains eventually leading to the aib s carriers . in recent work , rapacioli _",
    "et al._@xcite presented strong evidence that these grains are pah clusters , and a typical lower size of 400 carbons per cluster was inferred .    generally speaking , very little is known about the structure of pah clusters . in comparison , assemblies of benzene molecules have received much more attention . at empirical levels of theory ,",
    "van de waal@xcite and the groups of stace,@xcite bartell@xcite and whetten and easter@xcite have investigated assemblies containing up to 13 benzene molecules .",
    "these studies showed a marked preference for the wefelmeier growth scheme@xcite also observed in argon clusters.@xcite the ( benzene)@xmath6 cluster , in particular , was shown to exhibit very stable icosahedral - based structures,@xcite some of which have received experimental support . at more sophisticated levels ,",
    "electronic structure calculations have also been performed by several authors.@xcite the cationic species ( c@xmath7h@xmath7)@xmath8 have been investigated experimentally from ion mobility measurements by rusyniak _",
    "et al._@xcite these authors also performed structural optimization using the opls force field.@xcite    naphthalene clusters have been studied by van de waal,@xcite who identified patterns similar to benzene clusters .",
    "more recently , the structure of the naphthalene trimer obtained from experimental studies@xcite was shown to agree well with one derived from _ ab initio _",
    "calculations.@xcite    anthracene clusters containing up to 5 molecules were investigated theoretically and experimentally by piuzzi and coworkers.@xcite despite their relatively small size , these clusters seem to show quite different structures , forming a mainly two - dimensional pattern in which the long axes of the molecules are aligned , their centers of mass lying in the same perpendicular plane . song and coworkers@xcite reported mass spectrometry measurements for anionic clusters containing up to 16 anthracene molecules .",
    "heterogeneous clusters made of one or several benzene molecules and a single naphthalene , anthracene , perylene or tetracene molecule have been studied , sometimes in the presence of a solvent.@xcite data for larger pah molecules is significantly more scarce .",
    "the coronene and circumcoronene dimers were investigated by miller and coworkers.@xcite aggregates of pah molecules were _ assumed _ by seahra and duley @xcite to form stacks .",
    "these authors used data from graphite to estimate some translational vibrational modes of stacked pah s .",
    "however , this assumption did not employ any atomistic modelling .",
    "marzec,@xcite using an extension of the mm2 force field@xcite and semi - empirical quantum mechanical approaches , performed local optimizations of stacked structures containing up to 6 molecules . in this study ,",
    "the stacks were shown to be stable for pah s ranging from dibenzopyrene to dicoronene.@xcite perlstein@xcite investigated the transition from one - dimensional stacks to monolayers and crystal packings of various molecular species , also using the mm2 classical potential .",
    "while bulk polyaromatic compounds are very difficult to study experimentally , nearly pure macroscopic samples of hexabenzocoronene molecules were shown to form a twinned crystal.@xcite crystallization via epitaxial growth over a graphite surface has also been reported.@xcite computer simulations results by khanna and coworkers@xcite indicate that large sets of coronene or circumcoronene molecules do indeed crystallise and melt through a first - order process without exhibiting intermediate liquid crystal behavior .",
    "more generally , the bulk phases of pah molecules can be expected to show similar phase diagrams as the model discotic particles studied by several authors.@xcite    our present interest lies in the size range between the very small and very large sizes , for aggregates containing about 1000 carbon atoms .",
    "we wish to address the following questions :    * are the stacks of pah molecules actually the most stable form for clusters ? * how large can these stacks be as a function of the pah monomer size ?",
    "* how does the cluster structure evolve toward the bulk morphology ?",
    "in addition to these main concerns , we intend to address not only clusters of the same pah molecule , but also some heterogeneous assemblies , as the experimental situation we are referring to does not have restrictions on the variety of pah s involved .",
    "locating the most stable structures of molecular clusters can be quite difficult.@xcite for example , water clusters have been found to exhibit a multi - funnel potential energy surface,@xcite where numerous low energy minima exist , but can only be interconnected by long pathways .",
    "global optimization is significantly harder for rigid body water clusters than for most atomic clusters with a comparable number of degrees of freedom.@xcite pah clusters , which are made of very anisotropic monomers , represent a novel challenge for molecular optimization , somewhere in between the difficulties associated with atomic clusters and those of biological molecules.@xcite    in the present work , we have attempted to locate the stable structures of assemblies of relatively large pah molecules ranging from pyrene to circumcoronene .",
    "we combine results from electronic structure calculations and atomistic modelling to describe the intermolecular interactions , within a rigid body approximation for the pah molecules .",
    "global optimization using the basin - hopping@xcite and parallel tempering@xcite monte carlo methods then provide estimates of the most stable isomers , for clusters containing up to 32 molecules .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we give the basic description of our model , as well as some details about the electronic structure calculations and the optimization procedure .",
    "section [ sec : struct ] presents our results for the structures , starting with the dimers .",
    "a more detailed analysis is provided in the case of coronene clusters , and the relative stability of some important structural motifs is investigated .",
    "[ sec : struct ] ends with some results for heterogeneous clusters . in sec .",
    "[ sec : vib ] we briefly discuss intermolecular vibrational modes .",
    "we comment in section [ sec : disc ] on the difficulties encountered in our global optimization approach and in the robustness of our results with respect to the quality of the atomistic modelling . finally , we summarize and discuss the astrophysical relevance of our results in sec . [",
    "sec : ccl ] .",
    "our goal here is to provide good candidates for the most stable structures of clusters of pah molecules .",
    "these structures are expected to be relevant at very low temperatures , where intramolecular vibrations are unlikely to be excited .",
    "this legitimises our main approximation that the pah molecules can be treated as rigid bodies .",
    "the pah molecules considered are pyrene ( c@xmath9h@xmath0 ) , coronene ( c@xmath10h@xmath11 ) , ovalene ( c@xmath12h@xmath9 ) , hexabenzocoronene ( hbc , c@xmath13h@xmath3 ) , octabenzocoronene ( obc , c@xmath14h@xmath3 ) , and circumcoronene ( c@xmath2h@xmath3 ) .",
    "the cluster sizes range from 2 to 32 depending on the monomer , so we will be dealing with a rather large number of atoms . considering the known difficulty of global optimization,@xcite it seems obvious that the atomistic modelling should be limited to a moderate numerical cost  but retaining the important chemical features .",
    "in particular , the multipolar electrostatic description employed in ref .   is not appropriate for an initial survey , although such ideas could provide useful corrections . following previous efforts on benzene clusters by several groups,@xcite we have chosen to describe the intermolecular potential in pah clusters as the result of two contributions : @xmath15 , \\label{eq : vpot}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 denotes the repulsion - dispersion energy between atom @xmath17 of molecule @xmath18 and @xmath19 of molecule @xmath20 , and @xmath21 the electrostatic interaction between the partial charges carried by the molecules .",
    "here and in the following , the pah molecules are denoted by roman letters , and greek letters are used for the atoms of each molecule .",
    "the lennard - jones ( lj ) form is used for the repulsion - dispersion , with parameters @xmath22 taken from ref .  .",
    "the electrostatic contributions are based on the point charges @xmath23 located on the atom sites .",
    "the molecular geometries and partial charges were initially determined from electronic structure calculations on pah monomers .",
    "the molecular geometries were those determined in tight - binding calculations .",
    "the partial atomic charges were initially determined from electronic structure calculations using the b3lyp hybrid functional and the gaussian03 package.@xcite those calculations were carried out using core pseudopotentials on carbon as determined by durand and barthelat,@xcite and tabulated in semi - local form by bouteiller _",
    "et al._@xcite the gaussian type orbital ( gto ) basis set used was [ 4s/4p/1d ] contracted into [ 31/31/1 ] on the carbon atoms and [ 4s/1p ] contracted into [ 31/1 ] on the hydrogen atoms .",
    "the basis sets are specified fully in table [ tab : basis ] .",
    "in addition to the neutral pah molecules , calculations were also performed on the singly charged anions and cations at the neutral geometry .",
    "these results allow us to investigate the relative stability of zwitterionic species .",
    ".atomic gto basis sets employed for carbon and hydrogen . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     as expected from the strong anisotropy of the molecular interactions , the vibrational modes can generally be gathered into two separate groups , the bending and breathing motions being the stiffest and the shearing and twisting motions the softest .",
    "the frequency of the breathing mode grows quite regularly with increasing pah mass . for the circumcoronene dimer ,",
    "this frequency is quite close to the value generally accepted for graphene layers , namely @xmath24  @xmath4 .",
    "this result indicates that our atomistic modelling is physically correct .",
    "the increase of the frequencies for larger pah s is a natural consequence of the increasing strength of the repulsion - dispersion interactions .",
    "both the repulsive and attractive parts of the potential increase roughly linearly with the surface area of the pah molecules , because they are both short - ranged . at first order ,",
    "the force constant scales approximately linearly with the pah mass , therefore the associated frequency remains constant . however , the attractive part of the potential has a shorter range than its repulsive part , so it increases somewhat faster with the mass .",
    "thus the effective force constant increases slightly more rapidly than linearly with the mass , in agreement with the observed increase in the frequency .",
    "this effect is magnified by the decreasing role of the coulomb forces , which become negligible in the limit of two graphene sheets .",
    "the bending modes generally show similar frequencies to the breathing mode , and also the same pattern .",
    "however , less symmetrical molecules , such as ovalene or obc , have non - degenerate bending modes , resulting in smaller average values . both the twisting and shearing modes are comparatively very soft , reflecting the small corrugation of the molecular planes .",
    "lastly , the vibrations of the zwitterionic form of the coronene dimer , chosen as a typical example , display significantly stiffer modes . in this system ,",
    "the coulomb interactions become dominant at long range , which affects the shearing , and especially the twisting modes .",
    "larger assemblies of pah molecules show a greater variety of modes .",
    "stack vibrations have been considered by seahra and duley@xcite in the one - dimensional approximation of longitudinal modes only .",
    "however , the results obtained in the previous section show that multiple - stack conformations should become more stable as more and more pah molecules are added .",
    "this result calls for a more complete study of vibrational properties , including the possible influence of intramolecular motion .",
    "in the original basin - hopping global minimization approach followed here , all molecules are translated and rotated simultaneously from their original position before a new local optimization is carried out .",
    "subsequent moves are then performed starting from the current local minimum in a markov chain .",
    "this approach was not very efficient for large pah assemblies and/or extended individual molecules due to the frequent intersections induced by the large amplitude motions .",
    "the parallel tempering strategy , which employs smaller physical moves , avoids such problems but can be quite slow in converging toward low energies .",
    "in addition the set of temperatures needs to be adjusted for the configurations to be communicated to the colder trajectories . in practice , we supplemented the parallel tempering mc simulations with periodic quenches at the trajectory corresponding to @xmath25  k. several of the most stable structures were found by seeding the optimizations with a single main stack and adding the required extra molecules randomly in space .",
    "the results obtained in the previous section and the occurrence of small stacks as the main structural motif of larger assemblies suggest several ways for improving the basin - hopping technique in order to deal more efficiently with such anisotropic molecules as pah s :    * randomly select a single molecule ; choose its orientation from among those of the other molecules ; move the molecule randomly in space to a location where it does not suffer any overlap .",
    "* select several molecules stacked together and move then simultaneously as a block , so that they do not overlap with any remaining molecule . *",
    "follow collective , large amplitude motion with a rescaling of all distances , such that the minimum pair distance is at least the pah size ; then choose random orientations for all molecules .",
    "* perform local moves that add or remove a single molecule at the tip of a stack .",
    "the above ideas can be combined into a single monte carlo approach , with appropriate probabilities for each type of move .",
    "they are suited to the specific case of prolate molecules , which pose more significant difficulties in numerical simulations than spherical or oblate species .",
    "such moves obviously constitute a bias to optimization , but they should improve the performance of the algorithm by guiding it toward the multiple - stack funnels .",
    "the choice of the intermolecular potential is crucial in predicting the correct physical and chemical properties of macromolecular assemblies .",
    "this is especially true for smaller molecules , such as benzene , where small changes in the repulsion - dispersion or electrostatic parameters can easily lead to the wrong crystal structure.@xcite    we did not find significant changes in our results on taking the lennard - jones parameters from other sources , such as the opls model of jorgensen and coworkers.@xcite however , the same is not true for the electrostatic multipolar contribution .",
    "the nbo charges obtained from the same dft calculation on the coronene molecule are significantly larger in magnitude than the epf charges , especially on the hydrogens ( table [ tab : charge ] ) .",
    "the corresponding coulomb energy is therefore much larger , and becomes comparable to the dispersion energy .",
    "such charges yield very different global minima , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : coro13 ] for ( coronene)@xmath6 .",
    "the disappearance of the handshake structure , fig .",
    "[ fig : coro13]a , reflects the much longer range character of the intermolecular interaction , which somewhat shields the molecular anisotropy . here",
    "it becomes necessary to clearly distinguish between the anisotropy of the molecules themselves ( the so - called shape anisotropy ) and the effective anisotropy of their intermolecular potential . increasing the magnitude of the coulomb interaction results in a stronger short - range repulsion , which is first manifested in destabilization of the simple stack , either crossed or parallel - displaced , for the coronene dimer . at their new equilibrium distance , the relative orientation between two molecules",
    "is mainly driven by the interaction between quadrupoles . for larger pah molecules",
    ", we expect the partial charges and quadrupole to become less and less important as the carbon frame gets more homogeneous . on the contrary ,",
    "smaller pah s should be even more sensitive to the electrostatic effects .",
    "this is consistent with the equilibrium structures , which favour the t - shaped motif over parallel stacks .",
    "in larger assemblies , isotropic interactions favor an icosahedral growth scheme over stacking . in the structure displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : coro13]b , the molecular centers of mass indeed form a distorted icosahedron , similar to what has been found in ( benzene)@xmath6 by several authors.@xcite such structures are significantly easier to locate than stacked isomers , because the orientational degrees of freedom can be neglected in a first approach . here the third trick suggested in the previous subsection for improving the basin - hopping algorithm should be efficient .",
    "the mulliken charges responsible for the icosahedral minimum are probably much too high and they do not support stable stacks of coronene pah s , which is in disagreement with most previous studies .",
    "conversely , setting the partial charges to zero does not alter the results very much , thus confirming that stacking is mostly induced by the intrinsic molecular anisotropy .",
    "the work reported in this paper was devoted to locating the global minimum for assemblies of large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules . to do this",
    "we first constructed an empirical potential from available data for the repulsion - dispersion part , as well as from some carefully analysed density functional calculations for the electrostatic contribution .",
    "these extra _ ab initio _ calculations were mainly motivated by the lack of published data on the specific interactions between large pah molecules . in an attempt to rationalize the various charge distributions obtained for the neutral and ionic pah s , we adjusted a simple fluctuating charges model based on four parameters .",
    "this model , used for reoptimizing the charges of the pah molecules in the environment of their own stable assemblies , indicates that the fixed partial charges approximation is quantitatively correct , at least close to the equilibrium geometries .    using a combined set of global optimization techniques",
    ", we have shown that clusters of pah molecules grow by forming stacks .",
    "this optimization process turned out to be difficult because of the large amplitude random motions involved .",
    "therefore the putative global minima we have found might be bettered in future work , although we expect the trends to be correct .",
    "we suggested ways of improving optimization algorithms dealing with strong shape anisotropy , which could also be useful for the liquid crystal phases of discotic molecules.@xcite    stack formation appears to be mainly driven by the pah size , since clusters of benzene and , to some extent , naphthalene or anthracene , tend to keep some of the polytetrahedral order known in small atomic clusters.@xcite however , the one - dimensional growth of the stack is quite limited , and more close - packed forms become favored after a certain size , which increases with the pah diameter .",
    "these new forms are based on smaller stacks , and larger clusters are also made of the small stack motif .",
    "eventually , parallel stacks with alternate orientations of the molecular plane appear , as the precursor to the herringbone crystalline arrangement .",
    "we also found that the electronic structure calculations of the partial charges had to be performed carefully , since overestimation of the coulomb energy wrongly leads to more isotropic interactions , which destabilizes the stacks .",
    "the formation and physico - chemical evolution of pah s is a question of great interest in astrochemistry .",
    "recently , rapacioli _",
    "et al._@xcite have revealed the chemical link that exists between pah molecules and small carbonaceous grains .",
    "these authors suggested that the grains might be pah clusters .",
    "the results presented here can provide guidelines to understand the nature and evolution of such systems in astrophysical environments .",
    "we note that all these results are only based upon energetic considerations and that entropic criteria have not been taken into account .",
    "growth could proceed by monomer addition , but also by the addition of small clusters , presumably as short stacks .",
    "therefore , the aggregation kinetics could also play an important role in the structure of the final aggregate .",
    "as we have seen , thermodynamics should favor segregation , since smaller pah s are expected to be located in the outermost parts of the aggregate .",
    "upon addition of one or more extra pah s , the rearrangements required to reach the true global minimum involve very high energy barriers , due to the anisotropy of the molecules and their layered structures . in the interior of molecular clouds the temperature is very low , which might be an argument against the relevance of calculations based on thermodynamics only . however , the large timescales involved in molecular clouds , whose lifetime is close to @xmath2610@xmath27 years , could allow the cluster to explore many configurations , eventually reaching low - lying minima .",
    "another opportunity for rearrangement into these stable configurations comes from heating by uv - visible photons originating from stars at the border of the clouds .",
    "it is in such regions that rapacioli _ et al._@xcite have reported photophysical data for pah clusters , through their mid - ir emission spectrum and photoevaporation properties . in these heated regions",
    ", we predict that for mixed clusters the smallest pah s are located at the periphery and are therefore photoevaporated first . if this is the case , the composition of both aggregated and free interstellar pah s is expected to strongly depend on uv processing .    in this paper we also briefly discussed the intermolecular vibrational modes .",
    "although our results are very preliminary , they already give an idea of the frequencies expected for such modes .",
    "for the stiffest modes , values between 55.6 and 81.3 @xmath4 are found .",
    "they could correspond to bands in the astronomical spectra and can be searched for in the data obtained from the long wavelength spectrometer , which was on board the infrared space observatory.@xcite one difficulty is to disentangle these bands from the numerous intense molecular lines at moderate resolution.@xcite hopefully , the pah cluster features will be revealed by future space missions in the far - ir to submillimeter range , in particular , the herschel space observatory will explore the 16175 @xmath4 range .",
    "in addition to the intermolecular modes obtained from the present model , the influence of the cluster structure on the intramolecular frequencies needs to be quantified , and compared to available astronomical spectra.@xcite investigating the coupling between inter- and intramolecular modes requires a more realistic atomistic description , beyond the rigid - body approximation .",
    "extensions of the tight - binding hamiltonian developed by the parneix group@xcite are currently under development .",
