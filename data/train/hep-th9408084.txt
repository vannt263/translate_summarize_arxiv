    "in unified theories of fundamental interactions , a dilaton field usually appears and couples to other known matter field .",
    "it may play some important role in the history of the early universe or in astrophysics .",
    "it may also provide us a window to see some evidence of higher - dimensional unification .",
    "the coupling constant of the dilaton field depends on the dimension of an internal space and a unification theory .",
    "therefore it is important to see an effect of the coupling on observable phenomena and to investigate a dependence of the coupling constant .    in the einstein - maxwell - dilaton theory , which action is described as @xmath4 ,   \\label{eqn : dilaction}\\ ] ] electrically ( or magnetically ) charged non - rotating black hole@xcite shows very interesting thermodynamical properties depending on a coupling constant @xmath5 of a dilaton field @xmath6 .",
    "( we adopt the units of @xmath7 . )",
    "remind that the case of @xmath8 corresponds to the einstein - maxwell theory , in which the reissner - nordstrm solution is a unique spherically symmetric black hole . if @xmath9 , the thermodynamical property is similar to the reissner - nordstrm black hole , namely , its hawking temperature vanishes in the limit of extremely charged hole .",
    "when we consider a superstring theory ( @xmath10 ) , its temperature in the extreme limit becomes non - zero and finite , while it diverges in the case of @xmath11 .",
    "the last case includes the 5-dimensional kaluza - klein theory , where @xmath12 .",
    "this property of dilatonic black holes indicates that the hawking radiation may be drastically affected by the coupling constant .",
    "shiraishi@xcite also discussed a discharge process by the superradiant modes for non - rotating dilatonic black holes .",
    "although he could not present a definite conclusion because of his analytic wkb approach , his analysis suggests that there is a critical value of the coupling constant . below the critical value ,",
    "the superradiant effect is similar to that of the reissner - nordstrm black hole , while it changes qualitatively beyond that value , i.e. , as the coupling constant increases , the discharge proceeds very rapidly .",
    "+ in this letter , we study the rotating black holes and investigate the effect of dilaton field on the superradiance .",
    "we also look for whether there is a critical value beyond which the property changes qualitatively .",
    "one difficulty in our study is that we do not know the exact solutions of rotating black holes except for two cases : @xmath8 ( kerr - newman ) and @xmath13 .",
    "the latter is the 4-dimensional rotating black hole solution in the 5-dimensional kaluza - klein theory derived by frolov et al @xcite .",
    "we call it the kaluza - klein black hole .",
    "we have , however , the approximate solutions of slowly rotating black holes with arbitrary coupling constant , which were found by horne and horowitz @xcite , and by shiraishi@xcite . + here",

    ", we can point out the fact that @xmath65 for the present model with @xmath66 , which equality happens in the extremely rotating case ( in the kerr limit ) .",
    "+ from eq .",
    "( 12 ) , we find that a superradiance occurs for @xmath67 .",
    "when we quantize a field , we naturally expect spontaneous emission for the superradiant modes , by which a rotating black hole loses the energy and angular momentum@xcite .",
    "the rates of the spontaneous emission for a scalar field is calculated by the formulae @xmath68 where @xmath69 is a reflection coefficient of scalar wave described by eq.([eqn : radialeqn ] ) .",
    "+ in what follow , we assume the charge of the black hole is positive ( @xmath70 ) without loss of generality .",
    "we consider a process in which a charge of the black hole is conserved .",
    "we will show our numerical results only for @xmath71 mode which is the most dominant .",
    "+ remind that a highly rotating case is similar to the kerr black hole . hence we shall restrict our analysis mainly into a highly charged case ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "the result of the kaluza - klein black hole ( @xmath0 ) is shown in fig.2 for @xmath73 with the kerr - newman case ( @xmath2 ) to see the effect of the dilaton coupling . in the kerr - newman case ,",
    "both energy and angular momentum emission rates first increase when the charge of the black hole becomes large , and then they drop to small values near the extreme hole . on the other hand , both rates in the kaluza - klein black hole always increase and seem to diverge to infinity in the limit of the maximal black hole .",
    "therefore , we may conclude that the superradiant emission is affected very much by the dilaton coupling , and the emission rates in the kaluza - klein black hole are much higher than the kerr - newman case , in particular in the extreme limit .",
    "next , we analyze a dependence of the emission rates on the coupling constant @xmath74 . to see this , we consider the slowly rotating solution .",
    "this solution is described as @xcite,@xcite @xmath75 where we introduced new radial coordinate @xmath76 by a transformation , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 with @xmath79 this solution is valid only when @xmath28 is sufficiently small .",
    "although @xmath80 seems to diverge at @xmath81 , @xmath10 and @xmath82 , @xmath80 approaches a finite limiting value exists at each point . +",
    "the angular velocity @xmath38 of this solution diverges for @xmath83 in the maximally charged limit , but vanishes for @xmath84 .",
    "there seems to exist a critical value of the coupling constant , beyond which we expect that the superradiant phenomena would change drastically ( see  .",
    "2 ) . since the maximally charged limit is no longer valid in the present approximation , @xmath85 may not be this critical value .",
    "however , from the analysis of slowly rotating black holes we may still find some qualitative difference in the superradiant phenomena for a large coupling constant as we shall see now .",
    "+ in this approximate solution , we can write down the radial part of the klein - gordon equation as @xmath86 \\chi ( { r}^ * ) = 0   \\label{eqn : kg - slow}\\ ] ] where @xmath87,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath88 is defined by @xmath89 fixing the small angular momentum @xmath73 , we change the charge @xmath90 .",
    "we have analyzed for @xmath91 and @xmath92 in addition to the cases of @xmath93 and @xmath94 , which were already analyzed in  .2 but are included in the present calculations to see the accuracy of the present approximation .",
    "the results of the numerical calculations are shown in fig.3 . +",
    "this calculation shows that when we increase the coupling constant , the superradiant emission rates are enhanced . in particular , for sufficiently large @xmath5 , they diverge in the maximally charged limit , although they seem to approach to a finite value for the small @xmath5 case",
    ". there seems to be a critical value of the coupling constant , below which the emission rates are similar to the kerr - newman case , while beyond which they diverge in the maximally charged limit .",
    "although the present solution we used is only valid for a slowly rotating limit , the comparison of the results with the exact solutions of @xmath95 and @xmath96 suggests that we may extrapolate the present analysis to the case of rather highly charged black hole for which one may expect the present approximation is broken down . from the figure , we find that there is a big change near @xmath1 in the behavior of the emission rates , which is consistent with the previous analysis in  .",
    "2 . we can speculate that the critical value is 1 , which is reduced from a superstring model , as in the case of black - hole temperature@xcite .",
    "here we shall discuss an evolution of rotating dilatonic black holes created in nearly extreme states .",
    "if a black hole has small charge initially , the effect of the dilaton coupling is small because the dilatonic black hole in the limit of @xmath97 always approaches the kerr solution . on the other hand ,",
    "if we consider a highly charged black hole , the black hole with larger coupling constant @xmath5 than the critical value @xmath98 will lose their angular momentum much faster than the black hole with small @xmath5 .",
    "for example , the kaluza - klein black hole loses a half of its initial angular momentum by the factor @xmath99 shorter than the kerr - newman does .",
    "( see fig .",
    "2 ) . + as for the dependence of coupling constant , we may conclude that there is a critical value below and beyond which the qualitative behavior in the superradiance changes drastically .",
    "the critical value would be unity , which is reduced from a superstring model .",
    "+ in this paper , we have considered only the case of conserved charge . if a discharge process exists , black holes with any @xmath5 will approach quickly to the kerr solution , as is pointed out in the kerr - newman case @xcite .",
    "shiraishi @xcite also pointed out that a nonrotating black hole with larger @xmath5 will lose its charge faster than that with small @xmath5 .",
    "therefore we expect that total emission of energy of black hole with larger @xmath100 is larger initially .",
    "but eventually , the difference will get much smaller after some evolution .",
    "+ the contribution from the hawking thermal radiation may become more important than the superradiant effect during the evolution , because the temperature of black hole with large @xmath5 is greater than that with small @xmath101 and it diverges in the maximally charged limit .",
    "if it is the case , our conclusion in this paper would be changed . as holzhey and",
    "wilczek @xcite pointed out , however , the hawking radiation may not be so important if the coupling constant is larger than the critical value , because the potential barrier get very large in the maximally charged limit and may prevent particles from passing through it from the horizon to infinity .",
