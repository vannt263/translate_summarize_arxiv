    "thanks to gravitational amplification , galaxy clusters are a powerful tool to probe distant galaxies . indeed , one of the most distant galaxy detected is a gravitational arc at @xmath1=4.92 in the cluster cl1358 + 62 ( @xcite ) .",
    "other very distant lensed sources ( @xmath23 ) have been identified behind cl0939 + 4713 ( @xcite ) and a2390 ( @xcite , @xcite ) leading to important results on the formation history and evolution of galaxies at large redshift .",
    "determining the redshift of arcs and arclets is of great importance as it fixes the angular scales of the optical configuration , hence giving an absolute cluster mass estimate within the arc radius ( _ e.g. _ @xcite , @xcite ) . but",

    "accurate modeling of cluster potentials based on the analysis of multiple images and weak shear distortions has shown that cluster mass distributions are best described by the sum of a smooth and large scale component ( the cluster ) and the contribution of cluster galaxy halos ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . for",
    "a given mass distribution , kneib et al ( 1996 ) demonstrated that a redshift can be estimated if one can measure accurately the shape of an individual arclet . in order to validate this method and",

    "this model presents many improvements with respect to previous work ( _ e.g. _ @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) as it includes many observational limits such as magnitude ranges , surface brightness cut - off or a choice of the optical waveband , and this for any mass distribution , regardless of its complexity .",

    "et al . 1998a model , is the approximation of circular sources used for the calculation of arclets axis ratio .",
    "indeed , this may underestimate the number of galaxies with axis ratio larger than a certain threshold especially at low redshifts and then bias the predicted redshift distribution . to provide a more accurate and reliable redshift distribution ,",
    "we now take into account the galaxy ellipticity distribution as given by ebbels ( 1998 ) ( this distribution is based on the analysis of hst / mds - like images , and is therefore appropriate to our study ) :    @xmath85 \\label{ell}\\ ] ]    where @xmath86 for an elliptical object with semi major axis @xmath87 and semi minor axis @xmath88 .",

    "such increase in the arclets counts was already observed in bzecourt et al .",
    "( 1998a ) when using a detailed mass distribution but only with circular sources .",
    "considering an ellipticity distribution for the galaxies also increases the arclet counts and strongly modifies the redshift distribution as discussed below . with this refinement ,",
    "the arclet counts prediction is now more consistent with the data over the whole magnitude range",

    "the redshift distributions displayed in figure [ redshift_675 ] present a prominent peak at @xmath109 and a secondary one at @xmath110 due essentially to the contribution of bright and young elliptical - type galaxies in their process of strong star formation .",
    "this second peak is strongly attenuated compared to what was discussed in bzecourt et al .",
    "( 1998a ) where there was clearly a strong excess in the high redshift tail .",

    "this distribution corresponds to more elongated objects than in equation [ ell ] , more arclets appear at low @xmath1 ( figure [ redshift_675 ] , dotted line ) .",
    "however , the total number of arclets is increased by only 11% .",
    "analysis of figure [ redshift_675 ] suggests several comments :    * compared with the redshift distribution of field galaxies within the same observational limits , the arclet distribution is biased towards more distant objects .",
    "we can take advantage of this modification of the redshift distribution to select more distant galaxies in a redshift survey sample .",
    "this is particularly true near the central part of the lens where very high redshift galaxies ( @xmath115 ) have already been found ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . * the two galaxy evolution models presented in this paper ( @xmath106 and @xmath105 ) have been validated in empty fields where the number counts and redshift distribution of galaxies were compatible with the observed ones .",
    "however they present significant differences at high redshift for arclets .",
    "the @xmath106 model with  pure luminosity evolution \" ( ple ) predicts more high redshift arclets than the @xmath105 model where number density evolution is included .",
    "this different behavior of the redshift distribution at @xmath116 is encouraging as it could be a way to distinguish the two scenarios by analyzing the redshift distribution of arclets with @xmath116 .",
    "although it is presently difficult to speculate on the true fraction of very high redshift objects in well defined samples of arclets , this population of very high redshift arclets does not seem to dominate the actual samples .",
    "hence we favor the @xmath105 model corresponding to a merging scenario of galaxy formation and evolution . *",
    "because the high redshift domain is sensitive to many uncertainties included in the evolutionary code ( dust obscuration in the uv , uncertainties in the slope of the imf for massive stars or in their uv tracks , influence of the short time scale phenomena ) , we must be cautious on the above conclusions .",
    "furthermore , the galaxy evolution models assume that all the galaxies form instantaneously at a given redshift , which is a clear limitation of these models ( we have @xmath117 for @xmath106 , which gives for the present day galaxies an age of 16 gyr , and @xmath118 for @xmath105 , corresponding to an age of 12.2 gyr ) . a more phenomenological model of galaxy formation that follows in detail",
    "the mass evolution of galaxy sub units ( @xcite ) may improve this simple description , and would likely be the best to be compared with the current data .      for a simple description of the background population , it is easy to show that the number density of objects brighter than a given magnitude @xmath73 behind a lens is : @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the number density in blank field , @xmath121 is the magnification and @xmath122 is the logarithmic slope of field number counts . an excess or a lack of objects",
    "is then expected for a slope steeper or shallower than 0.4 respectively . in practice ,",
    "optical number counts of field galaxies show a slope smaller than 0.4 in nearly all wavebands ( except in u and b at relatively bright magnitudes ) , so a``depletion '' is expected in most cases , being more pronounced at longer wavelengths ( fort et al .",
    "1996 , taylor et al .",
    "1998 ) .    with our model",
    ", it is possible to compute radial depletion curves instead of global number counts , for any filter or magnitude range .",
    "a clear illustration of the wavelength dependence of the magnification bias is given by the ratio of the number of lensed objects expected in a given area in the field of abell 370 over the number of field galaxies in the same area ( figure [ depletion ] ) .",
    "one can note that the predicted intensity of the depletion is higher at longer wavelengths , as expected , because of the shallower slope of the field galaxies counts .",
    "moreover , because of the flattening of the counts at faint magnitudes , the depletion is also very sensitive to the magnitude threshold ( see the i curve in figure [ depletion ] ) .",
    "uv counts have a slope larger than 0.4 at bright magnitudes ( @xmath123 ) but it quickly decreases at fainter levels .",
    "this fast flattening is due to the lyman break that goes through the red limit of the u filter at redshift @xmath124 .",
    "hence , the lack of objects at faint magnitudes in @xmath33 produces the depletion curve shown in figure [ depletion ] ( see paper ii for more details of the uv modeling ) .",
    "the detection of this magnification bias is highly dependant on the poissonian noise of the background sources and the contamination by cluster members and foreground objects .",
    "this is critical in cluster cores where the density of objects is very low , of the order of a few units per arcmin@xmath125 .",
    "hence , these very poor statistics can not bring valuable information on the sources redshift distribution as most of the information is expected in the dip of the depletion curve .",
    "only massive clusters are able to show such a depletion curve but the recovery of the sources redshift distribution seems out of reach with present datasets .",
    "in this paper , we have presented a new analysis of the cluster lens abell 370 .",
    "thanks to the measurement of the redshift for the b2b3 gravitational pair ( @xmath126 ) and the identification of several new multiple arclets in the wfpc2 image , a more accurate and well constrained model of the mass distribution in abell 370 is proposed , including galaxy scale components .",
    "we studied the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of arclets b3 and a5 which are found to be both young , low metallicity star forming objects without strong interstellar extinction .",
    "the lens model has been used to study the background population of galaxies .",
    "taking the galaxy ellipticity distribution into account induces significant changes in the predicted redshift distribution of arclets .",
    "the excess of very distant sources found in previous analyses is now strongly attenuated and arclets at low redshift are recovered .",
    "for the two prescriptions used on galaxy evolution , although they both reproduce well the number counts in empty fields and in cluster lenses , the `` pure luminosity evolution '' model in a low density universe over predicts the number of high redshift ( @xmath116 ) galaxies , compared to what is currently observed .",
    "if this effect is observationally confirmed it may constrain the number density evolution of galaxies in order to interpret the redshift distribution of arclets .    to understand further the properties of the background population through cluster lenses ,",
    "deep dedicated cluster surveys are needed in order to enlarge the number of arclets and have significant statistical properties .",
    "a multi - color approach is favored as it can help in constraining the redshift distribution .",
    "this is particularly true for those unresolved sources for which no shape information is available and only the spectral energy distribution can discriminate between background objects and cluster members .",
    "in addition , detailed study of their spectral energy distribution will be useful to characterize properties like the luminosity function , dust extinction and star formation histories of distant galaxies ( e.g. pell et al .",
