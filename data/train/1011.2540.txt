    "quantum information and computation are one of the fastest expanding areas of modern physics . among many different physical implementations of qubits ( for a review",
    "see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) the solid state devices seem to be the most promising because of their scalability , tunability and relatively long coherence times .",
    "the spin of a single electron semiconductor quantum dot ( qd ) placed in a magnetic field @xmath0 is a natural two - level system suitable for use as a qubit @xcite .",
    "the zeeman splitting phenomenon is responsible for creation of an energy gap @xmath1 between two electron states with opposite spin .",
    "however , quantum confinement properties of qds can be deeply mutated to crater - like nanostructures ( in other words to ring - shaped qds ) called hereafter quantum rings ( qrs ) @xcite . just like",
    "qds , qrs possess atom - like properties making them attractive candidates for future device applications in quantum information processing .",
    "these nanometer - size rings which are the nanoscopic analogues of benzene have many intriguing properties .",
    "the ability to fill qr with one or a few electrons offers new possibilities , e.g. , to detect persistent current ( pc ) carried by single electron states @xcite or the magnetoinduced change of the ground state @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the possibility of building spin qubits on defect free qrs and show that they can be used for quantum state manipulation .",
    "owing to the strong confinement of electrons in qrs the orbital states are strongly quantized and the electron spin states are very stable due to the substantial suppression of spin - flip mechanisms .",
    "it is well known that qds are one of the best systems for solid state qubit implementations with relaxation times exceeding seconds .",
    "it is thus interesting to relate qubits built on qrs to those on qds . in this context",
    "we show that qrs are also attractive for the realization of spin qubits with relaxation times of the same order as for qds .",
    "the considerations in this paper are general and can be used both for electrostatically defined qrs ( eqrs ) @xcite and self - assembled qrs ( sqrs)@xcite .",
    "eqrs can be primarily controlled electrically , sqrs can be primarily controlled optically .    in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we introduce basic characteristics of quantum rings , discuss the formation of spin qubits and provide a brief description of how to manipulate their states . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we make estimations of the relaxation and decoherence times .",
    "general discussion of possible experimental realizations is given in section [ sec4 ] and conclusions are presented in section [ sec5 ] .",
    "nowadays technology allows the preparation and characterization of very small , high - mobility semiconductor structures of dot or ring geometry with very good resolution . recently several high - quality quantum rings on , e.g. , algaas - gaas heterostructures @xcite , ingaas @xcite and gaas @xcite have been produced and investigated .",
    "here we consider a semiconductor qr of radius @xmath2 and finite thickness containing a _ single or a few electrons_. the ring is placed in a static magnetic field parallel ( @xmath3 ) or perpendicular ( @xmath4 ) to its plane .",
    "the in - plane orientation is favourable as it does not disturb the orbital levels @xcite .",
    "the nanometer size of the ring causes quantum size effects important .    for a @xmath5 ring in a static magnetic field @xmath6",
    "we assume the hamiltonian in the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the effective electron mass , @xmath9 is the vector potential , @xmath10 is the confinement potential the exact form of which will be given later in the text .",
    "if the ring is placed in a parallel magnetic field @xmath3 instead of @xmath6 then @xmath11 . the energy spectrum of a qr consists of a set of discrete levels @xmath12 due to radial motion with radial quantum numbers @xmath13 , and rotational motion with angular momentum quantum numbers @xmath14 .",
    "the single particle wave function is of the form @xmath15 with the radial part @xmath16 and the spin part @xmath17 . for finite  width qrs both @xmath12 and @xmath18 have to be calculated numerically @xcite . in contradiction to qds",

    "+ the application of a magnetic field @xmath21 splits the orbital energy levels by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the electron spin @xmath24-factor and @xmath25 is the bohr magneton .",
    "another important energy gap is the distance from the highest occupied orbital state ( @xmath20 ) to the first excited orbital state ( @xmath26 ) , @xmath27 if the following relation holds    @xmath28    the two zeeman sublevels of the orbital @xmath20 are well separated from the others and the ring can be well approximated as a two - state system ( a qubit ) .",

    "additionally , we neglect any imperfectnesses that are present in real rings ( impurities , variable thickness , etc . ) .    in order to use quantum rings in quantum computation",
    "it is necessary to establish a way to perform single qubit operations and to implement efficient quantum logic gates on pairs of qubits . during the past few years a big progress",
    "have been made towards full control of quantum states of single and coupled spins in qds @xcite .",
    "going carefully through all this one finds that most of those features are shared also by ring - shaped qds .",
    "+ the qr qubit can be initialized by , e.g. , thermal equilibration or by optical pumping , coherently manipulated ( through magnetic resonance technique or by faster electrical and optical gates ) and read out using both electrical and optical techniques @xcite .",
    "coherent coupling of eqrs leading to the formation of , e.g. , the cnot gate can be obtained in an analogous way as for qds @xcite , by assembling a system of two coplanar qrs with the possibility of tuning their exchange coupling @xmath59 by gating the barrier between them .",
    "such coupling can be switched on and off by electrical impulses .",
    "quantum gates for sqrs can be accomplished by electronic or photonic connections @xcite .",
    "single qubit rotations together with the cnot gate form an universal set of quantum logic gates .",
    "remarkably the operations are very fast , on the order of pico to nanoseconds @xcite .",
    "thus very many coherent operations can be performed during the decoherence times estimated in section [ sec3 ] .",
    "recently a scheme for creating coherent coupling of spin qubits , each placed in a microcavity , by entanglement swapping @xcite has been proposed .",
    "such long - distance entanglement is a crucial ingredient for quantum communication .",
    "the long term promise of spin qubits depends crucially on the relaxation and decoherence times which are strongly related to the quantization of the orbital states in qrs and can be different than in qds due to different geometry .    as the experiments were performed mainly at @xmath60 t , in the following we fix the magnitude of the magnetic field to @xmath61 t .",
    "we also assume the electron spin @xmath24-factor @xmath62 for ingaas samples @xcite , which gives the electron spin zeeman splitting @xmath63mev .",
    "the main difficulty in development of a quantum computer is to keep the qubits in the quantum regime for a sufficiently long time .",
    "the ideal situation would be to cut off the interaction with the environment that is the main source of destruction of a quantum state .",
    "this is , however , a very difficult task as this interaction is equally needed ( for steering , measurement , etc . ) as unwanted ( decoherence , relaxation ) .",
    "electron spin decoherence is caused primarily by spin - lattice relaxation via phonon scattering and spin - orbit ( soi ) interaction and by hyperfine ( hfi ) interaction with nuclear spins @xcite .",
    "at first we discuss the spin relaxation time @xmath64 . at magnetic fields @xmath65 t the dominant relaxation mechanism is the hfi but for larger fields this mechanism is suppressed by the mismatch between the nuclear and electron zeeman energies . at @xmath66t@xmath67 t",
    "the soi causes spin relaxation by mixing the spin and orbital states and providing the mechanism for coupling of spins to ( mainly ) piezoelectric phonons .",
    "the prolongation of spin relaxation times for small nanostructures stems from a drastic reduction in spin - phonon coupling mediated by the combination of electron - phonon and soi , due to strong confinement .",
    "the comprehensive analysis of relaxation due to phonons in qds has been given in refs .",
    "it was shown that at @xmath61 t the relaxation is dominated by a single  phonon admixture process ; it has been verified in several experiments @xcite . to discuss the relaxation we have followed ref .",
    "@xcite and in particular eq . 7 , which is valid for a set of confining potentials and therefore for different shapes of the sample .",

    "this method of transforming s - k qd into qr structures has been successfully applied to ingaas qds grown on gaas surfaces by different epitaxial methods - metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy @xcite and molecular beam epitaxy @xcite .",
    "another method , namely liquid droplet epitaxy can be applied , if in the process of vapor phase epitaxial growth of binary , or multinary materials , one of the constituting elements can occur in liquid phase at the growth surface .",
    "this method is usually used for growing qr like structures from gaas and ingas @xcite . usually the sqrs structures obtained by the s - k qd growth followed by a post - growth annealing , as well as those grown by droplet epitaxy have radii in the range of 14 to 50 nm @xcite . in method ( ii )",
    "the appropriate potential profiles confining carriers into qr geometry can be realized either by etching the qr like patterns from the layered heterostructures @xcite or by depositing the metallic gates defining the appropriate electrostatic potential profiles , on top of structures with 2-dimensional electron ( or hole ) gas @xcite .",
    "+ b ) _ qrs with @xmath152 nm occupied by a _ single electron _ have the required relaxation times . _    despite the difficulties in producing such small structures the successful realization of the mbe grown inas qr structures , with radius of 11.5 nm has been reported @xcite and used in our considerations .",
    "another possibility of practical realization of the qr structures with radii in the range of 10 nm ( or less ) is the combination of axial and radial heterostructures in one semiconductor nanowire ( nw ) , i.e. the growth of a heterojunction in the nw shell with appropriate combination of materials , for example a nw with algaas core , gaas shell , and thin inas section within the gaas shell only .",
    "this type of nw structures have not been realized yet , to our knowledge , however due to the very rapid progress in the nw growth technology the future realization of such structures can be anticipated .",
    "recently mohseni et .",
    "@xcite reported the qr - like confinement of electrons on top parts of core - shell gaasp / gap nanowires grown by molecular beam epitaxy .",
    "the use of nanowires has some advantages in comparison to the qd or qr structures fabricated by the s - k or liquid droplet epitaxy growth methods .",
    "nws can easily be grown on pre - patterned substrates , i.e. they can be oriented in plane in periodical structures , defined by the patterning process @xcite .",
    "the dimension of nws can also be precisely controlled .",
    "in particular the radii of nws can be smaller than 5 nm @xcite , which is rather impossible in case of self assembled qds .",
    "the successful realization of structures which are closer to nano - ring geometries namely semiconductor nanotubes was also reported for some semiconducting materials like si @xcite , zno @xcite , or gan @xcite .",
    "however realization of qr structures would need implementation of axial heterostructures in nanotube geometries , which has not been demonstrated yet , to our knowledge .",
    "another possibility is to define a set of qrs in a nanotube by local gate electrodes .",
    "probably the combination of confinement due to the electric potential defined by metallic gates in the small sections of core shell nanowire structures , already successfully applied to define qd like potential @xcite seems , at present to be the best method for realization of qr type confinement studied in our paper .",
    "it seems that the relatively thin rings of radius smaller than @xmath153 nm with relaxation times exceeding seconds are within reach for nowadays nanotechnology .",
    "quantum information processing and spintronics have been major driving forces towards full control of single - spin systems . in particular fascinating phenomena based on carrier confinement in ring shaped nanostructures",
    "have intrigued physicists for many years .",
    "it was found that nanorings with @xmath154 nm can be considered as almost ideal quantum systems @xcite and thus can be , besides qds , excellent systems for spin studies .",
    "we have investigated quantum rings with a single or a few electrons and have shown that they can be treated as quantum bits fulfilling divincenzo criteria @xcite .",
    "we have shown that for both qds and qrs long relaxation times exceeding seconds at @xmath61 t are possible .",
    "it follows from our analysis that for singly occupied structures qds have always longer relaxation time than qrs but for relatively thin rings with higher occupation the relaxation times can exceed those for qds .",
    "however ( see e.g. table [ table1 ] ) even singly occupied rings with @xmath155 nm can have relaxation times exceeding seconds .",
    "the single occupancy of rings makes the experiments and the analysis more transparent , however , there is an open question whether qubits with @xmath156 can have some other advantages over those with @xmath91 .",
    "the presented considerations demonstrate the feasibility of operating single - electron spin in qr as the quantum bit .",
    "this is of big relevance for the use in quantum information processing devices .",
    "finally , it should be stressed that multiply connected ring geometry offers additional ( orbital ) degree of freedom to be used for quantum manipulations .",
    "it is possible to build a qubit also on the orbital degrees of freedom @xcite in some analogy to flux qubits on superconducting rings .",
    "thus quantum carrier confinement in circular nanostructures can be the basis of many applications in quantum information processing devices .",
