    "measurements of the cosmic distance - redshift relation have always constituted one of the most important probes of the cosmological model .",
    "eighty years ago such observations provided evidence that the universe is expanding ; more recently they have convincingly suggested that this expansion rate is accelerating .",
    "the distance - redshift relation depends on the expansion history of the universe , which is in turn governed by its physical contents including the properties of the `` dark energy '' which has been hypothesized to be driving the accelerating expansion .",
    "one of the most important challenges in contemporary cosmology is to distinguish between the different possible physical models for dark energy , which include a material or scalar field smoothly filling the universe with a negative equation - of - state , a modification to the laws of gravity at large cosmic scales , or the effects of inhomogeneity on cosmological observations .",
    "cosmological distance measurements provide one of the crucial observational datasets to help distinguish between these different models .",
    "one of the most powerful tools for mapping the distance - redshift relation is type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) .",
    "about a decade ago , observations of nearby and distant sne ia provided some of the most compelling evidence that the expansion rate of the universe is accelerating ( riess et al .  1998 , perlmutter et al .  1999 ) , in agreement with earlier suggestions based on comparisons of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and large - scale structure data ( efstathiou , sutherland & maddox 1990 , krauss & turner 1995 , ostriker & steinhardt 1995 ) . since then the sample of sne ia available for cosmological analysis has grown impressively due to a series of large observational projects which has populated the hubble diagram across a range of redshifts .",
    "these projects include the nearby supernova factory ( copin et al .",
    "2006 ) , the center for astrophysics sn group ( hicken et al .",
    "2009 ) , the carnegie supernova project ( hamuy et al .",
    "2006 ) and the palomar transient factory ( law et al .",
    "2009 ) at low redshifts @xmath8 ; the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) supernova survey ( kessler et al .  2009 ) at low - to - intermediate redshifts @xmath9 ; the supernova legacy survey ( astier et al .",
    "2006 ) and essence ( wood - vasey et al .  2007 ) projects at intermediate redshifts @xmath10 ; and observations by the hubble space telescope at high redshifts @xmath11 ( riess et al .  2004 , 2007 ; dawson et al .  2009 ) .",
    "these supernovae data have been collected and analyzed in a homogeneous fashion in the `` union '' sne compilations , initially by kowalski et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and most recently by amanullah et al .",
    "( 2010 ) in the `` union 2 '' sample of 557 sne ia .",
    "the utility of these supernovae datasets is now limited by known ( and potentially unknown ) systematic errors which could bias cosmological fits if not handled correctly .",
    "these systematics include redshift - dependent astrophysical effects , such as potential drifts with redshift in the relations between colour , luminosity and light curve shape owing to evolving sne ia populations , and systematics in analysis such as the fitting of light curves , photometric zero - points , k - corrections and malmquist bias .",
    "although these systematics have been treated very thoroughly in recent supernovae analyses , it is clearly desirable to cross - check the cosmological conclusions with other probes of the distance - redshift relation .    a very promising and complementary method for mapping the distance - redshift relation is the measurement of baryon acoustic oscillations ( baos ) in the large - scale clustering pattern of galaxies , and their application as a cosmological standard ruler ( eisenstein , hu & tegmark 1998 , cooray et al .",
    "2001 , eisenstein 2003 , blake & glazebrook 2003 , seo & eisenstein 2003 , linder 2003 , hu & haiman 2003 ) .",
    "baos correspond to a preferred length scale imprinted in the distribution of photons and baryons by the propagation of sound waves in the relativistic plasma of the early universe ( peebles & yu 1970 , sunyaev & zeldovitch 1970 , bond & efstathiou 1984 , holtzman 1989 , hu & sugiyama 1996 , eisenstein & hu 1998 ) .",
    "this length scale , which corresponds to the sound horizon at the baryon drag epoch denoted by @xmath12 , may be predicted very accurately by measurements of the cmb which yield the physical matter and baryon densities that control the sound speed , expansion rate and recombination time in the early universe : the latest determination is @xmath13 mpc ( komatsu et al .",
    "2009 ) . in the pattern of late - time galaxy clustering ,",
    "baos manifest themselves as a small preference for pairs of galaxies to be separated by @xmath12 , causing a distinctive `` baryon acoustic peak '' to be imprinted in the 2-point galaxy correlation function .",
    "the corresponding signature in fourier space is a series of decaying oscillations or `` wiggles '' in the galaxy power spectrum .",
    "measurement of baos has become an important motivation for galaxy redshift surveys in recent years .",
    "the small amplitude of the baryon acoustic peak , and the large size of the relevant scales , implies that cosmic volumes of order 1 gpc@xmath14 must be mapped with of order @xmath15 galaxies to ensure a robust detection ( tegmark 1997 , blake & glazebrook 2003 , glazebrook & blake 2005 , blake et al .",
    "significant detections of baos have now been reported by three independent galaxy surveys , spanning a range of redshifts @xmath16 : the sdss , the wigglez dark energy survey , and the 6-degree field galaxy survey ( 6dfgs ) .",
    "the most accurate bao measurements have been obtained by analyzing the sdss , particularly the luminous red galaxy ( lrg ) component .",
    "eisenstein et al .",
    "( 2005 ) reported a convincing detection of the acoustic peak in the 2-point correlation function of the sdss third data release ( dr3 ) lrg sample with effective redshift @xmath17 .",

    "other studies of the sdss lrg sample , producing broadly similar conclusions , have been undertaken by hutsi ( 2006 ) , percival et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , snchez et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and kazin et al .",
    "( 2010a ) .",
    "these studies of sdss galaxy samples built on hints of baos reported by the 2-degree field galaxy redshift survey ( percival et al .",
    "2001 , cole et al .",
    "2005 ) and combinations of smaller datasets ( miller et al .",
    "there have also been potential bao detections in photometric - redshift catalogues from the sdss ( blake et al .",
    "2007 , padmanabhan et al .",
    "2007 , crocce et al .  2011 ) , although the statistical significance of these measurements currently remains much lower than that which can be obtained using spectroscopic redshift catalogues .",
    "these bao detections have recently been supplemented by new measurements from two different surveys , which have extended the redshift coverage of the standard - ruler technique . in the low - redshift universe",
    "the 6dfgs has reported a bao detection at @xmath20 ( beutler et al .",
    "this study produced a @xmath21 measurement of the standard ruler scale and a new determination of the hubble constant @xmath22 . at higher redshifts",
    "the wigglez survey has quantified baos at @xmath23 , producing a @xmath24 measurement of the baryon acoustic scale ( blake et al .",
    ". taken together , these different galaxy surveys have demonstrated that bao standard - ruler measurements are self - consistent with the standard cosmological model established from cmb observations , and have yielded new , tighter constraints on cosmological parameters .",
    "the accuracy with which baos may be used to determine the distance - redshift relation using current surveys is limited by statistical rather than systematic errors ( in contrast to observations of sne ia ) . the measurement error in the large - scale correlation function , which governs",
    "how accurately the preferred scale may be extracted , is determined by the volume of the large - scale structure mapped and the number density and bias of the galaxy tracers .",
    "there are indeed potential systematic errors associated with fitting models to the bao signature , which are caused by the modulation of the pattern of linear clustering laid down in the high - redshift universe by the non - linear scale - dependent growth of structure , the distortions apparent when the signal is observed in redshift - space and the bias with which galaxies trace the network of matter fluctuations .",
    "however , the fact that the baos are imprinted on large , linear and quasi - linear scales of the clustering pattern means that these non - linear , systematic distortions are amenable to analytical or numerical modelling and the leading - order effects are well - understood ( eisenstein , seo & white 2007 , crocce & scoccimarro 2008 , matsubara 2008 , snchez , baugh & angulo 2008 , smith , scoccimarro & sheth 2008 , seo et al .",
    "2008 , padmanabhan & white 2009 ) . as such , baos in current datasets",
    "are believed to provide a robust probe of the cosmological model , relatively free of systematic error and dominated by statistical errors . in this sense",
    "they provide a powerful cross - check of the distance - redshift relation mapped by supernovae .",
    "in this study we report our final analysis of the baryon acoustic peak from the angle - averaged correlation function of the completed wigglez survey dataset , in which we present distance - scale measurements as a function of redshift between @xmath25 and @xmath26 , including a covariance matrix which may be applied in cosmological parameter fits .",
    "we also present a new measurement of the correlation function of the sdss - lrg sample .",
    "we stack the 6dfgs , sdss - lrg and wigglez correlation functions to produce the highest - significance detection to date of the baryon acoustic peak in the galaxy clustering pattern .",
    "we perform cosmological parameter fits to this latest bao distance dataset , now comprising data points at six different redshifts . by comparing these fits with those performed on the latest compilation of sne ia ,",
    "we search for systematic disagreements between these two important probes of the distance - redshift relation .",
