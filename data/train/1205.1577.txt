    "the orion - kl region is a high - mass star - forming region that has been extensively studied because of its rich chemical inventory .",
    "a literature search reveals that over 50 microwave , millimeter , and submillimeter spectral line surveys have been reported for this source .",
    "previous molecular observations of orion - kl have involved both spectral line surveys to determine the source composition , and imaging studies to explore the relative distributions of molecules in this complicated region .",
    "imaging studies of molecular emission have indicated that the chemistry of orion - kl displays so - called nitrogen - oxygen  chemical differentiation , \" with the emission from nitrogen - bearing molecules such as methyl cyanide [ ch@xmath3cn ] and ethyl cyanide [ c@xmath1h@xmath2cn ] tracing the orion hot core , and emission from oxygen - bearing molecules such as methyl formate [ hcooch@xmath3 ] and dimethyl ether [ ( ch@xmath3)@xmath1o ] tracing the orion compact ridge .",
    "the concept of nitrogen - oxygen chemical differentiation is based on the positions of the emissions peaks for these two classes of molecules being spatially - separated . in the case of the orion - kl source",
    ", this concept dates back to the the first reported millimeter line survey @xcite , where the spectral lines from these two classes of molecules were found to have different rest velocities and were therefore assumed to occupy different parcels of gas .",
    "the follow - up imaging studies that ranged over the last two decades confirmed this differentiation through imaging of molecular emission at @xmath61 arcsecond spatial resolution .",
    "the concept of spatially distinct regions containing n - bearing and o - bearing molecules in orion - kl was first called into question by @xcite , who showed that the acetone molecule [ ( ch@xmath3)@xmath1co ] traces the gas at the intersection of the regions shown to contain spatially - distinct n - bearing and o - bearing molecules .",
    "furthermore , a recent @xmath5=3 mm continuum imaging study at subarcsecond spatial resolution shows that orion - kl is comprised of numerous , compact , bright continuum sources @xcite .",
    "the results of this study suggest that much of the molecular emission may actually trace these compact regions , rather than the more extended structures traditionally associated with the hot core and compact ridge @xcite .",
    "observational studies reporting molecular column densities and/or abundances in orion - kl generally rely upon a set of assumptions regarding the molecular emission in this region .",
    "these assumptions are based on the previous imaging studies of molecular emission in this source , and include : 1 .",
    "oxygen - bearing molecules are located in the compact ridge , while nitrogen - bearing molecules are located in the hot core ; 2 .",
    "the emission regions are approximately spherical and @xmath75   in diameter for both sources ; 3 .",
    "molecules from these sources have rotational temperatures in the 150 - 200 k range .",
    "if these assumptions are not valid at higher spatial resolutions , this would have significant implications for chemical modeling of star - forming regions .",
    "current state - of - the - art models assume that all of the molecules are co - spatial @xcite .",
    "furthermore , molecular abundances and temperatures are commonly used as benchmarks for comparison between model results and observations .",
    "determination of molecular abundances in orion - kl relies upon an accurate source structure model for each molecule so that appropriate beam dilution corrections can be applied .",
    "in addition to these important considerations , it has also recently been suggested that chemical imaging of interstellar sources can be used to probe the chemical mechanisms at work in these environments @xcite .",
    "if various classes of complex molecules are shown to occupy different parcels of gas , hydrodynamic models will be required to explain this chemical differentiation and the underlying chemistry and physics that drives such a separation .",
    "high - resolution imaging studies of the molecular distributions in sources like orion - kl are therefore crucial for the advancement of chemical models of hot cores .    to this end",
    ", we have carried out interferometric observations over a range of spatial resolutions toward orion - kl using the combined array for research in millimeter - wave astronomy ( carma ) .",
    "these spectral line and imaging observations target several complex molecules previously detected in this region , including acetone [ ( ch@xmath3)@xmath1co ] , dimethyl ether [ ( ch@xmath3)@xmath1o ] , methyl formate [ hcooch@xmath3 ] , ethyl cyanide [ c@xmath1h@xmath2cn ] , formic acid [ hcooh ] , and acetaldehyde [ ch@xmath3cho ] .",
    "we present here the spatial distributions and scales of the observed molecules and discuss the implications of these results in terms of the chemistry of the orion - kl region .",
    "additional information pertaining to the kinematics of orion - kl based on these molecular observations are presented in a follow - up study ( friedel & widicus weaver 2012 , submitted ; hereafter , paper ii ) .",
    "carma was used in its b , d , and a configurations to conduct observations in 2007 december , 2008 july , and 2009 january , respectively .",
    "two 7 hour tracks were taken in b configuration , one 6 hour track was taken in d configuration , and four 5 - 6 hour tracks in a configuration .",
    "the phase center for all observations was @xmath8(j2000 ) = @xmath9 and @xmath10(j2000 ) = @xmath11 .",
    "the synthesized beam sizes are @xmath12 for the d configuration , @xmath13 for the b configuration , and @xmath14 for the a configuration .",
    "one arcsecond is @xmath7414 au at the distance of orion - kl .",
    "the projected baselines of the observations are 3.0 - 35.3 k@xmath5 ( 10 - 118 m , d configuration ) , 21.8 - 257.5 k@xmath5 ( 73 - 860 m , b configuration ) , and 38.0 - 467.2 k@xmath5 ( 127 - 1560 m , a configuration ) . structures larger than @xmath730 arcseconds are resolved out for observations with this range of @xmath15 coverage .",
    "the correlator setup for the observations in the b and d configurations included six 31 mhz wide windows for observations of continuum and spectral lines ( three in each sideband ) , with 63 channels per window , yielding a channel spacing of 488 khz ( @xmath71.4 km s@xmath16 ) .",
    "the flux density was calibrated using observations of uranus and mars , and the antenna - based gains were calibrated using observations of 0541 - 056 . for two of the a configuration tracks , the correlator setup included four 31 mhz wide windows and two 500 mhz wide windows ( three windows in each sideband ) .",
    "a third a configuration track was conducted with four 31 mhz windows and eight 500 mhz windows , and the fourth track with eight 31 mhz windows and four 62 mhz windows .",
    "self - calibration on the sio maser at 86.243 ghz was used to perform the antenna - based gain calibration for the a configuration tracks , with the solution being bootstrapped to the other windows .",
    "observations of 0607 - 085 were used to determine and remove phase offsets between the other windows and the sio window .",
    "the high spatial resolution in the a configuration observations led to the flux calibrators being heavily resolved ; comparison to previously measured fluxes of 0607 - 085 allowed amplitude gains to be calculated for these a configuration observations , and the resultant amplitudes are accurate to within @xmath720% .",
    "the passband of the 31 mhz windows was corrected using the internal noise source .",
    "the passbands of the 62 mhz and 500 mhz windows were corrected using observations of 0423 - 013 .",
    "all calibration , continuum subtraction , and imaging was performed using the miriad software package @xcite .",
    "the transitions targeted in these observations are listed in table  [ tab : mols ] .",
    "this table includes the rest frequencies , quantum numbers , symmetry label , upper state energy , and linestrength information for each transition .",
    "this table also includes information pertaining to the details of the observations , including beam size , rms noise level , and array configuration for each observation .",
    "note that in many cases , lines arising from several of the transitions are blended .",
    "rotational temperatures can not be reliably determined from such a small number of lines .",
    "therefore , the relative contributions of each transition to the overall flux of any given blended line also can not be determined from this information .",
    "the transitions listed in the lower section of the table ( below the line ) were detected in single channels of the wideband windows of the a configuration observations .",
    "while no velocity information can be determined for these transitions , they can be mapped to give spatial information .",

    "the exception to this trend is the weakly emitting , and extended , hcooch@xmath3  region to the south and southeast .",

    "it is apparent from these observations that the spatial distribution of complex organic molecules in the orion - kl region is much more complicated than has previously been considered .",
    "although the emission peaks arising from different molecules in orion - kl are in some cases spatially distinct , the bulk of the emission arises from areas with spatial overlap between the molecules .",
    "additionally , the molecular emission is not necessarily centered on either the hot core or compact ridge sources .",
    "these observations confirm that nitrogen / oxygen  chemical differentiation \" in its strictest definition ",
    "i.e. where these two classes of molecules display spatially - distinct emissions peaks  is verified . however , previous conclusions drawn about the chemistry of this region based on the assumption that these two classes of molecules arise from spatially - distinct parcels of gas are not accurate .    the distribution of several molecules ( e.g. ( ch@xmath3)@xmath1o  and hcooch@xmath3 ) also show compact emission peaks near known stars , indicating that these species are either being liberated from grain surfaces or produced in the gas phase in the warmer gas around embedded stars .",
    "furthermore , much of the emission attributed to the compact ridge has been shown , through these higher spatial resolution observations , to actually arise from nearby compact sources rather than from the more extended compact ridge feature identified in lower - resolution images .    as was stated above",
    ", the routine assumptions made when conducting molecular observations toward the orion - kl region are : 1 .",
    "oxygen - bearing molecules are located in the compact ridge , while nitrogen - bearing molecules are located in the hot core ; 2 .",
    "the emission regions are approximately spherical and @xmath75   in diameter for both sources ; 3 .",
    "molecules from these sources have rotational temperatures in the 150 - 200 k range . in light of the results reported here",
    ", this view of the distribution of complex organic molecules in orion - kl is in serious need of revision , as are the molecular abundances derived from these assumptions . given that most of the molecules studied here display emission in many compact and spatially - distinct clumps scattered throughout the orion - kl region , it is likely that each of these compact regions has its own distinct physical environment , spatial distribution , and chemical network .",
    "however , interactions between these regions may in fact be driving new chemistry , as is illustrated by the comparison of the acetone distribution to those of methyl formate and ethyl cyanide .",
    "we conclude from these results that it is no longer valid to assume all of these molecules are forming under the same chemical and physical conditions , nor is it valid to impose a simplistic model of `` chemical differentiation '' for n - bearing and o - bearing molecules in this source . based on these results ,",
    "it is clear that chemical models should be developed that include hydrodynamic simulations so that a more realistic picture of the chemistry of star - forming regions can be developed . likewise ,",
    "new models that properly determine the corrections for complicated spatial distributions must be developed so that molecular abundances can be adjusted to account for the observed spatial distributions .",
    "given that this study only included a small sample of the total chemical inventory of the orion - kl region , additional observational studies that provide high - resolution spatial images of many different molecules are also merited .",
    "we have presented carma observations of several molecular species , including ethyl cyanide , methyl formate , acetone , and formic acid , toward orion - kl .",
    "these observations cover over an order of magnitude in spatial resolution , yielding excellent sensitivity to both small- and large - scale structures . from these results , we conclude that the traditional view of orion - kl  that of a nitrogen - oxygen `` chemically differentiated '' region  is not valid for interpretation of high spatial resolution observations . the emission from nitrogen",
    "bearing and oxygen bearing species arise not only from the hot core and compact ridge , but from multiple components of the cloud that include a wide range of spatial scales and physical conditions .",
    "most importantly , while the emission peaks for nitrogen- or oxygen - bearing species are spatially distinct , in the majority of the emission regions these molecules are co - spatial .",
    "additionally , several of the oxygen bearing molecules ( hcooch@xmath3 , ( ch@xmath3)@xmath1co , hcooh , & ch@xmath3oh ) do not have similar distributions or peak positions .",
    "thus , the traditional view of orion - kl and other sources that are thought to display nitrogen - oxygen  chemical differentiation \" should be revised .",
    "further observations of other molecular species are needed to develop a more complete chemical understanding of this source .",
    "this study also has long - term implications for the field of astrochemistry , as it calls into question the traditional approach used when searching for new molecules .",
    "while single - dish observations are powerful , the results presented here show that such observations must be combined with interferometric studies that probe the molecular spatial distribution .",
    "only these combined observational techniques will provide the information required for accurate determination of molecular abundances .",
    "furthermore , unbiased spectral line surveys are preferable over targeted searches , as such surveys will reveal the potentially diverse chemical composition of a source rather than targeting specific types of chemistry .",
    "the powerful combination of spectral line surveys with interferometric observations is the next step in unraveling the mysteries of complex chemistry in star - forming regions .",
    "such studies are rapidly becoming possible using the next generation of correlator technology that will soon become available at the carma observatory , as well as those being implemented at the extended very large array ( evla ) and the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) .",
