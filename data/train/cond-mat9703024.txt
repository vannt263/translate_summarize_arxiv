    "the problem of the dynamics of growing surfaces has attracted very much attention in recent years .",
    "a large variety of discrete models and continuous equations have been investigated numerically and analytically in order to explain the diversity of rough surfaces observed in non - equilibrium natural processes @xcite . in many cases",
    ", it is observed that the surface morphology displays time and space fluctuations which have scaling properties akin to those of equilibrium critical phenomena .",
    "most of the work is thus devoted to identifying the different universality classes to which the models studied belong , which are basically determined by the exponents characterizing the fluctuations of the interface .",
    "we will be interested in this work in the dynamics of a one dimensional surface , which will be described by the stochastic variable @xmath0 giving the height of the surface at time @xmath1 above substrate position @xmath2 .",
    "the physical properties of the system are thus described by the moments of @xmath0 .",
    "for instance , the _ global _ width @xmath3 is a measure of the interface fluctuations . in ( [ global ] )",
    ", @xmath4 denotes spatial average over the whole system of lateral size @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the average value of the height at time @xmath1 , and @xmath7 is an average over realizations of the noise . starting from a initially flat surface , the global width is observed to satisfy in many cases the dynamic scaling _ ansatz _ of family - vicsek @xcite , @xmath8 where the scaling function @xmath9 behaves as @xmath10 the roughness exponent @xmath11 characterizes the surface morphology in the stationary regime , in which the correlation length @xmath12 ( @xmath13 is the so called dynamic exponent ) has reached a value larger than the system size @xmath5 .",
    "this happens for times larger than the saturation time , @xmath14 , which scales with @xmath5 as @xmath15 .",
    "the ratio @xmath16 is called growth exponent and characterizes the short time behavior of the surface .",
    "the existence of dynamic scaling as in ( [ fv - globalwidth ] ) , plus the assumption of the self - affine character of the interface in the sense that there is no characteristic length scale in the surface besides the system size , and therefore all scales obey the same physics allows one to obtain the exponents from the _ local _ width @xmath17 , which measures the surface height fluctuations over a window of size @xmath18 . at times larger than @xmath19 the local width",
    "is thus expected to saturate and @xmath20 where the _ local _ roughness exponent @xmath21 should equal the exponent obtained in ( [ fv - globalwidth],[fv - forf ] ) , @xmath22 . for short times , @xmath23 ,",
    "the local width scales with time as @xmath24 , which is the short scale analog of the scaling behavior for the global width given in ( [ fv - globalwidth ] ) .",
    "it is an interesting fact to stress here that the equality @xmath25 in ( [ loc - rough - exp ] ) is _ not _ guaranteed in general when family - vicsek scaling holds for the global width ( [ fv - forf ] ) , since the self - affinity of the interface is an additional independent condition .",
    "although the above scaling picture has been successfully applied to a great variety of models , which includes for instance the importat universality classes associated to the edwards - wilkinson ( ew ) @xcite and kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) @xcite equations , it is not always valid . in very recent studies of discrete models and continuum equations , mainly related with the growth of surfaces by molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe )",
    ", it has been found that in the case of the so - called _ super - rough _ surfaces , _",
    "i.e. _ for surfaces with a global roughness exponent @xmath26 , the usual assumption of the equivalence between the global and local descriptions of the surface is not valid . in these systems",
    "@xcite the local width ( or equivalently the height - height correlation function , see below ) does not saturate as expected in the standard family - vicsek scaling , but crosses over to a new behavior in the intermediate time regime @xmath27 , characterized by a different growth exponent @xmath28 , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 .",
    "it is easy to see that now the local width saturates only when the global width does ( this is , @xmath31 for all @xmath32 ) and @xmath33 in saturation , which , according to ( [ loc - rough - exp ] ) , yields a local exponent @xmath34 for super - roughening .",
    "this scaling behavior which is not encompassed by the the family - vicsek ansatz has been termed _",
    "anomalous scaling _ in the literature @xcite and later different models have been studied in which @xmath21 and @xmath28 take values different from 1 and @xmath35 , respectively @xcite .",
    "while it is currently clearly understood that super - roughening always leads to anomalous scaling , in a recent paper @xcite two of us have demonstrated that growth models in which @xmath36 may also exhibit an unconventional scaling behavior with similar scaling relations between exponents . in that reference ,",
    "for an analytically solvable growth model with tunable values of @xmath37 , we identified anomalous dynamic scaling with the lack of self - affinity .",
    "also a class of discrete mbe growth models studied numerically in ref.@xcite behaves anomalously , although the interfaces generated were not super - rough at all .",
    "that is , surfaces can display anomalous scaling _ no matter _ what their value of the global roughness exponent is , either @xmath26 or @xmath36 . in the presence of anomalous scaling , not all length scales are equivalent in the system ; the scaling behavior is different for short ( local ) and large length scales , hence @xmath21 and @xmath37 differ .",
    "our aim in the present paper is to complete the picture presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , showing that the mechanisms which lead to anomalous scaling behavior can be separated into two classes , according to the behavior of the structure factor or power spectrum of the surface , @xmath38 , to be defined below .",
    "one of the mechanisms is super - roughening , even if @xmath38 behaves as in the family - vicsek case .",
    "the other mechanism corresponds to what we term _ intrinsic _ anomalous scaling of the structure factor , where an independent exponent appears which measures the difference between the short and large length scale power laws , namely , the difference between the local and global roughness exponents @xmath21 and @xmath37 .",
    "we will show how to identify the corresponding anomalous scaling by extracting the independent critical exponents from the correlation functions .",
    "as stated above , for simplicity we restric our further analysis to growth models in one dimension , but the conclusions are expected to be valid in arbitrary dimensions .",
    "we note that , although the scaling relations to appear below for the super - rough and intrinsic anomalous cases exist already in the literature @xcite , seemingly the independence between the occurrence of anomalous scaling and the value ( larger or smaller than one ) of the global roughness exponent @xmath37 has not been adequately understood so far .",
    "since a clear picture of the different scaling behaviors which can appear is crucial to correctly identify them in experiments and models , we believe a somewhat detailed presentation is in order . it is attempted in section ii .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section iii",
    "we illustrate the conclusions of sec .",
    "ii by an analysis of two growth models formulated in terms of stochastic equations .",
    "even though the two models are exactly solvable , we choose to study them numerically in order to illustrate how our scaling analysis can be applied to more general cases .",
    "the first model examined is the linear mbe equation , known to display anomalous scaling due to super - roughening .",
    "the second model we consider in sec .",
    "iii is the stochastic diffusion equation with random diffusion coefficient studied in @xcite , which exemplifies a case of intrinsic anommalous scaling . finally , we present some conclusions in sec .",
    "iv , and discuss consequences for scaling analysis of rough surfaces in experiments and numerical simulations .",
    "appendix a contains details on the calculations discussed in sec .",
    "in order to study a problem of kinetic roughening the height - height correlation function @xmath39 is frequently used . this correlation function scales in the same way as the square of the local width , @xmath40 , and provides an alternative method to determine the critical exponents .    however , as we will see in the following , a more transparent understanding of the complete dynamic scaling can be obtained by studying the fourier transform of the interface height in a system of linear size @xmath5 ( see _ e.  g. _ @xcite and references therein ) , @xmath41 \\exp(ikx),\\ ] ] where the spatial average of the height has been subtracted . in this representation",
    ", the properties of the surface can be investigated by calculating the structure factor or power spectrum @xmath42 which contains the same information on the system as the height - height correlation function @xmath43 defined in ( [ h - h ] ) , both of them being related by @xcite @xmath44 s(k , t ) \\\\ & \\propto & \\int_{2\\pi /l}^{\\pi / a } { dk \\over 2\\pi } [ 1 - \\cos(kl ) ] s(k , t ) .",

    "( [ sscal],[fvfors ] ) can easily be seen to be equivalent to eqs.([fv - globalwidth ] , [ fv - forf ] ) , by noting that the global width is nothing but the integral of @xmath38 , i.e. @xmath48 where the momentum integral is limited to @xmath49 and represents a continuum aproximation to the sum over the discrete set of modes . in a discrete growth model , @xmath50",
    "is identified with the lattice spacing .",
    "note as well that eq .",
    "( [ fvfors ] ) implies that , for @xmath51 , the spectrum does _ not _ depend on time , and hence at saturation ( @xmath52 ) , @xmath38 is a pure power law independent of system size .",

    "for instance , at saturation @xmath52 , the scaling function in the integrand of eq .",
    "( [ int - of - g ] ) can be substituted for its ( constant ) limiting behavior at large arguments ( see ( [ fvfors ] ) ) , and one is left with @xmath55 , the limits @xmath56 , and @xmath57 having been taken .",
    "analogously one can arrive at the local scaling given by @xmath58 where the scaling function @xmath59 is _ constant _ for @xmath60 and @xmath61 for @xmath62 .",
    "this is the usual situation in which @xmath36 and the local and global roughness exponents are equal ( @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) .      in the case of growth models generating super - rough surfaces ( @xmath26 ) , but with a _ structure factor fulfilling family - vicsek scaling _ , the integrals in ( [ int - of - g ]",
    ") are divergent in the limit @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) for @xmath57 , given the strong singularity at the origin of integration @xcite . taking the limit @xmath65 first for fixed @xmath50 , @xmath5 ( see appendix ) , one obtains @xmath67 so that @xmath68 and @xmath30 . in the early time regime @xmath69 , @xmath70 .",
    "as has been remarked in refs.@xcite , the fact that @xmath21 can not exceed 1 for super - rough surfaces ( @xmath26 ) is a purely geometric property which follows from definition ( [ h - h ] ) .",
    "apart from the super - roughening case , there is another important situation which leads to anomalous scaling . in some growth models",
    "an example of which is discussed in sec .",
    "iii , _ the structure factor _ may present an unconventional scaling not described by family - vicsek ( [ fvfors ] ) .",
    "let us consider a dynamic scaling form for @xmath38 as in eq.([sscal ] ) but with the scaling function @xmath71 replaced by @xmath72 where the label @xmath73 denotes intrinsic anomalous spectrum . here",
    "@xmath74 is a _ new _ exponent which  measures \" the anomaly in the spectrum . in a system of size @xmath5 , eqs .",
    "( [ sscal ] ) , ( [ anom - s ] ) hold only up to the saturation time @xmath75 , after which the system size @xmath5 replaces the correlation length @xmath76 in all expressions .",
    "thus in particular , at saturation the structure factor depends on the size of the system as @xmath77 . as a consequence ,",
    "the stationary spectrum shows severe finite size effects , to the extent that it is not defined in the thermodinamic limit @xmath78 .    a scaling behavior such as eqs .  ( [ sscal ] ) , ( [ anom - s ] ) for",
    "the structure factor does not affect the behavior of the _ global _ width , which preserves its family - vicsek form , @xmath79 for @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "on the contrary , the _ local _ properties of the surface change dramatically if @xmath38 scales as in ( [ anom - s ] ) . that can be seen by computing the height - height correlation function from eq .",
    "( [ g - from - s ] ) , @xmath82 \\ ; \\frac{s_{a}(\\rho u)}{u^{2\\chi + 1 } } \\ ; du\\ ] ] which as before ( and see appendix ) gives @xmath83 for times @xmath84 . however , for intermediate times @xmath27 ( @xmath66 ) the integral ( [ local - a ] ) picks up a non - trivial contribution from the behavior of @xmath85 at large arguments , so that @xmath86 thus , the complete scaling of the height difference correlation function ( or , equivalently , the square of the local width ) can be written as @xmath87 where the local roughness exponent is @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and the scaling function @xmath90 is _ not _ constant anymore for small arguments , but behaves as @xmath91 the fact that @xmath92 in eq .",
    "( [ anom - s ] ) yields a local roughness exponent @xmath93 and an anomalous growth exponent @xmath94 .",
    "therefore , there are now _ three _ independent exponents describing the scaling properties of the surface , whereas for family - vicsek scaling ( even in the presence of super - roughening ) there are only two .",
    "which triplet of independent exponents one considers depends mainly on the kind of scaling properties one is measuring . in experiments normally it is local properties of the surface ( local width , etc . ) that are measured , and one might naturally consider as independent exponents _",
    "@xmath21 , @xmath13 , and @xmath28 . on the other hand ,",
    "the focus of numerical simulations are usually finite size effects , thus probing global properties of the surface such as the global width or power spectrum . in the latter cases a common choice is _ e.g. _",
    "@xmath37 , @xmath74 , and @xmath95 .",
    "we should stress that , although the scaling relations for exponents are exactly the same as for the super - roughening case discussed above , the present type of anomalous scaling is due to @xmath92 and may and does occur in growth models with @xmath96 .",
    "the scaling behavior ( [ anom - g ] ) of the local width is formally equivalent to that of super - roughening ( for which case @xmath97 and @xmath30 ) , a fact which has produced some confusion in previous works where both anomalies have been identified in some way .    in view of the local scaling , eq .",
    "( [ anom - g ] ) , the structure factor can be rewritten conveniently as @xmath98 where we can observe two interesting facts that characterize what we call an _ intrinsic anomalous scaling_. first , @xmath99 decays as @xmath100 , and _ not _ following the @xmath101 law characteristic of family - vicsek scaling ( super - roughening case included ) .",
    "second , there is an unconventional dependence of @xmath102 on time which leads to a non stationary structure factor for @xmath103 .",
    "the combination of these two facts allows to distinguish between anomalous scaling due to super - roughening ( @xmath26 ) and intrisic anomalous scaling .",
    "in this section we present numerical simulations of two different growth equations in order to illustrate the theory we have just discussed in the previous section .",
    "first , we discuss the linear mbe equation as a paradigmatic example of family - vicsek behavior of the structure factor , in the presence of super - roughening , leading to anomalous scaling of the height - height correlation function .",
    "second , we study a random diffusion model in which one can tune the values of the global exponents @xmath37 , @xmath95 .",
    "we compare the exact solution of the model with numerical integrations of the equation of motion . by analyzing the structure factor",
    ", we will see that the second model constitutes an excellent example of what we have termed intrinsic anomalous scaling in the previous section , independent of the value of @xmath37 below or above one .",
    "let us start studying the simplest equation relevant for mbe growth @xcite .",
    "for a one dimensional interface it reads @xmath104 where @xmath105 is a white noise with zero mean , and the constant @xmath106 .",
    "exponents can be easily found by dimensional analysis , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , and @xmath109 , thus eq .",
    "( [ lmbe ] ) generates super - rough surfaces .",
    "this equation has been widely studied by many authors ; however for the sake of clarity we wish to sumarize here briefly some numerical results for it that illustrate our scaling analysis in an example of super - roughening .",
    "we have solved numerically eq .",
    "( [ lmbe ] ) by means of a finite differences scheme . to study the structure factor ,",
    "we have calculated @xmath38 in systems of @xmath110 .",
    "[ fig1 ]    in the inset of fig .",
    "1 numerical results are shown for @xmath111 , and 200 realizations of the noise . for @xmath112 ,",
    "the structure factor decays as @xmath113 ( _ i .",
    "e. _ the global roughness exponent @xmath109 ) and does not display any _ anomaly_. in fig .  1 we plot a collapse of the data for the exponents @xmath108 and @xmath114 . as we see , the scaling function of the structure factor indeed has the family - vicsek shape ( [ fvfors ] ) @xcite .",
    "thus there is no anomaly in the behavior of @xmath38 for eq .",
    "( [ lmbe ] ) . however , there is anomalous behavior if we look at the local properties of the surface in real space .",
    "we have calculated the local width , @xmath17 for different _ window _ sizes @xmath32 in a system of total size @xmath115 , and averaged over 15 realizations of the noise .",
    "an inspection of the inset of fig .",
    "2 shows that the local width on length scales @xmath18 does not saturate at times @xmath116 but continues to grow in time as @xmath117 with @xmath118 , in agreement with the theoretical prediction ( [ gsuper ] ) for eq .",
    "( [ lmbe ] ) @xmath119 .",
    "as discussed above , in the presence of anomalous scaling the height - height correlation function ( or the local width ) satisfies a dynamic scaling form , although with a scaling function which differs from the family - vicsek one , see eqs .",
    "( [ fvforg ] ) , ( [ anom - g ] ) , and ( [ ga ] ) .",
    "as stressed in @xcite ( for the height - height correlation function ) , the plot of @xmath120 _ vs. _ @xmath121 allows one to determine the form of the scaling function since @xmath122 the data in the inset of fig .",
    "2 have been collapsed for @xmath123 , and plotted in fig",
    "the scaling function @xmath124 obtained is not constant for @xmath60 , but scales with its argument as @xmath125 , with @xmath34 for this case .",
    "this is consistent with the scaling behaviour ( [ gsuper ] ) , or equivalently with ( [ anom - g ] ) for @xmath34 .      next let us consider the more complex case of intrinsic anomalous scaling .",
    "we focus our attention on a growth model with a random diffusion coefficient governed by the equation @xmath126 the diffusion coefficient @xmath127 is distributed according to the probability density @xmath128 , where the parameter @xmath129 characterizes the intensity of the disorder .",
    "@xmath130 is merely a normalization constant and the cutoff function is @xmath131 for @xmath132 and @xmath133 for @xmath134 .",
    "if @xmath135 , disorder in the diffusion coefficient does not play any role and the edwards - wilkinson @xcite exponents @xmath136 , @xmath137 are recovered .",
    "thus the disorder is termed _",
    "weak_. on the contrary , for _ strong _ disorder , @xmath138 , the critical exponents @xmath139 are disorder - dependent ( through the value of @xmath129 ) .",
    "there are two major features that make this model interesting . on one hand , it is linear and can be solved exactly @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "exponents are dependent on the parameter @xmath129 in a known way .",
    "in particular , the global roughness exponent @xmath37 takes a continuous range of values from @xmath140 to @xmath141 when varying the intensity of disorder from @xmath142 to @xmath143 . in ref.@xcite",
    "it has been found that the random diffusion model always exhibits anomalous scaling for @xmath144 .",
    "hence anomalous scaling in this model occurs for surfaces with roughness exponent @xmath145 _ as well as _ for those with @xmath146 .",
    "therefore , this model constitutes an excellent example of anomalous scaling not due to super - roughening .    as stated above , the analytical study of ( [ columnar ] ) allows to determine exactly the critical exponents ( see @xcite ) . for the region of interest here , @xmath147 , one has @xmath148 it is a curious property of model ( [ columnar ] ) that @xmath21 remains constant when changing the intensity of the disorder , in contrast to the wide range of variation existing in @xmath37 .",
    "this is a feature also found for many models of rough epitaxial growth @xcite . in sec .",
    "ii we have demonstrated that in the case of anomalous kinetic roughening the time exponent @xmath28 is always given by the scaling relation @xmath149 .",
    "thus , from ( [ exp ] ) , @xmath28 depends on @xmath129 as @xmath150 for a given disorder parameter @xmath129 .",
    "we have performed simulations of the discretized version of eq .",
    "( [ columnar ] ) in a system of lateral size @xmath115 for different degrees of disorder in the strong disorder phase , @xmath147 . in fig .",
    "3 we plot @xmath17 for two values of @xmath129 . for @xmath151 , the exact global roughness exponent is larger than one , @xmath114 , and one observes in the upper panel of fig .  3 that the scaling behaviour of the local width is anomalous with @xmath152 in agreement with the theoretical value @xmath153 .    in the case of a disorder parameter @xmath154 ( see lower panel of fig .",

    ", the scaling function behaves as expected for anomalous scaling , and has an analogous shape to that found for the local width in the super - rough case .",

    "the spectrum decays as @xmath100 ( not as @xmath101 ) and is clearly shifted for different times .",
    "this scaling behaviour is the one in eq .",
    "( [ scaling - s ] ) , which we associated in sec .",
    "ii.b with that of growth models having an intrisic anomaly .",
    "this can be better appreciated when collapsing the curves of fig .  5 as shown in fig .  6 , which displays the @xmath38 data collapses for @xmath164 , and yields a scaling function @xmath165 with a form consistent with eq .  ( [ anom - s ] ) , and not with the family - vicsek form , eq .",

    "as we have seen in the previous sections , one of the main conclusions of the present work is that anomalous scaling of rough surfaces is a more general ( and independent ) phenomenon than those cases associated with super - roughening . in this sense",
    "several issues associated with anomalus scaling remain to be clarified .",
    "one of them is its relation and/or interplay with the phenomena of multifractality and intermitency , known to take place in the super - rough case @xcite .",
    "moreover , we have seen that the intrinsic anomalous surfaces display a novel type of spectrum thus far not considered for self - affine geometries , which are usually defined as to have a family - vicsek spectrum @xcite .",
    "an outstanding issue in this regard is to clarify the physical meaning of the exponent @xmath74 , as well as extending the currently available renormalization group techniques to be able to calculate the value of this exponent . on the phenomenological side ,",
    "when performing experiments or interpreting numerical simulations of discrete growth models , we believe the existence of intrinsic anomalous scaling is a very relevant issue . on one hand , in the presence of intrinsic anomalous scaling",
    "the various correlation functions behave somewhat similarly to the family - vicsek case . however , indeed there are important differences . for instance , @xmath38 _ scales _ as @xmath169 , and _ not _ as @xmath101 , the graphs of @xmath17 and @xmath38 are shifted for different times , etc .",

    "we believe this has not always been done when analyzing data from experiments and/or numerical simulations , and may have added to certain confusion existing in the literature in the identification of universality classes",
    ". moreover , the intermediate time regime existing in surfaces with anomalous scaling introduces difficulties in the evaluation of exponents through the common use of local measurements such as the local width , frequently employed in experiments and numerical simulations .",
