    "we can get basic information about nuclear matter from semiempirical mass formulas .",
    "one such fomula , known as the liquid drop model ( ldm ) , determines the binding energy(@xmath6 ) of nuclei in terms of a nuclear matter contribution and various corrections for finite nuclei@xcite : @xmath7 where @xmath8mev , @xmath9mev , @xmath10mev , @xmath11mev , @xmath12 is the number of neutrons , @xmath13 is the number of protons , and a is the total number of nucleons in a nucleus@xcite . first is the volume term , which is the binding energy of infinite nuclear matter .",
    "the second term indicates the reduction of binding due to the nucleons on the surface .",
    "the third term represents the coulomb energy , which is assumed to be that of uniformly - distributed charge .",
    "the last term is the symmetry energy , representing the decrease in binding energy for unequal numbers of protons and neutrons .",

    "baym , pethick , and sutherland@xcite extended the previous model in the regime from @xmath18g/@xmath15 to neutron drip and applied it to neutron stars and white dwarfs .",
    "+ oyamatsu@xcite studied nuclear shapes and lattice types ( spherical , cylindrical , slab , cylindricl hole and spherical hole nuclei ) at t = 0 mev with parametrized neutron and proton distributions , and performed the thomas - fermi calculations with four different energy - density functionals .",
    "negele and vautherin@xcite used a different method ( hartree - fock approximation ) to study the equation of state at t = 0 mev .",
    "they were able to get a density - dependent hamiltonian from two - body interactions and found results similar to bbp .",

    "the llpr eos is based on the ldm .",
    "they included the effect of temperature on nuclei , the increase of surface energy as temperature increases , the effect of external nucleons , and the effect of nuclear excited states .",
