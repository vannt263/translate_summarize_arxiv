    "day length and temperature are two of the most important driving factors for life on earth and for human culture . while evidently strongly coupled , their relationship is not a simple one in detail .    due to",
    "the regularity of celestial and planetary motion and the relative ease with which sun position can be recorded , the solstices and equinoxes have been determined and commemorated by cultures around the world for thousands of years ( e.g. , stonehenge ) , long before being scientifically understood .",
    "we thus know with great precision when the longest and shortest day of the year will be , but what about the on - average hottest and coldest days ?",
    "temperature behaves stochastically with highs and lows on a specific date potentially differing greatly relative to surrounding dates and across years .",
    "compounding temperature s unevenness is that reliable measurement has only been realized in the last few hundred years . indeed ,",
    "widespread , systematic recording in the united states , which we study here , only began in the late 1800s .",
    "we are only now in a position to capitalize on sufficiently large data sets to give a reasonably solid answer to our question .",
    "we propose to call the dates of on - average extreme temperature the _ teletherms _ , using the greek roots _ tele _ for distant and _ therm _ for heat .",
    "this construction is patterned after the latin origin of solstice with _",
    "sol _ for sun and _ stit _ for stationary .",
    "as we will find , the teletherms and their temperatures are not fixed but vary in both space and time .",
    "in particular , we will show that across the united states , the dynamics of the teletherms are locally coherent but overall highly variable , revealing intricate patterns including bifurcations in dates and both warming and cooling . for many regions , we will also demonstrate that the teletherm is more appropriately acknowledged as occurring over a range of dates rather than a single one .",
    "we will therefore also speak both of each location s single day teletherm and its _ teletherm period _ which we define below in a pragmatic fashion .",
    "our conception of the teletherm is related to but differs from existing meteorological quantities drawn from stations around the united states .",
    "the national oceanic and atmospheric administration ( noaa ) captures ` climate normals ' : 30 year averages at day , month , season , and year resolutions for a range of quantities including mean , maximum , and minimum temperatures ; precipitation ; and snowfall  @xcite .",
    "climate normals are made available to and used broadly by the public .",
    "for example , monthly averages are of great use to people traveling to new areas .",
    "noaa and the national weather service provide the local climate analysis tool ( lcat ) at http://nws.weather.gov/lcat/home for people to explore historical and recent climate dynamics . as we explain below",
    ", we estimate the teletherms aspects  date , temperature , extent , and period  from a daily maximum and minimum temperature data set , and as such our contribution can be seen as building a new lens for the united states rich meteorological data set .",
    "we accompany our paper with an interactive site at http://panometer.org/instruments/teletherms to enable those interested to examine climate dynamics through the teletherms .",
    "if the notion of the teletherm becomes standard , we would hope a version of this site might eventually be incorporated into the lcat .    despite the evident imperative of quantifying climate change ,",
    "the task has proven to be both scientifically complex  @xcite and politically fraught and controversial  @xcite .",
    "tied as they are to the changing of the seasons  @xcite , teletherm dynamics matter for ecological stability , agriculture , the earth s water cycle , the livability of cities  @xcite , and cultural and religious observances .    by formalizing these annual turning points in temperature",
    "we hope to help advance our collective understanding of and ability to discern climate change . while we will make a number of general observations regarding teletherm dynamics , the central objective of our present work is the introduction of a statistically sound quantification of these two fundamental aspects of the annual climate cycle , with the hope of both expanding and challenging future work on climate dynamics .",
    "we structure our paper as follows .",
    "we first make some basic observations about the historical weather data set which we build our analysis around , along with a few details about our approach .",
    "we then present our main findings , describing and testing our approach to determining teletherms and teletherm periods at specific locations , highlighting a few of the extreme locations such as the hottest summer teletherm and coldest winter teletherm . moving out from individual stations ,",
    "we then examine a range of results for the contiguous united states .",
    "we first show that the winter and summer teletherms vary strongly according to geographic location .",
    "we then explore the temporal dynamics of regional teletherms , and discuss their relationship to climate change .",
    "finally , we compare empirical teletherm dates with those produced by two regional climate models ( rcms ) .",
    "to close , we put forward a few concluding remarks , contemplating future directions .",
    "we provide a complete set of figures and code as part of the paper s online appendices at http://compstorylab.org/share/papers/dodds2015c .",
    "we consider daily records of maximum and minimum temperatures for 1218 stations distributed across the contiguous united states for the time period 18532012 .",
    "we draw on the united states historical climatology network ( uschn ) data set ( version 2.5 through 2012 )  @xcite .",
    "each station is identified with a u.s .",
    "cooperative observer network station identification code which we will denote as station i d .    the scatter plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : teletherm_map002 ] , along with all maps that follow , demonstrate that the geographic coverage afforded by the stations is fairly uniform with some minor clustering around populous areas .",
    "the temperature records in our data set are not , however , temporally uniform .",
    "stations have different lifespans  the oldest starting in 1853 ( camden 3 w , south carolina ; station i d : 381310 ) and the youngest in 1998 ( md sci ctr baltimore , maryland ; station i d : 185718 ) .",
    "some stations have gaps in their records , a complication which we will deal with as needed in our various analyses .",
    "for example , yellowstone park in mammoth , wyoming ( station i d : 489905 ) has records for 18941903 and 19412012 , missing a period of 37 years .",
    "we will also ignore any datum for which a potential source of error is indicated .",
    "in our analyses , we will use overall day number of the year for maximum temperature starting at january 1 . for the minimum temperature",
    ", we wrap the calendar and consider days counting forwards from july 1 and running through to june 30 in the following year , thereby roughly centering the low point to better accommodate statistical treatment . to present our results ,",
    "we presume a 365 day year meaning an adjustment of a day will be needed for a leap year .    finally , to create a reference tying the teletherms to the solar cycle",
    ", we standardize the summer and winter solstices as falling on june 21 and december 21 ( day numbers 172 and 355 ) .",
    "our goal is to identify the teletherms and teletherm periods and their respective dynamics in as straightforward a fashion as possible . because of the stochasticity of temperature , our analysis necessarily involves several steps .",
    "we first compute the mean maximum and minimum temperature for each day of the year at each station .",
    "we average over all error - free data points , acknowledging the variability of both length and completeness of each station s temperature time series . in the following section on teletherm maps , we will only include averages for stations for which we have data for at least 80% of the dates within a given window .",
    "to enable us to illustrate and explain our treatment in full , we will use a selection of six extreme teletherm locations in the contiguous u.s . in figs .",

    "[ fig : teletherm_tmax_station007_extremes001]b , the period of record begins before 1900 but shows an imperfect collection rate ; we generally see that winter temperatures , especially minima , are ( unsurprisingly ) more error prone .",

    "we use daily temperature extremes from both model systems at all 1218 station locations to compute summer and winter teletherms for the time periods covered by the models : 1968 to 1999 ( ccsm ) and 1979 to 2004 ( ncep ) ( see  @xcite for related work on climate models ) .    using our historical data set",
    ", we also determined the teletherms for these same time periods .",
    "we then found the difference between the models teletherms and the measured teletherms at each location , and we show the histogram of these differences in fig .  [",
    "fig : modelerrordist ] . in these plots ,",
    "a positive difference means a model s teletherm occurs later in the year than the teletherm we estimated based on real data .    for both models and for both winter and summer teletherms , we see evidence of characteristic , irregular kinds of errors . for the ccsm , the single peak in fig .",
    "[ fig : modelerrordist]a shows that the model produces summer teletherms that occur 10 to 20 days later in the year than those observed . for the winter teletherm ,",
    "two peaks reflect regional systematic errors .",
    "the ncep model fares somewhat better with a peak around a difference of 0 for both teletherms , though a second peak of similar size indicates a prediction of earlier teletherms for a commensurate swathe of stations .",
    "we find the average absolute error in estimating the summer and winter teletherm are 12.88 and 10.05 days for the ccsm , and 12.24 and 7.57 days for the ncep model .",
    "spearman correlations are mixed with a best value of 0.85 for the ccsm s winter teletherm ( @xmath17-value effectively 0 ) and a worst case of 0.059 for ccsm s summer teletherm ( @xmath17-value 0.039 ) . at the level of stations ,",
    "the worst errors for both models are for the summer teletherm with spans 78 and 59 days too early and 44 and 48 too late for the ccsm and the ncep model respectively .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : modelerrordist_daily ] , we step back from teletherms , and plot the distribution of errors at the day level between the output of both models and measured maximum and minimum temperatures .",
    "this is an exacting test : how does a model fair with predicting the maximum temperature , say , in death valley on march 3 , 1982 , along with all other stations and all other dates over several decades ?",
    "with approximately 10,000 points per panel , we see a much smoother distribution and the form is now gaussian - like .",
    "we find that the spearman correlations between the models outputs and measured daily temperature extremes are good , ranging from 0.796 ( ccsm , daily minimum temperature ) to 0.875 ( ncep , daily maximum temperature ) ( @xmath17-values effectively 0 ) .",
    "the ncep model is on average more accurate with an average difference for the daily minimum of @xmath18 .",
    "the average absolute error varies from 7.32 ( ncep , daily minimum temperature ) to 12.1 ( ccsm , daily maximum temperature ) .",
    "the potential for wild inaccuracies remain with ccsm s worst prediction being @xmath19 below the real measurement of a minimum temperature .    in testing these climate models for teletherm timing and daily temperature extremes",
    ", we are certainly asking for more than they have been intended to deliver . indeed ,",
    "if these models were integrating in numerical weather prediction mode , with initial values updated through data assimilation , the errors would be much smaller . nevertheless ,",
    "understanding the successes and limitations of any model , whether aimed for or not , should be of benefit to future refinements  @xcite .",
    "we were initially motivated by the simple question of when should we expect the on - average warmest and coldest day of the year to occur at a given location . in the northeast of the u.s .",
    "for example , the winter solstice passes and as the days lengthen , the cold deepens and people begin to wonder when will the winter end . traditionally , prognosticators have used diverse methods to divine the length of winter such as , famously , how certain species of rodents react to their umbra . and in general , people look for signs of all the seasons arriving such as the emergence of daffodils in spring or the first leaves turning to their autumnal colors .",
    "we realized however that a data - driven , less poetic path could be assayed .    while the analysis promised to be initially straightforward ( as is often believed to be the case ) , we soon found that we had to move beyond a single day version of the teletherm to a teletherm period .",
    "overall , we believe we have shown the spatiotemporal variability of the teletherms and the surrounding teletherm periods to be considerable , informative , and of general interest .",
    "importantly , we have seen that the variations in teletherm characteristics are not a reflection of random noise but rather linear movements , periods of stasis , and switching reminiscent of bifurcations in dynamical systems .",
    "teletherms seem therefore to present a real facet of climate change , whatever the origin .",
    "a number of future directions are possible . where data is available , our analysis could readily be carried out for other regions around the world . beyond local interest ,",
    "such efforts could lead to an effort to patch together a global picture of the teletherms .",
    "online displays of teletherms could also eventually include the ability to adjust time frames for the analysis and to show the likelihood that the warmest or coldest day has occurred as a function of day of the year",
    ". a global map would also afford more opportunities to test models and hypotheses regarding climate dynamics .",
    "for example , does the temporal behavior of teletherms correlate in an way to changes or stationarity of average annual temperature ?",
    "the stochastic nature of temperature could also be of value in our collective general education regarding prediction for noisy systems .",
