    "as more flux comes in , there arises an island of li - rich phase in the middle of the li - poor phase .",
    "this can be explained by the dynamics of diffusion and reaction , where the whole system is perturbed strongly and it is easy to achieve a phase segregation once the magnitude of fluctuation is large enough . as for the reaction , by comparing the concentration profile and the reaction rate , one can observe that the reaction peaks at the interface front , where the concentration gradient is very high . in the two homogeneous phases ,",
    "the reaction is relatively slow , especially in the li - rich phase , where the reaction almost stops .",
    "this low efficiency of reaction in the li - rich phase explains again why the core - shell structure is lithiated much slower than the other , studied in the last subsection .",
    "figure  [ fig : ani_sp ] shows the case of an anisotropic diffusion .",
    "as explained in the section [ subsec : fm_freeenergydensity ] , the interfacial parameter is chosen in such a way that @xmath206 . in the simulation , the diffusion in x direction",
    "is set to be slowest .",
    "note that even though diffusivity in y , z direction is the same , in z - direction lithium sites are filled faster than in y - direction .",
    "this is due to the fact that the dimension in z - direction is smaller than that in y - direction .",
    "in contrast to the isotropic case , phase segregation initiates from the two ends although the reaction takes place in all six sides of x axis .",
    "as time goes on , the phase interface marches towards the center .",
    "a third li - rich phase appears in the middle when soc is approximately @xmath207 , thus the formation of stripes appears .",
    "this result supports the domino - cascade model of lifepo@xmath0 , which was proposed in the work of delma et al .",
    "@xcite    these two cases are extreme . however , with proper implementation of crystal anisotropy , by filling the diffusion matrix also in the off - diagonal entries , one can also achieve a core - shell structure with a polygon core , as observed in the work of liu et al .",

    "as final example , we simulate an infinitely long cylinder with two initial parallel longitudinal cracks on its exterior . the problem is illustrated in figure  [ fig : disc_model ] , and the corresponding parameters are given in table  [ tb : parameter_disc ] .",
    "the electrode / electrolyte voltage drop is given such that li is extracted from the cylinder .",
    "the reaction only takes place on the cylindrical surface and the crack surface . as it is explained in section  [ subsec : ecr_cracksurface ] , the reaction on the crack surface is approximated by the weighted source in the phase - field theory . in order to reach the diffusive profile for the initial crack ,",

    "as the outer layer loses more lithium , a two - phase profile appears . it should be noted that at the crack tip lithium can be supplied quickly from the unbroken material .",
    "in fact , due to the large tensile stresses at the crack tip , the drift effect of the mechanical field towards the crack tip becomes prominent .",
    "this effect can be seen more clearly in figure  [ fig : disc_crack](c ) , where the phase interface on the crack surface is far behind that in the other part of the material .    on the other hand , due to the loss of lithium",
    ", the outer layer turns to shrink . because of this mismatch with the interior li - rich phase ,",
    "tensile circumferential stresses arise in the outer layer , which drives the crack to propagate . at the first stage ,",
    "the crack propagates faster than the interface .",
    "it then slows down , until the phase interface runs over the crack tip .",
    "after the phase interface leaves the crack , the propagation of crack turns to stop , due to the decrease of the driving force .",
    "however , the phase interface continues to move .",
    "the li - rich phase gradually reforms into a circular . at the end of the simulation ,",
    "the whole material is almost fully delithiated , and the reaction stops .",

    "[ fig : disc_crack_reac ] . at this state , on the crack surface both phases and phase interface are exposed to the electrolyte . by comparing these two plots",
    ", it can be seen that near the crack surface , the reaction peaks in the neighborhood of the interface and gradually diffuses into the bulk . in the li - poor region ,",
    "the reaction almost vanishes , while towards the crack tip the reaction is rather strong .",
    "in this paper , the electrochemical reaction in the lithium ion batteries is studied by using phase - field modeling of fracture coupled with anisotropic cahn - hilliard - type diffusion in the large deformation regime .",
    "the reaction on the surface is modeled through a modified butler - volmer equation , taking into account the influence of phase separation on the surface .",
    "the reaction on the crack surface is considered as a source term within the volume weighted by a damage - variable - related term to constrain the reaction to take place only on the transition zone between the unbroken and broken state .",
    "three examples are carried out to study different aspects .",
    "the first example of an isotropic sphere shows that the ratio of the timescale of the reaction and diffusion greatly influences the phase segregation of the material : a fast reaction gives a `` shrinking core '' while a slow reaction has the nucleation initiated already from the surface . in turn",
    ", the phase segregation also influences the real reaction rate through the electrochemical potential on the surface . when a core - shell structure is formed , the highly homogeneous concentration on the surface prevents the lithium from further inserting into the particle .",
    "however , an uneven distribution of the concentration , although accompanied by a highly distorted surface , can give a much more robust reaction in the long run .",
    "in the second example , the reaction on the interface of two phases in an isotropic diffusion and anisotropic diffusion is studied .",
    "results show that , both in isotropic and anisotropic cases , the reaction rate peaks near the interface , where there exists a large concentration gradient . the last example shows the reaction on the crack surface .",
    "it is shown that the crack evolution can be driven by a outflow of the species when the material exhibits a phase segregation behavior .",
    "the electrochemical reaction on the newly created crack surfaces has been discussed , along with the interaction between the crack propagation and the phase segregation process .",

    "<S> to study the electrochemical reaction on surfaces , phase interfaces , and crack surfaces in the lithium ion battery electrode particles , a phase - field model is developed , which describes fracture in large strains and anisotropic cahn - hilliard - reaction . </S>",
    "<S> thereby the concentration - dependency of the elastic properties and the anisotropy of diffusivity are also considered . the implementation in 3d </S>",
    "<S> is carried out by isogeometric finite element methods in order to treat the high order terms in a straightforward sense . </S>",
    "<S> the electrochemical reaction is modeled through a modified butler - volmer equation to account for the influence of the phase change on the reaction on exterior surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> the reaction on the crack surfaces is considered through a volume source term weighted by a term related to the fracture order parameter . based on the model , </S>",
    "<S> three characteristic examples are considered to reveal the electrochemical reactions on particle surfaces , phase interfaces , and crack surfaces , as well as their influence on the particle material behavior . </S>",
    "<S> results show that the ratio between the timescale of reaction and the diffusion can have a significant influence on phase segregation behavior , as well as the anisotropy of diffusivity . in turn </S>",
    "<S> , the distribution of the lithium concentration greatly influences the reaction on the surface , especially when the phase interfaces appear on exterior surfaces or crack surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> the reaction rate increases considerably at phase interfaces , due to the large lithium concentration gradient . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , simulations demonstrate that the segregation of a li - rich and a li - poor phase during delithiation can drive the cracks to propagate . </S>",
    "<S> results indicate that the model can capture the electrochemical reaction on the freshly cracked surfaces .    </S>",
