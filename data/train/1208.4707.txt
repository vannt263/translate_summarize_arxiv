    "in part i of the present work @xcite we have presented the theoretical foundations of finite temperature reduced density matrix functional theory ( ft - rdmft ) .",
    "ft - rdmft and its zero temperature counterpart employ the one - reduced density matrix ( 1rdm ) rather than the density as central variable and are therefore also suitable for the description of systems subject to nonlocal external potentials .",
    "furthermore , the availability of the eigenvalues and eigenstates of the 1rdm , which are many - particle objects in contrast to the kohn - sham energies and states , opens up the possibility to describe phenomena that are difficult to access by dft @xcite .",
    "one prominent example are mott insulators @xcite which also establish the need for a finite temperature version of rdmft .    in view of the extraordinary success of the lda in the context of dft , it seems desirable to pursue a similar approach in the context of ft - rdmft .",
    "if one considers only local external potentials then there exists a big variety of methods to calculate the equilibrium properties of the homogeneous electron gas ( heg ) at either zero @xcite or finite temperatures @xcite .",
    "however , for an lda in ft - rdmft one needs the equilibrium free energy of the heg subject to arbitrary nonlocal external potentials .",
    "these could in principle be calculated by monte - carlo calculations which , to our knowledge , have not been carried out so far .",
    "accordingly , for setting up an lda in ft - rdmft , one needs to work with functionals that are approximate even for the heg .",
    "part ii of this series @xcite has therefore investigated the first - order functional of ft - rdmft when applied to the heg and it was shown that it was capable of reproducing a qualitatively acceptable phase diagram including collinear as well as spiral spin configurations .",
    "the resulting critical densities , however , where far too large which emphasizes the need for approximate correlation - energy functionals in ft - rdmft .",
    "the main goal of this third part of our work is the investigation of correlation functionals in ft - rdmft when applied to the heg .",
    "this will be done as follows .",
    "firstly we will review the most relevant concepts of ft - rdmft , discussing the possiblity of the formulation of a functional analoguous to the lda .",
    "secondly we will use monte - carlo results to investigate the relation between correlation induced by electrons of the same spin compared to correlation resulting from the interaction of electrons with different spins .",
    "these results will rule out the most common class of approximations in unpolarized rdmft as candidates for an accurate description of spin polarized systems and they will be used to guide the development of improved functionals .",
    "thirdly , we will resort to the zero temperature situation and propose a functional which for the first time not only reproduces the correlation - energy of the heg over a wide range of densities but also describes the momentum distribution qualitatively correctly .",
    "finally , we will use the perturbative methodology as presented in @xcite to derive a truly temperature dependent correlation functional in ft - rdmft .",
    "we will now briefly review the most important concepts of ft - rdmft @xcite .",
    "a general quantum mechanical ensemble is described by its statistical density operator ( sdo ) @xmath0 , which is a weighted sum of projection operators on the underlying hilbert space : @xmath1 the corresponding 1-reduced density matrix ( 1rdm ) is defined as the spatial contraction of all but one dimensions of @xmath0 @xmath2 where the density @xmath3 is determined via @xmath4 . as the 1rdm , by construction , is hermitian we can write it in spectral representation as @xmath5 where the eigenvalues @xmath6 are usually called occupation numbers ( ons ) and the eigenstates @xmath7 are called natural orbitals ( nos ) @xcite .",
    "we have shown in @xcite that the grand potential of an arbitrary system with possibly nonlocal external potential in grand canonical equilibrium ( eq ) is uniquely determined by the corresponding eq-1rdm .",
    "the grand potential @xmath8 of a system with 1rdm @xmath9 can therefore be written as a functional with a universal part @xmath10 $ ] , which is independent of the external potential of the system , and a part @xmath11 $ ] which just depends on this external influence .",

    "the universal functional @xmath10 $ ] on the other hand is defined as @xmath15&=\\min_{\\hat d\\rightarrow\\gamma}\\left({\\textup{tr}\\{\\hat d(\\hat t+\\hat w-1/\\beta\\ln\\hat d)\\}}\\right)\\label{eq.f_univ}\\\\    & = \\omega_k[\\gamma]-1/\\beta s_0[\\gamma]+\\omega_h[\\gamma]+\\omega_x[\\gamma]+\\omega_c[\\gamma]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 describes the coupling to the energy bath with @xmath17 and @xmath18 being boltzmann s constant and the temperature respectively .",
    "the different functionals for the kinetic contribution @xmath19 $ ] , the hartree and exchange contributions @xmath20,\\omega_x[\\gamma]$ ] and the noninteracting entropy part @xmath21 $ ] are explicit functionals of the 1rdm and are given as @xmath22&=\\int d{\\textbf{r}}\\lim_{{\\textbf{r}}\\rightarrow{\\textbf{r}}'}\\left(-\\frac{\\nabla^2}{2}\\right)\\gamma({\\textbf{r}},{\\textbf{r}}')\\\\    \\omega_{h}[\\gamma]&=\\frac12\\int d{\\textbf{r}}d{\\textbf{r}}'w({\\textbf{r}}',{\\textbf{r}})\\gamma({\\textbf{r}}',{\\textbf{r}}')\\gamma({\\textbf{r}},{\\textbf{r}})\\\\    \\omega_{x}[\\gamma]&=-\\frac12\\int d{\\textbf{r}}d{\\textbf{r}}'w({\\textbf{r}}',{\\textbf{r}})\\gamma({\\textbf{r}},{\\textbf{r}}')\\gamma({\\textbf{r}}',{\\textbf{r}})\\label{eq.rdmft.ex}\\\\    s_0[\\gamma]&=-\\sum_i\\left(n_i\\ln(n_i)+(1-n_i)\\ln(1-n_i)\\right)\\label{eq.rdmft.ent}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] accordingly , one only has to approximate the remaining correlation functional @xmath23 $ ] . as the nonlocal nature of the 1rdm allows an exact description of the kinetic energy the correlation functional only contains contributions from the interaction and the entropy which",
    "is expected to simplify the construction of approximate functionals .",
    "the construction of the kohn - sham ( ks ) system in ft - rdmft was shown to be particulary simple .",
    "the no form the eigenstates of the ks hamiltonian and the eigenenergies are found by an inversion of the fermi - dirac relation : @xmath24    with these findings we have all necessary tools at hand to describe the thermodynamic variables of a quantum system in grand canonical equilibrium .",
    "there are , however , physical problems which require the formulation in terms of a canonical ensemble , e.g. the question of the equilibrium magnetic moment of a solid . in this situation the number of electrons is fixed and the equilibrium is realized by the state of minimal free energy @xmath25 rather than minimal grand potential .",
    "as already mentioned in part i of this work @xcite the hohenberg - kohn theorem for canonical ensembles follows exactly the same steps as for the grand canonical ensemble with the only difference that the external potential is uniquely determined by the 1rdm only up to an additional constant .",
    "just as in the grand canonical case the free energy functional @xmath26 $ ] can be seperated in a universal part @xmath27 $ ] and an external part @xmath28 $ ] where the universal part is defined as in eq .",
    "( [ eq.f_univ ] ) but the sdos are now only defined on the @xmath29-particle hilbert space .",
    "the external part is defined as in eq .",
    "( [ eq.gp._ext ] ) , but without the chemical potential contribution .",
    "if we now assume our system to be in the thermodynamic limit , the functional for the free energy is simply related to the grand potential functional via @xmath30&=\\omega[\\gamma]+\\mu n[\\gamma].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is due to the fact that in the thermodynamic limit the energy and entropy are identical for both canonical and grand canonical ensembles and therefore the universal functionals @xmath27 $ ] and @xmath10 $ ] coincide . the external functional describes a one - particle contribution and therefore only depends on the 1rdm , regardless of the ensemble under investigation .    after these considerations we can find the eq - free energy @xmath31 of a certain phase by a minimization of @xmath26 $ ] .",
    "@xmath32\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the domain of minimization is given by the set of all ensemble - n - representable 1rdms , i.e. 1rdms whose ons fulfill @xmath33 with a fixed particle number @xmath29 .",
    "further details of the numerical treatment of ft - rdmft for the heg can be found in @xcite .",
    "we have shown in part ii of this work @xcite , that the method of ft - rdmft constitutes an efficient tool for the description of the equilibrium - properties of the heg at finite temperature in ft - hf approximation .",
    "eventually , however , we would like to be able to describe correlation in spatially nonuniform systems , a task we will deal with in the following .",
    "motivated by the big success of the lda and lsda in dft , the formulation of a local-1rdm - approximation ( lrdma ) in ft - rdmft seems desirable . at this point",
    "it becomes important to point out the conceptual differences between rdmft and dft .      in dft ,",
    "one only has to calculate the correlation - energy of the heg as a function of the constant density @xmath3 . in rdmft , on the other hand",
    ", one has to calculate it for all possible density matrices @xmath34 that are compatible with translational invariance , i.e. for all possible momentum distributions @xmath35 .",
    "the correlation - energy per volume of the heg in rdmft therefore becomes a _",
    "functional _ , @xmath36 $ ] , of @xmath35 rather than just a function of @xmath3 .",
    "under the assumption that such a functional was accessible , the lrdma of rdmft is defined in the following way .",
    "@xmath37&:=\\int d^3 r{\\varepsilon}_c^{heg}[\\gamma({\\textbf{k}},{\\textbf{r}})],\\label{eq.lrdma}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the approximate correlation - energy of a nonuniform system and @xmath39 describes the wigner transform of the 1rdm , @xmath40 this procedure is similar to the definition of the lda in superconducting dft @xcite . while there are many lda constructions conceivable that correctly reduce to the homogeneous limit , eq .",
    "( [ eq.lrdma ] ) is the only definition that correctly reproduces the correlation energy of a _ weakly inhomogeneous",
    "_ electron gas @xcite .",
    "a parametrization of @xmath41 $ ] has not been carried out so far and remains an important task for the future .",
    "an extension of the lrdma fomalism to spin - dependent systems and systems at finite temperature is conceptually straightforward .",
    "however , the explicit calculation of the temperature - dependent @xmath42 $ ] , although in principle possible by means of path integral monte - carlo techniques @xcite , is rather involved , due to the fermionic sign problem @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach for further theoretical development in rdmft and ft - rdmft therefore consists in the derivation of approximate correlation functionals for the heg and their implementation in a ( ft-)lrdma .",
    "we point out that a functional in ft - rdmft should not only reproduce an accurate eq - free energy but also has to yield a good momentum distribution .",
    "the main focus of this work is therefore the presentation and investigation of several choices of correlation functionals in the theoretical framework of ft - rdmft .",
    "one choice which immediately suggests itself is the utilization of correlation functionals from dft , i.e. functionals which just depend on the density @xmath3 , rather than the full 1rdm : @xmath43&=\\omega_c[\\rho].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we would like to point out that this approach exhibits an important intrinsic flaw .",
    "this becomes clear , if one reviews the minimization procedure for the case of local external potentials and seperates the variation over 1rdms in a combined variation over densities and a variation over the class of 1rdms which yield a certain density : @xmath32=\\min_{\\rho}\\min_{\\gamma\\rightarrow \\rho}f[\\gamma]\\\\    & = \\min_{\\rho}\\big(\\omega_{ext}[\\rho]+\\omega_{h}[\\rho]+\\omega_c[\\rho]{\\nonumber}\\\\    & \\hspace*{15mm}+\\min_{\\gamma\\rightarrow \\rho}\\left(\\omega_k[\\gamma]-k_bts_0[\\gamma]+\\omega_x[\\gamma]\\right)\\big).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as we assumed the correlation contribution to be independent of the particular form of the 1rdm as long as the diagonal , i.e. the density , stays the same we can take it out of the minimization over 1rdms .",
    "we find that the minimization over the 1rdms now only contains kinetic , exchange , and entropy contributions .",
    "if the density @xmath3 refers to a solution of the finite temperature hartree - fock equations to some external potential then we have shown in part i of this work @xcite that the constrained minimization of this combination of functionals gives the corresponding hartree - fock momentum distribution .",
    "the resulting 1rdm will in this sense be `` uncorrelated '' .",
    "the severe problem with this result can be understood by considering the zero - temperature limit .",
    "any choice of correlation functional in ft - rdmft which just depends on the density will lead to a step function as the momentum distribution for low temperatures .",
    "is a hartree - fock density of some external potential . in the case of the heg",
    "this is obviously justified but for general systems with nonlocal external potential it is not clear if all densities share this property .",
    "nonetheless the previous considerations show that for a wide class of external potentials , i.e. all which lead to a groundstate density which is the hartree - fock density to some other external potential , the optimal 1rdm will be uncorrelated . ]",
    "this knowledge of the nature of the failure of dft - functionals allows us to , at least partially , take account of these shortcomings and we will be able to study the effect of two representative dft - functionals later on in our investigation of the magnetic phasediagram of the heg in ft - rdmft .",
    "we have seen in @xcite that the first - order functional in ft - rdmft was capable of reproducing a qualitatively resonable phase diagram .",
    "apart from the incorrect momentum distributions the main problem of these results was that the quantum phase transition between unpolarized and polarized configurations is instantaneous at zero temperature which is not correct for a quantum phase transition and that they occur at densities which are far too big ( @xmath44 compared to @xmath45 @xcite ) .",
    "we concluded that the noninteracting entropy functional is capable of describing the most important finite temperature features of the magnetic phase diagram , including a weakening of the ferromagnetic phase and the reproduction of a critical temperature @xmath46 , close to the fermi temperature .",
    "as a first step in the development of correlation functionals in ft - rdmft , it therefore seems desirable to construct a zero temperature correlation functional which yields a critical density close to the expected one and then investigate the temperature dependence induced by the noninteracting entropy functional .",
    "but before we are going to investigate such functionals we will first focus on an important property of the correlation - energy of a spin - polarized heg .",
    "the energy differences between different magnetic phases of the heg become very close for low densities .",
    "an error in the spin - dependence of the correlation - energy might therefore result in a big error in the estimate of the critical density .",
    "therefore , even in monte - carlo calculations , the estimates for the critical wigner - seitz radius @xmath47 , where a quantum phase transition between an unpolarized and totally polarized configuration occurs , vary considerably ( e.g. @xmath48:@xcite compared to @xmath49:@xcite ) .",
    "an approximate functional in rdmft would need to exhibit a very high accuracy to be able to reproduce the quantum phase transition in the heg , which seems to be a very hard problem to solve .",
    "however , most physical systems of interest exhibit much higher densities and therefore the accurate description of the low density quantum phase transition of the heg is rather irrelevant for the application of an lda - type functional to real - world systems .",
    "this serves as an argument that for the implementation in an lda also a medium accuracy in the description of the correlation - energy would suffice . in the following , we will elucidate , why the use of a certain , rather general class of functionals will have severe problems to achieve an even mediocre accuracy in describing spin - polarized systems .",
    "when trying to describe spin - polarized systems in collinear configuration , the kinetic , the external potential , and the exchange part can be seperated into a sum of contributions from only spin - up and only spin - down nos and ons . to describe",
    "the xc functional for a spin - polarized system , a common approach in rdmft is to make the same ansatz of spin - channel seperability .",
    "@xmath50&=e_{xc}[\\gamma_{\\uparrow\\uparrow},\\gamma_{\\downarrow\\downarrow}]=e^s_{xc}[\\gamma_{\\uparrow\\uparrow}]+e^s_{xc}[\\gamma_{\\downarrow\\downarrow}],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the diagonal elements of the 1rdm @xmath9 in spin - space and @xmath53 $ ] denotes the functional which just depends on one spin - component of the 1rdm .",
    "we claim that such an approximation is intrinsically incapable of describing both spin - polarized and spin - unpolarized configurations together .",
    "the underlying reason for this problem is that an additive functional might describe the correlation contributions , which arise from interactions of the electrons of the same spin ( i.e. equal - spin - channel correlation ) , well but will not be able to describe the contribution coming from the correlation of electrons of different spin ( i.e. opposite - spin - channel correlation ) . in the following",
    ", we will elaborate on this problem by considering a spin - polarized heg .",
    "we will again rely on the pwca@xcite parametrization of the polarization - dependent correlation energies .    for a collinear spin configuration ,",
    "the fundamental quantities are the spin - up density @xmath54 and the spin - down density @xmath55 and the energy can be written as @xmath56 .",
    "if the assumption of spin - cannel seperability was valid , the following two relations would hold .",
    "@xmath57 in eq .",
    "( [ eq.rdmft.sep.ef ] ) the partially polarized system is given as a sum of two fully polarized systems , whereas in eq .",

    "the results are shown in figures [ fig.rdmft.sep.deltaf ] and [ fig.rdmft.sep.deltap ] .",

    "decreasing the polarization then leads to a decrease of @xmath64 , i.e. @xmath66 . as in @xmath58 the opposite - spin - channel correlation is neglected , we deduce that it has to be negative . considering the unpolarized case in figure [ fig.rdmft.sep.deltap ] , we see that again by construction @xmath67 vanishes , now for the unpolarized configuration ( @xmath68 ) and then increases with increasing polarization .",
    "this can be understood by realizing that @xmath59 basically double counts the opposite - spin - channel correlation contribution , leading to @xmath69 .    in rdmft ,",
    "the only correlation contribution comes from the interaction alone .",
    "we therefore would like to know , how the opposite - spin - channel correlation contribution relates to this correlation contribution @xmath70 .",
    "we can use the pwca parametrization of the correlation contributions to the energy to calculate @xmath71 and investigate the following two fractions . @xmath72",
    "the results are shown in figures [ fig.rdmft.sep.fracf ] and [ fig.rdmft.sep.fracp ] .",
    "we see that by assuming spin - channel seperability , one will yield errors for the correlation - energy of up to 40% .",
    "however , a remarkable feature of figures [ fig.rdmft.sep.fracf ] and [ fig.rdmft.sep.fracp ] is that the relative deviations over the whole range of considered densities do not vary strongly .",
    "apparently , both equal- as well as opposite - spin - channel correlation are affected in the same way by a change in the density , leading only to a small change in their fraction .",

    "inveigled by the simplicity of the form of the xc approximation and the primary success of the mller functional , gritsenko , pernal and baerends developed what is now known as the bbc1 , bbc2 and bbc3 functionals @xcite .",
    "the key difference in their approach is the different treatment of orbitals which were occupied or unoccupied in a hartree - fock solution ( termed strongly and weakly occupied in the following ) .",
    "in addition , bbc2 and bbc3 effectively mix parts of the exchange and mller functionals .",
    "a very similar approach was taken by piris et al .",
    "their approach differs slightly in the distinction of strongly and weakly occupied orbitals , removes parts of the self interaction ( pnof0 ) and tries to incorporate particle - hole symmetry ( pnof ) .",
    "these more elaborate functionals bbc1/2/3 and pnof/0 are capable of reproducing good dissociation energies as well as correlation energies .",
    "whereas the previous functionals are mainly derived from physical arguments , marques and lathiotakis @xcite pursued a different way by proposing a two - parameter pad form for @xmath76 .",
    "these parameters are then optimized to minimize the deviation of correlation energies when applied to the molecules of the g2 and g2 - 1 sets .",

    "an overview of several of these functionals as well as the corresponding energies for many molecules can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "another rather empirical functional , which will become important in this work , was derived by sharma et al .",
    "they realized that both the exchange - only functionals as well as the mller functional can be seen as instances of a more general functional , namely the @xmath78 or power functional , described by @xmath79 .",
    "as the mller functional underestimates the correlation - energy , one expects to improve the results for values of @xmath78 between 0.5 and 1 .",
    "this assumption proved to be valid @xcite , leading to an accurate description of the dissociation energy curve of h2 ( a discussion of the performance of several dft functionals for this problem can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "these functionals were mainly constructed to describe small finite systems . however , because the correlation functional should be general , they should also work in the case of extended systems like the heg .",

    "three important properties of the momentum distribution derived from these results are listed in the following .    1",
    ".   nonzero occupation of all high momentum states @xcite which can be understood by the help of the electronic cusp condition @xcite .",
    "2 .   a discontinuity and rather symmetrical behaviour of the momentum distribution at the fermi level ( as also suggested by landau - liquid theory ) .",
    "3 .   depletion of low momentum states .",
    "all but one functionals mentioned so far succeed in recovering property ( 1 ) .",

    "the ml / ml - sic functionals exhibit only a very big , but finite , derivative .",
    "therefore , states of very high momentum are not to be expected to show partial occupation . when it comes to the description of property ( 2 ) , only the bbc and the pnof functionals recover a discontinuity at the fermi surface . however , the overall behaviour around the fermi level is not symmetric or qualitatively resembling the monte - carlo results .",
    "furthermore , the size of the discontinuity , created by the bbc functionals , shows a wrong behaviour when changing @xmath82 .",
    "although expected to decrease with decreasing density , it increases @xcite .",
