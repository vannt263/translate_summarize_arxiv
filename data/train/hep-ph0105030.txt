    "`` hard diffraction '' is an experimental phenomenon which lies at the borderline between `` hard '' and `` soft '' interactions .",
    "it appears as a scattering process initiated by a hard probe ( e.g. a virtual photon at hera @xcite or a forward jet at the tevatron @xcite ) , but in which the proton target is not destroyed , in a similar way to conventional soft diffractive processes .",
    "it is associated with large rapidity gaps between the hadronic remnants of the target and of the projectile as was discovered at hera , but was first identified by high-@xmath2 jets in diffraction at the isr @xcite .",
    "there has been a lot of debate about the theoretical explanation of hard diffraction . indeed , assuming a partonic content of the pomeron led to a nice prediction @xcite of the phenomenon and , supplemented by the qcd evolution of diffractive structure functions , to a quantitative description of hera data @xcite . as satisfactory as can be this phenomenological analysis ,",
    "the main unsolved problem in this approach is the lack of relation between diffractive and non diffractive hard scattering leading to a profusion of input parameters ( e.g. the non - perturbative parton distributions in the pomeron ) .",
    "if one wants to enter more deeply in the study of hard diffraction and in the still mysterious nature of the pomeron interaction , one has to look for theoretical links with qcd .",
    "this is our goal .    in the present paper",
    ", we shall focus on three existing different theoretical approaches of hard diffraction , for which we propose a new , unifying , formulation .",
    "the first one we will refer to is the `` partonic pomeron '' approach .",
    "the hard photon is here supposed to probe the parton distributions of the pomeron regge pole considered as a hadronic particle .",
    "in fact we can also consider it as an extension of the regge theory of soft diffraction @xcite to incorporate the effect of the hardness of the probe .    a second approach is the soft colour interaction one , where hard diffraction is described by a two - step process : during a relatively short `` interaction time '' , the probe initiates a typical hard deep - inelastic interaction .",
    "then , at large times / distances , a soft colour interaction is assumed which will decide of the separation between diffractive and non - diffractive events according to a simple probabilistic rule : it gives rise to colour neutralization of the final state with probability of order @xmath3 ( where @xmath4 is the number of colours ) and thus to rapidity gaps and diffraction .",
    "the assumed extreme softness of soft colour interaction ensures that the dynamics of hard partons remains unchanged .",
    "various models based on soft colour interaction @xcite lead to satisfactory phenomenological descriptions .",
    "a third approach is based on the small @xmath0 regime of perturbative qcd , where the resummation of leading @xmath5 contributions allows one to obtain some theoretical information on high energy hard interaction processes following the balitsky , fadin , kuraev , lipatov ( bfkl ) approach @xcite .",
    "calculations of hard diffraction using the related qcd dipole approach @xcite or in the original bfkl framework @xcite have been performed .",
    "in fact , in the line of qcd dipole models for proton structure functions @xcite , models @xcite for diffractive proton structure functions have been derived and give a convenient description of hera data . for further abbreviation",
    "we shall call it the `` qcd dipole '' approach .    keeping a general point of view , one may notice that each of these approaches has advantages and disadvantages with respect to the others .",
    "the partonic pomeron approach synthetises what we know about the effect of the hard probe and the factorization properties of the hard interaction but gives no prediction about the soft pomeron dynamics .",
    "the soft colour interaction approach give a nice relation ( even in normalization ) between hard and soft deep - inelastic scattering but the nature of the colour rearrangement at long distances is unknown .",
    "finally the qcd dipole approach gives detailed prescriptions for the form of the amplitudes , but the problem of the perturbative / non - perturbative qcd interface and the crucial point of the relative normalization of diffractive _ vs _ non - diffractive contributions , remain obscure .",
    "in the present paper we will show that the three aproaches may find a common formulation and intrinsic mutual equivalence through s - matrix relations on different analytic discontinuities of @xmath6 forward elastic amplitudes in the so - called triple - regge regime . within this unifying s - matrix framework and using the hard probe as a hint for the application of perturbative qcd to the calculation of these discontinuities whenever it is reasonably justified",
    ", we will end with a constrained formulation of the diffractive structure functions , transcending the limitations of each of them taken separately .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in the next section we will give the general framework , using both the s - matrix and perturbative qcd properties , allowing one to mutually relate the three abovementionned approaches to hard diffraction .",
    "in the next section 3 , concentrating on the _ inelastic _ component , we show the compatibility of the qcd dipole and partonic pomeron approaches . in section 4 the same is done for the qcd dipole and soft colour interaction approaches . as a result , a determination of the longitudinal and transverse diffractive structure functions emerges incorporating both perturbative and non perturbative ingredients in an overall consistent qcd picture of hard diffraction . in the last section 5 ,",
    "we give a summary of our results , and an outlook on phenomenological tests and theoretical consequences of our unifying approach .",
    "the usual kinematical variables for the diffractive amplitudes and cross - sections are @xmath7 the photon virtuality , @xmath8 the total rapidity available for the final hadronic state , @xmath9 the rapidity gap , @xmath10 where @xmath2 is the momentum transferred at the proton vertex .",
    "we use also @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the invariant mass of the diffractively produced state but due to the sharp cut - off in t , one can often neglect t in the denominator . ] .    in the following",
    "we shall make use of the important s - matrix connection , also called mueller - regge relation @xcite , between semi - inclusive amplitudes and specific discontinuity contributions of forward elastic @xmath6 amplitudes .",
    "it naturally applies to hard diffraction initiated by a virtual photon , as sketched in fig.1 , namely ^ * + pp + x  disc_1\\{^ * |p  p   ^ * |p  p }   .",
    "[ 3to3 ] in fact , this relation , derived in the context of soft physics @xcite , can also be applied to the definition of hard diffraction when @xmath13 and @xmath14 are large enough ( typically , @xmath15 in this case , the mueller - regge relation applies in a region where the pomeron regge poles are supposed to take into account the colour singlet exchange responsible for the gap .",
    "if moreover , the diffractive mass @xmath12 is large enough , one considers a pomeron - like singularity describing the large @xmath12 behaviour .",
    "however the resulting triple - pomeron contribution is to be interpreted here in a loose sense since this third regge singularity may differ from the other ones due to the hard probe , as mentionned in the previous section .",
    "we will thus keep the word pomeron for those responsible for the gaps .    in the triple - regge kinematical region ,",
    "one thus writes @xcite :    ~disc_1 a(3 3 )  g_p(t )   _ ^2   e^2(-1 ) y  ^tot_^*-p  , [ regge ] where @xmath16 is the `` unintegrated '' ( t - dependent ) diffractive structure functions ( related to the measurable hard diffractive cross - sections ) , _ ( t ) ( -(t ) ) \\{1+e^-i(t ) } [ phase ] is the ( partonic ) pomeron regge phase factor in the amplitude and @xmath17 is the ( partonic ) pomeron - pole regge trajectory with intercept @xmath18 and slope @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20 is a function , not constrained in the regge formalism , describing the coupling of incident pomerons to the proton .",
    "the pomeron - photon cross - section @xmath21 describes the interaction of the hard probe with the incident pomeron .",
    "for instance , in the partonic pomeron model @xcite , it is expressed in terms of pomeron structure functions , in much the same way as proton - photon cross - sections are expressed in terms of the proton structure functions , but with a quite different partonic content @xcite .",
    "quite interestingly , the existence of the regge phase factors ( [ phase ] ) allows one to relate other discontinuities of @xmath22 to @xmath23 as sketched in fig.2 , one may consider a double discontinuity @xmath24 taking into account also the analytic discontinuity in the subenergy of one of the incident pomeron exchanges and then a triple discontinuity @xmath25 including the discontinuity over the two pomeron exchanges .",
    "the expression of the discontinuities , through generalized unitarity relations , is obtainedthrough the imaginary part of the relevant regge phase factors .",
    "one writes eliminates already all terms but one in the rather involved expression of the uncut vertex . ]",
    "@xcite : disc_1 a = disc_2 a = disc_3 a =  v_p|p  , disc where @xmath26 ia a real function describing the @xmath27 vertex in @xmath28 the notation @xmath29 indicates that the third regge exchange , corresponding to the summation over diffractive final states , may have ( and indeed _ has _ in our calculations ) a different effective trajectory avoiding a definition problem in ( [ disc ] ) . ] .    beyond these general relations of the s - matrix framework in the triple - regge regime , we will now take advantage of the hard probe , allowing one to introduce in the game the ( resummed ) perturbative qcd expansion at high energy ( small @xmath0 ) .",
    "let us start with general considerations . in a generic s - matrix approach , the analytic discontinuities of scattering amplitudes",
    "are related to a summation over a complete set of asymptotic _ hadronic _ final states . if however , the underlying microscopic field theory is at work with small renormalized coupling constant due to the hard probe , it is possible in some cases to approximate the same discontinuity using a complete set of _ partonic _ states .",
    "in particular , at high energy and within the approximation of leading logs ( and also large @xmath4 ) , qcd dipoles can be identified as providing such a basis .",
    "the interest is that the wave function of incoming states at the hard vertex is completely determined at the leading log level . using this wave - function and @xmath30 dipole transitions",
    "are needed @xcite . ] together with the appropriate @xmath31 factorization properties at the proton vertices @xcite , one is able to estimate the contributions to the various discontinuities of @xmath32 depicted in fig.2 within the ( resummed ) perturbative qcd framework .",
    "hence , the s - matrix relations ( [ disc ] ) , which express a simple phase relation in a pure regge framework , acquire a non - trivial meaning if one considers the various perturbative qcd ingredients and non - perturbative interfaces for the different discontinuities . in some sense , at it is shown in fig.3 , the discontinuities can be associated , whenever it is possible , with the hard qcd interaction at some time @xmath33 supplemented by a perturbative resummation of qcd radiation around this interaction time .",
    "the perturbative / non - perturbative interface has to be taken into account in order to put a reasonable limit to this derivation .",
    "depending on the discontinuity considered , one has different interaction pictures with a hard interaction at short time , and soft interaction diluted in space - time . instead of considering these pictures as different , we will use the s - matrix relations as a link between these pictures and thus will get non - trivial relations , as we will see later on .",
    "let us comment in turn on the pictures corresponding to @xmath34    * i ) * @xmath35 as we have seen from relation ( [ regge ] ) , is parametrized in terms of soft pomeron trajectories and of @xmath36 the unknown quantity parametrizing the interaction of the incident pomeron with the hard probe .",
    "the same @xmath21 is the one described by the partonic structure functions of the pomeron in the original scheme of ref.@xcite .",
    "@xmath37 is thus a natural framework for the partonic pomeron approach , since the analytical discontinuity over the diffractive final states is effectively expressed in terms of the hard interaction of the photon with the partons inside the incident pomeron .",
    "this is schematically depicted in the `` time - dependent '' scheme of fig.3 , where the soft incident pomerons are represented as living during a `` long '' time , while the partonic ( or qcd dipole ) process is initiated by the hard interaction .",
    "* ii ) * @xmath38 is quite interesting since it appears as a good candidate for a description of the soft colour interaction approach , see fig.3 .",
    "it appears as a partonic interaction very similar to the one describing ordinary deep - inelastic processes , in parallel with a `` soft '' correction evolving during a long time , corresponding to the uncut pomeron singularity in fig.3 . in section 4",
    ", we will see how this can be quantified using the interrelation with the qcd dipole picture .",
    "* iii ) * @xmath39 in this case the discontinuity is the `` full '' one , cutting the two pomerons together with the @xmath40 interaction .",
    "indeed , this full cutting is required by consistency of the qcd dipole picture based on a qcd calculation of the partonic states at the interaction time @xcite . in the description of hard diffraction ( see , e.g. , @xcite , the amplitude is deduced from a @xmath41 dipole transition , starting either from the primordial @xmath42 state of the photon ( `` elastic component '' ) or from a dipole excited in the photon wave function for higher diffractive masses ( `` inelastic component '' ) . in the following we shall focus on the main `` inelastic component '' , leaving the `` elastic component '' for a further study .",
    "this last analysis requires some more care about the perturbative / non - perturbative interface , which can not be restricted to usual factorisation properties . as studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , one has to distinghuish the cases whether we consider strictly the forward @xmath43 case or not .",
    "indeed , whenever @xmath44 the qcd radiation accompanying the hard probe extends far into the infrared region at the triple pomeron vertex , making the perturbative treatment difficult . at @xmath45",
    "due to an interesting conservation law of conformal dimensions in the bfkl framework , the perturbative resummation acquires more credibility , at least in the same approximation as for the total structure functions , .",
    "we will thus stick to using the perturbative calculations at @xmath43 , more precisely inspiring ourselves from those performed in paper ref .",
    "@xcite in the framework of the qcd dipole model limit of the qcd dipole model .",
    "the inclusion of such a state will be welcome , especially for large diffractive masses , but lies beyond the scope and the dipole framework of our present paper . ] .    due to the relations ( [ disc ] )",
    ", we expect that all three descriptions of hard diffraction , even if having seemingly distinct `` time evolutions '' , indeed correspond to an unique one in a complete qcd theory satisfying both macroscopic ( s - matrix ) and microscopic ( with interacting quarks and gluons ) requirements . in the absence",
    "yet of such a complete realization of the strong interaction theory , we shall adopt the following point of view : looking for a synthesis , we will first check whether all three approaches are consistent between themselves and then formulate hard diffractive structure functions realizing the synthesis .",
    "our starting point is the formula for the differential structure functions ( inelastic component ) at @xmath46 for longitudinal and transverse photon given in @xcite : ( q^2,y , y;p_t=0 ) =     =   _ c - i^c+i   ( 1-_1-_2- )   pf_t , l ( qq_0)^2  \\{y [ ( _ 1)+(_2 ) ] + ( y - y )   [ ( ) ] }  , biczy where ( ) ( ) = \\{2(1)-2()-2(1- ) } chi is the bfkl evolution kernel @xcite , @xmath47 the non - perturbative scale of primordial dipoles in the proton @xcite , ^diff   n^2_eff , nordif the normalization with @xmath48 the phenomenological number of primordial dipoles in the proton at scale @xmath47 and @xmath49 the sum over squared quark charges .",

    "@xmath50 is a cut - off function taking into account the non - perturbative description of the end of the rapidity spectrum of emitted gluons @xcite . in practice",
    ", it mainly affects the overall normalization ( also the form at edges of the @xmath51-dependence ) .",
    "it is one aspect of the lack of predictivity of the qcd dipole approach about the relative normalization of diffractive vs. non diffractive contributions",
    ".    one important ingredient of formula ( [ biczy ] ) is the delta function @xmath52 it expresses the conservation law of conformal dimensions at the triple pomeron vertex , which is a special feature of the bfkl property in the forward direction .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , we have choosen the qcd dipole formulation for the forward diffraction instead of the non - forward one @xcite , since it is expected to be less affected by non -perturbative contributions . on the other hand , it is phenomenologically not difficult to insert the non - perturbative phenomenological information on the @xmath53-dependence coming from the proton vertices in the non - forwardregion .",
    "indeed , it is convenient to parametrize the integrated diffractive structure function assuming an exponential behaviour @xmath54 well verified experimentally is presently known @xcite only on a global average to be of order @xmath55 it could depend on other variables but it happens to be very similar to the diffractive photoproduction slope , confirming the stability of this non perturbative parameter in different kinematical regions .",
    "we shall assume it constant in the following .",

    "for sake of a theoretical discussion in parallel with the formula ( [ tot ] ) for the total structure functions , we better choose a gaussian approximation valid in a reasonably large physical region .",
    "the gaussian approximation makes use of the following expansions ( 2 ) & & + 8 ^ 2 + o(^4 ) ( ) & & + 2   ( 12-)^2 + o((12-)^4 )  , expan where by definition ( = 12 ) = 42   ; ^ ",

    "@xmath65 .",
    "it is important to realize here a different expected result with the gaussian approximation for the total structure function ( [ tot ] ) in the bfkl formalism where one uses a saddle - point approximation near @xmath66 in particular , the dynamical exponent @xmath67 will be moved away from its canonical value at @xmath68 even without the virtuality factor @xmath69    after using the gaussian approximation , and relation ( [ fdiff ] ) , the resulting structure functions read : f_t , l^diff(q^2,y , y ) = n^diff  pf_t , l \\ { ( y - y )  * * _ s }  ( qq_0)^2*_s * ( -  )  , biczy2 where the saddle - point determines both the new `` effective dimension '' and `` effective intercept '' : =  ;   * * _ s = + epsilon for the pomeron - photon cross - section . by definition",
    "eta    the connection between the qcd dipole model and the partonic pomeron is thus well illustrated by the identification of our resulting formula ( [ biczy2 ] ) with the triple regge prediction ( [ regge ] ) considered at @xmath70 indeed , we identify the partonic pomeron intercept as @xmath71 which is natural in a bfkl framework at @xmath72 see the following discussion .",

    "tot2    the `` effective bfkl '' parameters for @xmath21 differ from the bfkl ones by an amount depending on @xmath75 also note that the `` diffusion '' term , which quantifies the amount of transverse momentum drift of gluons ( or dipoles ) along the bfkl evolution is renormalized by a factor @xmath76 the same as for the anomalous dimension @xmath77    while at large @xmath78 the formulae become similar , since for instance @xmath79 they sizeably differ from them provided @xmath80 in fact , this is realized in practice , since in present experiments @xmath81 on contrary , the features of the pomeron exchanges responsible for the gaps are those of the `` bare '' bfkl values taken at @xmath82 which can be interpreted as the partonic pomerons in the bfkl formalism since the scale @xmath47 is characteristic of the starting point of the qcd evolutions .",
    "thus the `` deformed '' bfkl parameters ( [ epsilon ] ) lead to a situation which can be called intermediate between a `` hard '' ( with effective dimension @xmath83 ) and a `` soft '' ( with @xmath84 ) pomeron , depending on the ratio @xmath85 also , the energy dependence is faster for the `` deformed '' bfkl singularity than for the partonic pomeron .",
    "this original situation is confirmed by numerical estimates @xcite .",
    "in order to confront and unify the qcd dipole and soft colour interaction approaches , we will estimate the overall contribution of hard diffraction to the total structure function at fixed value of @xmath86 as previously done , we will stick here to the `` inelastic '' ( leading - twist ) diffractive component leaving for further study the `` elastic '' component with small diffractive masses .",

    "this kind of `` off - shellness '' is quite remarkable , showing that a universal pomeron kernel @xmath67 can lead to non - universal effective behaviours when put in a hard interaction context",
    ". it would be interesting to look for an experimental study of this intringuing feature of the partonic pomeron .",
    "the compatibility with dglap evolution equations is also to be studied in detail .",
    "concerning the _ soft colour interaction _ prediction , relating the diffractive and non - diffractive components of deep - inelastic scattering , it seems quite compatible with the qcd predictions on the form of the amplitudes .",
    "however , an unexpected difference appears , since the typical values of the `` effective '' dimensions are different in both cases .",
    "it is clear for the integrated diffractive contribution @xmath109 , see ( [ biczy4 ] ) , comparing @xmath110 and @xmath111 it is also explicit from the analysis of @xmath112 itself that the relevant regions in the inverse mellin transforms are always for values of @xmath89 lower than for @xmath113 it will be interesting to test this prediction with data .    for developping this study beyond the first theoretical step",
    ", we would like to stress the feasability of phenomenological tests and applications .",
    "however this requires a similar analysis for the `` elastic '' qcd dipole component .",
    "one knows that the mueller regge formulae can be extended to generalized pomeron regge amplitudes ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we find interesting to elaborate on the s - matrix discontinuity properties in this context and their possible relations with `` higher - twist '' qcd contributions which are known to be relevant in this case .",
    "this deserves a specific study which is beyond the scope of this paper .    on the theoretical ground ,",
    "some interesting problems arise .",
    "for instance , the known problem of the application of a ( resummed ) perturbative scheme at @xmath114 require a better understanding of the matching between perturbative and non - perturbative features . also are interesting to develop the more precise extension of this scheme to regge cuts , next - leading bfkl contributions and , last but not least , unitarity corrections , which are required to identify properly the soft pomeron contributions .",
    "finally , the study of tevatron results on diffraction will be welcome , since the soft colour interaction approach seems to give some interesting clues , while factorization of the parton structure functions of the pomeron appears to be violated .",
    "thanks are due to jochen bartels , who draw the attention of one of us ( r.p . ) to the relations betwen regge discontinuities cf .",
    "the papers @xcite , to andrzej bialas for fruitful discussions and the inspiring paper in collaboration with wieczlaw czyz @xcite , and to christophe royon , for his help and advice .",
