    "the study of isospin asymmetric nuclear matter is closely related to a few issues which are presently the subjects of ongoing theoretical and experimental researches . at first",
    ", the isospin dependence of the nuclear equation of state ( eos ) shows up in the density dependence of the symmetry energy . a quantity which drives the structure of neutron rich nuclei and at supra - high densities the physics of supernovae explosions and the structure of compact neutron stars  @xcite .",
    "for instance , the stiffness  @xcite of the symmetry energy is directly related to the proton - fraction in @xmath1-equilibrated neutron stars , which is limited by the onset of the urca - process  @xcite . however , the symmetry energy is empirically known up to saturation densities , where it can be determined in nuclear structure studies from giant and pigmy resonances and from neutron skin thickness  @xcite . in the laboratory",
    "the symmetry energy can be explored in heavy ion collisions , where the knowledge of the high density eos is mandatory  @xcite for the description of the collision dynamics  @xcite within transport theory  @xcite .",
    "different heavy ion observables , _",
    "e.g. _ , collective transverse ( in - plane ) and elliptic ( out - of - plane ) flows  @xcite of particles and/or light fragments , as well as subthreshold strangeness production  @xcite are sensitive to the stiffness of the eos .",
    "furthermore , the isospin tracing  @xcite , isoscaling  @xcite , collective isospin flows  @xcite and isospin ratios of produced mesons  @xcite represent plausible tools to constrain the isovector eos at high densities and energies .",
    "moreover , heavy ion collisions allow to probe not only the density of created matter , but also the energy dependence of the nuclear potential  @xcite .",
    "theoretically , the density and energy dependence of the isovector eos beyond the saturation density is still controversial . in non - relativistic skyrme models",
    "both possibilities of a soft and a stiff symmetry energies  @xcite can be obtained . in the rmf models",
    "the symmetry energy is determined by the lorentz - structure of the isovector potential  @xcite , which is described by the vector - isovector @xmath0-field , or by @xmath0- and an attractive scalar @xmath2-fields  @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the symmetry energy rises with increasing baryon density leading to a stiff isovector eos at high densities .",
    "the models with density dependent ( dd ) couplings  @xcite predict a soft symmetry energy  @xcite , while the dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock ( dbhf ) calculations  @xcite and other rmf models with complementary exchange ( fock ) terms ( density - dependent relativistic hartree - fock ( rhf )  @xcite ) favour again a stiff one .    concerning the energy dependence ,",
    "the schrdinger equivalent optical potential in symmetric matter is well known phenomenologically  @xcite .",
    "however , different empirical analyses give different predictions for the energy dependence of isovector lane - potential  @xcite .",
    "the microscopic dbhf  @xcite and bhf  @xcite models predict a rather constant optical potential at low momenta with a strong decrease at high energies . in skyrme approaches both cases of a strong increase and a strong decrease of the lane - potential as a function of energy",
    "can be realized  @xcite .",
    "the dd models do not contain any explicit energy dependence , except if one modifies the original dd formalism  @xcite with additional interaction terms  @xcite , however , with the cost of additional parameters .",
    "note that , the energy dependence of the optical potential has been so far a crucial problem in standard rmf , where the energy dependence appears only due to relativistic effects .",
    "another question concerns the quasi - particle properties of nucleons in the nuclear matter .",
    "the isospin - dependent forces may result in a splitting between the in - medium masses of protons and neutrons which can strongly influence the dynamics in heavy - ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "however , it is still under debate , whether @xmath3 or @xmath4 holds in neutron rich matter . in non - relativistic approaches",
    "the in - medium particle mass is described through the energy dependence of the real part of the phenomenological mean - field  @xcite .",
    "again , the skyrme - like interactions predict both possibilities  @xcite for the non - relativistic in - medium mass  @xcite . in relativistic models",
    "the in - medium dependence of the particle mass arises from the lorentz - scalar character of the relativistic mean - field , i.e. , from the scalar selfenergy  @xcite .",
    "it is often denoted as `` effective mass '' or `` dirac mass '' , and these definitions we will use in this work . as in the non - relativistic case",
    ", same situation holds for the dbhf models where some calculations predict for the dirac mass @xmath3  @xcite and others @xmath4  @xcite . in rmf models",
    "the mass splitting is merely fixed by the lorentz structure of the isovector mean - field . due to the lorentz - vector character of the @xmath5-interaction the minimal @xmath6-models",
    "do not generate any in - medium mass splitting , except if one in addition introduces the lorentz - scalar @xmath2-field in the isovector channel  @xcite , or if one includes explicitly exchange ( fock ) terms in the relativistic formalism  @xcite .",
    "including the @xmath2-field one gets @xmath3 , while in the rhf models both cases @xmath7 are possible .",
    "so far these were the only possibilities to generate the mass splitting in the relativistic mean field theory  @xcite .    in this work we study the isovector interactions in asymmetric nuclear matter .",
    "our studies are based on the non - linear derivative ( nld ) model to rmf proposed in  @xcite .",
    "this approach describes remarkably well the bulk properties of nuclear matter and , in particular , the density dependence of the nuclear eos and the energy dependence of the proton - nucleus  @xcite as well as the antiproton - nucleus schrdinger equivalent optical potentials  @xcite .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in section  2",

    "such minimal walecka - type interactions describe successfully the static properties of nuclear matter around saturation density . however , they are not sufficient for the description of dynamical situations which occur in nucleon - nucleus and heavy - ion collisions , where this minimal model results in a wrong energy dependence of the mean - field .",

    "it is interesting to note that the rhf models contains also an energy dependence , apart the density dependent coupling functions . on the other hand , the dd models  @xcite ,",
    "see the dot - dashed ( dd ) and dot ( dd - me@xmath2 ) curves in the right panel of fig.[fig3 ] , predict a rather soft symmetry energy , which is similar to the nld results ( solid curve )",

    "in fact , the symmetry energy must saturate or , at least , show a rather soft behaviour at high baryon densities in order to respect the direct urca - limit  @xcite .",
    "this constraint is satisfied in the nld model .",

    "the solid curve corresponds to the nld results and the square symbols describe the dbhf calculations of ref .",

    "interestingly , in the nld model an effective mass splitting between protons and neutrons is generated in asymmetric matter by taking into account at the hartree - level the @xmath0-field only .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] for two asymmetry parameters @xmath108  ( dashed curves ) and @xmath96  ( dot - dashed curves ) .",
    "in particular , a mass splitting @xmath4 is obtained for neutron - rich matter , which becomes pronounced with increasing density and isospin asymmetry parameter .",
    "the in - medium mass splitting in the nld model is due to the isospin dependence of the single particle energy which appears in the selfenergies .",
    "note that , any explicit energy dependence of the scalar selfenergy will result in a @xmath0-induced mass splitting of nucleons in isospin asymmetric nuclear matter .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , an effective mass splitting between protons and neutrons do not occur in the walecka - type @xmath6-models solved at the hartree - level .",
    "the introduction of the scalar - isovector @xmath2-meson in the nuclear mean - field is necessary for this purpose  @xcite .",
    "however , one gets more parameters to fit the bulk asymmetry parameter at saturation density and , in particular , one needs to re - adjust again the @xmath5 coupling .",
    "this procedure can be ambiguous , since the @xmath109 coupling is not fixed neither by nuclear structure  @xcite nor by the one - boson - exchange models  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , as it has been investigated intensively in the past , the @xmath2-meson implies interesting effects if one goes beyond the saturation density of ground state nuclear matter and study its influence in compressed matter created in heavy - ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the available experimental data do not allow still decisive conclusions  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath110-models predict a mass splitting @xmath3 for neutron - rich matter  @xcite .",

    "can not be reversed in the nld model .",
    "we remind here , that rmf models treated on the hartree - fock level ( rhf )  @xcite , in which the selfenergies depend also explicitly on the single - particle energy due to the fock - terms , predict for the non - relativistic effective mass a mass splitting @xmath4 up to densities @xmath111 , but this trend is reversed for densities @xmath112  @xcite . therefore",
    ", the property @xmath3 is not a genuine feature of the rmf models , as has been believed so far .",
    "( 18.,8.0 ) ( 2.0,0.0 )    ( 18.,8.0 ) ( 2.0,0.0 )    the energy dependence of the isovector nuclear potential is described by the schrdinger - equivalent optical potential , see eq .",
    "( [ v_opt ] ) , but now separated between protons and neutrons .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows these potentials as function of the corresponding particle momentum and different asymmetry parameters @xmath87 .",
    "the observed isospin dependence of the proton ( right panel ) and neutron ( left panel ) optical potentials results from cancellation effects in eq .",
    "( [ v_opt ] ) between different isospin dependent components of the selfenergies .",
    "it is remarkable that the microscopic ( d)bhf calculations  @xcite predict very similar behaviour as the nld model .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , where the proton and neutron optical potentials are shown as a function of the asymmetry parameter @xmath87 at fixed density @xmath113 and three different momenta , as indicated in fig .",
    "indeed , at low momenta up to the fermi momentum ( left and middle panels ) the isospin splitting between the proton and neutron optical potentials in the nld model ( solid and dashed curves ) follows closely the microscopic calculations ( filled and open squares for dbhf , filled and open triangles for bhf ) . at higher momenta ( right panel )",
    "the nld isospin splitting is similar to the ( d)bhf calculations , up to an absolute value .",
    "this is related to a stronger energy dependence in the nld model relative to these microscopic approaches .",
    "recall , that this strong energy dependence of the nld potential is essential for the description of the schrdinger - equivalent optical potential shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "( 18.,8.0 ) ( 2.0,0.0 )    the energy dependence of the isovector optical potential is conventionally described by the lane - type potential .",
    "it is defined as follows  @xcite @xmath114 where @xmath115 denotes the proton / neutron schrdinger - equivalent optical potentials .",
    "[ fig7 ] shows the momentum dependence of the lane - potential in the nld approach ( solid curve ) . also",
    "the results of linear walecka model denoted as rhd ( dashed curve ) and different microscopic approaches are shown .",
    "the linear walecka model predicts an almost linear behaviour in energy , as in the isoscalar case , and it diverges for @xmath116 .",
    "the lane potential in the nld model shows an opposite behaviour with respect to rhd .",
    "it decreases with increasing particle momentum .",
    "in contrast to the symmetric proton- and antiproton - nucleus optical potentials  @xcite , the empirical situation in the isovector case is still not well known .",
    "different empirical studies predict an opposite behaviour of @xmath117 versus momentum .",
    "in fact , the analysis of madland _ et al . _",
    "@xcite predicts an increase of the isovector potential with increasing momentum , while in the analysis of lane _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite a decrease of @xmath117 with rising momentum has been obtained . nevertheless , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , the nld calculations agree with the calculations from the microscopic brueckner theory which also show the decrease of the lane potential as a function of the momentum .",
    "in summary , the nld formalism which incorporates on a mean - field level the energy dependence of the nucleon selfenergies has been applied to isospin - asymmetric nuclear matter . the model describes the bulk properties of symmetric matter and compares well with the results from microscopic brueckner calculations .",
    "due to the explicit energy dependence of the nuclear mean - field , the nld model reproduces very well the empirical proton and antiproton optical potentials  @xcite .",
    "same energy dependence is responsible for the softening of the eos at high densities . in the present model",
    "the isospin effects are generated by using the conventional @xmath0-meson exchange .",
    "such a minimal extension of the nld formalism describes the symmetry energy around saturation and predict its softening ( saturation ) at high baryon densities .",
    "this feature is an important element in the description of dense nuclear systems created in heavy ion collisions and/or in the interior of neutron stars .",
    "however , such a soft symmetry energy is at variance with standard rhd models , where it rises linearly with increasing density .    as a novel feature",
    "we find that the energy dependent nld interactions generate a mass splitting between protons and neutrons already within the conventional @xmath0-exchange scheme .",
    "in particular , a dirac mass splitting @xmath4 is obtained for neutron - rich matter .",
    "however , we point out that the @xmath0-induced nucleon mass splitting is a rather general feature of energy dependent interactions and should show up in any model which incorporates them .",
    "we further discussed the energy dependence of the isovector optical potentials .",
    "we found that the nld model leads to a decreasing lane - type potential with increasing particle momentum .",
    "this disagrees with the conventional rmf models , but is consistent with the results from microscopic brueckner calculations .",
    "also the comparison of the isovector splitting in the proton / neutron optical potentials agrees well with the results from dbhf and bhf microscopic approaches .",
    "these suggest that the nld @xmath6 mean - field model which accommodates the energy dependence of nucleon selfenergies , is in qualitative agreement with microscopic ( dirac ) brueckner calculations . since the nld model describes also asymmetric matter features fairly well and agrees with microscopic dbhf models , it could be interesting to apply the nld approach to finite nuclei",
    ". however , due to the energy dependence of the fields , the main advantage of the nld approach would be its application to the description of heavy - ion reactions within the transport theory .",
