    "using the hipparcos parallaxes , absolute magnitudes for members of the group were determined .",
    "the origin of these non - magnetic , a to f - type metal - deficient dwarfs still remains controversial .",
    "the two main competing theories involve diffusion , either in combination with mass - loss ( michaud & charland 1986 ) , or accretion of interstellar matter as in post - agb stars ( turcotte & charbonneau 1993 ) .",
    "the latter model requires that stars are very close to the zero - age main sequence .",
    "the recent discovery of stars in the young orion ob1 association and in ngc  2264 ( paunzen & gray 1997 ) seems to support the predictions of the accretion theory . but",
    "an age determination of galactic field stars by iliev & barzova ( 1995 , hereafter ib95 ) , on the other hand , resulted in evolved members .",
    "these stars were recalibrated using the accurate new absolute magnitudes as well as new stellar evolutionary tracks ( cesam ; morel 1997 ) . furthermore",
    ", pre - main sequence models ( palla & stahler 1993 ) were used to confirm the results .",
    "candidates as well as members of the group were taken from paunzen et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and paunzen & gray ( 1997 ) .",
    "the hipparcos data for the programme stars were extracted with the help of simbad .",
    "the observed visual magnitudes were used to calculate the absolute magnitudes @xmath0(h ) .",
    "possible correlations of the observed parallaxes with other astrophysical quantities ( e.g. apparent distance , effective temperature , metallicity , etc . ) were examined ( see also paunzen 1997 ) .",
    "no systematic trend between the ( old ) photometrically calibrated and ( new ) absolute magnitudes has been detected .",
    "although there are some individual differences , the overall validity of the `` standard '' calibration for the ( chemically peculiar ) stars is proven .",
    "ib95 presented an age and mass determination for 20 well established stars ( and vega ) .",
    "they concluded that most of the investigated stars are in the middle of their main sequence evolution , which is believed to be inconsistent with the much favoured accretion theory .",
    "only one star of their sample ( hd  290799 , a member of the young orion ob1 association ) seems to fulfill the predictions of the accretion theory .",
    "the hipparcos data ( available for 18 stars from ib95 ) were used to test their conclusions .",
    "after the calibration of the programme stars in a @xmath1 versus @xmath2 diagram , the new cesam models ( morel 1997 ) were used to determine the ages and masses .",
    "the initial parameters of the evolutionary tracks were x=0.7 and z=0.02 ( solar abundance ) ; these values were found to be valid for the study of ( chemically peculiar ) stars by ib95 .",
    "this seems to be appropriate because the main contribution to the overall metallicity is due to c , n and o ( solar abundant in stars ) .",
    "furthermore , there are strong indications that the phenomenon is restricted to the stellar surface ( holweger & rentzsch - holm 1995 ) .    due to the individual corrections to the absolute magnitude ,",
    "all programme stars ( except hd  193256 and hd  193281 , a distant close binary system ) are , within the errors , significantly _ younger _ and _ less massive_. in order to test a possible pre - main sequence hypothesis and thus the consistency with the accretion theory , the evolutionary tracks from palla & stahler ( 1993 ) were applied .",
    "it turned out that six stars ( hd  30422 , hd  31295 , hd  107233 , hd  110411 , hd  125162 ( itself ) and hd  183324 ) are indeed _ very close to the main sequence_. this is proven by the individual results derived from the pre- and main sequence tracks . for three additional stars ( hd  38545 , hd  111786 and hd  221756 ) , both models are very close , resulting in the same conclusion with a high confidence .",
    "these findings contradict the results from ib95 and strongly support the accretion theory .",
    "the remaining nine programme stars are on the main sequence ( using the appropriate models ) but still significantly less evolved than reported by ib95 ( see fig . 2 therein ) .",
    "these results are consistent with values for other low - mass `` dusty '' pre - main sequence objects ( see also gerbaldi & faraggiana 1993 ) such as herbig ae / be stars or @xmath3 pictoris .",
    "the explanation for stars as true pre - main sequence object could also lead to a solution for the apparent small number of members .",
    "a star with 2m@xmath4 needs only a few 10@xmath5 years to reach the main sequence .",
    "the probability to find such objects is therefore very small compared to the lifetime on the main sequence ( there is also only a similarly small number of herbig ae stars known ) .",
    "this conclusion is further strengthened by the lack of stars in open clusters older than 10@xmath6 years ( paunzen & gray 1997 ) .",
    "with the hipparcos data , absolute magnitudes and evolutionary status ( mass and age ) for the group of stars were estimated .",
    "no systematic influence of the apparent distance , effective temperature , metallicity and rotational velocity was found on the difference between the photometrically calibrated and the `` new '' absolute magnitudes , thus proving the validity of the `` standard '' photometric calibration ( e.g. in the strmgren system ) for these ( chemically peculiar ) stars .",
    "it turned out that six stars ( e.g. itself ) are definitely _ very close to the main sequence _ , and this is also true , with a high probability , of three additional programme stars .",
    "these results contradict the conclusions of ib95 and support the accretion theory .",
    "the small number of stars ( statistical effect due to the short `` lifetime '' on the pre - main sequence ) and the lack of them in open clusters older than 10@xmath6 years further strengthen the accretion hypothesis .",
