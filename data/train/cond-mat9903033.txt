    "the thermal properties of glasses exhibit some specific and unusual features which are well known for quite some time @xcite .",
    "these features are apparent in the specific heat and the thermal conductivity but we would like to focus here on the thermal conductivity @xmath0 . the temperature dependence of @xmath1 can be separated in 3 distinct temperature domains : + - at very low temperature ( @xmath2k ) the thermal conductivity increases like @xmath3 .",
    "this increase can be explained within the tunneling model @xcite which has been proposed almost thirty years ago .",
    "+ - at intermediate temperatures ( @xmath4k ) the thermal conductivity exhibits a `` plateau '' for which several explanations have been given @xcite .",
    "an extension of the tunneling model , the soft - potential model , has been proposed and gives a coherent description of the plateau by introducing the concept of `` soft vibrations '' @xcite .",
    "+ - at high temperature , ( @xmath5k ) , @xmath6 rises smoothly and seems to saturate to a limiting value @xmath7 unlike crystals where @xmath8 at elevated temperature .",
    "recently this second rise of the thermal conductivity has also been explained within the soft - potential model @xcite which appears to be able to account for all the thermal anomalies of glasses over the whole temperature range .",
    "+ our aim here is not to propose a new or alternative explanation of the above mentioned anomalies .",
    "the purpose is to perform a molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation on a model silica glass using a very widely used interaction potential ( the so - called `` bks '' potential @xcite ) without any pre - conception of the model able to explain the thermal anomalies of silica .",
    "this means that we do not add or inject an _ a priori _ quantity in the potential to reproduce a specific model .",
    "we use the standard definition of the heat transport coefficients that we calculate directly in our simulation box .",
    "in fact we introduce artificially inside the system a `` hot '' and a `` cold '' plate which therefore induce a heat flux .",
    "this flux creates a temperature gradient and once the steady state has been reached we can determine the thermal conductivity . by using plates compatible with the periodic boundary conditions we are able to calculate the thermal conductivity directly during the simulations without any additional parameter .",
    "this technique has been inspired by earlier studies @xcite in which the plates were treated like hard walls and has mainly been applied to the calculation of the thermal conductivity in 1- or 2-dimensional systems @xcite .",
    "nevertheless very recently oligschleger and sch@xmath9n applied the same method in a study of heat transport phenomena in crystalline and glassy samples ( mainly selenium ) @xcite . in parallel to these studies which can be called _ in situ _",
    ", other methods relying on the use of the density and heat flux correlation functions @xcite or on the kubo and greenwood - kubo formalism @xcite have been developed in order to determine the thermal conductivity of solids .",
    "our results for the thermal conductivity obtained with the bks potential compare reasonably well with the experimental data .",
    "first of all the order of magnitude is correct above 20k and , at least in the range 20k-400k , a nice quantitative agreement is obtained .",
    "furthermore , by taking care of finite - size corrections in a very simple phenomenological way , we are able to reproduce the plateau around 10k .",
    "of course , the very low temperature @xmath3 behavior , which is known to be due to quantum effects , is out of the scope of such a classical calculation . + this paper is organized in the following way . in section",
    "ii we describe the _ modus operandi _ we have used to obtain the thermal conductivity . in section iii we present first the results obtained directly from the md simulations .",
    "then we show the effect of finite - size corrections on these results and discuss our findings . in section",
    "iv we draw the major conclusions .",
    "except the determination of @xmath6 , the simulations are standard classical md calculations on a microcanonical ensemble of 648 particles ( 216 sio@xmath10 molecules ) interacting via the bks potential .",
    "like in a previous study @xcite the particles are packed in a cubic box of edge length @xmath11  ( the density is approximately equal to 2.18g/@xmath12 ) on which periodic boundary conditions are applied to simulate a macroscopic sample .",
    "the equations of motion are integrated using a fourth order runge - kutta algorithm with a time step @xmath13 equal to @xmath14fs .",
    "the glassy samples are obtained after a quench from the liquid state ( @xmath15k ) at a constant quenching rate of @xmath16k / s .",
    "+ the principle of the thermal conductivity determination is illustrated in fig.1 .",
    "we consider two plates @xmath17 and @xmath18 perpendicular to the ox axis and located at @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "these plates have a width @xmath21 along ox and their surface is @xmath22 .",
    "the positions of these plates permit to keep the periodic boundary conditions without introducing an asymmetry in the system .",
    "this has the advantage , compared to other studies @xcite in which the introduction of the thermostatic plates breaks the symmetry , to use a relatively small number of particles . at each iteration the particles which are inside @xmath17 and @xmath18 are determined and their number is respectively @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "once these particles are determined a constant energy @xmath25 is subtracted from the energy of the particles inside @xmath17 and added to the energy of the particles in @xmath18 . by imposing the heat transfer in this manner we insure a constant heat flux per unit area @xmath26 @xcite which is equal to @xmath27 .",
    "( the factor 2 comes from the fact that the heat flux coming from the hot plate splits equally into two parts to reach the cold plate ) .",
    "the energy modification is done by rescaling the velocities of the particles inside the plates . nevertheless to avoid an artificial drift of the kinetic energy",
    "this has to be done with the total momentum of the plates being conserved . for a particle @xmath28 inside @xmath17 or @xmath18 the modified velocity",
    "is given at each iteration by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the velocity of the center of mass of the ensemble of particles in the plate and @xmath31 depending on whether the particles are inside @xmath18 or @xmath17 .",
    "the relative kinetic energy @xmath32 is given by @xmath33    following the standard definition of the transport coefficients @xcite the thermal conductivity is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the temperature gradient along ox .",
    "this formula , known as the fourier s law of heat flow , is only valid when a stable , linear temperature profile is obtained in the system . to calculate the gradient we divide the simulation box into @xmath36 `` slices '' along ox in which the temperature is calculated at each iteration . due to the periodic boundary conditions we can concentrate only on the @xmath37 slices between @xmath19 and @xmath38 and have a better determination of the temperature in these slices since by symmetry arguments these slices are equivalent to the @xmath37 slices located outside @xmath39 $ ] .",
    "we can therefore determine the temperature @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) of each slice at each iteration . by averaging each @xmath40 over a large number of iterations to kill the unavoidable large temperature fluctuations ( due to the small average number of particles in each slice ) , we are able to determine after which simulation time @xmath42 the averaged profile of @xmath43 can reasonably well be approximated by a straight line .",
    "after that time we estimate @xmath43 using a first order least square fit of the averaged @xmath40 s , the slope of which will give us the temperature gradient . at that point",
    "all the quantities necessary to calculate @xmath0 are determined .",
    "+ concerning the `` practical details '' of the simulation we have checked that the results are independent on the choice of @xmath25 and for the other quantities we have used a compromise between computer time and accuracy of the results .",
    "here are the values used in our simulations : the width of the plates has been taken equal to @xmath44  which means that approximately 30 - 40 atoms are inside the plates at each iteration . the temperature gradient has been determined on @xmath45 slices , each slice containing approximately 100 particles .",
    "@xmath0 has been determined on samples which have been saved all along the quenching procedure and therefore have different temperatures t. to have the same treatment for each sample we have fixed @xmath25 to 1% of @xmath46 which appears to be a good choice .",
    "the temperature gradients obtained this way are small enough to insure the validity of eq .",
    "the most problematic choice is the simulation time @xmath42 . indeed in order to reach the steady state one needs long md runs . for us",
    "a typical run consists of 50000 md steps ( 35 ps ) directly after the quench during which the average temperature is fixed and the heat transfer is switched on . then we perform 450000 supplemental steps ( 315 ps ) with only the heat transfer but no other constraints during which the results are collected and averaged . after this time",
    "the temperature gradient should have converged and the value of @xmath0 should be constant .",
    "as we can see in figure 2 , this can be considered to be qualitatively true for the samples above 10k but certainly not for the low temperature systems .",
    "in fact at low temperature longer runs ( 1 million steps ( 700 ps ) ) are necessary and still the convergence is not perfect ( it is interesting to note that though our method converges slowly , it still converges faster than the calculation of @xmath47 given by a steady state experiment without a temperature gradient ( @xcite , p.61 ) ) .",
    "it is also worth noticing that the characteristic sigmoidal shape of the temperature profile observed at 1k is consistent to what is expected in the intermediate regime where only heat transport over a small distance close to the plates is effective . in the following",
    ", only the results above 8k will be reported .",
    "the results obtained for the thermal conductivity as a function of temperature in our model silica glass are reproduced in fig.3 and compared to experimental data collected between 1 and 100k @xcite and up to 1000k @xcite .",
    "the first observation is that our simulations with the bks potential give the correct order of magnitude over the whole temperature range ( except at very low temperatures ) with no adjustable parameters apart from the `` technical parameters '' described above and the constitutive potential parameters . at very high temperatures ,",
    "say above 500k , one observes a more marked saturation of @xmath6 than in the experiments .",
    "this might be explained by the fact that other contributions than the one described here can occur in the experiments at such high temperatures .",
    "it is known that the radiative contributions ( photon transport ) in particular increase quickly in this temperature range and can become of the order of the phonon contributions @xcite . in a large intermediate range ,",
    "20k to 400k , the agreement between the calculated and experimental values is very good . indeed in the simulation also @xmath0 increases in this temperature range unlike what is found in crystalline samples .",
    "the major discrepancy between the simulation and the experiment can be seen between 8 and 20k since we do not find the characteristic plateau in the thermal conductivity . in the following",
    ", we would like to argue that this discrepancy is essentially due to finite size effects .",
    "+ in our cubic finite simulation box with periodic boundary conditions , the components of the @xmath48 wavevectors take discrete values of the form @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is a relative integer ( and similarly for the other space directions ) , and one can not find , in principle , propagative phonons with a frequency smaller than a lower cut - off @xmath51 which can be estimated by @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the transverse sound velocity . considering the experimental value @xmath54 cm / s for silica@xcite this gives @xmath55 thz ( in practice , when diagonalizing the dynamical matrix in our low temperature sample , we find , similarly to a previous work done on the same system @xcite , a slightly lower first non - zero frequency @xmath56 thz , in agreement with the existence of an excess of modes ( maybe non - propagative ) , the so - called boson peak@xcite , in this frequency range @xcite . therefore using the correspondence @xmath57 which gives the average phonon frequency @xmath58 of the phonons excited at temperature @xmath59 , there are certainly not enough phonons excited at temperatures below @xmath60 in our box to be able to reproduce the experimental curve correctly . in fig.3 , the departure between our simulations and experiments",
    "is actually seen at a temperature of the order of 20k , in good agreement with this analysis .",
    "+ to try to put this argument on more quantitative grounds , let us assume that the thermal conductivity is given by the usual formula @xcite , @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the heat capacity per unit volume , @xmath63 and @xmath64 the velocity and mean free path of the phonons , respectively . when applying such a formula to glasses one has to be careful because of localization effects .",
    "obviously @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the characteristics of the `` propagative '' phonons , i.e. those which really contribute to the transport phenomena .",
    "consequently the heat capacity @xmath62 to be considered should be only due to the contribution of these phonons and therefore ( according to other authors @xcite ) should exhibit at low temperature the usual debye behavior ( the same as in crystals ) . if we assume also that the lack of phonons in our box , i.e. a wrong value of @xmath62 , is the essential cause for the underestimated calculated value of @xmath0 , a very simple and crude way to take care of this is to multiply our simulation results by a corrective factor @xmath65 which can be estimated by taking for @xmath66 and @xmath67 the heat capacities calculated in the debye approximation for an infinite system and a finite cubic box of edge @xmath68 , respectively . to calculate this temperature dependent factor we have used the standard formulae@xcite",
    "@xmath69 @xmath70 with @xmath71 . in the expression of @xmath67",
    "the double sum runs over the three polarizations @xmath72 and over the first @xmath73 @xmath48 vectors ( quantized as indicated above ) of lowest norm @xmath74 . for @xmath73 and @xmath68",
    "we have taken the simulation values @xmath75 and @xmath11  and for the sound velocities the experimental values @xmath76 cm / s and @xmath77 cm / s @xcite .",
    "when correcting our numerical data this way , we obtain the open squares represented in fig.3 which turn out to be in very good agreement with the experimental results in the plateau region .",
    "of course , our reasoning is very crude since it assumes that finite size corrections affect only the heat capacity contribution in the expression of @xmath0 ( eq.5 ) and that the harmonic approximation holds for the propagative phonons in that temperature range , however we think that the agreement with the data can not be fortuitous .",
    "it is unfortunate that we could not obtain more reliable results at temperatures lower than 8k ( due to the impossibility to reach the permanent regime ) . anyway , after correction , these results would certainly give larger values for @xmath0 than the experiments since it is known that , at very low temperatures , the propagative phonons start to be scattered on the quantum two level systems@xcite and therefore should have a lower mean free path than the one obtained in a classical calculation like the one performed here .",
    "in conclusion we have presented the results of an extensive classical molecular dynamics simulation aimed to determine the thermal conductivity in a model silica glass .",
    "this determination has been done directly inside the md scheme with the use of the standard equations governing the macroscopic transport coefficients and no pre - conceived model has been assumed .",
    "moreover it turns out that this method has considerable advantages ( especially concerning the length of the simulations ) compared to the standard methods usually implemented to calculate the transport coefficients @xcite .",
    "the calculated values of the thermal conductivity are in good agreement with the experimental data at high temperature ( @xmath78k ) and by including finite size corrections in a simple way we are able to reproduce the plateau in the thermal conductivity around @xmath79k , which has been the topic of several interpretations in the literature @xcite .",
    "the agreement between the calculated and the experimental values of the thermal conductivity is even more striking when taking into account the ultra - fast quenching rate used to generate our amorphous samples .",
    "this shows once more the good quality of the bks potential which permits to reproduce the thermal anomalies of vitreous silica with no additional parameters .",
    "+ of course , our arguments on the finite size effects should be tested in the future by running larger samples .",
    "nevertheless the simple phenomenological correction is so efficient that one can reasonably claim that the initial discrepancy between the calculated and experimental values of the thermal conductivity is indeed due to finite size effects and not to a weakness of the method .",
    "therefore we believe that this technique is a good way to calculate the thermal properties of materials directly inside molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "+ most of the numerical calculations have been done on the ibm / sp2 computer at cnusc ( centre national universitaire sud de calcul ) , montpellier .",
