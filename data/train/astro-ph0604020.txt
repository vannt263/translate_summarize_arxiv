    "in field galaxies , neutral hydrogen gas gets either converted into molecular form ( and into stars ) or ionised .",
    "a small fraction does escape in galactic winds .",
    "however in galaxies in clusters , substantial amount of gas goes into the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) , making the members _ deficient _ in  relative to the gas content of a field galaxy of a similar morphological type . such  deficiency in cluster spirals",
    "is well reported in the literature .",
    "members in groups may also lose gas to the intra - group medium ( igm ) and become relatively _ deficient _ in .",
    "galaxies in some of the hickson compact groups have been reported to be gas deficient @xcite but such deficiency is still debated @xcite .",
    "gas deficiency in loose group environment has not yet been investigated systematically .",
    "for the first time ,  deficiency by a factor more than 1.6 has been reported in some members of a non - compact group in the puppis region @xcite . in some of the loose groups ,",
    "the igm is found to have enhanced metalicity , suggesting recent gas removal from the member galaxies @xcite .",
    "thus , investigating gas removal processes operating in loose groups is timely and important .",
    "two mechanisms are considered important for gas removal : tidal interaction and ram - pressure stripping .",
    "ram pressure stripping @xcite is effective when the  surface mass density is less than @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the stellar surface mass density . clearly , larger the icm or igm density , @xmath3 , and galaxy velocity dispersion , @xmath4 , the more effective is this stripping .",
    "clusters satisfy these requirements and ram - pressure stripping is considered an effective process in them . in groups ,",
    "though , both these quantities are lower , especially dispersion by a factor of 10 and therefore ram pressure stripping is considered ineffective .",
    "tidal interactions on the other hand , involve gravitational interaction between two or more galaxies as they pass by each other .",
    "the lower relative velocities in groups allow larger interaction timescales making tidal stripping the likely process for gas removal .",
    "this , in a larger sense , includes galaxy ` harassment ' , where the tidal stripping is caused by the overall gravitational potential of the group .",
    "however , a significant number of loose groups have been found to have hot gas in them emitting diffuse x - rays @xcite . in such cases ,",
    "ram pressure assistance can not be ruled out , making x - ray bright groups more  deficient than non x - ray bright groups .",
    "@xcite studied selected galaxies in five groups , ngc 533 , 5044 , 2300 , 5846 and 4261 , detected to have a hot igm by rosat , and found a few of them to be strongly deficient in .",
    "they find the deficiency to be related to the physical proximity of the galaxy to the x - ray region .",
    "we have undertaken to study in detail the   content of galaxies in groups with and without x - ray detection , covering a wide - range in x - ray luminosity .",
    "here we report the first part of our study , viz . a comparative analysis of   content in small loose groups based on hipass and other existing single dish data .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : the next section deals with the sample selection ,   data and its processing details . in section 3 ,",
    "we report the analyses of the data and our results .",
    "the possible explanations of the results are discussed in section 4 .",
    "the work is summarised in section 5 .",
    "our sample is made of twenty seven groups , ten belonging to the x - ray bright category and seventeen belonging to the non x - ray bright category .",
    "we chose all the x - ray bright groups , totalling 10 , from the x - ray atlas of nearby poor groups @xcite satisfying the following criteria : most members have single dish   measurements , their distances @xmath5 50 mpc ( a value of 100  mpc@xmath6 is used for the hubble constant throughout this paper ) and their membership is less than 25 ( to avoid poor clusters ) .",
    "their x - ray luminosities are in the range from 2.0@xmath7 and 6.3@xmath8 erg@xmath9 .",
    "eight x - ray non - detected groups ( six from @xcite , and two from @xcite ) and 9 all - spiral groups ( all the group members being late type spirals ) , make up the non x - ray bright category .",
    "non compact all spiral groups are not expected to have diffuse x - rays from their igm ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and therefore have been included to augment the non x - ray bright sample .",
    "the distances and memberships of these seventeen groups also follow the same criteria as the x - ray bright groups . among the 27 groups that make up our sample , 13 are from the southern hemisphere and 14 are from the northern hemisphere . for most of the southern hemisphere galaxies hipass database has been used .",
    "given that typical  masses in these galaxies will be a few times @xmath10  @xmath11 , the hipass sensitivity constrains that these groups be nearer than @xmath12 40 mpc . for the rest of the galaxies ,  measurements from the literature have been used ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this imposes some practical difficulties : different surveys have different detection limits and resolution ; some of the group members did not have any   observation ; in some other cases , the errors on the integrated flux densities were not quoted and we have used an average of the errors quoted for the other group members .    for group memberships we have followed the lyon group of galaxies ( lgg ) catalog @xcite .",
    "all lgg members of a group within a diameter of 1.2 mpc ( typical crossing distance in @xmath12 5 gyr ) about the group center are included . in most cases",
    ", this circle seems a natural boundary . in a few cases where a significant fraction of lgg members lie outside this range ,",
    "we have extended the circle to a diameter of 1.5 mpc about the group center .",
    "this is done to ensure that the computed  deficiency truely reflects the property of the group .",
    "galaxies lying outside a diameter of 1.5 mpc have been excluded .",
    "we also include as members of the group all galaxies found using nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) within the spatial and velocity extent defined by the lgg members .",
    "all members thus chosen are tabulated in tables 3 and 4 under their respective group names with distances to the groups derived from their velocities given in brackets .",
    "the table lists the source names , morphological type ( @xmath13 ) , optical diameter in arcminute ( @xmath14 ( ) ) , gas surface matter density in logarithmic units ( @xmath15 ) ,  deficiency ( ) , angular distance from the group centre in arcmin ( ang . ) and the telescopes used for obtaining the  data ( tel . ) .",
    "footnote at the end of table 4 explains the symbols used for the different telescopes .",
    "groups have been ordered in increasing right ascension but the galaxies within the groups have been ordered in increasing distance from their centers .",
    "the later ordering has been done to highlight the location of early - type and  deficient galaxies with respect to the group centers . for galaxies that belong to an early morphological type ( e , s0 and s0/a ) ,",
    "a `` @xmath16 '' is marked in columns 4 , 5 and 7 ; such galaxies have not been used in this study .",
    "spiral galaxies which do not have  data are denoted by an `` x '' in column 7 .",
    "a `` nd '' in column 7 indicates a spiral not detected in .",
    "optical diameter , d@xmath17 , is taken from rc3 catalogue using ned : it is the optical major isophotal diameter measured at or reduced to a surface brightness level m@xmath18 = 25.0 b - m / ss .",
    "the hipass spectra obtained towards the galaxies were used to find the centroid velocities and the integrated flux densities ( @xmath19 in jykm  s@xmath20 being the flux per beam per channel and @xmath21 being the velocity resolution ) after fitting and removing second order polynomial baselines .",
    "unipops package was used for this processing .",
    "there were several instances of confusion in the case of hipass data ( parkes beam has an fwhm of 14 at 21 cm ) .",
    "in the case of northern groups , multiple measurements with different telescopes were available .",
    "this and the fact that the beamsizes were smaller than that of parkes reduced the instances of confusion . in all cases of confusion",
    ", the deficiencies have been calculated assuming it to be equal among the confused galaxies .",
    "the total gas mass ( 1 ) can not be straight away used for studying gas removal in galaxies as the  content depends both on their sizes and morphological types .",
    "in fact , the disk size seems to be a more important diagnostic for the   mass than the morphological type @xcite .",
    "gas mass surface density  proves to be a better measure of  content as it incorporates the diameter of the spiral disk .",
    "another advantage of using  over 1 as a measure of   content is that  is distance independent and therefore free from its uncertainty .",
    "the expected values of  for various morphological types are taken from @xcite . while @xcite used the ugc blue major diameters , we have used the rc3 major diameters . to take care of the difference in the surface matter densities that result from the use of rc3 diameters , we add a value of 0.08 @xcite to the expected surface matter densities given by @xcite .",
    "the final values of expected   used in this paper are given in table 1 .",
    "deficiency of a single galaxy is determined following the usual definition viz .",
    ": @xmath22 an average of this over all the  detected galaxies is used as a measure of the   deficiency of the groups , hereafter referred to as the `` group deficiency '' .",
    "table 2 lists the group names , their x - ray luminosity in logarithmic units , the calculated group deficiencies with 1 @xmath23 error on them , for the 10 x - ray bright groups , the 8 x - ray non - detected ones and the 9 all - spiral groups that have no reported x - ray observation .",
    "both local and large scale environments affect the  content in galaxies .",
    "interactions and mergers are processes that are likely to be similar in groups with and without diffuse x - ray emission . therefore , we first tested if the presence of diffuse x - ray gas affects the  content any further .",
    "we find that , on average , the galaxies in x - ray groups have a  deficiency of 0.28 @xmath240.04 whereas the ones in the non x - ray groups show an insignificant deficiency of 0.09 @xmath240.03 .",
    "a few groups in the later catagory , eg .",
    "ngc584 , ngc7582 and ugc9858 , that have significant  deficiency also have upper limits to their x - ray luminosities close to the lowest luminosity among the x - ray detected groups .    for the purpose of this analysis , we constituted two _ composite _ groups , one with and another without diffuse x - ray emission , using all the   detected group members .",
    "the group distances are derived from the mean radial velocities of the  detected members .",
    "these are used to convert the projected angular distances of the group members with respect to group centres to linear distances and the optical major diameters , d@xmath17 , to linear sizes .",
    "the top panel of fig .",
    "1 shows  deficiency , as defined in section 2 , for all members of these _ composite _ groups with respect to their radial distances .",
    "no variation of   deficiency with radial distance from the group centre is seen , but the fractional number of   deficient galaxies in x - ray groups is higher than in non x - ray groups .",
    "the bottom panel of fig .",
    "1 shows  deficiency distributed with respect to the linear sizes of the galaxies .",
    "deficiency seems to increase with size which could be a bias . 1",
    "is observed to be proportional to d@xmath25 @xcite .",
    "thus  surface density decreases with d@xmath17 as d@xmath26 .",
    "so computing  deficiency with a constant value of  for each type leads to an overestimate for galaxies of large diameters and an underestimate for those with small ones .",
    "the effect present in fig .",
    "1 agrees quantitatively with this explanation .",
    "the average effect of such a bias on the galaxies of the sample leads to an underestimate of 0.04 on .",
    "however , this does not affect the results of our comparative study .",
    "the top panel of fig .  2 shows the cumulative distribution of  deficiency for the two categories , xray - bright and non x - ray groups .",
    "cumulative distribution represents , for each value , q@xmath27 , of the quantity , q , given in the abscissae , the proportion of galaxies , for which q",
    "@xmath28 q@xmath27 . three statistical tests , kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) , mann - whitney ( mw ) and wald - wolfowitz ( ww ) , were performed on the cumulative distributions of the quantity to test if the two samples are drawn from the same parent population . in the case of  deficiency the probabilities are : ks : 8.0% ; mw : 6.0% and ww : 1.1% . the low probabilities indicate that the two groups are unlikely to be drawn from the same parent distribution , i.e. one group tends to be more   rich relative to the other .",
    "small number statisitics , projection effects and distance uncertainties may still affect these results to some degree .",
    "nonetheless , the above results support the premise that the galaxies in x - ray bright groups have statistically lower   content and thereby higher   deficiency compared to the ones in non x - ray groups .    the bottom panel of fig .",
    "2 shows the cumulative distribution of radial distances from the group center for the two categories , xray - bright and non x - ray groups .",
    "the same three tests were performed on these distributions .",
    "probabilities that the two composite groups are drawn from the same parent distribution from ks , mw and ww tests are 0.08@xmath29 0.01@xmath30 and 33.6@xmath30 , respectively .",
    "clearly , the x - ray bright groups are more extended compared to the non x - ray bright groups .",
    "the average radius of the x - ray bright groups is 600 kpc while that of the non x - ray bright groups is 475 kpc .",
    "3 shows the plot of the group deficiency , as defined in section 2 , against the x - ray luminosity ( in log scale ) of the studied groups . in this figure , the   deficits of the nine all - spiral groups for which the x - ray luminosities are unknown , are marked at an x - ray luminosity ( @xmath31 in log scale ) of 39.0 .",
    "x - ray bright groups are represented with @xmath32 errorbars on both x and y values ; x - ray non - detected groups having upper limits in x - ray luminosity are shown with arrows pointing to the left . no dependence with x - ray luminosity",
    "is seen , excepting that x - ray bright groups are deficient and non x - ray groups have near normal  content .",
    "the fraction of galaxies according to the morphological type index for the two categories are shown in fig.4 .",
    "as noted in other instances ( mulchaey , 2003 ) , we also find that the x - ray bright groups have a larger fraction of early type galaxies compared to non x - ray groups .",
    "interestingly , the early type members are preferentially located close to the centers in the x - ray bright groups ( tables 3 & 4 ) .",
    "their exclusion in our analysis and the larger membership of the x - ray bright groups can possibly explain the finding that the x - ray bright groups are more extended than the non x - ray groups .",
    "environment affects substantially the gas content , star formation rate and morphology of a galaxy as demonstrated by studies of cluster galaxies .",
    "some observed properties of clusters viz .",
    "the population evolution with radius ie . from red , evolved and early type in the inner parts to bluer , younger and later type in the outer parts , the increase in the fraction of blue - galaxies ( _ butcher - oemler effect _ ; @xcite ) and decrease in the fraction of s0s ( _ morphological evolution _ ) with redshift , have led to considerations of mechanisms that change the star formation rate and morphology of cluster galaxies .",
    "removal of the warm gas from the halo ( _ strangulation _ ) and the cold - gas from the disk ( _ ram pressure stripping _ and _ evaporation via thermal conduction _ ) have been invoked to change the star formation rate .",
    "major and minor mergers have been invoked to account for the _ morphological evolution _ ( eg .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however , similarity in spectral and morphological properties of poor and more massive clusters at a redshift of @xmath120.25 @xcite and the level of suppression of star formation in galaxies in many clusters even at a radius of @xmath121 mpc are taken to imply _ pre - processing _ in _ sub - clusters _ :",
    "some of the warm gas from the halo and the cold gas from disk seem to be lost in processes in less massive clusters at a higher redshift that merged to form today s rich clusters . _",
    "strangulation , ram pressure _ and _ evaporation _ seem to be playing a role in them @xcite .",
    "interactions and mergers are processes that are likely to be similar in groups with and without diffuse x - ray emission . besides , tidal interactions are rare in group environments : for typical membership number ( 6 spirals ) , size ( 1.5 mpc diameter ) and dispersion ( 150 km / s ) of a group , the number of encounters for 50% gas loss is 0.03 for the group ( 0.005 per spiral galaxy ) in hubble time @xcite .",
    "therefore , the amount of gas lost in this way seems insufficient to explain the observed group deficiencies in x - ray bright groups .",
    "however , our study suggests that processes such as _ tidal aided ram pressure stripping _",
    "@xcite and _ evaporation via thermal conduction _ may be effective even among present day loose groups .",
    "our findings are : ( a ) the groups with diffuse x - ray emission seem to have lost more gas compared to groups without diffuse x - ray emission ; ( b ) the x - ray bright groups are spatially more extended than the non x - ray groups .",
    "these findings indicate a role for the x - ray emitting gas in aiding   removal from the galaxies",
    ".    in cluster environment ram pressure stripping has been seen to be an effective process for removing gas from galaxies . in groups",
    "this process was not considered to be an efficient one as lower igm density and velocity dispersion , both smaller by an order of magnitude compared to clusters , make direct ram pressure stripping effective only below a critical   column density of @xmath33 per @xmath34 for a normal galaxy with an optical radius of 10 kpc , and @xmath35 stars .",
    "however in x - ray bright groups this picture can be a little different . from the quoted x - ray luminosity and temperature in @xcite , we have calculated the igm densities assuming the emission to originate from thermal bremsstrahlung .",
    "the igm densities thus calculated for 10 x - ray bright groups vary from 5@xmath36 to 2@xmath37 . for a normal galaxy with an optical radius of 10 kpc and @xmath35 to @xmath38 stars , and for typical velocity dispersion quoted in the literature ,",
    "the ram pressure effects become important at   column densities @xmath12@xmath33 to @xmath12@xmath39 per @xmath34 .",
    "the range in stellar mass reflects the range in surface matter density .",
    "ram pressure becomes effective even at higher   column densities for low surface brightness galaxies .",
    "low surface brightness galaxies do form a substantial fraction in groups .",
    "the velocity dispersion of galaxies in these groups are also not well determined .",
    "recent discovery of several new members in ngc5044 , an x - ray bright group , indicates that some of these groups can actually be more massive . in ngc5044 ,",
    "the new membership has increased its velocity dispersion from 119 km / s to 431 km / s @xcite .",
    "for such a velocity dispersion and for a normal galaxy ( with an optical radius of 10 kpc , and @xmath35 to @xmath38 stars ) , the ram pressure effects are significant at   column densities of @xmath40 to @xmath41 per @xmath34 .",
    "we have calculated the maximum gas loss possible through ram pressure alone for two galaxies in ngc 5044 group .",
    "we have assumed a velocity dispersion of 431 km / s and an igm density of 4 particles / cc . the later is about half the igm density determined using x - ray data for this group @xcite .",
    "we chose two galaxies differing in stellar mass by a factor of ten to determine the varying effects of ram pressure on different types of galaxies in a group .",
    "we determined their stellar masses using their j and k magnitudes @xcite . in the first case of mcg-03 - 34 - 04",
    ", the stellar mass is found to be @xmath42 m@xmath43 , and the corresponding critical  column density beyond which the ram pressure can strip off gas is @xmath44 per @xmath34 . for a gaussian distribution of  @xcite and using a peak column density of @xmath45 per @xmath34 ( from our interferometric data ) , it is seen that @xmath5 5% of the gas can be stripped off in this way . in the second case , mcg-03 - 34 - 041",
    "is found to have a stellar content of @xmath46 m@xmath43 and a peak column density of @xmath47 per @xmath34 , leading to a gas loss of 32% .",
    "thus , ram pressure is probably an important gas removing mechanism in x - ray bright groups , either on its own or assisted by tidal interaction that stretches the gas below the critical column densities .",
    "however this is a density dependent mechanism and thus will be less efficient as the galaxy recedes the group centre , since the igm density will decrease with increasing distance from the centre . also for groups with smaller velocity dispersion ,",
    "this process will become much less effective as the ram pressure depends on the square of the velocity dispersion .",
    "for example , a galaxy like mcg-03 - 34 - 041 will lose only 5% gas if the velocity dispersion is 150 km / s .",
    "it may also be noted that for the ten x - ray bright groups for which we could determine the igm densities ( @xmath48 ) , the quantity , @xmath49 , is found to have no correlation with the group deficiency .",
    "evaporation via thermal conduction seems to be another process which can be responsible for mass loss from galaxies embedded in a hot medium @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that _ evaporation _ depends directly on temperature and weakly on density , complementary to ram pressure processes . at temperature of 5@xmath50 k , typical of an x - ray bright group ,",
    "a disk galaxy can loose as much as 4@xmath51 m@xmath43 in the time it takes to cross the central 100 kpc region at 200 km / s speed . to expell a mass of 10@xmath52 over a period of 10@xmath53 years",
    ", it requires a mechanical power input of about 10@xmath54 , a fraction of the luminosity of the x - ray bright groups .",
    "this suggests that if a small fraction of the thermal energy in the hot gas is coupled to the galactic cold gas over a billion years , the gas in the outer parts of the galaxies can be stripped leading to the observed deficit in .",
    "the saturation of conductivity and effects of magnetic field may reduce this mass loss .",
    "however , mixing from gas - dynamic instabilities as the disk ploughs through the tenuous igm may enhance the mass loss",
    ". evaporation may also become _ asymmetric _ caused by the galaxy motion and the gradient in the temperature and density of the hot gas .",
    "such asymmetric _ evaporation _ may further deposit momentum to the adjoining gas via ( spitzer s ) rocket effect and enhance the gas loss .",
    "numerical simulations of this process taking into account such effects may yield quantitative results and verify the viability of this mechanism . such an attempt is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we plan to enlarge the data set by obtaining single dish data on more groups , with and without diffuse x - ray emission .",
    "this will help us to improve the confidence level in these results .",
    "we are also in the process of obtaining high resolution images of some members from both kinds of groups , looking for morphological evidence to try to pin down the responsible process .",
    "extended , asymmetric , low surface brightness  distributions are typical signs of tidal interaction .",
    "swept - back appearence of the  gas along with the asymmetric structures , would suggest _ tidal aided ram pressure stripping_. evaporation will result in galaxies with somewhat smaller than usual  diameters , and a depressed  surface density across the entire face of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "thus , with sensitive synthesis data at moderate resolution , we hope to be able to assess the nature of gas removal and possibly conclude on the viable mechanism .",
    "we have studied the  content of galaxies in loose groups with and without diffuse x - ray emission .",
    "we find that the galaxies in non x - ray groups are not deficient in  with respect to the field galaxies .",
    "the galaxies in x - ray groups are clearly deficient in  and have lost more gas ( ) compared to those in non x - ray groups .",
    "no systematic dependence of the  deficiency with @xmath0 is found .",
    "we also find that the x - ray groups are more extended than non x - ray groups .",

    "<S> gas deficiency in cluster spirals is well known and ram - pressure stripping is considered the main gas removal mechanism . in some compact groups </S>",

    "<S> however , gas deficiency in loose groups is not yet well established . </S>",
    "<S> lower dispersion of the member velocities and the lower density of the intra - group medium in small loose groups favour tidal stripping as the main gas removal process in them . </S>",
    "<S> recent releases of data from  parkes all sky survey ( hipass ) and catalogues of nearby loose groups with associated diffuse x - ray emission have allowed us to test this notion . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we address the following questions : ( a ) do galaxies in groups with diffuse x - ray emission statistically have lower gas content compared to the ones in groups without diffuse x - ray emission ? ( b ) does  deficiency vary with the x - ray luminosity , @xmath0 , of the loose group in a systematic way ? we find that ( a ) galaxies in groups with diffuse x - ray emission , on average , are  deficient , and have lost more gas compared to those in groups without x - ray emission ; the later are found not to have significant  deficiency ; ( b ) no systematic dependence of the  deficiency with @xmath0 is found . </S>",
    "<S> ram pressure assisted tidal stripping and evaporation by thermal conduction are the two possible mechanisms to account for this excess gas loss .    </S>",
