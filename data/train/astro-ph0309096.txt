    "the barred - spiral galaxy ngc3783 ( @xmath3 mag . , @xmath4 ) hosts a well - studied , type - i active galactic nucleus ( agn ) with prominent broad emission lines and strong x - ray absorption features .",
    "the object has been observed extensively with almost all x - ray instruments , most recently by  ( kaspi et al .",
    "2002 , hereafter paper i ) and  ( blustin et al 2002 ) .",
    "the 210 kev flux of ngc3783 varies in the range @xmath5@xmath6  ^-2s^-1 ergs@xmath2s@xmath7 , and its mean 210 kev luminosity is @xmath8  ^-1 ergs s@xmath7  ( for @xmath9  kms@xmath7mpc@xmath7 and @xmath10 ) .",
    "paper i gives an extensive list of references and a comprehensive summary of historical observations , including ground - based and uv ( hst ) observations .",
    "it also discusses the unique  data set obtained in 20002001 .",
    "these observations consist of a relatively short observation performed in 2000 january , and five longer observations performed in 2001 february  june , separated by various intervals from 2 to 120 days ( see  2 ) .",
    "paper  i contains numerous illustrations of the mean spectrum , absorption line profiles and detailed measurements of many absorption and emission lines .",
    "two other papers ( gabel et al . 2003a , b ) discuss the _ hst _ and _ fuse _ data obtained as part of this multi - waveband campaign .",
    "there have been several previous attempts to model the characteristics of the x - ray absorbing gas along the line of sight to ngc3738 . here",
    "we comment only on the more detailed works .",
    "a very detailed work kaspi et al ( 2001 ) attempted to fit the spectrum obtained with  in 2000 .",
    "the kaspi et al .",
    "most successful model consists of two absorbing shells , both outflowing from the central source with a velocity of @xmath11 ^-1 kms@xmath7 .",
    "the gas in both shells was assumed to be turbulent with internal turbulent motion of @xmath12 ^-1 kms@xmath7 .",
    "the two shells had similar column densities , but different ionization parameters .",
    "the model is consistent with the intensity and equivalent width ( ew ) of many ( but not all ) emission and absorption lines observed in the spectrum . a major limitation of the kaspi et al .",
    "( 2001 ) work was the limited signal - to - noise ( s / n ) of the spectrum , which results in large uncertainties on the model parameters .",
    "in addition , the limited duration of the only observation then available did not allow a meaningful analysis of any time - dependence . a new paper , by krongold et al .",
    "( 2003 , hereafter k03 ) , discussing the full  data set , was accepted for publication after the submission of our paper .",
    "some results of that work are relevant to our study and are discussed in the various sections below .",
    "this paper discusses the complete spectroscopic  data of ngc3783 .",
    "we present our modeling of this material , with emphasis on the properties of the absorber(s ) along the line of sight . in ",
    "2 we describe the two x - ray spectral states discovered using the new observations . in ",
    "3 we explain the various ways we measured and modeled the spectrum .  4 contains a discussion of the new findings , and  5 summarizes our new results .",
    "a full description of the  data considered here is given in paper i. in brief , there were 5 observations ( each of @xmath13170  ks duration ) obtained over the period 2001 february  june , and a shorter observation ( of @xmath1356  ks duration ) obtained in 2000 january ( and also discussed in kaspi et al .",
    "all six observations were performed with the high - energy transmission grating spectrometer ( hetgs ) in place , and consist of a total exposure of 888.7 ks .",
    "all measurements in paper i refer to a time - averaged spectrum , produced by combining the first - order spectra from both grating arms , using 0.01  wide bins .",
    "third - order data from the medium - energy grating ( meg ) were also used to compare the profiles of several short - wavelength lines with the first - order profiles obtained for several lines at longer wavelength . it was found that most of the resolved absorption lines ( e.g. , and lines ) consist of at least two kinematic components , outflowing at @xmath14 ^-1 kms@xmath7  and @xmath15 ^-1 kms@xmath7  ( respectively ) .",
    "the overall absorption profiles in ngc3783 covers the velocity range of 0 to -1600 ^-1 kms@xmath7  ( e.g. see figs",
    ". 5 & 10 in paper i ) .",
    "a major goal of the present work is to investigate subsets of the  data .",
    "we subdivided the data in various ways to search for spectral variations as a function of source luminosity and/or time .",
    "this was done for both short ( i.e. within the individual 170 ks observations ) as well as for long ( between observations i.e. 2090 days ) time scales .",
    "the short time - scale behavior of ngc3783 is illustrated in fig.1 which shows the short wavelength ( 210   ) flux as a function of time for all observations binned in intervals of 3170 sec in the left panels .",
    "the right panels shows the `` softness '' ratio , defined as the flux in the 1525  band divided by that in the 210    band , to illustrate now the different variability characteristics exhibited by the source above and below @xmath131  kev .        from fig .",
    "1 it can be seen that the 210    flux varied by about 50% over the 170 ks duration of each of the observations . however ,",
    "inspection of the corresponding softness light curves shows that the spectral variations are much smaller and almost insignificant .",
    "thus , the data show very little cahnges of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) over time scales @xmath164  days ( `` obsids '' 2090 and 2091 are consecutive with total duration of about 4 days ) . to further test this finding ,",
    "we have also extracted various spectra when the source was in different intensity states , but did not find any significant spectral variations during this period .",
    "we also note that behar et al .",
    "( 2003 ) did not find any spectral variations during a three - day observation of ngc 3783 in 2001 december using .",
    "contrary to the above , there is a _ very significant _ change of sed on longer time scales . in particular",
    ", there is a major change in the softness ratio between obsids 2092 and 2093 ( separated by 20 days ) and obsids 2093 and 2094 ( separated by 90 days ) . as shown in fig .",
    "1 , obsid 2093 shows a higher mean count rate but exhibits a much softer spectrum . direct comparison of the time - averaged spectra obtained during obsid 2093 with that obtained during obsid 2094 reveals the low energy part ( @xmath17 ) decreased in flux by a factor of @xmath18 , but that the shorter wavelength continuum exhibited a much smaller decrease ( factor @xmath0 ) the opposite change occured between obsids 2092 and 2093 .",
    "most importantly , the softness ratio variations _ are not _ simple luminosity - related effects . for example , the 210    count rate in the middle of obsid 2093 ( fig .",
    "1 ) is a little lower than the 210    flux toward the end of obsid 2094 , yet the softness ratios are significantly different .",
    "a similar effect is seen in obsid 2093 , during which the 210    count rate varied by about 50% yet the softness ratio remaining approximately constant .",
    "in light of these results , we have divided the entire data set into groups with high and low softness ratios . we find four observations ( 2090 , 2091 , 2092 and 2094 ) with low softness ratio and two ( 0373 and 2093 ) with high softness ratio .",
    "hereafter we refer to these as the `` low- '' and `` high - state '' observations , respectively .",
    "we find no significant differences between the mean spectra of the four individual low - state observations ( except for a small intensity variations ) .",
    "similarly we find no significant differences between the mean spectral shapes of the two high - state observations .",
    "2 is a more detailed example of this phenomenon .",
    "it shows the softness ratio as a function of the 210    flux for all the data using 3170s bins .",
    "a separation into two groups is apparent , and a standard ks statistical test confirms its significance .",
    "we have also investigated possible linear correlations of the softness ratio with the 210    flux within each of the states .",
    "for the low - state observations , we find a significant ( @xmath19% ) linear correlation between softness ratio and flux .",
    "however , as can be seen from fig.2 , clearly this line does not connect the low- and high - state data .",
    "no significant correlation of softness ratio with flux was found for the high - state data .",
    "we conclude that the x - ray spectrum of ngc3783 fluctuates between two states of different softness ratio .",
    "the combined spectra of the two are shown in fig .",
    "3 and much of the rest of this paper is devoted to the analysis of this unusual behavior of ngc3783 .",
    "we have investigated the unusual variations observed in the spectrum of ngc3783 in an attempt to understand their nature and their origin .",
    "in particular , we have attempted to answer the question of whether they are due to the response of the absorbing gas to the variations observed in the continuum .",
    "there are two ways to answer the above question  by a direct and detailed spectral comparison , and by modeling the two spectra trying to establish the origin of the differences .",
    "4 is an example of the first approach .",
    "the diagrams shows a comparison of the low- and high - state spectra after applying a simple scaling factor to the former such that the ( local ) continua have the same intensity .",
    "as the scaling factor is wavelength dependent , we divided the two spectra into several bands and applied different factors in each case .",
    "the two examples shown in fig . 4 ( and all others we have examined ) illustrate that , except for a luminosity scaling , the two absorption line spectra are indistinguishable within the uncertainties ( @xmath1310% for the low - state spectrum and about twice that for the high - state spectrum )",
    ". the somewhat weaker looking lines of low ionization species in the high - state spectrum ( e.g. around 7 ) are well within the noise .",
    "table 1 lists the ews measured for several key absorption lines ( see  3.2.3 ) in both the high- and low - state spectra .",
    "again , the small differences between the two spectra are well within the measurement errors .",
    "we proceed under the assumption that there are no variations in the line ews between the two states .",
    "we comment on the implications of this in  4.1 .",

    "the underlying idea is that the gas is photoionized by the central x - ray source , and that the observed spectra represent its physical state during the two states .",
    "the principles and the ingredients of such modeling were outlined in netzer ( 1996 ) and previous applications to the case of ngc3783 were discussed by kaspi et al .",
    "a very recent analysis is provided by k03 who describe a detailed model composed of two absorbers that are different from those suggested by kaspi et al .",
    "below we comment on the similarity and differences between our work and the new k03 paper . here",
    "we summarize our basic method and explain its application to the high and the low - state spectra of ngc3783 .",
    "the x - ray gas is assumed to be photoionized by a central source , and in photoionization and thermal equilibrium ( see  4 for discussion of the last point ) .",
    "modeling was performed using ion2003 , the 2003 version of the code ion ( netzer 1996 ) .",
    "the code includes all relevant atomic processes , and computes the ionization and thermal structure of the gas along with the intensities and ews for more than 2000 x - ray lines .",
    "the code is able to consider various geometries , from a single cloud to a multi - component , expanding atmosphere .",
    "the basic parameters of the model are the gas density ( assumed to be in the range 10@xmath56 @xmath57 - see justification in  4 ) , the hydrogen column density ( @xmath58 , in units of @xmath2 ) , the covering factor , the gas composition , turbulent motion (  3.2.2 ) and the oxygen ionization parameter ( @xmath59 ) defined over the energy range 0.5410 kev . as explained by netzer ( 1996 ) , and discussed further in george et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , this choice of ionization parameter ( compared with , for example , @xmath60 defined over the 0.110 kev range ) gives the most meaningful definition of the ionization field of x - ray photons for agn .",
    "regarding the covering factor , we distinguish between the emission covering factor ( @xmath61 ) applicable to the emission line gas , and the absorption ( line of sight ) covering factor which can be different .",
    "the `` solar composition '' used throughout this work is given in table 2 ( note the reduced oxygen abundance compared with older estimates ) .",

( 2001 , table 4 ) .",
    "the only changes we have experimented with are related to the slope of the 0.150 kev continuum .",
    "as discussed below , the uv part of the spectrum can be different from the one assumed here with important implications for the uv absorption lines .",
    "this will be investigated in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the effects of the uv continuum on the strongest features seen in the x - ray band are of far less importance .",
    "thus we consider this sed to be adequate for the present analysis .",
    "the models calculated here are entirely self - consistent and are not simple attempts to fit the observed spectra by measuring line ews and deducing column densities for the different ions .",
    "we have searched for the combination of physical components that can be produced in nature in an environment where low density gas is exposed to a typical agn continuum .",
    "these components were then combined in a realistic manner , taking into account screening , attenuation of the radiation field , etc .",
    "we have examined the hypothesis that the spectral changes observed arise purely as a result of variations in the opacity of the absorbing gas which are caused solely by changes in the intensity of the ionizing continuum .",
    "thus , for this experiment , we assume the shape of the seds is the same for both the low- and high - states and only differ in total luminosity .",
    "we start by calculating a variety of models in order to mimic the low - state spectrum .",
    "each model is made of several emission and absorption components .",
    "the absorbers are specified by @xmath59 , @xmath58 and the absorption ( i.e. line of sight ) covering factor .",
    "the latter is assumed to be the same for all absorbers ( but see also  4 ) .",
    "the absorbers are assumed to be aligned such that the observed spectrum is the result of the intrinsic continuum passing through them all .",
    "the emission components are specified by their @xmath59 and @xmath58 ( that are not necessarily the same as those of the absorbers ) , their covering factor and whether or not they are occulted by the absorbing gas .",
    "the dynamics and kinematics of the absorbing gas are important factors in comparing the data with the model . following numerous uv observations , and our analysis in paper i",
    ", we assumed internal motion in the gas which is much larger than the thermal motion .",
    "this `` turbulent velocity '' is assumed to have a doppler profile and the velocity quoted is the doppler @xmath73 parameter .",
    "paper i showed that _ all absorption lines _ with good s / n and sufficient resolution ( the lines of , , and ) can be characterized by two kinematic components .",
    "the central velocities of these are between -400 and -600 ^-1 kms@xmath7  and between -1000 and -1300 ^-1 kms@xmath7 , relative to the systemic velocity .",
    "a good representation of the observations can be obtained with two doppler profiles each with @xmath74 ^-1 kms@xmath7 .",
    "the relative ew and covering factor of the two velocity components are critical to our modeling of the source .",
    "the observations show that the ew ratio of the velocity components is about 1:0.7 ( lower : higher ) in all lines with sufficient s / n ( see below ) .",
    "since this ratio is seen in several saturated lines , it can be interpreted as the result of different absorption covering factors for each component . in this case",
    ", the lower - velocity component has a covering factor of 0.81.0 and the larger - velocity component a covering factor of 0.60.8 .",
    "however , the composite profiles also include unsaturated lines that seem to have similar shapes . in this case , the different ews are due to different column densities .",
    "we can not distinguish between the two possibilities since we do not have high - quality , high - resolution profiles for many weak lines .",
    "given these uncertainties , we investigated two cases where the relative column densities for the two velocity components are in the ratio of 1:0.7 . in one case the covering factor of all absorbers is unity and in the other case it is of order 0.8 .",
    "in summary , each ionization component of the models presented in this paper is made of two kinematic components .",
    "for the outflow velocities we chose -500 and -1000 ^-1 kms@xmath7 , and assumed a turbulent velocity of 250 ^-1 kms@xmath7  for all components .",
    "this implies that the total derived column density of a certain ionization component is _ the sum _ of the column densities in the two kinematic components , even for saturated lines ( since there is very little velocity overlap between the two ) .",
    "for brevity , in the rest of this paper we just quote the total column densities . given these assumptions , we used the ews measured in paper i , combined with a few new measurements , to obtain the various column densities and optical depths .",
    "the more important lines that were used to constrain our models , and their adopted column densities , are listed in table 3 .",

    "this wavelength range contains lines from to as well as the strongest lines of and .",
    "most of these lines are not blended .",
    "the range of ionization and excitation is very large and represents the ionization of almost all line - producing ions in the  spectrum .",
    "the column densities deduced from these ews , assuming the two component profiles , are given in tables 1 & 3 .",
    "the atomic data for the lines are known either from standard calculations ( f - values for the h - like and he - like transitions ) or from the recent work of behar and netzer ( 2002 ) discussing the inner - shell lines of silicon , sulphur and other elements .",
    "we have developed a simple algorithm to compare the measured optical depths of all the observed silicon and sulphur lines with the results of the photoionization calculations .",
    "we first compute a large grid of models with calculated optical depths for a large range of ionization parameters and column densities .",
    "we then pick up to four models at a time and compare the _ combined _ optical depth for the chosen set of lines with the values deduced from the observations for the larger column density ( lower outflow velocity ) kinematic component .",
    "the best combination of models is obtained by minimizing the differences between the observed and the calculated optical depths in all 10 lines ( the 9 silicon and sulphur lines listed in table 1 plus a line of ) .",
    "the result is a list of up to four models , with various column density and @xmath59 , whose combination gives the best match to the observed column densities . using this procedure",
    "we find that at least three ionization components ( i.e. six kinematic components ) are required to fit the data to within the observational accuracy .",
    "the reason is the very large difference in ionization between the lowest ( e.g. and ) and the highest ( e.g. ) ionization lines .",
    "this requires at least one component to fit the ews of the lowest ionization lines , one to fit the intermediate ionization lines and one for the highest ionization lines .",
    "experimenting with various modifications of the method suggests that there are several combinations of three or four ionization components that give similar quality fits to the observed optical depths of the silicon and sulphur lines .",
    "all combinations share the same general properties  they all require at least three very different sets of physical conditions ( i.e. ionization parameters ) and three similar column densities .",
    "a generic model with the required properties is the following three - component model ( all column densities refer to the total column of the two kinematic components ) : a low ionization component with log@xmath124 and log@xmath125 , a medium ionization component with log@xmath126 and log@xmath127 , and a high ionization component with log@xmath128 and log@xmath129 .",
    "the uncertainties on @xmath59 and @xmath58 in the case of the low ionization component arise primarily from the uncertainty on the slope of the ionizing continuum .",
    "relaxing this constraint allows a somewhat smaller column density ( see  3.2.4 ) .",
    "the larger uncertainties on the parameters of the higher ionization components are due to the fact that gas with such properties produce similar ews for medium ( e.g. ) and high ( e.g. ) ionization lines over a larger range of ionization parameters and column densities .",
    "the three theoretical ionization components are plotted over a large wavelength range in fig . 5 , and a more detailed view of the 4.57    range",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "6 .",
    "the next step is to test the combination of components that fit the optical depths of the 57.1    silicon and sulphur ions best over other wavelength bands .",
    "this requires the shape of the underlying ionizing continuum to be defined more precisely .",
    "the slope of the short wavelength continuum can be measured directly if bound - free absorption is negligible",
    ". however , fig .",
    "5 clearly shows that two of the generic absorbers are characterized by large opacity at wavelengths as short as 45   .",
    "thus a unique determination of the 25  continuum slope ( the part available for the grating observations ) is not trivial .",
    "more specifically , the exact column density in the lowest - ionization component strongly influences the short wavelength continuum shape , and the uncertainty on this column gives rises to an uncertainty on the slope",
    ".    given the above constraints on the model properties , and the observed 25    continuum , we have experimented with various power - law continua with the requirement that both the short wavelength continuum and the measured ews of the silicon and sulphur lines , are within the observational uncertainties .",
    "all fits were performed on the low - state spectrum .",
    "we found that a single power - law ( where the number of photons per unit energy , @xmath130 , is proportional to @xmath131 ) with @xmath132 is a good overall representation of the low - state spectrum .",
    "we note that the limited data quality can not exclude the possibility of some steepening of the intrinsic continuum at long ( @xmath133 ) wavelengths .",
    "we note in passing the different continuum slope adopted by k03 in their recent modeling of the source .",
    "these authors did not consider the two spectral states found here and fitted the full  data set . as a result , the sed they adopted is based on the combined ( high- and low- state ) spectrum , and hence is different from ours .",
    "this is also the reason why their powerlaw slope is flatter than the one adopted by kaspi et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , who fitted the high state only .",
    "k03 also include in their sed a low - energy blackbody component .    another uncertainty on the intrinsic sed arises from the fact that some of the high energy photons are likely to be produced far away from the source , due to compton scattering and reflection of the central continuum radiation .",
    "this can be very noticeable in faint sources , like ngc3516 during 2000 ( see netzer et al .",
    "scattering by gas in a low state of ionization is strongly wavelength dependent , and for ngc3783 can amount to a change of @xmath134 in the derived value of @xmath135 . as a result",
    ", we might have overestimated the column density of the lowest ionization component ( the only component with significant influence on the slope of the short wavelength continuum ) which would results in overestimating the column densities of low ionization species such as and . ",
    "4.1 contains some discussion about the lowering of the column density in our low @xmath59 component and a more detailed examination of this effect is deferred to a separate paper ( george et al .",
    "2003 , in preparation ) .",
    "finally , a broad , relativistic iron k@xmath136 line can also be important in affecting the short wavelength continuum slope .",
    "the presence or absence of such a feature is an open question .",
    "kaspi et al .",
    "( 2001 ) see no evidence for this feature in the 2000  observation .",
    "given the uncertainties discussed above , and the large amount of absorption at almost all wavelengths , we can not resolve this issue even with our much improved data .",
    "given the chosen continuum and the three ionization components , we have calculated a combined multi - component model that covers the entire wavelength range . as stated above , the model includes two kinematic components for every ionization component .",
    "the theoretical spectrum is compared with the observed low - state spectrum in fig .",
    "the results are very good .",
    "in fact , we could not find another combination of models ( three or more absorbers ) that is significantly superior .",
    "not only does the model provide a good overall fit to many lines of all elements , but it also predicts the strengths of the deep bound - free edges correctly .",
    "thus , the constraints on the 57.1    silicon and sulphur lines are enough to completely specify a model for the entire spectrum .",
    "as demonstrated above , the low - state absorption spectrum of ngc3783 can be satisfactorily explained by our combination of line - of - sight absorbers .",
    "the agreement with the observations is very good for all lines with @xmath137 .",
    "however , there is a noticeable discrepancy at around 16 . at this wavelength range",
    "there are two main sources of opacity  the bound - free continuum ( edge at 16.7 ) , and the iron m - shell uta feature ( behar , sako & kahn 2001 ) .",
    "our photoionization calculations suggest a disagreement between the two in the sense that the strongest iron lines observed are due to ions indicative of a lower level of ionization than that indicated by the strongest oxygen lines observed .",
    "specifically , the peak uta absorption corresponds to . for such a level of ionization , our models predict most of the oxygen being in the form of . however , the observations indicate that most of the oxygen bound - free absorption is due to .",
    "the possible origin of this discrepancy is discussed in  4 .",
    "regarding the spectrum beyond @xmath138 , the comparison between the model and the observations is limited by the poorer s / n . while the model shown in fig .",
    "7 is consistent with the data , the predicted depths of several absorption lines in this range ( in particular those due to and ) seem to be stronger than actually observed .",
    "this may be a real shortcoming of the model ( see comments in  3.2.4 and in  4 ) .",
    "it may also be the result of the assumed absorption covering factor .",
    "as already mentioned , line - profile analysis suggest a mean ( over the line profile ) covering factor of 0.71.0 , and all models considered so far assumed the extreme case of an absorption covering factor of unity .",
    "the `` leakage '' of the incident continuum makes little difference at short wavelengths except for a need to somewhat decrease the assumed @xmath135 .",
    "however , leakage can influence the comparison at long wavelengths much more .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "8 which shows a model with @xmath139 and a line - of - sight covering factor of 0.85 .",
    "indeed , the agreement at long wavelengths is much better .",
    "the differences between the two assumed slopes and covering factors are well within the model uncertainties .",
    "we have attempted to model the high - state spectrum by assuming the same ionization components and by changing the luminosity and the ionization parameter by the factor inferred from the observed increased luminosity in the short wavelength continuum ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "the result is a very poor fit to the long wavelength continuum luminosity and to the intensities of many lines .",
    "the reason is that such a small luminosity change results in an opacity change which is too small to account for the very large difference ( factor @xmath18 ) between the low and the high state spectra at long wavelengths .",
    "this means that the high and the low state spectra are inconsistent with the assumption of a simple response of the gas to continuum luminosity variations .    there is a simple and satisfactory solution for the high - state spectrum that involves the appearance of an additional continuum component",
    "this second , long wavelength component ( sometimes referred to as a `` soft excess '' ) appears only during high state .",
    "we have therefore modeled the high - state continuum by two powerlaws : the low - state power law ( @xmath140 ) and a steeper component with @xmath141 which dominates at long wavelengths .",
    "we find a satisfactory solution for the high - state spectrum when the @xmath141 component emits 40% of the flux of the @xmath140 component at 12.398    ( 1 kev ) .",
    "( we note that this is not a unique combination , and fits of similar quality can be obtained for other combinations of slope and normalization . )",
    "the two continua are shown in fig .",
    "3 , along with the high and the low state spectra . given the two component continuum , we find a very good agreement for the high - state line and continuum spectrum by assuming _ no opacity variations_. the quality of the fit is similar to the low - state fits shown in figs .",
    "to further illustrate this point in fig .",
    "9 we show the high - state spectrum divided by the low - state spectrum ( binned to reduce the noise ) along with the ratio of the two assumed continua .",
    "the diagram shows that any remaining spectral features are entirely consistent with the noise .",
    "the s / n in this diagram is not high enough to completely rule out some opacity - like variations at long wavelengths . in particular , there is some excess emission near the and recombination edges that may hint to extra emission in the high - state spectrum ( note that we do not expect the emission features to disappear by this division ) .",
    "however , such opacity variations must contribute very little to the spectral variations observed at long wavelengths .",
    "finally , the emission - line spectrum of ngc3783 can be explained by assuming x - ray emitters with the same properties found for the ionized absorbers .",
    "the emitted line photons are probably observed through the absorber , as indicated by the combined emission - absorption profiles of several resonance lines .",
    "the model is problematic at around 21.8 , where it fails to reproduce the intercombination emission line .",
    "the emission covering factor required is about 0.1 ( see  4.1 ) consistent with the value of approximately 0.050.15 obtained by behar et al .",
    "this section discusses the main results of the new analysis of all the observations of ngc3783 performed to date .",
    "the reader is referred also to an appendix where we give a detailed comparison with the recent work of krongold et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "the main new findings of our work are the large increase in flux between the low- and high - states , which is _ not _ accompanied by any significant changes in the properties of the absorption .",
    "the central source in ngc3783 fluctuates between two such flux states on a 20120 days time scale , and the best description of the observed variations is the appearance and disappearance of a `` soft excess '' , low energy continuum component .",
    "these lead to important conclusions regarding the nature of the continuum source .",
    "other important conclusions are the multi - component nature of the absorber and the large range of ionization .",
    "below we discuss some interpretations .",
    "we found that three ionization components with different properties and a large range of ionization , are required to fit the spectrum of ngc3783 .",
    "each of those components is split into two kinematic components , as implied by the observed line profiles reported in paper  1 .",
    "the three `` generic absorbers '' of our model are listed in table 4 and shown in figs .",
    "5 & 6 . as explained above , the number of real components and the exact values of @xmath59 and @xmath58 are not very meaningful since several somewhat different combinations of ionization components give equally good fits .",
    "rather , the values chosen here are representative , `` average '' ionization parameters , and the total column densities required .",
    "our modeling of the low - state spectrum assumes the underlying x - ray continuum is a single power - law .",
    "however , the s / n of the long wavelength spectrum is not high enough to completely rule out the presence of an additional softer continuum component , similar to the one seen during the high states but of much lower luminosity .",
    "we also note that there is little ( if any ) response of the absorbing gas to the short ( @xmath142 days ) time scale continuum variations .",
    "thus our measurements are models represent some time - averaged spectral properties .",
    "ccc low ionization & -2.4 & 21.9 + intermidiate ionization & -1.2 & 22.0 + high ionization & -0.6 & 22.3 +    the main difference between the present model and the one given by kaspi et al .",
    "( 2001 ) is the presence of the lowest ionization component . only the first  observation ( obtained in 2000 january ) was available to kaspi et al .",
    ", and hence was insufficient to reveal the two spectral states .",
    "furthermore , this relatively short observation resulted in the s / n at @xmath143  which was insufficient to reveal the true shape of the continuum .",
    "hence kaspi et al .",
    "naturally ( but incorrectly ) assumed the underlying continuum was a single power - law for this high - state spectrum . as a result , their preferred model contained a component with a strong bound - free edge , but very little absorption at longer wavelengths ( i.e. at @xmath143  the underlying continuum was `` recovered '' ) .",
    "our new observations do not show such a recovery .",
    "in fact , the absorption in the long wavelength region is dominated by features of k - shell carbon and nitrogen and l - shell nitrogen and oxygen .",
    "the presence of a lower ionization component is also a key point in the k03 work . in their study",
    "they assume two absorbers with log@xmath144 ( i.e. a factor of about two lower than our lowest ionization component ) and log@xmath145 ( very similar to our imtermediate ionization component ) .",
    "their fit does not require a third , very ionized component .",
    "our reason for suggesting this higest - ionization ( log@xmath146 ) component is based on the fit to the lines of , and .",
    "when this component is not included , the discrepancy in column densities of these ions is a factor 23 .",
    "several of the lines of these ions are in fact missing from the k03 analysis .",
    "moreover , some of the highest -ionization lines are badly saturated , ( e.g. @xmath147 ) .",
    "thus a comparison of the observed and the calculated ews of those lines , as performed by k03 , is not sufficient for evaluating the ionic column densities .    perhaps the largest observed discrepancy between model and observation is due to absorption by the iron m - shell uta .",
    "this feature has been observed in several other agn ( steenbrugge et al .",
    "2003 and references therein ) with similar shape and central wavelength .",
    "its smooth shape is due to the large number of absorption lines of many iron ions and the wavelength of largest absorption is ionization dependent .",
    "our modeling of this spectral region includes all the lines in the behar et al .",
    "( 2001 ) calculations ( i.e. not only the shorter published list of lines ) .",
    "the central observed wavelength of the feature in ngc3783 is at around 16.4  suggesting that most of the contribution is due to . for the assumed sed , this corresponds to gas whose dominant oxygen ions are . in our modeling , most long wavelength absorption is due to the component with log@xmath148 ( fig .",
    "the dominant ions in this components are  and . this corresponds to peak uta opacity at around 16.1 .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "7 , the model fits the observed oxygen lines and continua reasonably well but badly misses the position of the uta absorption .",
    "we have experimented with various other models to try to eliminate this discrepancy .",
    "for example , an overabundance of iron relative to oxygen may decrease the level of ionization of iron due to the increased iron opacity .",
    "experimenting with iron abundance which is three times larger resulted with changes that are not large enough to explain the observed discrepancy .",
    "we have also experimented with models that include several low ionization components , instead of the single low @xmath59 component shown here .",
    "this , again , gave very little improvement .",
    "it seems that the apparent conflict between the oxygen and iron ionization can not be resolved by these models and we suggest two alternative explanations .    1",
    ".   the absorbing gas in ngc3783 may not be in ionization equilibrium due to its low density and the rapid flux variations on time scales that are shorter than the recombination and ionization time scales .",
    "this is probably not very important for the short wavelength flux since its variability time scale is short and the amplitude not very large .",
    "the gas responding to this continuum is probably at some mean level of ionization .",
    "this however is not the case for the soft excess continuum which varies on a much longer time scale with a much larger amplitude .",
    "this can contribute , significantly , to the ionization of the lower ionization species .",
    "different ions react on different time scales and the gas may never reach an equilibrium . since all our models assume steady state gas , they may not be adequate to describe the absorbing gas properties . in particular , the iron and oxygen recombination times may be different enough to result in gas where iron is less ionized or oxygen is more ionized compared to the equilibrium situation .",
    "the complicated issue of time dependent ionization is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "2 .   the ionization balance of iron depends critically on low temperature dielectronic recombination ( dr ) rates that are not well known for the iron m - shell ions .",
    "experience with l - shell iron ions , whose dr rates have been measured and computed recently ( savin et al .",
    "2002 and references therein ) , shows that in almost all cases the previous low temperature dr rates were consistently smaller than the newly calculated values . assuming a similar effect in the m - shell ions",
    ", we can envisage a situation where , in the absence of realistic dr rate , the entire ionization balance of iron is shifted toward higher ionization .",
    "thus , more realistic low temperature dr rates may bring models to better agreement with the observations .",
    "we note that low temperature dr rates are also not available for the magnesium and silicon ions that we have modeled . for some of these ions ( and )",
    "these are probably not very important and for others ( the relevant silicon ions ) the situation is less clear ( d. savin , private communication but see also gu 2003 ) .",
    "nevertheless , since we do obtain good agreement between the calculated ews of these lines and the ews of other lines observed in the spectrum , we did not consider changing those rates in the calculations .",
    "it is interesting to note that the k03 model assumes a lower level of ionization for all elements , including iron , and hence provides a better fit to the uta .",
    "however , their lower ionization component fails to fit the and lines around 6.8 .",
    "our model was designed to give a very good fit over the 57   wavelength range and hence produces a lower quality fit to the uta feature .",
    "thus , there seem to be no satisfactory solution based on a single low - ionization component that explains all these features .",
    "an interesting and somewhat problematic issue is the abundance of , which can also be clearly observed in the far uv ( gabel et al .",
    "2003a ; gabel et al . , 2003b ) .",
    "paper i found even the k@xmath136 line of undetectable with the current s / n .",
    "however , revisiting this measurement more carefully , and with more accurate atomic data , we can now detect several lines . from two such lines ,",
    "both of which are probably saturated , we have obtained a lower limit of @xmath149 @xmath2 on the column density of .",
    "this is much higher than the value ( @xmath150 @xmath2 ) obtained from the  rgs spectrum ( behar et al .",
    "moreover , the values predicted from our model ( @xmath151 @xmath2 ) is even larger .",
    "such a large value is problematic for several reasons .",
    "it may be in contradiction with the uv observations of the source ( see below ) , it is much larger than the values obtained from the rgs observations , and it results in a prediction of a strong absorption line at around 21.87    which is not seen in the spectrum ( fig .",
    "7 , the absorption line underneath the intercombination line ) .",
    "an explanation of the discrepancy between the values for the column density measured by  and   is the crowded region of the spectrum where k@xmath136 resides . in particular",
    ", the lower spectral resolution of the  rgs makes it extremely difficult to resolve the weak absorption line at 22.01    in the presence of the bright forbidden emission line ( 22.10   ) .",
    "we also wish to note that with the lack of laboratory measurements for the wavelengths , high - resolution astrophysical spectra such as the present one constitute the best determination of these wavelengths currently available .",
    "the  data , along with the assumption that is outflowing at the same velocity as , places the k@xmath136 line at a rest - wavelength of 22.01  @xmath152  0.01   .",
    "this value is in agreement with our model wavelength of 22.005   , calculated with the hullac atomic code , as well as with the value measured in ngc  5548 ( steenbrugge et al . , 2003 ) , but is somewhat different from the value of 22.05    calculated by pradhan ( 2000 ) using the r - matrix method . for more information see behar and kahn ( 2002 ) .",
    "a column density less than @xmath153 @xmath2 is also inconsistent with theoretical predictions based on modelling the abundances of , and .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "10 where we show calculations for the fractional abundance of oxygen , silicon and magnesium ions as a function of @xmath59 assuming an incident continuum similar to the one used here .",
    "the diagram shows the very similar fractional abundance of , and as a function of ionization parameter . using the measured ew of the @xmath154 line , which is an unblended , easy - to - measure feature",
    ", we can use fig .",
    "10 , and the assumed silicon - to - oxygen abundance ratio , to derive an estimate for the column density of .",
    "this number is very close to the model prediction .",
    "the situation is more complicated regarding magnesium since several of the relevant lines ( around 9.4 ) are blended with neon lines .",
    "however , we could obtain an estimate of the ew of the @xmath155 lines that are good enough to constrain the column density . the column density based on this measurement",
    "is , again , much larger than @xmath153 @xmath2 and in good agreement with the model prediction .",
    "a comparison with the k03 work shows a disagreement by a factor of two in the total ( hydrogen ) column density of the lowest - ionization absorber .",
    "one reason for the difference is that k03 analyse the combined ( high- and low - state ) spectrum , which is then interpreted in terms of a different amount of bound - free absorption .",
    "another reason is the somewhat larger oxygen abundance assumed by k03 ( the oxygen column densities of the low - ionization components in the two papers actually differ only by a factor 1.35 ) .",
    "we also note that the inner - shell lines that we have used to determine the limit on the column density of this ion are missing from the k03 model .",
    "this makes a noticeable difference in the spectral fitting at around 21 .",
    "finally , we have looked for the lowest column density allowed by the observations if we remove the constraint imposed by the short wavelength continuum slope (  3.2.4 ) and keep the ionization parameter unchanged .",
    "this means finding the lowest column density for the log(@xmath59)=-2.4 component which is still consistent with the measured ews of the 57.1    silicon and sulphur lines .",
    "we found this limit to be log(@xmath156 for the low - state spectrum , and log(@xmath157 for the high - state spectrum .",
    "these lower limits on the column densities are consistent with the uncertainties given in table 1 . under these assumptions ,",
    "the column density of in the low - state spectrum can be as low as @xmath158 @xmath2 .",
    "this column is large enough to produce saturated lines at 21.01 and 21.87   .",
    "it also requires a much harder continuum ( @xmath159 ) .",
    "some of the parameters our model are based on measured profiles of several absorption lines that were shown in paper i to include at least two components with different ouflow velocities .",
    "the measurements in paper i also show that the relative ews of the two components seems to be ionization independent and that most of the lines used for the profile analysis were heavily saturated .",
    "this suggests that the apparent optical depths of those lines are determined by the covering factor rather than the line opacity , and hence similar to the case seen in many uv absorption systems in agn ( e.g. barlow , hamann & sargent 1997;arav et al .",
    "the covering factor of the lower - velocity components of the , and lines is in the range 0.81.0 .",
    "the covering factor of the larger - velocity component of the same lines , assuming saturated profiles , is 0.60.8 .",
    "we also note that the large number of iron lines near the uta center gives an independent estimate of the covering factor which is at least 0.85 .",
    "8 shows that models with a covering factor less than unity provide fits to the data of similar quality . using the silicon and sulphur lines ( as in  3.2.3 ) , we find three ionization components are again required , each with parameters similar to those listed in table 4 . the only difference is the need to assume a somewhat harder ionizing continuum .",
    "the fit to the long wavelength lines is in fact somewhat better than that produced by the full covering models .",
    "however given the low s / n at those wavelengths , this is not a strong conclusion .",
    "thus , the data - model comparison can not constrain covering factor beyond the actual observations .",
    "the most important conclusion is that the covering factor is similar in low ( e.g. and the iron uta ) and in high ( e.g. , ) ionization lines .",
    "our measurements and analysis are consistent with no variations in the absorbers properties on time scales of 14 days .",
    "there are also indications for no spectral changes over much longer periods , perhaps a few months .",
    "for instance we find no evidence for any significant , narrow ( @xmath160 1   ) spectral features in the high- to low - state spectral ratio shown in fig.9 .",
    "the reason we can not constrain the variability of the absorbers on short time - scales are the fast , relatively - small amplitude fluctuations in the luminosity of the central source ( maximum amplitude of about a factor 2 ) . as a result of these variability characteristics of the illuminating continuum , the lack of significant spectral variations may be due to the ionization level of the gas reflecting the _ time averaged _ ionizing luminosity , rather than very long ionization or recombination times .",
    "this conclusion therefore depends primarily on the direct comparison between the low and the high state spectra , and thus on the s / n in the lower - quality spectrum used for the comparison ( the high state spectrum ) .    to further examine this point ,",
    "we have calculated the theoretical spectrum appropriate for the high state continuum under the assumption that the absorbing gas responds instantly to changes in the ionizing continuum .",
    "this would be the case if the gas along the line - of - sight gas were of very high density .",
    "the initial conditions are those assumed for the low - state continuum , and the change in the sed as described earlier : a two component x - ray continuum , where the long - wavelength component is assumed to extrapolate down to 40  ev .",
    "the increase in flux between the low- and high states was assumed to be a factor 1.5 at 4    ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . fig .",
    "11 shows two theoretical spectra : the low - state spectrum ( in blue ) is the same model shown in fig .",
    "7 , the high state spectrum ( in red ) is the result of these new calculations .",
    "the two are clearly different .",
    "in particular the , and lines are are much weaker for the high - state model .",
    "this is due to the large increase in flux at longest wavelengths , with the largest consequences for the lowest ionization component ( @xmath59 has increased by a factor close to 2 and @xmath60 by a factor of 6.6 ) .",
    "the variations predicted by this theoretical exercise are much larger than those observed ( table 1 and fig .",
    "4 ) . this illustrates the gas did not simply react to the differences in the illuminating continuum between the low- and high - states .",
    "an even stronger conclusion is obtained from the fact that at long wavelengths the differences observed between the two states are much larger than can be explained by simple variations in opacity .",
    "given the above findings , we can place limits on the electron density ( @xmath161 ) and the distance from the central source ( @xmath162 ) for each absorption component .",
    "we used the temperatures derived from the models , average recombination times for the dominant oxygen and silicon ions , and assuming there is no response to continuum variations on a time scale of 10 days .",
    "we find @xmath163 @xmath57 and @xmath164 pc for the log@xmath148 component , @xmath165 @xmath57 and @xmath166 pc for the log@xmath167 component , and @xmath168 @xmath57 and @xmath169 pc for the log@xmath146 component .",
    "the corresponding masses are @xmath170 , 390@xmath171 and 64@xmath171 solar masses , respectively , where @xmath171 is the absorption ( @xmath172 ) covering factor .",
    "the mass outflow rate is dominated by the lowest ionization component and is approximately @xmath173 solar masses per year , where @xmath174 is the radial filling factor of the flow .",
    "the very large number suggests a short duration outburst rather than continuous ejection .",
    "we also note that the covering factor can be small , of order 0.1 .",
    "the above distances are in agreement with the findings of behar et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , who have suggested the outflow is located at a distance of a few pc and is extended beyond 10  pc based on a comparison between the soft x - ray emission and absorption characteristics of the  data .",
    "a significant new aspect of our model is that the product @xmath175 is similar ( within a factor @xmath162 ) for all three absorption components .",
    "this raises the interesting possibility that all the components are in pressure equilibrium ( assuming gas pressure dominates the total pressure , i.e. radiation pressure and turbulent pressure are not important ) , and they all occupy the same volume of space . to test this idea ,",
    "we have calculated thermal stability curves ( log@xmath176 vs. log@xmath177 ) for the low - state continuum and our assumed composition ( table 2 ) under various assumptions .",
    "we have kept the uv sed unchanged and varied @xmath135(0.150 kev ) over a wide range .",
    "we have also investigated the possibility of a line - of - sight attenuation by the absorbing gas .",
    "this can be relevant for the situation under study since , even in the simplest geometry , two of the absorbers do not have a clear view of the central radiation source .",
    "screening by the lowest - ionization component ( log@xmath178 is the most important since this gas modifies the transmitted spectrum much more than the other components ( see fig .",
    "three such stability curves are shown in fig .",
    "12 , along with the location of the three ionization components .",
    "the exact location depends on the details of the assumed sed , the gas metallicity and opacity .",
    "the interesting feature of the stability diagram is that all radiation fields considered here result in extended , almost vertical parts between @xmath179k and @xmath180k .",
    "the curve for @xmath140 has a more extended vertical part since the higher mean energy of the radiation field results in a compton temperature .",
    "screening by the lowest - ionization component in ngc3783 is indeed important , but does not change the main result that , given the uncertainties on the sed and composition , all three ionization components lie on the stable part of the curve .",
    "we also note that , while here we only considered gas with a single composition , the details of the stability curve are abundance dependent .",
    "needless to say , very different curves will be obtained for significantly different seds .",
    "we note that k03 reach similar conclusions regarding the pressure equilibrium of their two ionization components .",
    "however , in our model all components are situated on stable branches of the thermal stability curve ( fig .",
    "12 ) while according to k03 , their high - ionization component is situated on the unstable branch ( their fig .",
    "we suspect that the difference is in part due to the different sed and metalicity assumed by k03 , and in part due to the method they used to calculate the curve .",
    "the existence of an additional stable - region along the curve of thermal - equilibrium ( intermediate between the cold and the hot branches ) where `` warm '' ( @xmath181k ) can survive is not a new idea .",
    "it has been discussed by marshall et al .",
    "( 1993 ) in their study of the multi - phase medium in ngc1068 , and later by many others .",
    "reynolds & fabian ( 1995 ) discussed the stability criteria and noted the narrow range of ionization parameter allowed for warm absorbers .",
    "hess et al ( 1997 ) discussed the various parameters governing the stability curve ( metallicity and more ) .",
    "komossa and collaborators ( e.g. komossa & fink , 1997 ; komossa & meerschweichen 2001 ) calculated many such curves , for different seds and metallicities , and discussed the location of warm absorbers as well as the possible link between the nlr and the x - ray gas .",
    "krolik & kriss ( 2001 ) considered multi - phase , warm - absorber winds and noted the various locations of stable , over - heated and over - cooled gas .",
    "kinkhabwala et al .",
    "( 2002 ) re - visited the thermal stability issue in ngc1068 and showed that a wide range of @xmath59 is needed to account for the observed x - ray emission lines .",
    "chelouche & netzer ( 2003 ) investigated the changes in the stability criteria for clouds with large internal line radiation pressure .",
    "most of these earlier works focused either on the allowed parts of the curve from general stability conditions , or on the location of a certain absorber observed in a certain source .",
    "our work shows that three very different aborbers in a source can all occupy extended , stable parts of the curve where the gas pressure is roughly the same .",
    "this means there may well be more than three absorbers spread over the vertical branch of the curves in fig .",
    "the three ionization parameters considered here may therefore represent some volume - averaged properties of the entire cloud ensemble .",
    "the column densities are therefore the total column densities of a large number of such clouds .",
    "moreover , the most - ionized component may provide the confining medium for the two other ionization components .",
    "needless to say , real confined outflowing clouds are characterised by a more complicated density and pressure structure than with the simplified , constant density clouds considered here ( e.g. see chelouche & netzer 2001 ) .    the pressure equilibrium between all three absorbers in ngc3783 suggest they occupy the same general location .",
    "this allows additional constraints to be placed on their density and location .",
    "specifically , we require that the distance of this region is at least 3.2 pc ( the minimum distance of the lowest ionization component ) . however , this zone can not be much further away because of total size and volume considerations . under the assumed conditions , the highest - ionization parameter component has the lowest density , and hence the largest dimension",
    ". however , its radial extent can not exceed about 500 pc ( the approximate radius of the narrow - line region ) , and thus its mean density can not fall below about 10 @xmath57 .",
    "pressure equilibrium then dictates the density of the lowest - ionization component , and a maximum distance of about 25 pc .",
    "this limitation is only imposed on discrete clouds  i.e. on the mean properties of the gas .",
    "real absorbers may not be `` clouds '' , they can cover a large range of distances , and can have properties which depend on location .",
    "the detailed investigation of such models is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "there is no indication for flux variation in any of the observed emission lines .",
    "however the measurement uncertainty on these line is rather large since the strongest lines are observed at the long wavelengths where the s / n is poor .",
    "we obtain satisfactory fits for most lines by assuming that the emission  line gas has the same column density and ionization parameter as the absorbing gas .",
    "the covering factors required for the emitting gas are 0.20.3 for the log@xmath148 component , 0.10.2 for the log@xmath167 component , and @xmath134 for the log@xmath146 component .",
    "the large range is due to the uncertainties in the continuum placement and in estimating the fraction of the and emission lines that are being absorbed by the line - of - sight gas ( the model shown in figs .",
    "7 and 8 assumes that _ all _ the emitted photons are seen through the absorbers ) .",
    "a clear shortcoming of the model is the fitting of the intercombination line .",
    "the intensity predicted for this line is too small by a large factor ( 2 - 4 ) .",
    "a large part of the discrepancy is due to the  @xmath182    absorption line situated close to this emission ( fig .",
    "this may be related to the problem discussed earlier .",
    "alternatively it may be a consequence of our assumption that all emission - line photons are seen through the absorbers .",
    "indeed , a model that assumes no absorption of the emitted photons by the line - of - sight gas ( not shown here ) would give a much better agreement to the absorption complex .",
    "this would also required a smaller emission covering factor .",
    "obviously we can not determine the exact geometry using current observations , and the real case may well be intermediate between those two extremes .",
    "we also note on the difference between the absorption covering factor ( 0.81.0 ) and the emission covering factor ( 0.10.3 ) . given the uncertain geometry and the fact that the first is a line - of - sight covering factor and the secong a globel ( @xmath172 ) property , the two are perhaps consistent with each other .",
    "we did not investigate all possibilities and can not comment in detail on special cases like biconical flows or a torus geometry ( e.g. krolik & kriss 2001 ) .    finally , comparing our method with that of k03",
    "we note that those authors do not calculate the emission line flux and profile in a self - consistent way .",
    "instaed , they add gaussian shaped emission profiles to their calculated absorption profiles ( e.g. their fig .",
    "this can result in significant differences regarding the line flux and ew .",
    "for example , our default approach assumes that all emission lines are seen through the absorber .",
    "in such a case , the entire `` blue '' wing of many emission lines is absorbed .",
    "clearly this affects the ew of the emission lines , but has almost no effect on the ew of the absorption features .",
    "in contrast , the approach adopted in k03 always results in a decrease of the ew of the absorption lines .",
    "ngc3783 contains time - variable absorbers in the uv that have been described in various earlier publications ( gabel et al .",
    "2003a and references therein ) .",
    "our analysis clearly indicates that at least one x - ray component contains gas which is of sufficiently low ionization so as to produce strong absorption lines of , and in the uv .",
    "the predicted ews of these uv lines depend on two factors that have been given little attention in this work : the exact shape of the uv continuum , and covering factor appropriate for the uv absorbers .",
    "a uv continuum which is softer than that assumed here can result in higher levels of ionization for carbon , nitrogen and oxygen , with little effect on most x - ray lines .",
    "this is very important for the @xmath183  and @xmath184    lines , but less so for the uv lines of that are directly linked to the column density discussed here .    as for the covering factors ,",
    "the size of the uv continuum source is likely to be much larger than the size of the central x - ray source .",
    "thus the covering factor appropriate in the uv can be different to that appropriate in the x - ray .",
    "this will result in saturated uv absorption lines whose ews are smaller than the ones indicated by the column densities derived here .",
    "however , our upper limit on the density of the low - ionization component , combined with its column density , suggest a very large line - of - sight dimension ( @xmath185 cm ) . assuming lateral dimension of the same size or large , we conclude that the physical dimension of this component is much larger than the expected dimension of any likely uv source ( e.g. the surface of a thin accretion disk ) .",
    "a combined analysis of the uv and x - ray results , taking these such points into consideration , is in progress    uv absorbers are also uv emitters , and the low - ionization component can also contribute to the observed uv emission lines .",
    "our photoionization calculations show that this contribution is very small .",
    "for example , an emission covering factor of 0.1 , similar to the one deduced from the x - ray emission lines , will produce @xmath186 line with emission ew of about 1 .",
    "perhaps the most interesting result of this study is the appearance and disappearance of the soft excess component .",
    "this broad - band continuum source was seen in two of the six observations . on average , these are the two observations with the highest luminosity . an increase in softness ratio with increasing source luminosity is well known and well documented in a number of agn ( e.g. magdziarz et al . , 1998 ; chiang et al . , 2000 ; markowitz & edelson 2001 ) .",
    "however we are not aware of a softness ratio increase that is _ not correlated _ with a short wavelength flux increase .",
    "ngc3783 seems to be the first agn to show this phenomenon , but we suspect that careful spectroscopic monitoring will reveal the same or a similar behavior in other sources .",
    "this has important consequences to the continuum production mechanism , as well as for the modeling of the warm x - ray gas around the center .",
    "we do not know the origin of the soft continuum source .",
    "in particular , we do not have information on its flux at wavelengths @xmath187   ( the source was not in a high - state in any of the published  observations ) .",
    "it may be related to a broad - band phenomenon ( e.g. due a flaring accretion disk ) , or a component covering a narrower band ( e.g. a single temperature black body ) .",
    "simple global energy consideration show that this phenomenon is unrelated to the appearance of broad emission features like those claimed to be seen in at least two sources and interpreted as due to relativistic disk lines ( branduardi et al 2001 ; mason et al .",
    "2002 ; but see also lee et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "finally , we must comment on the possibility of a more complex behavior . our analysis",
    "is based on the fitting of a single powerlaw continuum at low - state and the addition of a soft x - ray component during the high - state .",
    "however , an equivalent analysis could be carried out in the reverse order  i.e. starting from a pure powerlaw for the high - state and _ subtracting _ a continuum component to explain the low - state spectrum . however , as argued earlier , the observed spectral changes at long wavelengths are too large to be explained by pure opacity variations and it is not at all clear what other mechanism could explain an agn continuum with flux deficit at long wavelengths .",
    "our detailed measurements and analysis of the 900 ks data set of ngc3783 lead to the following results :    1 .",
    "the source fluctuates in luminosity , by a factor @xmath0 , during individual 170 ks observations .",
    "the fluctuations are not associated with significant spectral variations .",
    "2 .   on time scales of 20120 days",
    ", the source exhibits two very different spectral shapes denoted here as the high- and low - states .",
    "the two are associated with different softness ratios that seem unrelated to the total x - ray luminosity .",
    "the observed changes in the underlying continuum can be described as due to the appearance ( in the high - state ) and disappearance ( in the low - state ) of a soft excess component .",
    "the origin of this continuum component is not clear . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", ngc3783 is the first agn to show such a behavior .",
    "the appearance of the soft continuum component can explain all spectral variations observed within the measurement uncertainties . there is no need to invoke opacity changes between the high- and low - states .",
    "this conclusion depends mostly on the s / n in the high state spectrum .",
    "4 .   a combination of three ionization components , each split into two kinematic components , provides a good description of the intensity of almost all the absorption lines and bound - free edges observed .",
    "the components span a large range of ionization , and have a total column of about 4@xmath1 @xmath2 .",
    "the only real discrepancy between the observed and theoretical spectra are for the iron m - shell uta feature at 1616.5 .",
    "this is most likely due to inadequate dielectronic recombination rates currently available to use in our calculations .",
    "the largest other uncertainty is in the column density of .",
    "the three generic absorbers discussed in this work have very similar values of @xmath175 .",
    "we speculate that the absorbers may be in pressure equilibrium with each other , occupying the same volume in the nucleus .",
    "this is the first confirmation of the location of several x - ray absorbers on the vertical part of the log@xmath176 vs. log@xmath177 ) stability curve of agn .",
    "we have obtained thee lower limits on the gas distance from the center , corresponding to our three generic absorbers .",
    "the limits are 3.2 pc , 0.6 pc and about 0.2 for the low ionization , intermediate ionization and high ionization absorbers , respectively .",
    "the pressure equilibrium assumption implies distances in the range 325  pc .",
