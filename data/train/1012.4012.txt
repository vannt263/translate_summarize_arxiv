    "luminous ir galaxies ( lirgs : i.e. , @xmath3 ) were discovered in the 1980s with the infra red astronomical satellite ( iras ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , due to their strong emission at 12 - 100@xmath4 m , and today are an important class of objects for understanding massive galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "follow - up observations with iso and spitzer have shown that lirgs comprise a significant fraction ( 50 - 70% ) of the cosmic infrared background and dominate the star - formation activity at @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "ultra luminous ir galaxies ( ulirgs : i.e. , @xmath6 ) are typically a mixture of disk galaxy pairs , interactions , or mergers @xcite .",
    "( u)lirgs are also observed to be rich in molecular gas and dust @xcite ; interaction drives the gas inward , resulting in enhanced star formation rates . in the local universe , ulirgs are relatively rare , but are about a thousand times more frequent at @xmath7 as shown by observations of the population of sub - mm galaxies @xcite .",
    "recent discoveries have revealed that the central black hole mass is constrained by and closely related to properties of the host galaxy s bulge ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which suggests a co - evolution of the central black hole and the galaxy itself .",
    "given both the evidence that merging lirgs likely evolve into massive elliptical and s0 galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and that lirgs are stellar nurseries ( see e.g. * ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the study of nuclear regions of a complete sample of lirgs spanning all merger and interaction stages allows us to investigate the coeval nature of both processes .    the picture that mergers",
    "transform disc galaxies into elliptical galaxies is supported by numerical simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , potentially linking lirg activity to a key step in the formation of the galaxy morphologies seen locally .",
    "other recent simulations have shown evidence that this may be more complicated ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting the importance of different merger - mass ratios , gas - fraction and feedback processes due to supernovae or agn activity .",
    "moreover , the exact number of merger progenitors is controversial ; while the vast majority of interacting ( u)lirgs are likely two galaxy systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , there may be also a small fraction of lirgs that involve three galaxies and substantial star - formation between the merging nuclei @xcite .",
    "while previous ground - based observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have revealed that a significant fraction of merger remnants seems to exhibit radial profiles similar to elliptical galaxies based on their large - scale appearance ( at radii of several kpc ) , we are able to probe the first time the stellar light distribution in the central kpc for a large sample of nearby mergers .",
    "merger models that incorporate hydrodynamics and star formation suggest that dissipation in mergers produces central starbursts which lead to a steepening of the central profile well above the extrapolation of a @xcite profile fit to the main body of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "indeed , recent observations have revealed such central `` extra light '' or `` cuspiness '' components for some elliptical galaxies @xcite . in particular , @xcite have shown that the observed extra light can be identified with the central density excess produced in simulations of gas - rich mergers and that such components are ubiquitous in the local cusp elliptical population @xcite , based on samples from @xcite and @xcite . however , although the idea that almost all the gas falls to the center to fuel a central starburst or agn might be true for ulirgs , this process may be less prevalent in lirgs . in principle",
    ", a lirg sample spanning all merger stages can be used to test the model of merger - induced cusp - building along the merger stage sequence .",
    "the great observatories all - sky lirg survey ( goals , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) provides an excellent sample to compare to these models and observations .    to reveal the detailed structure of the nuclear regions , where dust obscuration may mask star clusters , agn and additional nuclei from optical view , we study 73 of most luminous ( u)lirgs in the goals sample using the hubble space telescope ( hst ) near infrared camera and multi - object spectrometer ( nicmos ) . this high - resolution near",
    "infra - red ( nir ) imaging sample is unique not only in its completeness and sample size , but also in the proximity and brightness of the galaxies .",
    "moreover , a wealth of additional information about the properties of these galaxies ( e.g. mid - ir distribution , mid - ir line diagnostics , merger stage ) is available , since the goals project combines multi - wavelength imaging and spectroscopic data from space ( spitzer , hst , galex , and chandra ) and ground - based telescopes . in particular , a detailed multi - wavelength study of the lirg markarian 266 @xcite reveals nuclear and galactic - scale outflows , shock - heated gas and the presence of a dual agn .",
    "@xcite found that at least half of the mir emission is extended for more than 30% of local lirgs , as well as an increasing compactness towards the final stage of major merger interaction .",
    "furthermore , the relationship between the ir and uv properties ( e.g. the irx-@xmath8 relation as a function of lirg properties * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has been investigated .",
    "the optical goals hst images ( acs / wfc f435w and f814w filters ) have clearly shown the inner spiral structure , dust lanes , extended filamentary emission , and star clusters in the nuclear regions and tidal tails of lirgs @xcite .    to understand the manner in which clusters , agn , and nuclei evolve as a function of luminosity and merger stage , it is essential to first unveil the hidden nuclei and to model the nuclear structure .",
    "this requires both high spatial resolution ( @xmath1100  pc ) and the ability to penetrate the dust .",
    "unfortunately , it is almost impossible to reveal the circumnuclear regions and to identify the nuclei in lirgs with observations at optical wavelengths , simply because they are extremely dusty . on the other hand ,",
    "nir imaging is 1 ) less affected by dust extinction and hence provides an almost unobscured view on the nuclear region of galaxies , and 2 ) best suited to trace the old stellar population since nir light is less biased by young blue stars that can dominate the optical light but contribute only a minor fraction by mass to the total stellar population . in particular , detailed information about the nuclear structure is crucial to reveal double or multiple nuclei to estimate merging time scales which can provide important constraints for the lifetime of the ir luminous phase and associated galaxy evolution scenarios .",
    "therefore , hst nicmos images are perfectly suited to observe more directly the true nuclear morphologies by combining the high resolution of the hst ( @xmath9 fwhm ) which corresponds to 30 - 300  pc over the distance range 40 - 400  mpc ( with a median resolution of 106  pc at a median distance of 142  mpc ) at wavelengths where dust extinction is reduced by an order of magnitude compared to visual wavelengths .    our nicmos imaging has revealed the presence of double and triple nuclei lirg systems .",

    "new hst images with nicmos / nic2 have been obtained using the f160w filter for 44 lirgs within a total time of 59 orbits ( program 11235 , surace p.i . ) .",

    "fifteen of the galaxies in our sample have two apparent optical nuclei separated by 15@xmath1640@xmath16 , or inclined disks with extensions greater than 20@xmath16 , and thus required two pointings per orbit .",

    "additional corrections were made to the individual frames to correct for bias offsets and we recombined the images using the stis software .",
    "a world coordinate system ( wcs ) correction could not be performed directly using cataloged star coordinates given the limited field of view ( fov ) of the nicmos camera nic2 ( @xmath18 ) . instead",
    "the hst acs images , which have a far larger fov ( @xmath19 ) , have been calibrated with star position references ( 2mass ) in a first step and we subsequently carefully applied a wcs transformation of our nicmos images given the corrected hst acs images using corresponding reference points in both images ( such as stars not cataloged , bright star cluster knots , or similar features ) .",
    "furthermore , galfit @xcite is used to fit the f160w light from the underlying old stellar population and the agn ( see  .",
    "[ sec : galfit ] for details ) .",
    "here we present results of the nuclear stellar properties of 73 lirg systems .",
    "most of these systems are major merger , however , some lirgs in our sample are isolated undisturbed galaxies , suggesting that other mechanisms rather than merger interaction may trigger the ir luminosity in those isolated undisturbed lirgs ( e.g. high gas fraction and stellar mass , cold gas accretion , or other internal dynamical processes ) .",
    "therefore , these two sub - classes of lirgs , interacting and isolated galaxies , are treated separately in our studies .",
    "furthermore , to study the stellar nuclear properties as a function of merger stage ( see   [ subsec : res - galfit ] ) , we have applied a classification into different merger stages of our interacting lirgs as described in the following .",
    "the non - merger / merger separation as well as the merger classification scheme is based on the wide - field i- and b - band images .",
    "while the hst nicmos h - band images reveal the unobscured nuclei and stellar components , the hst acs i- and b - band images provide a larger fov for the detection of companion galaxies and are very sensitive for tracing tidal tails and other interaction features which are essential to identify the merger stage .",
    "this provides a distinct advantage over using a simple projected nuclear separation to infer the merger stage , which suffers from degeneracies when exploring a large range in stages . to establish a merger classification we carefully separated at first our sample into galaxies that exhibit interaction features ( e.g. tidal tails , bridges ) or have nearby companions , and those without any interaction features or nearby companions ( undisturbed single galaxies ) , excluding the latter from our merger sequence analysis .",
    "the mergers are classified into six different stages ( based on the scheme first proposed by * ? ? ?",

    "* ) ; an example for each merger stage based on the i - band images is shown in fig .",

    "as most of the galaxies in our sample are mergers , and hence exhibit disturbed outer disks , we have not attempted to obtain a precise model for the entire merger system as arbitrary fitting of the high spatial frequency components does not add to a parametric model of the systems .",
    "instead , we focused on an accurate measurement of the bulge luminosity and central concentration indices , as these parameters provide important information about the build - up of stellar mass in the center of galaxies during the merger process .",
    "we performed a careful analysis of each galaxy , also identifying cases where a global bulge - disk decomposition would not work .",
    "running galfit on an image requires initial preparation .",
    "the desired fitting region and sky background must be provided , and the psf image , bad pixel mask ( if needed ) , and pixel noise map must be generated .",

    "( 2 ) the fitting region must be large enough to include the outer galaxy disk or entire merger system , as well as some sky region .",
    "( 3 ) sky backgrounds were measured separately using a region where no emission is present and designated as fixed parameters for all galfit procedures . in general a fitting of the sky background is not recommended as the wings of the bulge srsic profile @xcite can become inappropriately extended , resulting in a srsic index that is too high .",
    "( 4 ) we simulated the required psf image with the tinytim code @xcite using a pixel scale identical to that of the observations .",
    "( 5 ) the uncertainty images are generated by the hst reduction pipeline and used as weighting images required for galfit to perform the @xmath32 minimization .",
    "after these preparation steps we carried out an iterative process to perform a 1 - 3 component decomposition of the nicmos images described in the following : galfit requires initial guesses for each component it fits and uses a levenberg - marquardt downhillgradient algorithm to determine the minimum @xmath32 based on the input guesses . at first we fitted single srsic profiles that are centered on the galaxies nuclei ( typically 1 - 2 nuclei per image ) . for merger systems that consists of two or more galaxies , we take advantage of galfits ability to fit simultaneously multiple components at different spatial regions .",
    "the srsic profile has the following form : @xmath33 } \\label{eq : sersic}\\ ] ] with the effective radius @xmath34 , the surface brightness @xmath35 at @xmath34 , the power law index @xmath36 , and @xmath37 coupled to @xmath36 such that half of the total flux is always within @xmath34 .",
    "the advantage of the srsic profile is that it is very useful for modeling different components of a galaxy such as bulges , flat disks , and bars , simply by varying the exponent .",
    "as the index @xmath36 becomes smaller , the the core flattens faster for @xmath38 , and the intensity drops more steeply for @xmath39 .",
    "classical bulges typically have a srsic index of @xmath40 ( in general known as de vaucouleurs profile ) , but can vary between @xmath41 , while the outer disk follows an exponential profile ( @xmath42 ) .",

    "the center coordinates have been fixed for the subsequent fitting steps .",
    "a multi component fit is performed on each individual galaxy . in general",
    "a double srsic component is used , while possible additional galaxies are subtracted using their single srsic parameters from step 1 . in cases where the galaxy shows no significant disturbances we fitted the sum of an exponential and srsic component with fixed position angle .",
    "an additional srsic component has been fitted when a bar was present .",
    "as suggested by @xcite , the bar can be well described by an elongated , low index srsic ( n @xmath13 1 ) profile .",
    "for each galaxy a variety of different multi - component fits are performed ( typically 4 - 7 different fit setups per galaxy ) and compared afterwards .",
    "fitted models were selected only as long as the model parameters were all well behaved , i.e. requiring that all parameters such as bulge radius and srsic index converged within the range of reasonable values ( e.g. @xmath43 ) .",
    "the best fit was chosen based on several criteria : first , galfit calculates the @xmath44 for each model which generally declines as more free parameters or srsic components are given .",
    "however , a small @xmath44 does not necessarily mean that the solution with an extra bar component is more correct physically .",
    "thus , an increasing @xmath44 for a model with an extra bar component was interpreted that the fit should not be adopted , but a decreasing @xmath44 was not considered as a sufficient condition to adopt an extra bar component . in cases with prominent bars , a symmetric light distribution due to unsubtracted bar light",
    "was often found in the bulge - disk residuals .",
    "for these cases we added an extra bar component since it would otherwise lead to an extended bulge .    for objects with central point sources such as an agn",
    ", the bulge srsic index can be overestimated unless an extra nuclear component ( psf component ) is added to the model . on the other hand , nuclear stellar cusps can mimic a central point source and adding a nuclear psf would lead to an underestimation of otherwise a steeper srsic index .",
    "therefore , we used galfit in a first attempt without a central psf component and calculated the central residual excess light from the residual image of the final fit . in cases where a central residual was present ( for @xmath110% of the sample ) we reran galfit with an additional psf component to take into account the extra central light originating from a central point source .",
    "we also checked all lirgs that show signs for agn activity ( based on 6.2  @xmath4 m pah equivalent width , see ",
    "[ subsec : dis - agn ] ) whether a psf component is present or not . for those cases where the model successfully converged with the extra component ,",
    "the images were visually inspected to verify the presence of a central bright source . where new model parameters were not unreasonable and not identical to the case without the point source , the new model was adopted .",

    "agn activity might also effect the observed nir luminosity and hence one would expect a possible contribution to the measured bulge luminosity .",
    "this could subsequently explain the increase of the bh mass ( bulge luminosity ) with larger ir luminosity ( see fig .",
    "[ bulge_irlum ] and eq .",
    "[ eq : ir_bulge ] ) .",
    "however , a possible contribution of agn activity to the bulge luminosity is not very likely since most of our bulges are resolved and have typical ranges of 0.5 - 2  kpc while the main dust heating by agn ( 500 - 2000k ) is generated on scales of ( 10 - 100 )  pc @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the central light excess expected from an agn contributes on average less than 5% to the total bulge luminosity for our sample ( see fig .  [ eqw_res ] ) .",
    "we have studied the nuclear stellar properties of 73 lirg systems ( log[l@xmath23/l@xmath24@xmath99 ) using high - resolution h - band images obtained with hst nicmos revealing a large variety of double and triple nuclei merger systems . to investigate the effect of the merging process on the evolution of galaxies , such as the growth of the central bh or stellar concentration",
    ", we studied several morphological parameters as a function of merger stage using galfit .",
    "the main results are summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "the fraction of lirg systems with at least two interacting nuclei is 63% .",
    "triple nuclei systems are found for at least 3 ( possibly 5 ) lirg systems .",
    "the comparison of our nicmos images with comparable resolution hst b - band images revealed that roughly 50% of the double nuclei are obscured by dust , with 10 of the obscured nuclei responsible for the primary mid - ir emission ( mips 24@xmath4 m ) .",
    "this implies strong limitations on the ability to detect the true nuclear structures of luminous infrared galaxies at high - redshift and may explain some of the apparent discrepancy between the lirg population at local and high - redshift ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "2 .   ulirgs ( log[l@xmath23/l@xmath24 @xmath21 12.0 ) have significantly smaller nuclear separations than lirgs ( log[l@xmath23/l@xmath24@xmath100 11.4  12.0 ) with a median value of 1.2  kpc and 6.7  kpc , respectively . in our sample , merger ( regardless of whether lirg or ulirg ) seem to be prevalent at two time scales ( based on the projected nuclear separation and mass ratio of the nuclei ) : first , at a remaining merger time scale of @xmath101<1.3 $ ]  gyr ( 53% of mergers in our sample ) , and second , at @xmath102\\sim 0 $ ] ( 26% ) , likely representing the first passage of interacting galaxies and the final nuclear coalescence , respectively .",
    "an average post - merger time ( lirg phase after the nuclei merged ) of 0.3  gyr is estimated .",
    "the bulge luminosity shows , on average , a small increase ( about a factor of 1.8 ) towards late merger stages .",
    "interestingly , the lirgs in our sample that show no interaction features have on average a significantly larger bulge luminosity ( a factor of two ) than interacting lirgs . this is likely to be a selection effect for more intrinsically luminous non - merging galaxies among the lirg sample .",
    "the bulge luminosity surface density @xmath59 increases significantly along the merger sequence which is primarily due to a decrease of the bulge radius towards late merger stages .",
    "these findings are in agreement with models that include gas inflow which can dramatically affect the measured bulge properties during the merging process .",
    "no significant dependence of the bulge srsic index is found as a function of merger stage .",
    "although no significant correlation between the 6.2@xmath4 m pah eqw and the core excess light in the h band is found , lirgs with the largest core excess exhibit slightly smaller pah eqws , suggesting more hot dust emission and hence agn activity .",
    "at least seven lirgs in our sample exhibit warm dust emission ( @xmath103% of its total infrared luminosity ) that is clearly offset form the nucleus . instead",
    ", their emission regions seem to be associated with spiral arms , a possible secondary nucleus , or the region between the merging nuclei .",

    "<S> we present results of hubble space telescope nicmos h - band imaging of 73 of most luminous ( i.e. , log[@xmath0>11.4 $ ] ) infrared galaxies ( lirgs ) in the great observatories all - sky lirg survey ( goals ) . </S>",
    "<S> this dataset combines multi - wavelength imaging and spectroscopic data from space ( spitzer , hst , galex , and chandra ) and ground - based telescopes . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we use the high - resolution near - infrared data to recover nuclear structure that is obscured by dust at optical wavelengths and measure the evolution in this structure along the merger sequence . </S>",
    "<S> a large fraction of all galaxies in our sample possess double nuclei ( @xmath163% ) or show evidence for triple nuclei ( @xmath16% ) . </S>",
    "<S> half of these double nuclei are not visible in the hst b - band images due to dust obscuration . </S>",
    "<S> the majority of interacting lirgs have remaining merger timescales of 0.3 to 1.3 gyrs , based on the projected nuclear separations and the mass ratio of nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the bulge luminosity surface density @xmath2 increases significantly along the merger sequence ( primarily due to a decrease of the bulge radius ) , while the bulge luminosity shows a small increase towards late merger stages . </S>",
    "<S> no significant increase of the bulge srsic index is found . </S>",
    "<S> lirgs that show no interaction features have on average a significantly larger bulge luminosity , suggesting that non merging lirgs have larger bulge masses than merging lirgs . </S>",
    "<S> this may be related to the flux limited nature of the sample and the fact that mergers can significantly boost the ir luminosity of otherwise low luminosity galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the projected nuclear separation is significantly smaller for ulirgs ( median value of 1.2  kpc ) than for lirgs ( mean value of 6.7  kpc ) , suggesting that the lirg phase appears earlier in mergers than the ulirg phase . </S>"
