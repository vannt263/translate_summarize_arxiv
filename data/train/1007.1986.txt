    "while feedback can not increase the capacity of a point - to - point memoryless channel , it can decrease the probability of error as well as the complexity of the encoder and decoder . for an awgn channel without feedback , it is known @xcite that the decay in the probability of error as a function of the blocklength @xmath3 is at most exponential in the absence of feedback ( i.e. the lowest achievable probability of error has the general form @xmath7 ) . , @xmath8 is equivalent to @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is equivalent to @xmath11 .",
    "] however , when a noiseless delay - less infinite capacity feedback link is available , a simple sequential linear scheme ( the schalkwijk - kailath scheme @xcite ) can achieve the capacity of this channel with a doubly exponential decay in the probability of error as a function of the blocklength ( i.e. it has the general form @xmath12 ) . this shows the significant role of feedback in reducing the probability of error .",
    "the schalkwijk - kailath scheme requires a noiseless feedback link with infinite capacity .",
    "in fact , the schalkwijk - kailath scheme does not provide the best possible error decay rate given such an ideal feedback link .",
    "in particular , it is shown in @xcite that in the presence of an ideal noise - free delay - less feedback link , the capacity of the awgn channel can be achieved with a probability of error that decreases with an exponential order which is linearly increasing with blocklength ( i.e. it has the general form @xmath13 ) . is used to denote function composition . ] however , once the feedback channel is corrupted with some noise , the benefits of feedback in terms of the error probability decay rate can drop .",
    "in fact , when this corruption corresponds to an additive white gaussian noise on the feedback channel , the schalkwijk - kailath communication scheme ( or any other linear scheme ) fails to achieve any nonzero rate with vanishing error probability @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in this case , the achievable error decay for any coding scheme can be no better than exponential in blocklength @xcite , similar to the case without feedback @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we consider a case where the feedback link is noiseless and delay - less but rate - limited .",
    "the advantages of rate - limited feedback in reducing the coding complexity are investigated in @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we study the benefits of rate limited feedback in terms of decreasing the error probability . assuming a positive and feasible ( below capacity ) rate @xmath1 is to be transmitted on the forward channel , we characterize the achievable error decay rates in two cases : the case where the feedback rate , @xmath0 , is lower than @xmath1 , and the case where @xmath2 . for the first scenario , we show that the best achievable error probability decreases exponentially in the code blocklength @xmath3 ( i.e. @xmath7 ) and provide an upper bound for the error exponent . for the second scenario , we propose an iterative coding scheme which achieves a doubly exponential error decay ( i.e. @xmath12 ) .",
    "since a feedback rate equal to the data rate is sufficient for achieving a doubly exponential error decay , one might suspect that further increasing the feedback rate may not lead to a significant gain .",
    "we dispel this suspicion by generalizing our proposed iterative scheme to show that if @xmath6 , an @xmath5 order exponential decay is achievable .",
    "the latter result is consistent with @xcite , in which the achievable error probabilities are characterized in terms of the number of times the ( infinite capacity ) feedback link is used .",
    "interestingly , our results show that the error exponent as a function of the feedback rate has a strong discontinuity at the point @xmath14 ; it is finite for @xmath15 and infinite for @xmath2 ( due to the achievability of a doubly exponential error decay ) .",
    "although only @xmath2 can lead to a super - exponential error decay , even for smaller feedback rates , we expect to have a strictly higher error decay rate as compared to the case with no feedback .",
    "in particular we show that for @xmath16 , the error exponent is at least @xmath0 higher than the error exponent in the absence of feedback .",
    "the problem of communication over the awgn channel with limited feedback has been previously considered assuming different types of corruption on the feedback channel . in particular , the corruption on the feedback channel has been modeled as additive gaussian noise in @xcite and @xcite and as quantization noise in @xcite .",
    "another type of feedback corruption has been considered in @xcite where only a subsequence of the channel outputs can be sent back noiselessly to the transmitter .",
    "a fundamental distinction between our model and the ones considered above is that in our model the receiver has `` full control '' over what is transmitted and received on the feedback link .",
    "this is due to the fact that under the rate - limited feedback scenario , the feedback link is assumed to be both noiseless and active in the sense that at each time , the feedback message is allowed to be an encoded function of all the information available at the receiver at that time .",
    "communication with imperfect feedback has also been investigated in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for variable - length coding strategies .",
    "our model on the other hand captures a scenario where the blocklength and therefore the decoding delay is fixed .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in section ii we present the system model and the problem formulation . in section iii",
    "we consider the case where the feedback rate is higher than the forward rate .",
    "specifically , using a simple iterative coding scheme we show the achievability of an @xmath5 order exponential error decay when @xmath6 . in section",
    "iv we consider the case where @xmath17 and show that in this case the decay in probability of error is at most exponential ( finite first order error exponent ) . although a feedback rate less than @xmath1 can not provide super - exponential error decay , we will show in section v that it increases the error exponent by at least @xmath0 .",
    "section vi shows that the necessary and sufficient conditions for super - exponential error decay remain the same even if we express the feedback limitation as a constraint on the per channel use feedback rate instead of the average feedback rate .",

    "over all such communication schemes , we represent the one with minimum average probability of error with the tuple @xmath59 and denote the corresponding minimum error probability by @xmath60 . in the case where the feedback rate is zero ,",
    "we simply drop the feedback rate term and use @xmath61 and @xmath62 to represent the optimal non - feedback code and the corresponding error probability , respectively .",
    "the capacity of the awgn channel is denoted by @xmath63 , where    @xmath64    for the communication system described above , the first order error exponent or simply the error exponent is defined as    @xmath65    where a positive value of the error exponent implies that the error decay rate is at least exponential .",
    "we also define higher order error exponents .",
    "in particular , given @xmath66 , the @xmath5 order error exponent is defined as @xmath67 given the above definitions , a communication system with strictly positive @xmath5 order error exponent has an @xmath5 order exponential error decay ( i.e. @xmath68 ) .",
    "when the feedback rate is higher than the forward rate @xmath1 , we can achieve a super - exponential ( in blocklength ) error decay . this result is presented in the following theorem .",
    "[ thm : r_rfb_1 ] for any @xmath70 which satisfies @xmath71 and @xmath72 , a strictly positive second order error exponent is achievable :    @xmath73    see appendix",

    "we use a class of simple iterative coding schemes to prove the above achievability results .",
    "in particular , to achieve a doubly exponential error decay we propose a multi - phase coding scheme as follows : in the first phase , called the initial transmission , the message is sent using a non - feedback code that occupies a big portion of the transmission block ( @xmath76 out of @xmath3 ) . in the second phase , called the intermediate decoding / feedback phase , the receiver decodes the message based on the received signals and feeds back the decoded message to the transmitter , using @xmath77 nats of the available feedback . depending on the validity of the decoded message the transmitter decides to stay silent or perform boosted retransmission . in the case",
    "the message is decoded correctly , the transmitter stays silent during the rest of the transmission time .",
    "otherwise , it sends a sign of failure in the next ( @xmath78 ) transmission and uses the remaining portion of the transmission block ( @xmath79 ) to send the message with an exponentially ( in block length ) high power .",
    "while retransmission with such a large power guarantees a doubly exponential error decay , it does not violate the power constraint since the probability of incorrect decoding in the second phase is exponentially ( in block length ) low .    to guarantee an @xmath80fold exponential decay when",
    "the available feedback rate is @xmath81 , for some integer @xmath82 , the above scheme can be modified to include @xmath83 rounds of intermediate decoding / feedback and boosted retransmission , where retransmission at each round , if needed , is done with exponentially higher power than the previous retransmission .",
    "note that in comparison with the schalkwijk - kailath ( sk ) scheme presented in @xcite , the above iterative technique needs less feedback ( @xmath84 nats instead of the infinite rate required by the sk scheme ) and provides better error decay rate .",
    "in the previous section we have shown that by utilizing a feedback link with a rate higher than the forward rate , we can reduce the error probability significantly as compared to the case with no feedback .",
    "the high reliability of the iterative scheme presented in the last section is due to the fact that the initial decoding error at the receiver ( which is a rare event ) is perfectly detectable at the transmitter .",
    "therefore it can be corrected by retransmitting the message with high power without violating the average power constraint .",
    "the perfect error detection at the transmitter is obtained from the feedback of the initial decoded message at the receiver . however ,",
    "when the feedback rate is lower than the forward rate , the receiver has to use a source code to compress its decoded message before feeding it back .",
    "the transmitter must then reconstruct the uncompressed decoded message to detect any error .",
    "since this reconstruction involves some first order exponential ( in blocklength ) error decay ( corresponding to the source coding error exponent ) , the error detection is erroneous with the same decay rate .",
    "therefore , the mis - detection of the receiver error due to the compression on the feedback link dominates the error probability .    while the above intuitive explanation justifies the failure of the block retransmission schemes in achieving a super - exponential error decay , one might still hope that such a decay rate can be achieved using other schemes .",
    "for example one alternative is to look at the problem from a stochastic control point of view and use a rate - limited variant of the recursive feedback schemes presented in @xcite and @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we show that no matter what communication scheme is used , one can not achieve infinite first order error exponent .",
    "[ thm : r_fb_r ] given @xmath85 , the first order error exponent is upper bounded by    @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 is the solution to @xmath89    see appendix .",
    "the proof , which is rather lengthy , can be explained using the following observation .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that given a peak power constraint , the best achievable error decay is exponential .",
    "therefore , in order to achieve a super - exponential error decay , the transmitter should be able to boost the power under certain circumstances .",
    "however , given the expected power constraint , the power can be boosted only under rare occasions where the receiver would decode wrongly otherwise . therefore , there should be enough feedback bits to communicate the occurrence of those rare occasions to the sender .",
    "it turns out that this requirement is met only if the number of possible feedback messages ( @xmath90 ) is at least as large as the number of forward messages ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "note that the error exponent upper bound provided in the above theorem stays bounded as @xmath0 approaches @xmath1 from below . on the other hand , we showed in the previous section that for any feedback rate higher than @xmath1",
    ", the error exponent is infinite ( doubly exponential decay ) .",
    "these two facts lead to an interesting conclusion : the error exponent as a function of the feedback rate has a sharp discontinuity at the point @xmath14 .",
    "the above theorem provides an upper bound on the first order error exponent for feedback rates below @xmath1 .",
    "we conjecture that a similar result may be obtained on the boundedness of the @xmath5 order error exponent for feedback rates below @xmath84 .",
    "we have shown in the previous section that the probability of error when @xmath16 can not decay faster than exponential as a function of the blocklength @xmath3 .",
    "although the feedback in this case does not provide an infinite error exponent , we still expect that the error exponent should be improved in the presence of feedback as compared to the non - feedback scenario . in this section",
    "we will show that the error exponent with feedback is at least @xmath0 above the non - feedback error exponent .",
    "the main result of this section is the following theorem .",
    "[ thm : r_fb_r_lb ] for all rates @xmath72 , such that @xmath85 , the error exponent is lower bounded as follows @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the error exponent for the awgn channel in the absence of feedback .",
    "see appendix .",
    "the achievability scheme for the above result is constructed using the multi - phase scheme proposed in the proof of theorem [ thm : r_rfb_1 ] , in conjunction with a compression technique to reduce the rate of feedback in the intermediate decoding / feedback phase from @xmath1 to @xmath0 .",
    "using such a scheme , the error probability is dominated by the probability of error mis - detection .",
    "this error term is the product of the probability of error in the initial transmission phase ( @xmath94 ) and the probability ( @xmath95 ) that the compression loss hides this event from the transmitter .",
    "in the previous sections we focused on a scenario where the _ average _ rate over the whole transmission block was constrained to be lower than @xmath0 . under that constraint , the receiver can use the available feedback ( @xmath96 nats ) any time during the transmission . in particular , using the coding scheme proposed in section iii , the receiver collects all the feedback bits and uses them in one feedback transmission at the end of the first phase . in this section we consider a _ per channel use _ feedback rate constraint . under this constraint",
    ", the receiver can not feed back more than @xmath0 nats after each channel use .",
    "this translates to the following constraint on the size of the feedback signal alphabet at each time @xmath97 :    @xmath98 given the per channel use feedback constraint , if @xmath6 and @xmath72 , a strictly positive @xmath5 order error exponent is achievable : @xmath75    see appendix .",
    "the above result is proved using a combination of the scheme presented in section iii and a block markov coding scheme which is described in the appendix .",
    "figure [ fig : blockmarkov ] illustrates an example of this iterative coding scheme for the case where @xmath99 .",
    "we considered the impact of rate - limited noiseless feedback on the error probability in awgn channels .",
    "we first showed that if the feedback rate @xmath0 that exceeds the rate @xmath1 of the data transmitted on the forward channel , one can achieve a super - exponential decay in probability of error as a function of the code blocklength .",
    "our achievability result is based on a multi - phase scheme in which an initial transmission of the message , if decoded incorrectly , is followed by the retransmission of the message with boosted power .",
    "a key requirement in this scheme is for the transmitter to perfectly detect the error in the initial transmission every time it happens . the minimum feedback rate required to perfectly communicate the initial decoded message is @xmath1 and therefore our scheme fails to achieve a super - exponential error decay for @xmath15 .",
    "we showed that this is true for any scheme .",
    "that is , @xmath2 is also a necessary condition for achieving a super - exponential error decay . while we provided an upper bound for the error exponent when @xmath15 , we also showed that even in this case , the use of feedback increases the error exponent by at least @xmath0 . for the case",
    "in which @xmath6 , for some positive integer @xmath4 , we generalized our multi - phase iterative scheme to prove the achievability of an @xmath80 fold exponential ( in blocklength ) error decay .",
    "the above results are illustrated in figure [ fig : cartoon ] .",
