    "both the experimental and theoretical investigations of exotic hadronic states , i.e. particles that are beyond the schemes of traditional hadron spectroscopy , seem already formed as one of the interesting and rising branches of the high energy physics . since the pioneering discovery of the charmoniumlike resonance @xmath3 by belle collaboration in 2003 belle:2003 ( see , also refs .",
    "@xcite ) , numerous exotic particles were observed and studied .",
    "now they are organized as the @xmath4 family of the exotic particles . during passed years ,",
    "experimental and theoretical investigation of these particles achieved evident successes in measurements of their masses and decay widths , in exploring spins and parities , as well as in creating various theoretical models and schemes to reveal their internal structure and compute corresponding parameters ( see for instance swanson:2006st , klempt:2007cp , godfrey:2008nc , voloshin:2007dx , nielsen:2010 , faccini:2012pj , esposito:2014rxa , chen:2016 and references therein ) .",
    "recently , due to the observation of the resonance structure reported by the d0 collaboration in ref .",
    "@xcite , this interest to unusual hadrons is renewed .",
    "really , in accordance with this observation , the new narrow resonance @xmath0 ( in what follows denoted as @xmath5 or @xmath6 ) contains four valence quarks and belongs to the class of the exotic states .",
    "but what is important , the @xmath5 is probably the first hadronic state built of four - quarks of different flavors , namely @xmath7 and @xmath8 quarks , which makes it a very interesting object for the experimental and theoretical studies .",
    "the d0 collaboration measured its mass , width of the dominant decay channel @xmath9 , and assigned the quantum numbers @xmath10 to this resonance as preferable ones . moreover , in ref .",
    "d0:2016mwd some suggestions concerning the structure of the @xmath5 were made , as well .",
    "thus , the @xmath5 may be considered as a diquark - antidiquark bound state within the tetraquark model of the exotic states .",
    "alternatively , @xmath6 may be studied as a molecule composed of @xmath11 and @xmath12 mesons .    nevertheless , despite the experimental information on the @xmath5 state provided by the d0 collaboration ,",
    "the lhcb collaboration has not still confirmed the d0 observation , as they announced in a preliminary report lhcb:2016 .",
    "this situation demands intensive experimental and theoretical explorations of its features to answer questions on the nature of the observed state .",
    "the information of the d0 collaboration led to burst of activity in the relevant theoretical studies .",
    "it started immediately after discovery of the exotic @xmath5 state and employed almost all possible scenarios to explain its observed parameters .",
    "in fact , in refs .",
    "agaev:2016mjb , agaev:2016ijz we calculated the mass , decay constant and width of the @xmath5 state within the diquark - antidiquark picture @xmath13[\\bar{b}\\bar{d}]$ ] considering the exotic state with positive charge .",
    "our results for the mass @xmath14 , and for the width of its decay @xmath15 are in a good agreement with the experimental data .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we extended our investigation of the new family of the four - quark exotic states by considering the charmed partner of the @xmath6 state , and assuming that the @xmath16 state is composed of the @xmath17 and @xmath18 quarks .",
    "we also supposed that @xmath16 possesses the same quantum numbers as @xmath6 .",
    "we computed the mass , decay constant and width of the decays @xmath19 and @xmath20 considering @xmath21 as @xmath22[\\bar{c}\\bar{d}]$ ] diquark - antidiquark state and employing two forms for the interpolating currents .",
    "the mass of the @xmath6 state was also estimated in refs .",
    "wang:2016tsi , chen:2016mqt , zanetti:2016wjn , wang:2016mee using the diquark - antidiquark model .",
    "the width of the decay channel @xmath23 was calculated in ref .",
    "dias:2016dme , wang:2016wkj in the framework of the three - point qcd sum rule approach , and good agreement between the theoretical predictions for @xmath24 and experimental data was reported . as a bound state of the @xmath11 and @xmath12 mesons",
    "the exotic @xmath25 particle was studied in ref .",
    "some questions of quark - antiquark organization of @xmath6 and its partners were addressed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    the controversial information of the d0 and lhcb collaborations triggered an appearance of interesting theoretical works devoted to analysis of the @xmath6 physics . in these papers",
    "numerous aspects of the @xmath6 problems , including investigations of its structure and parameters , analysis some of production mechanisms are covered . for details and further explanations",
    "we refer to original works he:2016yhd , jin:2016cpv , stancu:2016sfd , burns:2016gvy , tang:2016pcf , guo:2016nhb , lu:2016zhe , esposito:2016itg , albaladejo:2016eps , ali:2016gdg .    in the present article",
    "we continue our investigation of the exotic state @xmath26 by supposing that it can be considered as a meson molecule . in other words , we assume that @xmath6 is a molecule - like state composed of @xmath27 and @xmath28 mesons .",
    "we are going to calculate its mass , decay constant and width of the decay channel using the corresponding molecule - type interpolating current and theoretical methods presented in rather detailed form in refs .",

    "our aim is to answer the question : has the exotic @xmath29 state observed by the d0 collaboration the structure of a meson molecule or it is a tightly - bound tetraquark state ?",
    "this work is organized in the following way . in section [ sec : mass ]",
    "we introduce the interpolating current employed in qcd sum rule calculations . here",
    "we derive the sum rules to evaluate the mass , decay constant and width of the decay @xmath30 . in sect .  [",
    "sec : num ] we present results of numerical calculations and compare them with experimental data and theoretical predictions .",
    "this section contains also our conclusions .",
    "explicit expressions for the spectral density required for computation of the mass and decay constant of the @xmath6 state are collected in appendix a.",
    "in this section we derive qcd sum rule expressions necessary to calculate the mass , current coupling and width of the @xmath30 decay employing a molecule - type interpolating current .",
    "the ways of calculations have been considered in detailed form in our previous papers , therefore we write down below only expressions that are new and differ from ones presented there .    for calculation of the mass and current coupling we use the two - point qcd sum rule and start from the correlation function @xmath31where",
    "@xmath32 is the interpolating current with required quantum numbers .",
    "we consider @xmath29 state as a particle with the quantum numbers @xmath33 . in the meson molecule scheme the current @xmath32 is given by @xmath34 \\left [ \\overline{b}^{b}(x)\\gamma_{5}u^{b}(x)\\right ] ,   \\label{eq : cdiq1}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are color indices .",
    "the standard procedures for deriving qcd sum rules include at first stage computation of the correlation function in terms of the physical degrees of freedom . the final expression , which one uses to get the relevant sum rule , is the borel transformed form of the function @xmath37 . in the case under consideration it is given as @xmath38    the second step is to find the theoretical expression for the same function , @xmath39 , employing the quark - gluon degrees of freedom .",
    "to this end , contracting the quark fields for the correlation function @xmath40 we find : @xmath41   \\notag \\\\ & & \\times \\mathrm{tr}\\left [ \\gamma _ { 5}s_{u}^{bb^{\\prime } } ( x)\\gamma _ { 5}s_{b}^{b^{\\prime } b}(-x)\\right ] ,   \\label{eq : corrf2}\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the light ( @xmath44or @xmath45 ) and @xmath36-quark propagators , respectively .",

    "the gluon field strength tensor @xmath53 is fixed at @xmath54    the correlation function @xmath55 is given by a simple dispersion integral @xmath56where @xmath57 is the corresponding spectral density .",
    "we have calculated the spectral density by including into analysis the quark , gluon and mixed condensates up to eight dimensions .",
    "our result for @xmath58 is moved to appendix a.    applying the borel transformation on the variable @xmath59 to the invariant amplitude @xmath55 , equating the obtained expression to @xmath60 , and subtracting the continuum contribution , we finally obtain the required sum rules .",
    "thus , the mass of the @xmath29 state can be evaluated from the sum rule @xmath61whereas for the decay constant @xmath62 we employ the formula @xmath63    in order to find the width of @xmath64 decay , we start from calculation of the strong coupling @xmath65 using qcd sum rule on the light - cone and soft - meson approximation .",

    "@xmath79 is the full set of dirac matrixes @xmath80and determine the required local matrix elements . for this purpose",
    ", we first perform summation over the color indices . to clarify the computational scheme , let us take a term @xmath81 from the b - quark propagator and terms @xmath82 from the s - quark propagator considering by this way , terms without gluon contributions .",

    "one needs only to remove color factors from the propagators and use the prescriptions given above .    omitting technical details , which can be found in refs .",

    "then , the final sum rule to evaluate the strong coupling reads @xmath101    the width of the decay @xmath102 can be found applying the standard methods .",

    "the qcd sum rules derived above contain numerous parameters ( see , table [ tab : param ] ) , which have to be fixed in accordance with the usual procedures .",
    "thus , for numerical computation of the @xmath29 state s mass and decay constant we need values of the quark , gluon and mixed condensates . for the various vacuum condensates we use their",
    "well known values . in this range",
    "the gluon condensate @xmath106 is relatively new parameter , for which we employ the estimate given in ref .",
    "the qcd sum rules contain also @xmath36 and @xmath45 quark masses , and depend on @xmath107 meson s mass and decay constant @xmath108 . in the present work ,",
    "we choose the mass of the @xmath36 quark in the @xmath109 scheme at the scale @xmath110 , whereas the decay constant @xmath108 is borrowed from the lattice calculations from ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the expressions evaluated within the qcd sum rule method additionally depend on the continuum threshold and borel parameters , i.e. on @xmath111 and @xmath112 , respectively .",
    "one needs to fix some regions where physical quantities under consideration are practically independent or demonstrate weak dependence on them . to find the working window for the borel parameter",
    ", we require the convergence of the operator product expansion , as well as suppression of the contributions arising from the higher resonances and continuum , in other words exceeding of the pole contribution over the ones coming from the higher dimensional condensates . as a result ,",
    "for the mass and current coupling calculations we find the range of @xmath113 as @xmath114the continuum threshold depends on the energy of the first excited state with the same quantum numbers and structure as the particle under consideration . in the case of the exotic states ,",
    "it is difficult to determine unambiguously this energy level , therefore we have to follow standard recipes adopted in the sum rule computations and vary @xmath111 within the following region by considering the resonance of the d0 collaboration as a ground state @xmath115results of our numerical calculations of @xmath116 and @xmath62 are depicted in figs .",
    "[ fig : mass ] and [ fig : decconst ] .",
    "it is not difficult to conclude that , in the chosen region the dependence of the mass and decay constant on the parameter @xmath112 is insignificant . at the same time , obtained predictions depend on the threshold parameter @xmath117 , which is the main source of the uncertainty of the sum rule computations",
    ". variations of other parameters within allowed limits give rise to errors , as well .",
    "the using in the leading order sum rule expression the running quark mass @xmath118 , which in the lack of an information on the next - to - leading order correction necessary to fix the renormalization scheme and scale , also generates ambiguity .",
    "we treat the ambiguity arising because of the choice of the renormalization scale @xmath119 as an additional source of the theoretical error , and include its effect to the total error of the sum rule results presented below .    hence",
    ", considering @xmath29 as the molecule state composed of the @xmath11 and @xmath120 mesons , for its mass we obtain @xmath121whereas the experimental value of the d0 collaboration is equal to @xmath122for the decay constant @xmath62 we get @xmath123the coupling @xmath124 extracted from the sum rule expression eq .",

    "this discrepancy is essential in the case of the mass , which is slightly less than the mass threshold of the @xmath2 system @xmath130 , and differs significantly from the experimental value of the d0 collaboration . at the same time , the corresponding predictions obtained in ref .  @xcite using the diquark - antidiquark model for the @xmath6 state lead to a good agreement with experimental data of the d0 collaboration .",
    "the qcd sum rule predictions for the mass and decay width extracted in the present work by employing the molecule type interpolating current suffer from the large uncertainties . but such errors are inherent in the sum rule calculations , and are unavoidable part of the whole picture .",
    "the same conclusion is valid for the diquark - antidiquark current , as well .",
    "these two results have large overlap region making conclusive decision on the nature of the @xmath6 state rather problematic .",
    "nevertheless , our results for the parameters of the @xmath6 state derived in the meson - molecule picture and their comparison with ones evaluated by applying the diquark - antidiquark model strengthen our confidence that if an exotic state @xmath6 with the parameters of the d0 collaboration exists , the diquark - antidiquark form for its internal organization is more acceptable than configuration of a molecule built of the @xmath11 and @xmath12 mesons .    in the present work we have performed qcd sum rule analysis of the exotic @xmath131 state by treating it as a molecule composed of the @xmath11 and @xmath132 mesons .",
    "we have calculated the mass @xmath116 and width of the decay @xmath133 , and compared our results with the experimental data , as well as with predictions of the diquark - antidiquark picture . from the present analysis",
    "we conclude that the molecule model for the exotic @xmath29 state is less suitable than the diquark - antidiquark one to explain its parameters measured by the d0 collaboration .",

    "<S> the parameters , i.e. the mass and current coupling of the exotic @xmath0 state observed by the d0 collaboration as well as the decay width of the process @xmath1 are explored using @xmath2 molecule assumption on its structure . employed computational methods include qcd two - point and light - cone sum rules , latter being considered in the soft - meson approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained results are compared with the data of the d0 collaboration as well as with the predictions of the diquark - antidiquark model . </S>",
    "<S> this comparison strengthens a diquark - antidiquark picture for the @xmath0 state rather than a meson molecule structure . </S>"
