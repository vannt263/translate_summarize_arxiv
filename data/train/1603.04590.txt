    "there is a double - peak structure of the @xmath22- ( @xmath11 @xmath23 780 ev ) and @xmath24- ( @xmath11 @xmath23 794 ev ) edges due to the co 2@xmath9 core - hole spin - orbit coupling in all spectra .",
    "the overall spectral features are mutually consistent among these three spectra without showing a serious peak shift , indicating that we have successfully obtained the intrinsic xas spectra . on the other hand , there are some detailed discrepancies among the spectra . a shoulder structure at @xmath11 = 779 ev in the spectra in the tey and pey modes is markedly suppressed in the pfy spectrum . on the basis of the probing depth of each mode @xcite , we can judge that this shoulder would be due to a surface contribution deviated from the bulk ones . between the two main @xmath10-edge peaks ,",
    "another shoulder is seen at @xmath11 = 782 ev in both tey and pey spectra , being overlapped with an asymmetric tail in the pfy spectrum .",
    "such an asymmetric tail is also seen on the high-@xmath11 side of the @xmath24 edge in the pfy spectrum .",
    "these tails would originate from so - called self - absorption effects  @xcite , by which the spectral shape can be deviated from the intrinsic one .",

    "this fact suggests that the intrinsic co",
    "@xmath10-edge xas spectral weight is remarkably weaker than the background yielded by high - energy tails of the c , n , o @xmath7-edge absorptions caused by a tiny co element ratio as c : n : o : co = 46 : 2 : 8 : 1 for [ co\\{au(pph@xmath1)(d - pen)}@xmath2clo@xmath3 . in the pey mode , on the other hand , the background is relatively weaker than the co @xmath10-edge xas spectral weight owing to the suppression of the contribution of electrons with their kinetic energy less than 550 ev to the spectral intensity .",
    "this background increases slightly and linearly with @xmath11 , as shown in fig.[peyteypfy](b ) .",
    "therefore , we have concluded that the spectrum in the pey mode is the most reliable for the quantitative discussions shown below although it is relatively surface - sensitive .",

    "higher than the main peaks called as a charge - transfer satellite is negligible .",
    "such a satellite originates from hybridizations between the co 3@xmath0 and ligands @xmath9 orbitals described by configuration interactions on the basis of the cluster model  @xcite or anderson impurity model  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the absence of the satellite suggests that these spectra can be well explained by local ion models without explicitly considering the hybridization effects .",
