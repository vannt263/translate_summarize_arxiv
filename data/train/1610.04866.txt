    "the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) , sometimes called gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) is a paradigmatic model for nonlinear systems .",
    "different versions have been used in diverse contexts including , _",
    "optics @xcite , plasma physics @xcite and even in cosmology @xcite .",
    "it describes with precision most of the physics of bose - einstein condensed ( bec ) dilute gases @xcite . with an attractive nonlinearity , the wavefunction can self - focus and collapse , diverging at some point of space in finite time @xcite",
    "this can happen in cold atom becs when the scattering length @xmath0 controlling the effective atom - atom interaction is negative @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon , sometimes nicknamed `` bosenova '' because of the subsequent explosion , has been demonstrated in a series of experiments which have attained a notable degree of control @xcite and modeled using gpe @xcite .",
    "there is a vast literature on collapses in gpe / nlse , comprising analytic results , numerics and experiments @xcite .",
    "altogether , the standard lore is that collapse happens as soon as some parameter of the initial state , for example the overall energy or the peak value , surpasses some threshold . near collapse",
    ", solutions typically display self - similarities @xcite .    in a totally different arena",
    ", collapses have also been studied in general relativity ( gr ) , in relation to black hole ( bh ) formation . in asymptotically flat space , a critical value for a given parameter marks the limit between collapse and dispersion to infinity of the initial matter distribution @xcite .",
    "remarkably , solutions at threshold also display extremely interesting self - similarities both of discrete and continuous type @xcite .    in recent times , a modified version of this gravitational phenomenology has been explored in anti de sitter ( ads ) , the maximally symmetric spacetime with negative curvature .",
    "the most dramatic difference is that space becomes effectively bounded .",
    "initial conditions that do not form a bh right away , reach the boundary and bounce , falling back again towards the origin with a different radial profile .",
    "the surprising result of @xcite is that , no matter how small the initial amplitude , collapse eventually happens after a number of bounces of the matter field against the boundary .",
    "the initial claim was that the underlying mechanism is an energy cascade triggered by a fully resonant spectrum of the linearized perturbations .",
    "later , the picture has proved to be more intricate and has thereby become a subject of intense research .",
    "it seems natural to look for analogue features in other nonlinear systems . in this work ,",
    "we have set up an efficient numerical code for radially symmetric long time simulations of the gpe . in order to reproduce features of the scalar field in ads ,",
    "we consider a quadratic potential , whose spectrum is fully resonant .",
    "moreover , this potential typically models bec traps and thus the framework is closely related to bosenovae .",
    "mathematical properties of the gpe in a harmonic trap has been studied elsewhere @xcite .",
    "our setup is similar in spirit to the evolution of a probe scalar in ads @xcite .",
    "we perform series simulations with decreasing initial amplitude in different number of dimensions @xmath1 .",
    "below threshold for direct collapse , a singularity is reached after a number of oscillations .",
    "we refer to these as `` delayed collapses '' following the nomenclature from the gr context @xcite .",
    "we see a stepwise structure of delayed collapses . in the physical @xmath2 case ,",
    "our plots resemble those of wide initial gaussians in ads @xcite , or those of theories with a mass gap for bh formation , such as ads@xmath3 @xcite , einstein - maxwell - scalar @xcite or einstein - gauss - bonnet @xcite .",
    "there are plateaux for which collapses occur after a number of bounces and transition regions where the collapsing time becomes a chaotic function of the initial amplitude . below some amplitude",
    ", we do not find collapse in computational time . in @xmath4 ,",
    "our results become surprisingly similar to those of @xcite .",
    "the wavefunction @xmath5 , evolving in a @xmath1-dimensional harmonic isotropic trap @xmath6 with cubic focusing nonlinearity , is governed by @xmath7 without loss of generality , we use dimensionless quantities and give in the appendix the well - known rescaling from the dimensionful bec variables .",
    "the norm and hamiltonian are conserved @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the integral over the angles , _ e.g. _",
    "@xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "an important indicator is the variance @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath13 implies collapse , but collapses can occur with @xmath14 .",
    "a straightforward calculation shows that @xmath15 satisfies the virial identity @xmath16 in order to connect the setup to weak turbulence @xcite , the evolution equation can be rewritten in terms of modes by taking @xmath17 where the @xmath18 are the orthonormal basis of eigenfunctions of the linear problem ( see appendix )",
    ". we now insert ( [ modes ] ) in ( [ gp ] ) , project on the @xmath19 and assume that the rate of change of the @xmath20 is much lower than that of the complex exponentials .",
    "this multiscale analysis is standard and goes under different names : rotating wave approximation , two - time formalism @xcite , averaging @xcite , etc . we find @xmath21 where @xmath22 the two conserved quantities ( [ norm ] ) , ( [ hamiltonian ] ) ( as in @xcite ) and the coincidence of the only resonant channel , @xmath23 , relate closely the gpe formalism to the ads setup @xcite , and imply the coexistence of direct and inverse energy cascades .",
    "an important ingredient is the family of initial conditions .",
    "we use gaussians of width @xmath24 and amplitude @xmath25 @xmath26 the choice is motivated by simplicity and the discussion is not significantly affected by this particular shape .",
    "( [ ini ] ) gives the ground state of the linear problem in which the harmonic potential has an extra @xmath27 factor .",
    "hence one can think of the processes we simulate as quenches in which at @xmath28 the linear and/or nonlinear potentials are abruptly modified initiating the dynamical evolution . in becs , this is accomplished by tuning external fields which not only constitute the harmonic trap but do severely affect the atom - atom scattering length near feshbach resonances @xcite .",
    "our work relies on numerical integration of eq .",
    "( [ gp ] ) .",
    "the reader interested in the methods can find all the details in the appendix .",
    "we start by briefly commenting on @xmath29 . in becs",
    ", this limit is achieved with a strongly anisotropic trap leading to a disk - shaped condensate @xcite . in the absence of external potential ,",
    "the townes profile @xcite marks the limit between directly collapsing waves and those dispersing to infinity .",
    "the harmonic potential changes the picture , permitting stable stationary solutions @xcite .",
    "we have not found any set of initial conditions yielding the sought structure of delayed collapses and below threshold solutions remain regular for all times .    in @xmath2 without trapping potential , there is also a sharp separation between direct collapse and dispersion . with a harmonic potential , apart from having periodic stationary solutions @xcite , delayed collapses are possible .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows several examples in which a divergence of @xmath30 is reached after several oscillations .",
    "this number of oscillations can be adjusted by fine - tuning the initial conditions .    .",
    "we depict the value of @xmath31 for @xmath32 and varying @xmath25 . in each case",
    ", the wavefunction promptly collapses after hitting the upper limit of the plot . in panel",
    "( a ) , ordered by growing @xmath33 , we have @xmath34 . notice the approximate overlap for long ranges of @xmath35 . in panel ( b ) , @xmath36 results in collapse after many bounces . ]    in figure [ fig2 ]",
    ", we plot the time of collapse , @xmath33 , as a function of @xmath25 for fixed @xmath37 . in the cold atom framework , tuning @xmath25 is equivalent to tuning the scattering length .",
    "thus , this plot depicts the same observable as , _",
    "e.g. _ , fig . 2 of @xcite .",
    "in @xmath2 .",
    "prompt collapse occurs for @xmath38 .",
    "the resolution of the peak at the transition @xmath39 exhibits a chaotic structure ( in the inset ) . ]",
    "there are three distinct regions . for large @xmath25",
    "there is direct collapse and @xmath33 decreases with growing @xmath25 . for small @xmath25 solutions",
    "stay regular within computational time .",
    "there is a noteworthy intermediate transition region where some step structure is apparent ( cf .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . roughly speaking",
    ", each step corresponds to a number of bounces in the harmonic potential . at the boundary between steps",
    ", @xmath33 has a bump .",
    "our plot shows remarkable features in common with those found in different ads setups ( cf . figs . 9 in @xcite , 3 in @xcite , 16 in @xcite or 2 in @xcite ) .",
    "the chaotic character of the curve at the bumps has been recently established in @xcite .",
    "the common feature of these examples seems to be the lack of fully resonant linearized perturbations around a standing wave @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] depicts a map of the results obtained with different @xmath25 and @xmath24 .",
    "the transition line between prompt and delayed collapse can be defined with precision . on the other hand , regularity of evolution",
    "can only be stated within a given computational time , which we have fixed to @xmath40 .",
    "the delayed collapse window is certainly narrow in the two - parameter space of initial conditions .    .",
    "the dashed line signals the transition from initial conditions where @xmath41 changes from negative ( above ) to positive ( below ) .",
    "all delayed collapses happen with @xmath14 . ]",
    "as mentioned above , our interest in looking for delayed collapses in gpe was sparked by the similar problem in the gravitational context of a scalar field coupled to gravity and a negative cosmological constant .",
    "now we can reverse the lore , and ask ourselves what we can learn from this nonlinear system in regard to the important question of the instability of ads .",
    "in fact , one advantage of this simple equation is the fact that we can tweak separate features independently , like the property of full resonance or the character of the nonlinearity .",
    "these features are utterly mixed in the gravitational setup and are difficult to disentangle @xcite .",
    "there is growing consensus that the weak turbulent instability of ads , _ i.e. _ , that initial data always collapse in the limit @xmath42 , is not solely caused by a fully resonant spectrum .",
    "this being a necessary condition , needs to be supplemented with appropriate asymptotics for the coupling coefficients @xmath43 ( [ coefs ] ) at large values of @xmath44 in a resonant channel .",
    "this should trigger efficient energy transfer to the high frequency modes . in the three - dimensional gpe",
    ", we have checked that @xmath45 behaves with @xmath46 as a power @xmath47 with @xmath48 .",
    "this is substantially lower a growth than the one observed in @xmath49 where @xmath50 in this channel @xcite ( in order to compare the resonant system in ads with ours in eq .",
    "( [ modevol ] ) , the modes @xmath51 need to be rescaled to @xmath52 .",
    "this shifts @xmath53 ) .",
    "a natural question is what minimal twist could we perform in order to enhance the asymptotics , and whether this would have the expected impact on the collapse at low values of the initial amplitude .",
    "one possibility is to include derivative terms , ( derivative couplings appear in the effective equations for a scalar field coupled to gravity ) .",
    "in fact , a term of the form @xmath54 added to the gpe yields @xmath55 .",
    "the numerical evolution of the system with this additional term becomes unstable and we have deferred its study .    another artificial but efficient way to enhance @xmath56 is to formally extend the gpe to higher dimensions . in figure",
    "[ fig4 ] , we depict the behavior of @xmath57 for @xmath58 and @xmath59 . in the large @xmath60 limit the exponent @xmath56 behaves with the dimension as ( see the appendix ) @xmath61 a fact that presumably causes the different qualitative behavior between @xmath29 and @xmath2 .",
    "this suggests that turbulence and collapse are favored at large @xmath1 .",
    "this expectation is borne out by the results of figure [ fig5 ] , which shows a neat step structure for @xmath62 when @xmath4 , resembling @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "we also display the results with a slightly modified potential @xmath64 , where @xmath65 corresponds to the harmonic case .",
    "changing @xmath66 modifies the eigenvalues of the linear problem , breaking full resonance . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] this has a dramatic impact on the time of collapse at low initial amplitudes .     as a function of @xmath60 for different values of @xmath1 . in the inset ,",
    "we depict the @xmath67 , showing that they present a similar behavior . ]     vs. @xmath25 for @xmath4 with @xmath68 and @xmath64 .",
    "two non - resonant cases @xmath69 and @xmath70 present limiting values of @xmath25 below which no singularity is reached in computational time . the harmonic resonant case @xmath65 ( eq . ( [ gp ] ) ) shows a regularly spaced set of steps extending to much lower values of @xmath25 . ]",
    "collapses in gpe / nlse have been thoroughly studied but are still a fascinating topic .",
    "we have studied the long time evolution of the wave function in a trap , modeled by a harmonic potential . in @xmath2 , we have seen that there are initial conditions that lead to delayed collapses , where the divergence occurs after a number of oscillations . on average ,",
    "the time of collapse grows with the inverse of the norm of the initial wavefunction , but non - monotonically and with a strong sensitivity to the initial condition .",
    "this happens in a region of parameter space which separates direct collapse from absence of collapse .",
    "natural questions are how generic this behavior is and under which circumstances it can appear .    one intriguing answer is given by comparing to a scalar field in ads gravity which shows remarkable similarities .",
    "the gpe evolution equations are much simpler than those of ads gravity , and their study might be instrumental in understanding which peculiarities of general relativity are essential for the delayed collapse behavior and which are shared by other kinds of nonlinear systems .",
    "for instance , the behavior of the @xmath43 coefficients ( [ coefs ] ) can be tuned by considering larger dimensions , nontrivial spatial profiles for the nonlinear coupling or other generalizations of eq .",
    "( [ gp ] ) . studying the @xmath4 case ,",
    "we have shown that turbulence is enhanced by the rapidly growing @xmath43 and that breaking the full resonance by tuning the potential sharply affects the long time evolution .",
    "the gpe / nlse is an ubiquitous formalism in nonlinear waves , and this fact can pave the way for tabletop experiments with analogies to ads gravity .",
    "the experimental control reached in becs might provide an ideal framework to realize the delayed collapse phenomenology .",
    "our formalism is not a complete description of any such system since , for instance , it does not include anisotropies or losses by three - body recombinations .",
    "however , our results suggest that it might be worth revisiting , theoretically and/or experimentally , the transition from a stable bec with attractive nonlinearity to a bosenova collapse ( cf .",
    "fig . 2 of @xcite ) .",
    "depending on the width of the initial wavefunction , @xmath33 can decrease with the strength of the interaction @xmath71 , a counterintuitive behavior .",
    "moreover , there are narrow regions of parameter space where @xmath33 changes chaotically . whether these properties stemming from eq .",
    "( [ gp ] ) can be consequential in a realistic setup is a challenging question for the future .",
    "in this appendix we lay out some technicalities related to the main text .",
    "first , in order to be reasonably self - contained , we write down some useful well - known equations concerning the rescaling of gross - pitaevskii equations ( gpe ) and the radially symmetric eigenmodes of a harmonic potential in @xmath72 dimensions . then , we specify some details regarding the employed numerical methods and cross - checks .      the gross - pitaevskii mean - field description of a dilute bose - einstein condensate of bosons of mass @xmath73 in an isotropic harmonic potential of frequency @xmath74 is : @xmath75 where @xmath0 is the s - wave scattering length which can be positive ( repulsive interaction ) or negative ( attractive interaction ) and @xmath76 is the number of bosons in the sample .",
    "tilded symbols represent physical quantities as opposed to the dimensionless ones of the main text . the relation between them",
    "is given by : @xmath77 inserting these expressions in ( [ gpdim ] ) , taking @xmath78 and assuming that @xmath79 only depends on @xmath35 and @xmath80 we get the differential equation studied in the main text .",
    "it is immediate to compute the relation between the normalization of both conventions : @xmath81      the angle - independent solutions of the linear harmonic oscillator problem : @xmath82 with @xmath72 can be written as : @xmath83 the eigenvalues are : @xmath84 and the eigenfunctions take the form : @xmath85 the @xmath86 are generalized laguerre polynomials , @xmath87 represents euler s gamma function and the multiplicative constant is chosen to satisfy the orthonormality condition : @xmath88 where : @xmath89        in the region of delayed collapses , small changes in initial conditions can lead to rather different results .",
    "thus , a method for fast , stable and precise computation is needed and it is worth to briefly describe here the one we have used .",
    "our integration algorithm relies on an explicit finite difference scheme consistent with fourth order accuracy and convergence .",
    "spatial derivatives are discretized with standard stencils , and time evolution uses a fourth order runge - kutta .",
    "the courant factor , @xmath91 , depends on the discretization density since the equation is parabolic .",
    "stability enforces this number to be quite small . for @xmath92 points in the spatial grid ,",
    "we have used @xmath93 with @xmath94 .    at the origin ,",
    "we ensure regularity by enforcing @xmath95 .",
    "the harmonic potential confines the wavefunction and therefore @xmath79 decays exponentially with @xmath80 .",
    "we have checked that choosing @xmath96 keeps @xmath97 so that setting its value to zero , and truncating @xmath80 to a finite interval @xmath98 , does not affect the simulation .",
    "we have also performed computations using a truly compact coordinate @xmath99 and found consistent results .",
    "we have used the conservation of the norm ( [ norm ] ) , the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , and the variance identity ( [ variance ] ) , as quality tests to monitor the computation . for initial conditions of the form ( [ ini ] ) ,",
    "they take the values @xmath100 the value of the second derivative of the variance at @xmath28 is : @xmath101 we define the relative deviations @xmath102 , @xmath103 where @xmath104 , @xmath105 are the values obtained from numerical integration and @xmath106 , @xmath107 are the values given in ( [ hn ] ) . to keep them satisfied at relative orders @xmath108 we have implemented global ( in space ) refinement .",
    "this is seen to be required when the profile becomes extremely sharp at the origin , and needs more resolution to keep numerical control .",
    "[ fig6 ] depicts a check for one of the simulations yielding a delayed collapse .    ,",
    "@xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 .",
    "panel ( a ) represents @xmath112 at the origin .",
    "panels ( b ) and ( c ) depict the relative deviations for the norm and hamiltonian , respectively .",
    "panel ( d ) compares the second derivative of the variance from the numerical computation to that from the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ variance ] ) computed at each step .",
    "finally , panel ( e ) shows the convergence level along the whole simulation . on a grid of @xmath92 points ,",
    "@xmath113 where @xmath114 stands for a @xmath115 norm .",
    "the plot shows convergence at fourth order with high accuracy .",
    "the tests show that the numerical method is reliable until times very near collapse . ]",
    "we have implemented our codes for cpu computation and , in order to speed up the simulation , we also adapted them for gpgpu .",
    "the computation times that we achieve are approximately one order of magnitud lower in the latter case .",
    "we now obtain the asymptotically large @xmath60 behaviour of @xmath116 .",
    "the form of the coefficients is given by the integral in ( [ coefs ] ) for the eigenfunctions of eq .",
