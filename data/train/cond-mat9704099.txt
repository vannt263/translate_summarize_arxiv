    "our paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sec : theory ] we briefly review the principal features of the scaling arguments of fisher and coworkers , and show that in addition to the previously predicted singularity in @xmath9 , they also imply singular behaviour in the _ diameter _ of the liquid - gas coexistence curve at the critical end point . in section  [ sec : mc ] we detail extensive monte - carlo simulations of a symmetrical ( lennard - jones ) binary fluid mixture .",

    "the energy penalty associated with contacts between unlike particles is small and hence there is little incentive for phase separation unless the temperature is very low and the density very high .",

    "ergodically the phase space of the model , two sorts of monte - carlo action are necessary .",
    "the first is a particle transfer step in which one attempts either to insert a particle at a randomly chosen position , or alternatively , to delete a randomly chosen existing particle .",
    "candidate particles for insertion are assigned a species type ( @xmath69 or @xmath70 ) with equal probability .",
    "the second sort of action is an identity swop , in which one chooses an existing particle at random and attempts to change its identity ( @xmath97 or @xmath98 ) .",
    "combined use of these operations samples the grand canonical ensemble in which the particle density @xmath99 , energy density @xmath100 and number difference density @xmath101 all fluctuate .    in accordance with convention , we shall employ dimensionless units to express our data :    @xmath102    @xmath103    we also note for future reference that our algorithm utilises not the true chemical potential @xmath1 , but an effective chemical potential @xmath104 to which the true chemical potential is related by    @xmath105    where @xmath106 is the chemical potential in the non - interacting ( ideal gas ) limit .",
    "it is this effective value that features in the results that follows .",
    "in the course of the simulations , three systems sizes of volume @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 were studied , corresponding to average particle numbers @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 respectively at the critical end point ( whose location we discuss below ) .",
    "following equilibration , runs comprising up to @xmath113 mcs @xcite were performed and the joint distribution @xmath114 was sampled approximately every @xmath115 mcs and accumulated in the form of a histogram . for each @xmath116 , simulations were carried out at several ( typically @xmath117 ) temperatures along the liquid - gas coexistence curve .    in order to locate the liquid - gas coexistence curve , the finite - size form of the density distribution @xmath118",
    "was studied . precisely at coexistence",
    ", @xmath118 is ( to within corrections exponentially small in @xmath116 ) double peaked with equal weight in both peaks @xcite .",
    "for a given simulation temperature , this ` equal weight ' criterion can be used to determine the coexistence chemical potential to high accuracy .",
    "close to the liquid - gas critical point i.e. when @xmath119 , this task is straightforward ; one simple tunes the chemical potential at constant @xmath0 until the measured form of @xmath118 is double peaked .",
    "by contrast , however , in the strongly first order regime ( @xmath120 ) , this approach can not be used to obtain the coexistence form of @xmath118 due to the large free energy barrier separating the coexisting phases .",
    "this barrier leads to metastability effects and prohibitively long correlation times . to circumvent this difficulty one must employ advanced sampling schemes .",
    "one such scheme is the multicanonical preweighting method @xcite which encourages the simulation to sample the interfacial configurations of intrinsically low probability .",
    "this is achieved by incorporating a suitably chosen weight function in the monte - carlo update probabilities .",
    "the weights are subsequently ` folded out ' from the sampled distribution to yield the correct boltzmann distributed quantities .",
    "use of this method permits the direct measurement of the order parameter probability distribution at first order phase transitions , even when the distribution spans many decades of probability .    to fully capitalise on the data gathered in the simulations ,",
    "the histogram reweighting technique @xcite was employed .",
    "this technique rests on the observation that histograms accumulated at one set of model parameters can be reweighted to yield estimates of histograms appropriate to another set of not - too - distant parameters .",
    "results from individual simulation runs at different parameters can also be combined in a systematic fashion to provide information over larger regions of the phase diagram . when used in tandem with multicanonical preweighting ,",
    "the histogram reweighting technique constitutes a powerful tool for mapping the coexistence curve properties of continuum fluid models @xcite .    using the multicanonical preweighting technique , simulations of the liquid - gas coexistence curve of the binary fluid",
    "were performed . to begin with ,",
    "the region near the liquid - gas critical point was studied since there the free energy barrier between the coexisting phases is small and no preweighting function is need .",
    "thereafter , the temperature was reduced in a stepwise fashion and the coexistence form of @xmath118 was collected . for each successively lower temperature studied , histogram reweighting was used to obtain a suitable preweighting function by extrapolating from the coexistence histograms previously obtained at higher temperatures .",
    "further details concerning this strategy have been given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : cxdists](a ) shows the resulting coexistence forms of @xmath118 for the system of size @xmath121 , at a selection of temperatures in the range @xmath122 .",
    "also shown in figure  [ fig : cxdists](b ) is the same data expressed on a log scale .",
    "the corresponding estimates for the coexistence chemical potential and the coexistence diameter are plotted in figures  [ fig : mut ] and  [ fig : rhod ] respectively .",
    "the gas and liquid densities required for the diameter calculation were obtained as the average densities of the respective peaks of @xmath118 .",
    "it is interesting to note from figure  [ fig : cxdists](b ) , that for the lowest temperature studied ( @xmath123 ) , the ratio of minimum to maximum in the distribution is approximately @xmath124 .",
    "a free energy barrier of this magnitude would , of course , represent an insurmountable obstacle to phase space evolution , were it not for the use of multicanonical preweighting .",
    "it is also instructive to examine the coexistence behaviour of the number difference order parameter distribution @xmath125 , for temperatures above and below @xmath126 , as shown in figure  [ fig : magdists ] .",
    "well below @xmath126 , this distribution is three - peaked , with one narrow peak centered on @xmath127 and two broader peaks centered on positive and negative values of @xmath128 .",
    "the peak at @xmath127 corresponds to the disordered gas phase , while the degenerate peaks at positive and negative values of @xmath76 represent the ordered @xmath129-rich and @xmath130-rich liquid phases respectively .",
    "as one approaches the critical end point , however , the liquid peaks become broader and overlap with the gas phase peak , ultimately leaving just one single peak at @xmath127 for @xmath13 .    to determine the locus of the @xmath6-line and the critical end point in which it formally terminates , finite - size scaling ( fss ) methods were employed . on the @xmath6-line",
    ", criticality is signalled by the asymptotic scale invariance of @xmath131 .",
    "a useful dimensionless measure of the form of this distribution is its fourth order cumulant ratio @xmath132 @xcite . if one plots @xmath133 for a given constant @xmath134 , one expects the curves for each @xmath116 to intersect at the critical de - mixing temperature . for binary fluids with short ranged interactions , the critical behaviour on the @xmath6-line and the critical end point @xcite",
    "is expected to be ising like .",
    "one thus expects that asymptotically ( for sufficiently large @xmath116 ) there will be a unique crossing point at a universal value @xmath135 .",
    "ising model simulations @xcite give the estimate @xmath136 .",
    "we have measured @xmath133 for several value of the chemical potential @xmath137 , thus enabling an estimate of the locus of the @xmath6-line . for each chosen value of @xmath134 , an initial rough estimate of the critical temperature",
    "was obtained from a number of short simulations , in which the form of @xmath131 was observed visually .",
    "longer runs at this temperature were then carried out for each system size in order to facilitate a more precise determination of @xmath138 .",
    "a representative plot of @xmath139 as a function of @xmath140 and @xmath116 is shown in figure  [ fig : ullam ] for the case @xmath141 .",
    "each of the curves shown represent the histogram extrapolation of data obtained from a single simulation at the temperature @xmath142 .",
    "evidently there is no unique cumulant intersection point for the three system sizes , rather the crossing point for the @xmath143 and @xmath121 system sizes occurs at larger @xmath144 and smaller @xmath139 than for the @xmath121 and @xmath145 system sizes .",
    "it is reasonable to assume , however , that for sufficiently large @xmath116 , the cumulant intersection point _ would _",
    "converge on the universal value , @xmath136 , but that for the system sizes studied here this limit is not attained due to corrections to finite - size scaling and ( to a lesser extent ) statistical error . in view of this , we adopt as our estimate of @xmath146 , that temperature at which the cumulant intersection occurs for the two largest system sizes .",
    "the critical end point was estimated in a similar manner , by studying the cumulant ratio @xmath139 for @xmath131 as a function of @xmath140 and @xmath116 along the _ liquid _ branch of the coexistence curve . in principle",
    ", the form of @xmath131 corresponding to the liquid phase can be extracted from the joint coexistence distribution @xmath114 , since this embodies contributions from both phases .",
    "assuming there is a clear distinction between the gas and liquid phases ( ie .",
    "when @xmath120 ) , one can isolate the liquid branch component simply by disregarding all those histogram entries having @xmath147 .",
    "however , it turns out to be difficult to obtain sufficient statistics for @xmath131 in this way .",
    "this is because the preweighted simulation uniformly samples _ all _ densities between the gas and liquid phases .",
    "when the gas and liquid densities are well separated , the simulation spends only a relatively small fraction of the time sampling liquid - like configurations and accordingly the statistical quality of the histogram for @xmath131 is low . to circumvent this problem",
    ", it is expedient to perform a simulation that samples _ only _ the liquid phase , while neverthless remaining at coexistence .",
    "this is achievable by setting @xmath148 and @xmath134 to their coexistence values and performing a simulation _ without _ preweighting the density distribution .",
    "if a starting configuration having a liquid - like density is chosen , the simulation will then remain in the liquid phase by virtue of the large free energy barrier separating it from the gas phase .",
    "the results of implementing this procedure are shown in figure  [ fig : ulend ] , in which @xmath139 is plotted as a function of temperature along the liquid branch of the coexistence curve in the neighbourhood of the critical end point .",
    "the curves exhibit an intersection at @xmath149 , with a cumulant value @xmath150 for the two largest system sizes and @xmath151 for the smallest two system sizes .",
    "the associated estimate of the critical end point chemical potential and density are @xmath152 .",
    "in the interests of completeness we have also obtained the location of the liquid - gas critical point .",
    "this was achieved via a fss study of the density - like ordering operator .",
    "details of the approach used have been extensively described elsewhere @xcite and so will not be repeated here .",
    "we merely quote the results : @xmath153 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : cxcurve ] we present the estimated phase diagram of our system . plotted",
    "are the coexistence densities for the liquid and gas branches , the position of the liquid - gas critical point , the locus of the @xmath6-line and the position of the critical end point .",
    "one observes that close to the liquid - gas critical point , strong finite - size effects occur in the peak densities of @xmath118 .",
    "these have also been observed and discussed in the context of a previous study of the pure lj fluid @xcite .",
    "more striking , however , is the appearance of a pronounced ` kink ' in the liquid branch density close to the critical end point .",
    "this is a consequence of the singular behaviour on the critical line .",
    "as one would expect , the gas branch displays no such kink due to the analyticity of @xmath154 at @xmath126 .    to probe more closely the behaviour of the coexistence density , we plot in figure  [ fig : diam](a ) the diameter derivative @xmath155 , for the three system sizes studied .",
    "the data exhibit a clear peak close to @xmath126 , that narrows and grows with increasing system size .",
    "very similar behaviour is also observed in the curvature of the spectator phase boundary @xmath156 , see figure  [ fig : diam](b ) .",
    "these peaks constitute , we believe , the finite - size - rounded forms of the divergences eqs .",
    "[ eq : ddiv ] and [ eq : cdiv ] . on the basis of finite - size scaling theory @xcite ,",
    "the peaks are expected to grow in height like @xmath157 , with @xmath158 the correlation length exponent .",
    "unfortunately , it is not generally feasible to extract estimates of @xmath159 in this way ( even for simulations of lattice ising models ) , because to do so requires the ability to measure the analytic background , for which the present system sizes are much too small .",
    "nevertheless , the correspondence of the peak position with the independently estimated value of @xmath160 , as well as the narrowing and growth of the peak with increasing @xmath116 constitutes strong evidence supporting the existence of the predicted singularities .",
    "in summary , we have employed grand canonical monte - carlo simulations in conjunction with multicanonical preweighting and histogram reweighting to study the first order phase boundary near the critical end point of a continuum binary fluid model .",
    "the results provide clear evidence for the existence of singularities in the phase boundary chemical potential and the coexistence curve diameter .",
    "they thus constitute strong corroboration of the scaling arguments on whose basis the singularities are predicted .",
    "although no experimental observations of singularities at critical end points have yet been reported , we believe that given an appropriately chosen system their presence should be relatively easy to detect . in this respect ,",
    "a binary fluid model might be a good candidate system for study , since generally speaking rather precise liquid - gas coexistence curve data can be obtained . in this case",
    "the rle of the chemical potential in equation  [ eq : csing ] is replaced by the pressure , but otherwise the form of the singularity remains unaltered .",
    "of course in a real system , the lack of finite - size rounding should render the singularities more conspicuous than in a simulation .",
    "moreover , since real binary fluids do not generally possess a special symmetry between the two fluid components , the chemical potential and temperature feature in the scaling field @xmath161 , changing the @xmath162 diameter singularity into a much stronger @xmath163 singularity ( cf . section  [ sec : theory ] ) . in future work",
