    "the study of surface critical behavior in equilibrium statistical mechanics has established the importance of boundaries in critical systems and their impact on scaling and universality @xcite .",
    "quantities measured close to the surface can scale differently than in the bulk and can possess distinct critical surface exponents . depending on the boundary conditions , various surface universality classes are possible each with different values for the surface exponents . in this paper",
    "we will be interested in the surface critical behavior of certain _ dynamic _ systems , which possess a non - equilibrium phase transition from an active into an absorbing state from which the system can not escape .",
    "the most prominent example of a system with an absorbing state is _ directed percolation _ ( dp ) .",
    "it describes the directed growth of a cluster governed by a growth probability @xmath7 of its fundamental constituents . for",
    "probabilities below a critical value , @xmath8 , the cluster will die after a finite time , which means that the system gets trapped in the vacuum  the unique empty state . on the other hand , for high enough growth probabilities",
    "@xmath9 , there is a finite probability that the cluster will always remain active .",
    "exactly at @xmath10 , there is a critical phase transition from the active into the absorbing state @xcite .",
    "a whole range of other systems possessing a phase transition from a non - trivial active phase into a unique absorbing state fall into this universality class .",
    "some examples include epidemics , chemical reactions , catalysis , and the contact process ( see @xcite and references therein ) .    during the last few years , however , studies have also been carried out for systems with absorbing states which do not belong to the dp class .",
    "for instance , the model of _ branching - annihilating random walks _ with an even number of offspring ( barw ) exhibits quite different behavior @xcite and defines a separate universality class .",
    "other models in this class ( at least in @xmath6 ) include certain probabilistic cellular automata @xcite , monomer - dimer models @xcite , non - equilibrium kinetic ising models @xcite , and generalized dp with two absorbing states ( dp2 ) @xcite .",
    "these models escape from the dp universality class by possessing an extra conservation law or symmetry : for the barw model , a `` parity '' conservation of the total number of particles modulo @xmath11 ; for the other models , an underlying symmetry between their absorbing states .",
    "in the present paper we study the impact of surfaces on the critical behavior of the dp and barw models .",
    "previous work has concentrated on surface effects in dp using field theoretic methods @xcite , monte - carlo simulations in @xmath4 @xcite , the density matrix renormalization group in @xmath6 @xcite , and series expansions in @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "relations between surface dp and local persistence probabilities have been explored in @xcite .",
    "work has also been performed on active , but slanted , walls in dp , which give rise to a `` curtain '' of activity whose width is given by an angle - dependent correction to bulk dp @xcite .",
    "critical surface effects for a model in the barw universality class were first studied in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will build on this earlier work by presenting a unified picture of surface critical behavior of both barw and dp .",
    "after summarizing the main details of dp and barw in the bulk , we present a comprehensive analysis of the surface critical behavior of both models using mean field theory .",
    "this involves the usual classification into ordinary , special , surface , and extraordinary transitions .",
    "however , below their respective upper critical dimensions , fluctuation effects become important in both models , and this leads to the breakdown of mean field theory . in order to understand this fluctuation regime",
    "we employ a variety of theoretical techniques .",
    "first , we construct a phenomenological scaling theory which is able to describe the various surface universality classes . this scaling theory for barw",
    "can then , to some extent , be justified using field theoretic techniques ( a field theory for surface dp has already been presented in @xcite ) .",
    "however , the barw field theory suffers from technical problems associated with the presence of a second critical dimension , which means that the interesting @xmath6 regime can not be accessed satisfactorily .",
    "nevertheless some results can be derived field theoretically which we put together to draw up a @xmath12 dimensional surface phase diagram .",
    "this phase diagram displays many differences from its mean field analog .",
    "in addition , using exact techniques involving a mapping to a quantum spin hamiltonian , we have been able to establish an exact duality transformation for a lattice barw model in @xmath6 .",
    "we find that this links together two of the boundary phase transitions in @xmath6 in a non - trivial way ( as was suggested in @xcite ) .",
    "we have also performed extensive monte - carlo simulations for barw and dp2 which support many of our theoretical conclusions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ barwbulk ] we briefly introduce the bulk dp and barw models .",
    "then in section  [ dpsurface ] we consider the surface behavior of dp , where we present an extensive mean field analysis .",
    "we also summarize details of the fluctuation regime for @xmath13 . in sections  [ mfbarw ] and [ d=1 ] ,",
    "we give the phase diagram for surface barw in mean field theory and in @xmath6 respectively .",
    "these results can be contained within a scaling theory presented in section  [ corrbarw ] .",
    "we then discuss in section  [ fieldth ] how this analysis can be partially justified using field theoretic methods . in section  [ exres ] ,",
    "we give some exact results for @xmath6 .",
    "our theoretical analysis is then backed up using computer simulations of the lattice models introduced in section  [ dpnbarw ] .",
    "details of these simulations are presented in section  [ numres ] . finally in section  [ conc ]",
    "we round off with some conclusions .",
    "we begin by briefly reviewing the definitions of the dp and barw models .",
    "the update rules for bond dp in @xmath14 dimensions on a tilted square lattice are easily defined : for each site at time @xmath15 , form bonds with probability @xmath7 to the neighboring sites at time @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "an example of a cluster grown from a single seed according to these rules is shown in figure  [ dpfig]a .    for growth probabilities below a certain threshold such a process will eventually die out , whereas for higher values there is a finite probability of survival , which means that the system is in the active state @xcite . as is well known @xcite",
    ", various reaction - diffusion models also fall into the dp universality class .",
    "the simplest of these is defined by the following reaction scheme for a single species of diffusing particles : @xmath17 where , in the corresponding lattice model , we allow for multiple ( bosonic ) occupancy of any given site .",
    "= 1.5 in    the second system which we will analyze in detail is the barw model @xcite .",
    "this is defined again by a ( bosonic ) particle model , with the following reaction processes @xmath18 for @xmath19 odd , the above model is known to belong to the dp universality class , however for @xmath19 even we have a new universality class . unless otherwise specified when we refer to the barw model we will be referring to the even @xmath19 case .",
    "the growth of both barw and dp clusters in the bulk close to criticality can be summarized by a set of independent exponents .",
    "a natural choice is to consider @xmath20 and @xmath21 which describe the divergence of the correlation lengths in space , @xmath22 , and time @xmath23 . here",
    "the parameter @xmath24 describes the deviation from the critical point ( in mean field theory @xmath25 for dp , but @xmath26 for barw ) .",
    "we also need the order parameter exponent @xmath27 , which can be defined in two _ a priori _ different ways : it is either governed by the percolation probability ( the probability that a cluster grown from a finite seed never dies ) , @xmath28 or by the coarse - grained density of active sites in the steady state , @xmath29 when @xmath30 the system is said to be in an _ active _ state , whereas for @xmath31 the system is _ critical _ ( with an algebraically decaying density ) , and for @xmath32 ( if applicable ) the system is _ inactive _ ( with an exponentially decaying density ) @xcite . for the case of dp",
    ", it is known that @xmath27 is unique : @xmath33 in any dimension , both above and below the upper critical dimension @xmath1 .",
    "this follows from field theoretic considerations @xcite and has been verified by extensive numerical work .",
    "the relation also holds for barw in @xmath12 dimensions , a result first suggested by numerics and now backed up by an exact duality mapping @xcite .",
    "however , this exponent equality is certainly not always true : if we consider the barw mean - field regime valid for spatial dimensions @xmath34 , then the system is in a critical inactive state only for a zero branching rate , where the density decays away as a power law .",
    "however , any non - zero branching rate results in an active state , with a non - zero steady state density ( see figure  [ pbulk]a ) @xcite .",
    "this density ( [ n(delta ) ] ) approaches zero continuously ( as the branching rate is reduced towards zero ) with the mean - field exponent @xmath35 .",
    "nevertheless , for @xmath36 , the survival probability ( [ p_bulk ] ) of a particle cluster will be finite for _ any _ value of the branching rate , implying that @xmath37 in mean - field theory .",
    "this result follows from the non - recurrence of random walks in @xmath36 .",
    "field theoretically , dp is believed to be satisfactorily understood  the appropriate field theory ( sometimes called reggeon field theory ) @xcite is well under control and the exponents have been computed to two loop order in an @xmath38 expansion @xcite . however , for the case of barw , a description of the @xmath12 dimensional case poses considerable difficulties for the field theory @xcite . these stem from the presence of two critical dimensions : @xmath2 ( above which mean - field theory applies ) and @xmath39 .",
    "for @xmath40 the behavior of figure  [ pbulk]a holds , i.e. an active state results for _ any _ non - zero value of the branching @xmath41 , whereas for @xmath42 the system is only active for @xmath43 , as shown in figure  [ pbulk]b @xcite .",
    "this means that the physical spatial dimension @xmath6 can not be accessed using epsilon expansions down from the upper critical dimension @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , for the @xmath44 region , the system is _ not _ inactive ( in the sense of an exponentially decaying density ) .",
    "instead this entire phase is controlled by the annihilation fixed point of the @xmath45 process , where the density decays away as a power law .",
    "hence this phase should rather be considered as still being critical .    despite the problems associated with barw for @xmath42",
    ", we can still put forward a general scaling theory for dp and barw , valid both above and below their critical dimensions .",
    "however , we must retain a possible distinction between @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "for example , the average lifetime @xmath48 of finite clusters can be derived from the scaling form for the survival probability @xmath49 we then find @xmath50 , where @xmath51 .",
    "the appropriate scaling form for the density @xmath52 , given that the cluster was started at @xmath53 , is @xmath54 notice that rotational symmetry about the seeding point @xmath55 implies that the spatial coordinates enter the scaling function only as @xmath56 , the distance from the seeding point .",
    "using the expression ( [ densbulk ] ) we see that the average mass of finite clusters , @xmath57 , is related to the other exponents via the following hyperscaling relation : @xmath58 note that ( [ gen_bulk_hyperscaling ] ) is consistent with the distinct upper critical dimensions for barw and dp . using the above mean - field values for barw and @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61",
    ", we verify @xmath62 .",
    "in contrast , for dp one has the mean - field exponents @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "we now briefly review the surface critical behavior of dp and indicate how the above relations and exponents are modified in a semi - infinite geometry , where we place a wall at @xmath65 [ @xmath66 , with the @xmath67 and @xmath68 directions being relative to the wall ] .",
    "an example of such a cluster grown close to a wall is shown in figure  [ dpfig]b .    a schematic phase diagram for surface dp is shown in figure  [ dpps ] ( see @xcite ) , where @xmath69 is the deviation of the surface from criticality . in figure",
    "[ dpps ] , the labeling conforms to the standard nomenclature of surface critical phenomena : o stands for the ordinary transition ( bulk critical , surface inactive ) ; sp is for the special transition ( bulk and surface both critical ) ; s is for the surface transition ( surface critical , bulk inactive ) ; and finally e stands for the extraordinary transition ( surface active , bulk critical ) .",
    "the bulk exponents are , of course , unchanged by the presence of a surface and , furthermore , one can show that the correlation length exponents on the surface are also the same as in the bulk .",
    "hence , except at the special transition , one finds just _ one _ extra exponent : the surface density exponent @xmath70 .",
    "this is defined from the steady - state density at the wall .",
    "for example , at the ordinary transition , we have @xmath71 on the other hand , at the multicritical special transition , one finds _ two _ independent surface exponents  a new surface density exponent , @xmath72 , and a crossover exponent @xmath73 . in principle",
    "one could also allow for a second type of surface @xmath5 exponent , one defined from a survival probability for clusters started on the wall .",
    "for example , at the ordinary transition , we would have @xmath74 however , the surface exponents here show a similar pattern to their bulk counterparts and fulfill @xmath75 , as can be shown by a field - theoretic derivation of an appropriate correlation function @xcite",
    ". this kind of equality should also hold for the @xmath5 exponents at the special and surface transitions .",
    "numerically , the exponents at the ordinary transition have been measured very accurately using series expansions ( for @xmath6 ) @xcite , and monte - carlo simulations ( for @xmath4 ) @xcite .",
    "however , there has been no numerical work to date on any of the other possible transitions on the boundary .",
    "although a considerable amount of work has already been performed on surface dp @xcite , a comprehensive mean field analysis has been lacking .",
    "the purpose of this section is to provide such an analysis , and in the process we will derive several new results .",
    "the equation describing mean field dp with a surface is @xmath76 with the boundary condition @xmath77 here the variable @xmath78 is the difference between the rates for the @xmath79 and @xmath80 processes .",
    "similarly we have the surface variable @xmath69 , and the bulk quadratic term is due to the reaction @xmath81 . note that a surface @xmath81 reaction does not have to be included , as it is an irrelevant process in the renormalization group ( rg ) sense @xcite . from the above equation ( [ dpmfteq ] ) , the bulk mean field exponents can easily be computed : @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 . furthermore ,",
    "with the inclusion of a boundary , we see that the correlation length exponents are unchanged at the wall but the surface @xmath5 exponents are altered .",
    "if we are interested in the mean field steady state , then we can replace ( [ dpmfteq ] ) with @xmath85 where @xmath86 .",
    "the appropriate boundary condition  ( [ eq : bcgeneral ] ) is given by @xmath87 where @xmath88 , and @xmath89 .",
    "multiplying ( [ dpmftred ] ) by @xmath90 and integrating , we have @xmath91 where @xmath92 is a constant of integration . using the bulk results @xmath93 , and @xmath94 for @xmath30 , or @xmath95 for @xmath32 , we have @xmath96^{1/2}\\left(n_s- { |\\delta|\\over\\lambda}\\right)\\left({2\\over 3}n_s+{|\\delta|\\over 3\\lambda}\\right)^{1/2 } & [ \\delta<0 ] \\hspace{-.1 in } \\\\",

    "@xmath97 ordinary transition .",
    "consider the case where @xmath98 and @xmath99 . in that case",
    "we expect @xmath100 , and thus eq .  ( [ int2a ] ) yields @xmath101 , giving @xmath102 .",
    "this exponent can also be derived on physical grounds as follows ( see also @xcite ) . at the ordinary transition the density falls to zero not exactly at the wall but",
    "would rather reach zero a distance @xmath103 on the far side of the surface ( if the density were appropriately continued ) .",
    "hence , the density on the boundary can be computed from @xmath104 .",
    "since @xmath103 is a microscopic distance which remains finite even at the bulk critical point , one can compute the scaling of the surface density simply from @xmath89 .",
    "thus , from dimensional analysis , we see that @xmath105 .    @xmath97 special transition . in this case",
    "if @xmath106 we see from ( [ int2a ] ) that @xmath107 scales in the same way as the bulk density @xmath108 , i.e. @xmath109 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a simple rewriting of ( [ int2a ] ) and ( [ int2b ] ) reveals the scaling @xmath110 , fixing the crossover exponent as @xmath111 .    @xmath97 surface transition . for this case @xmath112 and @xmath32 , and hence from eq .",
    "( [ int2b ] ) we find @xmath113 $ ] for @xmath114 , and @xmath115 for @xmath116 .",
    "hence the line in parameter space where the mean field surface transition occurs is given by @xmath117 , and we then have @xmath118 .",
    "note that this is the same value as in the bulk , a standard feature of the surface transition which is believed always to be in the same universality class as a @xmath119 dimensional bulk transition .",
    "as we are dealing with mean field theory this will of course yield the same exponent for the surface transition as in the bulk .",
    "@xmath97 extraordinary transition . in this case",
    "the surface density is of course non - zero both above and below the transition . however ,",
    "if we expand @xmath107 in powers of @xmath24 for @xmath112 and @xmath120 or @xmath121 , we see that these two expansions differ at third order @xcite , i.e. @xmath107 has a discontinuity in its third derivative at @xmath31 .",
    "hence we identify @xmath122 . to the best of our knowledge , this transition does not seem to have been previously discussed in the literature .",
    "however , as is the case in equilibrium critical phenomena , we expect the extraordinary transition to be more general than the scenario described above .",
    "in fact , the extraordinary transition is associated with the onset of order in the bulk regardless of how the surface is ordered .",
    "in particular , for arbitrary values of @xmath69 , the surface can be ordered by applying the equivalent of a surface external magnetic field . for the barw process",
    "this is simply the surface spontaneous particle creation reaction @xmath123 . extending our previous mean field analysis to cover this case (",
    "sometimes called the normal transition ) , we recover precisely the same results as obtained above , with @xmath124 . hence the important point for the extraordinary transition ( as described in @xcite ) is that the surface must be active at @xmath31  the means by which this is achieved is unimportant .",
    "next , we consider the case where the bulk is _ exactly _ critical , i.e. @xmath24 is exactly zero , and therefore the correlation lengths @xmath125 and @xmath126 diverge .",
    "in that the case the density in the bulk decays away as @xmath127 .",
    "hence , for the surface , we need now to include time dependence in our analysis , and therefore ( [ dpmftred ] ) is replaced by @xmath128 where @xmath129 and the boundary condition remains as given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bc ] ) . multiplying both sides of ( [ dpmftredcrit ] ) by @xmath90 and integrating",
    ", we obtain @xmath130 where we have have used the conditions @xmath93 ( in the bulk ) and the boundary condition  ( [ eq : bc ] ) .",
    "@xmath97 exactly at the extraordinary transition . here",
    ", the density close to the wall will be in an active steady state , and hence nearby @xmath131 will be close to zero",
    ". however , well away from the surface we expect to recover bulk behavior where @xmath132 and @xmath133 . hence , to leading order the integral on the lhs of eq .",
    "( [ intcrit ] ) will be zero .",
    "therefore , from ( [ intcrit ] ) , we find a steady state on the surface with @xmath134 .",
    "furthermore , we expect that this active region will extend into the bulk , with the density decaying away asymptotically as @xmath135 .",
    "however , assuming the system is started with initial conditions at @xmath136 of constant density everywhere , then after a time @xmath15 this region will only extend into the bulk as far as @xmath137 , where we will find a crossover to the bulk @xmath138 density decay .",
    "@xmath97 exactly at the special transition . here , where @xmath106 , we see that the mean field equation ( [ intcrit ] ) is solved by @xmath139 .",
    "hence the surface density scales in the same way as in the bulk ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath97 exactly at the ordinary transition .",
    "once again if we start with initial conditions of uniform density at @xmath136 , then at later times a depletion zone will be formed close to the surface .",
    "this zone will again extend a distance of order @xmath140 into the bulk .",
    "the surface scaling can now most simply be derived via dimensional analysis of the surface operator @xmath141 , yielding @xmath142 .",
    "we expect that the phase diagram shown in figure  [ dpps ] is generally valid for surface dp close to the upper critical dimension @xmath1 .",
    "however , in @xmath12 dimensions , where the surface is just a zero dimensional point , the phase diagram may look rather different . for example , for an inactive bulk",
    ", net particle production is only possible at one point .",
    "furthermore , since particles will be constantly lost into the bulk , where they will decay away exponentially quickly , it will probably not be possible to form an active surface state ( at least for finite particle production rates ) .",
    "if this is the case only the ordinary transition will be accessible in @xmath6 .",
    "furthermore , for arbitrary dimension , we note that a system which is simply cut off at @xmath143 can also only undergo an ordinary transition .",
    "this is a result of there being the same microscopic reaction rates on the surface as in the bulk . in low dimensions it becomes more and more difficult to induce an active state ( since the fluctuations become larger ) , and hence if the bulk is adjusted to be at criticality , it follows that the surface ( considered independently ) would be inactive .",
    "therefore , for the case of dp , one will only be able to find the ordinary transition ( as was certainly the case in the simulations of @xcite ) .",
    "the scaling forms for the survival probability ( at the ordinary transition ) and correlation functions ( at the special and ordinary transitions ) have been discussed in @xcite . for example , at the ordinary transition , the survival probability for a cluster started on the wall at @xmath136 has the scaling form @xcite @xmath144 hence the average lifetime of finite clusters at the ordinary transition , @xmath145 , satisfies @xmath146 , a straightforward generalization of the bulk result .",
    "previous series expansions in @xmath12 dimensions have indicated a value for @xmath147 equal to unity @xcite , although very recent ( and even more accurate ) series results @xcite have cast some doubt on this conclusion .",
    "no theoretical explanation for why @xmath147 should be equal to unity has emerged .",
    "the bulk density @xmath52 for a cluster initiated on the wall at @xmath136 is given by @xcite @xmath148 .",

    "the first of the expressions in ( [ jancorr ] ) refers to the ordinary transition and the second to the special transition .",
    "crudely speaking , the @xmath24-prefactor in ( [ jancorr ] ) comes from ( [ p1(delta ) ] ) for the probability that an infinite cluster can be grown from the seed , and from ( [ n(delta ) ] ) for the conditional probability that the point ( @xmath153 , @xmath15 ) belongs to this cluster . at the ordinary transition , for example , it is then straightforward to derive hyperscaling relations for the mass of finite clusters which are seeded on the wall",
    ". this mass scales as @xmath154 , and as shown in @xcite one finds @xmath155 for a more detailed discussion of the dp ordinary transition , including other types of hyperscaling , we refer to ref .",
    "we now turn our attention to the main object of this paper , an understanding of the surface critical properties of barw .",
    "we will begin by discussing the barw surface phase diagram in various dimensions .",
    "the basic idea is that on the surface we may include not only the usual branching and annihilation reactions but potentially also a parity symmetry breaking @xmath79 reaction . depending on whether or not the @xmath79 reaction is actually present",
    ", we may then expect different surface universality classes according to whether the symmetry of the bulk is broken or respected at the surface .",
    "a similar situation in an equilibrium system has recently been analyzed in ref .",
    "we will find that the competition between the parity breaking @xmath79 reaction and the barw processes gives rise to some interesting phase diagrams .",
    "the surface phase diagram for the mean field theory of barw ( valid for @xmath34 ) is shown in figure  [ psurf ] .",
    "here @xmath41 , @xmath156 are the rates for the branching processes @xmath157 in the bulk and at the surface , respectively , and @xmath158 is the rate for the surface spontaneous annihilation reaction @xmath79 . otherwise , the labeling is the same as that for the dp phase diagram ( see figure  [ dpps ] ) .",
    "the first feature to note is that the bulk is either active ( @xmath159 ) or critical ( @xmath160 ) , but never inactive .",
    "hence , unlike dp , there is no possibility of finding a surface transition , where the surface is critical with the bulk inactive . for the case",
    "where @xmath161 , we expect that for any finite value of the surface branching , the surface will become active .",
    "this corresponds to the extraordinary transition with an active surface and critical bulk .",
    "on the other hand for @xmath162 and @xmath163 , the density at an ( isolated ) surface would decay away exponentially quickly due to the @xmath79 reaction .",
    "hence the bulk is critical , with the surface inactive ; i.e. the ordinary transition .",
    "consequently with @xmath160 , but both @xmath158 and @xmath156 non - zero , there should be a line of special transitions dividing the extraordinary and ordinary regions .",
    "this explains the general features of the phase diagram in figure  [ psurf ] .    at a more quantitative level ,",
    "the mean field equation for barw is very similar to that for dp : @xmath164 with the boundary condition @xmath165 however the values of the @xmath24 , @xmath69 parameters are now different : @xmath26 and @xmath166 .",
    "the fact that @xmath24 is always non - positive excludes any possibility of a surface transition .",
    "otherwise we expect the same mean field exponents as in dp for the special and ordinary transitions @xcite ( except for the @xmath167 exponents , see below ) .",
    "however , the non - positivity of @xmath24 also leads to an ambiguity associated with the definition of @xmath168 : we would have to know the behavior of the surface density on both sides of the extraordinary transition if we wanted to isolate the discontinuity and extract the exponent .",
    "we can also consider the mean field behavior of the @xmath167 exponents , which is very different from the corresponding behavior in dp .",
    "consider placing two particles next to the surface at @xmath136 .",
    "from the recurrence properties of random walks we see that , regardless of the reaction rates on the surface or in the bulk , there is a finite chance that the two particles will never meet again .",
    "hence the survival probability is _ non - zero _ and thus @xmath169 in mean field theory for the ordinary and special transitions .",
    "next , we turn our attention to the phase diagram for @xmath12 dimensions shown in figure  [ psurf1d ] .",
    "although we will make a few remarks below , we will postpone a proper justification until we have discussed the appropriate field theory in section  [ fieldth ] .",
    "the phase diagram looks quite different from its mean field analog due in part to the shift of the bulk critical point away from zero branching rate , but also due to the absence of any extraordinary transition ( for finite reaction rates ) .",
    "physically , this is due to the fact that excess particle production ( with a finite reaction rate ) at a zero dimensional surface is simply not efficient enough to generate an active state , due to leakage into the critical bulk ( which for @xmath170 is controlled by the fixed point of the @xmath45 reaction @xcite ) .",

    "unfortunately the use of field theoretic techniques here will be plagued by precisely the same problems as afflicted the bulk calculation , namely the appearance of a second critical dimension @xmath257 .",
    "hence one would be forced into using uncontrolled techniques ( such as the truncated loop expansion in fixed dimension ) whose values for the bulk exponents are known to be in rather poor agreement with numerics @xcite .",
    "furthermore , field and diffusion constant renormalizations , which will be of considerable importance in @xmath6 , are not adequately taken into account in the truncated loop theory .",
    "in fact these renormalizations only appear at two loop order .",
    "unfortunately the authors of @xcite were unable to show that a meaningful truncated loop theory exists at all at the level of two loops .",
    "in addition , further technical difficulties exist for @xmath42 involving dangerous irrelevant variables , which have so far prevented a derivation of scaling relations _ at _ criticality even in the bulk . in the light of these problems we have not attempted to extend the truncated loop analysis to surface barw .",
    "the @xmath12 dimensional regime which should more amenable to field theoretic analysis is when both the bulk and surface branching processes are unimportant , and hence we should be able to use results derived solely from the @xmath45 reaction .",

    "@xcite , which predicts a @xmath258 decay both in the bulk and at the wall , with a density excess at the wall .",
    "we note that the critical sp * state in @xmath6 can be characterized in two ways : as a decaying density , or as a survival probability . if we place two particles close together in the bulk at @xmath136 , then , from simple random walk theory , the probability these particles are still alive at time @xmath15 scales as @xmath258 . hence , in the bulk , these two ways of characterizing this phase scale in the same way .",

    "the relevant surface operator is again just @xmath259 .",
    "therefore , since distance still scales as @xmath260\\sim t^{1/2}$ ] , we can obtain the required surface scaling from simple dimensional analysis .",
    "since the bulk @xmath6 density decays as @xmath258 , we see that the surface density must decay as @xmath138 .",
    "however , we must emphasize again at this point that the methods and results mentioned here are only applicable where both the surface and bulk branching processes are _",
    "unimportant_. unfortunately , therefore , the more interesting sp and o transitions in @xmath12 dimensions remain out of reach .",

    ", we postulate that the equality between the two surface exponents is valid everywhere close to the transition line , and not just where @xmath283 .",
    "it is now straightforward to derive the relation @xmath307 ( again at the line @xmath283 ) .",
    "one simply starts off with the quantum hamiltonian @xmath290 and then follows the same steps as above .",
    "@xmath290 can then be mapped back onto the starting hamiltonian @xmath275 , meaning that the transformation is actually a duality transformation .",
    "a relation like that in ( [ equiv ] ) can then be derived , giving @xmath307 .    in summary , at the particular line in parameter space @xmath283 ,",
    "we have derived some exponent equalities which are in full agreement with the simulations to be presented in the next section . in particular",
    ", we see that we have mapped barw at the special transition onto barw at the ordinary transition in @xmath12 dimensions ( and vice - versa ) , a rather non - trivial procedure .",
    "this has allowed us to derive some results about the @xmath5 exponents ( something which seems to be beyond the ability of the field theoretic methods at present ) .",
    "unfortunately , as is always the case with exact calculations , the result is only derived for one line in parameter space and we have to rely on universality in order to claim that it is valid elsewhere close to the transition line .",
    "we will now briefly present the specific models and boundary conditions used in our numerical simulations .",
    "we begin with dp , include its generalization to dp2 , and then comment on how we implement barw . in all cases",
    "we include the specific boundary conditions and identify them according to the classification in sections  [ dpsurface ] and  [ barwsurface ] .    for @xmath6 , bond dp as well as site dp ( for which the sites percolate instead of the bonds ) ,",
    "are contained in the domany - kinzel model @xcite .",
    "each site can either be active or inactive and the probability for site @xmath265 to be updated to state @xmath308 at time @xmath16 is given by @xmath309 .",
    "see figure  [ dplattice ] for a typical lattice configuration and figure  [ dprules ] for the update rules .",
    "the dp2 model has two symmetric absorbing states in which the system can be trapped .",
    "it is a special case of a generalized domany - kinzel model ( dp@xmath108 ) introduced by hinrichsen @xcite , where each site can be either active or in one of @xmath108 inactive states . for @xmath310 the update rules",
    "are identical to those of the domany - kinzel model in figure  [ dprules ] , but for @xmath311 , the distinction between regions of different inactive states is preserved by demanding that they are separated by active ones .",
    "an example of a dp2 cluster is shown in figure  [ dp2fig]b , where we have also shown an ordinary dp cluster in figure  [ dp2fig]a for comparison . in @xmath12 dimensions",
    ", dp2 belongs to the barw universality class , and the update probabilities are given in figure  [ dp2rules ] .",
    "= 1.5 in    the easiest way of introducing a boundary into dp and dp2 is simply to cut off the lattice .",
    "this is equivalent to introducing boundary sites which are forced to be in one of the inactive states .",
    "we will refer to this case as the inactive boundary condition ( ibc ) and we choose inactivity of type @xmath273 to the left of the boundary , see figure  [ dp2_ibc ] .",
    "apart from imposing the state of these sites within the wall , the sites at the wall and those in the bulk are updated by the rules in figures  [ dprules ] and  [ dp2rules ] .",
    "next we consider the reflecting boundary condition ( rbc ) where the wall acts like a mirror so that the sites within the wall are always a mirror image of those next to the wall , see figure  [ dp2_rbc ] . for dp2",
    ", one can see that there is a qualitative difference between the ibc and the rbc . for the latter , regions of type-@xmath11 inactivity",
    "can get trapped at the wall and the only way for these regions to disappear is to wait for the cluster to return , whereas for the ibc such regions are never trapped .",
    "we now consider the active boundary condition ( abc ) where the sites within the wall are forced to be active , see figure  [ dp2_abc ] . in this case",
    "the cluster will never die completely as the wall will always be active and can always induce new clusters .",
    "nevertheless , by defining the survival time of a cluster as the point in time when the system has no activity apart from within the wall itself , we can define the same exponents for the abc as for the other boundary conditions .",
    "we have , however , not studied this boundary condition in any detail but merely mention it here for completeness",
    ".    we can now discuss the relation between the above boundary conditions and our previous classification of the universality classes at the boundary for barw in @xmath12 dimensions .",
    "the key feature is whether the symmetry between the two absorbing states in the bulk is preserved at the surface . in terms of the dp2 model , the ibc model respects this symmetry and hence it belongs to the special ( sp ) universality class , whereas the rbc model does not respect this symmetry , and hence belongs to the ordinary ( o ) universality class",
    "furthermore , the abc model clearly belongs to the extraordinary ( e ) universality class .",
    "hence we see that by using the ibc , rbc , abc classification all the previously discussed boundary barw transitions in @xmath12 dimensions can be accessed .    furthermore , let us note that for dp the classification of the ibc and rbc is somewhat different .",
    "in @xmath12 dimensions dp probably does not support the special transition , and since no symmetry is broken by the rbc , both the ibc and rbc will belong to the ordinary transition universality class @xcite .",
    "we have also performed simulations for a lattice barw model with ibc and rbc boundary conditions .",
    "for barw we initially placed two particles at the two sites closest to the wall .",
    "the one - dimensional barw model is then implemented with `` dynamic branching '' , which means that the branching of one particle into three particles occurs randomly to either the left or the right of the particle @xcite .",
    "the barw model is expected to be in the same universality class as dp2 and our results are in agreement with this for both bulk and surface quantities ( using the ibc and rbc ) .",
    "hence , in the following section , we will only discuss the results for dp2 since this is also the model to which we devoted most of our simulations .",
    "we have studied dp2 in detail using monte carlo simulations in @xmath12 dimensions .",
    "the wall is placed at @xmath312 and we use an initial configuration with one active site at @xmath312 , with the sites @xmath313 being in the inactive state @xmath314 .",
    "thus the absorbing state corresponds to the situation where all sites are in the inactive state @xmath314 .",
    "the system is evolved according to the dp2 rules ( see figure  [ dp2rules ] ) , and we typically average over @xmath315 independent clusters in order to reduce the error bars to a few percent . using the notation of figure  [ dp2rules ] ,",
    "we have carried out simulations for @xmath316 at the critical probability @xmath317 , where we have used the estimate @xmath318 @xcite .    in these simulations , starting from a seed on the wall , we measure the survival probability @xmath319 , the activity in the bulk @xmath320 and at the wall @xmath321 , the average spread of the cluster @xmath322 , and the probability @xmath323 to have a cluster of size ( mass ) @xmath324 , all at criticality @xcite . furthermore , by averaging over surviving clusters only ( denoted by an over  line ) , we measure the surviving bulk activity @xmath325 and the surviving wall activity @xmath326 , again starting from a seed on the wall .",
    "first we performed simulations for dp2 without a wall and obtained results for the exponents in complete agreement with those in @xcite .",
    "our results are listed in tables [ table - exp1 ] and [ table - exp2 ] .",
    "there are several estimates available for the bulk exponent @xmath47 ( @xmath327 ) @xcite . in the following",
    "we will use the estimate @xmath328 @xcite .",
    "we now list some exponent relations used to extract the exponents from our numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "all the relations given below are valid for both the ibc ( special ) and rbc ( ordinary ) dp2 transitions , and hence these labels will be suppressed from now on .",
    "the probability for a cluster grown from a seed on the wall still to be alive at time @xmath15 is given by eq .",
    "( [ barwsurvwall ] ) . at criticality ( @xmath329 ) it has the following behavior @xmath330 with the exponent @xmath331 hence , the probability of growing a cluster which lives exactly @xmath15 time steps behaves as @xmath332 .",
    "away from criticality it is straightforward to obtain the average cluster lifetime of finite clusters from ( [ barwsurvwall ] ) .",
    "one obtains @xmath333 with the exponent @xmath334    the average number of active sites at criticality , averaged over all clusters , is obtained by integrating the density ( [ ansatz_rho_wall ] ) over space , and one arrives at @xmath335 with @xmath336 where we have introduced the cluster envelope or `` roughness '' exponent @xmath337 ( @xmath338 ) , and the notation @xmath339 .",
    "note that ( [ eq : kappa_1 ] ) corresponds to the hyperscaling relation ( [ surf_hyperscaling ] ) , a fact which follows from @xmath340 , and the relation @xmath341 . by integrating the density on the wall ( [ ansatz_rho_wall_wall ] )",
    ", we obtain the average number of active sites at criticality on the wall @xmath342 with @xmath343 and where @xmath344 .",
    "note also that ( [ eq : kappa_1,1 ] ) corresponds to the hyperscaling relation ( [ surf_hyperscaling_wall_wall ] ) at criticality , since @xmath345 , and @xmath346 .",
    "alternatively , by averaging only over clusters which survive to infinity ( denoted by an over  line ) , we obtain @xmath347 where @xmath348 the activity on the wall for surviving clusters reads @xmath349 with the exponent @xmath350 simulations in @xmath12 dimensions thus directly yield @xmath351 .",
    "the average position of activity follows from ( [ ansatz_rho_wall ] ) @xmath352 where @xmath353 is the distance from the seed and the average is taken over all active points at a given time .    for further confirmation of our numerical data we also considered the cluster size distributions at criticality .",
    "in the bulk the typical cluster size @xmath324 of finite clusters scales as volume times density , i.e. @xmath354 with @xmath355 from the lifetime survival distribution ( [ eq : p_1(t ) ] ) , it is then straightforward to obtain the probability @xmath356 to have a cluster of size larger than @xmath324 , for clusters started from a seed on the wall .",
    "using the fact that the lifetime is set by the parallel correlation length , @xmath357 , we see that the typical cluster size and lifetime are connected by @xmath358 hence we obtain @xmath359 .",
    "thus , we eventually obtain the probability @xmath323 to have a cluster of exactly size @xmath324 , @xmath360 , with the result @xmath361 where @xmath362 similarly , the cluster size distribution on the wall due to a seed located at the wall can also be obtained . in this case the typical cluster size of finite clusters is @xmath363 where @xmath364 the resulting distribution reads @xmath365 with @xmath366 note also that many of the scaling expressions given above only apply exactly at bulk criticality .",
    "away from that point one must also include a scaling function .",
    "for example , eq .  ( [ eq : p_1(t ) ] )",
    "is replaced by @xmath367 , and eq .",
    "( [ eq : p_1(s ) ] ) is replaced by @xmath368 .    in tables",
    "[ table - exp1 ] and [ table - exp2 ] we list our estimates for the critical exponents for dp2 .",
    "our results are in complete accordance with our theoretical analysis : bulk exponents are unaltered whereas the wall introduces two separate surface exponents .",
    "we have also carried out bulk and surface simulations for @xmath30 and confirmed that our data can be collapsed according to an appropriate survival probability scaling function [ see ( [ barwsurvwall ] ) for the surface case ] , using our exponent estimates .",
    "this numerically confirms the validity of the relation @xmath369 for the bulk , as well as the analogous relations for the both sets of surface exponents @xcite .    by using the explicit definitions of the ibc and rbc",
    ", we can deduce some further properties of the @xmath370 and @xmath371 exponents .",
    "there will be more activity next to the wall for the ibc than for the rbc , since the latter can have regions of @xmath372 located at the wall .",
    "once created , these @xmath372 regions will survive until the activity returns to the wall .",
    "thus it follows that @xmath373 . on the other hand",
    ", the existence of these @xmath372 regions implies that the survival probability ( [ barwsurvwall ] ) for the rbc will be greater than for the ibc , leading to @xmath374 . note that both our simulations and our previous exact calculations show that @xmath375 is the same for both the rbc and ibc . using a hyperscaling relation [ like that in ( [ surf_hyperscaling_wall_wall ] ) ]",
    ", this implies that @xmath376 ( although both exponents defined in this way are negative ) .",
    "we have also studied several other boundary conditions and found that these give the same scaling behavior as either the rbc or ibc depending on whether the above - mentioned @xmath372 regions can disappear only at the wall or also in the bulk .",
    "we can obtain an interesting exponent relation for the rbc transition by assuming that the survival probability is dominated by the return to the wall of the cluster - envelope , which leads to @xcite @xmath377 in agreement with our simulation results for the rbc .",
    "qualitatively , this means that the @xmath372 regions located at the wall determine the scaling since they can only disappear when the activity returns to the wall .",
    "note that a relation of this kind clearly fails for the ibc transition .",
    "furthermore , if the cluster lifetime is defined to be the return time of the cluster - envelope ( i.e.  the return time of the rightmost active site ) to the initial point , then we expect clusters defined in this way to have a lifetime distribution exponent @xmath378 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq:1-chi ] ) .",
    "this prediction is in agreement with the simulations in @xcite , where various models in the dp and barw classes were studied with cluster lifetimes defined in the way described above .    for dp",
    "it has been customary for some time to investigate whether the critical exponents can be fitted by simple rational numbers @xcite .",
    "such a fitting has also been tried for bulk barw with the following guesses in @xmath12 dimensions : @xmath379 and @xmath380 @xcite .",
    "these estimates lead immediately to @xmath381 ( and @xmath382 , @xmath383 ) .",
    "it is intriguing to note that our numerical results for dp2 in addition suggest that @xmath384 for the ibc and @xmath385 for the rbc . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : mu_1 ] ) , it then follows that @xmath386 for the ibc and @xmath387 for the rbc .",
    "we would need one more relation in order to obtain the last independent exponent , which we can take to be @xmath21 .",
    "in fact , we observe numerically that the relation @xmath388 is valid to within one percent . from these observations",
    "the remaining dp2 exponents follow : @xmath389 , @xmath390 and @xmath391",
    ". furthermore , @xmath392 and @xmath393 for the ibc , and vice versa for the rbc .",
    "however , at present we have no understanding of these possible exact values for the @xmath12 dimensional exponents .",
    "barw is certainly not conformally invariant and consequently until some theoretical framework is proposed to explain why these exponents could be rational numbers , numerical coincidence remains a distinct possibility .",
    "in this paper we have presented a study of critical surface effects in systems with non - equilibrium phase transitions . in particular",
    "we have focused on the dp and barw universality classes , where we have put forward a unified presentation involving mean - field , scaling , field - theoretic and exact methods .",
    "furthermore , many of our theoretical conclusions have been backed up by large - scale monte - carlo simulations .    nevertheless , there are still a number of open questions",
    ". in particular our understanding of surface barw in @xmath12 dimensions is hampered by the fundamental problems of the field theory , which mean that the boundary ( and bulk ) transitions occurring at @xmath236 remain difficult to treat using rg methods .",
    "furthermore , we have concentrated on the ordinary and special transitions in @xmath12 dimensional barw  there will most likely also be interesting behavior for the extraordinary transition .",
    "finally , our most important result is the existence of two independent surface exponents : @xmath70 and @xmath167 for surface barw ( and dp2 ) .",
    "this certainly distinguishes dp from barw , since for the former case , @xmath394 . for the @xmath12 dimensional barw case on the other hand , we have used exact techniques to link the surface exponents at the ordinary and special transitions , giving @xmath305 and @xmath395 .",
