    "in the last decade , high - velocity dislocation motion in crystals has been the subject of many two - dimensional ( 2d ) studies by molecular dynamics,@xcite or via direct measurements in a plasma crystal slab.@xcite from these studies , a wealth of data has been collected , either in the form of time - velocity curves,@xcite or of terminal velocity - versus - applied stress plots.@xcite these data illustrate the wide variety of behaviors presented by dislocations subjected to dynamic loadings in the 2d problem . among some intriguing effects , the subsonic / transonic transition of an edge dislocation@xcite deserves special attention , in view of its complicated dependence on the external loading . for instance , the long - time asymptotic velocity state of the dislocation depends on the loading being applied in one , or in two steps , which no theory has yet reproduced . during the transition the dislocation core undergoes drastic size variations.@xcite",
    "such dynamic effects are expected to be important to high - strain rate deformation processes , and could notably modify the well - established interaction mechanisms between dislocations in quasistatic deformation.@xcite so far , discussion of the transonic / subsonic transition has mainly been based either on the atomistic simulations , or on steady - state models.@xcite it is natural , however , to expect that more complete understanding of the phenomenon will arise from a suitable dynamic equation of motion ( eom ) of dislocations  yet to be found .    apart from their intrinsic theoretical interest , the above issues must clearly be elucidated in the recently advocated perspective of employing non - quasistatic dislocation - dynamics methods to study fast deformation processes in metals at the mesoscopic level , accounting for elastodynamic wave propagation.@xcite traditionally , approaches to dislocation motion , mainly relevant to the low - velocity phonon - drag - controlled regime,@xcite rely on a simple overdamped mobility law and include inertia ( when needed ) by means of a newtonian - like dislocation mass factor.@xcite however , such phenomenological approaches ( including relativistic ones@xcite ) have been ruled out by phase - field calculations when acceleration is fast , and when the velocity becomes a sizable fraction of the shear wave speed.@xcite as has long been recognized,@xcite the key to dislocation inertia resides in the phenomenon of radiation reaction . at nonsupersonic velocities , inertia arises from the finite - width dislocation moving within its own wavefield emitted at every past instant , which results in retarded self - interaction and makes motion history - dependent.@xcite for high strain - rate processes , usual mobility laws are simply not adequate .    starting with eshelby,@xcite progresses",
    "have been made over the years in computing dynamic self - interactions and fields radiated into the surrounding medium by non - uniformly moving dislocations.@xcite the self - force has been extensively discussed by markenscoff and co - workers under an assumptions of rigid dislocation core.@xcite based on eshelby s seminal work ( valid at small velocities ) , the issue of radiative - damping losses has been addressed by alshits _ et al._,@xcite and a phenomenological eom aimed at velocities less than the shear wave - speed has been proposed by pillon _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite more recently , these questions were re - examined by the present author , resulting in an extended eom that , in principle , allows for arbitrary core variations with time.@xcite however , the theory still lacks an independent governing equation for the core , and must be completed by an ad - hoc approximation to be of use , which considerably restricts its domain of validity .",
    "this calls for a more firmly grounded derivation method , capable of providing the missing equation .",
    "accordingly , the present work aims at obtaining from general principles an improved eom , in the framework of isotropic elastodynamics , paying  in view of the aforementioned available data  special attention to its predictions as to the so - called transonic regime@xcite and to the subsonic / transonic transition .",
    "we restrict our attention to single rectilinear dislocations ( two - dimensional problem ) .",
    "in particular , the question of dislocation splitting into partials,@xcite which is important for instance in high strain - rate twinning processes,@xcite is left out .",
    "steady supersonic motion is not considered either , for reasons to be clarified .",
    "however , _ transient _ supersonic states will be permitted .",
    "the peierls model proves a convenient starting point to account for core - related effects , via an input from the generalized stacking - fault ( gsf ) energy ( or @xmath0-surface ) potential , which measures the energy cost of lattice mismatch at the core.@xcite in statics , the peierls - nabarro ( pn ) functional equation@xcite determines the dislocation core shape from balancing the projections on the glide plane of the ( self- ) stress generated by the dislocation , and of the pull - back stress that keeps the lattice together .",
    "the latter stress derives from the gsf energy .",
    "following eshelby s ideas,@xcite the pn equation has been generalized by the author to dynamics@xcite into what is called hereafter the _ dynamic peierls - nabarro equation _ ( dpe ) , to be reviewed in sec .",
    "[ sec : dpe ] . in short ,",
    "the dpe stems from a reduction to one dimension ( the coordinate along the glide plane ) of the two - dimensional elastodynamic problem that consists in computing in the surrounding medium the elastodynamic fields emitted by the dislocation , in the spirit of boundary - integral - equation methods,@xcite .",
    "while the latter problem can be addressed by means of phase - field type numerical methods of solution,@xcite the computation of the time - dependent fields outside the slip plane proves superfluous for the eom , for which only the stress field on the slip plane is needed.@xcite    solving numerically the dpe is an outstanding task . here",
    ", recourse is made to approximations .",
    "as the dpe deals with infinitely many degrees of freedom ( i.e. , the full core shape function),@xcite our first step is to reduce this number by employing a suitable ansatz for the master core shape , centered on the dislocation position @xmath1 at time @xmath2 and scaled by a time - dependent core width variable @xmath3 .",
    "these two quantities stand as collective variables ( cvs ) , for which simpler governing equation of motion are sought . to this purpose",
    "we appeal to the systematic collective - variable method of projection,@xcite well - known in soliton theory,@xcite which we reformulate in sec .",
    "[ sec : collvars ] in a way that suits our needs .",
    "further details are provided in appendix [ sec : evoleq ] . applying the method to the dpe",
    ", we arrive at the desired eom for the dislocation in sec .",
    "[ sec : eom ] , in the form of a retarded integro - differential functional equation for @xmath1 and @xmath3 , with history dependence in the latter variables .",
    "rather unexpectedly , the eom naturally shows up in complex - valued form , of real and imaginary parts the ( coupled ) governing equation for @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "its real part turns out to be the previously obtained incomplete eom,@xcite while the imaginary part provides the missing equation for the core width . by construction",
    ", the obtained eom will be seen to reduce in the steady - state limit to rosakis s model i,@xcite which describes high - velocity steady motion in the nonsupersonic range . as a byproduct",
    ", we retrieve the kinetic relations of the latter model in a generic form , independent of the dislocation character .",
    "the physical content of the eom is further explored in sec .",

    "we carry out in sec .",
    "[ sec : numres ] an in - depth analysis of the subsonic / transonic transition under single - step and double - step loadings , making quantitative comparisons with some atomistic results by jin _",
    "et al_.@xcite a concluding discussion closes the paper .    before proceeding , it is worthwhile to point out that in field theories other than elastodynamics , the influence of radiation reaction on the motion of charged particles is of considerable interest as well ( for a dislocation , the  charge \" is the burgers vector ) .",
    "for instance , in classical electrodynamics , the long - standing issue of finding a non - pathological equation of motion for an extended electric charge is still attracting attention . in the latter context , for lack of an appropriate force model to bind the charge distribution together , an hypothesis of rigid shape is almost always made , which leads to conceptual difficulties.@xcite by contrast , the eom for dislocations to be obtained is internally consistent within elastodynamics , and allows one to study dynamic shape variations of the defect .",

    "<S> a theoretical framework is proposed to derive a dynamic equation motion for rectilinear dislocations within isotropic continuum elastodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the theory relies on a recent dynamic extension of the peierls - nabarro equation , so as to account for core - width generalized stacking - fault energy effects . </S>",
    "<S> the degrees of freedom of the solution of the latter equation are reduced by means of the collective - variable method , well - known in soliton theory , which we reformulate in a way suitable to the problem at hand . through these means , </S>",
    "<S> two coupled governing equations for the dislocation position and core width are obtained , which are combined into one single complex - valued equation of motion , of compact form . </S>",
    "<S> the latter equation embodies the history dependence of dislocation inertia . </S>",
    "<S> it is employed to investigate the motion of an edge dislocation under uniform time - dependent loading , with focus on the subsonic / transonic transition . except in the steady - state supersonic range of velocities  which the equation does not address  our results are in good agreement with atomistic simulations on tungsten . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , we provide an explanation for the transition , showing that it is governed by a loading - dependent _ dynamic _ critical stress . </S>",
    "<S> the transition has the character of a delayed bifurcation . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , various quantitative predictions are made , that could be tested in atomistic simulations . </S>",
    "<S> overall , this work demonstrates the crucial role played by core - width variations in dynamic dislocation motion . </S>"
