    "causality formalizes the universal human experience of agents ( causes ) taking actions leading to results ( effects )  . in the western philosophical tradition",
    "aristotle postulated four kinds of causes namely the material , the formal , the efficient and the final , out of which bacon retained the material and the efficient .",
    "the material cause is in modern terms the material properties of an object , ultimately determined by which atoms it is composed of and how these are ordered in space , while the efficient cause is how the object is influenced by other objects .",
    "the third law of newton  @xcite however states that in nature there is no separation between cause and effect in the aristotelian or baconian sense ; physics fundamentally knows only interactions , and these are always mutual , a state of affairs unchanged since that time and the replacement of the classical physics by quantum physics .",
    "when the term causal is used to describe an interaction in modern high - energy physics it means only that the influence can not propagate faster than light so that object @xmath0 at time @xmath1 only depends on what happened at object @xmath2 at times @xmath3 early enough that a signal from @xmath2 can reach @xmath0 at time @xmath1 , and _ vice versa",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "the everyday and the philosophical notions of causality are in physics instead intertwined with reversibility and irreversibility ; nature s laws are time - reversal invariant on the fundamental level , but most ordinarily encountered processes are overwhelmingly likely to only flow in one direction  @xcite .",
    "we say that dropping a glass vase on the floor is the cause of it breaking because it is exceedingly unlikely that the glass pieces would jump back together and fuse into a vase .",
    "similarly , we say an enzyme causes a chemical reaction in one direction when the concentrations of the reactants are such that the opposite reaction is very unlikely .",
    "although the details of this complex process are not fully known , we can also say that smoking causes cancer because the dna in living cells is mostly that of one and the same genome for each individual  an extremely small subset of all possible dna sequences of the same length  and cancerogenes in tobacco smoke therefore almost always lead to mutations away from the healthy genotype and into one out of very many deficient genotypes . in nature cause - effect relationships are thus but",
    "abbreviations for processes in physical systems so strongly driven out of thermal equilibrium that they mostly only go one way .",
    "nevertheless , causal analysis is an important branch of statistics , describing the effects of interventions and answering questions of the `` if - so - then - what ? ''",
    "character  @xcite .",
    "interventions are then taken to be outside nature , typically ascribed to a human agent , and causality is thus distinct from statistical association studies .",
    "if person @xmath4 is holding a glass vase and person @xmath5 trips him over , then person @xmath4 is quite likely to fall and break the vase .",
    "however , we can not know this for sure without observing the event as person @xmath4 might for instance be much larger and stronger than @xmath5 . likewise",
    ", if we can deactivate enzyme @xmath6 then we can observe that a catalyzed reaction @xmath7 ceases ,",
    "while if we can over - activate @xmath6 then the catalyzed reaction goes faster .",
    "this is the paradigm for how molecular biologists identity interactions experimentally ; good research practice and common sense hold that observing such direct responses is a more reliable means to acquire knowledge than observing the variations of @xmath6 and the speed of the reaction @xmath7 in natural undisturbed conditions .",
    "for example , the catalyzed reaction may be one in a series of reactions @xmath8 , catalyzed by enzymes @xmath9 and the living cell may regulate the production of all these enzymes by the availability of the first substrate @xmath10  @xcite . in this case",
    "@xmath9 would all vary positively with the speed of the reaction @xmath7 and only a direct experiment can determine which of them actually does the job .",
    "the first purpose of this paper is to show that there is a conceptual parallelism between causal analysis in statistics and long - time response functions in physics .",
    "a main difference is that the results of an intervention in causal analysis is ( comparatively ) easy to determine , while the response function integrates dynamical information on all time scales .",
    "the second purpose is to show how the tools of message - passing / belief propagation , developed to analyse complex static interdepencies , have been generalized to describe dynamics with complex interactions , and then known as dynamic cavity . under suitable assumptions the dynamic cavity simplifies considerably the determination long - time responses , which can hence be considered an alternative starting point of a causal analysis .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : do - calculus ] we describe in simple terms causal analysis , following mainly  @xcite . in section  [ sec : correlation - response ] we give a short summary of correlation - response theory using markov chains ( synchronously updated spin systems ) as our main example , and show the parallelism between a causal analysis and correlation - response . in section  [ sec : dynamic - cavity ] we describe dynamic cavity as a generalization of message - passing / belief propagation to dynamic phenomena , and show that it can be used to turn correlation - response into an alternative to causal analysis , for some systems . in section  [ sec : discussion ]",
    "we sum up and discuss our results .",
    "statistical physicists are nowadays conversant with graphical models to describe probability distributions  @xcite .",
    "to explain causal analysis we will start with two very simple bayesian belief networks @xmath11 where by @xmath12 we mean that both the random variable @xmath2 is dependent on random variable @xmath0 in the ordinary sense of probability , and also that @xmath0 ( somehow ) causes @xmath2 .",
    "the dependency is encoded in conditional probabilities @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are values of @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",
    "the joint probabilities of the three variables are in the two cases @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the marginal probability of variable @xmath2 to take value @xmath15 while @xmath18 is the marginal probability of the pair of variables @xmath0 and @xmath2 to take values @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and so on .",
    "we assume for simplicity that @xmath19 is different from zero for all values @xmath15 of @xmath2 .",
    "both bayesian belief networks encode the same joint probability ; we can not distinguish by covariation whether @xmath0 causes @xmath2 or @xmath2 causes @xmath0 . in the language of factor graphs this joint probability can alternatively be described by a factor graph  @xcite @xmath20 with factors @xmath21 and @xmath22 the partition function @xmath23 is determined by the interactions encoded by the factors of the factor graph , and is in general difficult to compute for large models , but in the simple example considered here it is obviously equal to one .    in both cases described above the joint probability of @xmath0 and @xmath24 conditioned on @xmath2",
    "is then @xmath25 where we have introduced pearl s `` see '' notation  @xcite . to avoid confusion ,",
    "let us note again that @xmath13 in above has its ordinary probabilistic meaning of @xmath26 and is the same in both models .",

    "( b ) _ we also have @xmath33 , but for the other probability instead @xmath36 corresponding to a factor @xmath37 in ( [ eq : factor - graph - reduced ] ) .",
    "this difference is ultimately what it means to interpret the arrows in ( [ eq:2-bbns ] ) as causes : if @xmath0 is a cause and @xmath2 is an effect then @xmath0 should be unaffected by @xmath2 , and in particular unaffected by any outside intervention on @xmath2 . therefore , whether or not there is any intervention on @xmath2 , in case _ ( b ) _ the marginal probability of @xmath0 is and remains @xmath38 and the `` do '' ( [ eq : do ] ) is different from the `` see '' ( [ eq : see ] ) .",

    "both modify a probabilistic model by eliminating one or more variables , figuratively opening a hole ( or cavity ) in the factor graph .",
    "a first difference is that in the cavity method the variable and all its interactions are eliminated as if they were never there , while in a do operation the variable is set to a constant and the value of that constant matters . instead of ( [ eq : joint - probability - general ] ) we thus have , taking @xmath62 for some @xmath63",
    ", @xmath64 where @xmath65 is a new normalization constant and @xmath66 is a new function obtained from @xmath67 by setting the variable @xmath68 to the constant @xmath69 .",
    "hence we can express the `` see '' and the `` do '' as @xmath70 which again shows how and why the two concepts differ . a graphical illustration of the do operation given in fig .  [ fig : do - see ] .    .",
    "right panel : reduced bayesian belief network after intervening on variable @xmath4 setting it to value @xmath71 .",

    "ingoing links to node containing @xmath4 are eliminated together with random variable @xmath4 which does not appear in ( [ eq : joint - probability - post ] ) .",
    ", width=298 ]    a second and more important difference is that the do operation is formulated for bayesian belief networks of which ( as we have seen ) there can be many corresponding to the same joint probability distribution . under the operations @xmath72 for different @xmath4 , each bayesian belief network ( _ i.e. _ each direction of the arrows in eq .  ( [ eq:2-bbns ] ) ) hence specifies a different set of changes of the joint probability distribution encoded in a factor graph .    an important question in causal analysis",
    "is whether probabilities after an intervention , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath73 , @xmath74 standing for any subset of the endogenous variables , can be determined from observations before the intervention , _",
    "i.e. _ from the set @xmath75 ( any and all @xmath76 ) . when this is",
    "so one says that a causal effect query is _ identifiable _ because it can be decided ( the probability @xmath73 estimated ) from data obtained before an intervention . in both",
    "the simple examples above this was the case , only the @xmath73 s were not the same . more generally , a causal effect query is always identifiable from passively observed @xmath75 , provided that all variables in @xmath44 are observed and @xmath48 is known  @xcite . in less technical terms this last statement means nothing else than given sufficient data one can in principle estimate conditional probabilities , and given a direction of the arrows in a bayesian belief network one can translate this information into what the conditional probabilities will be in a modified model ; the situation is more complicated when some variables are unobserved ( un - measured ) .",
    "the _ do - calculus _ of pearl consists of three rules ( a calculus , shown to be complete ) for deciding identifiability when @xmath48 is known and is a dag , and some of the variables are unobserved . the do - calculus can hence be used to determine ( in perhaps quite complex settings ) whether a separate experiment is necessary , or if an hypothetical question can be answered with the data already at hand .",
    "other uses of do - calculus are _ mediation _ , how to separate direct and indirect causal relationships , _ transportability _ , how to determine how much information can be carried over to a new condition , and _ meta - analysis _ , how to pool data obtained under different conditions , for more details see  @xcite .",
    "at the basis of scientific mathematical philosophy is the idea that the regularities of the world are best expressed by how it changes in time , famously stated by newton to leibniz as _ 6accdae13eff7i319n4o4qrr4s8t12ux",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "let us therefore substitute the bayesian belief network in section  [ sec : do - calculus ] by a minimal model encoding the same dependencies as a probabilistic evolution law : @xmath77 the notation is here the same as in ( [ eq : joint - probability - general ] ) except that the variables are now indexed by time ( @xmath78 ) and a possible dependence on exogenous variables has been suppressed . up to the technical simplification of synchronous dynamics , ( [ eq : joint - probability - dynamic ] ) is a prototype for a physically realistic mutual dependency .",
    "it could be realized in a biological regulatory system , say in a signal transduction network , where the cause - effect relationship between @xmath79 and @xmath80 would have the underlying mechanistic interpretation of @xmath79 being the kinases , phosphatases and other enzymes catalyzing the phosphorylation , de - phosphorylation and other modifications to unit @xmath49 .",
    "the endogenous variables @xmath45 are then concentrations of molecules at constant concentrations , which could be sugars and other carbon sources for bacteria , or hormones and other signalling molecules in multi - cellular organisms . for long times the probability distribution in ( [ eq : joint - probability - dynamic ] ) would then reach stationary state which we will denote @xmath81 since @xmath82 in ( [ eq : joint - probability - dynamic ] ) is at least as realistic as @xmath83 in ( [ eq : joint - probability - general ] ) as a representation of how the endogenous variables depend on the exogenous variables we could also use it to define an analogy of the do operation .",
    "we thus have @xmath84 where the last equality says that this is simply the long - time limit of a response function .",
    "generally a response function related to a generic quantity @xmath85 is defined as @xmath86 where @xmath87 is a general parameter which can be varied within the system .",
    "an example , in ferromagnetic systems , is represented by the susceptibility function @xmath88 which gives a measure of the change in the local magnetization @xmath89 on site @xmath49 at time @xmath78 due to a change of an external field @xmath87 acting on a different site @xmath90 at an earlier time @xmath91 . in this respect ,",
    "the _ do _ operation , otherwise stated as an intervention on the system , is similar to the variation of an ( or several ) external parameter(s ) in a physical system which generates a response function .",
    "a main goal of causal analysis can be then reformulated as predicting suitable defined response functions under the change of some external tuneable parameters ( intervention ) .",
    "a great deal is known about such response functions for systems at or near thermodynamic equilibrium where they are related to correlation functions through the fluctuation - dissipation - theorem , which generically takes the form  @xcite @xmath92 = \\int_0^\\tau r(\\tau ' ) d \\tau'\\ ] ] where @xmath93 , time translational invariance is assumed , and @xmath94 is temperature .",
    "we note that the left hand side of above is measured in the unperturbed system and the right hand side in the perturbed system .",
    "causal effect queries are therefore always identifiable in systems at or near thermodynamic equilibrium from observing no more than the correlation between the variable which is set and the variable one wants to predict . the relation between correlation and response has been also used to improve for inference on a network  @xcite .",
    "in this section we describe how the techniques now generally called message - passing or belief propagation can be generalized to analyse evolution laws like ( [ eq : joint - probability - dynamic ] ) .",
    "message - passing techniques have been invented independently in different fields  @xcite . in physics",
    "they are also known as the cavity method  @xcite , and usually traced back to  @xcite .",
    "their purpose is to compute marginal probabilities over some ( usually small ) subset of variables in a probabilistic model described by a factor graph which is done by storing partial computations in nodes representing the variables and then forwarding such partial results to neighbours in the graph for further processing .",
    "message - passing converges and is exact if the underlying graph is a tree but also often converges and is a very good approximation if the underlying graph has only long loops , a fact that has many theoretical and practical applications in coding theory and elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the fixed points of the algorithms correspond to stationary points under variation of the bethe approximation to the free energy in the corresponding statistical mechanics problem @xcite .",
    "our point of departure is now the observation that the dynamics ( [ eq : joint - probability - dynamic ] ) naturally leads to a probability distribution on variable histories @xmath95 where @xmath96 for @xmath97 . before continuing ,",
    "let us note that if the variables are boolean and take values @xmath98 ( `` spins '' ) then ( [ eq : joint - probability - dynamic ] ) specifies a dynamics of a spin system under synchronous updates , and if further all the transition probabilities are of the type @xmath99 is known as the kinetic ising model  @xcite .",
    "the parent set @xmath100 is then comprised of the variables @xmath101 for which @xmath102 is non - zero .",
    "when @xmath103 for all pairs @xmath104 the system has a stationary state @xmath105 and ( [ eq : joint - probability - dynamic ] ) then simulates a system in thermal equilibrium , albeit under the somewhat unphysical synchronous update rule . in the more general case when @xmath106 , and in particular for fully asymmetric models where @xmath102 can only be non - zero when @xmath107 equals to zero , ( [ eq : joint - probability - dynamic ] ) on the other hand simulates a non - equilibrium system .    the first result on reducing the complexity of ( [ eq : joint - probability - history ] )",
    "dates back almost thirty years  @xcite and pertains to fully asymmetric models . for these",
    "an influence @xmath108 must traverse a loop in @xmath48 to get back to @xmath109 , and when there are no loops , or when these can otherwise be disregarded , the marginal probability of @xmath109 is independent of @xmath110 .",
    "this leads to simple equation for the marginalization over a single variable and and single time , namely @xmath111    we now generalize a bit and assume that the dependency graph @xmath48 has the property associated with the effectiveness of standard message - passing _",
    "i.e. _ that it is a tree , or at least locally tree - like .",
    "that is , we assume that one can not form circular dependency chains @xmath112 where @xmath113 unless either somewhere the chain backtracks as @xmath114 or the chain is long , on the order of the graph diameter of @xmath48 . the term `` dynamic cavity '' was introduced in  @xcite for such situations where it was used to obtain rigorous bounds on the consensus threshold for the majority dynamics .",
    "methods have later been developed to treat , in principle exactly , such problems when the dynamical law is modified to only allow transitions in one direction  @xcite .",
    "an important step was taken in  @xcite where marginals in a stationary state were computed approximately based on an ansatz , recently extended to to a perturbative scheme and to also cover transient phenomena  @xcite .",
    "the main problem is then that even when the dependency graph @xmath48 of the dynamics in ( [ eq : joint - probability - dynamic ] ) is locally tree - like this is not the case for dependencies in ( [ eq : joint - probability - history ] ) due to `` loops - in - time '' .",
    "these dependencies have been resolved by a graph expansion technique  @xcite which we now explain .",
    "first , as for the kinetic ising model it is often convenient to define transition functions only up to a normalization @xmath115 .",

    "that is , there will be one ( directed ) dependency graph @xmath48 describing the probabilistic evolution law ( [ eq : joint - probability - dynamic ] ) and another ( undirected ) factor graph @xmath141 describing the probability @xmath82 in ( [ eq : limit ] ) , and @xmath141 will almost always be ( much ) larger and ( much ) richer than @xmath48 . for a worked - out example of such an effect , in the relaxation towards equilibrium of the kinetic ising model on a 1d lattice  @xcite ,",

    "the stark conclusion of these in essence elementary considerations is hence simply that causal analysis should be treated with a great deal of caution .",
    "the causes identified by causal analysis may not be causes at all in the everyday understanding of the word .",
    "instead they may incorporate all kinds of indirect effects from forcing a stationary state of a dynamics to be represented by a bayesian belief network , potentially masking a far simpler underlying reality .",
    "we have given a brief introduction to causal analysis and discussed how it extends the tools of factor graphs and probabilistic models to describe outside interventions that change the models themselves . we have compared and contrasted causal analysis to the analysis of dynamic processes by the dynamic cavity method and pointed out similarities between causal analysis and physical correlation - response theory .    the _ do calculus _ consideres causal relationships to be the fundamental building blocks of reality  @xcite and aims to discover which are these casual dependences in the system under investigation ( usually dag networks ) .",
    "although this certainly is a fascinating goal , it is at odds with physical theory which does not admit causes and effects in the philosophical sense on the fundamental level , but only for macroscopic ( irreversible ) processes . for such processes",
    "the flow of time is however essential , and causes are thus naturally understood as variables influencing transition rates between various states in a system .",
    "the stationary states of such processes are normally quite complicated reflecting not only the the dependencies in the transition rates , but also chains of such dependencies of arbitrary length , the only major exception being systems in thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "therefore , caution is needed when interpreting the results of causal analysis as causes in an everyday  _ e.g _ legal  sense .",
    "the mechanisms identified by causal analysis include ( except in thermal equilibrium ) both underlying direct effects and many kinds of indirect effects where the setting of one variable influences the behaviour of another at a later time through one or many intermediaries .",
    "the major advantage of causal analysis is instead in its relative simplicity of its basic ansatz .",
    "up to recent times few methods except monte carlo simulations were available to analyse the dynamics of non - equilibrium systems , and determining their stationary states was therefore laborious . we have discussed that for some systems the dynamic cavity offers an alternative approach which could therefore be used as an alternative starting point of causal analysis .",
    "many major issues however remain to be solved in that approach , the most important one perhaps being how to extend the dynamic cavity ( if possible ) to continuous - time processes .",
