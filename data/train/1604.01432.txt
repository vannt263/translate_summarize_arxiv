    "it was the goal of obtaining similar results to those of nagel @xcite , but for @xmath95 that led me to work on the problem at hand .",
    "one of the main difficulties of the problem in several dimensions stems from the fact that the polynomial @xmath33 we consider can exhibit different growth rates along different directions .",
    "this is where the john ellipsoids come into play , allowing one to introduce a rescaling that takes care of this issue .    in @xcite , raich and",
    "tinker study a similar problem .",
    "they consider domains @xmath96=p({{\\mathop{\\rm re } } } [ z])\\},$ ] where @xmath97 with @xmath98 a convex polynomial , @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "they obtain a bound for the szeg kernel and its derivatives in terms of the volume of a ball defined by a certain pseudometric , as well as an explicit formula for the szeg kernel when @xmath101      except for the setup of the problem , which is outlined in section [ prelim ] , all the methods we use are classical convex analysis techniques .",
    "in fact , an application of john ellipsoids is the key ingredient in the proof of the main theorem .",
    "in section [ prelim ] we derive an integral formula for the szeg kernel .",
    "our estimates all follow from a study of this integral expression , given by    @xmath102 }   \\left({\\scaleint{8ex}}_{\\bs \\mathbb r^n }   \\frac{e^{2\\pi \\vec{\\eta } \\cdot [ \\vec{x}+\\vec{x ' } - i(\\vec{y'}-\\vec{y } ) ] }    } { \\displaystyle\\int \\limits_{\\mathbb r^n } e^{4\\pi [ \\vec\\eta \\cdot \\vec{v }   - b(\\vec{v})\\tau ] } \\ , d\\vec{v } } \\ , d\\vec{\\eta } \\,\\right ) d\\tau.\\ ] ]    in sections [ coefs ] and [ denominador ] we build the tools that we use in the proof of the main theorem , which is presented in section [ main theorem ] .",
    "we devote section [ coefs ] to a study of the coefficients of convex polynomials in several variables . in the one - variable case it was shown in @xcite",
    "that the absolute value of the coefficients of a convex polynomial with no constant or linear terms can be bounded , up to a constant that depends only on the degree of the polynomial , by the value of the polynomial at @xmath103 it is not possible to obtain such a bound in more variables , since the polynomial might be growing in some directions but not along others .",
    "however , we show that the absolute value of the coefficients can be bounded by the average of the polynomial over a circle of arbitrary positive radius , up to a constant that only depends on the degree of the polynomial and the chosen radius . in section [ denominador ]",
    "we use this result to prove a technical lemma that will be key in dealing with the denominator integral of equation ( [ eq : integral 1 ] ) .",
    "in section [ main theorem ] we present the proof of the main theorem .",
    "the proof is , at its core , an application of john ellipsoids .",
    "we introduce a change of variables in the integral expression for the szeg kernel comprised of factors defined by the length of the axes of the unique maximal inscribed ellipsoid associated to a symmetrization of the convex body @xmath104 the construction of these factors is presented in section [ mus ] , and it is from the product of these factors ( which appear in the denominator as the jacobian of the change of variables ) , that the volume expression in the estimate given in equation ( [ eq : bound principal ] ) is obtained .",
    "so as to make the computations simpler , we have split the proof of the main theorem into the proof of three separate bounds .",
    "the first bound , in terms of @xmath105 is given in section [ delta ] ; the second bound , in terms of @xmath106 is presented in section [ segundo ] ; and the bound in terms of @xmath107 is given in section [ tercer ] .",
    "these bounds are then combined to yield the estimate of the main theorem in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "geometric tools , such as the ones we employ in this paper , have often been used in the study of the szeg kernel .",
    "for example , similar geometric ideas are used by mcneal and stein @xcite to obtain a bound for the szeg kernel @xmath108 for smoothly bounded convex domains @xmath67 of finite type in @xmath109 in terms of the smallest _ tent _ in @xmath110 containing @xmath111 and @xmath107 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "that is , they show that for smoothly bounded convex domains of finite type in @xmath112 there exists a constant @xmath65 so that for all @xmath113    @xmath114    here @xmath115 the projection @xmath116 is a smooth map such that if @xmath117 @xmath118 and @xmath119 is a smooth curve , transversally intersecting @xmath86 at @xmath120 and @xmath121 the geometric constructions used in @xcite and @xcite are based on the length of the sides of a certain polydisc , as opposed to the lengths of the axes of an ellipsoid .",
    "the use of john ellipsoids , however , seems more natural for the domains we consider .",
    "in fact , one of the key components of our proof is the use of universal bounds for the coefficient of convex polynomials in terms of the average of the polynomials over circles of arbitrary positive radius ( as described above , and in more detail in section [ coefs ] ) .",
    "thus , it makes sense to consider ellipsoids ( which can be rescaled into spheres ) , rather than polydiscs .",
    "the particular tools we employ ( i.e , the approximation by john ellipsoids ) have not been used before in this context and provide a new approach to the problem .",
    "in this section we derive an integral formula for the szeg kernel for the domains under consideration . we follow the analogous derivation for the one - dimensional case found in @xcite .",
