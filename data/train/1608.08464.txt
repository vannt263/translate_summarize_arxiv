    "during the last few decades an intensive research activity has been dedicated to the study in fluid dynamics of relative equilibria , sometimes called steady states or v - states .",
    "these vortical structures have the common feature to keep their shape without deformation during the motion and they seem to play a central role in the emergence of coherent structures in turbulent flows at large scales , see for instance @xcite and the references therein .",
    "notice that from experimental standpoint , their existence has been revealed in different geophysical phenomena such as the aerodynamic trailing - vortex problem , the two - dimensional shear layers , saturn s hexagon , the krmn vortex street , and so on .. several numerical and analytical investigations have been carried out in various configurations depending on the topological structure of the vortices : single simply or multiply connected vortices , dipolar or multipolar , see for instance @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we shall be concerned with some refined global structure of the doubly connected rotating patches for the two - dimensional incompressible euler equations .",
    "these equations describe the motion of an ideal fluid and take the form , @xmath0 where @xmath1 refers to the velocity fields and @xmath2 being its vorticity which is defined by the scalar @xmath3 .",
    "note that one can recover the velocity from the vorticity distribution according to the biot - savart law , @xmath4 the global existence and uniqueness of solutions with initial vorticity lying in the space @xmath5 is a very classical fact established many years ago by yudovich @xcite .",
    "this result has the advantage to allow discontinuous vortices taking the form of vortex patches , that is @xmath6 the characteristic function of a bounded domain @xmath7 .",
    "the time evolution of this specific structure is preserved and the vorticity @xmath8 is uniformly distributed in bounded domain @xmath9 , which is nothing but the image by the flow mapping of the initial domain .",
    "the regularity of this domain is not an easy task and was solved by chemin in @xcite who proved that a @xmath10-boundary keeps this regularity globally in time without any loss . in general the dynamics of the boundary is hard to track and is subject to the nonlinear effects created by the induced velocity .",
    "nonetheless , some special family of rotating patches characterized by uniform rotation without changing the shape are known in the literature and a lot of implicit examples have been discovered in the last few decades . note that in this setting we have explicitly @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a planar rotation centered at the origin and with angle @xmath13 ;",
    "for the sake of simplicity we have assumed that the center of rotation is the origin of the frame and the parameter @xmath14 denotes the angular velocity of the rotating domains .",
    "the first example was discovered very earlier by kirchhoff in @xcite who showed that an ellipse of semi - axes @xmath15 and @xmath16 rotates about its center uniformly with the angular velocity @xmath17 .",
    "later , deem and zabusky gave in @xcite numerical evidence of the existence of the v - states with @xmath18fold symmetry for the integers @xmath19 .",
    "few years after , burbea gave in @xcite an analytical proof of the existence using complex analysis formulation and bifurcation theory .",
    "the regularity of the v - states close to rankine vortices was discussed quite recently in @xcite .",
    "we point out that the bifurcation from the ellipses was studied numerically and analytically in @xcite .",
    "all these results are restricted to simply connected domains and the analytical investigation of doubly connected v - states has been initiated with the works @xcite . to fix the terminology ,",
    "a domain @xmath7 is said doubly connected if it takes the form @xmath20 with @xmath21 and @xmath22 being two simply connected bounded domains satisfying @xmath23 . the main result of @xcite which is deeply connected to the aim of this paper deals with the bifurcation from the annular patches where @xmath24 . for the clarity of the discussion we shall recall the main result of @xcite .    [ eulerdoubly ] given @xmath25 and let @xmath26 be a positive integer such that , @xmath27 then there exist two curves of doubly connected rotating patches with m - fold symmetry bifurcating from the annulus @xmath28 at the angular velocities , @xmath29 with @xmath30    we emphasize that the condition is required by the transversality assumption , otherwise the eigenvalues @xmath31 are double and thus the classical theorems in the bifurcation theory such as crandall - rabinowitz theorem @xcite are out of use .",
    "the analysis of the degenerate case corresponding to vanishing discriminant ( in which case @xmath32 has been explored very recently in @xcite .",
    "they proved in particular that for @xmath33 and @xmath34 such that @xmath35 there is no bifurcation to @xmath36-fold v - states .",
    "however for @xmath37 two - fold v - states still bifurcate from the annulus @xmath28 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 being the unique solution in the interval @xmath40 of the equation @xmath41 the proof of this result is by no means non trivial and based on the local structure of the reduced bifurcation equation obtained through the use of lyapunov - schmidt reduction .",
    "note that according to the numerical experiments done in @xcite two different scenarios for global bifurcation are conjectured .",
    "the first one when the eigenvalues @xmath42 and @xmath43 are far enough in which case each branch ends with a singular v - state and the singularity is a corner of for more details about the structure of the limiting v - states we refer the reader to the section @xmath44 in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in the second scenario where the eigenvalues are close enough there is no singularity formation on the boundary and it seems quite evident that there is no spectral gap and the v - states can be constructed for any @xmath45 $ ] , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] taken from @xcite .",
    "moreover , drawing the second fourier coefficient of each conformal mapping that parametrize each boundary as done in we get a small loop passing through the trivial solution at @xmath42 and @xmath46 this suggests that the bifurcation curve starting from @xmath43 will return back to the trivial solution ( annulus ) at @xmath42 .",
    "our main purpose in this paper is to go further in this study by checking analytically the second scenario and provide for @xmath47 the global structure of the bifurcation curves near the degenerate case .",
    "our result reads as follows .",

    "we observe that there is no singularity formation in the boundary.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ]        [ main ] let @xmath47 and @xmath39 be the unique solution in @xmath40 of the equation .",
    "then there exists @xmath49 such that for any @xmath16 in @xmath50 the two curves of @xmath36-fold v - states given by theorem @xmath51 merge and form a loop .",
    "now , we are going to outline the main steps of the proof . roughly speaking we start with writing down the equations governing the boundary @xmath52 of the rotating patches and attempt to follow the approach developed in @xcite .",
    "for @xmath53 , let @xmath54 be the conformal mapping which enjoys the following structure , @xmath55 we have denoted by @xmath56 the complement of the open unit disc @xmath57 and we have also assumed that the fourier coefficients of the conformal mappings are real which means that we look for v - states which have at least one axis of symmetry that can be chosen to be the real axis . it is also important to mention that the domain @xmath7 is implicitly assumed to be smooth enough , more than @xmath58 as we shall see in the proof , and therefore each conformal mapping can be extended up to the boundary . according to the subsection @xmath59 the conformal mappings",
    "satisfy the coupled equations : for @xmath60 @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 here @xmath64 denotes the complex integration over the unit circle @xmath65 .",
    "the linearized operator around the annulus defined through @xmath66_{|t=0}\\ ] ] plays a significant role in the proof and according to @xcite it acts as a matrix fourier multiplier .",
    "actually , for @xmath67 chosen in suitable banach space with @xmath68 we have the expression @xmath69 where for @xmath70 the matrix @xmath71 is given by @xmath72 it is known from @xcite that for given @xmath26 the values of @xmath16 such that @xmath73 is singular , for suitable values of @xmath74 , belong to the interval @xmath75 where @xmath39 has been introduced in .",
    "it is also shown in that paper that the assumptions of crandall - rabinowitz theorem are satisfied , especially the transversality assumption which reduces the bifurcation study to some properties of the linearized operator .",
    "this latter property is no longer true for @xmath76 and we have double eigenvalues @xmath77 . this is a degenerate case and we know from @xcite that there is no bifurcation .",
    "it seems that the approach implemented in this situation can be carried out for @xmath78 but close enough to @xmath39 .",
    "in fact , using lyapunov - schmidt reduction ( through appropriate projections ) we transform the infinite - dimensional problem into a two dimensional one",
    ". therefore the v - states equation reduces to the resolution of an equation of the type @xmath79 with @xmath80 being a smooth function and note that when @xmath76 the point @xmath81 is a critical point for @xmath80 and for that reason one should expand @xmath80 to the second order around this point in order to understand the resolvability of the reduced equation . at the order",
    "two @xmath80 is strictly convex and therefore locally the critical point is the only solution for @xmath82 reproducing this approach in the current setting and after long and involved computations we find that for @xmath83 close enough , for example , to the solution @xmath84    @xmath85 with @xmath86 notice that @xmath87 and moreover for @xmath16 belonging to a small interval @xmath88 we get @xmath89 as we can easily check from the preceding facts , the zeros of the associated quadratic form of @xmath80 is a small ellipse . therefore by perturbation arguments , we may show that the solutions of @xmath80 are actually a perturbation in a strong topology of the ellipse",
    ". consequently the solutions of @xmath80 around the point @xmath84 can be parametrized by a smooth jordan curve .",
    "we remark that in addition to the known trivial solution @xmath84 one can find a second one , of course different from the preceding one , in the form @xmath90 , corresponding geometrically to the same annulus @xmath28 . around this point",
    "@xmath90 the obtained curve describes a bifurcating curve of v - states with exactly @xmath18fold symmetry and therefore from the local description of the bifurcation diagram stated in theorem [ eulerdoubly ] we deduce that @xmath91 .",
    "this means the formation of loops as stated in our main theorem .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ remind ] we shall introduce some tools , formulate the v - states equations and write down the reduced bifurcation equation using lyapunov - schmidt reduction .",
    "section [ bifurcationnearthedegeneratecase ] is devoted to taylor expansion at order two of the reduced bifurcation equation and the complete proof of theorem [ main ] will be given in the last section .",
    "we shall recall in this section some tools that we shall frequently use throughout the paper and write down the reduced bifurcation equation which is the first step towards the proof of but before that we will fix some notations . the unit disc and its boundary will be denoted respectively by @xmath57 and @xmath65 . and @xmath92 is the planar disc of radius @xmath93 and centered at the origin . given a continuous function @xmath94",

    ". the boundary of @xmath113 will be denoted by @xmath114 . then according to @xcite we find that that the exterior conformal mappings @xmath115 and @xmath116 associated to @xmath21 and @xmath22 satisfy the coupled nonlinear equations . for @xmath117 @xmath118 with @xmath119 note",
    "that we have introduced @xmath120 because it is more convenient for the computations and @xmath121 the integrals are defined in the complex sense and we shall focus on v - states which are small perturbation of the annulus @xmath122 with @xmath34 . the conformal mappings @xmath123 with @xmath53 admit the expansions , @xmath124 with @xmath125 define @xmath126 then the equations of the v - states become , @xmath127 with @xmath128 note that the annulus is a solution for any angular velocity , that is , @xmath129 and the set @xmath130 will be called the set of trivial solutions .      for any integer @xmath33 , the existence of v - states was proved in @xcite provided @xmath131 that guarantee the transversality assumption .",
    "the idea is to check that the functional @xmath132 has non trivial zeros using bifurcation arguments .",
    "however , and as we have mentioned before in the introduction , the knowledge of the linearized operator around the trivial solution is not enough to understand the structure of the bifurcating curves near the degenerate case corresponding to double eigenvalues . to circumvent this difficulty we make an expansion at order two of the reduced bifurcation equation in the spirit of @xcite , and this will be the subject of the current task .",
    "let us first introduce banach spaces that we shall use and recall the algebraic structure of the linearize operator .",

    "we have already seen in the subsection [ linearized operator and lyapunov - schmidt reduction ] that the vectorial conformal mapping @xmath492 that describes the bifurcation curve from @xmath84 is decomposed as follows @xmath493 where @xmath494 has been defined in . as the relationship between the sets @xmath495 and @xmath463",

    "note that looking from the side @xmath90 this curve represents v - states with exactly @xmath36-fold symmetry and not with more symmetry ; to be convinced see the structure of @xmath499 .",
    "however from the local bifurcation diagram close to the trivial solution which was studied in @xcite we know that the only v - states bifurcating from the trivial solutions with @xmath36-fold symmetry bifurcate from the points @xmath84 and @xmath500 .",
    "consequently we get @xmath91 and this shows that the bifurcation curves of the @xmath18fold v - states merge and form a small loop .    the last point to prove concerns the symmetry of the curve @xmath495 with respect to the @xmath145 axis",
    "this reduces to check that for @xmath501 then @xmath502 . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath112 is an @xmath36-fold doubly - connected v - state , its boundaries are parametrized by the conformal mappings @xmath503 hence we find that the vectorial conform mapping @xmath499 admits the decomposition @xmath504 observe that we have a unique @xmath202 such that @xmath505 now we consider @xmath506 , the rotation of d with the angle @xmath507 .",
