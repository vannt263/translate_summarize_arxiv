    "the use of type ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) to probe cosmological parameters relies on the possibility to calibrate the absolute magnitude of individual sne from the observed luminosity evolution ( for a review see , e.g.  , branch 1998 ) .",
    "pskovskii ( 1977 ) first suggested that brighter sne  ia decline more slowly than dimmer ones .",
    "this was later confirmed by phillips ( 1993 ) .",
    "using modern data for a small sample of well observed local sne  ia he showed that the relation exists in the @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 bands , but it is steepest in @xmath4 . the relation between maximum @xmath4 brightness and the number of magnitudes the @xmath4 band declines in the first 15 days after maximum , a quantity called @xmath3 , is commonly referred to as the phillips relation .",
    "hamuy et  al .",
    "( 1995 , 1996b ) confirmed the relation using a bigger sample of objects , although their slopes were flatter than phillips original values .",
    "riess et al .",
    "( 1995 ) used a more sophisticated approach based on the analysis of the entire early light curve , which allows the sn maximum brightness to be determined by comparison with a set of template light curves of objects whose distance and reddening are assumed to be known .",
    "however , the absolute magnitude - light curve shape relation is not yet calibrated exactly , as is shown by the differences among recent work ( riess et al .",
    "1995 , 1998 ) .",
    "although the relation between sn  ia brightness and decline rate has been used extensively , its physical bases are not yet understood .",
    "several groups have published synthetic light curves obtained from explosion models which differ in many of their properties ( progenitor wd mass , mode of the explosion ) .",
    "these light curves span a wide range of maximum brightness and decline rates , and although there are models that appear to reproduce some of the observations , a fully consistent picture is still lacking . in this paper",
    "we explore the possibility that a series of chandrasekhar - mass explosion models , which differ essentially in the amount of @xmath0ni  they synthesize , can explain the observed range of light curves and spectra of at least _ spectroscopically normal _",
    "sne ia synthesize significant amounts of radioactive @xmath0ni , and their light curves are powered by the deposition in the expanding sn ejecta of the @xmath7-rays and positrons produced by the decay chain @xmath0ni@xmath8 @xmath0co@xmath8 @xmath0fe .",
    "the shape of the light curve of a sn  ia near maximum depends essentially on the fact that optical photons emitted upon the deposition and thermalization of the @xmath7-rays and positrons do not immediately escape from the sn .",
    "these photons must in fact first propagate through the optically thick sn ejecta , where they interact with spectral lines and free electrons until they are redshifted into a region of the spectrum where the opacity is low and they can escape . since the opacity is dominated by line processes , these regions correspond to wavelengths where line opacity is low .",
    "this gives rise to the very characteristic sn ia spectrum , with broad absorption features and few p - cygni emissions , which correspond to these opacity windows ( e.g.  pinto & eastman 2000 , mazzali 2000 ) .",
    "since it takes photons a finite time to emerge from the ejecta in what is essentially a random walk process , very soon after the explosion the sn luminosity is lower than the energy input into the ejecta .",
    "maximum light occurs when the instantaneous rates of deposition of hard radiation and emission of optical light are roughly equal ( arnett 1982 ) .",
    "as time goes on , the delay between energy deposition and emission of optical radiation becomes smaller and smaller . at late times , in the so - called nebular phase , @xmath7-ray deposition becomes less efficient , and a significant contribution to the light curve is made by the positrons , which are supposed to deposit _ in situ _ if a weak magnetic field is present in the ejecta .",
    "positrons carry only about 3.5% of the total decay energy .",
    "the properties of the peak of a sn  ia light curve have been studied analytically by arnett ( 1982 , 1996 ) .",
    "the basic features are :    1 .",
    "the brightness of the light curve at maximum is proportional to the mass of synthesized @xmath0ni .",
    "the width of the light curve @xmath9 depends on the ejected mass , the kinetic energy of the explosion and the optical opacity as follows : @xmath10    here @xmath11 is the ejected mass ( i.e.  the wd mass , since sne  ia are not supposed to leave a remnant behind ) , @xmath12 is the kinetic energy of explosion and @xmath13 is the grey opacity to optical photons .",
    "that sne  ia do indeed synthesize different amounts of @xmath0ni  is an established observational fact .",
    "spectroscopically ` normal ' sne  ia produce roughly 0.5 m@xmath14 , but extreme cases range from 0.1 m@xmath14  for sn  1991bg ( filippenko et  al .",
    "1992 ) to about 1 m@xmath14  for sn  1991 t ( spyromilio et  al .  1992 ) .",
    "these extreme cases are spectroscopically peculiar sne .",
    "however , even among ` normal ' sne  ia a distribution of properties is observed ( nugent et  al .  1995 , fisher et  al .",
    "1995 ) , which is quite likely the result of different synthesized @xmath0ni  masses ( mazzali et  al .",
    "1998 , contardo et  al .",
    "can these differences in the mass of @xmath0ni  influence not only the peak brightness , but also the width of the light curves ?",
    "one possibility is to assume that all sne  ia are self - similar events , but that the progenitor masses , hence @xmath11 , are different , so that all other parameters ( @xmath0ni  mass , @xmath12 ) scale accordingly .",
    "this could explain the observations in a rather straightforward manner .",
    "however , this interpretation implies that sub - chandrasekhar events , and possibly super - chandrasekhar ones ( e.g.  sn  1991 t , fisher et  al .",
    "1999 ) are very common , since such events would be necessary to explain not only spectroscopically peculiar events , but also the faint end of the ` normal ' sn  ia sequence ( see e.g.  cappellaro et  al .",
    "this is currently not a favourite scenario among the ` explosive ' community , since sub - chandrasekhar explosions that have the correct element distribution are difficult to design ( e.g. , hillebrandt & niemeyer 2000 ) .",
    "another possibility is a change of @xmath12 only .",
    "however , @xmath12 is produced in almost equal amounts by burning a given mass to nse ( i.e.  mostly to @xmath0ni ) , or by incomplete burning to intermediate mass elements ( ime ) such as si and s. therefore , one can expect that those sne which synthesize more @xmath0niare not likely to have a much higher @xmath12 than sne which produce less @xmath0ni , unless the total mass burned ( to nse or to ime s ) is also larger . since in most models",
    "the wd is almost completely burned to either @xmath0ni  or to ime s , ( @xmath151.3 m@xmath14  for a chandrasekhar mass white dwarf , nomoto et  al .",
    "1984 , 1994 , woosley & weaver 1994 ) there is not much room for a large @xmath16 variation if the mass of the progenitor wd is constant . also , the width of the light curve depends only weakly on @xmath12 .",
    "so , if we want to restrict ourselves to chandrasekhar - mass explosions , a variation in the opacity @xmath13 is the most promising direction to follow .",
    "many models exist of chandrasekhar - mass explosions .",
    "models differing in the details of burning and flame propagation can produce different amounts of @xmath0ni  ( usually in the range 0.4  0.8 m@xmath14 ) and display different light curves ( see , e.g. , hflich et  al .",
    "1995 , 1998 and references therein ) .",
    "different masses of @xmath0ni  lead naturally to different sn brightnesses .    among the possible physical reasons that could make a sn  ia explosion synthesize different amounts of @xmath0ni",
    "are a different value of the deflagration speed ( caused by a different buoyancy force ) or of the density at which the burning wave makes a transition from a deflagration to a detonation ( ddt ) .",
    "umeda et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) suggested that a different c / o ratio in the progenitor wd may cause a variation in the deflagration speed or in the deflagration - to - detonation transition density @xmath17 .",
    "iwamoto et  al .",
    "( 1999 , see also brachwitz et al .",
    "2000 ) computed the explosion hydrodynamics and the nucleosynthesis for three representative cases of @xmath17 . in their models ,",
    "the explosion starts as a slow deflagration , leading to the synthesis of a small amount ( @xmath18 m@xmath14 ) of fe - group isotopes ( @xmath19fe , @xmath0fe , @xmath20fe , @xmath20ni ) .",
    "the exact ratios of these isotopes depend on the value of the electron fraction @xmath21 , which in turn depends on the central density and composition of the wd and on the flame speed .",
    "meanwhile the wd expands , electron capture decreases and as the burning proceeds further out radioactive @xmath0ni  is mostly synthesized .",
    "eventually , the deflagration enters the region of incomplete si burning and explosive o burning , where the transition to a detonation occurs . in the detonated region , both @xmath0ni  and ime s",
    "are produced .",
    "the amount of @xmath0ni  produced in the detonated layer ( after ddt ) is sensitive to @xmath17 . for a higher value of @xmath17 ,",
    "the detonated regions reach higher temperatures because of smaller specific heats , and so more @xmath0ni  is produced and the sn  ia is brighter .",
    "the ws15 series of models : dd1 , dd2 and dd3 of iwamoto et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) synthesize 0.56 , 0.69 and 0.77 m@xmath14  of @xmath0ni , respectively , for values of @xmath17 ranging from 1.7 to @xmath22 g  @xmath23 .",
    "the three models ws15 have the same slow deflagration speed ( 1.5% of the sound speed ) , thus the amount of @xmath0ni  synthesized in the deflagration zone is the same and the difference in the masses of @xmath0ni  synthesized is due entirely to the different @xmath17 .",
    "an interesting property of the models presented by iwamoto et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) is that the total mass of fe - peak elements ( mostly @xmath0ni ) plus ime s is roughly constant ( @xmath24 m@xmath14 ) , so that all models also have about the same @xmath12 ( @xmath25erg ) .",
    "note that such a small range of @xmath12 would introduce a change of only less than 2% in @xmath26 .",
    "it is therefore safe to ignore these differences .",
    "therefore both @xmath12 and @xmath11 are eliminated from eq.(1 ) and only the dependence of @xmath9 on @xmath13 remains .",
    "this feature makes these models particularly appealing for an investigation of their photometric and spectroscopic properties .",
    "the idea is to verify whether such a spread in the properties of the models can explain the observed spread of properties of at least _ spectroscopically normal _",
    "sne  ia .",
    "the question is how can a different @xmath0ni / ime ratio affect @xmath13 .",
    "there seem to be two ways that this can happen .",
    "one is that more @xmath0ni  leads to more heating and therefore to a larger @xmath13 ( khokhlov et  al .",
    "1993 , hflich et  al .",
    "however , since most of the @xmath0ni  is not mixed , an increase in the total production of @xmath0ni  does not immediately translate into a higher temperature .",
    "the other possibility stems from the consideration that the opacity in the ejecta of a sn  ia is dominated by line opacity of low ionization species .",
    "pauldrach et  al .",
    "( 1995 ) showed that the @xmath27 surface in w7-type ejecta at an epoch of 25 days falls at @xmath28 km  s@xmath29 , which is significantly less than the photospheric velocity at that epoch . in the conditions that apply in a sn",
    "ia near maximum , the time a photon spends scattering in lines as it redshifts its way out of the expanding envelope is much shorter than the time spent travelling from one line to the next redder line ( pinto & eastman 2000 , mazzali 2000 ) .",
    "the crossing of each line in frequency space can thus be treated as a single scattering event , so that the opacity depends simply on the number of active lines , which in turn depends on which elements dominate the composition . in particular ,",
    "low excitation ions of fe - group elements ( fe  i  fe  iii , co  i ",
    "co  iii , ni  i  ni  iii  etc . ) have many more lines ( about a factor of 10 ) than low excitation ions of ime s ( si  i ",
    "si  ii , s  i  s  ii , ca  i ",
    "ca  ii  etc . ) .",
    "it may therefore not be unreasonable to expect that the average opacity is higher in regions where the abundance of the fe - group elements is higher . on average",
    ", one can therefore expect that sne with a higher @xmath0ni / ime production ratio also have a higher opacity .",
    "since our aim was to test one basic aspect of the light curve , namely the dependence on the composition of the ejecta , we chose to simplify the input as much as possible .",
    "in particular , since the models published by iwamoto et  al .  ( 1999 ) have similar density distributions ( because they have similar @xmath16 , @xmath30erg ) , we adopted the w7 ( nomoto et  al .",
    "1984 ) distribution as an average for all models .",
    "this is a reasonable approximation because @xmath31 does not change greatly among different chandrasekhar - mass explosion models , and w7 is a good representation of the typical @xmath31 .",
    "however , if the mass of @xmath0ni  translates more or less directly into luminosity at maximum , the spread in @xmath0ni  mass of the iwamoto et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) models corresponds to a spread of maximum brightness of only about 0.35 mag .",
    "this is less than the observed spread of ` normal ' sne  ia ( @xmath32 mag ) .",
    "therefore , we constructed models which produce 0.4 , 0.6 and 0.8 m@xmath14  of @xmath0ni , respectively , corresponding to @xmath33 g  @xmath23 ( iwamoto et  al .  1999 ; umeda et  al .",
    "1999 ) .    in order to do this we followed the properties of the ws15 dd series of models by iwamoto et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) . in these models , @xmath0ni  is synthesized outside of an enclosed mass of @xmath18 m@xmath14 , and it is the dominant element in the ejecta until the ime region is reached .",
    "models with different masses of @xmath0ni  are therefore characterized by a different outer extent of the @xmath0ni - dominated shell .",
    "therefore we placed the interface between the @xmath0ni  and the ime - dominated regions at the mass coordinate appropriate to reach the required value of the @xmath0ni  mass .",
    "the abundance distribution of our parametrised models is shown in fig.1 .",
    "using only two main contributions to the opacity , i.e.  binning all elements into either fe - group or ime , is also a step towards simplifying the models , and it is justified because none of the lighter ions have such a complicated level structure as any of the dominant fe - group ions .",
    "it should be noticed that the distribution of @xmath0ni  in velocity space in the simple models we constructed compares favourably with the velocity of the @xmath0ni  sphere derived by mazzali et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) when fitting the width of the fe  ii ] and fe  iii ] emission lines in normal sne  ia at late times .",
    "in order to test the properties of these explosion models we adopt a 2-step approach .",
    "first we compute the _",
    "bolometric _ light curves using a monte carlo code ( cappellaro et  al .",
    "our input models consist of a density - velocity distribution , and three basic contributions to the composition are singled out .",
    "in fact , for each of the shells into which the ejecta are divided in our calculation we input the initial @xmath0ni  abundance , @xmath34 , according to which @xmath7-rays are injected in the appropriate shell following the decay law , and the total abundance of the fe - group elements , @xmath35 , which includes @xmath0ni  and its daughter nuclei but also stable isotopes such as @xmath19fe , @xmath0fe , and @xmath20ni .",
    "these contribute to the opacity but are not sources of @xmath7-rays .",
    "the remaining fraction of a shell s mass is attributed to ime s .    as a first approximation",
    ", we initially adopted a formula for @xmath13 which depends only on the relative abundance of fe - group and ime . since on average the number of active lines in an fe - group is about 10 times larger than in an ime ion",
    ", we define the optical opacity as : @xmath36.\\ ] ] the opacity is assigned a value in each of the shells into which the ejecta have been divided . with this formula",
    ", @xmath13 ranges from 0.25 @xmath37 g@xmath29 in regions where fe - group dominates to 0.025 @xmath37 g@xmath29 in regions where fe - group is absent , and has a value 0.1375 @xmath37 g@xmath29 if the composition is 50% fe - group and 50% ime .",
    "this is a reasonable representation of the value of @xmath13 ( see khokhlov et  al .",
    "1993 , figure 24 ) .",
    "however , the bolometric light curves computed with this formulation of the opacity peak too soon ( @xmath38  16 days ) and drop too rapidly : @xmath39 for these light curves ranges from 0.75 mag for model ni08 to 0.85 mag for model ni04 .",
    "typical risetimes of local sne  ia are about 1920 days ( riess et  al .",
    "1999 ) , and values of @xmath39 for normal sne  ia range from 0.9 to 1.2 mag ( contardo et  al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the basic properties of the synthetic bolometric light curves computed with this formulation of the opacity are summarized in table 1 .",
    "as expected , models which produce more @xmath0ni  are brighter and decline more slowly . in figure 2 the synthetic light curves are compared to the @xmath42 light curves of 3 spectroscopically normal sne which have different values of @xmath43 : sn  1990n ( @xmath44 mag ) ; sn  1994d ( @xmath45 mag ) and sn  1992a ( @xmath46 mag ) .",
    "the observed @xmath42 light curves have been shifted along the y - axis to obtain a best overall match to the synthetic light curves , which are not meant to be detailed fits of these sne .",
    "the @xmath42 light curve of sn  1990n was computed using the cepheid distance modulus @xmath47 mag ( saha et  al .",
    "1997 ) and shifted upwards by 0.1 mag .",
    "the light curve of sn  1992a was taken from suntzeff ( 1996 ) , who used an sbf distance modulus @xmath48 mag , and shifted upwards by 0.8 mag , resulting in a distance modulus @xmath49 mag , which is consistent with the gclf distance @xmath50 mag published by della valle et  al .",
    "both of these sne are therefore compatible with the long distance scale .",
    "finally , the light curve of sn  1994d was computed using the recently published gclf distance modulus @xmath51 mag ( drenkhahn & richtler 1999 ) . however , this light curve had to be shifted upwards by as much as 0.75 mag to match the light curve of model ni06 , so that the distance used for the plot in figure 2 is @xmath52 mag .",
    "although this appears to be inconsistent with the gclf distance , we note that sn  1994d had an sbf distance modulus @xmath53 mag ( hamuy et  al .",
    "typically , gclf distance are larger than sbf ones , so the distance we have used for figure 2 may not be inconsistent with the long distance scale .",
    "also , @xmath43 of model ni06 matches very closely the same quantity for sn  1994d ( see table 2 ) .",
    "although the synthetic bolometric light curves match the @xmath42 ones reasonably well , the decline of the bolometric light curves in the 15 days following maximum is smaller than the observed @xmath4-band decline .",
    "however , the observed @xmath4-band decline is faster than the observed @xmath5-band decline , and the observed sn  ia colour changes from @xmath54 at maximum to @xmath55 at two weeks after maximum , so the fast decline of the @xmath4 magnitude must be at least partially the result of a change towards the red of the colour of the spectrum .",
    "note that all light curves reach maximum about 18 days after the explosion , although the brightest model reaches maximum somewhat later .",
    "we used our monte carlo spectrum synthesis code ( mazzali & lucy 1993 , lucy 1999 , mazzali 2000 ) to compute synthetic spectra for the three models .",
    "the code requires as input a hydrodynamical model of the explosion and values for the luminosity @xmath56 and the photospheric velocity @xmath57 at an epoch @xmath58 .",
    "we can take both @xmath56 and @xmath57 from the light curve calculations . however , such calculations are known to give a poor representation of the photospheric velocity , in particular at times past maximum ( fig .",
    "3 ) . at those epochs codes",
    "overestimate the velocities , most likely because the approximation of a gray photosphere is not valid at all wavelengths ( khokhlov et  al .",
    "1993 , hflich et  al .",
    "1995 , iwamoto et  al .",
    "2000 , mazzali , iwamoto & nomoto 2000 ) .",
    "therefore , we can use @xmath57 values from the light curve calculations to compute synthetic spectra at maximum , but we have to rely on velocity information from observed spectra to compute spectra at 15 days after maximum .",
    "we also computed spectra at one week before maximum , for completeness , using both @xmath56 and @xmath57 from the light curve calculations . for each synthetic spectrum calculation , we used a ratio of fe - group v. ime obtained by mixing the compositions of the layers above the photosphere in the particular explosion model .",
    "the relative abundances of the ime s are based on the explosion model w7 , and for the fe - group the decay of @xmath0ni  into @xmath0co  and @xmath0fe  was taken into account .",
    "stable fe - group elements are buried deep in the ejecta , and they do not influence the spectra .",
    "the integrated photometry from the synthetic spectra was used to compute @xmath43 .",
    "we obtained @xmath43 values ranging from 1.1 to 1.5 mag .",
    "these values are comparable to those of observed spectroscopically normal sne  ia . the numbers for the three models are given in table 2 .",
    "finally , we compare our synthetic spectra for the epochs @xmath59 days , maximum and @xmath60 days with the spectra of the same sne used in figure 2 for the light curve comparison .",
    "we use spectra taken at epochs as close as possible to those of the models .",
    "figure 4 shows the pre - maximum spectra , figure 5 the spectra at maximum light and figure 6 the spectra at 15 days after maximum .",
    "the observed spectra have been corrected for redshift but not for reddening , which is however small .",
    "the values of @xmath43 for the various sne are given in the figures .",
    "no attempt was made to obtain detailed fits to the spectra .",
    "the synthetic spectra appear to resemble the observed ones .",
    "it is remarkable that spectra obtained from such different models are actually not very different .",
    "this is because at a given epoch the photosphere is located at lower velocities in models that produce less @xmath0ni , at least after about day 10 ( see fig .",
    "3 ) , but since the luminosity is also lower in these models the effective temperatures in the three models are similar .",
    "this is consistent with the results of nugent et  al .",
    "also , the abundances in the layers that form the spectra , especially at and before maximum , are not much affected by the deep layers , and so the spectra are relatively insensitive to the large differences in @xmath0ni  mass .",
    "using a set of light curves and spectra computed for three representative models we have shown that the differences in the observed properties of sne  ia all having chandrasekhar - mass progenitors but producing different amounts of @xmath0ni  reproduce the observed dispersion of properties of at least _ spectroscopically normal _",
    "our calculation procedure is not fully self - consistent because the photospheric velocities obtained from the light curve calculations are not always reliable , especially after maximum , and we had to use estimates from observed spectra .",
    "nevertheless , the results are encouraging .",
    "calculations with a self - consistent code ( e.g.  nugent et  al .",
    "1997 ) could give more reliable results .",
    "the range of properties displayed by the models we have studied is sufficient to encompass the observed properties of _ spectroscopically normal _",

    "sne  ia , such as sne 1991 t and 1991bg , seem to be well outside this range , especially from a spectroscopic point of view . for sn  1991 t",
    "there is spectroscopic evidence that @xmath0ni  was present also in the outer part of the ejecta ( mazzali et  al .",
    "1995 ) , which would seem to require a different explosion model ( e.g.  yamaoka et al .",
    "sn  1991bg , on the other hand , was so faint and its light evolution so fast that it may be difficult to explain it within the framework of chandrasekhar - mass explosions .",
