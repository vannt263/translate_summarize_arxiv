    "biological cells exhibit complex patterns of intracellular traffic : vesicles shuttle between different cellular compartments , others travel from the cell center to the periphery or vice versa , but also filaments , rna , chromosomes , and even viruses are permanently on the move within cells @xcite .",
    "an extreme example is the long - ranged transport of vesicles , organelles , and proteins along the axons of nerve cells @xcite , which can be up to a meter long . all this traffic",
    "is based on the molecular motors kinesins , dyneins and myosins which move along cytoskeletal filaments @xcite .",
    "these motors catalyze a chemical reaction , the hydrolysis of atp ( adenosinetriphosphate ) , and transform the free energy released from this reaction into active movements and mechanical work . in the following , we focus on processive cytoskeletal motors which can make many chemo - mechanical steps while staying bound to a filament , in particular on the large - scale traffic driven by these motors @xcite .",
    "these molecular motors exhibit movements on several length and time scales which range between nanometers and millimeters or centimeters ( up to a meter in axons ) and between microseconds and days , respectively @xcite : ( i ) the single step of a motor typically has a size of the order of @xmath0  nm , and is generated through the amplification of nanometer - sized conformational changes in the catalytic domain of the motor .",
    "the chemical cycle takes typically of the order of @xmath1  s , but the actual physical displacement is much faster , being almost instantaneous on this time scale .",
    "( ii ) on scales of one or a few microns , the motors perform active walks along cytoskeletal filaments and move in a directed fashion with a velocity of @xmath2 @xmath3 m/s .",
    "( iii ) on larger length and time scales which exceed a few microns or a few seconds , respectively , the motors perform peculiar motor walks , which consist of alternating sequences of active directed walks along filaments and passive non - directed diffusion in the surrounding fluid environment upon unbinding from filaments @xcite .",
    "these motor walks are a consequence of the fact that molecular motors function in a noisy environment , and that the motor  filament binding energy can be overcome by thermal fluctuations .",
    "theoretical investigations of molecular motors have largely focused on movements on the intermediate scale ( ii ) , motivated by single - molecule experiments developed during the last 15 years which made the direct observation of the active motor walks possible , see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "these active walks have been studied using a variety of modeling approaches such as various types of ratchet models ( reviewed in @xcite ) , chemical kinetics models and discrete brownian ratchets @xcite and brownian networks @xcite .",
    "only little has been done on the dynamics of the single step , i.e. , on movements in regime ( i ) , because the duration of a motor cycle still exceeds the time scale accessible to molecular dynamics simulations .    the movements over large time and lengths scales , i.e.  in regime ( iii ) , have recently been studied in some detail .",
    "our group has introduced a class of lattice models which allows us to study the combination of active walks along filaments and diffusion in a rather generic way without making assumptions on the underlying motor mechanisms , and , at the same time , to describe specific motors by adapting the parameters to the measured transport properties @xcite .",
    "these models also apply to various types of motor particles which consist of cargo particles with one or several molecular motors attached .    using these models",
    ", many properties of the large - scale motor walks can be calculated analytically @xcite .",
    "in addition , these lattice models can be used to study motor  motor interactions which are easily incorporated .",
    "the most obvious such interaction is the mutual exclusion or hard - core repulsion which leads to traffic jams on crowded filaments @xcite . in that case , these models constitute a new class of driven diffusive systems or exclusion processes : in contrast to driven lattice models studied in the context of non - equilibrium phase transitions , e.g. @xcite , and vehicular traffic @xcite , the driving , i.e.  the active movement is localized to the filaments and coupled to non - driven diffusion through the binding / unbinding dynamics .",
    "these new driven lattice models have been studied quite extensively both by our group @xcite and by several other groups @xcite .",
    "one particularly interesting system is a tube - like cylindrical compartment with filaments aligned in parallel to the cylinder axis in an isopolar fashion , which mimics the geometry of an axon .",
    "since the lattice models for molecular motors are driven systems , the boundary conditions are crucial for the resulting behavior . in our previous work ,",
    "we have studied tube - like compartments with several types of boundary conditions : periodic boundary conditions @xcite , closed boundaries @xcite , and open boundaries , which are coupled to motor reservoirs @xcite .",
    "the latter systems exhibit boundary - induced phase transitions .    in this article",
    ", we consider a half - open tube which is coupled to a motor reservoir at one end , but has a closed or reflecting wall at the other end .",
    "we consider the two cases of motors moving towards the open and towards the closed end .",
    "this geometry is inspired by the geometry of the axon @xcite , which has a closed end at the axon terminal , but , at the other end , is connected to the cell body , where the motors are synthesized and which therefore acts as a motor reservoir .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ secmodel ] , we introduce the model , in section [ secphases ] , we present the general properties of these systems and discuss the phase transition that is obtained when switching the direction of motor motility .",
    "we then characterize the motor traffic jams in section [ secjam ] where we use an adsorption equilibrium approximation to obtain analytical results . in the appendix ,",
    "the same method is applied to the closed tube system studied in @xcite .",
    "we close with a short summary of our results .",
    "to mimic transport in an axon , we study the traffic of motor particles in a half - open cylindrical tube with a single filament located along its cylinder axis .",
    "the tube has length @xmath4 and radius @xmath5 .",
    "the bound motors move along the filament and the unbound motors diffuse freely within the cylinder , see figure [ figlatticemodel ] . at the right end",
    ", the tube is closed , i.e.no motors can leave or enter the system .",
    "this mimics the synaptic terminal of the axon . at the left end ,",

    "@xmath7 , while the right end is closed .",
    "motor particles bound to the filament perform active movements with velocity @xmath8 , while unbound motors perform symmetric diffusion with diffusion constant @xmath9 . in the lattice models ,",
    "these movements are described by the forward step probability @xmath10 on the filament and the symmetric hopping probability @xmath11 to each neighbour site for unbound motors .",
    "in addition , unbound motors which reach the filament bind to it with probability @xmath12 , and bound motors unbind from the filament through steps to adjacent non - filament sites which occur with probability @xmath13 per non - filament neighbour site . the motors",
    "interact via hard core exclusion.,width=491 ]    each motor can be in two states : bound to the filament , where it moves actively to the right with velocity @xmath8 , and unbound , where it performs symmetric diffusion with diffusion constant @xmath9 .",
    "the filament is taken to lie along the @xmath14-axis , so that the system is characterized by the bound motor density @xmath15 and the unbound motor density @xmath16 .",
    "as in @xcite , we neglect the variation of the unbound motor density @xmath17 with the transverse coordinates @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the motors can unbind from or bind to the filament . since the motors are strongly attracted by the filament , the binding rate @xmath20 is taken to be large compared to the unbinding rate @xmath21",
    "when motors come close to each other , they may interact . in our simple model",
    "we include only hard core exclusion which prevents motors from occupying the same site . in a mean field treatment , this can be taken into account by using exclusion factors of the form @xmath22 or @xmath23 .",
    "we are interested in the stationary states of the system .",
    "since the right tube end is closed , the net current vanishes in the stationary state .",
    "thus , the directed bound current of motors , @xmath24 , and the unbound diffusive motor current , @xmath25 , must balance to give zero total current : @xmath26 here the unbound diffusive current has been integrated over the tube cross section .",
    "the prefactor @xmath27 describes the area available for unbound diffusion . for large radii r , @xmath28 .",
    "furthermore , in the stationary state , the in- and outgoing currents balance on any filament site which leads to @xmath29          = { \\pi_0}{\\rho_{{\\mathrm{ub}}}}(1-{\\rho_{{\\mathrm{b } } } } ) - { \\epsilon_0}{\\rho_{{\\mathrm{b}}}}(1-{\\rho_{{\\mathrm{ub}}}})\\ ] ] where the small diffusive part of the bound current has been neglected .",
    "the change of the bound current drives the system out of adsorption equilibrium for which the binding term @xmath30 and the unbinding term @xmath31 would be equal , i.e.@xmath32 for simplicity , we assume that the boundary densities at the left boundary , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , fulfill this adsorption equilibrium condition ( [ adsorpequil ] ) .",
    "in addition to studying equations ( [ netcurrent ] ) and ( [ kirchhoff ] ) by analytical approximations , we use monte carlo simulations of lattice models as in @xcite to obtain the stationary density and current profiles . in the simulations ,",
    "the motors are represented by random walkers on a cubic lattice with lattice constant @xmath35 , see figure [ figlatticemodel](b ) .",
    "a line of lattice sites represents the filament .",
    "motors at the filament sites perform a biased random walk , while motors at non - filament sites perform symmetric random walks .",
    "the jump probabilities per unit time @xmath36 are @xmath10 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 for a forward , a backward and no step at filament sites , respectively , and @xmath11 for steps to each neighbour site at non - filament sites . in the following , we use @xmath39 for simplicity .",
    "unbinding from the filament occurs with probability @xmath13 to each adjacent non - filament site , and unbound motors which reach the filament bind to it with probability @xmath12 .",
    "exclusion is implemented by rejecting all hopping attempts to sites which are already occupied by another motor .",
    "the hopping rates of the lattice models are matched to the transport properties of the motors via @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , see @xcite and the appendix c in @xcite .",
    "and ( b ) current densities @xmath44 for different boundary densities @xmath6 as obtained from monte carlo simulation ( @xmath45 ) and from the adsorption equilibrium approximation ( solid lines ) .",
    "the parameters are @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49.,width=491 ]    when the motors on the filament move to the right , i.e.for @xmath50 , they jam up at the closed right end until the tube far from the left boundary is completely filled with motors . in the bulk of a long tube , one thus has bound and unbound motor densities @xmath51 and @xmath52",
    ". indeed , these density values are a fixed point of equations ( [ netcurrent ] ) and ( [ kirchhoff ] ) . within a boundary region at the left end ,",
    "the densities cross over to the boundary values @xmath33 and @xmath34 .    likewise , if the motors on the filament move to the left , i.e.for @xmath53 , they are driven out of the tube at the left end , so that the bulk is left empty with @xmath54 and @xmath55 , which is another fixed point of equations ( [ netcurrent ] ) and ( [ kirchhoff ] ) . however , a boundary region at the left end survives , fed by ingoing diffusion .",
    "typical motor density profiles for this case are shown in figure [ figprofilescurrents](a ) .",
    "they display a `` jam '' region at the left end , separated from the `` empty '' bulk region by a localized domain wall or shock .",
    "the system is thus characterized by two length scales : the bulk length scale @xmath56 on which the densities approach their the bulk values and which is independent of the boundary densities , and the jam length @xmath57 which describes the width of the jammed boundary region and which , of course , strongly depends on the boundary densities .",
    "on tuning the motor velocity @xmath8 , the system displays two phases , a high and a low density phase , which are dominated by the closed right end .",
    "taking the bulk density as order parameter , one has a phase transition at @xmath58 .",
    "as will be shown both in analytical approximation and in monte carlo simulation , both characteristic length scales @xmath56 and @xmath57 diverge with the power law @xmath59 as the motor velocity @xmath8 approaches zero .    in an experiment , this limit can easily be realized by reducing the concentration [ atp ] of the motor fuel atp , since for small [ atp ] , @xmath60 [ atp ] .",
    "changing the sign of @xmath8 is much more difficult , one possibility is to use motor particles driven by motors of two species with opposite directionality , so that one could invert the movement by activating one motor species while deactivating the other .",
    "if these motor particles switch stochastically between the two directions , one could change the sign of their average velocity by influencing the switching rates through regulatory molecules .",
    "for example , tau proteins which strongly suppress movements towards the synapse in axons can induce the retreat of vesicles into the cell body @xcite .    for @xmath58 ,",
    "i.e.  when there is no active motion of the motors , the system is in thermodynamic equilibrium , and the adsorption equilibrium as described by equation ( [ adsorpequil ] ) is valid for all @xmath14 along the filament .",
    "thus the bulk densities are @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "this case is the only one where the bulk values are dominated by the open left filament end . a phase diagram is shown in figure [ figphasediag ] , the control parameters are the motor velocity @xmath8 and the left boundary density @xmath6 .    , the system is essentially empty with bulk density @xmath54 , while for motors moving to the right , i.e.  @xmath50 , it is essentially full with bulk density @xmath63 . at the phase transition @xmath58 ,",
