    "the two definition are connected by a gauge transformation @xmath14 and the limit , namely @xmath15 the non - holomorphic partition function @xmath16 has a good global properties .",
    "the @xmath17 dependence is governed by the holomorphic anomaly equation which is written down by bershadsky , cecotti , ooguri and vafa @xcite .",
