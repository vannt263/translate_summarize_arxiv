    "the standard model ( sm ) is very economical in the sense that the higgs doublet responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking can also be used to generate fermion masses .",
    "the higgs boson couplings to the gauge bosons , quarks , and leptons are therefore predicted in the standard model , where one expects the higgs boson to decay mostly to b - jets and tau pairs ( for low higgs masses , @xmath4 gev ) , or to @xmath5 or @xmath6 pairs , ( for higher higgs masses , @xmath7 gev ) . since the higgs boson is neutral and does not couple to photons at tree level , the branching ratio @xmath8 is predicted to be very small in the sm , on the order of @xmath9 .    in a more general framework , however , where different sectors of the theory are responsible for the physics of flavor and electroweak symmetry breaking , one may expect deviations from the sm predictions , which may lead to drastic changes in the higgs boson discovery signatures .",
    "one such example is the so called `` fermiophobic '' ( also known as `` bosophilic '' or `` bosonic '' ) higgs , which has suppressed couplings to all fermions .",
    "it may arise in a variety of models , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "a variation on this theme is the higgs in certain topcolor models , which may couple to heavy quarks only @xcite .",
    "some even more exotic possibilities have been suggested in the context of theories with large extra dimensions @xcite . finally , in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , the width into @xmath10 pairs can be suppressed due to 1-loop susy corrections , thus enhancing the branching ratios of a light higgs into more exotic signatures @xcite . in all these cases",
    ", the higgs boson decays to photon pairs are mediated through a @xmath11 or heavy quark loop and dominate for @xmath12 gev @xcite . in the range @xmath13 , they compete with the @xmath14 mode , while for @xmath15 gev , @xmath16 completely takes over .",
    "current bounds from lep @xcite are limited by the kinematic reach of the machine .",
    "the existing run i analyses at the tevatron have utilized the diphoton plus 2 jets @xcite and inclusive diphoton @xcite channels and were limited by statistics .",
    "since they only looked for a `` bosonic '' higgs @xcite , they did not consider the higgs production mechanism through gluon fusion , which can be a major additional source of signal in certain models @xcite .",
    "since @xmath17 is a very clean signature , it will allow the tevatron to extend significantly those limits in its next run .",
    "in this study we shall evaluate the higgs discovery potential of the upcoming tevatron runs for several diphoton channels .",
    "we shall concentrate on the following two questions .",
    "first , what is the absolute reach in higgs mass as a function of the @xmath3 branching ratio ?",
    "second , which signature ( inclusive diphotons , diphotons plus one jet , or diphotons plus two jets ) provides the best reach .",
    "we believe that neither of those two questions has been adequately addressed in the literature previously .",
    "here we consider the case of a `` bosonic '' higgs , i.e. models where the higgs couplings to all fermions are suppressed . then , the main higgs production modes at the tevatron are associated @xmath18 production , as well as @xmath19 fusion .",
    "all of these processes have comparable rates @xcite , so it makes sense to consider an inclusive signature first @xcite .",
    "we use the following cuts for our inclusive study : two photons with @xmath20 gev and rapidity @xmath21 , motivated by the acceptance of the cdf or d  detectors in run ii .",
    "triggering on such a signature is trivial ; both collaborations will have diphoton triggers that are nearly fully efficient with such offline cuts .",
    "we assume 80% diphoton identification efficiency , which we apply to both the signal and background estimates on top of the kinematic and geometrical acceptance . again",
    ", this efficiency is motivated by the cdf / d  em i d efficiency in run i and is not likely to change in run ii .",
    "the main backgrounds to the inclusive diphoton channel come from the qcd production of dijets , direct photons , and diphotons . in the former two cases",
    "a jet mimics a photon by fragmenting into a leading @xmath22 meson that further decays into a pair of photons , not resolved in the calorimeter .",
    "= 3.5 in    we used the pythia  @xcite event generator and the experimentally measured probability of a jet to fake a photon  @xcite to calculate all three components of the qcd background .",
    "the faking probability depends significantly on the particular photon i d cuts , especially on the photon isolation requirement  ( see , e.g. @xcite ) . for this study we used an @xmath23-dependent jet - faking - photon probability of @xmath24 which is obtained by taking the @xmath25-averaged faking probabilities used in the d  run i searches  @xcite . the fractional error on @xmath26 is about 25% and is dominated by the uncertainty on the direct photon fraction in the @xmath27 sample used for its determination .",
    "( for high photon @xmath23 , however , the error is dominated by the available statistics . )",
    "this probability is expected to remain approximately the same in run ii for both the cdf and d  detectors .",
    "we used 80% i d efficiency for the pair of photons , and required the photons to be isolated from possible extra jets in the event .",
    "we accounted for nlo corrections via a constant @xmath28-factor of 1.34 .",
    "= 3.5 in    adding all background contributions , for the total background in the inclusive diphoton channel we obtain the following parametrization : @xmath29\\ \\exp\\,\\biggl\\ { p_1 +      p_2 \\left ( { m_{\\gamma\\gamma}\\over 1\\ { \\rm gev}}\\right)\\biggr\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 . in the region @xmath35 gev it is dominated by direct diphoton production and hence is irreducible .",
    "the expected statistical plus systematic error on this background determination is at the level of 25% , based on the jet - faking photon probability uncertainty . for larger invariant masses , however , the accuracy is dominated by the uncertainties in the direct diphoton production cross section , which will be difficult to measure independently in run ii , so one will still have to rely on the nlo predictions . on the other hand , for narrow resonance searches one could do self - calibration of the background by calculating the expected background under the signal peak via interpolation of the measured diphoton mass spectrum between the regions just below and just above the assumed resonance mass .",
    "therefore , in our case the background error will be purely dominated by the background statistics . a combination of the interpolation tecnique and the shape information from the theoretical nlo calculations of the direct diphoton cross section is expected to result in significantly smaller background error in run ii .    the total background , as well as the individual contributions from @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 production , are shown in fig .",
    "[ qcd_background ] .",
    "additional sm background sources to the inclusive diphoton channel include drell - yan production with both electrons misidentified as photons , @xmath39 production , etc . and are all negligible compared to the qcd background .",
    "the absolute normalization of the background obtained by the above method agrees well with the actual background measured by cdf and d  in the diphoton mode  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ ggx ] we show the 95% cl upper limit on the differential cross section after cuts @xmath40 as a function of the diphoton invariant mass @xmath41 , given the above background prediction ( here @xmath42 is the product of the acceptance and all efficiencies ) .",
    "this limit represents @xmath43 sensitivity to a narrow signal when doing a counting experiment in 1 gev diphoton mass bins .",
    "this plot can be used to obtain the sensitivity to any resonance decaying into two photons as follows .",
    "one first fixes the width of the mass window around the signal peak which is used in the analysis .",
    "then one takes the average value of the 95% c.l . limit in @xmath44 across the mass window from fig .",
    "[ ggx ] and multiplies it by @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the width of the mass window power .",
    "] , to obtain the corresponding 95% cl upper limit on the signal cross - section after cuts .",
    "similar scaling could be used if one is interested in the 3@xmath47 or 5@xmath47 reach .",
    "= 2.5 in    when searching for narrow resonances in the presence of large backgrounds ( @xmath48 ) , the best sensitivity toward signal ( @xmath49 ) is achieved by performing an unbinned maximum likelihood fit to the sum of the expected signal and background shapes .",
    "however , simple counting experiments give similar sensitivity if the size of the signal `` window '' is optimized . for narrow resonances",
    "the observed width away from the peak is a factor of 2 smaller than the peak value ( fwhm ) . for a gaussian resonance the width",
    "is related to the variance @xmath47 by @xmath50 . ]",
    "@xmath51 is dominated by the instrumental effects , and is often gaussian .",
    "the background in a narrow window centered on the assumed position @xmath52 of the peak in the signal invariant mass distribution could be treated as linear .",
    "therefore , the gaussian significance of the signal , @xmath53 , as a function of the window width , @xmath46 , is given by : @xmath54 where erf@xmath55 is the error function @xmath56 the function ( [ signgaus ] ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : significance ] , and has a maximum at @xmath57 , which corresponds to @xmath58 cut around the resonance maximum .    for resonances significantly wider than the experimental resoluton , the shape is given by the breit - wigner function , and in this case the significance is : @xmath59 this function , also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : significance ] , peaks at a similar value of @xmath46 ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "we see that for both gaussian and breit - wigner resonances , the significance does not appreciably change when using a @xmath61 cuts . for our analysis",
    "we shall use two representative choices : @xmath62 and @xmath63 for the mass window , which we shall always center on the actual higgs mass .",
    "clearly , one can do even better in principle , by suitably resizing and repositioning the mass window around the bump in the combined @xmath64 distribution . because of the steeply falling parton luminosities , the signal mass peak is skewed and its maximum will appear somewhat below the actual physical mass . in our analysis we choose not to take advantage of these slight improvements , thus accounting for unknown systematics .      in tables",
    "[ 1sigma ] and [ 2sigma ] we show the inclusive @xmath65 background rates in fb for different higgs masses , for @xmath62 and @xmath66 mass window cuts , respectively .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     = 2.5 in    in fig .",
    "[ topcolor ] we show the run ii reach for the branching ratio @xmath8 as a function of the higgs mass , for the case of a `` topcolor '' higgs boson .",
    "this time the channels with the best signal - to - noise ratio are : o : inclusive @xmath67 , and @xmath68 : @xmath69 , with @xmath70 gev ; both with @xmath62 .",
    "we have studied the tevatron reach for higgs bosons decaying into photon pairs . for purely `` bosonic '' higgses , which only couple to gauge bosons",
    ", the @xmath71 channel offers the best reach , but the @xmath69 channel is almost as good . for topcolor higgs bosons , which can also be produced via gluon fusion , the inclusive @xmath67 channel is the best , but the @xmath69 channel is again very competitive .",
    "we see that in both cases the @xmath69 channel is a no - lose option !",
