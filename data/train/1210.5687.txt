    "the behavior of a real variety at its complex points is not relevant , but in this paper it is crucial to consider complex points as well .",

    "* thm.1.1 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* thm.0.1 ) .",
    "if @xmath18 is orientable , there can be further obstructions involving @xmath391 .",
    "for instance , let @xmath392 be a very general k3 surface . by the noether  lefschetz theorem , the picard group of @xmath393 is generated by the hyperplane class .",
    "if @xmath18 is contained in @xmath394 then the restriction of @xmath395 to @xmath18 is trivial , thus only null - homotopic curves can be approximated by algebraic curves .",
    "note also that if @xmath18 is a real k3 surface , then by @xcite , there is a totally algebraic real k3 surface real deformation equivalent to @xmath18 ( at least if @xmath18 is a non - maximal surface ) thus in general there is no purely topological obstruction to approximability for real k3 surfaces .",
    "geometrically rational surface contain many rational curves , so approximation by real - smooth rational curves could be possible .",
    "any geometrically rational surface is totally algebraic but there are not enough automorphisms to approximate all diffeomorphisms , at least if the number of connected components is greater than 2 ; see  @xcite .",
    "another obstruction arises from the genus formula .",
    "for example , let @xmath18 be a degree  @xmath396 del pezzo surface with picard number @xmath397 and @xmath27 a curve on it",
    ". then @xmath398 for some positive integer @xmath204 and so @xmath399 is divisible by @xmath400 .",
