    "possessing two higgs doublets is one of the characteristics of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) in order to give masses to the up - quark sector and the down - quark sector separately [ 1 ] .",
    "this property enables in principle cp violation to occur in the higgs sector of the mssm through the mixing between the cp even and the cp odd states [ 2 ] .",
    "the mechanism of cp violation in the mssm has been studied by many authors [ 3 - 12 ] .",
    "it is found that at the tree level , neither explicit nor spontaneous cp violation is possible in the higgs sector of the mssm , because any complex phases in it can always be eliminated by rotating the higgs fields . even at the one - loop level ,",
    "spontaneous cp violation is disfavored because it requires a very light neutral higgs boson , which has already been ruled out by experiments [ 3,4 ] . on the other hand ,",
    "explicit cp violation is viable in the mssm at the one - loop level by virtue of the radiative corrections due to the loops of relevant particles , such as quarks and squarks [ 5 - 12 ] .",
    "the radiative corrections by these particles yield the mixing between the cp even and the cp odd neutral higgs bosons .",
    "thus , it is possible to achieve the explicit cp violation in the radiatively corrected higgs sector of the mssm .    however , a drawback of the mssm is that it contains a higgs mixing term @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a parameter having mass dimension , and @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) are higgs doublets .",
    "it is known that this @xmath2 parameter causes a hierarchy problem with respect to the symmetry breaking scale [ 13 ] . a natural framework to solve",
    "this problem is to generate the @xmath2 parameter via the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of a higgs singlet [ 14 ] .",
    "a possibility for the framework is to extend simply the higgs sector of the mssm by introducing a higgs singlet , like the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model , where the @xmath2 parameter is practically replaced by a dimensionless parameter times the vev of the higgs singlet [ 14 ] .    a more plausible possibility to solve the @xmath2 problem is to extend not only the higgs sector but also the gauge symmetry of the mssm by introducing a nonanomalous @xmath0 symmetry broken at the tev scale [ 15 ] . extending the gauge symmetry to include an additional @xmath0 symmetry is widely considered in various theoretical models , such as string models or gut models .",
    "the mssm with an extra @xmath0 symmetry can actually forbid the @xmath1 term but allow @xmath5 , by assigning appropriate @xmath0 charges , where @xmath6 is the higgs singlet and @xmath7 is a dimensionless parameter .",
    "after @xmath6 develops a vev of the electroweak scale , this @xmath7 term would effectively generate the @xmath2 term at the electroweak scale [ 16 ] .    in the literature",
    ", a number of studies have been performed on the mssm with an extra @xmath0 symmetry [ 17 - 20 ] .",
    "several authors have calculated the higgs boson masses from the tree - level higgs potential of this model [ 17 ] as well as from the radiatively corrected higgs potential [ 18,19 ] .",
    "it is found that , at the tree level , the lightest scalar higgs boson in this model can be heavier than @xmath8 boson .",
    "that is , the upper bound on the mass of the lightest scalar higgs boson in this model is larger than the one in the mssm without an extra @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "moreover , it is also found that this tree - level mass of the lightest scalar higgs boson in this model can be significantly affected by radiative corrections .",
    "recently , this model has been further investigated within the context of the supersymmetric cp problem [ 20 ] , as it can have explicit cp violating phases in the higgs sector . at the tree level , like the mssm",
    ", this model has no cp mixing between the cp even and the cp odd states in the higgs sector because the single cp phase arising from the tree - level higgs potential can always be eliminated by rotating the higgs fields . in ref . [ 20 ] , the one - loop contribution from the top and stop quark loops are considered in the explicit cp violation scenario .",
    "it is observed that the lightest neutral higgs boson remains essentially cp even for a wide parameter space , with a fixed value of @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the ratio of the vevs of two higgs doublets .",
    "meanwhile , large cp mixtures for the other heavier higgs bosons may be realized as the size of the effective @xmath2 terms becomes large .    in this paper , motivated by the results of ref .",
    "[ 20 ] , we would like to study this model in some detail in the explicit cp violation scenario .",
    "the radiative cp mixing may be generated by means of the complex phases coming from the one - loop effective potential due to top quarks , bottom quarks , the exotic quarks , and their superparticles , where the exotic quarks and squarks with electric charges @xmath11 are introduced into this model in order to cancel gauge anomaly [ 21 ] . in particular , we are interested in the contributions of exotic quark sector in this model . at the one - loop level ,",
    "the exotic quarks and squarks are found to play some recognizable role in the scalar - pseudoscalar mixings .",
    "we find that the relevant cp phase from the exotic quark sector may change the size of the cp mixing between the heaviest scalar and the pseudoscalar higgs bosons by up to 20 % .",
    "also we find that this model yields a negative or extremely small axion mass , as well as other unacceptable predictions , at the one - loop level for full parameter space in the spontaneous cp violation scenario .",
    "thus , we note that the present model is impossible to realize spontaneous cp violation at the one - loop level .",
    "gut , such as the string - inspired @xmath12 model , might be a natural motivation to enlarge the gauge symmetry in order to accommodate an extra @xmath0 symmetry into the mssm .",
    "the @xmath12 gauge group may be decomposed into @xmath13 where @xmath14 is further broken down to the standard model ( sm ) gauge group , @xmath15 . at the electroweak scale",
    ", the desired extra @xmath0 symmetry may be given as an orthogonal linear combination of @xmath16 and @xmath17 as @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 are the @xmath0 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 charges , respectively .",
    "sometimes , for four different values of the angle @xmath22 , the four particular combinations of the @xmath16 and @xmath17 are called as follows : the @xmath23-model for @xmath24 , the @xmath25-model for @xmath26 , the @xmath27-model for @xmath28 , and the @xmath29-model for @xmath30 .",
    "the gauge group we consider is thus @xmath31 .",
    "the higgs sector of the mssm with an extra @xmath0 symmetry consists of two higgs doublets @xmath32 and @xmath33 , and a neutral higgs singlet @xmath6 .",
    "this model possesses an extra pair of @xmath34 singlet quarks , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , with electric charges @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively , introduced by the requirement of the gauge anomaly cancellation . for the fermion matter fields in this model ,",
    "we take into account only the third generation of quarks , besides the exotic quarks .",
    "then , the superpotential for the model we consider may be expressed as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the left - handed quark doublet , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the charge conjugate of the right - handed top quark and bottom quark , respectively , with @xmath43 and @xmath44 being their respective yukawa coupling coefficients , and @xmath45 .",
    "all the coupling coefficients are dimensionless .",
    "this superpotential is symmetric under @xmath46 , and the @xmath0 symmetry is broken down by the vev of @xmath6 .",
    "the higgs potential of this model at the tree level may expressed as a sum of the @xmath47-term , the @xmath48-term , and the soft breaking term , that is , @xmath49 where @xmath50   \\ , \\cr v_d & = & { g_2 ^ 2 \\over 8 } ( h_1^{\\dagger } \\vec\\sigma h_1 + h_2^{\\dagger } \\vec\\sigma h_2)^2 + { g_1 ^ 2 \\over 8 } ( |h_1|^2 - |h_2|^2)^2 \\cr & & \\mbox{}+ { g^{'2}_1 \\over 2 } ( { \\tilde q}_1 |h_1|^2 + { \\tilde q}_2 |h_2|^2 + { \\tilde q}_3 |s|^2)^2 \\ ,",

    "therefore , the cp symmetry is not violated in this model at the tree level .",
    "now let us consider the one - loop radiative corrections to the tree - level higgs potential . in supersymmetric models ,",
    "the incomplete cancellation between ordinary particles and their superpartners yield the one - loop corrections to the tree - level higgs boson masses .",
    "generally , the most dominant part of the one - loop corrections to the tree - level higgs potential come primarily from the top and stop quark loops . by considering the top quark sector only",
    ", it has been observed that explicit cp violation in this model is viable through the radiatively corrected higgs potential [ 20 ] . for large @xmath72",
    ", the contribution of the bottom and sbottom quark loops can also be significantly large .",
    "we would like to consider in this paper the one - loop contributions from both the top and bottom quark sector , as well as from the exotic quark sector .    to start with",
    ", we calculate the tree - level masses of the relevant particles in order to evaluate the radiative corrections to the neutral higgs sector .",
    "the fermion matter fields obtain their masses after the electroweak symmetry breaking as @xmath73 for top quark , @xmath74 for bottom quark , and @xmath75 for the exotic quark .",
    "the tree - level masses of their superpartners are given as @xmath76 where @xmath77 , @xmath78 .",
    "further , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 are the soft susy breaking masses respectively for stop quarks , sbottom quarks , and the exotic squarks , and likewise @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 are respectively their trilinear soft susy breaking parameters of the mass dimension .",
    "one can notice that there are three phases @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 in the above expressions .",
    "these complex phases are determined by the generally complex @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) and the phase of @xmath90 , the vev of the higgs singlet .",
    "we note that the @xmath48-terms do not contribute to the squark masses .",
    "the full higgs potential at the one - loop level may be written as @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the radiative corrections due to the relevant particles and their superpartners . according to the effective potential method [ 22 ] , @xmath92 is given as @xmath93   \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath94 is the renormalization scale in the modified minimal subtraction scheme , and the subscript @xmath95 stands for various participating particles : @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "the degrees of freedom for these particles including the sign convention are @xmath105 and @xmath106 ( @xmath4 ) , since in the above formula enter fermions with a negative sign while bosons with a positive sign .",
    "if cp violation takes place in the higgs sector , the neutral higgs bosons would not have definite cp parity , hence mixings among them . in case of explicit cp violation ,",

    "note that @xmath110 is generally nonzero at the one - loop level whereas at the tree level it can be made zero by rotating the higgs singlet . in the above tadpole minimum condition",
    ", the first term comes from the tree - level higgs potential , and the remaining three terms come respectively from the top squark , bottom squark , and exotic squark contributions .    at the tree level ,",
    "the higgs sector in the mssm with an extra @xmath0 has ten real degrees of freedom , which are decomposed by two neutral goldstone bosons , a pair of charged goldstone bosons , four neutral higgs bosons and a pair of charged higgs bosons . after the electroweak symmetry breaking",
    ", the two neutral goldstone bosons and a pair of charged goldstone bosons will eventually be absorbed into the longitudinal component of @xmath8 , @xmath113 , and @xmath114 gauge bosons .",
    "since the cp symmetry is conserved in the higgs sector at the tree level , the four neutral higgs bosons can be divided into three scalar higgs bosons and one pseudoscalar higgs boson , according to the cp parity .",
    "the squared mass matrix @xmath115 of the four neutral higgs bosons is given as a symmetric @xmath116 matrix that is obtained by the second derivatives of the higgs potential with respect to the four higgs fields , in the ( @xmath117 ) basis .",
    "at the tree level , @xmath115 is given by @xmath118 as @xmath119 where the tree - level squared mass of the pseudoscalar higgs boson is given as @xmath120 with @xmath121 standing for the splitting between an extra @xmath0 symmetry breaking scale and the electroweak scale .",
    "note that @xmath122 is divided into two blocks of the upper - left @xmath123 submatrix and the single element @xmath124 , corresponding to the scalar part and the pseudoscalar part .",

    "therefore , @xmath129 contains not only the tree - level results but also the contributions from radiative corrections .",
    "now , let us calculate @xmath133 , which is obtained from @xmath92 .",
    "we may conveniently decompose @xmath133 as @xmath134 where symmetric matrices @xmath135 , @xmath136 , and @xmath137 are obtained respectively from the top quark sector , the bottom quark sector , and the exotic quark sector contributions to @xmath92 , after imposing the tadpole minimum condition .",
    "somewhat lengthy calculations yield the matrix elements of @xmath135 as @xmath138 where @xmath139 and the dimensionless function @xmath140 is defined as @xmath141    likewise , the matrix elements of @xmath136 as @xmath142 where @xmath143 and the matrix elements of @xmath137 as @xmath144 where @xmath145    notice that the matrix elements @xmath146 , @xmath147 , and @xmath148 ( @xmath126 ) are proportional to @xmath149 , @xmath150 , and @xmath151 , respectively .",
    "if the three cp phases are not all zero , these matrix elements would not be all zero , and therefore the matrix elements @xmath152 ( @xmath126 ) would not be zero , which are responsible for the scalar - psuedoscalar mixing and hence cp violation .",
    "in short , these three cp phases in the radiative corrections generate the cp mixing between the scalar and pseudoscalar components , implying that the four neutral higgs bosons are not states of definite cp parity .",
    "the four physical neutral higgs bosons at the one - loop level are defined as the eigenstates of the squared mass matrix @xmath115 , with their squared masses as the eigenvalues of @xmath115 .",
    "let us denote the physical four neutral higgs bosons as @xmath153 ( @xmath52= 1 to 4 ) and their squared masses as @xmath154 ( @xmath52 = 1 to 4 ) .",

    "we assume that the lighter squarks are larger than top quark mass . for the remaining parameters",
    ", we set the ranges for their variations as follows : @xmath168 , @xmath169 , @xmath170 , @xmath171 , @xmath172 , and @xmath173 .",
    "note that one need not vary @xmath110 since it appears always together with @xmath174 in the definition of @xmath175 .",
    "also note that the upper bound on @xmath7 is chosen by considering that the the maximum value of @xmath7 is about 0.83 in the analysis of the renormalization group equation . a general comment on @xmath90",
    "may be that a large @xmath90 leads to a heavy @xmath113 in the present model .",
    "moreover , the large @xmath90 can satisfy the experimental constraint that the mixing angle between @xmath8 and @xmath113 should be smaller than 2 - 3 @xmath176 .",

    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "1 , where the upper bound on @xmath177 is plotted as a function of @xmath72 , the solid curve is obtained by considering only the tree - level higgs potential , whereas the dashed curve is obtained by considering the full one - loop higgs potential with explicit cp violation .",
    "it is observed in the mssm that the lightest neutral higgs boson mass increases steadily as @xmath72 increases . in the present model , where the mssm is incorporated with an extra @xmath0 ,",
    "the lightest neutral higgs boson mass does not increase in accordance with the increase of @xmath72 , because of both the higgs singlet and @xmath179 contributions due to an extra @xmath0 .",
    "one can see that in fig .",
    "1 the lightest neutral higgs boson mass becomes maximum at @xmath180 for both curves .    as we have remarked in the previous section , the scalar - pseudoscalar mixing , which is responsible for cp violation in this model ,",
    "is triggered by three cp phases , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 .",
    "the size of the cp mixing between the scalar and pseudoscalar higgs bosons could be regarded as maximal if @xmath181 = 1 , while there would be no cp mixing if @xmath181 = 0 . in order to see a more clear picture about the amount of the cp mixing among the scalar and pseudoscalar higgs bosons , we introduce ( @xmath52 = 1,2,3 ) @xmath182 which depend implicitly on other parameters as well .",

    "2 . unlike @xmath186",
    ", they do not fluctuate widely against the variation of @xmath87 .",
    "thus , it can be said that the complex phase of the exotic quark sector has a strong influence on the magnitude of the mixing between @xmath204 and @xmath205 , whereas it has relatively weak influence on the magnitudes of the mixing between @xmath206 and @xmath205 or between @xmath207 and @xmath205 .",
    "we calculate the masses of the neutral higgs bosons for the same parameter setting as in fig . 2 : @xmath187 gev , @xmath188 , together with four different sets of @xmath189 and @xmath72 , for @xmath203 .",

    "we have studied the dependence of the mixing element between @xmath204 and @xmath205 on the complex phase of the exotic quark sector .",
    "meanwhile , one can evaluate effectively the absolute size of the cp violation by calculating the dimensionless parameter @xmath217 where @xmath218 are the elements of the orthogonal matrix which diagonalizes the squared mass matrix for the neutral higgs bosons .",
    "the range of @xmath219 goes from 0 to 1 since the elements of the orthogonal matrix satisfy the orthogonality condition of @xmath220 .",

    "2 . if @xmath225 remains at 1 , it would imply that @xmath225 does not depend on @xmath87 .",

    "the four curves correspond to the four sets of parameter values .",
    "3 shows that the fluctuation of @xmath225 is larger for @xmath192 than for @xmath191 .",

    "one can see that @xmath225 fluctuates by up to 20 % for nonzero @xmath87 .",
    "since @xmath226 is an absolute measure for the cp violation in our model , it is reasonable to expect that the complex phase of the exotic quark sector may change up to 20 % of the cp violation .",
    "in this section , let us examine briefly whether it is possible to realize the spontaneous cp violation in the present model . at initial stage",
    ", the lagrangian density of the model is assumed to be invariant with respect to cp property .",
    "after the electroweak symmetry breaking , the cp symmetry may spontaneously be broken by complex phases in the vevs of the neutral higgs fields . in the mssm with an extra @xmath0",
    ", one can conjecture from the georgi - pais theorem that the spontaneous cp violation leads to a very light pseudoscalar higgs boson , namely , the axion .",
    "it has been addressed that the spontaneous cp violation through radiative corrections can be realized when at the tree level there exist massless higgs bosons other than goldstone boson [ 23 ] . in the present model , there is no pseudo - glodstone boson , which is referred to as axion , and thus the spontaneous cp violation can not occur at the one - loop level .    in order to examine the possibility of spontaneous cp violation scenario at the one - loop level",
    ", we can quantitatively analyze the axion mass by using the formulae which are derived for explicit cp violation scenario .",
    "in spontaneous cp violation scenario , the one - loop effective potential of the present model may have only one physical cp phase ( @xmath67 ) arising from the vev of the higgs singlet by considering the radiative corrections due to top quark , bottom quark , the exotic quark , and their superpartners . at the one - loop level , we obtain the minimum condition for the vacuum with respect to @xmath67 as @xmath227 for @xmath228 .",

    "the squared mass of axion is almost always negative for the entire parameter space , which is unacceptable .",
    "therefore , the spontaneous cp violation is not viable for the mssm with an extra @xmath0 .",

    "in fact , the minimum condition for the vacuum with respect to @xmath67 has a very strong constraint , and thus the vacuum becomes unstable for the full parameter space we consider , in the spontaneous cp violation scenario .",

    "the charge of the extra @xmath0 is defined as @xmath230 with @xmath231 .",
    "this model possesses one higgs singlet and exotic quarks and squarks , in addition to the particle content of the mssm . in this model ,",
    "the cp violation is impossible to occur either explicitly or spontaneously in its the tree - level higgs sector .",
    "the mixing between the scalar and pseudoscalar higgs bosons , which induce the cp violation , may occur via the radiative corrections at the one - loop level .",
    "for the radiative corrections , we consider the loop contributions due to top quark , bottom quark , the exotic quark and their superpartners .",
    "the radiative corrections contain in general three complex phases originated from the top squark sector , the bottom squark sector , and the exotic squark sector .",
    "we pay attention to the complex phase @xmath87 that comes from the exotic squark sector .",
    "we calculate the lightest neutral higgs boson mass . in explicit cp violation scenario",
    ", we find that the mass of the lightest neutral higgs boson is smaller than about 135 gev and 165 gev , respectively , at the tree level and at the one - loop level , for the whole parameter space that we considered .    for four different sets of parameters , we calculate the magnitude of the cp mixing among the scalar and pseudoscalar higgs bosons for @xmath203 .",
    "the matrix element , @xmath200 , representing the cp mixing between the heaviest scalar and the pseudoscalar higgs bosons , is found to depend heavily on the complex phase from the exotic squark sector , @xmath87 . in particular , the magnitude of the cp mixing between the heaviest scalar and the pseudoscalar higgs bosons is found to change as much as about 20 % for @xmath232 when @xmath193 and @xmath192 , whereas the cp mixing among the other scalar higgs bosons and the pseudoscalar higgs boson is found to be relatively stable against the variation of @xmath87 .    also , we have investigated the possibility of spontaneous cp violation at the one - loop level in the neutral higgs sector , where the tree - level higgs potential possesses cp symmetry .",
    "we argue that it is impossible to achieve spontaneous cp violation in the radiatively corrected higgs potential of this model .",
