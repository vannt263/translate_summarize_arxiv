    "the basic structure of our milky way galaxy seems clear : a thin disk of young stars , gas and dust circles the center quietly , immersed within a thicker disk of older stars .",
    "both disks sit inside a nearly spherical halo of very old , metal - poor stars which do not share the overall rotation of the disks . surrounding",
    "everything is an extended distribution of dark matter .",
    "our knowledge of the details within this big picture , on the other hand , is not so clear .",
    "recent large - scale projects , such as the sloan digital sky survey , have measured the properties of high - luminosity stars throughout the halo ( see , for example , @xcite , and @xcite ) , while the rapid development of infrared detectors has allowed projects such as the two micron all sky survey ( @xcite ) and spitzer space telescope ( @xcite ) to pierce the dusty disks and measure the properties of their stars .",
    "nonetheless , some portions of the milky way remain largely unexplored .    in particular , we know little of the low - mass , low - luminosity stars of the halo .",
    "the white dwarfs and metal - poor subdwarfs of the halo glow so faintly , from so great a distance , that they are rarely seen and more rarely recognized . as a recent review ( @xcite ) points out , however , these shy and elusive stars may dominate the microlensing events observed towards the galactic bulge and the magellanic clouds .",
    "there are two ways to search for these stars : cover a very large area on the sky to a shallow depth , or use a `` pencil - beam '' survey to examine a tiny region much more deeply . the first approach ( see , for example , @xcite and @xcite ) will find objects in many directions , but only out to a small distance from the sun ; the second approach ( see , for example , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) probes farther into the halo , but only in a specific direction .",
    "one way to characterize surveys is to combine their area with the distance out to which they would detect some specific star to generate an `` effective volume '' for that type of star . in table",
    "[ table : survey_volume ] , we compare the projects mentioned above by this metric , using a star of absolute magnitude @xmath1 , appropriate for a cool white dwarf .",

    "these images were acquired primarily to study high - redshift galaxies ( @xcite , @xcite ) , but have also been used to find high - redshift supernovae ( @xcite ) .",
    "the images are nearly as deep as those in some hst - based surveys , but cover a significantly wider area , yielding a large effective volume",
    ". we can refer to the sdf catalogs compiled by @xcite and @xcite for information on our candidates in multiple passbands ( @xmath6 , @xmath4 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) .",
    "unlike most other pencil - beam surveys , we have measurements at many epochs : our dataset contains images taken on 20 nights . we can therefore measure the proper motion of our candidates very well , and place strong constraints on the uncertainties in our measurements .",
    "this paper is the first in a series on proper motions in several small fields studied with subaru .",
    "we will concentrate on techniques , leaving detailed analysis of the results for later papers . in section 2",
    ", we describe the observations , their reductions , and the combination of individual frames into a single combined image for each night . in section 3",
    ", we walk through our procedure for finding moving objects , and discuss our criteria for separating good candidates from bogus ones ; we end up with a first sample of stars which have very well measured proper motions . in section 4 ,",
    "we compute the reduced proper motions for objects in this sample , and compare their properties to those of objects drawn from a simulated survey of our field . finally , in section 5 , we list our plans for future work on this dataset , and in other fields with multiple epochs of deep subaru imaging .",
    "astronomers at the observatoire de besanon have created a model of the stellar populations in the milky way ( @xcite ) with a very convenient web - based interface .",
    "the model consists of four populations of stars ",
    "thin disk , thick disk , spheroid , outer bulge ( the innermost portions of the milky way are poorly constrained )  plus white dwarfs added to each component separately .",
    "the parameters of each component are adjusted to produce the best fit to the observed stellar populations and their dynamics .",
    "recent work by @xcite finds that the besanon model does a very good job of reproducing observed star counts in two of three deep fields down to @xmath10 .",
    "those authors criticized the besanon populations for being too sharply defined , forcing them to smooth the model colors by small amounts ( @xmath11 mag ) in order to match observed color - magnitude diagrams .",
    "however , since our main concern is to classify objects very broadly using a mixture of kinematics , magnitudes and colors , we will adopt the besanon model and use it as a reference throughout this paper to help us interpret properties of our sample .",

    ", we followed the procedures described in section 4 of @xcite to turn all the raw frames taken during the night into a single , large mosaic .",
    "briefly , we cleaned the raw images by subtracting a bias deduced from the overscan regions and dividing by a normalized flatfield frame made from a median of many night - time target images .",
    "using the parameters derived in @xcite , we corrected for optical distortions in the focal plane .",
    "images from all chips were convolved to form a uniform point - spread function ( psf ) across the entire array .",
    "we determined a sky background by calculating the local sky at a series of grid points spaced at intervals of roughly @xmath13 arcseconds and using bi - linear interpolation between the grid points ; we then subtracted this sky background from each image .",
    "we used stars shared by adjacent ccds to determine the weights to use when combining data from individual images to make the final mosaic .",
    "the result for each night is one ( or , in the case of 2006 may 3 , two ) large image covering the entire sdf .",
    "the quality of final combined images varied from night to night .",
    "the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) ranged from @xmath14 to @xmath15 , but , since the plate scale was @xmath16 per pixel , no data was undersampled .",
    "the limiting magnitude also varied with the conditions , but was usually @xmath17 .",
    "selecting objects with proper motions from a set of images requires several steps : finding and measuring the properties of stars in individual images , matching stars found at different epochs , computing the change in position of each star over time , and deciding which changes are due to real movement .",
    "we will now describe these steps in detail .    in order to find star - like objects in each image",
    ", we used the `` stars '' program within the _ xvista _ package ( @xcite ) .",
    "the position of each object was calculated by fitting a gaussian to the background - subtracted , intensity - weighted marginal sums in each direction ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "it is not crucial to separate stars from galaxies at this early stage , since we will later discard any objects which do not move significantly ; therefore , we accepted any object with a sharp core , @xmath18 , as a `` star . '' the number of `` stars '' found each night ranged from about 20,000 to about 100,000 , depending on the exposure time and seeing .",
    "the suprime - cam field is wide enough that even small uncorrected distortions near the edge of the field might move the apparent position of a star enough from one epoch to the next to hide real , but small , proper motions . in order to reduce any residual distortions",
    ", we broke the field into smaller units we will call `` sectors . ''",
    "each sector is a square @xmath19 pixels , or @xmath20 arcseconds , on a side .",
    "we allowed a small overlap of @xmath21 arcseconds between adjacent sectors so that stars near the edges would not be missed .",
    "we designated one epoch , 2007 february 15 , as `` fiducial , '' to serve as the basis of our matching procedure .",
    "for every other image , we used the _ match _ package ( @xcite ) to match the objects in each sector to objects in the corresponding sector of the fiducial image . in order to count as an initial match to the fiducial image ,",
    "a star had to lie within @xmath22 of the position of an object in the fiducial frame ; we imposed this limit in order to avoid spurious matches between unrelated objects .",
    "given the six - year span of our survey , this places an upper limit of about @xmath23 per year on our proper motion candidates .",
    "we may increase this limit to look for fast - moving objects in the future .",
    "we will demonstrate later ( see figure [ fig : pm_histogram ] ) that this requirement does not have a strong effect on the results .",
    "there were typically three hundred to eight hundred pairs of matching items found within each sector .",
    "we transformed the ( pixel ) coordinates of each star to the ( pixel ) coordinates of the fiducial image in the following iterative manner .",
    "first , we used all the matched pairs in the sector to find the coefficients of a linear transformation @xmath24 via a least - squares technique .",
    "next , we computed the residuals between the positions of the members of each pair in the fiducial coordinate system .",
    "we discarded pairs with large residuals ; specifically , any pair with a residual more than 10 times the 35th percentile .",
    "we then went back to compute new coefficients of the linear transformation with the surviving pairs .",
    "we repeated this procedure three times in each sector . ignoring a few sectors with very few objects , the mean residual difference in position for surviving items matched to the fiducial frame was @xmath25 .",
    "however , most of the objects contributing to this residual , like most of the objects in each image , are faint , and some of the matches are spurious .",
    "the uncertainties in the positions of bright objects are considerably smaller , as we will show below .",
    "we performed trials using a cubic transformation between the two coordinate systems , but found that the residuals were not significantly smaller than those based on a linear transformation .",
    "the final steps in our matching procedure were to discard duplicate entries for objects in the overlapping areas between sectors , and to discard any objects which appeared in fewer than five epochs .",
    "the result was a set of positions in the fiducial coordinate system for objects appearing in at least five epochs . in order to estimate the uncertainty in the calculated positions , we computed the mean position of each objects in each coordinate ( row and col ) and its standard deviation ; we then discarded measurements more than two standard deviations from the mean and recalculated mean and standard deviation . as shown in the first two rows of table [ table : pos_uncert ] , the typical clipped standard deviation rose from @xmath26 for bright , unsaturated objects to @xmath27 for faint objects .",

    ", we drew 15 epochs randomly from our list of observations ( see table [ table : journal ] ) , and computed a set of positions , using the true proper motion plus some random error in each direction drawn from a gaussian distribution consistent with our measurements of @xmath41 for the given magnitude .",
    "we then submitted this list of simulated positions to our fitting routines , and compared their results to the true proper motions .",
    "we found that over this entire range of magnitudes and motions , our estimates for the proper motion and its uncertainty were accurate .",
    "next , we computed a significance of the slope for each coordinate :    @xmath44    choosing objects based on the significance of their motion in one direction alone would discriminate against objects moving diagonally across the ccd , which was aligned with the equatorial coordinate system .",
    "therefore , we combined the significance values to create an unbiased measure of motion , @xmath45 .",
    "we expect that real proper motions should show an asymmetry , due to the relative motions around the galactic center of the sun and the stars in the sdf , while spurious motions due to random errors in position measurements should be the same in all directions . in the upper panel of figure [ fig :",
    "significance ] , we plot the observed motions of objects with motions of low significance ; they are distributed around zero with circular symmetry . on the other hand , objects with highly significant motions ( shown in the lower panel of figure [ fig : significance ] ) are biased towards the south - east . the observed asymmetry matches that of the stars in a simulation made with the besanon model ( the motions of which we have scaled appropriately ) .",

''",
    "selecting objects based on the @xmath48 statistic introduces a bias against objects with small proper motions .",
    "we investigated the nature of this bias by adding artificial stars with a range of proper motions into our images , analyzing the images as before , and comparing the output properties of the artificial stars to their input values . in figure",
    "[ fig : moving_signif ] , we show the fraction of artificial stars which had measured motions of high enough significance to be included in our proper motion sample . for bright stars ,",
    "the fraction drops to 50% at a total proper motion of about @xmath49 per year .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)moving_completeness_b.eps    we found that 110 objects passed this test .",
    "however , upon visually inspecting each candidate , we discovered that in five cases , the motions were due to a blend of two nearby stars , or a star mixed with the light of a background galaxy . that left a set of 105 candidates with real motions at a high significance .",
    "the median number of epochs of measurement for these objects was 19 , and only 2 stars had fewer than 15 epochs .",

    "@xmath51 we included a constant @xmath52 per year to prevent division by zero .",
    "figure [ fig : fractional_errors ] shows the median value of @xmath50 as a function of input proper motion for stars of different magnitudes .",
    "the fractional error reaches 10% for proper motions of about @xmath49 per year .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)moving_completeness_d.eps    let us turn back to the real stars in the sdf .",
    "figure [ fig : pm_histogram ] shows that the distribution of proper motions among stars in our sample has a peak at @xmath49 per year , which is ( not coincidentally ) the point at which the efficiency of detecting motion falls to 50% .",
    "the largest motions we found are about @xmath53 per year , which is far less than the limit of @xmath23 per year set by our matching procedure .",
    "we conclude that our matching requirement  that each measurement lie within @xmath22 of its match in the fiducial epoch  does not have a strong effect on the resulting proper motions .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)pm_histogram.eps    some of the analysis described below requires the color of an object , in order to distinguish different types of star .",
    "we chose the @xmath54 color for several reasons : it samples a wide range of wavelengths , avoids @xmath6-band measurements which are hard to make for cool stars , is often used in studies of galactic structure , and is commonly tabulated in models of stellar properties . since we used @xmath8-band images to search for motions , all the candidates had good @xmath8-band magnitudes ; we will convert them to the standard cousins @xmath55 system in the next paragraph .",

    "wds with atmospheres dominated by other elements , such as helium or carbon , would continue to grow redder as they cool .",

    "the pm candidates falling into the wd region are concentrated near the red edge of the region , just as models of wd cooling predict .",
    "we take the combined results for ten simulated catalogs generated from the besanon model , correct for completeness as a function of magnitude and proper motion , based on our tests with artificial stars ( see figure [ fig : moving_signif ] ) , and divide by 10 to find predictions of @xmath81 wds in the halo , @xmath82 in the thick disk and @xmath83 in the thin disk , for a total of @xmath84 wds satisfying our selection criteria in the sdf .",
    "our sample yields 9 candidates in this region , consistent with the model .",
    "note that several candidates lie just outside the wd region ; we must make additional measurements of these objects before we can make any confident claim about the exact number of wds . which of our candidates are most likely to be members of the halo ?",
    "as a young wd cools , it slides diagonally down and to the right on this diagram , parallel to the lower envelope of the simulation s objects . due to their high velocities , halo wds should lie near the bottom of the distribution .",
    "there are several candidates at some distance below the main locus of simulation objects ; we believe the two at @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the most likely of our candidates to be halo dwars .",
    "roughly one - quarter of our pm candidates lie in an `` empty '' region between the simulation s wd and halo stars .",
    "since we drew the boundaries by hand , they may certainly be shifted by small amounts ; that would cause a number of the anamolous objects to fall within the halo or wd regions . however , some of our candidates are more than one magnitude away from any population in the simulations .",
    "is it possible that they may be ordinary stars reddened by dust ?",
    "according to @xcite , dust along the line of sight through the sdf should produce @xmath87 mag ; the corresponding extinction , @xmath88 and @xmath89 , is too small to shift candidates a significant distance in the reduced pm diagram .",
    "we suggest that these objects may be metal - poor subdwarfs in the halo , a class of star which is not included in the besanon model .",
    "if we make an hr diagram using @xmath90 and @xmath54 , we find that the halo stars in the besanon model cross the disk main sequence in the range @xmath91 , and are slightly more luminous in the redder portion of this range .",
    "however , as @xcite show , extremely metal - poor subdwarfs are much fainter than disk stars in this color range , by up to 4 magnitudes .",
    "stars with these photometric properties and halo kinematics would lie several magnitudes below the halo region drawn in our diagrams .",
    "we therefore tentatively identify as extremely metal - poor halo stars the pm candidates which fall far from the wd and halo regions .",
    "our first step will be to acquire spectra of some of our pm candidates to verify their identity as wds and metal - poor subdwarfs .",
    "after we have spectra for a good fraction of our candidates , we can assign types to the candidates with more confidence . at that point",
    ", we will make a more detailed and quantitative comparison of the wds in our sample with those expected from models of the milky way .",
    "we can also look at candidates with motions of somewhat lower significance . in this paper , we examined the 110 stars which had @xmath92 .",
    "there were 72 stars with @xmath93 , and they show nearly the same degree of asymmetry in their motions as our first sample . it is likely that a significant number of these stars have real proper motions .",
    "however , it will take extra effort to distinguish them from the growing number of false detections , and to check their photometry ( many of them are fainter than the stars in our sample ) . as we sift through this set of stars with less significant motions",
    ", we can also try to improve the @xmath6 and @xmath4 measurements of our stars , so that we will not discard so many candidates due to their uncertain colors .",
    "finally , we can apply the same techniques to find stars with large proper motions in other deep fields with multiple visits by subaru .",
    "our next target will be the area of the subaru / xmm - newton deep survey ( @xcite , @xcite ) , which is roughly in the opposite direction from the sdf .",
    "we can use it to check our results in the sdf , but also to look for differences predicted by models of galactic populations .",
