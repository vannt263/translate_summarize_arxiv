    "<S> such a correlation is important for constructing the nuclear matter equation of state and studying the density dependence of the symmetry energy ; a key unknown in the equation of state of asymmetric nuclear matter .    </S>",

    "<S> , the entropic contribution to the symmetry free energy is assumed to be small ( the contribution becomes important at densities below 0.008 @xmath22 @xcite ) , the symmetry energy can therefore be reliably substituted for the free energy .    </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 shows the comparison between the smm calculated and the measured @xmath10 for both pairs of systems . </S>",
    "<S> the dotted curves correspond to the calculation for the primary fragments and the solid curves to the secondary fragments . </S>",

    "<S> it is observed that , within the given uncertainties , the decrease in the @xmath10 values with increasing excitation energy and decreasing isospin difference @xmath23 , of the systems is well reproduced by the smm calculation . </S>",
    "<S> one also notes that the effect of sequential decay effect on the isoscaling parameter is small as has been observed in several other studies using statistical models @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> it is evident from the figure that the temperatures obtained from the smm calculations are in good agreement with the overall trend of the caloric curve . </S>",
    "<S> somewhat lower value for the temperature is observed when the break - up density of the system is kept constant at 1/3 the normal nuclear density . by allowing the break - up density to evolve with the excitation energy , a near plateau that agrees with the experimentally measured caloric curves </S>",
    "<S> is obtained . </S>",
    "<S> this assures that the input parameters used in the smm calculation for comparing with the data are reasonable .            </S>",
    "<S> the symmetry energies obtained from the statistical model comparison of the experimental isoscaling parameter @xmath10 , are as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 . a steady decrease in the symmetry energy with increasing excitation energy </S>",
    "<S> is observed for both pairs of systems . </S>",
    "<S> such a decrease has also been observed in several other studies @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have also estimated the effect of the symmetry energy evolving during the sequential de - excitation of the primary fragments @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the phase diagram of the multifragmenting system is two dimensional and hence the excitation energy dependence of the temperature ( the caloric curve ) must take into account the density dependence too . </S>",
    "<S> often this dependence is neglected while studying the caloric curve . in the following , </S>",
    "<S> we attempt to extract the density of the fragmenting system as a function of excitation energy . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown by sobotka _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , that the plateau in the caloric curve could be a consequence of the thermal expansion of the system at higher excitation energy and decreasing density . by assuming that the decrease in the breakup density , as taken in the present statistical multifragmentation calculation , can be approximated by the expanding fermi gas model , and furthermore the temperature in eq . </S>",
    "<S> 1 and the temperature in the fermi - gas relation are related , one can extract the density as a function of excitation energy using the relation    @xmath25    in the above expression , the momentum and the frequency dependent factors in the effective mass ratio are taken to be one as expected at high excitation energies and low densities studied in this work @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the resulting densities for the two pairs of systems are shown in fig . 4 by the solid circles and inverted triangles . </S>",
    "<S> for comparison , we also show the break - up densities obtained from the analysis of the apparent level density parameters required to fit the measure caloric curve by natowitz _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite from the coulomb barrier systematics that are required to fit the measured intermediate mass fragment kinetic energy spectra . </S>",
    "<S> one observes that the present results obtained by requiring to fit the measured isoscaling parameters and the caloric curve are in good agreement with those obtained by natowitz _ et al_. the figure also shows the fixed freeze - out density of 1/3 ( dashed line ) and 1/6 ( dotted line ) the saturation density assumed in various statistical model comparisons .    </S>",
    "<S> it is evident from figures 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 that the decrease in the experimental isoscaling parameter @xmath10 , symmetry energy , break - up density , and the flattening of the temperature with increasing excitation energy are all correlated . </S>",
    "<S> one can thus conclude that the expansion of the system during the multifragmentation process leads to a decrease in the isoscaling parameter , decrease in the symmetry energy and density , and the flattening of the temperature with excitation energy . </S>",
    "<S> table i shows the correlated quantities obtained using eqs . 1 and 2 for both pairs of systems .        </S>",
    "<S> [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     from the above correlation between the symmetry energy as a function of excitation energy , and the density as a function of excitation energy , we obtain the symmetry energy as a function of density . </S>",
    "<S> this is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5 . for both pairs of systems . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature in the present work remains nearly constant for the range of excitation energies studied , the observed decrease in the symmetry energy with increasing excitation energy is therefore a consequence of decreasing density . </S>",
    "<S> this is also supported by microscopic calculations which shows an extremely slow evolution of the symmetry energy with temperature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution is practically negligible for the temperature range studied in this work . also shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5 is the symmetry energy value of khoa _ et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , ( solid square ) obtained by fitting the experimental differential cross - section data in a charge exchange reaction using the isospin dependent optical potential . </S>",
    "<S> the solid curve corresponds to the dependence , e@xmath26 @xmath2 31.6 ( @xmath3 , obtained by comparing the present data with the antisymmetrized molecular dynamic ( amd ) calculation @xcite , in previous work @xcite . the similarities in the density dependence of the symmetry energy obtained from the present statistical model approach and the amd model approach is intriguing . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that the symmetry energy shown by the solid curve in the figure relates to the volume part of the symmetry energy as in infinite nuclear matter , whereas , the symmetry energy obtained from the present study ( solid circles and inverted triangles ) relates to the fragment that are finite and has surface contribution . </S>",
    "<S> the similarity between the two can be understood in terms of the weakening of the surface symmetry free energy when the fragments are being formed . during the density fluctuation in uniform low density matter , </S>",
    "<S> the fragments are not completely isolated and continue to interact with each other , resulting in a decrease in the surface contribution as predicted by ono _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the present observation therefore lends credence to the fact that it is possible to directly obtain the properties of infinite nuclear matter from the fragments produced in the multifragmentation process @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more studies are required to illustrate this point further .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have studied the isoscaling parameter , symmetry energy , temperature and density as a function of excitation energy in reactions populating a @xmath12 100 mass region . </S>",
    "<S> it is observed that the decrease in the experimental isoscaling parameter @xmath10 , symmetry energy , breakup density , and the flattening of the temperature with increasing excitation energy are related to each other . the observed decrease in the symmetry energy with increasing excitation energy appears to be mainly a consequence of decreasing density . </S>",
    "<S> the symmetry energy as a function of density obtained from the present study is consistent with those obtained from the dynamical amd calculation , indicating that the surface contribution to the symmetry energy could be small . </S>"
