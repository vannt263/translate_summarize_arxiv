    "elliptic curves over number fields with explicit complex multiplication by cm - orders with small discriminants are reduced modulo suitable primes  @xmath3 ; an explicit endomorphism on the cm curve reduces to an efficient endomorphism over the finite field .",

    "here , curves over @xmath38 are viewed over @xmath0 ; the @xmath3-power sub - frobenius induces an extremely efficient endomorphism on the quadratic twist ( which can have prime order ) .",
    "these two constructions have since been combined to give 3- and 4-dimensional variants  @xcite , and extended to hyperelliptic curves in a variety of ways  @xcite .",
    "however , basic glv and gls remain the archetypal constructions .     in this work ,",
    "we propose a new source of elliptic curves over @xmath0 with efficient endomorphisms : quadratic @xmath1-curves .",
    "[ def : qq - curves ] a _",
    "quadratic @xmath1-curve of degree @xmath39 _ is an elliptic curve @xmath6 _ without _ complex multiplication , defined over a quadratic number field @xmath40 , such that there exists an isogeny of degree @xmath39 from @xmath6 to its galois conjugate @xmath41 , where @xmath42 .",
    "( the galois conjugate @xmath41 is the curve formed by applying @xmath43 to all of the coefficients of @xmath6 . )",
    "@xmath1-curves are well - established objects of interest in number theory , where they have formed a natural setting for generalizations of the shimura  taniyama conjecture .",
    "survey  @xcite gives an excellent introduction to this beautiful theory .",
    "our application of quadratic @xmath1-curves is rather more prosaic : given a @xmath39-isogeny @xmath44 over a quadratic field , we reduce modulo an inert prime @xmath3 to obtain an isogeny @xmath45 over @xmath0 .",
    "we then exploit the fact that the @xmath3-power frobenius isogeny maps @xmath41 back onto @xmath6 ; composing with the reduced @xmath39-isogeny , we obtain an endomorphism of @xmath6 of degree @xmath46 . for efficiency reasons",
    ", @xmath39 must be small ; it turns out that for small values of @xmath39 , we can write down one - parameter families of @xmath1-curves ( our approach below was inspired by the explicit techniques of hasegawa  @xcite ) .",
    "we thus obtain one - parameter families of elliptic curves over  @xmath0 equipped with efficient non - integer endomorphisms . for these endomorphisms we can give convenient explicit formul for short scalar decompositions ( see  [ sec : decompositions ] ) .    for concrete examples , we concentrate on the cases @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( in  [ sec : degree-2 ] and   [ sec : degree-3 ] , respectively ) , where the endomorphism is more efficient than a single doubling ( we briefly discuss higher degrees in   [ sec : further ] ) . for maximum generality and flexibility , we define our curves in short weierstrass form ; but we include transformations to montgomery , twisted edwards , and doche  icart  kohel models where appropriate in   [ sec : models ] .     like glv ,",
    "our method involves reducing curves defined over number fields to obtain curves over finite fields with explicit complex multiplication .",
    "however , we emphasise a profound difference : in our method , the curves over the number fields generally _ do not have complex multiplication themselves_.    glv curves are necessarily isolated examples  and the really useful examples are extremely limited in number ( see  ( * ? ? ? * app .",
    "a ) for a list of curves ) .",
    "the scarcity of glv curves is the kronecker class number @xmath49 , which is in @xmath50 .",
    "of course , for the tiny values of @xmath51 in question , the asymptotics of @xmath49 are irrelevant ; for the six @xmath51 corresponding to endomorphisms of degree at most 3 , we have @xmath52 , so there is only one @xmath53-invariant . for @xmath54 ( corresponding to @xmath55 )",
    "there are two or four twists over @xmath38 ; for @xmath56 ( corresponding to @xmath57 ) we have two or six , and otherwise we have only two . in particular , there are at most 18 distinct curves over @xmath38 with a non - integer endomorphism of degree at most 3 . ]",
    "is their achilles heel : as noted in  @xcite , if  @xmath3 is fixed then there is no guarantee that there will exist a glv curve with prime ( or almost - prime ) order over  @xmath58 .",
    "consider the situation discussed in  @xcite : the most efficient glv curves have cm discriminants @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "if we are working at a 128-bit security level , then the choice @xmath5 allows particularly fast arithmetic in @xmath38 .",
    "but the largest prime factor of the order of a curve over @xmath38 with cm discriminant @xmath60 ( resp .",
    "@xmath59 ) has @xmath61 ( resp .",
    "@xmath62 ) bits : using these curves wastes 9 ( resp .",
    "13 ) potential bits of security .",
    "in fact , we are lucky with @xmath56 and @xmath60 : for all of the other discriminants offering endomorphisms of degree at most 3 , we can do no better than a 95-bit prime factor , which represents a catastrophic 80-bit loss of relative security .",
    "in contrast , our construction yields true families of curves , covering @xmath63 isomorphism classes over @xmath0 .",
    "this gives us a vastly higher probability of finding prime ( or almost - prime)-order curves over practically important fields .     like gls",
    ", we construct curves over @xmath0 equipped with an inseparable endomorphism .",
    "while these curves are not defined over the prime field , the fact that the extension degree is only 2 means that weil descent attacks offer no advantage when solving dlp instances ( see  @xcite ) . and like gls , our families offer around @xmath3 distinct isomorphism classes of curves , making it easy to find secure group orders when @xmath3 is fixed .",
    "but unlike gls , our curves have @xmath53-invariants in @xmath0 : they are not isomorphic to or twists of subfield curves .",
    "this allows us to find twist - secure curves , which are resistant to the fouque ",
    "lercier  ral  valette fault attack  @xcite .",
    "as we will see in  [ sec : gls ] , our construction reduces to gls in the degenerate case @xmath64 ( that is , where @xmath65 is an isomorphism ) .",
    "our construction is therefore a sort of generalized gls  though it is not the higher - degree generalization anticipated by galbraith , lin , and scott themselves , which composes the sub - frobenius with a non - rational separable homomorphism and its dual homomorphism ( cf .",
    "* theorem  1 ) ) .    in  [ sec : decompositions ] , we prove that we can immediately obtain decompositions of the same bitlength as gls for curves over the same fields : the decompositions produced by our proposition  [ prop : bitlength ] are identical to the gls decompositions of  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma  2 ) when @xmath64 , up to sign .",
    "for this reason , we do not provide extensive implementation details in this paper : while our endomorphisms cost a few more @xmath7-operations to evaluate than the gls endomorphism , this evaluation is typically carried out only once per scalar multiplication .",
    "this evaluation is the only difference between a gls scalar multiplication and one of ours : the subsequent multiexponentiations have exactly the same length as in gls , and the underlying curve and field arithmetic is the same , too .",
    "throughout , we work over fields of characteristic not 2 or 3 .",
