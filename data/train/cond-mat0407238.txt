    "the experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite evidence for an exceptionally strong electron - phonon interaction in novel superconductors is now so overwhelming that even some advocates of the non - phononic mechanisms @xcite admit the fact .",
    "a few authors ( see , for example @xcite ) explored a view that the extension of the bcs theory towards the strong interaction between electrons and ion vibrations describes the phenomenon . in this regime , pairing takes place in real space due to a polaron collapse of the fermi energy @xcite , or due to a low density of carriers . at first sight , bipolarons have a mass too large to be mobile .",
    "indeed , anderson @xcite introduced small bipolarons as entirely localised objects explaining some unusual properties of chalcogenide glasses .",
    "however , it has been shown more recently that the inclusion of the on - site coulomb repulsion leads to the favoured binding of intersite carriers @xcite .",
    "the intersite bipolarons can tunnel with an effective mass of about 10 electron masses @xcite , and account for a high critical temperature @xcite .",
    "soon after anderson @xcite and street and mott @xcite introduced localized pairs in amorphous semiconductors , a two component model of negative @xmath0 centers coupled with the fermi sea of itinerant fermions was employed to study superconductivity in disordered metal - semiconductor alloys @xcite .",
    "when the attractive potential @xmath0 is large , the model is reduced to localized hard - core bosons spontaneously decaying into itinerant electrons and vice versa , different from a non - converting mixture of mobile charged bosons and fermions @xcite . this boson - fermion model ( bfm )",
    "was applied more generally to describe pairing electron processes with localization - delocalization @xcite , and a linear resistivity in the normal state of cuprates @xcite .",
    "the model attracted more attention in connection with high - temperature superconductors @xcite , as an alternative to the bipolaron model of cuprates with intrincically mobile bipolarons @xcite .",
    "in particular , refs .",
    "@xcite claimed that 2d bfm with immobile hard - core bosons is capable to reproduce some physical properties and the phase diagram of cuprates .",
    "bfm has been also adopted for a description of superfluidity of atomic fermions scattered into bound ( molecular ) states @xcite .",
    "most studies of bfm below its transition into a low - temperature condensed phase applied a mean - field approximation ( mfa ) , replacing zero - momentum boson operators by c - numbers and neglecting the boson self - energy in the density sum rule @xcite . when the bare boson energy is well above the chemical potential , the bcs ground state was found with bosons being only virtually excited @xcite .",
    "mfa led to a conclusion that bfm exhibits features compatible with bcs characteristics @xcite , and describes a crossover from the bcs - like to local pair behaviour @xcite .",
    "the transition was found more mean - field - like than the usual bose condensation , i.e. characterized by a relatively small value of the fluctuation parameter @xmath1 @xcite .    at the same time",
    "our previous study of bfm @xcite beyond mfa revealed a crucial effect of the boson self - energy on the normal state boson spectral function and the transition temperature @xmath2 .",
    "ref.@xcite proved that the cooper pairing of fermions via virtual bosonic states is impossible in any - dimensional bfm .",
    "it occurs only simultaneously with the bose - einstein condensation of real bosons .",
    "the origin of this simultaneous condensation lies in a softening of the boson mode at @xmath3 caused by its hybridization with fermions .",
    "the energy of zero - momentum bosons is renormalized down to _",
    "zero _ at @xmath3 , no matter how weak the boson - fermion coupling and how large the bare boson energy are @xcite .",
    "one can also expect that the boson self - energy should qualitatively modify the phase transition and the whole condensed phase of bfm below @xmath4 .    in this paper the phase transition and the condensed state of bfm",
    "are examined beyond the ordinary mean - field approximation in two and three dimensions .",
    "it is shown that @xmath5 k in the two - dimensional model , even in the absence of any coulomb repulsion , and the phase transition is never a bcs - like second - order phase transition even in 3d bfm because of the complete boson softening . a closed set of equations for fermion and boson green s functions ( gfs ) is derived taking into account the self - energy effects in the condensed state of 3d bfm .",
    "there exist a boson _ pair _ condensate along with the fermion cooper pair and the single - particle boson condensate in the model .",
    "remarkably , the gorkov expansion @xcite of gfs in the strength of the order parameter yields a zero linear term at _ any _ temperature below @xmath4 , and zero upper critical field .",
    "2d bfm is defined by the hamiltonian , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the 2d energy spectrum of fermions , @xmath8 is the bare boson energy with respect to their chemical potential @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the magnitude of the anisotropic hybridization interaction , @xmath11 is the anisotropy factor , and @xmath12 is the number of cells . here and further i take @xmath13 and the lattice constant @xmath14 . ref .",
    "@xcite argued that superconductivity is induced in this model from the anisotropic charge - exchange interaction ( @xmath15 ) between the conduction - band fermions and the immobile hard - core bosons , and the on - site coulomb repulsion competes with this pairing reducing the critical temperature @xmath2 less than by 25% .",
    "also it has been argued @xcite , that the calculated upper critical field of the model fits well the experimental results in cuprates .    here",
    "i show that @xmath5 k in the two - dimensional model , eq.(1 ) , even in the absence of any coulomb repulsion , and the mean - field approximation is meaningless for any - dimensional bfm because of the complete boson softening .    replacing boson operators by @xmath16-numbers for @xmath17 in eq.(1 ) one obtains a linearised bcs - like equation for the fermion order - parameter ( the gap function ) @xmath18 , @xmath19 with the coupling constant @xmath20 , renormalized by the hard - core effects .",
    "using a two - particle fermion vertex part in the cooper channel one can prove that this equation is perfectly correct even beyond the conventional non - crossing approximation @xcite .",
    "the problem with mfa does not stem from this bsc - like equation , but from an incorrect definition of the bare boson energy with respect to the chemical potential , @xmath21 .",
    "this energy is determined by the atomic density of bosons ( @xmath22 ) as ( eq.(9 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath23 while eq.(2 ) is correct , eq.(3 ) is incorrect because the boson self - energy @xmath24 due to the same hybridization interaction is missing . at first sight @xcite",
    "the self - energy is small in comparison to the kinetic energy of fermions , if @xmath10 is small .",
    "however @xmath25 diverges logarithmically at zero temperature @xcite , no matter how week the interaction is .",
    "therefore it should be kept in the density sum - rule , eq.(3 ) . introducing the boson green s function",
    "@xmath26 one must replace incorrect eq.(3 ) by    @xmath27 where @xmath28 , and @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "the divergent ( cooperon ) contribution to @xmath31 is given by fig.1 @xcite , @xmath32+\\tanh [ \\xi _ { { \\bf k+q}/2% } /(2t)]}{\\xi _ { { \\bf k - q}/2}+\\xi _ { { \\bf k+q}/2}-i\\omega } , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so that one obtains @xmath33 for small @xmath34 and any anisotropy factor compatible with the point - group symmetry of the cuprates .",
    "here @xmath35 is the boson mass , calculated analytically in ref.@xcite for the isotropic exchange interaction and parabolic fermion band dispersion ( see also ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the bcs - like equation ( 2 ) has a nontrivial solution for @xmath36 at @xmath3 , if @xmath37 substituting eq.(7 ) and eq.(8 ) into the sum - rule , eq.(5 ) , one obtains a logarithmically divergent integral with respect to @xmath38 , and @xmath39 the devastating result , eq.(9 ) is a direct consequence of the well - known theorem , which states that bec is impossible in 2d .",
    "one may erroneously believe that mfa results@xcite can be still applied in three - dimensions , where bec is possible .",
    "however , increasing dimensionality does not make mfa a meaningful approximation for the boson - fermion model .",
    "this approximation leads to a naive conclusion that a bcs - like superconducting state occurs below the critical temperature @xmath40 via fermion pairs being _ virtually _ excited into @xmath41 bosonic states @xcite . here",
    "@xmath42 and @xmath43 is the density of states ( dos ) in the fermionic band near the fermi level @xmath44 .",
    "however , the cooper pairing of fermions is impossible via virtual unoccupied bosonic states also in 3d bfm . indeed ,",
    "eqs.(2,8 ) do not depend on the dimensionality , so that the analytical continuation of eq.(4 ) to real frequencies @xmath45 yields the partial boson dos as @xmath46 at @xmath3 and @xmath17 in any - dimensional bfm .",
    "the cooper pairing may occur only simultaneously with the bose - einstein condensation of real bosons in the exact theory of 3d bfm @xcite .",
    "the origin of the simultaneous condensation of the fermionic and bosonic fields in 3d bfm lies in the softening of the boson mode at @xmath3 caused by its hybridization with fermions .",
    "taking into account the boson damping and dispersion shows that the boson spectrum significantly changes for all momenta .",
    "continuing the self - energy , eq.(6 ) to real frequencies yields the damping ( i.e. the imaginary part of the self - energy ) as @xcite @xmath47,\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is a coherence length , and @xmath49 is the fermi velocity .",
    "the damping is significant when @xmath50 . in this region @xmath51",
    "is comparable or even larger than the boson energy @xmath45 .",
    "hence bosons look like overdamped diffusive modes , rather than quasiparticles in the long - wave limit @xcite , contrary to the erroneous conclusion of ref.@xcite , that there is the onset of coherent free - particle - like motion of the bosons in this limit . only outside the long - wave region",
    ", the damping becomes small .",
    "indeed , using eq.(10 ) one obtains @xmath52 , so that bosons at @xmath53 are well defined quasiparticles with a logarithmic dispersion , @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "hence the boson energy disperses over the whole energy interval from zero up to @xmath55 .",
    "the main mathematical problem with mfa in 3d also stems from the density sum rule , eq.(5 ) which determines the chemical potential of the system and consequently the bare boson energy @xmath21 as a function of temperature . in the framework of mfa",
    "one takes the bare boson energy in eq.(2 ) as a temperature independent parameter , @xmath56 @xcite , or determines it from the conservation of the total number of particles neglecting the boson self - energy , eq.(3 ) @xcite",
    ". then eq.(2 ) looks like the conventional linearized ginzburg - landau - gorkov equation @xcite with a negative coefficient @xmath57 at @xmath58 in the linear term .",
    "then one concludes that the phase transition is almost the conventional bcs - like transition , at least at @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "these findings are mathematically and physically erroneous .",
    "indeed , the term of the sum in eq.(5 ) with @xmath60 is given by the integral @xmath61 the integral converges , if and only if @xmath62 .",
    "in fact , @xmath63 is strictly zero in the bose - condensed state , because @xmath64 $ ] corresponds to the boson chemical potential relative to the lower edge of the boson energy spectrum .",
    "more generally , @xmath65 corresponds to the appearance of the bogoliubov - goldstone mode due to a broken symmetry below @xmath4 .",
    "this exact result makes the bsc equation ( 2 ) simply an identity @xcite with @xmath66 at any temperature below @xmath4 . on the other hand",
    ", mfa violates the density sum - rule , predicting the wrong negative @xmath67 below @xmath4 .    since @xmath68",
    ", one may expect that the conventional upper critical field , @xmath69 is zero in bfm . to determine @xmath69 and explore the condensed phase of 3d bfm",
    ", one can apply the gorkov formalism @xcite , as described below .",

    "the matsubara field operators , @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) evolve with the imaginary time @xmath79 as    @xmath80    the theory of the condensed state can be formulated with the normal and anomalous fermion gfs @xcite , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , respectively , where the operation @xmath83 performs the time ordering .",
    "fermionic and bosonic fields condense simalteneously @xcite . following bogoliubov @xcite the bosonic condensate",
    "is described by separating a large matrix element @xmath84 in @xmath85 as a number , while the remaining part @xmath86 describes a supracondensate field , @xmath87 . then using eq.(16 )",

    "the equations for gfs are obtained by using eqs .",
    "( 14 - 16 ) and the diagrammatic technique @xcite in the framework of the non - crossing approximation @xcite , as shown in fig.2 and fig.3",
    ".    an important novel feature of bfm is a pairing of supracondensate bosons , caused by their hybridization with the fermionic condensate , as follows from the last diagram in fig.3 .",

    "the fermionic order parameter , renormalised with respect to the mean - field @xmath106 due to the formation of the boson - pair condensate , is given by @xmath107 and the boson - pair order parameter , generated by the hybridization with the fermion cooper pairs , is @xmath108 hence , there are three coupled condensates in the model described by the off - diagonal fields @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 , rather than two , as in mfa . at low temperatures all of them have about the same magnitude , as the fermion , fig.4 , and boson , fig.1 , self - energies , @xmath112 @xmath113 respectively .    on the other hand , when the temperature is close to @xmath4 ( i.e. @xmath114 ) , the boson pair condensate is weak compared with the single - particle boson and the cooper pair condensates . in this temperature range @xmath111 , eq.(25 )",

    "the first one is the density sum - rule , eq.(5 ) , for bosons which is not applied to phonons .",
    "the second being that the boson self - energy is given by the divergent ( at @xmath132 ) cooperon diagram , while the self - energy of phonons is finite at small coupling .    in the homogeneous case @xmath133 should be determined from eq.(5 ) rather than from the bcs - like equation ( 2 ) , which is actually the identity . to get an insight into the magnetic properties of the condensed phase one has to solve eqs.(18,19 ) and",
    "eq.(5 ) keeping the non - linear terms .",
    "even at temperatures well below @xmath4 the condensed state is fundamentally different from the mfa ground state , because of the pairing of bosons .",

    "the pair - boson condensate should significantly modify the thermodynamic properties of the condensed bfm compared with the mfa predictions .",
