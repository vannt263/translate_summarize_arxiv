    "laboratory experiments @xcite and numerical simulations @xcite can now systematically explore sustained homogeneous nonequilibrium systems of quite large aspect ratios ( @xmath2 ) which possibly approximate a thermodynamic limit of infinite system size .",
    "these advances raise the theoretical question of identifying order parameters for analyzing and classifying spatiotemporal chaotic states so that a quantitative comparison can be made between theory and experiment @xcite .",
    "the most appropriate order parameter for a given nonequilibrium system is presently not well understood although numerous possibilities have been studied .",
    "some order parameters , such as spatial correlation lengths obtained from exponentially decaying correlation functions , emphasize the average spatial disorder and have been widely used in condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "others such as the metric entropy and the lyapunov fractal dimension @xcite are familiar from nonlinear dynamics and emphasize the average temporal disorder or dynamical complexity arising from the geometric structure of an attractor in phase space .",
    "we would then like to know whether these different kinds of order parameters are related and whether there is a need for new order parameters .",
    "as an example , does knowledge of an easily measured correlation length give information about the fractal dimension , which is difficult to estimate from experimental time series @xcite ? that a relation between spatial disorder and dynamical complexity may exist is suggested by the prominence in many nonequilibrium states of defects @xcite whose dynamics often determine the average spatial disorder @xcite .",
    "examples of defects are amplitude holes in one - dimensional complex ginzburg - landau equation ( abbreviated below as cgle ) @xcite , domain walls and droplets of opposite spin in coupled map lattices ( cmls ) with an ising - like transition @xcite , vortices in the two - dimensional cgle @xcite , and spirals and centers in the recently discovered spiral - defect chaos state in thermal convection @xcite .",
    "the nucleation , motion , and annihilation of defects are important features of the chaotic dynamics and so dynamical quantities such as the fractal dimension may be related to their spatial statistics @xcite .",
    "complicating this simple picture is the fact that not all fluctuations are associated with defect motion , e.g. , phase fluctuations in the cgle @xcite .",
    "the fractal dimension may then be larger than that suggested by defect statistics .    in recent work @xcite , egolf and greenside",
    "have explored the relation between temporal and spatial disorder for the cgle on a large periodic interval @xcite . observing that sufficiently large chaotic systems become extensive so that a fractal dimension  @xmath3 grows linearly with volume size  @xmath4 ( where  @xmath5 is the system size and  @xmath6 is the spatial dimensionality ) @xcite ,",
    "they calculated the dimension correlation length  @xmath0 which is defined @xcite in terms of the intensive dimension density @xmath7 by the equation @xmath8 the length  @xmath0 can be interpreted crudely as a characteristic size of dynamically independent subsystems or a characteristic range of chaotic fluctuations .",
    "near a transition from phase- to defect - turbulent states @xcite , egolf and greenside found that the length  @xmath0 was approximately equal to , and had the same parametric dependence as , the spatial correlation length given by the magnitude fluctuations of the ginzburg - landau field @xcite .",
    "over the same parameter range , the correlation length  @xmath9 arising from phase fluctuations ( and also of the ginzburg - landau field itself ) was found to increase to quite large values , suggesting that the chaos fluctuations measured by  @xmath0 were short - ranged and decoupled from the phase .    in this paper ,",
    "the one - dimensional investigations of egolf and greenside @xcite are extended by examining similar questions of how spatial disorder and dynamical complexity are related for spatial dimensionality @xmath10 and  @xmath11 .",
    "we study a class of dissipative coupled map lattices @xcite that undergoes an ising - like ferromagnetic - ordering transition as a lattice coupling constant  @xmath1 ( defined below in eq .",
    "( [ eq : miller - huse - map ] ) ) is increased through a range of finite positive values , corresponding to a transition from a high - temperature paramagnetic phase to a low - temperature ferromagnetic phase . instead of the point - like space - time defects of the one - dimensional cgle @xcite",
    ", long - lived defects occur in the form of domain walls and droplets involving regions of opposite sign . at a critical transition point",
    "@xmath12 , the usual two - point correlation length  @xmath13 diverges to infinity while the magnetization ( the average of the signs of all lattice variables ) bifurcates from a zero to nonzero value .",
    "the main attraction of the miller - huse model @xcite is that a transition with a diverging correlation length occurs from one chaotic state to another .",
    "this permits a careful comparison of different length scales near the transition point .    by calculating the lyapunov spectrum and related dynamical quantities such as the dimension correlation length  @xmath0",
    ", we show that correlations in chaotic fluctuations near the ordering transition have a short range and are decoupled from the diverging long - range order measured by the length  @xmath13 .",
    "as was the case for the 1d periodic cgle @xcite , the length  @xmath0 and the correlation length  @xmath14 arising from magnitude fluctuations of the cml variables both turn out to be short  here about one lattice spacing  but a quantitative relation can not be determined since these lengths do not vary substantially with parameters . in one - space dimension , a more substantial variation in these quantities",
    "is obtained by increasing the radius  @xmath15 of the coupling from nearest to @xmath15th - nearest lattice neighbors .",
    "with increasing radius  @xmath15 , the lengths @xmath0 and @xmath16 then increase approximately linearly and with slopes related by a factor of order one .",
    "this suggests that the two lengths may be related and that  @xmath15 is important in determining the length scale of dynamical fluctuations .",
    "several dynamical quantities such as the largest lyapunov exponent  @xmath17 , the metric entropy density  @xmath18 , and the lyapunov fractal dimension density  @xmath19 attain minimum values near  but distinctly not at  the critical transition point  @xmath12 . at first glance , minima in quantities such as  @xmath20 or",
    "@xmath19 seem counterintuitive since the onset of ferromagnetic ordering should correspond to increased correlations , i.e. , decreased dynamical complexity and a decreased dimension density or entropy density .",
    "such a monotonic decrease in the metric entropy is , in fact , observed for a non - dissipative equilibrium cml that undergoes an ising - like transition @xcite .",
    "but because the dimension correlation length  @xmath0 is quite short in the miller - huse model , we argue below that dynamical quantities are only sensitive to nearest neighbor dynamics .",
    "as the coupling constant  @xmath1 increases , the discrete laplacian eventually becomes antidiffusive , magnifying rather than reducing short - wavelength structure , and the dimension density and entropy density start to increase .",
    "the role of coupling lattice neighbors is demonstrated with calculations on periodic 2d  hexagonal and 3d  cubic lattices .",
    "for these cases , @xmath0 is again about one lattice spacing in size and the extrema in dynamical quantities occur at a value  @xmath21 determined by the number  @xmath22 of nearest neighbors ( @xmath23 for the square lattice , @xmath24 for the hexagonal and cubic lattices ) .",
    "the positions of the extrema do not coincide with the bifurcation of the magnetization and do not seem to depend on the lattice symmetry and dimensionality . the origin of these minima remains to be explained .",
    "these results , together with previous work on the 1d  cgle and with some unpublished work on cmls with algebraic decay of spatial correlations @xcite , suggest that the dimension correlation length will typically be short so that chaotic fluctuations are decoupled from long - range spatial order as measured by correlation functions .",
    "this leads to the qualitative conclusion that defects , although a striking visual feature of spatiotemporal chaos , are not the source of complexity that leads to large fractal dimensions and to small dimension correlation lengths .",
    "the physical meaning and utility of the length  @xmath0 remains to be understood and further studies on different kinds of systems will be useful .    the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ methods ] , we define the coupled map lattice and discuss some details of how its lyapunov spectrum is calculated using a cm-5 parallel computer @xcite . in section  [ results ] , we discuss various results of our simulations , especially the dependence of order parameters on the lattice coupling constant and on the symmetry and dimensionality of the lattice .",
    "finally , in section  [ conclusions ] , we summarize our results and relate them to other recent research .",
    "in this section , we define the mathematical models used in our simulations and discuss some details about how the lyapunov spectrum and spatial correlation lengths were calculated numerically . since a cm-5 parallel computer played an important role in our being able to explore large space - time regions for many parameter values , we also discuss some details of how the algorithms were adapted for parallel computation .",
    "as easily simulated models of spatiotemporal chaos , we consider homogeneous coupled map lattices ( cmls ) in which the same chaotic map  @xmath25 is associated with each point of a finite periodic lattice and for which nearest neighbor maps are coupled linearly by diffusion .",
    "cmls have a significant advantage over partial differential equations of being analytically amenable @xcite and easier to simulate on a computer .",
    "cmls have the drawback that their solutions can not generally be related quantitatively to experiment and they may not have universal critical properties near transitions @xcite .",
    "we study cmls suggested by recent work of miller and huse @xcite , who analyzed the long - wavelength properties of a two - dimensional cml that orders ferromagnetically , in analogy to the equilibrium ising model @xcite . following these authors",
    ", we use a lattice map  @xmath26 with odd symmetry so that domains of opposite `` spin '' or sign arise .",
    "the odd symmetry is a necessary but not sufficient condition @xcite for obtaining an ising - like transition in which the magnetization ( defined below in eq .",
    "( [ eq : magnetization - defn ] ) ) bifurcates to a nonzero value as a coupling constant  @xmath1 is varied . following miller and huse",
    ", we choose  @xmath25 to be a piecewise - linear map with slope of constant magnitude greater than one , for which only chaotic states of constant measure exist in the absence of lattice coupling .",

    "initial conditions consisted of assigning a random uniformly - distributed number in the interval @xmath40 $ ] to each site ; results were not dependent on the choice of initial conditions provided the integration time was sufficiently long .",
    "typical integration times were  @xmath41 iterations for calculations of lyapunov exponents and  @xmath42 iterations for calculations of correlation functions .",
    "we made a few runs with longer integration times of  @xmath43 and  @xmath44 to check the convergence of the lyapunov exponents and the correlation functions , respectively .",
    "different lattice sizes were used depending on which order parameters were being studied , typically @xmath45 for calculating lyapunov exponents ( which are quite costly to compute ) and @xmath46 for estimating correlation lengths .",
    "many runs were repeated using several lattice sizes to verify the absence of significant finite - size effects .    for calculations of statistical averages such as the magnetization and correlation functions ,",
    "the statistics could often be improved substantially by averaging the results of an ensemble of  @xmath47 runs each of duration  @xmath39 , with each run differing only in the choice of initial conditions .",
    "calculations indicate that this ensemble average is ergodically equivalent to a single integration of duration  @xmath48 @xcite . for most of the results reported below , we used an ensemble average over  @xmath49 runs which could be executed simultaneously and in parallel on the vector units of a 16-node partition of a cm-5 computer .",
