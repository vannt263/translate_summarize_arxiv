    "investigations of ergodicity of a physical quantity in a many - body system plays an important role in understanding statistical - mechanical properties of that system .",
    "the validity of a statistical - mechanical description of a quantity that characterizes a physical system depends on the behavior of that quantity in time - evolved states in comparison to that in the corresponding equilibrium states . a physical quantity is said to be ergodic if the time average of the quantity matches with its ensemble average .",

    "we find that while entanglement measures display ergodicity irrespective of the initial field strengths , quantum discord and quantum work - deficit are ergodic for both low and high transverse magnetic fields and nonergodic for moderate ones . for low fields , we prove ergodicity quite generally : arbitrary quantum correlation measures , irrespective of whether defined in the entanglement - separability paradigm or by using information - theoretic concepts , are ergodic , for any interacting system in a non - commuting step function field , in any dimension .",

    "the situation is drastically different for moderate fields .",
    "we begin by demonstrating that two entanglement measures , viz . , concurrence and logarithmic negativity , exhibit ergodic behavior , also for moderate fields .",
    "let us begin by considering the behavior for concurrence ( see fig .",

    "a nonzero anisotropy is necessary for the change in the transverse field to have any nontrivial effect on the evolution , and high temperature canonical states are known to have zero or near - zero quantum correlations . for the evolved state ,",
    "the time - averaged values of concurrence , at large times , for the exemplary values of @xmath136=0.2 , 0.6 , and 2.0 are 0.153 , 0.1149 , and 0 respectively",
    ". these are depicted in the figure ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1dinfall ] ( top - left ) ) as horizontal lines at the corresponding heights .",
    "the concurrence of the canonical equilibrium state starts off from zero for @xmath137 and converges to 0.153 at low temperatures .",
    "hence , there always exists a temperature for which the corresponding equilibrium value matches the time - averaged value in the evolved state , up to the 3rd significant digits .",
    "the feature is shared by other values of @xmath136 as well .",
    "therefore we conclude that the concurrence is ergodic for the infinite 1d @xmath0 spin model . for low values of the initial field , the concurrence may only be canonically ergodic .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig:1dinfall ] ( top - right ) that , along with the concurrence , the logarithmic negativity , another quantum correlation measure defined within the entanglement - separability paradigm , is also ergodic ( or at least canonically so ) in this model .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the question of ergodicity of logarithmic negativity was addressed for the 1d xy spin model by requiring that the energy of the equilibrium state and the dynamically evolved state is the same .",
    "this , however , is a stringent condition , and is not usually considered to be necessary for ergodicity considerations ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "rather surprisingly , we find that by removing this energy constraint , entanglement - like quantities ( including logarithmic negativity ) become ergodic in this model .",
    "measures of quantum correlation defined from an information - theoretic perspective exhibit a behavior that is opposite to that of entanglement measures , for moderate fields .",
    "let us first consider the case of qd . for low values of the applied transverse field , the qd remains ergodic ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1dinfall ] ( bottom - left ) ) .",
    "this is just like for entanglement measures and also follow directly from prop .",
    "however as the applied transverse field is increased to moderate values , there is no temperature for which the time - averaged value of qd matches with that of the canonical equilibrium value ",
    "qd is strongly nonergodic in the vicinity of @xmath138 .",
    "again the computations are performed by using successive jordan - wigner and fourier transformations . for even higher magnetic fields ",
    "e.g. for @xmath139 , ",
    "qd attains ergodicity only if we allow temperatures much higher  precisely two orders of magnitude higher  than the initial temperature , and hence we still term the situation as nonergodic , although not strongly so .",
    "surprisingly , we have also observed that qd shows nonergodicity even when its constituent quantities , @xmath140 and @xmath141 , are both ergodic .",
    "this arises due to the fact that @xmath140 and @xmath141 become ergodic at different temperature ranges , and so the ergodicity of qd does not remain a linear function of the ergodicities of @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "qd must be ergodic for @xmath142 , follows from prop .",
    "very similar features are observed in the other information - theoretic quantum correlation measure , viz .",
    ", quantum work - deficit ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1dinfall ] ( bottom - right ) ) .      in an attempt towards understanding the opposite behavior of the quantum correlations in the two prominent paradigms ,",
    "let us begin by contrasting qd against logarithmic negativity for the evolved state , with respect to the initial transverse field at large time ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1dinfde ] ) .",
    "we find that while logarithmic negativity is monotonic ( decreasing ) for the whole range of @xmath143 , qd is increasing for low values of magnetic field and decreasing for high values .",
    "this different behavior of the two measures hints at the different statistical - mechanical behavior for qd and logarithmic negativity .    another way to interpret the opposite behavior observed is the following .",
    "classical correlators , given by @xmath144 , of the states of a many - body quantum system has long been known in the literature of condensed matter @xcite and bell inequalities @xcite , among others , as important characterizing quantities of the physical system .",
    "quantum correlations have recently been identified to be interesting quantities of many - body systems @xcite .",
    "a typical multisite quantum state contains both quantum and classical correlations .",
    "the measures of entanglement strives to filter out only the quantum part of the correlations in a way that is very stringent , as compared to the information - theoretic measures of quantum correlations . indeed",
    ", even separable states have nonzero quantum discord @xcite and quantum work - deficit @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable that the information - theoretic measures of quantum correlations will behave more closely like the classical correlators , while measures defined within the entanglement - separability paradigm will behave oppositely thereof .",
    "the classical correlators in these systems have long been known to be generally nonergodic @xcite ( cf .",
    "they are ergodic for low transverse fields , while becoming nonergodic for moderate fields  exactly the feature obtained for quantum discord and quantum work - deficit , while exactly the opposite to that obtained for concurrence and logarithmic negativity .",
    "_ magnetic field regions. _ it is clear from fig .",
    "2 that whenever the applied field strength @xmath136 is approximately less than 0.4 , all the quantum correlation measures , whether they belong to the entanglement - separability paradigm or the information - theoretic one , have a low derivative ( slow change ) with respect to the applied field .",
    "we call such regions as `` low field regions ''",
    ". similar behavior ( of the measures ) is also observed when @xmath136 is approximately above 1.0 .",
    "such regions are called the `` high field regions '' .",
    "the remaining fields ( on the positive field axis ) fall in what we term as the `` moderate field region '' . in this moderate field region , all the quantum correlation measures have a substantially larger derivative values ( in comparison to the same in the other regions ) with respect to the applied field . it may be noted here that the quantity @xmath136 is a dimensionless quantity , so that the field ( @xmath105 ) regions are already defined in energy ( @xmath8 ) units .",
    "in the previous section , we considered the infinite @xmath0 spin chain in a transverse field and found that information - theoretic quantum correlation measures and those of the entanglement - separability paradigm have countering statistical - mechanical behavior .",
    "it will be interesting to see whether such complementary behavior is sustained even in higher - dimensional systems .",
    "however , the analytical methods do not exist for a ladder or a two - dimensional model and so we have to use numerical simulations to study them .",
    "the question remains whether results obtained by exact diagonalization can infer correctly the ergodic behavior of ladder or two - dimensions .",
    "hence , we first consider the finite @xmath0 spin chain of moderate length and compare their results with the infinite one .    the hamiltonian for a spin chain of 12 spins , with periodic boundary conditions , is given by @xmath145 -    h(t ) \\sum_{i=1}^{12 } s_i^z.\\ ] ] similar to the case of the infinite spin chain , an initial transverse field is applied as a disturbance on the initial canonical equilibrium state at @xmath146 , and then we allow the system to evolve .",
    "later , we compare the long time - average of the physical quantities for the evolved state and the canonical equilibrium state at different field strengths . the plots of concurrence , logarithmic negativity , quantum discord , and quantum work - deficit for the evolved state and the canonical equilibrium as functions of temperature are given in fig .",
    "[ fig:1dn12 ] .",
    "similar to the case of infinite @xmath0 chain , we observe that entanglement - based measures , viz . , concurrence and logarithmic negativity , remain ergodic for the entire range of the applied initial transverse magnetic field .",
    "however , the information - theoretic quantum correlation measures are ergodic for low and high values of applied transverse field and nonergodic at moderate values . to illustrate this , let us consider the case of qd , which remain ergodic for low initial fields ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1dn12 ] ( bottom - left ) ) . for moderate values of the initial field , qd becomes nonergodic , i.e , there is no temperature for which the time - averaged value of qd for the evolved state is equal to the qd of the equilibrium state .",
    "hence , the statistical - mechanical behavior of the quantum correlation measures defined in the entanglement - separability paradigm ( concurrence and logarithmic negativity ) and that of the measures defined in the information - theoretic one ( quantum discord and quantum work - deficit ) for finite 1d @xmath0 model of length @xmath147 , mimics the properties of the infinite spin chain .",
    "this induces us to study such statistical - mechanical behavior in the case of similar hamiltonians in higher dimensions , where we will be forced to consider finite - sized systems , as these systems are not analytically diagonalizable .",
    "this will be carried out in the two succeeding sections .",
    "the ladder arrangement of spins can be thought of as an intermediate dimension between one and two dimensions .",
    "these systems are interesting as they have revealed several intriguing features of both one and two dimensions .",
    "ladder models have been successfully realized in laboratories in certain materials and currently available techniques in cold gas systems also offer the possibility of realizing such models @xcite . the ladder model with periodic boundary conditions and @xmath0 interactions on steps as well as rungs",
    "is considered .",
    "again the system is evolved from the canonical equilibrium state with an initial temperature of @xmath146 , after applying a kick in the transverse magnetic field . as in the case of the infinite and finite spin chains , for moderately high fields , qd and quantum work - deficit",
    "are nonergodic , while nearest - neighbor entanglement ( concurrence as well as logarithmic negativity ) of steps as well as rungs remains ergodic . from fig .",
    "[ fig : ladn8 ] ( right ) , it is clear that the evolved state logarithmic negativity , plotted as horizontal lines corresponding to transverse field strengths of @xmath136=0.1 , 0.6 , and 2.0 , will definitely cross the logarithmic negativity of the canonical equilibrium state for some values of the temperature .",
    "such crossing of the equilibrium and evolved state entanglement curves does not happen for qd for initial fields @xmath148 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ladn8 ] ( left ) ) .",
    "thus the statistical behavior of nearest - neighbor entanglement - based measures and information - theoretic ones , qualitatively matches with those of the @xmath0 spin chain : entanglement measures are ergodic while information - theoretic ones are not so , for moderate field strengths .",
    "the two - dimensional quantum @xmath0 model with a transverse magnetic field plays an important role in both many - body physics and quantum information . in particular , the dynamics of this model in the case of unit anisotropy is used for realizing the measurement - based quantum computation @xcite .",
    "here we consider a two - dimensional array of 12 spin-@xmath1 particles arranged on a square lattice , and interacting via nearest - neighbor @xmath0 interactions with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the arrangement therefore forms a torus .    for various transverse field strengths , viz . ,",
    "@xmath149 and @xmath150 , we find that the entanglement - based measures show ergodicity also in this case .",
    "however , we find that for @xmath151 , the time - averaged qd of the evolved state has the value 0.0433 for an initial temperature , corresponding to @xmath146 , while the qd of the canonical equilibrium state converges to 0.0424 , and hence leads to nonergodicity .",
    "the same feature is shared by quantum work - deficit .",
    "in contrast , entanglement - based measures remain ergodic for all values of the transverse field , including @xmath151 .",
    "one may expect that the ergodic behavior of the quantum correlations in the 2d model will be different from that in the 1d model .",
    "however , simulations in finite 2d systems show a qualitatively similar behaviour as in 1d . however , some classical correlations ( of the form @xmath152 ) turn out to be ergodic in 2d , while they are not so in 1d @xcite .",
    "we have considered the statistical - mechanical properties of quantum correlations of the transverse quantum @xmath0 model with nearest - neighbor interactions in low dimensions with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we have shown that any quantum correlation measure of a hamiltonian with a time - independent interaction and a non - commuting time dependent field is ergodic for low fields , irrespective of the other parameters of the hamiltonian . moreover , for the infinite @xmath0 spin chain , with a high initial transverse magnetic field , we have analytically demonstrated that any quantum correlation measure is again ergodic .",
    "furthermore , we found that the quantum correlation measures defined in the entanglement - separability paradigm , equilibrate with time , and hence remain ergodic , while the information - theoretic quantum correlation measures can be nonergodic for moderate initial fields .",
    "the thesis is true for the infinite chain , which is exactly diagonalizable .",
    "low - dimensional finite systems , that can not be analytically diagonalized  ladder and two - dimensional models with periodic boundary conditions  mimics the one - dimensional infinite one .",
    "we therefore obtain a distinct partition that divides the world of quantum correlation measures  ones that are ergodic as opposed to the ones that are not so , in low - dimensional quantum transverse @xmath0 spin-@xmath1 systems .",
    "more interestingly , the partition coincides with that which divides them into entanglement - based quantum correlation measures and information - theoretic ones .",
