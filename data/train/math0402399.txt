    "whichever ordering , the definitions of @xmath116 and @xmath117 are always linked by @xmath144 , and   holds .",
    "let us briefly observe some similarities between the two mapping - walks .",
    "for each given basin @xmath8 of @xmath3 with say @xmath145 elements , the restriction of @xmath3 to @xmath8 is encoded in a segment of each walk which equals at @xmath18 at some time , and returns again to @xmath18 after @xmath146 more steps .",

    "we now apply the definitions above to a uniform random mapping @xmath3 .",
    "of course , the random partition @xmath149 of @xmath4 $ ] , and the random partition @xmath150 of @xmath151 , are the same no matter which ordering convention is used .",
    "each random partition is _",
    "exchangeable _ , meaning its distribution is invariant under the action of a permutation of @xmath4 $ ] .",
    "let us spell out some further symmetry properties , each of which turns out to have some analog in the limiting brownian scheme .    *",
    "( a ) * the cycles - first ordering  has the following very strong symmetry property : conditionally given @xmath152 the tree components in cycles - first ordering  form an exchangeable sequence of @xmath153 random subsets of @xmath4 $ ] ; moreover this exchangeable sequence is independent of the sequence of cycle sizes @xmath154 with @xmath155 .",
    "consequently , given @xmath152 , the cycles - first mapping - walk is a concatenation of @xmath153 exchangeable excursions away from @xmath18 , and this mapping - walk is independent of @xmath156 .    *",
    "( b ) * the basins - first ordering  does not share the symmetry property above .",
    "but it has a different one : given that the basin @xmath157 containing @xmath158 has size @xmath159 , the action of @xmath3 on @xmath4 - \\mathcal{b}_{n,1}$ ] is that of a uniform random mapping of a set of @xmath160 elements .",
    "so given @xmath159 , the basins - first mapping - walk decomposes after @xmath146 steps into two independent segments : the first @xmath146 steps are distributed like the basins - first walk for a uniform mapping of @xmath161 $ ] conditioned to have a single basin , and the remaining @xmath162 steps distributed like the basins - first walk associated with a uniform mapping of @xmath163 $ ] .    *",
    "( c ) * the sequence of basin sizes @xmath164 does not have the same distribution for both orderings .",
    "for instance , if @xmath165 in the basins - first orderingthen @xmath165 in the cycles - first ordering , but ( for @xmath166 ) not conversely",
    ". so the distribution of @xmath167 must be different in the two orderings .    *",
    "( d ) * for a given mapping @xmath3 , the sequence of cycle sizes @xmath168 may be different for the two different orderings .",
    "but for @xmath3 with uniform distribution on @xmath4^{[n]}$ ] , the two sequences of cycle sizes have the same distribution : given @xmath169 , either sequence is distributed like the sizes of cycles of a uniform random permutation of @xmath170 $ ] in the ( size - biased ) order of least elements of the cycles .",
    "that is to say , given @xmath169 , the distribution of @xmath171 is uniform on @xmath170 $ ] ; given @xmath169 and @xmath171 with @xmath172 , the distribution of @xmath173 is uniform on @xmath174 $ ] , and so on . this is a well known property of uniform random permutations for the cycles - first ordering , and was shown for the basins - first ordering in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 22 ) .",
    "we now come to the main point of section  [ aldous : sec - rm ] : the definitions of the interval partitions of brownian bridge are motivated by the following theorem .",

    "moreover ,    _ ( i)_for the cycles - first ordering , with the cycles @xmath116 in order of their least elements , these two limits in distribution hold jointly with @xmath180 as @xmath78 varies , where the limits are the lengths and increments of local time of @xmath6 at @xmath18 associated with the interval partition @xmath181 ; whereas    _ ( ii ) @xcite_for the basins - first ordering , with the basins @xmath116 listed in order of their least elements , the same is true , provided the limiting interval partition is defined instead by @xmath182 .",
    "the result for basins - first ordering   is part of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 8) .",
    "the variant for cycles - first ordering  can be established by a variation of the argument in @xcite , exploiting the exchangeability property of the cycles - first ordering ( section  [ aldous : comfacts](a ) instead of section  [ aldous : comfacts ] ( b ) ) .",
    "see also @xcite and @xcite for alternate approaches to the basic result of @xcite .",

    "indeed we show in section  [ aldous : sec - comp ] that the results of theorem  [ aldous : crl1 ] hold much more generally , so these results do not really involve much of the rich combinatorial structure of mapping digraphs involved in theorem  [ aldous : thconv ] .    *",
    "( a ) * in the basins - first ordering , the first basin is by definition the basin containing element @xmath158 , and its walk - segment ends at the first time that the walk returns to @xmath18 after the basins - first search has reached element @xmath158 .",
    "suppose we could replace element @xmath158 by a uniform random element , so the walk - segment corresponds asymptotically to the walk - segment ending at the first time of reaching @xmath18 after a uniform random time on @xmath183 $ ] .",
    "rescaling , this corresponds to the time interval @xmath184 $ ] in definition  [ aldous : ddef ] .",
    "of course it is not obvious , and indeed is somewhat counter - intuitive , that replacing element @xmath158 by a uniform random element will preserve length of walk - segment .",
    "but this is what eventually will emerge from our calculations .",
    "now consider the cycles - first ordering .",
    "the first basin is by definition the basin containing the smallest - numbered cyclic element @xmath185 , and its walk - segment ends at the first time after reaching element @xmath185 that the walk returns to @xmath18 .",
    "suppose as before ( and again this is not obvious ) one can replace element @xmath185 by a uniform random _ cyclic _ element , so the walk - segment corresponds asymptotically to the walk - segment ending at the first time of reaching @xmath18 after visiting @xmath186 cyclic vertices , where @xmath187 has uniform@xmath14 $ ] distribution .",
    "rescaling , this corresponds to the time interval @xmath188 $ ] in definition  [ aldous : tdef ] .    *",
    "( b ) * the recursive property of the basins - first ordering  in section  [ aldous : comfacts](b ) plainly corresponds , under the asymptotics of theorem  [ aldous : thconv ] , to the recursive decomposition of brownian bridge at time @xmath189 described later in lemma  [ aldous : lmm - drec ] .    * ( c ) * in section  [ aldous : comfacts](c ) we observed that the distribution of @xmath157 was different in the two orderings .",
    "this difference persists in the limit : theorem  [ aldous : thconv ] and the calculation below   imply @xmath190 * ( d ) * it is well known @xcite that the asymptotic distribution as @xmath0 of the fractions of elements in cycles of a random permutation of @xmath4 $ ] , with the cycles in order of their least elements , ( which amounts to a size - biased random order by exchangeability ) , is the _ uniform stick - breaking sequence _ @xmath191 .",
    "so the convergence in distribution of @xmath192 to @xmath193 , and the  uniform random permutation \" feature of the cyclic decomposition ( section  [ aldous : comfacts](d ) ) , combine to show that with _ either _ ordering @xmath194 with the same joint distribution : @xmath195 for both @xmath196 and @xmath197 .",

    "( e ) * let @xmath198 be the @xmath78th largest basin of @xmath3 , with some arbitrary convention for breaking ties , and let @xmath199 be the cycle contained in @xmath198 .",
    "it follows immediately from the convergence in distribution   that @xmath200 jointly as @xmath78 varies , where @xmath201 is the length - ranked interval partition derived from either @xmath81 or @xmath82 .",
    "this is part ( i ) of theorem  [ aldous : crl1 ] . by exchangeability considerations , before passage to the limit the bivariate sequence in   as @xmath78 varies is that in   biased by cycle - size in the cycles - first order and biased by basin - size in the basins - first ordering . hence the conclusions of parts ( ii ) and ( iii ) of theorem [ aldous : crl1 ] , by a straightforward passage to the limit .",

    "but in the basins - first ordering , this innocent looking change would spoil convergence to @xmath177 .",
