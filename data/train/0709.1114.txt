    "in the past several years h@xmath0  has been detected in diffuse interstellar clouds @xcite where it had been expected to exist in abundances below observable limits .",
    "this surprising result raised various questions about the diffuse cloud environment .",
    "the rather simple chemistry of h@xmath0  allows for only three variable parameters in determining its abundance when the steady state approximation is used : the h@xmath0-electron recombination rate , the electron to hydrogen ratio , and the cosmic - ray ionization rate .",
    "previous work @xcite has shown that the first two of these are relatively well constrained .",
    "this leaves the cosmic - ray ionization rate as an unconstrained parameter .",
    "because the low energy cosmic - rays responsible for most of the ionization in diffuse clouds can not be directly measured in the solar system , we must rely on molecules to act as tracers of the ionization rate . using h@xmath0",
    ", @xcite found the cosmic - ray ionization rate of molecular hydrogen , @xmath10 , to be much larger along the sightline to @xmath11  per than the canonical value of @xmath12  s@xmath6 .",
    "prior to the detection of h@xmath0  in diffuse clouds , oh and hd were the molecules of choice for estimating the cosmic - ray ionization rate there .",
    "estimates using these molecules required determining rate constants and modeling various reactions on the pathways to forming oh and hd @xcite .",
    "the derived values of the ionization rate tended to agree with the canonical value of @xmath4 , the primary cosmic - ray ionization rate , but differ greatly from the value derived from the recent h@xmath0  measurement toward @xmath11  per ( the relation between @xmath4 and @xmath10 is explained in   4.2 and quantified by equation ( [ eq10 ] ) ) .",
    "of the three molecules , the simple chemistry of h@xmath0  provides the most direct determination of @xmath4 @xcite , suggesting that measurements of h@xmath0  should produce more accurate results and be a more reliable tracer of the cosmic - ray ionization rate than oh or hd .",
    "the higher ionization rate found by @xcite towards @xmath11 per implies the production of more h@xmath0 , and if generally applicable , could account for the higher than expected column densities found in several diffuse clouds @xcite . however , prior to the present work the enhanced ionization rate was known to exist for certain only along one line of sight , and thus could have been considered an anomaly . to test",
    "if an enhanced ionization rate is a general property of the diffuse interstellar medium ( ism ) , we have performed a survey of h@xmath0  in nineteen diffuse cloud sightlines .",
    "h@xmath0  is detected in eight of the clouds and the overall results , including analysis of previous observations by our group , support a higher ionization rate . when coupled with further arguments",
    ", this strongly suggests that a greatly enhanced ionization rate is a typical property of the diffuse ism .",
    "all observations were made using the cgs4 spectrometer @xcite on the united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) at mauna kea .",
    "the spectrometer was used with its echelle grating , 0.6 arcsec wide slit , and long camera to provide a resolving power of 40000 .",
    "observations were taken in an abba pattern in which the target star is nodded along the slit so that the spectral image falls alternately on different rows of the array .",
    "suitable standard stars were observed throughout each night to account for changing atmospheric conditions and air mass . with the exception of the red rectangle where reddening is due to the ejected envelope of a post asymptotic giant branch star ,",
    "targets were chosen primarily by three criteria : ( 1 ) sightlines known to pass through diffuse clouds ; ( 2 ) early spectral type ; and ( 3 ) bright l - band magnitude .",
    "the complete dataset consists of twenty ( nineteen diffuse cloud ) sightlines which were observed intermittently between may 2001 and march 2005 .",
    "relevant information concerning these observations is given in table [ tbl1 ] .",
    "two of the sightlines from the dataset were examined in @xcite : hd  20041 and @xmath11  oph .",
    "however , both have previously been studied using only the @xmath13 transition at 37154.8   ( vacuum wavelengths are used throughout this paper ) , whereas the new data cover the @xmath14 and @xmath15 transitions at 36680.8    and 36685.2   , respectively ( see @xcite or @xcite for a complete description of the transition notation associated with h@xmath0 ) . @xmath11  per",
    "was investigated in @xcite , but here data from three more nights of observations are included .",
    "overall , we present twenty sightlines for which new or refined h@xmath0  column densities or upper limits are calculated .",
    "the reduction process involves multiple steps and software packages .",
    "first , raw data are run through starlink s orac - dr pipeline which processes ukirt data .",
    "images are then transformed to fits format using starlink s figaro package , and neighboring images are subtracted from each other in noao s iraf package .",
    "this subtraction serves to eliminate atmospheric background and detector bias levels from the image . still using iraf , spectra",
    "are extracted from the neighbor - subtracted images with the _ apall _ routine .",
    "these spectra are imported to igor pro where we have macros set up to complete the reduction @xcite . during this import ,",
    "ripples in the spectrum caused by guiding and seeing fluctuations while the cgs4 array is shifted along the spectral direction in successive steps of one - third of a pixel during observing are removed .",
    "spectra for each object and standard star are then coadded .",
    "some frames may be excluded in this step if they are noisier than normal or happen to have cosmic - ray hits on the rows where the spectrum is located .",
    "objects are then ratioed with standards to remove atmospheric absorption lines and the continuum level is set to unity .",
    "the ratioing is an interactive process where the user may vary the intensity scaling and/or shift the spectrum in wavelength in order to most effectively remove atmospheric lines and obtain the most reliable ratioed spectrum at the wavelengths where the h@xmath0  lines are expected to appear .",
    "a fringing pattern caused by the circular variable order - blocking filter is another artifact of cgs4 that needs to be removed .",
    "this is accomplished by transforming a spectrum into fourier space using an igor macro .",
    "the user can then find the peak caused by the fringing pattern and interpolate across it .",
    "once the peak is removed , an inverse fourier transform is performed to produce a spectrum where the fringing pattern is absent .",
    "this method is described in more depth in @xcite . after removing the fringing pattern , spectra are wavelength calibrated using the vacuum rest wavelengths of the atmospheric lines .",
    "the accuracy of the wavelength calibration is typically @xmath162  km  s@xmath6 .",
    "finally , the h@xmath0lines are fit with gaussians and the equivalent widths , column densities , and radial velocities are derived .    for targets with observations on multiple nights",
    ", the reduction process above is followed through the wavelength calibration step . at that point iraf s",
    "_ rvcorrect _ routine is used to calculate the velocity of the earth along a given sightline in the local standard of rest ( lsr ) frame . each spectrum",
    "is then shifted to be in the lsr frame .",
    "this puts the interstellar absorption lines at the same wavelength for any given date and allows spectra from different nights to be coadded .",
    "while each spectrum has its continuum set to unity , they originally had different exposure times and intensities . to weight the final coadded spectrum properly , each spectrum is scaled by its original coadded intensity before being added to the spectra from other nights .",
    "once the final multiple night coadded spectrum is produced , it is divided by the sum of the scaling factors to reset the continuum level to unity . after this process",
    ", line parameters are again extracted by fitting the absorption lines .",
    "spectra covering the h@xmath0  doublet are adversely affected by an atmospheric ch@xmath17 line complex which lies just shortward of 36680.8  , the rest wavelength of the @xmath14 line .",
    "if the spectrum of the target is blue - shifted , the overlap with this line can be significant and hinder detection or estimates of line strength .",
    "typical examples of spectra before the atmospheric lines are removed via ratioing with a standard star are shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the ch@xmath17 feature here absorbs roughly 50% of the incoming light at 36675.3    in both the standard star @xmath18  per ( middle spectrum ) and the object @xmath11  per ( bottom spectrum ) . a weak telluric hdo absorption line near 36681    that can vary with both time and airmass further complicates the reduction , especially when the water column density above the telescope is high and unstable .",
    "when the two spectra are ratioed following the methods in   2.2 , the top spectrum in figure [ fig1 ] is produced .",
    "the two lines show the rest wavelength positions of the @xmath14 line at 36680.8    and the @xmath15 line at 36685.2   .",
    "two arrows mark the expected positions of the h@xmath0  lines due the earth s orbital motion and the radial velocity of the absorbing cloud along the line of sight towards @xmath11  per .",
    "clearly the h@xmath0  absorption lines are much weaker than the atmospheric absorption lines and are barely visible at this scaling factor .",
    "this illustrates why a careful multi - step reduction process is necessary to detect h@xmath0 .",
    "the fully reduced spectra are shown in figures [ fig2]-[fig5 ] .",
    "figures [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] contain spectra from sightlines with positive h@xmath0  detections , and figures [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] show spectra from sightlines with no h@xmath0  detections or marginal detections .",
    "arrows indicate the position of the h@xmath0  doublet expected from previous measurements of the gas velocity along each line of sight .",
    "these velocities are given in table [ tbl2 ] along with the atomic or molecular species from which they were determined .",
    "in the figures the typical noise level can be judged by the peak - to - peak fluctuations in the continuum well off of the h@xmath0   lines . within several",
    "ngstrms of 36675.3   , however , the noise in the reduced spectra is several times larger than elsewhere due to the presence of the strong complex of ch@xmath17 lines , which both reduces the atmospheric transmission and emits excess background .",
    "the three spectra in figure [ fig2 ] have the strongest h@xmath0  absorption . in each case",
    "the lines match up with the arrows so we are confident in the h@xmath0  detection . in hd  20041",
    "the @xmath15 transition is clearly visible but the @xmath14 transition may have been affected by the aforementioned ch@xmath17 line .",
    "both absorption lines are clear and strong in hd  229059 . w40  irs  1a presents a somewhat confusing case because there may be either one or two velocity components .",
    "if there is one component , then the two absorption lines to longer wavelengths represent the h@xmath0  doublet and the shorter wavelength line at 36677    is a noise artifact . if there are two absorption components , then the @xmath15 transition from the shorter wavelength doublet overlaps the @xmath14 transition from the longer wavelength doublet .",
    "however , the w40  irs  1a spectrum is composed of data from two nights and on only one of those nights does the 36677    feature appear .",
    "for this reason we conclude that only the longer wavelength doublet is real .",
    "our conclusion is consistent with the observations reported by @xcite in which only one velocity component at about 8  km  s@xmath6 lsr was seen in @xmath19co emission , but does not match the 2@xmath162  km  s@xmath6 lsr reported by @xcite from @xmath20co absorption .",
    "note , however , that if the other line is real then it would correspond to a cloud with a radial velocity of about -30  km  s@xmath6 lsr , which disagrees badly with both co measurements .    in figure [ fig3 ]",
    "the absorption lines are again aligned with the arrows marking previously observed gas velocities .",
    "@xmath11  per and hd  21389 have the highest signal to noise ratios ( snr ) and their h@xmath0  lines are easily identified .",
    "the doublet in x  per is relatively clear , but the velocities found by fitting the individual line profiles differ by 2.5  km  s@xmath6 .",
    "most likely this is due to noise affecting the absorption feature . in hd  169454",
    "the @xmath15 transition of the main doublet is clear , but the @xmath14 line is rather shallow . as in the case of hd  20041 above , this may be caused by interference from the telluric ch@xmath17 line .",
    "however , the velocity we derive for the @xmath15 transition differs from the previously measured cloud velocity by about 3.2  km  s@xmath6 .",
    "because of the different velocities and the lack of a clear @xmath14 line , we are not as confident as in the previous cases that these features represent h@xmath0  absorption , but still consider it a positive detection .",
    "the shorter arrows above the hd  169454 spectrum mark the expected location of the h@xmath0  doublet for a high velocity component at 90  km  s@xmath6 reported by @xcite .",
    "our spectrum may indicate absorption features at this velocity , but further integration time is needed to determine if the features are real .",
    "the absorption features in bd  -14  5037 both appear to be double peaked , although the signal - to - noise ratio of each double peak is low .",
    "it also seems that there are small absorption features on the shorter wavelength shoulders of the main features .",
    "two velocity components reported by @xcite match well with the centers of the double peaked features and the shoulder features , making the detections more believable .",
    "there is no definitive evidence for h@xmath0  absorption lines in any spectrum in figure [ fig4 ] , with the possible exception of @xmath21  per .",
    "the arrow marking the @xmath15 transition of h@xmath0  in @xmath21  per matches rather well with a statistically significant absorption feature in the spectrum .",
    "however , at the expected wavelength of the @xmath14 line the absorption is too weak to attempt a fit given the noise level . both @xmath22  per and @xmath23  per show some amount of absorption near the wavelengths where the h@xmath0  lines are expected , but nothing that can be conclusively identified as a detection .",
    "the red rectangle and @xmath11  oph sightlines both have a very high snr . with these clean spectra and no h@xmath0  absorption ,",
    "it is possible to derive strict upper limits .",
    "hd  147889 , 40  per , and @xmath21  sco all have no significant absorption features close to the expected wavelengths .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] contains two non - detections in spectra with typical noise levels ( hd  168625 and @xmath24  cep ) and two with high noise levels ( hd  21483 and 62  tau ) .",
    "by fitting the absorption lines in the spectra with gaussians we are able to obtain the line of sight velocity , full width at half maximum , equivalent width , and the h@xmath0  column density and its uncertainty .",
    "values for these parameters along all of the observed sightlines are given in table [ tbl3 ] .",
    "using these values in concert with the steady state approximation and a few reasonable assumptions allows for the calculation of other physical parameters of the diffuse clouds along these lines of sight .      below are the three reactions which describe the dominant creation and destruction processes for h@xmath0",
    ". reactions ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) show the formation process , while reaction ( [ eq3 ] ) shows destruction .",
    "@xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27    first , h@xmath28 is ionized to produce h@xmath29 and an electron .",
    "this ionization is assumed to be due to a cosmic - ray because @xcite showed that low energy cosmic - rays will penetrate diffuse clouds while the x - ray flux is attenuated in a thin layer at the cloud exterior .",
    "they find that for an x - ray with energy 100  ev the optical depth of the cloud reaches unity at an h@xmath28 column density of @xmath30 @xmath2 .",
    "because most of our sightlines have column densities much larger than this we assume that cosmic - rays are the only ionization mechanism operating throughout the majority of the cloud . after being ionized",
    "the h@xmath29 ion reacts with h@xmath28 to produce h@xmath0  and h. the second step is many orders of magnitude faster than the first step @xcite , so the formation rate of h@xmath0  is proportional to the product of the ionization rate and h@xmath28 density . in diffuse clouds the primary channel of h@xmath0",
    "destruction is electron recombination , which results in either three h atoms or one h atom and one h@xmath28 molecule .",
    "the destruction rate is given by a rate constant times the product of the number densities of h@xmath0  and electrons .",
    "the steady state approximation assumes that the formation and destruction rates of h@xmath0  are equal .",
    "this approximation yields the equation @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32(x ) is the number density of species x , @xmath10 is the ionization rate of h@xmath28 , and @xmath33 is the h@xmath0-electron recombination rate constant .",
    "in contrast to the steady state approximation , time dependent models developed by @xcite showed that the abundance of h@xmath0  is only weakly dependent on the cosmic - ray ionization rate when a cloud is young .",
    "this age is quantified by the ratio of molecular hydrogen to atomic hydrogen @xmath34 where smaller values correspond to younger clouds .",
    "the h@xmath0  abundance becomes weakly dependent on the cosmic - ray ionization rate when @xmath35 .",
    "this value corresponds to a molecular hydrogen fraction ( defined below in equation ( [ eq6 ] ) ) of @xmath36 .",
    "because the h@xmath28 fractions in all of the clouds we observed are more than double this value , we neglect time dependence and use the steady state approximation .    assuming that gas is uniformly distributed in the cloud , we can substitute the column density divided by the path length for the number density . by doing this and solving for the ionization rate",
    "we obtain @xmath37 we further assume that nearly all hydrogen is either in the atomic or molecular state , and define the molecular hydrogen fraction ( the fraction of hydrogen nuclei in molecular form ) as @xmath38 where the denominator is the number density of hydrogen nuclei , @xmath39 . solving for @xmath40 and plugging the result back into the ionization rate equation we find @xmath41 in this form it is possible to measure or estimate all of the variables on the right hand side of the equation ,",
    "so we can derive values for the ionization rate of molecular hydrogen .",
    "the electron recombination rate constant is given by the equation @xmath42 from @xcite which is valid when the electron temperature , @xmath43 , is between 10 k and 4000 k. while @xmath43 is not directly measured , it can be approximated by the excitation temperature derived from the @xmath44 and @xmath45 levels of molecular hydrogen , @xmath46 .",
    "this temperature is calculated from measurements of the column densities of the two levels . in sightlines without these measurements we adopt a value of 60  k. the fact that the observed lines of the @xmath44 and @xmath45 levels of h@xmath28 are saturated indicates that few photons are present in the interior of diffuse clouds to radiatively pump these levels .",
    "this means that collisions will dominate the equilibrium between these levels .",
    "however , the @xmath44 and @xmath45 levels of h@xmath28 have different nuclear spin configurations and thus require collisions with species such as h@xmath47 or h@xmath0  to interconvert @xcite .",
    "if collisions with protons are the dominant factor in determining the relative population of the @xmath44 and @xmath45 levels though , then @xmath46 should represent the proton kinetic temperature and thus the kinetic temperature of the gas in general @xcite .",
    "while electrons produced by photoionization may begin with much higher temperatures , they should thermalize quickly via collisions with h@xmath28 @xcite .",
    "because @xmath43 and @xmath46 should both nearly equal the kinetic temperature of the gas , we substitute @xmath46 for @xmath43 in equation ( [ eq8 ] ) .",
    "assuming that nearly all electrons in diffuse clouds are produced via the ionization of c to c@xmath47 and that nearly all atomic carbon has been singly ionized @xcite , the carbon to hydrogen ratio should approximate the electron to hydrogen ratio .",
    "@xcite found this value to be about @xmath48 in multiple diffuse clouds . because of the relative uniformity of this ratio in all six of their sightlines , we adopt a single average value for use in all of our calculations .",
    "the molecular hydrogen fraction is dependent on h and h@xmath28 number densities , quantities which surely vary through the cloud , but whose variations are not readily measurable . because fluctuations in number density can not be directly measured , we use column densities in place of the number densities in equation ( [ eq6 ] ) and calculate what @xcite refer to as @xmath49 in clouds where we have measurements of the h and h@xmath28 column densities .",
    "however , @xmath49 is most likely an underestimate of @xmath50 in the more molecular regions of the cloud which contain higher concentrations of h@xmath0 .",
    "this is because atomic hydrogen is more widely distributed than molecular hydrogen and column densities measure material along the entire line of sight @xcite .",
    "since the measurement of @xmath51(h ) includes material not associated with h@xmath28 , @xmath49 underestimates the h@xmath28 fraction in the molecular region . for sightlines where",
    "measurements are lacking we use @xmath52 , the value for which the column densities of h and h@xmath28 are equal .",
    "when possible , estimates of the number density of hydrogen nuclei , @xmath39 , are adopted from the literature based on various atomic and molecular diagnostics . in eleven of our sightlines",
    "@xcite used the observed rotational excitation of c@xmath28 to infer the sum of the h and h@xmath28 number densities .",
    "this was done by comparing models with various temperatures and number densities to the measured column densities of all the excited states and choosing the best fit . for sightlines where the average value of @xmath50 is known , they converted @xmath53 to @xmath39 . for sightlines where @xmath50 is not known ,",
    "our adopted value of @xmath52 is used to perform the conversion . in two additional cases @xcite",
    "measured column densities of h and the @xmath54 excited level of h@xmath28 , and with some assumptions estimated the product @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the rate at which h@xmath28 forms on grains . adopting a typical value for @xmath56 then allowed for the computation of @xmath39 . in one more sightline ( 40 per ) @xcite estimated the thermal pressure from measurements of the @xmath44 , 1 , and 2 fine - structure levels of c for a kinetic temperature of 80  k. using this pressure estimate and the h@xmath28 temperature ( @xmath57  k ) , we calculate @xmath39 . unfortunately , the results obtained for a given sightline by using each of these methods can be significantly different . for example , in the sightline toward @xmath11 oph",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite derived values of 215  @xmath58 , 90  @xmath58 , and 117  @xmath58 , respectively for @xmath39 . because of the uncertainties involved with each method and the different final results , the number densities we use are probably uncertain by about a factor of two . for cases where no number density has been determined ,",
    "a value of 250 @xmath58 is adopted .    again assuming a uniform distribution of gas in each cloud",
    ", we divide the total hydrogen column densities by these number densities to obtain pathlengths : @xmath59 in sightlines where no h and h@xmath28 column densities have been determined , the total hydrogen column density is estimated from the color excess and the relation @xmath60  @xmath2 @xcite . as the pathlength",
    "is calculated directly from the hydrogen number density , it is also uncertain by about a factor of two . using the above relations and approximations , we calculate the ionization rate of molecular hydrogen , @xmath10 .",
    "however , most studies examine the primary cosmic - ray ionization rate per hydrogen atom , @xmath4 . while the ionization efficiencies of h and h@xmath28 are dependent on factors such as the helium abundance and ratio of molecular to atomic hydrogen @xcite",
    ", we adopt a more simplified approach and use the conversion factor given by @xcite : @xmath61 this conversion stems from the fact that h@xmath28 contains two hydrogen atoms , so the ionization rate is nearly twice as high . also , @xmath4 only accounts for the initial ( primary ) cosmic - ray ionization while @xmath10 includes ionization from energetic secondary electrons which were created in the first ionization event . with equation ( [ eq10 ] )",
    "we convert our values of @xmath10 to @xmath4 so that they can be directly compared to previous observations .",
    "the resulting values for the primary cosmic - ray ionization rate and the specific estimates used for each sightline are shown in table [ tbl4 ] . for completeness",
    ", we have performed the same analysis for ten sightlines from @xcite and also included the results in table [ tbl4 ] .    with all of the assumptions we have made , it is important to investigate the uncertainties that will propagate to the cosmic - ray ionization rate .",
    "substituting equations ( [ eq9 ] ) and ( [ eq10 ] ) into equation ( [ eq7 ] ) gives the primary cosmic - ray ionization rate as    @xmath62 .",
    "\\label{eq11}\\ ] ]    in this equation , the molecular hydrogen fraction , @xmath50 , and the number density of hydrogen nuclei , @xmath39 , are the two most uncertain parameters ( note that the @xmath39 in the denominator is part of the ratio @xmath63 which is well determined ) .",
    "because @xmath4 is directly proportional to @xmath39 , any increase or decrease in @xmath39 produces a corresponding increase or decrease in @xmath4 .",
    "as previously mentioned , the uncertainty in @xmath39 is probably about a factor of 2 .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath4 is inversely related to @xmath50 .",
    "the h@xmath28 fraction is by definition between zero and one , and most of our measured values are around 0.5 . for sightlines with the adopted value of 0.67 ,",
    "the maximum increase is a factor of 1.5 .",
    "we take this factor to be an approximation for the uncertainty in @xmath50 . because @xmath49 should always be an underestimate of @xmath50 in measured sightlines , we only consider increasing the molecular hydrogen fraction for those sightlines . taking into account the uncertainties in both @xmath39 and @xmath50 ,",
    "the true value of @xmath4 in sightlines with measurements of @xmath49 is likely between one third and twice our derived estimate of @xmath4 . for sightlines with no measured h@xmath28 fraction , we allow @xmath50 to vary both up or down by a factor of 1.5 .",
    "this results in a possible cosmic - ray ionization rate between @xmath4/3 and 3@xmath4 .",
    "these limits arise when the most extreme variations in both @xmath50 and @xmath39 are substituted into equation ( [ eq11 ] ) .",
    "however , @xmath50 tends to be higher when @xmath39 is higher because the rate of h@xmath28 formation scales as the square of @xmath39 .",
    "this suggests that it is probable that @xmath50 and @xmath39 will vary in the same way , so that the above analysis most likely overestimates the range of possible ionization rates .",
    "another property of the gas to be examined is the excitation temperature , determined from relative populations of the different rotational states of h@xmath0 .",
    "for the two lines we have observed the temperature may be determined from the equation @xmath64 taken from @xcite . in this case _",
    "ortho _ refers to the population of the ( 1,0 ) state and _ para _ to the ( 1,1 ) state .",
    "the @xmath65 s are statistical weights , @xmath66 is the energy difference between the states , @xmath67 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath68 is the temperature .",
    "excitation temperatures derived from this equation are shown in table [ tbl4 ] .",
    "if the rotational ( de-)excitation of h@xmath0  is dominated by collisions with h@xmath28 , then the temperature measurements from both species should be similar . however , this is not the case .",
    "most h@xmath28 temperatures are around 60  k while the h@xmath0  temperatures are typically about 30  k. this same discrepancy was described by @xcite . in their model calculation of h@xmath0  thermalization , @xcite have shown that the ( 1,1)/(1,0 ) excitation temperature is always lower than the h@xmath28 temperature because of cooling by fast spontaneous emission from the ( 2,2 ) to ( 1,1 ) state .",
    "for the typical cloud conditions in this paper ( @xmath69  @xmath58 , @xmath70  k ) the model of @xcite produces an h@xmath0  excitation temperature of about 50 - 55  k which is significantly higher than the observed values of about 30  k. the source of this discrepancy remains unclear .",
    "values of the cosmic - ray ionization rate for diffuse clouds observed here as well as those determined for other diffuse clouds observed previously by us are given in the right hand column of table [ tbl4 ] .",
    "the detected values in the lines of sight to fourteen sources cover the range 0.53.2@xmath71  s@xmath6 .",
    "upper limits , which are given for fifteen diffuse clouds , are consistent with this range of ionization rates , with the possible exception of hd  168607 . while most of the detections of h@xmath0  are confined to the galactic plane , they are widely dispersed in galactic longitude . we therefore conclude that the values of the cosmic - ray ionization rate listed in table [ tbl4 ] are typical for galactic diffuse interstellar clouds .",
    "a few of the sightlines we investigated have been studied previously to derive cosmic - ray ionization rates .",
    "all of these studies used column densities of either oh , hd , or both in their calculations . because the formation pathways of oh and hd include the ionization of atomic hydrogen , they can be used to determine the h ionization rate .",
    "most of these studies @xcite then derived the primary cosmic - ray ionization rate from the h ionization rate , but @xcite did not because they still considered ionization via x - rays to be important .",
    "our values of the primary ionization rate for @xmath11  per , @xmath21  per , @xmath23  per , @xmath22  per , and @xmath11  oph are shown in table [ tbl5 ] along with the rates derived from oh and hd measurements as well as cloud modeling . for @xmath11  per our value",
    "is over an order of magnitude larger than those reported by @xcite and @xcite . while the rest of our new measurements in table [ tbl5 ] are only upper limits , these are also typically orders of magnitude larger than previously published values .",
    "the only exception is @xmath21  per where both papers cite values of @xmath4 about one fourth to one half our upper limit .",
    "various model calculations were performed by @xcite to investigate three of the sightlines that we study here : @xmath11  oph , @xmath11  per , and @xmath21  per . in creating these models they used the most recent measurements of rate constants and the column densities of diagnostic species such as h and h@xmath28 as input parameters . by varying a few uncertain parameters",
    ", they would then generate lists of predicted column densities for many atomic and molecular species under slightly different conditions . when their paper was written , it was believed that the h@xmath0-electron recombination rate constant was much lower than the currently accepted value .",
    "@xcite reported an upper limit correspnding to @xmath72  @xmath73  s@xmath6 at @xmath74  k , and @xcite lowered the upper limit to @xmath75  @xmath73  s@xmath6 at @xmath76  k. due to the wide range of possible recombination rate constants , @xcite performed calculations using both @xmath72 and @xmath77  @xmath73  s@xmath6 .",
    "the cosmic - ray ionization rates from their paper listed in table [ tbl5 ] were computed by determining @xmath4 necessary to reproduce observed oh column densities when @xmath78 @xmath73 s@xmath6 .",
    "we choose to compare these ionization rates to ours because we obtain @xmath79 @xmath73 s@xmath6 when @xmath80 k is used as the input temperature in equation ( [ eq8 ] ) .",
    "the value of @xmath4 inferred by @xcite is about the same as ours for @xmath11  per , but the lower limits they derived for @xmath11  oph and @xmath21 per are larger than our upper limits for both of those sightlines .    for their models that used @xmath81 @xmath73 s@xmath6 ,",
    "@xcite obtained cosmic - ray ionization rates that are about a factor of 1 to 5 times smaller than ours . from these models they also predicted the column density of h@xmath0  along each sightline .",
    "their results are all on the order of @xmath51(h@xmath0 )  @xmath82 @xmath2 , which is a few times larger than the observed column densities or upper limits in any of these sightlines . because @xcite use only a slightly smaller cosmic - ray ionization rate ( corresponding to the formation rate ) but a much smaller recombination rate ( corresponding to the destruction rate ) , their prediction of an h@xmath0  column density similar to observed values seems somewhat serendipitous .",
    "in addition to the overestimate of the h@xmath0  column density , a small h@xmath0-electron recombination rate constant may have further consequences .",
    "@xcite noted that a small value of @xmath33 may have been responsible for underestimates of the primary cosmic - ray ionization rate in the past .",
    "this is because a slower destruction rate requires a slower formation rate to produce a given abundance .",
    "in addition to the slow recombination rate , there are some other possible explanations for differences between the cosmic - ray ionization rate inferred from h@xmath0  and those inferred from oh and hd .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the rate constant associated with the endothermic charge transfer from h@xmath47 to o varies over the temperatures typically associated with diffuse clouds .",
    "this means that the oh production rate is temperature dependent .",
    "the ionization rates towards @xmath11 per and @xmath11 oph quoted in @xcite were derived using temperatures of 120 k and 110 k , respectively , for the warm components of the cloud models along each sightline @xcite . as these temperatures are about twice as large as the values determined from h@xmath28 , their oh production is much more efficient .",
    "the result is a smaller cosmic - ray ionization rate needed to produce the observed oh column density than if a lower temperature had been used .",
    "this problem was addressed by the later models of @xcite where tempertaure and density were varied as functions of cloud depth .",
    "@xcite went on to make a comprehensive chemical model of the cloud towards @xmath11  per .",
    "they determined the value of @xmath4 that would best reproduce all observed atomic and molecular column densities to be @xmath83 s@xmath6 , which is in good agreement with our estimate of @xmath84 s@xmath6 .",
    "the difference in these values may arise because we assume a uniform distribution of gas while @xcite invoke a three phase model which includes diffuse gas , dense gas , and magnetohydrodynamic shocks .",
    "two different effects may lead to underestimates of @xmath4 from measurements of hd .",
    "the first has to do with an overestimate of the total deuterium to hydrogen ratio @xmath85/@xmath39 .",
    "this ratio can be used to estimate the molecular deuterium fraction , @xmath86 . however , the observed values of @xmath86 are about an order of magnitude smaller than those predicted by @xmath85/@xmath39 . to explain this discrepancy",
    ", @xcite argued that the atomic deuterium fraction must be larger than the total deuterium fraction .",
    "this means that approximating @xmath85/@xmath39 with @xmath87 overestimates the total deuterium to hydrogen ratio .",
    "@xcite showed that the cosmic - ray ionization rate is inversely related to the deuterium fraction , so an overestimate of @xmath85/@xmath39 will underestimate @xmath4 .",
    "secondly , @xcite emphasized the importance of grain neutralization proposed by @xcite .",
    "this process reduces the number of h@xmath47 ions in the gas through charge transfer with small grains . by lowering the abundance of h@xmath47 , the production rate of hd will decrease .",
    "this is because hd formation is dependent upon the reaction involving the charge transfer from h@xmath47 to d. since neutralization slows down hd production , a larger value of @xmath4 is needed to create a given abundance than if the effect were not taken into account .",
    "@xcite used a model which includes grain neutralization and showed that both h@xmath0  and hd column densities can be reproduced with a single ionization rate of @xmath88 s@xmath6 .",
    "since oh formation is dependent on a similar charge transfer reaction , grain neutralization and thus a larger cosmic - ray ionization rate may be necessary in its analysis as well .",
    "@xcite studied h@xmath0  in the sightline towards @xmath11  per .",
    "using nearly the same analysis as this paper , they inferred a value of @xmath89  s@xmath6 which is equivalent to @xmath90  s@xmath6 shown in table [ tbl5 ] .",
    "this higher ionization rate is due to various differences in input parameters . in terms of the parameters in this paper , @xcite used 1.5@xmath33 , 1.2@xmath51(h@xmath0 ) , 1.2@xmath39 , and 0.8@xmath63 for the following reasons . the h@xmath0-electron recombination rate constant differs because they approximated the electron temperature with the h@xmath0  temperature instead of the h@xmath28 temperature in equation ( [ eq8 ] ) .",
    "further observations have more than doubled the total integration time so that the spectrum and h@xmath0  column density change slightly between papers .",
    "the value of @xmath39 used by @xcite was an average number density computed from various measurements , whereas the value used in this paper comes from the c@xmath28 analysis of @xcite .",
    "finally , we have adopted a single value of @xmath63 to be used in all calculations while they used h@xmath28 and c@xmath47 column densities measured towards @xmath11  per .",
    "while all of the observations and models above are viable methods for finding the cosmic - ray ionization rate , we believe that the use of h@xmath0  should produce the best results due to its relatively simple chemistry . using either oh or hd to calculate @xmath4 requires more measurements , more assumptions , and more variable parameters than using h@xmath0 .",
    "more parameters give the opportunity for a greater uncertainty to accumulate during the calculation .",
    "fewer uncertainties coupled with advances in instrumentation lead us to speculate that the cosmic - ray ionization rates inferred from h@xmath0  may be the most accurate to date for diffuse clouds .",
    "however , improved estimates of @xmath50 and @xmath39 , the two most uncertain values in our calculations , would make h@xmath0  an even better probe of the cosmic - ray ionization rate .",
    "several theoretical calculations of @xmath4 have been performed in the last half - century @xcite . in these papers",
    "the authors derived a cosmic - ray ionization rate starting from the observed flux of cosmic - rays in our solar system .",
    "unfortunately , there are large uncertainties associated with this method .",
    "the cosmic - ray spectrum is well measured above about 1  gev , but lower energy particles are deflected from the inner solar system by the magnetic field coupled to the solar wind .",
    "the particles which are most important for ionizing species in diffuse clouds are likely those with energies from about 2 to 10  mev .",
    "since this portion of the spectrum can not be directly measured , the flux at low energies must somehow be extrapolated from existing data .",
    "@xcite assumed that the power law which applies to the flux of high energy cosmic - rays continues down to 10 mev where the spectrum peaks and then decreases linearly with energy . from these assumptions they derived an ionization rate of @xmath91  s@xmath6 .",
    "@xcite , however , fit a curve to measurements of cosmic - rays with energies near 100  mev that also matches the high energy spectrum power law . with this method ,",
    "their spectrum peaks around 100 mev and falls off for lower energies .",
    "the result of using their fit is a lower limit of @xmath92  s@xmath6 . in the same paper they derived an upper limit of @xmath93  s@xmath6 via arguments that low energy cosmic - ray protons are accelerated in type  i supernova shells .",
    "@xcite used data from the _ pioneer _ and _ voyager _ spacecraft as they travelled outward in the solar system where the weaker solar wind allows for the detection of lower - energy cosmic - rays .",
    "these data were then combined with previous observations to infer the interstellar proton spectrum . using this proton spectrum and a heavy nuclei spectrum both with low energy cut - offs at 10  mev and an electron spectrum cut - off below 2  mev , @xcite calculated the primary cosmic - ray ionization rate to be @xmath94 s@xmath6 .",
    "our ionization rates fall neatly within the bounds formed by these studies and so are not inconsistent with constraints based on direct cosmic - ray measurements and theoretical particle physics .",
    "in contrast to our findings in diffuse clouds , the cosmic - ray ionization rate in dense clouds does seem to agree with the canonical value .",
    "observations of h@xmath0  towards dense clouds have found column densities roughly the same as those seen in diffuse clouds @xcite .",
    "these measurements have been used to calculate the product @xmath95 .",
    "when @xmath10 is taken to be the canonical value of @xmath12  s@xmath6 , the resulting pathlength is on the order of a parsec .",
    "this is a typical size for dense clouds as measured by other methods such as extinction mapping .",
    "since h@xmath0should be a reliable tracer for the cosmic - ray ionization rate in both environments , there must be some mechanism causing the difference between dense and diffuse clouds .",
    "one possibility examined by both @xcite and @xcite is cosmic - ray self - confinement . in this process",
    "cosmic - rays generate alfvn waves which can effectively confine the lower energy particles ( @xmath96  mev ) to diffuse material , thus preventing them from entering dense clouds . because cosmic - rays in the 1100  mev range are the most efficient at ionization , self - confinement naturally leads to a higher ionization rate in diffuse clouds than in dense clouds .",
    "another possibility is that there is a previously unrecognized high flux of low energy cosmic - rays that can penetrate diffuse but not dense clouds . assuming that typical column densities of diffuse clouds are of order @xmath97  @xmath2 and those of dense clouds are of order @xmath98  @xmath2 , cosmic - rays with energies @xmath99220 mev @xcite would contribute to the ionization rate only in diffuse clouds .",
    "as we foresee no observational techniques that would distinguish between these two possibilities , a resolution to this question will depend on more sophisticated theoretical treatments .",
    "we have surveyed twenty sightlines and detected h@xmath0  along eight of them .",
    "column densities are measured for these eight sightlines , and upper limits set for the remaining twelve .",
    "besides a concentration near the galactic plane , there seems to be no clear correlation between location in the sky and detecting h@xmath0 , so it is unlikely that we are observing anomalous regions in the galaxy .",
    "instead , finding h@xmath0  in so many sightlines suggests that it is ubiquitous in the diffuse ism .    from the h@xmath0  column densities and the steady state approximation",
    ", we derive cosmic - ray ionization rates for the nineteen diffuse cloud sightlines in this study along with ten sightlines from @xcite .",
    "typical values are on the order of @xmath100 s@xmath6 , which falls within theoretical constraints .",
    "while this is an order of magnitude larger than most previously inferred values , there are several possible explanations for the discrepancy .",
    "the most likely candidates are rate constants with uncertain measurements and physical or chemical effects not included in past models .",
    "newer models that do take into account these factors require cosmic - ray ionization rates very similar to our inferred values . coupled with these models ,",
    "our widespread detection of h@xmath0  in diffuse clouds supports the idea that the typical cosmic - ray ionization rate in such regions should be revised upward by about an order of magnitude .",

    "<S> using high resolution infrared spectroscopy we have surveyed twenty sightlines for h@xmath0   absorption . </S>",
    "<S> h@xmath0  is detected in eight diffuse cloud sightlines with column densities varying from @xmath1  @xmath2 to @xmath3  @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this brings to fourteen the total number of diffuse cloud sightlines where h@xmath0  has been detected . </S>",
    "<S> these detections are mostly along sightlines concentrated in the galactic plane , but well dispersed in galactic longitude . </S>",
    "<S> the results imply that abundant h@xmath0  is common in the diffuse interstellar medium . </S>",
    "<S> because of the simple chemistry associated with h@xmath0  production and destruction , these column density measurements can be used in concert with various other data to infer the primary cosmic - ray ionization rate , @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> values range from @xmath5  s@xmath6 to @xmath7  s@xmath6 with an average of @xmath8  s@xmath6 . where h@xmath0  is not detected the upper limits on the ionization rate are consistent with this range . </S>",
    "<S> the average value of @xmath4 is about an order of magnitude larger than both the canonical rate and rates previously reported by other groups using measurements of oh and hd . </S>",
    "<S> the discrepancy is most likely due to inaccurate measurements of rate constants and the omission of effects which were unknown when those studies were performed . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that the observed column density of h@xmath0  is the most direct tracer for the cosmic - ray ionization rate due to its simple chemistry . </S>",
    "<S> recent models of diffuse cloud chemistry require cosmic - ray ionization rates on the order of 10@xmath9  s@xmath6 to reproduce observed abundances of various atomic and molecular species , in rough accord with our observational findings . </S>"
