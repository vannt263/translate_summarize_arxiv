    "mercury is the target of two current space missions ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the first one , messenger ( nasa ) , already performed three flybys on january 14 , october 6 , 2008 , and september 29 , 2009 , before orbit insertion in march 2011 .",
    "the second one , bepicolombo ( esa / jaxa ) , is planned to be launched in 2014 and to reach mercury in 2020 .",
    "the preparation of these two missions motivated an in - depth study of the rotation of mercury .",
    "the rotation of mercury is a unique case in the solar system because of its @xmath0 spin - orbit resonance , mercury performing exactly 3 rotations during 2 revolutions about the sun @xcite .",
    "it corresponds to an equilibrium state @xcite known as cassini state 1 .",
    "recently , radar earth - based measurements by @xcite detected a 88-day longitudinal libration of mercury with an amplitude @xmath1 of @xmath2 arcsec .",
    "this amplitude being nearly twice too high to be consistent with a rigid mercury , it is the signature of an at least partially molten core .",
    "if we consider mercury as a 2-layered body with a rigid mantle and a spherical liquid core that does not follow the short - period ( @xmath3 days ) excitations and does not interact with the mantle , we can derive from this amplitude the inertia of the mantle plus crust .",
    "in particular , naming @xmath4 the inertial polar momentum of the mantle and @xmath5 the inertial momenta of mercury , we have @xcite :    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is a second - degree coefficient of the gravitational potential of mercury , @xmath8 its mass , @xmath9 its radius , and @xmath10 its orbital eccentricity .",
    "it leads to @xmath11 with @xmath12 .",
    "if we take @xmath13 @xcite and @xmath14 @xcite we get @xmath15 .",
    "recent studies in one @xcite and two @xcite degrees of freedom have theoretically estimated the longitudinal librations of mercury .",
    "they highlighted in particular the possibility of a resonance with the jovian perturbation , whose period is @xmath16 years , that could potentially raise the amplitude of a long - term ( @xmath17 years ) libration .",
    "other periodic terms of a few arcsec have been estimated .",
    "this model also predicts that the latitudinal motion of mercury should adiabatically follow the cassini state 1 ( @xcite , @xcite ) , with short - period librations of about 10 milli - arcsec @xcite . in all these studies ,",
    "the core - mantle interactions are neglected .",
    "recently , @xcite explored the dynamics of the rotation of mercury , including core - mantle interactions in the sonyr model @xcite .",
    "we here propose an alternative study , starting from the hamiltonian formulation of @xcite and highlighting the dynamical implications of core - mantle interactions , by considering mercury as composed of a rigid mantle and a triaxial ellipsoidal cavity filled with inviscid fluid of constant uniform density and vorticity .",
    "the differential equations ruling the motion of a 2-layered body with a rigid mantle and a liquid non - spherical core have been derived by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite gave a hamiltonian formulation of this problem , that @xcite applied to the rotational dynamics of io , assuming that the core and the mantle were aligned and proportional .",
    "here , we generalize the model of henrard , allowing the core to be non - proportional and non - spherical .      [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     we see on this table the overwhelming predominance of the @xmath18-d contribution , i.e. the rotational period .",
    "as expected , it is excited by the proximity of the @xmath19 secondary resonance with the proper frequency @xmath20 .",
    "we can see that the amplitude associated is roughly the mean value of @xmath21 as can be read from figure [ fig : polarcore ] ( @xmath22 arcsec = @xmath23 arcmin ) .",
    "we also note some similarities with the precession of the rotation axis of the mantle ( table [ tab : polarmantle ] ) , the frequencies involved being the same ones .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the 4-degree of freedom behaviour of a rotating mercury composed of a rigid mantle and a fluid ellipsoidal core , using both analytical and numerical tools with good agreement .",
    "we have emphasized the influence of the proximity of a resonance with the spin of mercury , that can raise the velocity field of the fluid constituting the core .",
    "we can not exclude a possibility of indirect detection of this effect by measuring mercury s magnetic field .",
    "we have also shown the variations of the behaviour of the obliquity of the mantle with respect to the polar flattening of the core , this flattening being linked with the distance of the system from the resonance .",
    "these variations should be negligible unless the core is trapped into the resonance with the spin of mercury .",
    "we have also shown that neither the observations of the longitudinal motion of mercury , nor of its polar one , could be inverted to get the shape of the core .",
    "however , they will give information on its size ( i.e. the parameter @xmath24 ) .",
    "future works should take the viscosity of the fluid into account .",
    "it is assumed to alter the response of the core of mercury to slow ( i.e. @xmath25-year period ) excitations , the planet being therefore assumed as rigid . as a consequence ,",
    "a study of the spectral response of the rotation of mercury on periodic solicitations with respect to the viscosity is worth studying .",
    "this study benefited from the financial support of the contract prodex c90253 `` romeo '' from belspo .",
    "benot noyelles was also supported by the agenzia spaziale italiana ( asi grant `` studi di esplorazione del sistema solare '' ) , and thanks alessandra celletti and luciano iess for their reception in rome .",
