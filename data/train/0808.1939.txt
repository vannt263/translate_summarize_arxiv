    "both @xmath1-body simulations @xcite and analytical methods ( kalnajs 1978 ; jalali & hunter 2005 , hereafter jh ) show that global instabilities can generate barred structures in galactic disks .",
    "apart from the bar mode , which is an isolated event in frequency space , global spiral modes seen in the eigenspectra of cored stellar disks ( jalali 2007 , hereafter paper i ) constitute a discrete family that bifurcates form stationary @xcite modes .",
    "but not all spiral structures are global modes as disturbances induced by close neighbors @xcite and density inhomogeneities @xcite may also create the spiral patterns of the observed galaxies .",
    "a mode of a stellar disk is a mathematical entity that comes out of an eigenvalue problem .",
    "however , its physical origin in isolated systems has not yet been understood clearly .",
    "lynden - bell & kalnajs ( 1972 , hereafter lbk ) attempted to explain a mode through the transport of angular momentum between different parts of the disk .",
    "they suggested that the inner lindblad resonance ( ilr ) releases the angular momentum of central regions and the spiral structure transports it to the outer parts through the corotation ( cr ) and outer lindblad resonances ( olr ) .",
    "this mechanism is favored by some galactic dynamicists @xcite , but it is seriously challenged by toomre s ( 1981 ) theory that says that feedback through the galactic center is a critical ingredient for growing modes . in toomre s theory , on the other hand , the modeling of feedback as the reflection of a leading spiral wave at the galactic center and its emergence as a trailing one , is a simple description of a very complicated dynamics that governs the motions of stars .",
    "unresolved issues concerning the evolution of unstable modes include the following : ( i ) the swing amplification theory is not capable of predicting the fate of a growing mode against other stationary and unstable modes that coexist in the eigenspectrum of a given model .",
    "( ii ) how does the bar mode saturate ? @xcite .",
    "( iii ) why does the nonlinear bar terminate almost at the corotation radius ?",
    "( iv ) we should also understand the origin of different species in an eigenspectrum and interpret their continuous or discrete nature , and the distribution of their pattern speeds and growth rates .",

    "i use the results of paper i and introduce a new dynamical mechanism that sparks unstable modes and governs the singular oscillations of @xcite modes . resolving the origin of instabilities and amplitude saturation precede my nonlinear calculations , which were made feasible in paper i by the petrov - galerkin method and reducing the cbe to a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations . those reduced equations , however ,",

    "i select modes b1 and s2 as my case studies of sections [ sec : mode - decomposition ] through [ sec : perturbed - stellar - dynamics ] .",
    "the reason for choosing mode s2 is its extensive and prominent spiral structure and modest growth rate . in section [ sec : mode - saturation ] , i will also display some results for modes s1 , s3 and s6 .",
    "one of the advantages of the method developed in paper i is that the density function of a mode can be readily decomposed to its constituent fourier components in angle - action space .",
    "the phase shifts between density components determine the magnitude and direction of the torque that is exerted on each component .",
    "so we can probe the transfer of angular momentum and identify the direction of its flow once a global mode develops .",
    "the perturbed distribution and hamiltonian functions of an unstable mode can be expanded as ( paper i ) @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the angle and action variables , respectively .",

    "@xmath7 and @xmath55 are the pattern speed and growth rate of an unstable mode of angular wavenumber @xmath8 . on the other hand",

    "equation ( [ eq : total - torque ] ) is analogous to equation ( b6 ) in jh and @xmath79 shows the rate of angular momentum flow into / from the @xmath80th fourier component ( in the radial angle @xmath81 ) whose corresponding density in the configuration space is @xmath82 the angular momentum conservation of the disk implies that some @xmath79 take negative and some other positive values with a total vanishing sum .",
    "this means that @xmath83 , the pattern corresponding to @xmath79 , is subject to a positive torque from other components if @xmath84 , and a negative torque otherwise .",
    "figure [ pic : ang - momentum - modes - b1-s2 ] shows the variation of @xmath85 versus @xmath80 for modes b1 and s2 .",
    "the results are in accordance with the bar charts of jh : components with @xmath86 lose angular momentum and those with @xmath87 gain it . as jh had already pointed out",
    ", a few components ensure the convergence of fourier series in the @xmath81-direction .",
    "the superposition of the @xmath87 components of the perturbed density , defined as @xmath88 will thus be a pattern that experiences a positive torque exerted by @xmath89 in response , the reaction torque of @xmath90 will drain the angular momentum of @xmath91 so that @xmath73 is conserved .",
    "figure [ pic : components - modes - b1-s2 ] shows modes b1 and s2 and their components that emit and absorb angular momentum .",
    "it is seen that in both modes , the phase of @xmath90 lags that of @xmath91 by a magnitude of @xmath92 and the positive parts of @xmath91 fill the regions of negative @xmath90 . due to this phase shift",
    ", the angular momentum is transferred between @xmath86 and @xmath87 components and a counterclockwise torque is exerted on @xmath90 .",
    "this phenomenon is more obvious in mode b1 that has a definite spatial orientation .",
    "the most important question relevant to the origin of instabilities arises now : are the density components @xmath93 generated by stellar orbits at resonances ? analytical calculations of sections [ sec : capture - into - resonances ] and [ sec : perturbed - stellar - dynamics ] provide the answer .",
    "the perturbed density @xmath56 of a mode with the pattern speed @xmath7 must be supported by the slow motion of stars in a rotating coordinate frame of angular velocity @xmath7 . in other words , by sitting on a moving coordinate system one must be able to identify a group of stars that are losing their angular velocity , and another group of the same kind but with different initial conditions , gaining it .",
    "a density peak is expected in the region that the angular velocity of the slow ensemble is minimum .",
    "since the angular velocity of a star is minimum at its orbital apocenter , the precession rate of the orbital axes of participating stars in the pattern formation should be in resonance with the pattern speed .",
    "the above scenario is legitimate as long as pattern stars stay far from lindblad resonances that can generate higher density regions due to the radial slowing of stars .",
    "my computations show that all unstable modes fulfill this requirement and azimuthal slowing is the main origin of density perturbations ( see  [ sec : perturbed - stellar - dynamics ] ) .",
    "the evolution of @xmath94 is crucial for understanding the slow dynamics in the configuration space , but we usually have the perturbed distribution and potential functions in the angle - action space . it is thus useful to find how @xmath33 depends on @xmath95 . the simplest relation can be obtained by expanding @xmath96 $ ] in fourier series of @xmath81 as @xmath97 where @xmath98 d\\theta_r .",

    "consequently , stationary modes constitute a continuous family and mathur s ( 1990 ) isolated , pure oscillatory modes are not feasible in stellar disks .",
    "let me now suppose that for some pattern speed @xmath7 in the interval ( [ eq : constraint - pattern - speed - unstable ] ) , the quantity @xmath237 accidentally remains small ( for a group of stars ) over a finite duration of time , but the condition ( [ eq : condition - for - stationary - points ] ) is violated .",
    "this ( likely ) symmetry - breaking phenomenon creates a slim resonant zone of the width @xmath280 ( see  [ sec : resonant - zones - expand ] ) .",
    "there is not any physical constraint on the evolution of @xmath280 when the perturbations are in their early stages . for a steady rate given by ( [ eq : growth - of - delta - versus - s ] ) more stars are trapped by the resonant zone if @xmath281 and the density wave corresponding to the fourier number @xmath172 is magnified .",
    "as i discussed in  [ sec : angular - momentum - at - resonance ] , the angular momentum of the captured stars increases and some other _ reacting stars _ should therefore respond in order to recover the angular momentum balance of the disk .",
    "the reacting stars live in the same cr zone defined by @xmath282 .",
    "as more stars are trapped into resonance by the @xmath172 component , non - resonant components with @xmath283 should also involve more stars to compensate the angular momentum deficit .",
    "so the amplitudes of other wave components increase as well .",
    "this is what i am considering as the origin of instabilities : triggering unsteady density perturbations by the capture of stars into the cr .",
    "angular momentum transfer between non - resonant stars can not be facilitated if a resonant gap does not open in the phase space .",
    "in fact , the initial destabilizing imbalance of @xmath73 is generated by an irreversible engagement of resonant stars even if the amount of angular momentum that they absorb is small ( e.g. , figure 8 in jh ) .",
    "a perturbation with the property of ( [ eq : condition - for - stationary - points ] ) fixes @xmath279 , does not awake stars of @xmath283 components , and it creates a stationary mode .",
    "i conclude that most ( if not all ) unstable modes disappear for @xmath145 just because the cr is destroyed in such a circumstance .",
    "the @xmath172 component is not always an angular momentum absorber .",
    "for example , in models with an inner cutout of the df , one has @xmath263 which enforces @xmath284 ( discussions in  [ sec : angular - momentum - at - resonance ] and jh ) .",
    "figures 2 and 11 in jh demonstrate two modes that show angular momentum emission by the @xmath172 component .",
    "the pattern speeds of some c - modes explored in paper i exceed @xmath285 marginally .",
    "those modes also have @xmath284 .",
    "unstable modes with @xmath145 are barely observed in modal calculations because their large pattern speeds shrink them to the galactic center .",
    "coexistence of mode b1 and a compact c - mode can explain the origin of double - barred galaxies .",
    "for a softened - gravity model of the exponential disk with an inner cutout , alar toomre ( private communication ) also finds an inner edge mode that has a corotation circle inside its pattern .",
    "toomre s inner edge mode is another example of a mode with @xmath263 and @xmath284 .",
    "axisymmetric features / grooves introduced by @xcite to the surface density and df also develop a spiral mode whose pattern is discontinuous at the location of the groove .",
    "that discontinuity is due to the rapid change in the sign of @xmath235 : while the @xmath172 component boosts the angular momentum of stars outside the groove , it has an opposite effect on inner stars .",
    "each unstable mode occupies a finite region in the frequency space due to the finiteness of its cr zone .",
    "this is how divisions ( gaps ) are created between the pattern speeds of unstable modes , the @xmath286-space is quantized by resonances , and finally , unstable modes constitute a discrete family .",
    "growth rates are sorted according to the likelihood of resonant capture , which is proportional to the initial population of stars determined by the equilibrium df . in a stellar disk with a falling density profile",
    ", the growth rates of linear modes are sorted in a decreasing order from compact modes to more extensive ones .",
    "most barred and spiral modes obey this rule ( see paper i ) .",
    "the perturbation theory of  [ sec : perturbed - stellar - dynamics ] says that stars live on the integral manifolds of constant @xmath163 before and after capture into resonance . in order to guarantee a sustained growth of the cr zone",
    ", the initial df @xmath273 must be smooth and non - zero along the curves of constant @xmath163 , and @xmath287 has to flip its sign there .",
    "a resonant zone can not grow in a region of the phase space which is devoid of stars from the beginning , or its stars have been forced to migrate by unsteady processes .",
    "the first - order perturbation theory is valid as long as the cr zone of each mode is inaccessible by the stars of other modes and @xmath163 is an adiabatic invariant .",
    "perhaps the most important issue related to the growth of instabilities is that the amplitudes of unstable modes are saturated after several pattern rotations .",
    "saturation is indeed a nonlinear phenomenon and can have complex routes .",
    "@xcite suggest that the growth of a mode is stopped by the emergence of horseshoe orbits .",
    "what they call  horseshoe orbits \" are simply the librational orbits captured by the cr .",
    "i found those orbits the main cause of instabilities .",
    "i agree with @xcite that the linear perturbation theory must fail at some stage , but it does not necessarily imply that resonant zones can self - control their expansion beyond the linear regime . using",
    "the phase space geometry and the nonexistence of the first integral @xmath163 at the boundaries of neighboring resonances , i argue that resonance overlapping is an alternative and efficient mechanism to stop the growth of unstable modes .",
    "the stabilization of stellar disks in the presence of the ilrs is also explained by the same mechanism .",
    "i then present a simple criterion for the stability of non - axisymmetric perturbations , and discuss about the stability of self - consistent scale - free disks .      as a mode grows ,",
    "the width of its cr zone increases proportional to @xmath288 until two adjacent zones , corresponding to modes of different pattern speeds , overlap and compete for trapping the stars in the overlapping zone .",
    "this is the moment that a chaotic layer occurs in the phase space according to chirikov s ( 1979 ) theory , and stars living in that layer repeatedly migrate between different resonant zones .",
    "thus , the share contributed to each competing resonant zone from stars in the overlapping region drops substantially and the growth is suppressed .",
    "a natural consequence of the emergence of a chaotic layer is the radial migration of stars that heats up the disk .",
    "some modes may be gradually dissolved as their kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( kam ) tori around stable periodic orbits are destroyed by modes with larger resonant zones and growth rates .",
    "i remark that the weighted residual form of the cbe that i obtained in paper i is valid as long as we are allowed to average out angle variables from dynamical equations . after the occurrence of chaotic orbits it is impossible to average out resonant angles and extra coupling terms between the amplitudes of unstable modes",
    "are contributed to the reduced cbe .",
    "details of my numerical simulations in the nonlinear regime and in the presence of chaotic orbits will be presented in paper iii .",
    "figure [ pic : zones - b1-s1-s3-s6 ] shows the @xmath172 resonant zones of modes b1 , s1 , s3 , and s6 for the initially circular orbits ( @xmath177 ) of the model introduced in  [ sec : used - model ] .",
    "this is the first demostartion of its kind that shows how the resonant zones of different unstable modes partition the phase space of a stellar disk .",
    "since the perturbations grow according to an exponential law , resonant zones had been slim rings infinitely long ago . the structure shown in figure [ pic : zones - b1-s1-s3-s6 ]",
    "has been obtained by setting @xmath289 for all modes . correspondingly , resonant gaps are of comparable size at the displayed moment but they will not remain so because the growth rates are different .",
    "left panel in figure [ pic : zones - overlap ] shows the amplitude function @xmath290 of the same modes of figure [ pic : zones - b1-s1-s3-s6 ] but this time in the frequency space that covers all possible values of @xmath163 .",
    "arrows indicate the expansion direction of the @xmath172 fourier component as the modes grow .",
    "the growth rates of modes are different and mode s6 , which is at the bifurcation point of the s - family ( see figure 2_a _ in paper i ) , has the smallest @xmath55 .",
    "the configuration of the cr zones in the phase / frequency space and their thickening according to equation ( [ eq : growth - of - delta - versus - s ] ) suggest that resonance overlapping is likely in stellar disks with rich branches of unstable modes in their eigenspectra .    to find out how and when an overlap takes place , i assume two growing waves with the eigenvalues @xmath291 and @xmath292 that successively appear in the spectrum with @xmath293 . these waves develop cr zones of widths @xmath294 and @xmath295 on each manifold of constant @xmath163 , and i define @xmath296 as the distance between the instantaneous elliptic points of those zones .",
    "let me suppose that the global minimum of @xmath296 corresponds to the critical action @xmath297 .",
    "an overlap thus occurs if @xmath298 .",

    "if the post - linear changes in the df allow for a sustained expansion of resonant zones ( when the amplitude growth is no longer exponential ) , one can still anticipate an overlap for larger values of @xmath305 .",
    "cooling a stellar disk increases the number of unstable modes ( figure 6 in paper i ) and decreases the gaps between the cr zones .",
    "consequently , transition to chaos is faster in cold disks than hot ones .",
    "this result is in harmony with sellwood s ( 2007 , private communication ) @xmath1-body experiments .",
    "the very first overlapping does not necessarily occur between the modes of the same azimuthal wavenumber @xmath8 .",
    "the pattern speeds of two rapidly growing modes of different @xmath8 may result in a very small @xmath305 and thus cause an early - stage overlap .",
    "the fundamental bar mode may still be saturated in the absence of spiral modes and in a shorter time scale than chaotic diffusion of stars .",
    "when the resonant zone of mode b1 grows , the inner homoclinic loop rapidly shrinks to central regions , the supply of stars to the cr zone is cut from the galactic center , and the bar mode saturates there . on the other hand",
    ", the bar continues to elongate because of the expansion of the outer homoclinic loop .",
    "the elongation rate , however , will slow down if @xmath262 .",
    "a declining rate of amplitude growth gives time to the trapped stars to fill their invariant tori and maintain the bar in outer regions .",
    "disappearance of unstable modes when the pattern speed violates ( [ eq : condition - for - no - ilr ] ) can also be explained by the same mechanism that saturates instabilities .",
    "the ilr emerges when the line @xmath147 crosses the circular orbit boundary @xmath138 .",
    "this happens while the line @xmath306 has a crossing too and the cr zone has already been created .",
    "the competition between the ilr and cr near their neighboring boundaries can therefore prohibit both resonances from broadening their zones and the disk develops a stationary wave .",
    "right panel in figure [ pic : zones - overlap ] shows the frequency space of the cored exponential disk together with the lines @xmath144 and @xmath147 that have been drawn for @xmath307 and @xmath3081,2,3 .",
    "the line @xmath309 never intersects the frequency space independent of the magnitude of @xmath310 .",
    "a crossing is possible for @xmath311 and the slope of @xmath147 increases proportional to @xmath8 .",
    "subsequently , the distance between the cr and ilr zones decreases by increasing @xmath8 and the disk shows more reluctance against developing an unstable mode ( see figure 1 in paper i ) .",
    "@xcite had also reached a similar result for their three- and four - armed modes , and interpreted it based on the closeness of ilr and cr but with no mention of the increased likelihood of resonance overlapping .",
    "having resonant zones of finite width for both the cr and ilr is an essential prerequisite for their subsequent competition .",
    "the @xmath80th fourier component in the radial angle can trap stars into a growing resonant zone if @xmath273 is smooth and non - zero on a range of manifolds of constant @xmath312 , and @xmath313 can switch its sign in that neighborhood .",
    "having some population of stars on circular orbits always guarantees the creation and growth of the cr zone because @xmath163 is identical to @xmath314 and @xmath315 can vary independently .",
    "however , if the ilr exists , its adiabatic invariant is defined by @xmath316 and the variation of @xmath209 in the vicinity of a resonant value implies the variation of @xmath314 .",
    "therefore , the ilr can develop a growing resonant zone if @xmath273 has a functional dependence on both actions .",
    "stellar disks with such a property will have non - zero radial velocity dispersions ( warm disks ) .",
    "let me now consider a group of stars moving on near - circular orbits that satisfy @xmath317 and have been suddenly trapped into resonance by the ilr . on the resonant tori ,",
    "the orbits of those stars are deformed so that @xmath316 remains constant .",
    "this means that orbits are elongated as @xmath314 continuously increases from its tiny initial value and @xmath318 drops until @xmath269 becomes negative and phase space flows reach their turning points . at this moment , some stars are likely to find themselves on the integral manifolds of constant @xmath319 and join the cr zone while they carry energy and angular momentum away from the ilr .",
    "a reverse migration is also possible .",
    "the switchings can only take place in the overlapping region of the ilr and cr where highly eccentric orbits live and @xmath320 .",
    "an effective early - stage overlap requires a non - zero @xmath273 in the cross section @xmath321 of the sets @xmath322 as a result , infinitesimal wave amplitudes ( in the linear regime ) can suppress their own growth due to the competition between the cr and ilr . in the overlapping region",
    "@xmath321 neither @xmath242 ( for @xmath172 ) nor @xmath316 ( for @xmath126 ) are conserved and that region is filled by chaotic orbits .",
    "the chaotic layer should be very narrow in the linear regime , but it will become thick in steady large - amplitude bars @xcite .    the stability of warm stellar disks for @xmath323 can be deduced from an independent mathematical reasoning as follows .",
    "equation ( [ eq : growth - of - delta - versus - s ] ) applies to any growing resonant gap in the phase space .",
    "let me assume that the ilr and cr of a wave with the pattern speed @xmath7 are widening their resonant zones with the rates @xmath324 in an equilibrium disk with @xmath325 , the probability of capture into the ilr is more than the cr , and according to ( [ eq : delta - for - cr - and - ilr ] ) , we need @xmath326 to assure a faster expansion rate of the ilr zone .",
    "this inequality contradicts the basic assumption of linear analysis that separates the time - dependent part of perturbations as @xmath327 and assigns the same growing envelope and pattern speed to all parts of a normal mode .",
    "therefore , the only possibility for a disk with a monotonic density gradient will be @xmath328 . in cold disks with @xmath329 , where @xmath330 is dirac s delta function , the ilr can not open a resonant gap because it suffers from the lack of fuel ( stars ) needed for a possible expansion along the curves of constant @xmath316 .",
    "this automatically implies @xmath331 and a unique value is assigned to @xmath332 .",
    "the cr zone can thus grow freely and destabilize the disk .",
    "it is worth noting that with an inner cutout , the surface density rises in central regions , reaches to a maximum and then decays outwards .",
    "denote @xmath333 and @xmath334 as the corotation and inner lindblad radii , respectively .",
    "if the cutout is not sharp and the density peak lies fairly between @xmath334 and @xmath333 ( see the leftmost panel in figure 8 of evans & read 1998b ) , it will be possible to find two points of the same density on the curve of @xmath335 : one near the ilr on the rising part of @xmath335 and the other near the cr on the falling side , i.e. , @xmath336 .",
    "thus , the ilr and cr can manage to grow with the same rate @xmath337 and an unstable mode emerges .",
    "such modes have been demonstarted in figure 7 of @xcite whose cutout functions immobilize the circular orbits of the galactic center and all near - radial orbits . accordingly , the population of active stars in the overlapping region of the ilr and cr declines substantially and the simultaneous growth of both resonances becomes likely . by decreasing the pattern speed , the ilr moves outside the cutout radius and its resonant zone becomes visible to the cr .",
    "the stellar disk is therefore stabilized .",
    "the condition @xmath338 can not be reached if @xmath339 differs remarkably from @xmath340 .",
    "this happens when both the ilr and cr lie outside the cutout radius or when the cutout is so sharp .",
    "the above analysis shows how diverse the response of disk galaxies may be to non - axisymmetric excitations .",
    "@xcite suggested that the two parameters @xmath36 and @xmath341 decide the fate of non - axisymmetric density waves .",
    "wave mechanics based on the behavior of resonances , shows more complex decisive factors that govern the evolution of density waves , specially near the critical values of @xmath342 and for non - monotonic gradients of equilibrium density .",
    "i am now in a position to provide a simple criterion for the stability of stellar disks in the absence of the ilr .",
    "it is the cr that captures stars , contributes an angular momentum imbalance to the stellar disk , and triggers unstable modes .",
    "circumferential waves will be _ globally stable _ if resonant gaps do not open near the cr for all possible pattern speeds .",
    "consequently , @xmath343 should remain zero , which according to equation ( [ eq : torque - component-1 ] ) implies @xmath344 this condition is satisfied only if [ see equations ( [ eq : define - lambda ] ) and ( [ eq : define - phi - vs - psi ] ) ] @xmath345 the stability criterion given in ( [ eq : condition - stability-1 ] ) can also be deduced from the earlier works of lbk and jh as i explain below .",

    "the amount of angular momentum emitted / absrobed by the @xmath172 component is therefore determined by @xmath350_{l=0}=-2(m\\pi)^2 se^{2st } \\int d\\textbf{\\textit{j } }   { \\partial f_0\\over \\partial j_{\\phi } } { |\\tilde v_{0}|^2 \\over |m\\omega _ { \\phi }",
    "-\\omega|^2 } , \\label{eq : dl - dt - from - jh - cr}\\ ] ] which reduces to equation ( 96 ) of @xcite as @xmath272 .",
    "it is seen that the sign of @xmath235 determines whether the angular momentum is added to , or drained from the @xmath172 wave component .",
    "furthermore , the cr will not imbalance @xmath73 if the condition ( [ eq : condition - stability-1 ] ) holds .",
    "this means that the condition ( [ eq : condition - for - stationary - points ] ) can not be violated according to my discussion of  [ sec : origin - of - instabilities ] , and @xmath55 should vanish for arbitrary perturbations .",
    "a stellar disk that satisfies ( [ eq : condition - stability-1 ] ) will be hot because it is impossible to reproduce the surface density gradient in the limit of @xmath351 with a df that does not depend on @xmath318 .",
    "it has now become more transparent why there is a correlation between toomre s ( 1964 ) @xmath36 and the disk stability for non - axisymmetric excitations .",
    "an illustrative example has been given in figure 6 of paper i. most of s - modes disappear when the parameter @xmath1 of the df is decreased and more stars are distributed on near - radial orbits .",
    "stability analysis of cuspy mass models has been a big puzzle in stellar dynamics since @xcite computed the global modes of mestel s ( 1963 ) disk and showed the importance of @xmath352 excitations .",
    "to tackle the singular center of mestel s disk , he introduced an inner cutout that freezes central stars with diverging orbital frequencies .",
    "@xcite followed the same procedure but for different cusp slopes . in spite of all these remarkable efforts ,",
    "what h02 illustrated for the frequency space of scale - free potentials was indeed the key to resolve the long - standing stability problem of scale - free disks without any simplifying cutouts .",
    "the map of the angular sector that h02 plotted in his figure 1 for the scale - free potentials @xcite @xmath353 will be an angular sector in the @xmath354-space with the @xmath136-axis and the straight line @xmath355 being its lower and upper boundaries , respectively .",
    "the slope of the upper boundary is always less than or equal to @xmath356 .",
    "it is therefore obvious that except for @xmath352 , all @xmath147 and @xmath144 lines will intersect the frequency space ( whatever @xmath7 may be ) and resonance overlapping between the cr and ilr can occur if there are enough number of non - circular orbits .",
    "in other words , the radial velocity dispersion @xmath357 ( defined in evans & read 1998a ) should exceed a critical value @xmath358 to give rise to nonempty cross sections @xmath359 .",
    "this is possible only for @xmath0 excitations and it suggests that scale - free disks are subject to @xmath352 instabilities . finding @xmath358 is an open , yet conceivable , problem that can generalize toomre s ( 1964 ) criterion to non - axisymmetric perturbations of scale - free disks .",
    "i explained in ",
    "[ sec : role - of - ilr ] that the ilr can not help to stabilize cold disks .",
    "that argument applies to self - consistent scale - free disks as well , and strongly justifies the existence of @xmath358 for @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , a stability condition like @xmath360 may correlate with lynden - bell s ( 1993 , equation 6 - 23 ) criterion , which has been formulated based on the angular dispersion of lobe tumble rates .",
    "i had already given an evidence in ",
    "[ sec : modes - in - frequency - space ] that lbk s theory can not be extended to large growth rates .",
    "here i provide a more detailed analysis of lbk s mode mechanism . taking the @xmath272 limit of ( [ eq : dl - dt - from - jh ] ) leads to equation ( 30 ) of lbk .",
    "the resulting integrand of the @xmath80th component involves the term @xmath361 but its argument never becomes zero for @xmath362 as long as @xmath7 exceeds @xmath363 .",
    "once the delta function vanishes for @xmath364 , the angular momentum content of @xmath362 components remains zero .",
    "therefore , angular momentum transfer between inner and outer resonances as suggested by lbk , is feasible only for @xmath365 .",
    "this is a constraint on the applicability of lbk s theory .    according to the arguments of  [ sec : role - of - ilr ] and the wkb theory ,",
    "the ilr is not transparent to short wavelength disturbances with @xmath366 @xcite and any developing spiral structure must be damped unless the ilr remains invisible to the cr .",
    "therefore , an inconsistent point in lbk s paper is the imagination of an angular - momentum - transferring spiral structure while the condition @xmath367 has already abandoned the existence of such structures .",
    "an issue yet needs to be explained : if there is no spiral structure in stable disks , which mechanism does transfer the angular momentum between inner and outer resonances ?",
    "in fact , in the limit of @xmath272 the density components @xmath91 and @xmath90 become stationary waves that are azimuthally separated by a phase shift of @xmath368 ( like the components of mode b1 in figure [ pic : components - modes - b1-s2 ] ) .",
    "thus , they exert opposite gravitational torques on each other without any need for a communicating spiral structure .    in this paper i decomposed unstable modes of a model disk galaxy to its constituent fourier components and showed how different components experience a gravitational torque .",
    "my results clearly showed that only the fourier component associated with the cr generates a resonant zone in the phase space , and other components exchange angular momentum far from resonances .",
    "this result led me to introduce a new dynamical mechanism that triggers unstable modes .",
    "according to my calculations , an irreversible resonant capture of stars into the cr causes a synchronous precession of their orbital axes , which in turn , support a rotating density pattern .",
    "the emerged pattern grows because the resonant zone expands in the frequency space .",
    "the irreversibility of resonant trapping is the most destructive event that happens in a stellar disk when a group of resonant stars with @xmath369 gain angular momentum forever .",
    "an immediate consequence of this phenomenon is the angular momentum imbalance in the disk , which requires proper reaction of other stars in order to conserve @xmath73 .",
    "this is how the fourier components of @xmath202 are generated and the angular momentum transfer between them is initiated .",
    "reacting stars do not have a librating @xmath174 and they cooperate in a way that the quantity @xmath370 remains small for all components .    using the maps of resonance zones in the phase and frequency spaces",
    ", i argued that resonance overlapping should stop the growth of unstable modes and stabilize stellar disks in the presence of an ilr .",
    "i showed that for @xmath0 the emergence of an ilr is inevitable in scale - free models .",
    "the competition between the cr and ilr can therefore stabilize sufficiently warm scale - free disks against @xmath0 excitations .",
    "@xcite suggested in  6.1 of their paper that self - consistent scale - free disks ( without inner cutouts ) do not admit growing non - axisymmetric modes at all , and they ruled out the possibility of a critical temperature .",
    "their prediction is in agreement with my results except in two aspects : ( i ) since the line @xmath371 does not intersect the frequency space of scale - free models , there is no ilr to compete with a growing cr and density waves will be amplified for @xmath352 .",
    "( ii ) the ilr in cold disks is very special and it can not develop a resonant zone of finite size .",
    "it is therefore hard to believe a serious influence by the ilr on the phase space flows up to a critical temperature .",
    "note that each unstable mode dominates an isolated region of the frequency ( action ) space until a chaotic layer emerges due to resonance overlapping .",
    "the rate by which the chaotic layer diffuses itself in the phase space , is determined by the resistance of kam tori against competing resonant zones .",
    "the limited space that the fastest growing bar mode occupies after its saturation ( khoperskov et al .",
    "2007 ) , is an @xmath1-body evidence for such a resistance of spiral modes that fill outer regions of the cored exponential disk .",
    "the other implication of resonance overlapping , which has observational support too , is that the central bar in grand - design barred spiral galaxies must join the spiral arms at the tips of the bar , which are the overlapping regions of two neighboring b and s modes in the frequency space ( see figure [ pic : zones - overlap ] ) .",
    "i note that the pattern speeds of the spiral and bar components are not the same because these structures are associated with different modes .",
    "the overlapping region is filled by chaotic orbits that yield the turbulent mixing of density waves .",
    "this process can enhance star formation near the tips of the bar .",
    "if we accept this scenario , barred spiral galaxies should have been formed from hot stellar disks whose eigenfrequency spectra include few spiral modes . on the other hand , flocculent spirals with many wave packets will be the natural destiny of initially cold disks that give birth to a rich family of spiral modes .",
    "the mathematical background for the nonlinear evolution of modes was developed in paper i but that formulation is valid as long as averaging is allowed over angle variables . in the presence of chaotic orbits",
    "it is impossible to average out resonant angles and some modifications are required to deal with the cbe in its full nonlinear form .",
    "i will present such modifications in paper iii with the aim of discovering the dynamical processes that generate different classes of barred and spiral structures .",
    "i thank scott tremaine and chris hunter for their encouragement and stimulating discussions in the course of my calculations and writing the manuscript .",
    "i also express my sincere thanks to the referee whose illuminating comments helped me to further my calculations and thoroughly revise the presentation and arguments of sections 5 through 8 .",
