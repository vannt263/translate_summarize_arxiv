    "the wedge geometry is an attractive system to study in connection with the casimir effect , since the geometry is nontrivial enough to exhibit the essentials of phenomenological quantum field theory in continuous media , and yet so simple that it avoids the formal divergences that so often plague specific calculations once curved boundaries are present .",
    "an additional bonus from considering a system of this kind is that one experiences an interesting formal analogy with the theory of a straight cosmic string .    in this paper",
    "we will consider the casimir theory of a wedge - shaped region of opening angle @xmath0 , when the walls located at angles @xmath3 and @xmath4 are perfectly conducting , and the interior region @xmath5 is filled with a homogeneous and isotropic dielectric medium of constant permittivity @xmath1 and permeability @xmath2 .",
    "figure 1 shows the geometry .",
    "the cusp is at the origin .",
    "the present paper is a generalization of earlier work [ 1 ] , in which the interior volume was taken to be a vacuum , and is also closely related to ref .",
    "[ 2 ] . as for references to the earlier literature , we mention those listed in [ 1 ] and [ 2 ] .",
    "we may only recall here that our formalism is based upon schwinger s source theory , as developed for the strongly related case of cylindrical geometry in [ 3 ] and [ 4 ] , and is related to the general formalism given in stratton s book [ 5 ] .",
    "a somewhat different approach is followed by mostepanenko and trunov in their book [ 6 ] ; their section 2.3 treats the specific wedge geometry in the vacuum case .",
    "we ought to point out that the formulation of casimir theory to include material properties in the bulk does not imply merely an almost trivial input of factors @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the phenomenological electrodynamics is generally quite different from electrodynamics in a vacuum . in particular , the four - momentum of a photon in a medium as constructed on basis of minkowski s energy - momentum tensor - or equivalently from the hamiltonian approach - is spacelike , so it is possible to make the electrodynamic field energy _ negative _ by means of a lorentz transformation .",
    "( physically , it is precisely properties of this sort that are underlying the recent discussions on the so - called analog models of general relativity ; cf . , for instance , the papers of leonhardt and piwnicki [ 7 ] and the conference report in [ 8 ] . )    in the following section we derive the expression for the fundamental dyad @xmath6 , from which the effective products of the fields can be constructed .",
    "the two scalar green functions , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , are determined . in section 4",
    ", the electromagnetic energy - momentum tensor @xmath9 is calculated .",
    "it is rather remarkable , as shown by eq .",
    "( [ 37 ] ) , how the formalism conspires so as to  give a very simple result : the components of @xmath10 reflect the presence of the medium only through a common prefactor @xmath11 . in section 5",
    "we discuss possibilities for measurements , in particular , how the deflection of an atomic beam in a medium - filled wedge is influenced by the medium .",
    "also , the formal analogy with the theory of cosmic strings is briefly commented upon .",
    "we put @xmath12 , and adopt electromagnetic heaviside - lorentz units .",
    "referring to the formalism developed in [ 1 ] and [ 2 ] for the vacuum fields in the bulk , we can here be brief .",
    "we give only the basic definitions , and write down formulas when they deviate from the vacuum case . the starting point , as always when working with schwinger s",
    "source theory , is the relationship    @xmath13    between the electric field @xmath14  and the polarization source @xmath15 . here",
    "@xmath16  is the basic dyad in the formalism ; its fourier transform @xmath17 follows from @xmath18 with @xmath19 .",
    "maxwell s equations lead to the governing equation @xmath20 where @xmath21  is the unit dyad .",
    "it is  advantageous to introduce a new dyad @xmath22 which is divergence - free , @xmath23 the effective electric and magnetic field products are ( in addition to [ 1 - 4 ] cf .",

    "using eqs . ( [ 5 ] ) , ( [ 6 ] ) and ( [ 9 ] ) , ( [ 10 ] ) we can now calculate the effective field product within the wedge , assuming that the two spacetime points @xmath57 and @xmath58 are separated . in full generality , all coordinates @xmath59 would be different from @xmath60 .",

    "these products do not vanish by themselves , but it is notable that the sum @xmath76 , present in the electromagnetic stress tensor , does vanish .",
    "it is also to be noted that the auxiliary green functions @xmath64  with @xmath65  do not contribute to the field products .",
    "this is because of the relations @xmath77 , as well as @xmath78 @xmath79 finally , one may verify by explicit calculation that the poynting vector vanishes .",
    "this is as one would expect , under stationary conditions .",
    "it is to be emphasized that the differences @xmath80and @xmath81  are at the present stage of the calculation arbitrary ; they are not necessarily small .",
    "we now let the two points @xmath82  and @xmath83  approach each other , but keep both @xmath80 and @xmath84  different from zero . for convenience we write henceforth @xmath85  instead of @xmath86 , etc .",

    ", @xmath91  corresponds to a homogeneous dielectric extending over all space .",
    "explicit calculation shows that the contact term becomes equal to the wedge effective product evaluated at @xmath92 : @xmath93 altough this is a natural result , it could hardly have been written down beforehand , without explicit calculation .",

    "the simplicity of the expression ( [ 37 ] ) is rather remarkable .",
    "the expression differs from the corresponding expression in vacuum [ 1 ] only through the factor @xmath120 in the denominator .",
    "a value @xmath121 of the refractive index @xmath122 thus causes the energy density in the bulk , as well as the normal stress on the plates , to be less than the vacuum value . in the special case of  @xmath123 , a case considered repeatedly in recent years in various contexts ( a",

    "we consider first the normal surface density on the lower wall , @xmath3 , as a function of the distance @xmath82 from the cusp . for convenience we will denote this force density by @xmath124 .",
    "since our triplet of basis vectors in the spatial directions @xmath125  is orthonormal , @xmath124  must simply be equal to @xmath126 , taken at the wall .",
    "thus , in dimensional units , @xmath127 the force between the walls is attractive , as expected , and it decreases quickly when one moves away from the cusp .",
    "the divergence at the cusp is clearly fictitious : the presence of a skin depth @xmath128  in the material forbids us to apply the continuum dielectric model at very small distances .",
    "assume copper , for instance , for which the conductivity is @xmath129 . as the most significant frequencies contributing to the casimir force are of the order @xmath130 , where @xmath131 is the local separation between the walls , we obtain @xmath132 if @xmath133 ( the typical separation distance ) [ 1 ] .",
