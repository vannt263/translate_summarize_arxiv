    "the @xmath5 decays dalitz plot distributions can be expanded in powers of dalitz plot variables @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xcite :    @xmath8    @xmath9 @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the four - momenta of the decaying kaon and @xmath13th pion ( @xmath14 for the `` odd charge '' pion ) , respectively .    in the case of the @xmath2 decay",
    "the expression ( [ dalitz_plot ] ) reduces to @xcite :    @xmath15    @xmath16 because of the identical final state particles .",
    "a positive / negative value of the quadratic slope parameter @xmath1 would mean that asymmetric / symmetric final states are favoured .",
    "based only on isospin symmetry and some general assumptions it is possible to define a relation @xmath17 between the quadratic @xmath18 and linear @xmath19 dalitz plot slope parameters and the final state interaction phases @xmath20 which should be approximately the same for all @xmath5 decays @xcite . for @xmath2",
    "decays the parameter @xmath21 is equal to @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) and is not influenced by radiative corrections since all the final state particles are neutral .",
    "thus a high statistics measurement of the quadratic slope parameter in the @xmath2 decay dalitz plot could establish strong constraints to the dalitz plot slope parameters and f.s.i .",
    "phases in other @xmath5 decays .",
    "also , it could be useful in the evaluation of radiative corrections applied to @xmath24 and @xmath25 decays . on the other hand , by combining the @xmath2 decay dalitz plot slope parameter @xmath1 with the linear and quadratic slope parameters in the @xmath24 decay it is possible to probe the validity of the @xmath26 rule .",
    "the @xmath2 dalitz plot slope parameter @xmath1 has been estimated in the framework of chpt @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "the analysis includes a nonzero @xmath27 amplitude in the quadratic term of the dalitz plot expansion ( [ dalitz_plot ] ) by taking into account the next - to - leading @xmath28 corrections .",
    "the phenomenological coupling constants in the chiral lagrangian are evaluated using a fit to the recent experimental data in both @xmath29 and @xmath5 decays .    in this paper",
    "we present a measurement based upon a data set collected with the na48 detector in 1998 .",
    "the detector acceptance has been estimated using a detailed monte carlo ( mc ) simulation .",
    "the na48 experiment is dedicated to the measurement of direct cp violation in @xmath30 decays .",
    "the @xmath31 beam is produced by @xmath32 gev / c protons from the cern sps hitting a @xmath33 mm diameter and @xmath34 mm long beryllium target at a production angle of @xmath35 mrad . passing through a set of collimators , a @xmath36 mrad divergent @xmath31 beam enters the decay volume @xmath37 m downstream of the target .",
    "the evacuated @xmath38 m long decay volume is followed by a helium tank which contains four drift chambers of the charged particle spectrometer . after the tank a scintillator hodoscope , a liquid krypton electromagnetic calorimeter ,",
    "a hadron calorimeter and muon veto counters are placed .",
    "the liquid krypton calorimeter ( lkr ) is designed to measure the energy , position and timing of electromagnetic showers @xcite .",
    "the @xmath39 cm long detector consists of 13212 readout cells in a projective tower geometry which points to the middle of the decay volume .",
    "each cell of @xmath40 @xmath41 cross section is made of copper - beryllium ribbons which are extended longitudinally in a @xmath42 mrad accordion structure .",
    "the readout cells are contained in a cryostat filled with about @xmath43 t liquid krypton at @xmath44 k. the initial current induced on the copper - beryllium electrodes is measured by @xmath45 ns fwhm and digitized by @xmath46 mhz fadcs .",
    "for the 1998 data taking period , the energy and position resolutions of the calorimeter were determined to be :    @xmath47    @xmath48    with @xmath49 measured in gev .",
    "the time resolution was better than @xmath50 ps for photons with energies above @xmath43 gev .",
    "the energy non - linearity in the calorimeter response was found to be less than @xmath51 between @xmath52 gev and @xmath53 gev @xcite .",
    "the lkr detector contains the so - called neutral hodoscope which is made of a 4 mm thick plane of scintillating fibres placed near the maximum of the e.m . shower development .",
    "the neutral hodoscope is used in the estimation of the main trigger inefficiency and for an additional measurement of the event time .",
    "a description of the whole experimental setup can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the @xmath4 data sample was acquired by three different triggers .",
    "the first one is the neutral @xmath54 trigger ( nut @xmath54 ) in which each @xmath55 ns the calibrated analogue sums of @xmath56 lkr cells are used to construct @xmath57-channel @xmath58 and @xmath59 projections of the energy deposited in the calorimeter @xcite .",
    "based on these projections the total deposited energy @xmath60 , the first and second moments of the @xmath58 and @xmath59 energy distributions , and the time of the energy peaks are computed .",
    "the centre - of - gravity cog of the event and the longitudinal vertex position are reconstructed as : @xmath61 @xmath62 where @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , @xmath66 are the first and second moments of the energy deposition , @xmath67 is the longitudinal position of the calorimeter and @xmath68 is the nominal kaon mass .",
    "the proper decay time @xmath69 from the beginning of the decay region ( just after the final collimator ) in units of the @xmath70 lifetime @xmath71 is derived taking into account calibration constants .",
    "the events are accepted by the nut @xmath54 trigger if @xmath72 gev , @xmath73 cm and @xmath74 .",
    "in addition , less than @xmath52 energy peaks within @xmath75 ns in both the @xmath58 and @xmath59 projections are required .",
    "the second trigger ( nut @xmath76 ) uses the same hardware chain as nut @xmath54 trigger but is specially set - up to select @xmath76 events by applying no condition on the number of the energy peaks .",
    "the third trigger ( nhodo ) is based on the information from the neutral hodoscope .",
    "it requires a coincidence of signals from the upper and lower or the left and right parts of the calorimeter . in order to reduce the trigger output rates the nhodo trigger and the nut @xmath76 one",
    "were properly down - scaled .",
    "the @xmath4 events were selected from all events which met at least one of the trigger requirements .",
    "the selection criteria required 6 or more lkr clusters satisfying the following conditions :    * the energy of the cluster had to be between @xmath77 gev and @xmath53 gev ; * to avoid energy losses in the lkr , the distance from the cluster to the closest dead calorimeter cell was required to be greater than @xmath33 cm and the cluster had to be more than @xmath78 cm from the beam pipe and the outer edge of the calorimeter .",
    "all possible combinations of @xmath52 clusters which passed these requirements were considered .",
    "in addition , the following further selection criteria were applied on each combination :    * the distance between all cluster pairs had to be greater than @xmath79 cm in order to avoid overlapping of the clusters ; * all @xmath52 clusters had to lie within @xmath78 ns from the average cluster time ; * the sum of the clusters energies had to exceed @xmath80 gev which is sufficiently far from the nut @xmath54 and nut @xmath76 trigger threshold of @xmath81 gev ; * the radial position of the center - of - gravity + @xmath82 where @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 are the energies and positions of the six selected clusters , had to be less than @xmath79 cm ; * no additional clusters with an energy @xmath86 gev were allowed within @xmath87 ns from the event time to minimize possible accidental effects .",
    "the longitudinal vertex positions were reconstructed analogous to ( [ z_trig ] ) : @xmath88 } } { m_{k}}\\ ] ] where @xmath83 and @xmath84 , @xmath85 are the energies and positions of the six selected clusters .    for each combination the invariant masses",
    "@xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 of all @xmath92 possible photon pairings were computed using @xmath93 . by applying a @xmath94 criteria , the combination and pairing most compatible with the hypothesis that @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 are equal to the nominal @xmath95 mass were picked .    to ensure the purity of the sample , events which had one or more reconstructed tracks in the spectrometer or more than one hit per plane in the third and fourth drift chambers were rejected .    to improve the resolution on the dalitz plot variables @xmath96 and @xmath97 and to reduce differences in the energy resolutions and non - linearities between data and mc which may bias the measurement of the quadratic slope parameter @xmath1",
    ", all the events were passed through a kinematical fitting procedure with constraints . assuming the neutral kaon coming from the @xmath31 target and a @xmath98 decay the cluster energies and positions are adjusted to minimize @xmath99 where @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 are given by ( [ e_resol]),([x_resol ] ) and @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 are the adjusted energies and positions of the photons as functions of the @xmath92 decay parameters ( the kaon energy , the vertex position , the three euler angles of the decay plane in the kaon rest frame , the dalitz plot variables @xmath96 and @xmath106 and the 2 angles of the @xmath107 directions for each of the decaying @xmath95s ) . while the effect of the kinematical fitting on the @xmath108 and @xmath93 resolutions was small , the @xmath96 and @xmath106 resolutions were improved significantly .",
    "in particular the rms widths of @xmath109 and @xmath110 from @xmath111 and @xmath112 mrad became @xmath113 and @xmath114 mrad , respectively .",
    "finally a cut @xmath115 was applied to exclude the tails in the @xmath116 distribution which differ for data and mc .",
    "the numbers of data and mc events which passed the selection criteria are presented in table [ result ] .",
    ".[result]the summary of the number of accepted events and the measured values of the dalitz plot slope parameter @xmath117 for the nut @xmath118 , nut @xmath119 and nhodo triggers .",
    "the errors are statistical only . + [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     an important check of the reliability of the mc was done by comparing the data and mc dalitz plot variable @xmath106 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_theta ] ) .    a linear fit to the ratio of the data and mc @xmath106 distributions clearly points to a very good agreement between experimental data and the simulation .",
    "the second considered source of systematics was the difference between the data and mc cluster energy resolution . using the measured and kinematically adjusted cluster energies we established a strong control over the resolutions seen in the data and the mc .",
    "the differences in the resolutions were adjusted by an additional smearing to the cluster energies in the mc . the maximum change in @xmath1 after these adjustments was found to be @xmath120 and was taken as a systematic error .",
    "a similar approach was applied in the study of the systematics due to the energy non - linearities leading to a @xmath121 systematic error on the @xmath1 . to take into account small non - gaussian tails in the cluster energy resolution seen in the data ,",
    "a simplified parameterization was used to add the tails to the mc events .",
    "the effect of the tails was found to be negligible . changing the energy scale in the mc by @xmath122 we got a shift in @xmath1 of @xmath121 .",
    "the influence of the trigger conditions was studied by subdividing the data and mc in @xmath123 bins .",
    "although that for the nut @xmath54 and nhodo trigger samples no systematic effect was found , the result for nut @xmath76 trigger sample was affected by a small nut inefficient region near the @xmath124 cut . the data and mc were processed excluding this region and the change in the result of @xmath125 gave us a systematic error due to the trigger .",
    "the stability of the result upon the @xmath116 cut was checked by loosening it to @xmath126 .",
    "no statistically significant effect on @xmath1 was established .",
    "furthermore , the result was found to be stable upon different cuts on the clusters energies and positions in lkr .",
    "no influence of a possible background contamination from @xmath107 conversions and dalitz decays was observed .",
    "all the sources of systematic error were added quadratically and yield a total systematic error of @xmath127 .",
    "in addition , a second independent analysis has been performed yielding a consistent result .",
    "our result for the dalitz plot slope parameter in the @xmath2 decay is @xmath128 , where the errors are statistical and systematic , respectively .",
    "this result is in an agreement with the value of @xmath129 predicted in @xcite .",
    "the previous measurement of @xmath130 performed by the e731 experiment @xcite , is comparable with the result presented in this paper .",
