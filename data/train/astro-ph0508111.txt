    "a correlation between grb variability and peak luminosity was first proposed by fenimore et al .",
    "motivated by this , reichart et al .",
    "( 2001 ) constructed a robust measure of grb variability and computed variabilities for 18 grbs with high time - resolution ( 64 msec ) light curves and variability lower limits for two grbs with low time - resolution ( 1 sec ) light curves .",
    "of the former 18 grbs , 11 had measured redshifts and peak luminosities .",
    "a correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 was apparent and significant at the 3.8@xmath7 credible level if nearby grb 980425 was excluded and 4.9@xmath7 credible level if grb 980425 was included .",
    "we did not model the data with a power law ( as guidorzi et al .  2005 claim ) , because the scatter of the data around such a model is more than can be accounted for by the data s statistical error bars alone .",
    "this scatter is called sample variance . consequently , we instead modeled the data with a normal distribution around a line in the @xmath8 plane .",
    "the width of this distribution , which can be parameterized by either @xmath9 or @xmath10 , measures the sample variance , and is sometimes called the `` slop '' parameter ( e.g. , reichart 2001 ; lee et al .",
    "2001 ; galama et al .",
    "2003 ; nysewander et al .",
    "fitting such a distribution to data with error bars in not one but two dimensions is non - trivial .",
    "however , we present a maximum - likelihood procedure for doing just this in  2.2.2 of reichart ( 2001 ) . applying",
    "this formalism yielded @xmath4 with a sample variance of @xmath5 .    using the measure of variability introduced by reichart et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , guidorzi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have expanded the size of the sample of grbs for which both variabilities and peak luminosities are known from 11 to 32 , primarily with beppossax grbm data , but also with hete-2 fregate , swift bat , cgro batse , wind konus , and ulysses grb data .",
    "they confirm the existence of a correlation , using pearson s @xmath11 , spearman s @xmath12 , and kendall s @xmath13 tests .",
    "they also find that the data are not well described by a power law ( @xmath14 or 1145 , depending on how they do the fit , for only 30 degrees of freedom ) , but incorrectly state that reichart et al .",
    "( 2001 ) had found this to be the case . although their fits are poor , they find that @xmath6 or @xmath15 , again depending on how they do the fit , with sample variance assumed to be zero .",
    "this is significantly different than what reichart et al .",
    "( 2001 ) found .",
    "some of the effects of not modeling sample variance when it is required can be seen in figures 1 and 2 : the dashed lines mark the center and 1@xmath7 width of the original best - fit distribution of reichart et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , and appear to remain an acceptable description of the data even though the sample has nearly tripled in size .",
    "we update this fit in  2 .",
    "the dotted lines are the best - fit power laws of guidorzi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , which do not appear to acceptably describe even the trend of the data .",
    "we now refit the model of reichart et al .",
    "( 2001 ) to the expanded data set of guidorzi et al .",
    ". however , we do not include grb 000210 in this fit : this grb is missing high time - resolution data for 2.5 sec during the peak of this @xmath16 sec long event and consequently should be viewed as only providing a lower limit to the variability .",
    "indeed , this grb is significantly less variable than all other grbs of comparable peak luminosity , typically by an order of magnitude . using the statistical formalism presented in reichart ( 2001 ) for fitting distributions to data with error bars in two dimensions , we find that @xmath2 with a sample variance of @xmath3 if we exclude grb 980425 from the fit and @xmath17 with a sample variance of @xmath18 if we include grb 980425 . the solid lines in figures 1 and 2 mark the centers and 1@xmath7 widths of the best - fit distributions , respectively .",
    "these distributions are in excellent agreement with out earlier work .",
    "if we also include grb 000210 , we find that @xmath19 with a sample variance of @xmath20 .",
    "this shows that the difference between our fits and those of guidorzi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) are not due to our exclusion of this point , but due to their exclusion of sample variance in their model .",
    "using a statistical formalism that is appropriate for this data set , we fit a distribution in the @xmath8 plane to the expanded data set of guidorzi et al .",
    "our findings are in excellent agreement with our earlier work , when the sample was approximately one - third its current size .",
    "the variability - luminosity correlation is now best described by @xmath2 with a sample variance of @xmath3 .",
