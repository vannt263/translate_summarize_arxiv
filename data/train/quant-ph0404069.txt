    "the quantification of entanglement is one of the most important problem in quantum information theory .",
    "the three most promising entanglement measures are the entanglement of formation , the entanglement of distillation @xcite and the relative entropy of entanglement @xcite . in the bipartite system ,",
    "the meaning of both entanglement of formation and the entanglement of distillation is quite clear .",
    "however , these two measures do not have an entirely straightforward meaning when one considers multi - partite entanglement @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the relative entropy of entanglement can easily be generalized to multi - partite system .",
    "recently , towards possible applications in quantum communication , both theoretical and experimental investigations increasingly focus on quantum states with a continuous spectrum defined in an infinite dimensional hilbert space .",
    "these states can be relatively easily generated using squeezed light and beam splitters .",
    "besides the research on the entanglement of bipartite continuous variable system , the non- locality of the multipartite entangled continuous - variable greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( cvghz ) states was proved @xcite .",
    "hence the quantification of the entanglement of cvghz states comes into our sight .",
    "now let us proceed to derive a simple cvghz mixed state and give out its upper bound of the relative entropy of entanglement .",
    "the continuous variable analogues to the multipartite entangled greenberger - horne - zeilinger states was proposed@xcite .",
    "the wigner function of the pure entangled m - mode state is ( with @xmath0 )    @xmath1    \\notag \\\\ & & -e^{2r}\\left [ \\frac{1}{m}\\left ( \\sum_{i=1}^{m}p_{i}\\right ) ^{2}+\\frac{1}{2m% } \\sum_{i , j}^{m}\\left ( x_{i}-x_{j}\\right ) ^{2}\\right ] \\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the correlation matrix ( cm ) of this state is @xmath2 the @xmath3 matrices @xmath4 and @xmath5 are in a special kind of form . if we define a @xmath3 matrix @xmath6 with its all diagonal elements being equal to @xmath7 all off - diagonal elements being equal to @xmath8 then @xmath9 @xmath10 .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath11 so that  @xmath12 .",
    "now we introduce the m - mode squeezed thermal state ( mst ) based on the pure entangled m - mode state .",
    "the cm of mst state is @xmath13 with @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the average photon number of thermal noise of every mode .",
    "then we have @xmath16 in the calculation of relative entropy between these gaussian states , we need the so called @xmath17 matrix which is the matrix in the exponential expression of density operator of gaussian state@xcite@xcite .",
    "it is related to the cm by a symplectic transformation @xmath18 .",
    "the cm can be diagonalized by symplectic transformation such that @xmath19 and @xmath20 @xmath21 ( with @xmath22 being diagonal ) .",
    "the procedure of obtaining the @xmath17 matrix is to explore the eigenfunctions of matrix @xmath23 of the state@xcite .",
    "but an unit matrix form of the matrix @xmath24 like in eq .",
    "( [ wave2 ] ) has not definite eigenfunctions . here",
    "the @xmath17 matrix is constructed directly by making use of eq .",
    "( [ wave1]).clearly the mst state we introduced is symmetric to all @xmath25 modes . so that @xmath26 will be in the form of    @xmath27    and @xmath28 from eq .",
    "( [ wave1 ] ) , we can write eq.([wave2 ] ) as @xmath29  and @xmath30 hence    @xmath31    the @xmath17 matrix will be    @xmath32    where @xmath33 the mst state we introduced",
    "is characterized by two parameters @xmath34 and @xmath35 when one of them is @xmath36the other one has a clear physical meaning : quantum correlation or noise . and",
    "when both of them are not @xmath37 , we will display with three mode state that it is the competition of the two parameters which will determine the state is authentically multipartite entangled or not .",
    "the separability problem of the three mode gaussian state was perfectly solved@xcite .",
    "i in this paper apply it in order to derive a simple criterion in the special case of 3st state(@xmath38 squeezed thermal state ) .",
    "the three mode gaussian states were classified as 5 different entangled classes . but 3st states can be classified as 3 different entangled classes : fully inseparable states , biseparable states , fully separable states . following the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite , the cm @xmath39 now is replaced with @xmath40 , where @xmath41 , and denote by @xmath42 the partial transposition in @xmath43s system only , @xmath44 is one of the three modes . denoting the partially transposed cm by @xmath45 and @xmath46 .\\ ] ] the criterion for fully inseparable state is    @xmath47    because of the symmetry of the 3st state , the criterion can be simplified to for example @xmath48 .",
    "this will lead to the condition that    @xmath49    while for @xmath50 @xmath51 the state which we will call it ppt trimode state can be biseparable or fully separable .",
    "the criterion to distinguish the biseparable and fully separable states is @xcite as follow .",
    "the cm @xmath52 of ppt trimode state can be written of as    @xmath53    where @xmath54 is a @xmath55  cm for the first mode , whereas @xmath56 is a @xmath57 cm for the other two modes .",
    "define the matrices @xmath58 and @xmath59 as    @xmath60    where @xmath61 is the partially transposed @xmath62 for two modes .",
    "then the condition of the ppt trimode state to be fully separable is that if and only if there exists a point @xmath63 fulfilling the following inequality :    @xmath64    where @xmath65 and @xmath66 if we write @xmath58 as    @xmath67    ineq.([wave5 ] ) restricts @xmath68 to a circular disk @xmath69 , while ineq.([wave6 ] ) and ineq.([wave7 ] ) describe ellipses @xmath70 and @xmath71 respectively .",
    "the existence of the point @xmath68 then turn out to be the intersection of the ellipses @xmath70 and @xmath71 and the circular disk @xmath69 . for 3st state , after lengthy algebra , ineq.([wave6 ] ) and ineq.([wave7 ] ) can be written of as @xmath72 respectively , where we denote @xmath73 @xmath74 and @xmath75 } { \\left ( t+\\frac 1t\\right ) ^2-\\frac 49\\left [ \\left ( s+\\frac 1s\\right ) ^2 + 5\\right ] } .\\ ] ] let us consider @xmath76 and @xmath77 , the borders of @xmath70 and @xmath78 , they are represented by the equality parts of ineq.([wave8 ] ) and ineq.([wave9 ] ) .",

    "( [ wave5 ] ) is also fulfilled , we just need that @xmath94 this can be verify numerically for all @xmath95 , although the analytical verification is possible .",
    "and the conclusion is that ineq .",
    "( ) fulfills for all @xmath96 the districts for fully separable , biseparable and fully inseparable states are displayed in fig.(1 ) .",
    "the relative entropy of entanglement for an arbitrary number of parties is defined by the following formula@xcite @xcite    @xmath97    where @xmath98 is a set of disentangled ( separable ) states and where latexmath:[$s(\\sigma    relative entropy . for the purpose of this paper ,",
    "we assume that @xmath98 is the set of the states that can be created locally , i.e. it is fully separable @xcite .",
    "also , by @xmath100 we will always denote the relative entropy of entanglement for n - party systems with respect to the set of fully separable states .",

    ", @xmath125 is better than @xmath126 as upper bound .",
    "the continuous variable analogues of the multipartite entangled greenberger - horne - zeilinger states had been introduced are pure states . in this paper",
    "we have discussed how to extend these pure states to the multipartite squeezed thermal states .",
    "the such obtained mst state are highly symmetric and it is characterized by only two parameters , one is the squeezing parameter and the other is for thermal noise .",
    "i have got the @xmath17 matrix ( matrix in the exponential expression of density operator of the state ) of the state in order that the relative entropy between the mst states can be calculated .",
    "the criterions of separability have been simplified for 3st states .",
    "the fully separable condition now takes a very simple form , that is if the noise is stronger than the squeezing , the state will be fully separable , otherwise it will be entangled ( biseparable or fully entangled ) .",
    "i have calculated the relative entropy between the 3st entangled state and 3st fully separable state and obtained an upper bound of the relative entropy of entanglement for 3st entangled state.the bound was compared with the bound obtained by teleportation consideration for pure 3st state .",
