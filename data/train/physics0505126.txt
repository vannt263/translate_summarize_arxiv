    "in recent years numeral lab - on - a - chip systems have been developed to analyze biological samples .",
    "many of these systems rely on handling of particles and cells comparable in size to the dimensions of the channels containing them .",
    "examples of such microsystems are bumperarrays or dep - systems  @xcite    it is a major challenge in theoretical microfluidics to study the dynamics of particles of finite size when they are convected by a fluid flow .",
    "especially problematic is the forces appearing during collisions of the particles with the walls of the channel .",
    "the level set method @xcite is well suited to cope with these problems . by introducing a hypersurface @xmath0 ,",
    "the particle interface is represented as the zero level set @xmath1 .",
    "the major advantage of the method is that this zero level set can be calculated implicitly instead of explicit tracking of the points on the interface .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : goveqns ] we state the equations governing the dynamics of the system and in sec .",
    "[ sec : levelset ] we derive the level set formulation for the tracked interface .",
    "the implementation of the method in the numerical simulation tool femlab  is described in sec .",
    "[ sec : femlab ] and we present results of a test study in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "finally , we evaluate the method in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] and give suggestions to future areas of usage .",
    "we consider microfluidic systems . hence the characteristic length scales of channels are of the order of 10  @xmath2 m which is well beyond the intermolecular distances characteristic of the fluids involved .",
    "thus the continuum hypothesis applies .",
    "moreover , in these systems the flow velocities are much smaller than the propagation of pressure ( the speed of sound ) .",
    "we can therefore consider the fluids to be incompressible and the continuity condition @xmath3 holds true for the velocity field @xmath4  of the fluid .",
    "consider a domain @xmath5 consisting of two subdomains @xmath6 and @xmath7 with surfaces @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively . the common boundary between @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the interface @xmath10 which we want to evolve .",
    "the rate of change of the momentum of the fluid is given by @xmath11 involving the substantial time derivative of @xmath4 .",
    "the change in momentum arises from the forces acting on the volume of fluid . in a microfluidic system",
    "we can neglect gravity and the only force @xmath12 acting on a volume of fluid @xmath5 stems from the stresses @xmath13 exerted by the surrounding liquid on the surface @xmath14 , @xmath15 where @xmath13 is the stress tensor modelled by @xmath16 newton s second law therefore takes the form @xmath17 the right hand side of this equation can be split up in three integrals ; two parts for each of the boundaries of the two subdomains and one along the common interface @xmath18\\nonumber\\\\ & = \\int_{\\omega_1}\\!{\\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{\\nabla}}}\\cdot{\\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}}{\\@ifnextchar^{\\diff}{\\diff^{}}}{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{r}}}+\\int_{\\omega_2}\\!{\\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{\\nabla}}}\\cdot{\\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}}{\\@ifnextchar^{\\diff}{\\diff^{}}}{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{r}}}+\\int_{\\gamma}\\!\\gamma\\kappa{\\@ifnextchar^{\\diff}{\\diff^{}}}{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{a}}}\\text{,}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the second equality we have used gauss theorem as well as the young  laplace law relating the pressure drop @xmath19 $ ] across the interface @xmath10 to the surface tension @xmath20 and average curvature @xmath21 .    to facilitate numerical computation",
    "it is desirable to rewrite the last integral in eq .   as a volume integral like the rest of the terms",
    "this can be achieved by introducing a level set function @xmath0 as we will show in the following .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite we introduce a level set function @xmath0 with the properties @xmath22 this function uniquely defines the interface as @xmath23 and permits us to distinguish each subdomain by the sign of @xmath24 .",
    "we also introduce a transverse level set function @xmath25 such that @xmath26 we show in appendix  [ app : proofs ] that it is possible to construct such level set functions . in the following we consider a two dimensional system , but the method is applicable in higher dimensions also .",
    "we can construct a global orientation - preserving diffeomorphism that maps @xmath27 through the variable change    [ eq : variable change ] @xmath28    we denote partial derivatives with indices , e.g. ,  @xmath29 .",
    "the change of variables eqs .",
    "is area preserving because the jacobian is non - zero , @xmath30 where we assume that @xmath31 is constructed such that @xmath32 is parallel to the tangent direction and therefore @xmath33 .",
    "furthermore we introduce a parameterization @xmath34 of @xmath10 , where @xmath35 is an arc - length variable . using this parameterization an infinitesimal change in @xmath36 along @xmath10",
    "is given by @xmath37 where we have utilized the above assumption that the gradient of @xmath31 is parallel to the tangent direction . with the above definitions we can rewrite the surface integral in eq .",
    "as @xmath38 where we have used that the normal @xmath39  to the interface can be written as @xmath40 .",
    "using eq .   for changing variables , eq .",
    "becomes @xmath41 inserting eq .   into eq .",
    "yields @xmath42{\\@ifnextchar^{\\diff}{\\diff^{}}}{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{r}}}\\text{.}\\ ] ] this must hold true for any volume @xmath5 . hence @xmath43 & = { \\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{\\nabla}}}\\cdot{\\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}}+\\gamma\\kappa\\delta(\\phi){\\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{\\nabla}}}\\phi\\text{,}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is the level set formulation of the navier  stokes equation .    in order to have the system completely described by dynamical equations",
    "we finally need an equation describing the evolution of the zero level set .",
    "we only need to consider the movement of the zero level set because this is the only part of the level set function with a physical interpretation . evolving",
    "the equation @xmath1 in time defines the movement of the front . differentiating with respect to time yields",
    "@xmath44 which is written as @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the velocity of the zero level set .",
    "requiring the velocity field to be continuous leads to @xmath47 , and the evolution equation for @xmath24 becomes @xmath48",
    "one of the great advantages of the level set formulation is that it does not track the interface explicitly but rather capture it implicitly .",
    "thereby we avoid to introduce explicit forces from the walls during collisions as they enter implicitly through the stress tensor @xmath13 and the no - slip boundary condition on the velocity field @xmath4 .",
    "furthermore , several numerical tools are available for solving the dynamical system . in this section",
    "we describe how we have implemented the level set method in the finite element software package femlab  @xcite .",
    "we have used the femlab  scripting language trough a matlabinterface in the general pde mode . here",
    "the pdes are given by    @xmath49    where the index @xmath50 is the variable counter , @xmath51 is the constraint number ( the number of boundaries ) and @xmath52 is the number space dimension number .",
    "the lagrange multipliers @xmath53 are chosen by femlab  in order to fulfill the constraints , while the scalars @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 are given by the physics of the problem .      introducing the characteristic length scale @xmath57 , velocity scale @xmath58 , density @xmath59 , viscosity @xmath60 and surface tension @xmath61 we can express the physical quantities as a dimensionless number times the characteristic scale . denoting the nondimensional quantities by a tilde we simply have @xmath62 similarly we can define the characteristic pressure and timescale as relations between the chosen characteristic parameters @xmath63 substituting eqs .   and   into the navier  stokes equation   yields @xmath64 = \\tilde{{\\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{\\nabla}}}}\\cdot\\tilde{{\\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma } } } } + \\frac{1}{{\\ensuremath{\\mathit{ca}}}}\\tilde{\\gamma}\\tilde{\\kappa}\\delta(\\phi)\\tilde{{\\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{\\nabla}}}}\\phi\\text{.}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the reynolds number @xmath65 is the ratio between inertial forces and viscous forces and the capillary number @xmath66 is the ratio between viscous forces and the surface tension forces .    rearranging the terms in eq .",
    "we find @xmath67 which is seen to be on the femlab  general form if    @xmath68    the density @xmath69 , viscosity @xmath70 and the curvature of the front @xmath71 are defined as auxiliary functions of the level set function @xmath24 . in a system with two immiscible incompressible fluids ( or a particle in a fluid )",
    "the density and viscosity are constant on each side of the interface .",
    "we can therefore define the dimensionless density and viscosity as @xmath72 where @xmath73 is a heaviside function defined as @xmath74 setting @xmath75 ensures that the density of the fluid is @xmath76 and @xmath77 in @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively . similarly setting @xmath78",
    "makes the viscosity of the fluid @xmath79 and @xmath80 in @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "the curvature of the zero level set is given by @xmath81 where @xmath82 is a unit normal vector to the interface  @xcite .",
    "when solving the system numerically the abrupt change in density and viscosity across the interface causes numerical instabilities to occur . in order to avoid this",
    "we substitute @xmath73 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 with the smeared out versions @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 defined as    @xmath88    this implies that the interface has a finite thickness @xmath89 approximately given by @xmath90      the dimensionless form of the continuity equation is @xmath91 which is entered into femlab  by choosing @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "the nondimensionalized form of the convection equation for the zero level set is @xmath96 which can be rearranged to @xmath97 and implemented in femlab  by setting @xmath98 , @xmath93 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    ".the parameter values used in the simulation of the test case .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , > , < \" , ]      it is necessary to maintain a uniform thickness of the interface throughout the calculations .",
    "this requires that the gradient of the level set function is constant within a region around the interface @xmath101 .",
    "this is not automatically fulfilled .",
    "the time evolution of any level set @xmath102 is given by the level set eq .  .",
    "this means that the height of the level set function will remain constant , but it does not ensure that the gradient does not change . thus in order to keep a fixed interface thickness we need to reinitialize the level set function without changing the zero level set .    in principle",
    "we can use any function that fulfills eq .",
    ", since only the zero level set has a physical interpretation .",
    "but requiring the interface thickness to be fixed constrains the gradient of @xmath24 to be fixed in a region around the interface .",
    "a choice of @xmath0 that fulfills these requirements is the signed distance function , where the distance is the shortest distance @xmath103 from a point to the interface @xmath104 @xmath105 being the points on the interface .",
    "the plus sign applies if @xmath106 and the minus sign if @xmath107 .",
    "the length of the gradient for this particular choice of level set function is @xmath108 with the initial condition @xmath109 and @xmath110 being a pseudotime .",
    "the steady state solution to this equation is the reinitialized level set function . because numerical oscillations can occur if the sign of @xmath24 changes abruptly at the interface it is necessary to use the smeared out sign function given in eq .  .",
    "the reinitialization equation is already on a form suitable for implementation in femlab . simply letting @xmath111 equal the right hand side of the equation and setting @xmath99 and @xmath93 with @xmath112 does the trick .    to avoid mass loss during the reinitialisation procedure",
    "we have put a constraint on the solution : the volume of the particle must be constant at all time .",
    "this is done in femlab  via the field ` fem.equ.constr ` where we constrain the difference between the integrals of the smeared out heaviside function @xmath113 at time @xmath110 and the smeared out heaviside function @xmath85 at time @xmath114 to be zero .",
    "the integrals are computed by using the integration coupling variables in femlab .",

    "the viscosity @xmath80 of the particle was @xmath120 times larger than the viscosity @xmath79 of the fluid .",

    "the fluid velocity field is periodic from top to bottom of the domain and is driven by a pressure difference @xmath121 .",
    "we ran a series of simulations with the shape of the obstacle changing from circular to quadratic by changing the radius of the rounded obstacle corner @xmath115 .",
    "each simulation consisted of a series of runs with different initial horizontal position @xmath118 of the particles and the initial vertical position of the particles was @xmath122 from the top of the channel . when the center of a convected particle is @xmath50 from the bottom of the channel the final horizontal position @xmath123 is detected ( fig .",

    "the difference in horizontal position is almost zero for the particles started in at the greatest distance from the center of the channel , independent of the shape of the obstacle .",
    "as the initial position gets closer to the center of the channel the difference in horizontal position becomes larger and the round obstacles tend not to drag as much in the particles as the square obstacles yielding a larger difference in the horizontal position .",
    "[ fig : path6_10 ] shows that our implementation of the level set method is capable of coping with the interaction forces between the stable obstacles and the moving particles automatically .",

    "one promising reinitialisation scheme is the particle level set method suggested by enright _",

    "however also other forces such as dep forces or magnetic forces could be taken into account making the method applicable for simulations of many lab - on - a - chip systems fabricated today .",

    "now all we need to prove is that @xmath154 and @xmath32 are orthogonal and that @xmath155 .",
    "the orthogonality can be proved by differentiating @xmath31 with respect to @xmath110 , @xmath156 which means that @xmath24 and @xmath31 are orthogonal if and only if @xmath155 .",
    "this follows immediately from differentiating @xmath31 with respect to @xmath35 , @xmath157 because @xmath143 was chosen to be an increasing function .",
