    "one of the main goals of radio astronomy is to fully understand the physics of the population of extragalactic radio sources ( rss ) .",
    "issues include the onset and demise of the radio activity and related starbursts , the influence of the environment on the characteristics of the rss and the appearance of the first rss and their relation to the formation of galaxies , massive black holes and the reionization of the universe .",
    "detailed investigation of complete samples of bright rss with redshift information have been carried out over the last decades ( e.g. , 3crr : laing , riley & longair 1983 ; 6ce : eales 1985 , eales et al .",
    "1997 , rawlings , eales & lacy 2001 ) and led to many interesting discoveries .",
    "for example , it is now well established that the comoving number density of @xmath9 powerful rss is about two orders of magnitude larger than it is locally ( e.g. , longair 1966 , dunlop & peacock 1990 ) . another example is that the environment of rss changes with redshift , with bright rss at higher redshifts located in denser environments than locally ( e.g. , best , longair & rttgering 1998 ) .    through the selection of rss that are bright and have very steep radio spectra ( @xmath10 ) , more than 150 powerful galaxies with @xmath11 have been found @xcite .",
    "the large starformation rates @xcite and extremely clumpy optical / ir morphologies @xcite provide strong evidence that these galaxies are massive galaxies close to the epoch of formation .",
    "powerful radio emission is most likely caused by accretion onto massive black holes ( m@xmath12 m@xmath13 ; mclure et al .",
    "1999 , laor 2000 ) , indicating that such massive black holes formed alongside or possibly before the formation epoch of their host galaxies ( e.g. , kauffmann & haehnelt 2000 ) .",
    "recent @xmath14  observations have revealed the existence of a large scale structure of ly-@xmath15 emitting galaxies around the radio galaxy 1138@xmath16262 ( @xmath17 ) , reinforcing the idea that high redshift radio galaxies ( hzrgs ) can be used as tracers of proto - clusters of galaxies @xcite .    at very faint flux densities ( e.g. ,",
    "a few tens of @xmath4jy  at 1.4 ghz ) the radio source counts are dominated by the @xmath18 starburst population ( e.g. , richards et al . 1999 ) .",
    "long observations with the @xmath19  + @xmath20  @xcite and @xmath1@xcite reach such faint levels , and have enabled important constraints to be placed upon the redshifts and nature of distant starburst galaxies .",
    "our @xmath1  survey reaches a 1@xmath21 detection threshold of 28 @xmath4jy  at 1.4 ghz , within a factor of 2 - 3 of the deepest radio observations carried out so far ( cf . windhorst et al .",
    "1999 , richards 2000 ) .",
    "the surveyed area is , however , large enough ( about 7 square degrees ) to yield enough sources to not be severely affected by low number statistics for the rs populations under scrutiny . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ specpop ] , the composition of the radio population changes dramatically towards lower flux density limits .",
    "the higher flux levels are dominated by rss with steep spectra ( @xmath22 ) , and a cross - over to flat - spectrum sources appears to occur at the 10 - 100 mjy ( at 325 mhz ) level .",
    "the former are mostly identified with ( powerful ) radio sources residing in massive ellipticals ( e.g. , eales et al . 1997 ) , whereas the latter can be tied to a population of starforming late - type galaxies , especially towards sub - mjy 1.4 ghz flux density levels ( e.g. , windhorst 1999 , richards et al . 1999 ) .",
    "therefore , deeper observations will not only increase the number of detected sources , but it will also provide a better handle on the relative makeup of the radio population at @xmath4jy  flux density levels .    the radio source population properties do not only change as a function of flux density , they also vary with redshift . using radio luminosity functions for agn @xcite and starbursting populations @xcite",
    ", we can model the expected source counts for a given redshift ( and limiting flux density ) .",
    "this is plotted in fig .",
    "[ zdistpred ] for a limiting flux density of 140@xmath4jy . beyond a redshift of @xmath23",
    "the number counts for our survey are expected to be dominated by the agn population .",
    "the combination of information presented in figs .",
    "[ specpop ] and [ zdistpred ] makes it clear how dependent on limiting flux density a perceived radio source population is .",
    "indeed , for a limiting flux density of 1 mjy ( at 1.4 ghz ) the population is dominated by agn - type sources at all redshifts @xcite .",
    "the survey can detect radio sources at the fr  i / fr  ii break level ( 10@xmath24 w hz@xmath25 at 1400 mhz , owen & white 1991 ) out to a redshift=65 km s@xmath25 mpc@xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 throughout this paper . ] of @xmath28 .",
    "fainter fr  i type sources with a mean radio power of 10@xmath29 w hz@xmath25 drop out of the sample around @xmath30 , and the much fainter starforming systems will not be detected beyond @xmath31 at the 10@xmath32 w hz@xmath25 level .",
    "the local starbursting system m82 has , for comparison , a radio spectral power of @xmath33 w hz@xmath25 , given its 1400 mhz flux density of 8.363 jy @xcite and the adopted cosmology .",
    "thus the survey provides ample data for evolutionary studies of _ radio loud _",
    "systems out to at least a redshift of 1 , whereas a more complete census of radio sources down to the spiral / starburst level has to be limited to sources within @xmath34 .",
    "key ingredients for follow - up studies are optical / near - infrared identifications and redshift information for at least a large fraction of the radio sources . for this purpose a number of other surveys are either being carried out or are planned for the same part of the sky .",
    "these include :    _ the @xmath35  deep wide - field survey _ ( pi s jannuzi and dey ) .",
    "this survey consists of a northern and a southern part , with the former field located in bootes ( near the north galactic pole ) , covering a @xmath36 degree region , and the latter located in a @xmath37 degree equatorial region in cetus .",
    "both fields have been selected for their low mid- to far - infrared cirrus emission , their low h  i column densities and the availability of high resolution ( @xmath38 ) @xmath19   @xmath39  survey radio data .",
    "of particular interest to our program is the bootes field , which will be imaged to a limiting surface brightness of about 28@xmath40 magnitude per square arcsecond in @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 , and down to @xmath44 magnitude per square arcsec in @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 .",
    "these detection limits will permit the optical and near - infrared study of faint , sub - l@xmath48 galaxies out to redshifts of about unity ( an l@xmath48 galaxy will have @xmath49 at @xmath50 , based on an absolute magnitude of @xmath51 , cf .",

    "given our radio source population mix of powerful radio sources associated with intrinsically bright galaxies at high redshift and less luminous starforming systems at much lower redshifts , we expect to be able to detect optical / near - infrared counterparts for most of them .",

    "_ the @xmath53  shallow survey _ ( pi .",

    "the bootes field will be covered by @xmath54 s infrared array camera ( @xmath53 ) in four ir bands ranging from 3.6@xmath4 m to 8@xmath4 m .",
    "coverage towards the longer ir bands up to 160@xmath4 m will be provided by the multiband imaging photometer ( @xmath55 ) , and some spectroscopy by the infrared spectrograph ( @xmath56 , pi in both cases is j. houck ) .",
    "the @xmath35  and @xmath54  wide field surveys are aimed to study , among other things , ( i ) the evolution of large - scale structure from @xmath57 , ( ii ) the formation and evolution of ellipticals and starforming galaxies , and ( iii ) the detection of very distant ( @xmath58 ) young galaxies and quasars . the @xmath54  irac and mips observations will also detect star - forming galaxies at mid- to far - infrared wavelengths .",
    "it is this multi - wavelength aspect of the project , covering a large fraction of the electromagnetic spectrum ( 2 radio frequencies , several optical and near - infrared bands , and the mid- to far - infrared space based @xmath54  observations ) that distinguishes this effort from other deep radio - optical / near - infrared surveys like the phoenix survey , @xcite , and the australia telescope eso slice project ( atesp ) @xcite .",
    "the bootes field has been covered by previous radio surveys , most notably by the westerbork northern sky survey ( @xmath59 , rengelink et al .",
    "1997 ) at 325 mhz , by the @xmath60  @xmath19  sky survey ( @xmath61 , condon et al . 1998 ) , and by the faint images of the radio sky at twenty - cm survey ( @xmath39 , becker et al .",
    "1995 ) , both at 1.4 ghz . a comparison between the literature surveys and our bootes surveys ( @xmath1  at 1.4 ghz in this paper , and @xmath19  325 mhz ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ surveycomp ] , and tabulated in table  1 .",
    "the varying survey depths and frequencies make combining catalogs to obtain spectral index information less than straightforward . for instance , combining @xmath61  and @xmath62  ( at 5 ghz , gregory & condon 1991 ) only makes sense if one is interested in radio sources with strongly inverted spectra . for our purpose , since the bulk of the radio source population has a spectral index of around @xmath63 ( cf .",
    "[ spixdist ] ) , a combination of surveys like the @xmath59  and @xmath61  / @xmath39  is best , as can be inferred from the overplotted common radio spectra in fig .",

    "however , these surveys do not go deep enough to effectively probe the transition in radio source population occurring around the 1 mjy level ( cf .",
    "[ specpop ] , [ dnds ] , and , e.g. , windhorst et al .",
    "our @xmath1  observations do go deep enough , but will need low frequency data of matching sensitivity .",
    "we use the @xmath19  at 325 mhz for this purpose , and the data from this program will be described in an subsequent paper . however , both the @xmath61  and @xmath39  survey data have been used to calibrate our survey flux densities and positions ( cf .",
    "sections  [ fluxacc ] and [ posacc ] ) .",
    "the observations were carried out by the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( @xmath1 ) operating at 1.380 ghz .",
    "the @xmath1  consists of 14 25 m telescopes , arranged in a 2.7 km east - west configuration . as the back - end",
    ", we used the digital continuum backend ( @xmath64 ) with 8 sub - bands of 10 mhz bandwidth each .",
    "the smallest baseline ( 9@xmath16a ) was set to 54 m to limit shadowing at the expense of a reduction in large spatial structure sensitivity ( @xmath65 for this minimum baseline and frequency ) .",
    "we designed a survey layout consisting of 42 discrete pointings .",
    "the separation between the grid points was chosen to be 60%  of the @xmath66  of the primary beam . given the used tiling and the known attenuation of the beam , a more or less uniform noise - background is obtained with this spacing ( 85%  of the survey area has a local rms within @xmath67 , cf .",
    "sect  [ complreliab ] and fig .  [ noisemap ] ) .",
    "this strategy is similar to the one used for the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) atesp survey ( see prandoni et al .",
    "2000a for a detailed description ) .",
    "the total number of pointings ( 42 ) was dictated by the need to cover the 325 mhz @xmath19  primary beam with a uniform sensitivity ( noise ) level .    during each observing block of 12 hours",
    ", the telescopes were continuously cycled between 3 individual grid positions .",
    "this `` mosaicing '' mode @xcite allows multiple fields to be observed , while still retaining a 12 hour @xmath68-coverage for the fields individually ( albeit sampled non - continuously ) .",
    "the basic integration time for the observations is 10 seconds .",
    "a typical observing cycle can be broken down to a 10s slew - time between the grid positions , and @xmath69s on - source time . even though the net slewing time is less than 10s , some extra time is needed for the array to settle itself after the move .",
    "the observing efficiency with this scheme is therefore 83.3% resulting in @xmath70 net observing time per 12 hour cycle . given the total allocated time for this project ( 192 hours ) , we used the remaining two 12 hour blocks to cycle through _ all _ 42 positions . in this setup , each position was revisited every 42 minutes ( instead of every 3 minutes ) , resulting in a rather sparse @xmath68-sampling and less than @xmath71 on - source time per block .",
    "each 12 hour block was sandwiched between two phase and polarization calibrators , typically 3c  286 and 3c  147 , more than adequate given the system stability .",
    "a log of the observations can be obtained from the ftp - site ( cf .",
    "sect  [ ftpsite ] ) .",
    "the mosaic was reduced , calibrated , and assembled using the miriad @xcite software package .",
    "the data was typically of high quality , and only a few percent had to be flagged . usually the bad data was concentrated in channel 5 ( of the 8) , which , around 1380 mhz , is the frequency band most affected by interference due to the global positioning system .",
    "every field pointing was mapped using a multi frequency synthesis approach , where the measurements of the 8 bands individually are gridded simultaneously in the uv plane .",
    "this significantly reduces bandwidth smearing problems .",
    "then a three step iterative phase self - calibration cycle was used , using typically around 100000 clean iterations .",
    "the clean was done down to the 3 sigma level , so as not to incorporate too much flux in faint sources that does not belong there . in the few fields with strong sources present we performed amplitude self calibration as well , in all other cases",
    "this did not improve the final outcome . in the fourth , and final cycle ,",
    "spectral index effects on beam - shape were taken into account @xcite .",
    "the final maps improved significantly by correcting for the small primary beam shape variations across the 8 10 mhz wide frequency channels .",
    "after all the field pointings were reduced in this manner , they were assembled into a final mosaic .",
    "this step basically adds up the maps after performing the proper primary beam correction . since the dirty beam changes slightly across the field , we restored all the data with a fixed synthesized beam of @xmath72 , at a position angle of zero degrees .",
    "the mosaic was then further mapped onto @xmath73 pixels , for a total of @xmath74 pixels .",
    "we used automated routines for the source extraction and catalog creation .",
    "these were slightly modified from their @xmath59counterparts , but the applied methods are exactly the same , all of which are described in detail in @xcite .",
    "the software works on rectangular patches of sky only , so we tiled the circular overall shape of the survey into three rectangular areas , as outlined in fig .",
    "[ noisemap ] .",
    "all of the low noise areas have been included this way , and only a few parts of the noisy edges have not been cataloged .",
    "the total cataloged survey area covers 6.68 square degrees .",
    "part of the catalog , to illustrate its format , has been listed in table  2 .",
    "the full version ( with 3172 sources ) can be obtained through anonymous ftp to ftp://ftp.nfra.nl/pub/bootes . the complete mosaic , individual pointing maps , and tables with various additional data are available from the same address , all of which are described in the readme file .",
    "we have compared the flux densities of unresolved sources present in both our uncalibrated bootes and the @xmath61  catalog .",
    "since the resolution of @xmath61  ( at 45 ) is slightly worse than ours ( @xmath6 ) , a source which is unresolved in our catalog is consequently unresolved in @xmath61 .",
    "while we could compare our fluxes to the deeper @xmath39  data , the latter s much higher angular resolution typically resolves point sources in our catalog , making a direct comparison difficult .",
    "the results of the comparison are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fluxcomp ] .",

    "below these fluxes , the @xmath61values are systematically too high , and are presumably due to a combination of malmquist and clean biases .",

    "<S> we present the results from our deep ( 16@xmath012 hour ) westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( @xmath1 ) observations of the approximately 7 square degree bootes deep field , centered at @xmath2 , @xmath3 ( j2000 ) . </S>",
    "<S> our survey consists of 42 discrete pointings , with enough overlap to ensure a uniform sensitivity across the entire field , with a limiting sensitivity of 28@xmath4jy  ( 1@xmath5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the catalog contains 3172 distinct sources , of which 316 are resolved by the @xmath6 beam . </S>",
    "<S> the bootes field is part of the optical / near - infrared imaging and spectroscopy survey effort conducted at various institutions . </S>",
    "<S> the combination of these data sets , and the deep nature of the radio observations will allow unique studies of a large range of topics including the redshift evolution of the luminosity function of radio sources , the k-@xmath7 relation and the clustering environment of radio galaxies , the radio / far - infrared correlation for distant starbursts , and the nature of obscured radio loud @xmath8 . </S>"
