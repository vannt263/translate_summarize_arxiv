    "the transitional and pre - transitional disks are protoplanetary disks around young stars which exhibit strong dust emission at wavelengths @xmath4 m , while showing significantly reduced fluxes relative to typical t tauri disks at shorter wavelengths ( e.g. , strom et al .  1989 , calvet et al .  2002 , 2005 ;",
    "dalessio et al .  2005 ; espaillat et al .  2007 , 2008 ) .",
    "pre - transitional disks still have some infrared emission from warm , optically - thick dust near the star ( espaillat et al .  2007 , 2008 , 2010 ) , while transitional disks only have near- and mid - infrared emission from optically - thin dust ( calvet et al .",
    "2002 , 2005 ; espaillat et al .",
    "the depletion of near- to mid - infrared emission is generally interpreted as being due to evacuation of the disk interior to scales @xmath5 to @xmath6  au ( marsh & mahoney 1992 ; calvet et al .  2002 , 2005 ;",

    "2006 ; brown et al .  2007 , 2009 ; hughes et al .",
    "2009 ; andrews et al .  2009 , 2011 ) .",
    "these cavities need to be both _",
    "large _ and _ deep _ concerning the dust surface density ( e.g. espaillat et al .",
    "2010 ) . here _",
    "deep _ means the gap is optically thin at mid - ir . in the case of the transitional disks ,",
    "the optically - thin region must extend from radii as large as tens of au all the way in to the central star , forming a dust hole .",
    "even the pre - transitional disks , which display evidence of optically - thick dust emission in the innermost regions , must have large disk gaps from @xmath7au scales to tens of au .",
    "the requirement that the gaps / holes are optically thin implies that the population of dust in sizes of order a micron or less must be extremely small , due to the large opacity of these small dust grains .",
    "furthermore , many of these objects also exhibit gas accretion rates comparable to but slightly smaller than t tauri disk accretion rates ( @xmath8@xmath9 ; hartmann et al . 1998 ) onto their central stars ( e.g. calvet et al .  2002 , 2005 ;",
    "espaillat et al .  2007 , 2008 ;",
    "najita et al .",
    "2007 ) . maintaining this accretion",
    "requires a significant mass reservoir in the inner disk .",
    "the conflict between the moderate disk accretion rate ( which means a high gas surface density ) and the near - infrared deficit ( which means a low dust density ) puts strong constraints on any theoretical attempts to explain these objects ( zhu et al .",
    "2011 ) .    in summary , there are three observational constraints for ( pre)transitional disks : 1 ) a wide gap / hole extending over one order of magnitude in radii , 2 ) a deep gap / hole that is optically thin , and 3 ) a moderate gas accretion rate .",
    "gap opening by multiple giant planets ( zhu et al .",
    "2011 , dodson - robinson & salyk 2011 ) has been proposed to explain the wide gaps in ( pre)transitional disks . however , zhu et al .",
    "( 2011 ) also pointed out that even with four giant planets , the opened gap is not deep enough to explain transitional disks , unless there are massive giant planets close to the central star .",
    "zhu et al .  ( 2011 ) concluded that dust depletion / growth is still required in the inner disk to be consistent with observations . on the other hand",
    ", dodson - robinson & salyk ( 2011 ) speculated that dust may be significantly confined in the spiral density wakes or streamers . both of these works",
    "imply that dust dynamics may need to be considered along with the gas dynamics .    by considering dust dynamics independently , one promising mechanism to explain these wide and deep ( dust ) gaps / holes",
    "is dust filtration by the gap outer edge opened by planet(s ) ( paardekooper & mellema 2006 , rice et al .",
    "this mechanism is intrinsically due to the dust being a pressureless system , while the gas orbital dynamics is affected by the gas pressure .",
    "dust particles orbit the central star at the keplerian speed , but the gas rotates slightly faster or slower than this depending on the radial pressure gradient . in this case the dust particles feel either a headwind or tailwind from the gas particles and can lose or gain angular momentum to the gas and start drifting radially in the disk .",
    "the net effect is that dust particles tend to drift toward gas pressure maxima .",
    "thus , at the outer edge of a planet - induced gap where the radial density / pressure gradient is positive , dust particles drift outwards , possibly overcoming their coupling to the inward gas accretion process .",
    "dust particles will then stay at the gap outer edge while the gas flows through the gap .",
    "this process is called dust filtration ( rice et al .",
    "2006 ) , and it depletes the disk interior to the radius of the planet - induced gap of dust , forming a dust - depleted inner cavity .    however , this filtration process sensitively depends on the pressure gradient at the planet - induced gap outer edge and it only operates for large particles whose drift velocities are significant .",
    "small particles strongly coupled to the gas flow can still penetrate the planet - induced gap to the inner disk .",
    "more importantly , dust diffusion may significantly reduces the filtration efficiency even for the big particles ( ward 2009 ) .",
    "thus it is crucial to understand what sized particles can be filtered by a realistic planet - induced gap . in this paper",
    ", we will show only 0.1 mm particles and above can be filtered by a realistic gap if the disk viscosity parameter @xmath0=0.01 and accretion rate @xmath1 .",
    "this size limit may decrease to 0.01 mm if the planet is very massive and the disk is less turbulent accreting at a low accretion rate .",
    "although this can explain the cavity from submm observations of transitional disks , it can not explain the near - ir deficit of these disks , given that significant small - dust is still present in the inner disk . however , on the other hand , if dust filtration is combined with dust growth in the disk , the near - ir deficit of transitional disks can be very well reproduced .    in  2",
    ", we introduce the two - dimensional two - fluid simulations . in  3 ,",
    "we construct a simpler one dimensional model .",
    "our results are presented in  4 .",
    "a short discussion is presented in  5 . various scenarios trying to explain",
    "transitional disks are tested with the monte - carlo radiative transfer model in  6 , and conclusions are drawn in  7 .",
    "in this section , we will first introduce our 2-fluid numerical algorithms , and then introduce our special inner boundary condition to study long timescale disk evolution . after a short discussion on the numerical challenging of simulating dust fluid , we set - up our gas / dust 2-fluid simulations .",
    "gaseous and dust components of the disk are simulated separately in our simulations .",
    "the gas disk evolution is simulated with fargo ( masset 2000 ) , a two - dimensional hydrodynamic code which utilizes a fixed grid in cylindrical polar coordinates ( r , @xmath10 ) .",
    "fargo uses finite differences to approximate derivatives , and the evolution equations are divided into source and transport steps , similar to those of zeus ( stone et al .",
    "however , an orbital advection scheme has been incorporated which reduces the numerical diffusivity and significantly increases the allowable timestep as limited by the courant - friedrichs - lewy ( cfl ) condition .",
    "thus fargo enables us to study the interaction between the disk and embedded planets over a full viscous timescale for disks .",
    "the set - up of the gaseous disk and the planet is discussed in  2.4.1 .      beyond the gas component , we have implemented an additional fluid in fargo to simulate the dust s response to the gas .",
    "the dust is treated as a low pressure fluid and couples with the gas via drag terms .",
    "no feedback from the dust on the gas is simulated , since dust filtration normally takes place when the gas density dominates the dust density .",
    "however , this assumption may be violated under some circumstances as discussed in  5.4 .",
    "the drift terms are added as an additional source step for the dust fluid @xmath11 @xmath12 where all other terms / steps are the same as the gaseous fluid ( stone & norman 1992 ) . since we will focus on dust particles with radii smaller than 1 mm , these particles are in the epstein regime ( whipple 1972 , weidenschilling 1977 ) , so that the dust stopping time ( takeuchi & lin , 2002 ) is @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the gas density , s is the dust particle radius , @xmath15 is the dust particle density ( we chose @xmath15=1 g @xmath16 ) , v@xmath17=@xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the gas sound speed . considering the mean disk density is @xmath20 , it can also be written as @xmath21 in a dimensionless form the stopping time can be written as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the keplerian angular velocity .",
    "when the dust stopping time is far shorter than the hydro time step , the drift terms become stiff . with an explicit method ,",
    "the time step @xmath24 t needs to be smaller than both the stopping time t@xmath25 , and the hydro time step constraint @xmath26 t in order to be numerically stable .",
    "however , t@xmath25 is very small with micron size particles , thus an implicit method is desired . considering that",
    "the zeus / fargo scheme is first order accurate in time , the first order implicit scheme is @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes the quantities at the new time step . since the drift term is stiff , it may be helpful if we go to a higher order scheme .",
    "it turns out that the second order scheme just requires replacing the @xmath29 in the denominator with @xmath30 .",
    "although the implicit method ensures a stable scheme no matter what the time step we use , equation [ eq : imp ] suggests it merely adds @xmath29 to the stopping time .",
    "the new equivalent stopping time is @xmath31 which can be significantly larger than the real @xmath32 if the numerical time step is much larger than @xmath32 .",
    "thus in order to accurately study the dust drift which is controlled by @xmath32 , the hydro time step needs to be comparable to @xmath32 . by numerical testing",
    "we found that the radial drift velocity is close to the theoretical value only if the time step is close to @xmath32 .",
    "we tried different schemes as mentioned above , but they differ little .",
    "thus , to simulate the dynamics of dust particles much smaller than 1 mm correctly , the time step is set by the dust stopping time and is inversely proportional to the particle size .",
    "simulating dust drift for 0.01 mm particles is thus very computationally expensive since it is 100 times more expensive than simulating 1 mm particles .",
    "on the other hand , we are not interested in dust dynamics happening on the dust stopping timescale .",
    "we are only interested in the dust s final response to the gas flow which changes on a much longer timescale than the stopping time .",
    "in other words , we can use the dust s terminal velocity to represent its final response to the gas .",
    "this is introduced as the `` short friction time approximation '' ( sft ) in johansen & klahr ( 2005 ) , where the dust velocity is related with the gas velocity as @xmath33 this approximation is valid only if t@xmath25 is much smaller than the dynamical timescale of the gas flow .",
    "more accurately , t@xmath25 needs to be smaller than the hydrodynamic time step . in our simulation set - up ,",
    "even with 1 mm particles , t@xmath25 is at least one order of magnitude smaller than the hydrodynamic time step . in the appendix",
    "we compare the sft approximation with the two - fluid simulation and show good agreement between them .    furthermore",
    ", dust can diffuse in the gaseous disk due to turbulence . in this work dust diffusion",
    "is implemented in the operator split fashion in the source step for the dust fluid ( clarke & pringle 1988 ) @xmath34 where d is the turbulent diffusivity which relates with the turbulent viscosity @xmath35 through @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the schmidt number defined as the ratio between the total accretion stress and particle mass diffusivity .",
    "note that @xmath35 here is the viscosity of the ` gaseous ' disk , representing the efficiency of the angular momentum transport experienced by the gas disk due to disk turbulence . when the disk orbital time ( which is close to the turbulent eddy turnover time ) is much larger than the dust stopping time ( which is always true for particles smaller than @xmath38  mm ) , @xmath391 ( johansen & klahr 2005 , carballido et al . 2011 ) and dust will not settle significantly so that 2-d approximation is better justified .",
    "the above formula for dust diffusion has been confirmed by both analytic work and numerical simulations including both mri turbulence and particle dynamics under the circumstances that the background gas surface density is uniform ( youdin & lithwick 2007 , carballido et al .",
    "2011 ) . in  4 ,",
    "we discuss how diffusion plays a significant role in the dust filtration process .      for the gaseous fluid , as discussed by crida , morbidelli , & masset ( 2007 ) , a standard open inner boundary condition ( stone et al .",
    "1992 ) in a fixed 2d grid can produce an unphysically rapid depletion of material through the inner boundary in the presence of the planets .",
    "there are two reasons for this .",
    "first , due to waves excited by the planet , the gas in the disk can have periodic inward and outward radial velocities larger than the net viscous velocity of accreting material . thus",
    ", with the normal open boundary , material can flow inward while there is no compensating outflow allowed .",
    "second , the orbit of the gas at the inner boundary is not circular due to the gravitational potential of the planets ; again , as material can not pass back out through the inner boundary , rapid depletion of the inner disk material is enhanced . as we are interested in the amount of gas depletion in the disk inward of the planet - induced gap(s ) over substantial evolutionary timescales , it is important to avoid or minimize this unphysical mass depletion .",
    "crida et al .",
    "( 2007 ) were able to ameliorate this problem by surrounding the 2d grid by extended 1d grids ( fargo2d1d , see their figure 5 ) .",
    "we follow pierens & nelson ( 2008 ) , who found reasonable agreement with the crida et al .",
    "results while using a 2d grid only by limiting the inflow velocities at the inner boundary to be no more than 3 times larger than the viscous radial velocity in a steady state , @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the viscosity and radius at the inner boundary .",
    "this scheme shows good agreement with the analytic estimate and the results from fargo2d1d model ( pierens & nelson 2008 , zhu et al .",
    "2011 ) .    for the dust fluid ,",
    "we adopt a similar approach by limiting the radial velocity of the dust fluid to be no more than 3 times larger than the dust drift speed in a viscous disk , @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the ratio between the pressure gradient and gravitational force @xmath44 = @xmath45 , and it is equal to 3/2(h / r)@xmath46 in our set - up below",
    ".      a zero pressure fluid means zero scale height , which implies any velocity disturbance in the disk will quickly sharpen and shock , known as the delta shock . in reality",
    ", a shock wo nt form in the particle fluid if there is a strong coupling between gas and dust . numerically",
    "due to the inability to simulate coupling on scales smaller than the grid , a zigzag shaped density profile forms grid by grid in our simulations and we rely on the artificial viscosity to stabilize the shock . to minimize this effect ,",
    "a small pressure is applied to the dust fluid here , which makes the scheme robust but it also introduces limitations as described below .    after numerical tests , we chose the dust scale height h@xmath47/r=0.0044 for the dust fluid , which is one order of magnitude smaller than the gaseous fluid ( h / r=0.044 ) .",
    "h@xmath47 is close to our grid spacing , while significantly smaller than the gas disk scale height .",
    "since dust drift is intrinsically due to the gaseous disk pressure gradient , adding 10@xmath48 pressure to the dust fluid means the drift speed is only affected by 10@xmath48 .",
    "but if the dust fluid has a sudden density change ( e.g. 10 times steeper than the gaseous fluid ) the effect of the small pressure can be amplified and becomes erroneous .",
    "similar to zhu et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , we assume a central stellar mass of @xmath49 and a fully viscous disk . we further assume a radial temperature distribution @xmath50  k , which is roughly consistent with typical t tauri disks in which irradiation from the central star dominates the disk temperature distribution ( e.g. , dalessio et al .",
    "the disk is vertically isothermal .",
    "the adopted radial temperature distribution corresponds to an implicit ratio of disk scale height to cylindrical radius @xmath51 .",
    "this differs from the @xmath52  constant assumption used in many previous simulations , which implies a temperature distribution @xmath53 , which is inconsistent with observations .",
    "consequently , our assumed temperature distribution with a constant viscosity parameter @xmath0 ( @xmath54 , where @xmath35 is the kinematic viscosity , @xmath55 is the sound speed , @xmath23 is the angular velocity ) leads to a steady - disk surface density distribution @xmath56 instead of the @xmath57 which would result from either assuming both @xmath58 and @xmath3 are constant , or both @xmath35 and viscous torque ( -2@xmath59 ) are constant .",
    "this makes a significant difference in the innermost disk surface densities , and thus the implied inner disk optical depths in our models will be larger .",
    "we set @xmath60 for the standard cases . given our assumed disk temperature distribution , we set the initial disk surface density to be @xmath61=178 ( r / au)@xmath62exp(-r/100 au ) g @xmath63 from @xmath64  au , which yields a steady disk solution with an accretion rate @xmath65 , typical of t tauri disks ( gullbring et al .  1998 ; hartmann et al .  1998 ) .",
    "the dust surface density is assumed to be 0.01 of the gas surface density initially . with this set up , the dust stopping time @xmath66 .",
    "motivated by ( pre-)transitional disk observations , we place the planet at 20 au .",
    "we have carried out two - fluid simulations , with a 1 m@xmath67 planet in the gaseous and dust disk ( 1 mm particles ) to 2.5@xmath6810@xmath69 years , using two methods for the dust fluid : 1 ) self - consistently solving the dust fluid equations together with the gas equations , or 2 ) using the sft approximation ( equation [ eq : eqsft ] ) . in the following",
    "we will refer to the former as two - fluid simulations , and the second method as the sft approximation ( although the second method is also a two - fluid method ) .",
    "good agreement has been found between these two methods ( see appendix ) .",
    "since the sft approximation is not limited by the dust stopping time , we use this approximation for the dust component in all the other runs .    finally , gaseous and dust disks including three different size particles ( 1 , 0.1 , and 0.03 mm ) and three different mass planets ( 1 , 3 , 6 m@xmath67 ) have been simulated , respectively .",
    "all the runs are summarized in tabel 1 and discussed in  4.3 .",
    "because the dust filtration process is mainly determined by the planet - induced gap structure which is quite axisymmetric except in the region close to the planet , it is useful to construct simpler azimuthally averaged 1-d models ; by comparing 1-d models with 2-d simulations , we can separate effects due to axisymmetric and non - axisymmetric features . for axisymmetric flows ,",
    "the dust surface density evolution is governed by the continuity equation ( takeuchi & lin 2005 ) @xmath70=0\\,,\\label{eq : sigd}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 is the dust mass flux due to diffusion , @xmath72 and @xmath73 is the dust radial velocity in the rest frame due to the gas - drag @xmath74 where @xmath75 , @xmath44 are defined above .",
    "when @xmath76 the above equation can be approximated by @xmath77 we can also incorporate the diffusion term in equation [ eq : sigd ] into the the dust velocity so that the equivalent total dust velocity is @xmath78 where the first term on the right hand side is the dust radial velocity induced by the gas radial velocity ( normally it is negative due to the accretion process ) , the second term is the dust drift velocity with respect to the gas due to the gas pressure gradient ( at the gap outer edge @xmath44 is negative ) , and the last term is the dust velocity due to dust diffusion .",
    "the addition of the first two terms is the dust drift velocity in the rest frame without diffusion .",
    "the only quantities which can not be calculated in the 1-d models are the gaseous disk surface density with a gap opened by a planet ( @xmath79 , which is needed to calculate @xmath44 ) and the gas radial velocity @xmath80 . here",
    ", we adopt the gaseous disk surface density ( @xmath79 ) from 2-d simulations , and the initial dust surface density is chosen as 1/100th of the gas surface density .",
    "we also assume the gas radial mass flux at each radius is a constant ( equal to @xmath3 ) , giving @xmath81 this implies the gas velocity can be quite large deep inside the gap where the gas surface density is very low .",
    "this high velocity has significant impact on the dust drift as discussed in rice et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and  4.3 . in 1-d",
    ", the radial velocity advection is ignored and the azimuthal velocity is assumed to be keplerian .",
    "thus we can simulate the pressureless fluid without worrying about shock formation .",
    "furthermore , in our set - up , @xmath80 and @xmath79 are fixed , so that @xmath73 is also fixed and the part of equation [ eq : sigd ] without diffusion is a linear equation for @xmath82 . due to the simplicity of the 1-d model , it not only extracts the essential physics but can also serve as a sanity check for 2-d simulations .",
    "before we present any results , we want to emphasize that equation [ eq : driftv3 ] guides all our discussions below .",
    "dust filtration happens when equation [ eq : driftv3 ] ( or equation [ eq : driftv2 ] if there is no dust diffusion ) becomes positive so that the total dust velocity is outwards . in the following ,",
    "we will first present the simplest case without dust diffusion and then we will present results with dust diffusion considered .      although a 1 m@xmath67 planet can only open a shallow gap in the gas disk in our set - up , 1 mm dust particles can be effectively trapped at the gap outer edge . as shown in the left panel of figure [ fig : fig1 ] , the gaseous gap is barely apparent and the depth of the gap is half of the unperturbed disk .",
    "however , if dust diffusion is ignored , such a shallow gaseous gap can effectively stop 1 mm particles at the gap outer edge due to the dust drift . then without replenishment , 1 mm dust particles in the inner disk quickly move inward to the central star , leaving a large mm dust cavity / hole in the disk ( the second to left panel of figure [ fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "the cavity is highly depleted by four orders of magnitude .",
    "thus the planetary wake is less apparent within the cavity , but it can still be seen outside the cavity .",
    "one feature which can be seen but is not very apparent in the dust image is the dust ring in the horseshoe region ( the ring can also be observed in figure [ fig : fig4 ] ) .",
    "the ring forms because the gas pressure has a local maximum in the center of the horseshoe region , effectively trapping dust particles .    on the other hand , smaller particles ( 0.1 mm , the second to right panel ) can still penetrate the planet - induced gap to the inner disk .",
    "this is because , without dust diffusion , the dust outward drift velocity with respect to the gas ( the second term in eq [ eq : driftv2 ] ) decreases as @xmath75 decreases and becomes comparable to the inward gas speed ( the first term in eq [ eq : driftv2 ] ) so that the total dust velocity can be inward towards the central star .",
    "since @xmath75 is proportional to the particle size , it means smaller particles may not have enough outward drift to counteract the global accretion speed and they will be carried inwards across the gap by the gas , although at a small speed .",
    "this small speed , which implies a low dust accretion rate , can lead to the particles piling up at the outer edge of the gap .",
    "thus the dust concentration is slightly increased at the outer edge of the gap , which makes the gap look deeper .",
    "but generally , the spatial structure of the small dust particles looks similar to that of the gaseous disk without a highly depleted cavity / hole .    for smaller particles ( eg .",
    "0.03 mm in the right - most panel of figure [ fig : fig1 ] ) , @xmath75 decreases , and the dust disk behaves more similarly to the gaseous disk . in the extreme limit that dust particles are very small so that the drift velocity is negligible compared with the accretion velocity , the structure of the dust disk looks exactly like that of the gaseous disk .      the dust filtration process can be significantly hindered by dust diffusion , as originally pointed out by ward ( 2009 ) .",
    "dust diffusion tries to smooth any density feature of the dust relative to the gas .",
    "thus , at the gap outer edge , dust tries to diffuse inwards , leading to an additional inward dust speed ( adding the third term in equation [ eq : driftv3 ] ) , which lowers the outward drift speed . the diffusion velocity ( eq [ eq : sigd ] ) is @xmath83 unlike the gas diffusion velocity @xmath84 which depends on the gas surface density",
    ", the dust diffusion velocity depends on the dust concentration relative to the gas rather than on its absolute abundance .    at the beginning of the simulation ,",
    "the abundances of dust and gas do not vary much so that the concentration of dust @xmath85 everywhere and dust diffusion can be ignored .",
    "however , as shown in the last section , the dust quickly concentrates at the gap outer edge and dust diffusion can play a significant role .",
    "the timescale for dust diffusion becoming important is the dust radial drift timescale , assuming the gaseous disk is in steady state , @xmath86 where r@xmath87 is the position of the planet - induced gap and @xmath73 is defined in equation [ eq : driftv ] . with our disk parameters ( @xmath3=10@xmath88 , @xmath0=0.01 , r@xmath87=20 au ) , @xmath89=9@xmath6810@xmath69 yr for 1 mm particles , 2@xmath6810@xmath90 yr ( the gas viscous timescale ) for 0.1 mm and smaller particles .",
    "thus , to study dust filtration , we have to evolve the disk long enough . for small dust particles ( @xmath910.1 mm ) , it means to simulate the disk evolution at the disk viscous timescale at the position of the gap ( @xmath72@xmath6810@xmath90yr ) . in this work",
    ", we managed to carry out such simulations by using the sft approximation .",
    "figure [ fig : fig2 ] shows that dust diffusion significantly hinders dust filtration .",
    "compared with the right panels of figure [ fig : fig1 ] , the dust gap is much shallower and the dust distribution is a lot smoother .",
    "1 mm dust particles can still penetrate the gap opened by a 1 m@xmath67 planet , unlike the case without diffusion .",
    "however , dust diffusion can not stop dust filtration indefinitely .",
    "if the gap is steeper ( e.g. a gap opened by a 3 m@xmath67 planet , the lower panels of figure [ fig : fig2 ] ) , 1 mm dust particles can still be filtered by the gap , which will be discussed below .",
    "figure [ fig : fig4 ] shows both gas and dust surface densitiy profiles for various planets in the disk ( 1 , 3 , 6 m@xmath67 from top to bottom ) with and without dust diffusion ( right and left panels , respectively ) .",
    "the solid curves are the gas surface densities divided by 100 . at the end of the simulation ,",
    "if the dust surface density is depleted by more than 1000 at the inner boundary ( @xmath923 orders of magnitude smaller than the solid curve ) , we say the dust is significantly depleted and filtered .",
    "the top panels show the disk surface densities with a 1 m@xmath67 planet at 20 au . as discussed above",
    ", the gaseous gap is quite shallow , approximately half of the unperturbed disk surface density . without dust diffusion ,",
    "such a shallow gap is capable of filtering 1 mm dust particles , but unable to filter smaller particles .",
    "however , with dust diffusion , all the dust particle sizes we considered ( @xmath93 mm ) can pass through this 1 m@xmath67 planet - induced gap .",
    "dust diffusion also changes the dust distribution in the outer disk : dust can diffuse outwards , slowing down the shrinkage of the dust disk and making the decline of the dust surface density with increasing radius more gradual .",
    "the middle panels show the disk surface densities with a 3 m@xmath67 planet at 20 au .",

    "the left panel shows the case without dust diffusion , while the right panel includes dust diffusion .",
    "the gas velocity is the green curve .",
    "the total dust velocity is the solid black curve , including the dust drift velocity in the rest frame ( the addition of the first and second terms of equation [ eq : driftv3 ] , dotted curve ) and the diffusion velocity ( the third term of equation [ eq : driftv3 ] , dashed curve ) . as shown in this figure , dust drift is fully capable of filtering the 1 mm particles ( the dust drift velocity in the rest frame is positive at the gap outer edge ) .",
    "however dust diffusion adds an additional negative velocity component .",
    "the net effect is that the total dust velocity is still inwards ( dust filtration fails ) when dust diffusion is considered .    in summary ,",
    "dust diffusion hinders the dust filtration process .",
    "1 mm - sized particles will be filtered by a gap one order of magnitude deep and particles with sizes @xmath94 mm will be filtered by a gap that is two orders of magnitude deep .",
    "another effect hindering filtration is the high gas velocity at the gap edge .",
    "although this effect is self - consistently treated in simulations , it needs special attention in analytical approaches as noted in rice et al .",
    "we have identified and verified this effect in our simulations .",
    "considering the gas accretion rate is constant across the planet - induced gap ( if we allow the planet to accrete , this is still true at the outer edge of the gap ) , the radial velocity has to increase in the gap since the disk surface density decreases in the gap ( according to @xmath95 ) . with a two orders of magnitude deep gaseous gap , the gas velocity can be amplified by two orders of magnitude within the gap .",
    "thus the first term of equation [ eq : driftv3 ] is significantly increased .",
    "please note that this argument is built on the assumption that the velocity is axisymmetric inside the planet - induced gap .",
    "although this assumption is incorrect deep inside the gap around the horseshoe orbits ( see appendix ) , the flow is quite axisymmetric at the edge of the gap where dust filtration takes place .",
    "we have checked 2-d simulations directly and confirmed that the radial velocity increases by a factor that is close to the gaseous gap depletion factor .",
    "this effect becomes increasingly important for a deeper gaseous gap .    to illustrate this effect",
    ", we again use the simplest 1-d model to show various components of the dust velocity , as shown in figure [ fig : fig6 ] .",
    "even with dust diffusion considered , by ignoring the amplification of the gas radial velocity across the gap ( green curve in the left panel is flat ) , 0.03 mm particles will be filtered in the 6 m@xmath67 gap .",
    "however , considering the gas velocity is amplified ( the right panel ) , 0.03 mm particles can pass through the gap , consistent with the results from 2-d simulations .",
    "although our simulations have suggested that 1 mm particles will be filtered by a gap one order of magnitude deep and @xmath960.1 mm particles will be filtered by a gap that is two orders of magnitude deep , it would be insightful to have a simple analytic model to show how the critical filtration particle size depends on the disk parameters .",
    "both dust diffusion and high gas velocity at the gap edge are important as pointed out above .",
    "thus we will consider them separately and then combine their effects .",
    "first , we will assume the radial gas flow velocity is zero , and only consider the dust diffusion process to balance the dust drift .",
    "we are trying to find the marginal state between the dust being filtered and drifting inwards .",
    "this marginal state can be derived by assuming the diffusion velocity equation [ eq : vdif ] balances the drift velocity @xmath97 since @xmath981 , and plugging in @xmath99 and @xmath100 , we derive @xmath101 here we have assumed the sound speed varies slowly compared with @xmath79 so that it can be treated as a constant , which is a good approximation at the gap edges .    in order to proceed ,",
    "we need to assign a planet - induced gap shape @xmath79 , which can be derived by balancing the planetary torque density and the gradient of the viscous torque ( ward 2009 ) @xmath102 where @xmath103 , and @xmath104 . assuming @xmath105 , @xmath23 , and @xmath35 are constant ( which is a good approximation in the gap region compared with the factor @xmath106 ) , this equation can be integrated to obtain the gap profile @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the ambient unperturbed disk surface density .",
    ", we have overestimated the torque density so that our gap shape is sharper than a real gap . ]    plugging equation [ eq : gapsig ] into equation [ eq : filtra ] and noticing that @xmath109 , we obtain @xmath110 note that @xmath75 is also a function of @xmath79 , suggesting that dust and gas are more decoupled within the gap . integrating this equation with respect to @xmath111 , and assigning @xmath112 , we derive @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the dust to gas mass ratio , @xmath115 , at position @xmath111 within the gap .",
    "then , @xmath116 can be translated back to @xmath117 with equation [ eq : gapsig ] , giving @xmath118    the relationship between the dust depletion factor in the gap ( @xmath119 , the depletion of the dust / gas mass ratio inside the gap compared with that outside the gap ) and the gaseous gap depth ( @xmath120 ) is shown in figure [ fig : fig8 ] with the assumption that @xmath0=0.01 and @xmath1 . as in  4.3.2 ,",
    "if the dust depletion factor is smaller than 0.001 , then we consider that the particles are filtered efficiently . from the hydrodynamic simulations , we know the gaseous gap opened by a planet that is a few times more massive than jupiter is on the order of 0.01 of the unperturbed disk surface density ( this is clearly shown in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : fig4 ] where the gaseous gap opened by a 6 @xmath121 planet is 2 orders of magnitude deep . ) .",
    "thus , figure [ fig : fig8 ] shows particles smaller than @xmath122 will penetrate through such a planet - induced gap and not be filtered .",
    "we note that , with a given gap depth and structure , the dust depletion within the gap only depends on one dimensionless parameter @xmath123 .",
    "since @xmath112 , this parameter is @xmath124 . considering that the quantity @xmath125 is proportional to the disk mass accretion rate ( @xmath3 ) , @xmath123 depends only on the particle size over the disk accretion rate ( @xmath126 ) .",
    "the curve labeled with 10 @xmath127 in our figure [ fig : fig8 ] assuming @xmath1 can also represent 100 @xmath127 particles in a @xmath128 disk or 1 @xmath127 particles in a @xmath129 disk .",
    "thus if the disk accretion rate is very low , smaller dust can be filtered .",
    "the reason can be directly seen from equation [ eq : nueta ] . with the same @xmath79 and @xmath75 ,",
    "smaller @xmath0 means less dust diffusion so that the critical particle size for which diffusion balances outward drift decreases .",
    "one caution is that the gap density ( equation [ eq : gapsig ] ) diverges to infinity when @xmath130 and in reality the gap density profile truncate at some radius @xmath111 .",
    "here we rely on numerical simulations to determine where the gap truncates and the depth of the gap ( @xmath119 ) .",
    "now we consider the second effect : amplified gas radial velocity at the gap edge .",
    "the particle drift velocity due to the pressure gradient ( the second term of equation [ eq : driftv3 ] ) not only needs to be larger than the diffusion velocity as above , but also needs to counter the gas radial velocity ( @xmath80 ) within the gap . here",
    "we compare the dust radial drift velocity derived above with the gas radial velocity from the gas accretion .",
    "the dust drift velocity ( the right side of equation [ eq : nueta ] ) at the gap outer edge ( equation [ eq : gapsig ] ) is @xmath131 considering the gas flow velocity @xmath80 outside the gap gives @xmath132 , and the gas velocity is amplified by @xmath133 at the gap edge to maintain a constant accretion rate , we derive @xmath134 again we can relate @xmath135 with the gaseous gap depth @xmath120 from equation [ eq : gapsig ] and obtain @xmath136^{4/3}\\frac{1}{w}\\,.\\ ] ] this is plotted in figure [ fig : fig7 ] .",
    "when @xmath137 is smaller than 1 , dust can pass through the gap with the gas due to the amplified gas velocity .",
    "thus with a gap that is two orders of magnitude deep , 10 @xmath127 particles can pass through the gap with the gas .",
    "again the dimensionless parameter @xmath123 is present in this analysis . here",
    "lower @xmath0 means lower radial velocity and easier particle filtering .",
    "but besides that , another dimensionless parameter @xmath138 is also present , and @xmath138 depends on @xmath0 , @xmath139 , and @xmath105 . at smaller",
    "radii , dust is easier to filter since the outward drift velocity is larger . for the fixed radii ,",
    "the dependence of @xmath138 on @xmath0 is rather weak .",
    "when @xmath140 , more dust particles can penetrate the gap than that estimated by equation [ eq : gamma ] which just considers dust diffusion .",
    "thus , when the amplified gas velocity is important , fig [ fig : fig8 ] only shows the lower limit of the depletion factor ( marked as the thin curves ) . on the other hand when the the dust diffusion dominates , fig [ fig : fig8 ] shows the exact value of the dust depletion factor ( marked as the thick curves ) .",
    "overall , for a planet ( several m@xmath67 ) present at 20 au in a disk with @xmath0=0.01 and @xmath1 , the gap outer edge can filter particles larger than 0.1 mm , but particles smaller than 0.1 mm can pass through the planet - induced gap freely . if @xmath3 can be lowered to @xmath141 , this critical size can decrease to @xmath7 0.01 mm .",
    "paardekooper & mellema ( 2006 ) have carried out two fluid simulations similar to our approach but using a conservative godunov scheme to study the response of mm sized dust to the planet .",
    "they focus on the minimum planet mass to open a gap in the dust disk and find a 0.05 m@xmath67 planet can open a gap in the mm - sized dust component . a similar result was also found using three dimensional sph simulations by fouchet et al.(2007 ) .",
    "this can be partly understood as the thermal mass ( @xmath142 ) of a dust disk is significantly lower than that of the gaseous disk since the dust is a pressureless system , so that a gap is easier to be opened in the dust disk .",
    "dust diffusion is ignored in both of these studies .",
    "however if the relative density between the dust and gas has a large gradient across the gap or spiral wakes , dust diffusion may play an important role to smear out any feature in the dust disk .",
    "our work focuses on gap opening by more massive planets to study the effect of the gaseous gap edge on much smaller grains ( @xmath143 m ) which are essential for near - ir deficit of transitional disk systems .",
    "this dust filtration process by the planet - induced gaseous gap outer edge was first studied by rice et al .",
    "( 2006 ) with an analytical approach and they concluded micron sized particles can be filtered by the planet - induced gap . in detail",
    "they suggested that a gap opened by a 5 m@xmath67 planet might be able to filter 1 @xmath139 m particles and above .",
    "dust diffusion due to disk turbulence is ignored in their calculations . beyond the analytical approach ,",
    "numerical simulations are difficult to carry out to study dust filtration since small particles have very short stopping time which limits the numerical time step . in this work we use the sft approximation which allows us to study this problem using numerical simulations .",
    "we have found that the critical size for dust filtration is larger than that estimated by rice et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . in our simulations ,",
    "the gap outer edge near a 6 m@xmath67 planet can only filter 100@xmath139 m particles and above .",
    "the difference partly comes from a lower accretion rate in their models ( the discussion of the critical particle size on disk accretion rate is in  4.4 ) .",
    "but more importantly , the difference is due to dust diffusion from disk turbulence ( ward 2009 ) .    the larger critical particle size for filtration poses challenges to explain transitional disks with dust filtration alone , as discussed in  6 .      without considering dust feedback and dust diffusion ,",
    "the dust velocity is fully determined by the gas surface density ( equation [ eq : driftv ] ) .",
    "thus , due to the lack of feedback between the dust concentration and its velocity , the dust disk can not achieve a steady state .",
    "dust will continue to pile up at the outer edge of the gap ( e.g. the upper left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] ) , and eventually dust feedback on the gas through drag forces becomes important there , as pointed out by ward ( 2009 ) .",
    "however , with dust diffusion considered , the dust concentration can affect the dust velocity ( equation [ eq : driftv2 ] ) , and a steady state can be reached on the dust drift timescale .",
    "this leads to a smoother and lower dust surface density ( e.g. the upper right panel of fig . [",
    "fig : fig4 ] ) , which weakens the dust feedback .",
    "furthermore , with smaller and smaller particles , dust diffusion is much more important than the dust drift velocity so that the dust surface density is smoothed even more",
    ".    the dust disk steady state can be calculated by assuming the product of the dust velocity and density is a constant .",
    "at the outer disk and for 1 mm particles , dust drift and diffusion velocities are far larger than the gas velocity .",
    "thus we can seek a solution for which the last two terms of equation [ eq : driftv3 ] balance each other .",
    "it can be easily derived that a gaseous disk surface density varying as @xmath144 requires the dust surface density to vary as @xmath145 if outward diffusion balances inward drift . if @xmath146=1 , @xmath147 , which is consistent with our simulations with dust diffusion at the outer disk ( the left panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] ) .",
    "this property has important implications for submm observations in protoplanetary disks .",
    "it suggests the dust disk will not shrink indefinitely if there is dust diffusion and we can use the dust surface density structure to imply the gas surface density structure .",
    "since our simulations have determined the critical dust size due to gap edge filtration , we can estimate the fraction of dust mass being filtered by the gap in a protoplanetary disk .",
    "the exact mass fraction of dust larger than some size depends on the dust size distribution function @xmath148 , where @xmath149 is the dust size .",
    "dust in the diffuse interstellar medium is thought to have a size distribution @xmath150 from 0.005 to 1@xmath139 m ( mathis , rumpl & nordsieck 1977 ) . in protoplanetary disks ,",
    "the size distribution function can be flatter , possibly due to dust growth , with @xmath151 ( dalessio et al .",
    "the total dust mass fraction for particles smaller than @xmath152 is @xmath153 where @xmath154 and @xmath155 are the maximum and minimum sizes of the dust with distribution @xmath156 .",
    "if both @xmath154 and @xmath152 are far larger than @xmath155 , this reduces to @xmath157 .",
    "our simulations above suggest only dust equal or larger than 0.01@xmath1580.1 mm can be filtered . thus if we adopt @xmath159 mm ( dalessio et al .",
    "2001 ) , the dust smaller than 0.1 mm only accounts for 10@xmath48 of the total dust mass with @xmath160 or 1@xmath48 of the total dust mass with @xmath161 , and dust smaller than 0.01 mm only accounts for 1@xmath48 of the total dust mass with @xmath160 .",
    "thus the dust mass fraction is decreased significantly when dust crosses the planet - induced gap . with only 1@xmath48 dust mass passing through the gap , the dust to gas ratio within",
    "the gap decreases to 10@xmath162 .",
    "however , since all the micron - sized dust grains can pass through the gap freely , the near - ir sed of the disk is hardly affected by the filtration process , which will be emphasized in  6 .",
    "as summarized in the introduction , ( pre-)transitional disks have wide and deep gaps , and a moderate gas accretion rate onto the star .",
    "gap opening by planet(s ) is an intriguing possibility . to produce these wide and deep gaps with planets ,",
    "two main scenarios have been proposed : gap opening by multiple planets ( e.g. zhu et al .",
    "2011 , dodson - robinson & salyk 2011 ) and dust filtration ( rice et al .",
    "2006 ) .    since both gap opening by multiple planets ( zhu et al .",
    "2011 ) and dust filtration ( this work ) hardly affect the micron sized particle distribution within au scales , the near - ir seds of these disks should look similar to those of classical t - tauri disks .",
    "thus both scenarios can explain pre - transitional disk near - ir seds , especially for those having the same sed as classical t - tauri disks ( andrews et al .",
    "however , both of the scenarios have difficulties in reproducing transitional disk seds which have strong near - ir deficits .    in the following",
    "we will use a monte - carlo radiative transfer model to demonstrate this difficulty with both 1 ) gap opening by multiple planets , 2 ) dust filtration , and provide one possible solution with 3 ) filtration+grain growth to reproduce the transitional disk gm aur s sed .",
    "the monte carlo radiative transfer code was developed by whitney et al .",
    "( 2003a , b ) , robitaille et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , and whitney et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , while for the disk structure see whitney et al .",
    "( 2003b ) for references .",
    "this entire disk is composed of two dust components : a thick disk with small ( i.e. , ism - like @xmath139m - sized ) grains , and a thin disk with large ( mm - sized ) grains .",
    "we use the standard ism dust model for the small - dust ( kim et al .",
    "1994 ) , and use model 3 in wood et al .",
    "( 2002 ) for the large - dust ( @xmath146=3 with the maximum particle size 1 mm ) .",
    "both disk components are isothermal in the vertical direction , and their respective scale heights @xmath163 and @xmath164 obey a simple power law @xmath165 , with @xmath163 fixed to be @xmath166 .",
    "the disk extends from the sublimation radius ( self - consistently determined by the dust sublimation temperature ) to 200au .    to reproduce a classical t tauri disk sed for comparison",
    ", we set - up a full disk model , where the gas surface density profile is @xmath167 and @xmath168 is the scaling length fixed to be 100 au .",
    "this is the same as our hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "dust mass is 1@xmath48 of the disk mass . among all the dust",
    ", 1@xmath48 is in the small - dust , while the rest is in the large - dust , which is equivalent to saying that the small - dust depletion and settling factor is 0.01 .",
    "this choice is based on both our argument in  5.3 ( if the dust distribution function is @xmath169 from submicron sizes to 1 mm , 99@xmath48 of the dust will be in the grains larger than 0.01 mm ) , and observational constraints ( furlan et al .  2006 ) .",
    "note that this implies dust has already grown to mm sizes in the outer disk and the small - dust is only 1@xmath48 of the total dust mass .",
    "the full disk model has a total mass of 0.1 m@xmath170 , and a scale height profile with @xmath171 at 100 au and @xmath172=1.2 .",
    "the accretion rate is assumed to be 10@xmath173 .",
    "these are nominal values for a classical t tauri disk , and they are consistent with our hydrodynamical simulations . since we are trying to fit the sed of gm aur , the central source is assumed to be a 5730 k pre - main star with radius 1.5 r@xmath174 and mass 1.2 m@xmath170 ( calvet et al .",
    "2005 ) and the inclination angle of this system is 55 degrees .    the full disk s sed is shown as the dotted curves in the bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig9 ] .",
    "it produces a strong near - ir flux , similar to a classical t tauri disk sed . in the following",
    "we will modify this full disk model based on results from hydrodynamic simulations trying to reproduce transitional disk gm aur s sed ( the red curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig9 ] ) .      to simulate gap opening by multiple planets",
    ", we cut a wide gap in the disk for both small and large dust ( the left panel of figure [ fig : fig9 ] ) . in zhu et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , with the same disk structure , using hydrodynamic simulations , we found that four giant planets can open a gap from 2 to 20 au with the gap depth 1/1000 th of the unperturbed disk surface density .",
    "thus here we cut the gap from 2 to 25 au and both small and large dust surface density is decreased by a factor of 1000 compared with the unperturbed disk .",
    "the gap is clearly seen in the dust surface density contours in the left panels of figure [ fig : fig9 ]",
    ". however , the near - ir sed from the modeled disk with 4 planets produces an sed more similar to that of classical t tauri disks , rather than transitional disks ( the left bottom panel ) .",
    "this is because the inner disk within 2 au is the same as a full disk .",
    "this similar sed as that of a full disk is not surprising , since previous work has already suggested the near - ir deficit of transitional disk requires small - dust in the inner disk , on scales less than 1 au , to be depleted by many orders of magnitude ( espaillat et al .  2010 , zhu et al .",
    "2011 ) . to be more specific , considering those transitional disks having accretion rates @xmath175 onto the star , and using @xmath176 we know",
    "@xmath79 is @xmath177 at 0.1 au for @xmath178 .",
    "considering that the nominal opacity of ism dust at 10 @xmath127 is 10 @xmath179 , the optical depth at 0.1 au is 10@xmath180 . but sed modeling of transitional disks ( e.g. gm aur ) require the disk to be optically thin at 0.1 au ( calvet et al .",
    "2005 ) ; thus the micron - sized dust , which contributes most to the near - ir flux , needs to be depleted at least by three orders of magnitude . however , gap opening by multiple planets from 2 - 20 au has little effect on the dust distribution within au scales and thus it wo nt prevent the near - ir sed from being similar to a full disk model .      to simulate the effect of dust filtration , large - dust is absent within 25 au compared with the full disk model ( the middle panel of figure [ fig : fig9 ] ) .",
    "all large - dust is assumed to be filtered .",
    "however the small - dust can pass the planet - induced gap and has the same distribution as a full disk ( middle panels of figure [ fig : fig9 ] ) .",
    "again , although the mid - ir sed changes a little bit due to the depletion of the large - dust , the optical to near - ir sed looks similar to the full disk ( the middle bottom panel ) since small - dust dominates the optical to near - ir opacity .",
    "this demonstrates that although dust filtration is efficient at reducing the total dust mass , since most of the dust mass resides in large dust particles (  5.3 ) , it has little effect on the near - ir sed due to the fact that near - ir sed is determined by the micron - sized particles which can not be filtered by the gap .",
    "although dodson - robinson & salyk ( 2011 ) speculated that dust can be trapped in the spiral wakes , trapping in spiral wakes is only a second order effect compared with the gap filtration , since the density wakes have far smoother density profiles than the gap edge .",
    "if the gap edge fails to trap micron sized particles , the density wakes wo nt be able to trap these particles .",
    "our two fluid simulations ( figure [ fig : fig2 ] and [ fig : fig3 ] ) also do not show dust pile up in the density wakes .",
    "however , under some extreme circumstances ( e.g. @xmath181 , the presence of a 10 m@xmath67 planet ) , the critical filtration size may decrease to 10@xmath182 . with a flat dust size distribution ( e.g. @xmath146=2 in  5.3 ) ,",
    "dust smaller than 10 @xmath182 could have a mass less than @xmath183 of the total dust mass .",
    "thus , after filtration , small - dust could have a depletion factor equal to @xmath183 , which is close to the small - dust depletion factor ( @xmath184 ) required to explain the near - ir deficit of gm aur . )",
    "the dust depletion factor can be @xmath185 for the disk to be optically thin ( salyk et al .",
    "2007 ) . in this case , a large disk viscosity parameter @xmath0 is required to explain the observed gas accretion rates . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig10 ] , we have calculated two cases with a small(@xmath186m)/large(@xmath187 m ) dust mass ratio @xmath7 10@xmath188 at the outer disk and only small - dust existing in the inner disk .",
    "as expected , in this case , the near - ir deficit can be reproduced due to the tiny amount of small - dust in the disk .",
    "however , this tiny amount of small dust makes not only the inner disk optically thin but also the outer disk s atmosphere optically thin ( assuming large dust grains have settled to the midplane forming a dust layer whose thickness is only 20@xmath48 of the gas disk ) .",
    "the mid - ir flux is very weak too and unable to reproduce the irs observations ( dotted curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig10 ] ) . in order to reproduce the mid - ir flux ,",
    "the large dust grains have to remain suspended in the atmosphere of the disk and not settle ( maintaining the same thickness as the gaseous disk ) to intercept the stellar radiation , which is shown by the dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig10 ] ) .",
    "the dashed curve in fig . [ fig : fig10 ] suggests that it is not impossible for dust filtration alone to explain gm aur .",
    "but several conditions have to be met : 1 ) dust grows significantly in the outer disk ( flat dust size distribution , and the small - dust ( @xmath18910@xmath139 m ) to big - dust mass ratio is 10@xmath188 ) ; 2 ) a very massive planet forms in a disk with a low accretion rate ; 3 ) large grains in the outer disk can not settle .",
    "these conditions are not easy to satisfy since a normal t tauri disk has a small - dust depletion factor of 0.1 - 0.001 , and large grains are settled to the midplane .",
    "furthermore gm aur has a disk mass accretion rate @xmath190 .      as implied above , to reproduce the near - ir deficit of transitional disk seds it is essential to reduce the small - dust ( @xmath910.01 mm ) abundance in the inner disk within au scales .",
    "one solution is considering the growth of small dust particles after large particles are filtered by the planet - induced gap .",
    "dust can grow quite rapidly in the inner disk .",
    "it may only take 10@xmath180 yrs for dust particles to grow from sub - micron sizes to 1000 @xmath139 m at 1 au ( e.g. models s3 and s4 in dullemond & dominik 2005 ) .",
    "one way to stop the rapid dust growth is by collisional fragmentation ( dullemond & dominik 2005 , dominik & dullemond 2008 ) , in which case large particles are shattered to replenish small dust grains .",
    "thus , the growth and fragmentation maintains a quasi - stationary dust size distribution function . in disks with gaps ,",
    "if all big grains ( @xmath191 m ) are filtered acrossing the gap ( accounting for 99@xmath48 of the total dust mass if we assume the critical filtration size is 0.1 mm with @xmath161 or the critical size is 0.01 mm with @xmath160 , as estimated in  5.3 ) , the remaining small grains ( accounting for 1@xmath48 total dust mass ) that manage to pass through to the inner disk can grow quite efficiently without replenishment from fragmentation of large particles . although the dust growth time is 100 times longer than the timescale for a non - filtered disk ( the dust growth time is inversely proportional to the dust abundance ) , it is still modestly shorter than the at 20 au with @xmath0=0.01",
    ". eventually a new balance is made , and the quasi - stationary dust size distribution is established again . at this time , due to grain growth , the small - dust is only @xmath192 of the abundance that was present after it had passed through the planet s orbit location . in other words ,",
    "small - dust is depleted indirectly due to dust growth and the net depletion factor for small particles in the inner disk is 10@xmath162(@xmath192 after filtration @xmath193 mass fraction in the new size distribution ) .",
    "such a scenario of `` double depletion '' may explain transitional disks , but requires further study to place it on a firmer foundation .    to simulate this scenario",
    "we assume small - dust grows in the inner disk and reestablish the dust size distribution after large particles are filtered by the planet - induced gap at 25 au .",
    "this is illustrated in the right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig9 ] . in the inner disk",
    "we assume the new dust size distribution has a small to large dust mass ratio 1:999 .",
    "since the total dust mass is decreased to 1@xmath48 after dust filtration and this new distribution further reduces the small - dust by a factor of 1000 , the small - dust is depleted by a factor of 10@xmath90 , and the mass ratio of small - dust to gas is @xmath194 .",
    "this leads to an optically thin inner disk .",
    "the disk s sed fits the gm aur sed quite well in the bottom right panel .",
    "note that in this scenario small particle growth is a gradual process . although we deplete the dust in the inner disk uniformly for computational convenience ( upper two panels in the right column of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig9 ] , or in other words we assume small particles grow instantaneously after they cross the gap ) ; in reality the abundance for small particles may change gradually and join the outer disk abundance smoothly .    the readers may notice 10 @xmath139 m silicate feature is not fitted well by our simple models .",
    "but we want to point out that the strength of the silicate emission depends not only upon the total amount of dust inside the gap , but upon dust size distribution , especially for small dust ( @xmath18910@xmath139 m ) .",
    "the dust size distribution sensitively depends on growth , fragmentation , and differential drift of particles of differing size .",
    "predicting the strength of the silicate emission feature will require addressing the very complex processes involved in grain evolution in concert with calculations of drift similar to those in the present paper .",
    "for example , when small dust particles grow to big particles , big particles will quickly drift to the central star , and if the drift timescale is much shorter than the dust growth timescale , only small particles will exist in the inner disk .",
    "a careful dust evolutionary model combined with dust filtration is important to test this scenario .",
    "nevertheless , small - dust needs ( @xmath18910@xmath139 m ) to be depleted more than that dust filtration predicts to explain near - ir deficit of transitional disks .    in this work",
    "we only put one planet in the disk to study dust filtration , because the dust filtration process does not sensitively depends on the number of the planets in the disk since most dust will be filtered by the outermost planet gap or the deepest gap .",
    "thus most our results can also be applied to the gap opened by multiple planets in the disk , which is complimentary to zhu et al .",
    "we note , however , that a multiple planet system may need to be invoked to dynamically clear planetesimals from the inner disk region as the presence of such bodies is likely to provide a source for small dust grains through their mutual collisions .",
    "dust filtration has other observational implications besides seds .",
    "dust filtration by the planet - induced gap differentiates various particles . thus if we observe transitional disks at various wavelengths the gap / cavity should be more distinctive at longer wavelengths ( fouchet et al .",
    "2010 and our figs .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] to [ fig : fig4 ] ) .",
    "dust growth as argued above wo nt happen instantaneously as the flow passes through the planet - induced gap .",
    "thus at shorter wavelengths , the cavity which is found by submm observations is less apparent or even disappears ( e.g. fig .",
    "1 ) . andrews et al .  (",
    "2011 ) notice that there are ( pre-)transitional disks with classical t - tauri disk seds but that show gaps in submm interferometry .",
    "more directly , recent subaru observations have found a lot of ( pre-)transitional disks that have submm cavities ( andrews et al .",
    "2011 ) do not show cavities in near - ir scattered light images ( dong et al .",
    "2012 ) . both of these findings seem to agree with the dust filtration scenario .",
    "however , after the big grains are filtered , whether and how much small grains can grow is a difficult issue ; it requires a dust evolutionary model combined with dust dynamics .",
    "the complexity of the problem is illustrated by , for example , birnstiel et al .",
    "( 2011 ) and references therein . in this work , based on transitional disk seds",
    ", we suggest that small - dust needs to grow in the inner disk .",
    "figure [ fig : fig12 ] shows both big - dust ( larger than the critical filtration size ) surface density and the 850 @xmath139 m opacity in the filtration+grain growth scenario accretion disk . ] . both the large - grain surface density and the submm opacity change at the gap edge due to dust filtration .",
    "the submm opacity decreases by a factor @xmath195100 at the gap edge , which is consistent with submm constraints from andrews et al .",
    "( 2011 ) . in the near future",
    ", alma can determine how sharp the opacity decreases in greater detail , which is important to distinguish a pure grain growth scenario (  6.6 ) and scenarios involving a gaseous gap .",
    "more generally , alma can test all the three scenarios above . for gap opening by multiple planets without dust filtration ,",
    "both gas ( probed by molecular lines ) and dust ( probed by dust continuum ) inside the gap should be equally depleted .",
    "furthermore , in this scenario , the sharpness of the outer gap edge and inner gap edge should look similar due to the symmetric nature of the gaseous gap shape .",
    "if dust filtration is at work , the mm sized dust will be more depleted inside the gap than the gas , and the inner gap edge in submm images should be smoother , or even disappear , than the outer gap edge ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] ) .",
    "to test whether there is grain growth inside the gap , we can use multiple wavelength observations to see how the slope of the opacity changes . however , the dust radial drift may change the big - dust distributions in the inner disk .",
    "alma can also test if the dust and gas have similar density profiles at the outer disk beyond the gap .",
    "our simulations suggest that , combining dust drift and diffusion , the dust and gas surface density profiles in the outer disk can be quite different (  5.4 ) . although submm observations ( andrews et al .",
    "2012 ) have indeed suggested that the dust disk is more compact than the gaseous disk , the different surface density slopes between the dust and gas disks predicted in  5.4 need to be tested by future alma observations .",
    "but we note that dust growth and fragmentation can potentially change this relationship ( e.g. birnstiel et al .",
    "2012 ) .      as illustrated above , the key ingredient to reproduce the gm aur sed is reducing the abundance of micron sized dust particles by five orders of magnitude in the inner disk while maintaining a sufficient gas accretion .",
    "due to the good coupling between micron sized particles and the gas , any theory only considering gap formation in a gaseous disk is not enough , such as photoevaporation , gap opening by planets , etc .",
    "dust growth and settling have to be considered .",
    "besides filtration combined with dust growth , there are several other possibilities :    the first alternative is purely dust growth .",
    "if dust can grow significantly in the inner disk to make the inner disk optically thin , it can explain gm aur s sed .",
    "in this scenario it may suggest transitional disks are older than ctts , which has not been suggested by observations .",
    "furthermore , both sed fitting and sub - mm observations suggest the gap edge is very sharp , inconsistent with the pure dust growth model . however , with carma , isella et al.(2012 ) have suggested lkca 15 can be explained by the pure dust growth model .",
    "thus , pure dust growth could still be a possible solution .",
    "the second alternative is a large gas mass reservoir close to the central star with a wide and deep gap beyond .",
    "the wide and deep gap can be caused by a very massive planet(or even a star ) or several planets so there is no accretion flow from the outer disk to the inner disk .",
    "the accretion onto the star is sustained by the mass reservoir close to the planet ( e.g. a dead zone ) .",
    "however this mass reservoir needs to be very narrow or depleted in small - dust to not produce too much near - ir flux .",
    "the third alternative is the dust being held back by the radiation pressure ( chiang & murray - clay 2007 ) .",
    "however , the efficiency of the radiation pressure is questioned by dominik & dullemond ( 2011 ) .",
    "the fourth alternative is planet gap opening in layered disks .",
    "the pros and cons of this model will be discussed in a forthcoming paper .    however , there is one challenge to all the scenarios trying to explain transitional disks with gap opening by planet(s ) located at a few tens of au from the central star . in the core - accretion scenario ,",
    "the solid component in the inner disk is likely to have undergone significant growth to form planetesimals and planetary embryos within the time taken to form the putative planet at @xmath196 au .",
    "these planetesimals should collide and continuously regenerate small dust grains . as we have alluded to earlier in this paper , one way round",
    "this problem is to invoke the presence of multiple planets in the inner disk to clear these planetesimals . but",
    "this hypothesis clearly requires further investigation .",
    "dust filtration also suggests more massive planets can lead to stronger dust filtration and depletion .",
    "thus transitional disks may have higher mass planet(s ) than pre - transitional disks have .",
    "since a higher mass planet exerts a stronger torque on the outer disk , it may slow down the accretion flow passing the planet and lead to a lower disk accretion rate onto the star .",
    "this is consistent with observations that transitional disks have lower accretion rates than pre - transitional disks ( espaillat et al .",
    "2012 ) .    regarding dust growth , transitional disks put strict constraints on the dust abundance in the inner disk since the dust is optically thin .",
    "if these systems have moderate @xmath3 , we know they have a significant amount of gas and thus dust to gas ratio needs to be depleted . on the other hand , for transitional disks having little @xmath3",
    ", the disk may harbor a massive companion ( e.g. brown dwarf ) . in this case",
    ", both gas and dust components of the inner disk are significantly reduced below the detection limit and we know little about their dust to gas ratio , and thus dust growth / depletion is not necessary .    for pre - transitional disks ,",
    "the dust abundance in the inner disk is difficult to constrain since it is optically thick .",
    "thus it s possible to explain pre - transitional disks without invoking dust growth ( e.g. dust filtration , multiple - planets , photoevaporation alexander & armitage 2007 ) .",
    "however it s also possible that the planet(s ) in pre - transitional disk is / are less massive ( making the gap less sharp ) so that more dust passes through the planet - induced gap and the inner disk remains optically thick even with dust growth .",
    "in this paper , we have used two - dimensional two - fluid simulations , a one dimensional model , and analytic arguments to study dust filtration by the tidally - induced gap outer edge .",
    "we have found that dust diffusion and the high gas velocity at the gap edge significantly lower the dust filtration efficiency .",
    "only particles equal or larger than 0.1 mm can be filtered by a planet - induced gap if the disk has @xmath0=0.01 , @xmath1 and the planet mass is a few jupiter masses .",
    "these results can be partly scaled to disks having different mass accretion rates with one dimensionless parameter @xmath2 . with better understanding of the disk and gap structure",
    ", we may be able to constrain the planet mass with future multi - wavelength observations ( optical / near - ir scattered images , alma etc . ) .",
    "we have applied this dust filtration threshold ( 0.1 mm ) to transitional disks , and by using a monte - carlo radiative transfer model we have shown that dust filtration alone has difficulties in explaining transitional disk observations , especially for systems with moderate @xmath3 ( e.g. gm aur ) .",
    "the same difficulty is suffered by the multiple planets scenario .",
    "one possible solution is combining dust filtration with dust growth in the inner disk , although we have also discussed other possibilities .",
    "we conclude that dust filtration is a natural consequence of gap opening in protoplanetary disks , and although it has some difficulties to explain the near - ir deficit of some transitional disks ( which may require additional processes such as dust growth ) , it has important implications for future observations .",

    "the assumption of the sft approximation will be better suited and we would expect the results to be closer to the two - fluid simulations .    the even simpler 1-d models ( the long dashed curves ) did a fairly good job at both the inner and outer disk beyond the gap region .",

    "<S> we conclude that dust filtration with planet(s ) in the disk is a promising mechanism to explain submm observations of transitional disks but it may need to be combined with other processes ( e.g. dust growth ) to explain the near - ir deficit of some systems . </S>"
