    "more than 20 years ago , s.a .",
    "shakir @xcite presented a recursive method to find bound eigenvalues of the se .",
    "it was a relatively simple method , closely related to those used in the field of optics for calculating the fresnel amplitudes . in despite of its simplicity , and even of the fact of have been rediscovered a few years latter,@xcite this method has passed unnoted from the applied research fields until very recently.@xcite    in this work , instead of concerning with mathematical methods to solve the se for bound and scattering states , we are concerned with alternative methods capable of providing better physical insight about the quantum world . in other words , methods that provide solutions of the se without having to solve it mathematically .",
    "one class of alternative methods , which we call physical methods , is possible in one - dimension .",
    "they are based on the elemental action of a given stationary force field on the particle s wave function .",

    "in other words , when representing the potential by a discretized function , a finite value has to be assigned to the singularity .",
