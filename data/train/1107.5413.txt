    "even though the theory of measurements provides an integral part of quantum theory and even though to this day it has passed any close scrutiny the measurement process remains a topic of controversial discussions . according to von neumann @xcite the measurement of an observable yields one of the eigenvalues of the hermetian operator representing the measured observable and projects the state of the system onto the eigenspace of the resulting eigenvalue .",
    "there exist several attempts to explain this state reduction as resulting from the interaction of the system with a measurement apparatus whereby the system combined with the environment undergoes a unitary time evolution . depending on the special structure of the measurement apparatus and its coupling to the system the reduced system state undergoes decoherence  @xcite with respect to the eigen - basis of the operator to be measured . at the same time the state of the measurement apparatus adopts a particular `` pointer state '' .",
    "the latter process , also known as `` einselection '' , makes it possible to read out the result of the measurement  @xcite .    as for other physical processes",
    ", any measurement resulting from an interaction of the system with the measurement apparatus will take a finite amount of time .",
    "this aspect is not taken into account in von neumann s idealized picture where a projective measurement is considered as an instantaneous process .",
    "it is therefore conceivable to consider arbitrarily frequent measurements which will lead to a total freezing of the dynamics , a phenomenon that is known as the zeno effect  @xcite . when a finite , but still sufficiently short time @xmath0 elapses between two measurements of the same observable the probability to consecutively find the system in the same eigenstate of the observable exponentially decreases with a rate that is proportional to the time @xmath0 separating two measurements .",
    "experimental verifications of the zeno effect are reported in refs .",
    "most recently , direct consequences of projective measurements have been discussed in different contexts such as thermodynamic control  @xcite , quantum tomography  @xcite , and fluctuation theorems  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we investigate the combined action of unobserved quantum motion and repeated projective measurements .",
    "in contrast to the standard treatment of the zeno effect , according to which the system is followed only until it has left the initial state for the first time we keep track of all possible outcomes up to a total observation time . in this way we take into account",
    "also realizations with intermediate deviations from and possibly multiple revivals of the initial state .",
    "this approach differs from the standard treatment of the zeno effect imposing selective measurements @xcite , which disregards the future fate of the system after it has left the initial state for the first time .",
    "we find for systems with finite - dimensional hilbert space that asymptotically , in the limit of infinitely many measurements , all states of the system acquire equal probability . hence , the probability to retrieve the initial state is given by the inverse of the hilbert space dimension .",
    "this result is universal and in particular does not depend on the time @xmath0 between two consecutive measurements as long as @xmath0 is different from zero .",
    "exceptions from this universal behavior are found only for those singular values of the time between measurements and of the system parameters for which an invariant state exists of that part of the system that is not directly effected by the measurement .",
    "the approach to the stationary state eventually becomes exponential .",
    "the corresponding decay rate is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath0 up to the time scale @xmath1 corresponding to the inverse of the largest energy difference of the system . for times larger than @xmath1 the decay rate shows a highly irregular behavior .",

    "ii is devoted to the introduction of the system and the measurement of interest . in sec .",
    "iii , we investigate the time evolution of the density matrix under the repeated measurements and point out the universality of the stationary state of equal probability , followed by a more detailed discussion and proof in sec .  iv .",

    "we consider the dynamics of a single particle on a lattice consisting of a single site , referred to as dot and a one - dimensional chain with @xmath2 sites acting as a reservoir . a schematic view of this system at different stages during a measurement cycle is presented in fig .  1 .",

    "we assume that only one end  @xmath13 of the chain is coupled to the dot .",
    "this model hamiltonian has various applications . on one hand",

    ", the observation of the dot - state occupancy corresponds to a selective measurement in the sense that the state reduction only removes dot - chain correlations but leaves the internal chain part of the state unchanged .",

    "it is also notable that independent of the time @xmath0 the population dominantly propagates through the chain with the velocity @xmath64 .",

    "the emergence of stationary states induced by repeated measurements was also reported for special systems  @xcite , but up to now , neither conditions for their existence have been known , nor their universality has been noticed . in the following we address these questions .",
    "the stationary solutions of the master equation ( [ it ] ) are invariant under the action of the map @xmath28 and therefore are solutions of @xmath74 .",
    "one shows by inspection that @xmath75 presents an invariant solution , where @xmath76 is the unit matrix . in the appendix  [ a ]",
    "we prove that other solutions may only exist if there is an invariant chain state , i.e. a state with @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "this situation is exceptional ; typically any chain state will evolve a dot component upon its unitary evolution .",
    "we note that the proof of the uniqueness of ( [ fp ] ) holds true for general systems with finite - dimensional hilbert space provided the measured observable possesses a non - degenerate eigenstate .",
    "the approach to the universal state ( [ fp ] ) therefore is not restricted to the special model ( [ h ] ) .",
    "most notably , the uniform state ( [ fp ] ) corresponds to the thermodynamic equilibrium at infinite temperature .",
    "apparently the repeated process of measurements `` heats up '' the system to an extreme degree .",
    "the relevant aspects of the dynamics in approaching this extreme state are displayed by the time evolution of the survival probability of the dot population which is experimentally easier to access than the whole density matrix .",

    "this is a manifestation of the quantum zeno effect caused by frequent measurements that obstruct the time evolution of a quantum state . for larger values of @xmath0 or after a large number of measurements , @xmath98 is no longer negligible ; consequently @xmath34 then deviates from unity and eventually converges to @xmath99 , unless the measurement time interval accidentally exactly matches with the period , @xmath100 , for which @xmath101 is one , see the expression for @xmath101 below eq .",

    "the smaller the time interval between the measurements is , the slower the decay of the survival probability becomes , in accordance with the zeno effect .",
    "for instance , for the uppermost curve ( @xmath103 ) , the survival probability stays close to unity even after @xmath104 measurements . on the other hand , for @xmath105 ,",
    "the decay becomes more rapid and @xmath72 quite soon converges towards its asymptotic value @xmath106 which is in agreement with the survival probability resulting from ( [ fp ] ) for @xmath42 .",

    "the asymptotic decay towards the uniform stationary state is exponential with a decay rate given by the eigenvalue @xmath109 whose absolute value is closest to unity . in practice",
    "though , the number of measurements to reach this asymptotic exponential decay regime may be extremely large due to the smallness of the coefficient @xmath132 and the presence of other eigenvalues close to unity in absolute value .",
    "this may lead to extremely long transients with exponential decay at larger rates than those following from @xmath109 , or even non - exponential decay laws .",
    "the eigenvalue @xmath109 closest to unity depends in a regular way on the length of the interval @xmath0 as long as @xmath0 is shorter than the fastest time scale @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the width of the spectrum of the total hamiltonian .",
    "the rate defined as the negative logarithm of @xmath135 , @xmath136 , vanishes at @xmath137 and starts to grow proportionally to @xmath138 , in accordance with the zeno effect . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] the scaling of the negative logarithm of @xmath135 by @xmath139 leads to a universal behavior of @xmath115 at small @xmath0 values . for values of @xmath0 larger than @xmath1 the dependence of the rate @xmath115 becomes very irregular and occasionally changes drastically from extremely small values corresponding to almost no decay of the survival probability to rather large values giving rise to rapid decay .",
    "finally we note without proof that a much simpler behavior emerges for an infinite chain with continuous energy spectrum and a spectral width which is much larger than any other energy scale . under these conditions",
    "the dot population decays exponentially even in the absence of any measurement , i.e. @xmath140 with @xmath141 .",
    "then and only then a history in which the dot state is left at some time will never show a recurrence of the dot population , or mathematically expressed @xmath142 . only in this case",
    "the traditional treatment of the zeno effect yields the actual survival probability at a time @xmath143 taking into account the full histories up to this time .",
    "we demonstrated that many measurements that are separated by finite periods of unitary time evolution lead to the universal infinite temperature state of equal probability .",
    "we expect this behavior also to apply for more general systems with finite dimensional hilbert space if they are subject to a large number of measurements of the occupancy of part of the system .",
    "this poses the question whether this result is a mere artifact of von neumann s instantaneous reduction postulate , on which our analysis was based , or whether the repeated interaction with a measuring device drives the system into this extreme state .",
