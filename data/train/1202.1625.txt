    "in astrophysics , the observation of a splitting of spectral lines in the visible and uv ranges for a few white dwarfs @xcite confirmed the existence of intense magnetic fields ( 0.1 - 10@xmath2 mg ) as predicted by blackett @xcite .",
    "the influence of a magnetic field on an atom modifies its emission or absorption lines .",
    "thanks to this property , known as zeeman effect , the detection of magnetic fields is possible at large distances , through the measured radiation .",
    "the linear and quadratic zeeman effects @xcite explain the separation of spectral lines and enable one to determine a value of the magnetic field .",
    "in the same way , pulsars and neutron stars having an even more intense magnetic field ( 10@xmath3 - 10@xmath4 mg ) have been discovered through their spectrum in the range of radio - frequencies and x - rays .",
    "there are numerous astrophysical applications , either direct or indirect , and requiring sometimes a sophisticated theoretical modeling .",
    "the methods differ according to the nature of the objects studied ( see table [ tab1 ] ) , the magnitude and the geometry of the magnetic fields , and to the quality of the observation in terms of sensitivity and spectral resolution .",
    "moreover , the variations of the magnetic field of stars during their rotation bring some information about their global geometry .",
    "the `` spectro - polarimetric '' methods exploit the additional recording of the circular polarization with respect to the wavelength .",
    "this enables one to obtain a detailed map of the field @xcite through a separation of its components parallel or perpendicular to the line of sight .",
    "strong magnetic fields are also encountered , for instance , in magneto - inertial fusion @xcite .",
    "inserting a magnetic field into inertial - confinement - fusion capsules before compressing them @xcite presents the advantages to suppress the electron thermal - conduction losses and to better control the @xmath5-particle energy deposition .",
    "the magnetic fields generated inside a hohlraum can reach a few mg .",
    ".orders of magnitude of magnetic fields encountered in astrophysics ( 1 mg=10@xmath6 g=100 t ) . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     if needed , the evaluation of @xmath7 can be refined .",
    "for instance , it is possible to calculate an average value of @xmath8 depending only on @xmath9 .",
    "this can be achieved using the sum rule @xcite    @xmath10    which states that the sum of the land factors for any given @xmath9 is independent of the coupling conditions .",
    "such a property stems from the fact that the trace of a matrix is invariant under an orthogonal transformation .",
    "one can thus define an average land factor associated to a given value of @xmath9 :    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the number of levels having angular momentum @xmath9 @xcite , which can be evaluated recursively @xcite , in a similar manner to @xmath13 ( see eq .",
    "( [ recsl ] ) ) .",
    "the same methodology can be applied in order to determine analytically the moments of the hyperfine components of a line .",
    "the hyperfine operator in the subspace corresponding to the relevant nucleus and atomic level reads :    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the magnetic hyperfine - structure constant of the level @xmath16 . the @xmath17-order moment of the hyperfine components",
    "is provided by the expression    @xmath18^n\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times\\langle\\gamma jifm|\\mathcal{z}_q^{(1)}|\\gamma jifm\\rangle^2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath19 is the @xmath20-component of the dipole operator @xmath21 .",
    "the @xmath9-file sum rule @xcite enables one to simplify the expression of the strength :    @xmath22=\\frac{1}{3}[i , j],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and therefore    @xmath23}\\sum_{f , f'}\\left(a_jx_{fij}-a_{j'}x_{f'ij'}\\right)^n\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times\\langle f||\\mathcal{z}^{(1)}||f'\\rangle^2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath24 .",
    "equation ( [ mn0 ] ) can be written    @xmath25}\\sum_{f , f'}[f , f']\\left(a_jx_{fij}-a_{j'}x_{f'ij'}\\right)^n\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times\\langle ( ij)f||\\mathcal{z}^{(1)}||(ij)f'\\rangle^2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    or    @xmath26}\\sum_{f , f'}[f , f']\\left(a_jx_{fij}-a_{j'}x_{f'ij'}\\right)^n\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times{\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ccc}f & 1 & f ' \\\\ j ' & i & j \\end{array}\\right\\}}^2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the case where @xmath27 or @xmath28 is equal to 0 , the calculation is very simple @xcite . in the general case , using    @xmath29}{\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ccc}f & j & i \\\\ 1 & i & j \\end{array}\\right\\}},\\ ] ]    one has to calculate :    @xmath30{\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ccc}f & j & i \\\\ 1 & i & j \\end{array}\\right\\}}^{k_1}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times{\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ccc}f ' & j ' & i \\\\ 1 & i & j ' \\end{array}\\right\\}}^{k_2}{\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ccc}f & 1 & f ' \\\\ j ' & i & j \\end{array}\\right\\}}^2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    which can be done using graphical methods @xcite .",
    "another approach consists in adopting another point of view , leading to the evaluation of quantities of the type :    @xmath31(\\bar{f}-a)^n\\ ] ]    where @xmath32 is a constant ( depending on other quantum numbers ) .",
    "such a quantity can be expressed , as for the zeeman effect , in terms of bernoulli numbers ( see appendix b ) :    @xmath33    the splitting of @xmath27 components in a weak magnetic field @xcite is in every way similar to the splitting of @xmath9 levels .",
    "the scale of the splitting is determined by the factor @xmath34 , which is defined by    @xmath35    and connected with the land factor by    @xmath36",
    "in this work , a statistical modeling of electric dipolar lines in the presence of an intense magnetic field was proposed .",
    "the formalism requires the moments of the zeeman components of a line @xmath37 , which can be obtained analytically in terms of the quantum numbers and land factors .",
    "it was found that the fourth - order a - type gram - charlier expansion series provides better results than the usual development in powers of the magnetic field often used in radiative - transfer models . using",
    "our recently published recursive method for the numbering of ls - terms of an arbitrary configuration , a simple approach to estimate the contribution of a magnetic field to the width ( and higher - order moments ) of a transition array of e1 lines was presented .",
    "we hope that such results will be useful for the interpretation of z - pinch absorption or emission spectra , for the study of laser - induced magnetic fields in inertial - fusion studies , for the modeling of magnetized stars as well as for any application involving magnetic fields in spectroscopic studies of atomic and molecular systems .",

    "using second - order ts expansion ( [ iq2 ] ) and assuming the knowledge of the variance @xmath62 of the other broadening mechanisms , it becomes possible to estimate the magnitude of the magnetic field from the measurement of the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the line @xmath63 .                  this simple formula ( [ est ] ) can provide an estimation of the magnetic field , even if the other broadening mechanisms ( stark , electron collisions , doppler , autoionization ) are dominant .",
