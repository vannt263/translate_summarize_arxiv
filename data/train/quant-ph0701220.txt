    "besides the attention that modern physics pays to entanglement in virtue of the role it plays in testing fundamental properties of quantum systems , there is an enormous interest in developing strategies and protocols allowing for the manipulation of these intimately quantum mechanical correlations between discrete as well as continuous variable systems .",
    "even though its role in computational processes is not yet fully understood and is the subject of intriguing investigations , it is nowadays recognized that the ability of manipulating entanglement is crucial for many tasks in quantum communication and , in general , quantum information processing ( qip ) .    over the past two decades",
    ", we have witnessed many proposals for the generation of entangled pairs of quantum systems , in various settings  @xcite .",
    "for instance , it has become a routine procedure in linear optics qip with discrete variables , in which parametric down conversion is used  @xcite and in its continuous variable version , where two - mode squeezed states are effortlessly produced by non - degenerate optical parametric amplifiers . in different contexts , entanglement of pairs of atoms  @xcite , trapped ions  @xcite , superconducting devices  @xcite and atom - photon systems  @xcite has already been demonstrated .    regardless of the efficiency with which it can be generated , entanglement is undoubtedly a fragile resource , susceptible to the detrimental effects of communication channels and environmental interactions that result in a degradation of the desired  quality \" of the quantum resource .",
    "this is particularly true in a scenario of distributed qip , where the exchange of high - quality entangled states ( which should be as pure as possible and carrying a full ebit of quantum correlations ) is necessary in order to realize perfectly efficient computational protocols .",
    "this has lead to the development of strategies to increase the entanglement and purity of mixed , non - maximally entangled states @xcite .",
    "so far , experimental realizations of entanglement purification schemes have been limited to linear optics  @xcite and trapped - ions  @xcite .",
    "though lacking such a demonstration , microwave cavity - quantum electrodynamics ( cqed ) holds great promise as a medium for qip .",
    "strong coupling between atoms and field modes allows for the creation  @xcite and distribution  @xcite of entanglement , and the performance of quantum logic operations  @xcite .",
    "the new high finesse cavities  @xcite demonstrated by kuhr _",
    "et al . _ improve the feasibility a system of distributed qip employing atoms as flying qubits , and cavity field modes as relatively long - lived static qubits .",
    "this system would clearly be enhanced by methods for improving degraded entanglement .",
    "suggestions have been made for cqed purification schemes that recover entanglement only from decoherence due to cavity decay  @xcite , or that rely on repeated interactions of the cavity modes with a single flying atom  @xcite . here , we propose schemes for the concentration of pure - state entanglement , and the distillation of pure - state entanglement from werner states ( assuming a sufficiently large fraction of any bell state ) and maximally entangled mixed states ( mems )  @xcite .",

    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ concentration ] we introduce the interaction model used throughout this investigation and describe the protocol for the concentration of entanglement that represents the first part of our study .",
    "this probabilistic entanglement concentration is accompanied by a simultaneous interconversion from flying - qubit to stationary - qubit entanglement .",
    "we prove that a sufficiently long interaction time allows for the concentration of entanglement to the maximal value of a full ebit with the highest probability being theoretically allowed .",
    "the scheme requires resources that can be prepared off - line and is extremely close to ideal efficiency for values of the experimentally relevant parameters attainable with present - day technology . in sec .",
    "[ purification ] we analyze an entanglement purification protocol that , when operating on mixed bell - diagonal states , extracts a progressively more entangled and pure two - qubit state .",

    "we highlight how the recent achievements in this field allow for a foreseeable implementation of our proposals .",

    "this is , evidently , the case for neutral atoms or quantum dots coupled to optical or microwave fields  @xcite . on the other hand ,",

    "as already mentioned , we will explicitly address microwave cavity- and circuit - qed set - ups , which are two of the most promising scenarios for quantum information processing and communication , as stated in the los alamos roadmap  @xcite .",

    "@xcite , of superconducting cavities sustaining a field mode of frequency @xmath226 ghz , length @xmath227 mm and energy damping time @xmath228 ms .",
    "this corresponds to a cavity finesse @xmath229 , where @xmath230 is the speed of light .",
    "as previously mentioned , the coherence time of the overall system depends also on the damping time of the excited state of the flying qubits ( each encoded in circular states with principle quantum numbers @xmath76 and @xmath231 of a rydberg atom ) , which is comparable to @xmath232 . the atomic transition frequency ( @xmath233 ghz ) can be tuned in and out of resonance with the cavity field by means of a d.c .",
    "stark shift induced by a static electric field parallel to the cavity axis ( this field also helps preserve the circularity of the atomic states ) .",
    "this technique can be used to control the interaction time between each flying atom and the corresponding cavity field .",
    "the interaction time is also dependent on the atomic velocity across the resonator , which is usually in the range of hundreds of m.s@xmath234 , with an experimental accuracy well - within @xmath235 .",
    "the effect of this uncertain atomic velocity on the concentration protocol is discussed in section  [ concentration ] .",
    "the large atomic dipole moment ( @xmath236 where @xmath237 is the electron charge and @xmath238 is the bohr radius ) allows for the achievement of a strong coupling regime characterized by @xmath239 khz .",
    "this value guarantees the possibility of performing @xmath86 rabi floppings ( _ i.e. _ @xmath240 ) within @xmath94  @xcite , putting the requirement for a long upper bound on the rescaled interaction time ( as stated for the concentration protocol ) within the present state of the art .",
    "atomic state detection , necessary for both the concentration and the purification scheme , can be accurately performed with state - selective field - ionization channeltrons ( each having a detection - error between @xmath241 and @xmath242 ) . with the new generation of high - finesse cavities addressed above",
    ", the atomic injection is performed through large apertures , allowing for the screening of the flying qubits from coherence - destroying stray fields at the surface of the cavity mirrors .    in a circuit - qed setup ,",
    "flying atoms are replaced by static superconducting qubits embodied by squids working in the charge regime at the degeneracy point ( to remove , to first order in the single - cooper pair charge @xmath243 , the detrimental effect of low - frequency noise induced by background impurities )  @xcite .",
    "the qubit is integrated , via conventional optical lithography , in a full - wave , on - chip , coplanar waveguide cavity with resonant frequency @xmath244 ghz ( the microstrip resonator ) , located at a voltage antinode of the sustained field mode and capacitively coupled to it .",
    "the stripline is a quasi - unidimensional structure with a very small transversal dimension that reduces the effective volume of the cavity field and enhances the coupling rate with the qubit .",
    "this , together with the effective dipole moment of the squid qubit ( @xmath245 ) gives rise to the ratio @xmath246 .",
    "the energy damping time of the stripline is conservatively assumed to be @xmath247s , giving @xmath248 , which would , in principle , allow for a large number of coherent rabi floppings within the cavity lifetime ( experimental evidence puts the qubit damping rate in the range of @xmath249s ) , in complete analogy with the cavity - qed setting described above .",
    "a detailed derivation of the qubit - stripline coupling hamiltonian and the resulting coupling strength can be found in paternostro _",
    "et al . _",
    ".    the transition energy of the superconducting qubit can be adjusted through an external magnetic flux that modulates the josephson energy of the squid  @xcite in such a way that the qubit can be easily put in the strong resonant or dispersive regime with the field .",
    "this tuning ability is the basis of the experimentally demonstrated non - demolition measurement of the qubit state , through spectroscopic resolution of the field s frequency - pulling effect  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the projection of a qubit required by our schemes can be reliably implemented by using an ancillary cavity field mode , differing in frequency or polarization with respect to the mode singled out for the realization of our protocols , along the lines depicted in  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the same technique can be used in order to perform a photon - number - resolving cavity field measurement : the qubit spectrum exhibits a peak that is shifted , with respect to the empty cavity situation , by a quantity depending on the population of the field mode .",
    "the integration of more than a single squid qubit in the stripline , in a way that avoids ( inductive ) cross - talk between the qubits , is achievable , the main difficulty being the necessity of separating each qubit s gate voltage  @xcite to properly set each working point .",
    "as opposed to cavity - qed , however , the entanglement between superconducting qubits in circuit - qed has yet to be experimentally demonstrated , despite promising steps having been performed along these lines  @xcite .    for the sake of completeness",
    ", we here mention that a scheme for the preparation of mems has been suggested , both in cavity- and circuit - qed , in ref .",
    ". we refer you to these works for an extensive account of the details necessary for this procedure .",
    "we have presented two schemes for entanglement concentration and purification for qubit systems .",
    "our protocols are explicitly designed in settings involving qubits interacting with ancillary cavity fields , which can be implemented in cavity- and circuit - qed set - ups .",
    "our entanglement concentration scheme conserves espp , therefore being optimal , and achieves the maximum theoretical probability of producing a maximally entangled state of two qubits .",
    "the state purification protocol can be iterated so as to return a state of arbitrary purity , although the success probability decreases exponentially as perfect purity is approached .",
    "the required resources are modest .",
    "we need cavities prepared in zero- and single - photon states , which have been experimentally demonstrated , and the ability to perform single - atom rotations and measurements , which is possible with high accuracy and large detection efficiencies .",
    "in addition , we require cavity - field measurements , which can be achieved in an indirect way : we have addressed strategies for this step in both of the proposed experimental scenarios .",
    "the mechanisms that constitute the main sources of imperfection and error have been quantitatively assessed to provide a comprehensive analysis of the protocols at hand .",
    "we hope that the evidence for state - of - the - art implementability of our schemes and the astonishing improvements in the control of microwave - based quantum technology will pave the way to the realization of entanglement concentration and purification in cavity- and circuit - qed systems .",
