    "the question of how the adsorption of foreign particles affects the properties of materials and the means to control this is of central importance in domains ranging from separation processes to nanotechnology .",
    "this motivates the continuing investigation on the factors determining the adsorption process and the search of conditions most favorable for its control ( composition of the adsorbing fluid , adsorption geometry etc . )",
    "the purpose of this communication is to propose a novel method that allows this , on the basis of monte carlo simulations of a fluid - slit pore equilibrium . to avoid having to consider specific interactions as in molecular adsorption",
    ", we choose to point out the basic mechanisms on a simple model with only hard - sphere and dipolar interactions .",
    "the situation closest to this model is then the adsorption of macroparticles .",
    "another reason is the recent development of studies of colloidal adsorption @xcite .",
    "indeed , while numerous studies exist on molecular adsorption ( see for e.g. @xcite and refs @xcite for more recent work ) , one practical advantage of using colloids is the possibility to tune their effective interaction ( eg . by adding polymeric depletants ) and their coupling with external fields , possibly in confined geometry @xcite .",
    "the actual behavior may , however , be complicated by the interplay of different effects ( see for example the role of static and hydrodynamic forces in microfluidics devices @xcite ) .",
    "we thus propose here a method that allows a fine control of the composition of the adsorbed fluid , while remaining very simple .",
    "we start with the simplest confinement geometry : an open slit pore with parallel walls in equilibrium with a bulk fluid .",
    "it has been used in several theoretical studies to determine the parameters affecting the behavior of the confined fluid , ( see for example gubbins , sarkisov , duda1,jcpabd , jpcgub , virgiliis , duda2,kim and references therein ) . since we seek a method in which the pore geometry , the interactions ( between the particles and the particles and the confining medium ) as well as the bulk thermodynamic state are fixed , one alternative is the coupling with an external field .",
    "this should always be possible since besides particles having a permanent dipole such as magnetic colloids , colloidal particles are always polarizable to some extent .",
    "we thus took a uniform electric field @xmath0 normal to the walls .",
    "as in jcpcharles we considered a mixture in which one species bears a dipole moment @xmath1 , taken permanent for simplicity .",
    "the field is then not applied in the bulk .",
    "we thus have pure hard - spheres ( species 1 ) and dipolar hard - spheres ( species 2 ) , possibly with a non - additive diameter@xmath2 in the potential @xmath3 ( see also the discussion of figure 5 ) .",
    "both species  have a hard - sphere interactions with the walls .",
    "this makes the model more appropriate @xcite to a mixture of hard - sphere - like colloidal particles , than to a molecular mixture ( see however the final remarks ) .",
    "the effect of an external field ( and temperature ) on the filling of a cylindrical pore was also studied in @xcite ( see also and bratko for a slit pore ) , but not from a bulk mixture .",
    "previous studies considered the role of the pressure in one - component fluids ( eg . sarkisov ) , or the total density and the mole fractions duda1,duda2,kim in bulk mixtures but without field .",
    "as shown below , the combination of both will play here a crucial role . an inhomogeneous multicomponent mixture with anisotropic interactions being difficult to study by analytical methods ( we are aware of one study by density functional theory of the adsorption from a mixture of polar molecules @xcite ) , we used monte carlo simulation ( see also , for e.g. rasaiah , klapp , rasaiah2,weis , jcpcharles ) .",
    "we already pointed out how the structure can be modulated by the combination of various interactions jcpabd , jpcgub and by the action of the field @xcite .",
    "however , only the density profile of the particles through the pore could be modulated in @xcite since the total number of particles was kept fixed ( simulations in the canonical ensemble ) .",
    "an important difference here is that we consider an open pore which exchanges particles with a reservoir .",
    "one may then achieve much stronger variations of the density of each component in the pore .",
    "the physical pore is assumed large enough that the interfacial region in which it is in contact with the reservoir  plays a negligible role @xcite .",
    "for this reason we will refer to the fluid in the reservoir far from this region as the `` bulk '' .",
    "the pore / fluid equilibrium is determined by the equality of the chemical potentials @xmath4 and @xmath5 of both species in the bulk and in the pore .",
    "but since the practical control variables are the total density @xmath6 and mole fraction @xmath7 of the dipolar species , in the bulk , the latter is studied in the canonical ensemble . by considering only homogeneous states or metastable states very close to the coexistence boundary , @xmath8 and @xmath9 in the bulk",
    "are determined with sufficient accuracy from widom s insertion method ( see for eg @xcite for this point ) . @xmath8 and @xmath9 are then used to study the fluid in the pore in the grand - canonical ensemble .",
    "we can then compute the average density of each species in the pore as a function of @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "hereafter , reduced variables @xmath10 and @xmath11 will be used .",
    "the reduced density in the pore is @xmath12 , with @xmath13 the average number of particles for a lateral surface @xmath14 with periodic conditions in the @xmath15 and @xmath16 directions and @xmath17 the accessible volume in the pore .",
    "we took a pore width @xmath18 . in the bulk",
    ", @xmath19 is fixed .",
    "we show in figure 1 the first basic mechanism : a field induced filling of the pore by a one - component dipolar fluid . at increasing field strength @xmath20 ,",
    "the pore is progressively filled by the dipoles with a rate that depends on @xmath21 . for the value of the @xmath22 and @xmath23 used here",
    ", the explanation seems that the field - dipole interaction energy @xmath24 offsets the entropy loss due to their orientation in the direction of the field .",
    "this is more visible at low @xmath25 in which case the slope is nearly constant beyond @xmath26 . for a particle diameter of @xmath27 and @xmath28 , for example",
    ", this corresponds to @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "thanks to the scaling factor @xmath31 in its definition , the same value of @xmath32 is also appropriate for the dipolar interaction between _ molecular _ species .     is the total density in the pore and @xmath33 the field strength in reduced units .",
    "the bulk density is @xmath34 ( _ filled squares _ ) and @xmath35 ( _ empty squares _ ) .",
    "the lines are a guide to the eye . ]",
    "the dipole moment being then of the order of one debye , a field strength of the order @xmath36 is needed to obtain the same reduced energy @xmath37 .",
    "such field strengths are not unusual for confinement at the molecular scale ( for water in nanopores see for example @xcite and @xcite , in particular figure 1 in the last one ) .",
    "note that the equilibrium state in presence of the field may not always be the filled one at other parameters or if more complex interactions are considered ( see ref @xcite for example ) , due to the competition between energetic and entropic contributions .",
    "figure 2 illustrates the second mechanism : the relative population of a pore in equilibrium with a mixture having a natural tendency to demix .",
    "the simplest one is the mixture of non - additive hard spheres @xcite in which the cross diameter is @xmath38 previous studies @xcite have shown that when the pore is in equilibrium with a mixture in which one species is in minority ( say @xmath39 for a non additivity parameter @xmath40 ) a population inversion occurs in the pore when the total bulk density is varied .",
    "this occurs here for @xmath41 between @xmath42 and @xmath43 for a pure non - additive hs mixture and between @xmath44 and @xmath42 for the hard - sphere dipole mixture .    having the basic ingredients",
    ", we may now combine them to produce the desired effect : by choosing the composition of the bulk fluid so as to be close to the population inversion in the pore , we anticipate that the closer we are from the threshold density the weaker will be the external field @xmath45 required to trigger it .",
    "this is shown in figure 3 . in the most favorable case",
    "shown the actual value of @xmath46 is about @xmath47 .",
    "and bulk densities ( from right to left ) @xmath48 .",
    "the inset shows the corresponding dipoles and hard - spheres density in the pore for @xmath49 . ]",
    "a small variation of the applied field produces the inversion : the dipolar particles are selectively absorbed by a weak change about @xmath46 , the converse being possible , perhaps with some hysteresis @xcite . near the adorption jump ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 for @xmath52 ) a slight change in temperature ( @xmath53 in figure 4 ) produces a detectable change in adsorption .    ,",
    "@xmath54 and @xmath55 from left to right .",
    "the bulk mole fraction is @xmath56 and bulk densities are @xmath57 . here",
    "@xmath58 . ]",
    "this observation may be important for some applications ( since the reduced variables combine @xmath59 and @xmath60 with t , while @xmath61 in the bulk , one has to rescale @xmath62 by the factor @xmath63 to compare two temperatures at a given values of @xmath59 ) .    finally ,",
    "in order to check the effect of a different interaction @xmath64 between species 1 and 2 , we also show in figure 5 the result for a yukawa repulsive potential .",
    "is the density of the dipolar species , in the pore . _",
    "empty squares _ : one - component dipolar fluid ( for @xmath65 as in figure 1 ) ; _ open circles _ : additive mixture of hard spheres and dipoles ( with @xmath56 and @xmath66 in the bulk ) .",
    "_ diamonds _ : same for a yukawa repulsion between the dipoles and the hard - spheres ; _ filled circles _ : same for the non - additive hard - spheres - dipolar hard - spheres mixture .",
    "the range of the yukawa potential ( with @xmath67 ) gives the same contribution to the second virial coefficient as the non - additive hard - spheres potential with @xmath40 .",
    "_ filled squares _ : one - component dipolar fluid with @xmath66 ( as in figure 1 ) .",
    "]    we observe that the phenomenon is quite general .",
    "the requirement for observing a sensitive field effect is that the self coordination should be more favored in the mixture .",
    "the poor miscibility can be favored by suitable chemical composition of the particles surface layers pusey , hennequin .",
    "weak specific interaction with the pore walls can be achieved similarly .    as our main goal was",
    "to demonstrate the phenomenon of a field activated adsorption from an unstable mixture , we used a simple simulation strategy .",
    "accordingly , we did not conduct a detailed study of the behavior of the confined fluid .",
    "for instance , phase equilibrium in the pore may take place before the spontaneous condensation ( adsorption jump ) predicted in the grand canonical simulation @xcite . according to duda al.@xcite ,",
    "the inversion line for non - additive hard spheres is close to the bulk fluid coexistence line but the two phenomena are different .",
    "we actually observed that the inversion corresponds to a bulk fluid close to demixing or slightly in the two - phase region .",
    "regardless of this , the essential point is that the density in the liquid - like phase should be close to the value after the adsorption jump , as in one - component systems @xcite .",
    "the precise relation between these observations and other phenomena such as capillary condensation , wetting , hysteresis , etc .",
    "( see e.g. wetting , neimarkpre , kierlik ) will be discussed in future work .",
    "in conclusion , these results show that the combination of two generic mechanisms allows a quite sensitive control of the pore filling .",
    "although this method has been demonstrated for particles that are closest to the optimum conditions ( ie hard - sphere - like colloids ) , none of them is exclusive and since the basic mechanisms ( demixing instability and coupling with an external field ) are quite generic , this prediction should concern a broader class of systems ( including molecular ones ) . in order to benefit from the field effect , one species should be either polar ( e.g. ferrocolloid in magnetic fields ) or much more polarizable than the other ( the results given here being relative to permanent dipoles ) .",
    "the solution should also not contain free charges to avoid particle motion due to the action of the field ( electrohydrodynamic flows ) , not considered in this simple model .",
    "polar molecules being on the other hand rather common , one should consider in this case also the role of specific interactions .",
    "we believe that further experimental studies and simulations on this method are worthwhile given the diversity of possible applications of this field controlled composition of the confined fluid and hence flexible control of the physical properties that depend on the composition of the confined fluid .",
    "just as an example , one may consider to modulate in this way the dielectric response of the confined fluid for optical applications .",
