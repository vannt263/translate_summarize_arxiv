    "we calculate the spectra by neglecting the distortion effects and by reducing the strength of the imaginary part of the optical potentials to im@xmath139/5 to confirm our expectation in the ideal cases . we have found that our expectation is correct and the spectra with the phenomenological optical potential is suppressed significantly in both target cases .",
    "the spectra with the chiral unitary potential , which do not provide the kaonic nuclear states with the same quantum number as the valence neutron states , have significantly larger absolute values than those with the phenomenological potential as expected .",

    "thus , we can deduce the information of the phase of the @xmath19 in eq .",
    "( [ func : atau ] ) from the shape of the spectra . on the other hand ,",
    "the simple fit by the lorentz distributions is not suited for these spectra and we should be careful to extract the resonance energies and the widths from the data .",
    "we study the formation spectra of the deeply bound kaonic atoms theoretically in this paper .",
    "the deeply bound atomic states can not be observed by the standard x  ray spectroscopy , however , theoretical calculations have shown the existence of the narrow ( quasi  stable ) bound states beyond the accessible levels by the x  ray method .",
    "we show the calculated results of the binding energies and widths of the deeply bound kaonic atom states with the phenomenological and the chiral unitary optical potentials .    as the formation reactions of the deeply bound states , we consider the missing mass spectroscopy by the ( @xmath0 ) reactions .",
    "we consider the various target nuclei and the different incident energies , and show the expected ( @xmath21 ) spectra systematically .",
    "we also consider ( @xmath126 ) reactions in several cases .",
    "and we also compare the expected spectra of the different optical potentials obtained by the phenomenological fit and the chiral unitary model .",
    "we have found that the expected spectra always show the interesting structures for various target cases with the clear signals of the atomic states formation .",
    "the origin of the interesting structure is also considered .",
    "we show that the argument of the pole contribution of the spectral function is important and we should be careful to deduce the resonance energies and widths from the data .",
    "the effects due to the existence of the kaonic nuclear states are also investigated .",
    "we show that the exotic nuclear states with less absorptive interaction will be identified by observing the atomic states by the missing mass spectroscopy using the transport particles at the recoilless kinematics .",
    "finally , we would like to make a few comments on the importance of the experimental investigations of this research . as shown in the present article ,",
    "the structures of the deeply bound kaonic atoms are very robust and all optical potentials , which reproduce the existing shallow atomic data , are expected to provide the similar predictions for the deeply bound atomic states .",
    "thus , to confirm the predicted structures by the experiments is of great importance because the all optical potentials could be denied by the one experiment which proves no  existence of the deeply bound atoms",
    ". it could happen if we all miss the important ingredients of the kaon  nucleus interactions for higher densities .",
    "thus , we think that it is very important to investigate the structures of the deeply bound kaonic atoms experimentally .",
    "we hope that our results stimulate the experimental activities of the study of the deeply bound kaonic atoms , even it is very hard to observe these states .",
