    "instabilities of several varieties are known to form in ionization fronts ( i - fronts ) in the galaxy today , giving rise to structures like elephant trunks and bright rims in star - forming regions of the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "two prominent types are shadow instabilities @xcite and thin - shell instabilities @xcite , which usually manifest as fingers of ionized gas protruding ahead of the front .",
    "shadow instabilities form when a density fluctuation is advected through an r - type front , creating a dimple that first elongates but then stabilizes .",
    "when the front becomes d - type , the dimple can erupt in a jet if the shocked gas radiatively cools and forms a cold dense shell liable to fragmentation .",
    "radiation escapes through fissures in the shell , causing the dimple to fracture and jet forward .",
    "thin - shell instabilities arise when a d - type front encounters a density perturbation .",
    "if the prefront shocked gas efficiently cools , the perturbation triggers a vishniac instability @xcite in the shell ; if not , the shell may instead fracture due to rayleigh - taylor instabilities @xcite . either way",
    ", radiation rapidly destabilizes the perturbations by escaping through cracks in the shell and driving ionized extensions of gas much larger than the original disturbance into the surrounding medium . in a previous paper",
    ", we examined the topology of both types of instabilities in the ism @xcite , confirming that their violence was determined by the cooling efficiency of the shocked gas .",
    "h ii regions appeared at the redshifts of first structure formation @xcite , beginning with the formation of isolated massive stars in the first dark matter halos of mass @xmath5 1.0 @xmath1 10@xmath6 m@xmath7 at @xmath8 20 - 30 @xcite and continuing with the rise of the first stellar populations in primeval galaxies a few hundred myr later .",
    "whether i - front instabilities could form in pristine h and he at high redshifts is a key question in early cosmological reionization and structure formation for several reasons .",
    "first , they may have regulated uv escape from the first stars and galaxies , which has risen sharply in importance with the recent discovery of substantial free electron optical depths at by the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ ( wmap ) @xcite , implying that cosmological reionization began much earlier than previously expected .",
    "second , i - front instabilities may have created density condensations prone to clumping and later collapse , forming new generations of stars .",
    "third , the mixing of metals from the first supernovae with remnants of i - front instabilities in relic h ii regions determined the extent to which the early intergalactic medium ( igm ) was chemically enriched .",
    "contamination of instability relics may fracture and collapse them on mass scales very different from the stars that created them @xcite , abruptly splitting the primordial initial mass function ( imf ) into a low - mass branch in just one generation . on the other hand ,",
    "if saturated i - front instabilities drive turbulent flows , they may have supported clouds in minihalos or protogalaxies from collapse , postponing rather than promoting star formation @xcite . finally , recent work by @xcite suggests that ionization fronts penetrating molecular cloud cores in the ism may develop unstable modes that reach the centers of the core before the front .",
    "this may disrupt collapse of cloud cores into new stars , both in the galaxy and at high redshifts .    given the central role of radiative cooling in modulating i - front instabilities in the ism",
    ", one might question whether they arose at all in primordial ionized flows , in which the atomic or molecular hydrogen cooling is far less efficient .",
    "cosmological ionization fronts also differed from their galactic counterparts in being driven by the hard uv and soft x - ray spectra of pop iii stars and miniquasars . such spectra exhibit",
    "a range of photon mean free paths that can , depending on the ambient density , greatly broaden the front , in some cases to as much as the hubble distance .",
    "it is unclear what impact the broadening of the front would have on the formation and evolution of unstable modes in i - fronts ; the temperature precursor preceding such fronts may preempt their formation entirely .",
    "we have performed three - dimensional radiation hydrodynamical calculations of ionization front instabilities in which multifrequency radiative transfer is coupled to nine species primordial chemistry .",
    "we explore the formation of thin - shell and shadow instabilities in both primordial and incrementally - enriched gas in idealized geometries to disentangle their evolution from other features imprinted on the front by density imhomogeneities in real cosmological objects .",
    "as primordial fronts exit minihalos and protogalaxies they will encounter structures on several spatial scales that shape the global morphology of the final h ii region ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for example , halos hosting population iii ( pop iii ) star formation exhibit filamentary inflows and other departures from sphericity on 100 pc scales @xcite .",
    "however , protostellar infall likely settles into an accretion disk on 1000 au scales , collimating the emergent front into biconical flows above and below the plane of the disk @xcite .",
    "transverse gas velocities inherited from the angular momentum of the parent dark matter halo further complicate breakout of the nascent front on intermediate scales .",
    "we survey the formation of instabilities in primordial fronts in advance of multiscale simulations of uv breakout from primeval stars and and galaxies .    in @xmath9 2",
    "we describe the multifrequency upgrades to our photon - conserving radiative transfer in the zeus - mp reactive flow physics code documented in @xcite .",

    "we present our numerical models of d - type i - front instabilities due to thin - shell modes with atomic and molecular cooling .",
    "we follow the evolution of shadow instabilities associated with pop iii blackbody spectra in @xmath9 5 , pinpoint the threshold at which metal line cooling triggers thin - shell instabilities in d - type fronts in @xmath9 6 , and conclude in @xmath9 7 .",
    "the monoenergetic radiative transfer in our previous studies does not capture postfront gas temperatures from first principles or the natural broadening of fronts by hard uv photons .",
    "it also neglects molecular hydrogen dissociation by lyman - werner photons and photodetachment of h@xmath10 , key processes that regulate the abundance of h@xmath0 , an important coolant in primordial gas . here",
    "we describe modifications to our numerical method @xcite for computing radiative rate coefficients with a multifrequency algorithm that preserves photon conservation .    constraining the number of absorptions in a zone due to all processes to equal the number of photons entering the cell minus those exiting leads to @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the total optical depth of the cell ( the sum is over all removal processes ) .",
    "equations 1 and 2 are true for a single energy and therefore hold if summed over all energies . the total absorption rates n@xmath13 are necessary to determine the flux that reaches the next zone . on the other hand ,",
    "the rate for a single removal process is a function of an attenuation factor that does not involve any of the other types of absorptions : @xmath14 where @xmath15 @xmath16 n@xmath17r , the optical depth to that interaction .",
    "the sum of the individual rates evaluated in this manner is inconsistent with n@xmath13 , but the two can be reconciled by enforcing @xmath18 this formulation guarantees that the sum of the rates matches the total rate associated with the optical depth of the zone ( thus preserving photon conservation ) while properly binning individual reactions according to their numbers . we evaluate rate coefficients ( where k@xmath19 @xmath16 n@xmath19/(nv@xmath20 ) , where @xmath21 is the gas number density ) at every frequency , assuming the photon emission rate @xmath22(@xmath23 ) at that frequency , and sum them to obtain the total coefficient for the entire spectrum .",

    "the hard uv photons in the spectrum transit a range of mean free paths in the neutral gas , broadening the front to approximately 5 pc .",
    "free electron abundances at temperatures of a few thousand k in the finite width of the front rapidly catalyze h@xmath0 production by the h@xmath10 and h@xmath45 channels : @xmath59 @xmath60 the peak h@xmath10 and h@xmath45 abundances are in step with the h@xmath0 peak , as expected since they are the key intermediaries for molecular hydrogen production in these relatively low densities .",

    "five mechanisms that cool primordial h and he in i - front shocks are electron collisional and ionizational cooling , recombinational cooling , bremsstrahlung , and compton cooling ( primarily in the early universe ) .",
    "the free electrons required for these processes are present in minute quantities ( n@xmath61/n@xmath62 @xmath50 1 @xmath1 10@xmath63 ) at high redshifts and are either remnants of the recombination era or created in cosmological shocks .",
    "these channels cool h and he far less efficiently than metal lines in the ism at t @xmath64 5000 k. however , as discussed in @xmath9 [ sect : mnu ] , molecular hydrogen may form in the i - fronts of very massive pop iii stars @xcite and significantly raise cooling rates in the neutral gas .",

    "however , the role of h@xmath0 cooling in primordial i - front instabilities is unclear because massive stars with strong ionizing luminosities are also intense sources of lyman - werner ( lw ) photons that dissociate h@xmath0 . with energies below the ionization limit",

    "metal line cooling is eight orders of magnitude greater than recombinations or compton scattering .",
    "indeed , if no cooling cutoff whatsoever was employed with the metal lines they would quickly collapse the shocked gas to very dense cold shell whose final thickness is bounded from below only by numerical resolution .",
    "we note that the compton component is highly dependent on redshift ; had this simulation been performed at z = 35 , inverse compton scattering would have dominated recombinations in the postshock shell .",

    "can atomic cooling in h and he alone incite dynamical instabilities in d - type primordial ionization fronts ? in this section",
    "we address both vishniac and rayleigh - taylor instabilities driven by ionization fronts in perturbed spherically - symmetric density gradients .",
    "our one - dimensional model in @xmath9 [ 3.1 ] revealed that i - front shocks cooled only by atomic h and he were indistinguishable from nonradiating shocks and therefore are not susceptible to vishniac instabilities . to verify this prediction we performed a three - dimensional simulation with monoenergetic photons to prevent any complications due to multifrequency broadening of the front . in this",

    "the density knots in the shock located above and below the midplane of the jets at their base in the @xcite run are also visible in this run at first but they rapidly dissipate with little lateral migration across the face of the shock . if the assertion by @xcite that these knots are odd - even numerical instabilities is true , they can not survive long in the steadily thickening shocked layer at these densities . rather than condensing and fragmenting",
    ", the shell tends to expand back into the jet , crowding its rarefied interior with gas that shields its tip from incident radiation and collapsing it back into the face of the shock .",
    "the collapse of the jet back into a dimple imparts considerable vorticity to the shocked gas in the vicinity of the disturbance , as is evident in panel ( c ) .",
    "we find that atomic hydrogen cooling effectively quenches the shadow instability , but not before it significantly churns the face of the shock .",
    "the jet instability is far more violent when full nine - species primordial chemistry , the blackbody spectrum of the 100,000 k primordial star , and molecular hydrogen cooling are included , as we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : rwm_mnu ] . here",
    ", it is the higher post - front gas temperatures associated with multifrequency ionization of h and he that sustain and destabilize the jet . at 35,000 k",
    ", the high pressure of the ionized gas prevents the shocked shell ( @xmath50 10,000 k ) from expanding and backfilling the rarefied jet , so the dimple never heals or collapses back into the face of the shock .",
    "the role of h@xmath0 cooling is minimal .",
    "the thickness of the shell in this model is indistinguishable from that with atomic cooling only , but the persistence of some molecular hydrogen likely promotes some small - scale fragmentation of the shell .",
    "we observe no saturation of the jet and it continues to grow with time .",
    "maximum overdensities due to clumping of gas are approximately 10 in both runs .",
    "in @xmath9 4 it was shown that violent dynamical instabilities do not manifest in shocked shells cooled by atomic h only . at what metallicity do dynamical instabilities appear in d - type i - fronts in the absence of h@xmath0 cooling ?",
    "we performed a grid of calculations with dalgarno & mccray cooling in metallicities of 1 @xmath1 10@xmath63 z@xmath4 , 1 @xmath1 10@xmath2 z@xmath4 , 1 @xmath1 10@xmath3 z@xmath4 , 0.1 z@xmath4 , and 1.0 z@xmath4 to ascertain if there is threshold to instability growth .",
    "the problem setup is the same as in the three - dimensional r@xmath3 run described in @xmath9 [ 4.1 ] , again assuming an initial electron fraction of 1 @xmath1 10@xmath63 appropriate for z @xmath50 20 . at such low fractions",
    "the cooling in the gas is chiefly due to excitation of metals by collisions with neutral hydrogen ( see fig . 2 in @xcite ) . at solar metallicity",
    "these cooling rates lie approximately an order of magnitude below the dalgarno & mccray curve shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cool ] .",
    "our metallicities were chosen to survey cooling efficiencies between the very low purely atomic rates and quite large 1 z@xmath4 metal line curve .",
    "we apply a cooling cutoff temperature of 1000 k rather than the cmb temperature .",
    "this limits the thickness to which the shell can collapse so the metallicity at which instabilities appear is truly the threshold for their formation .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : metallicity ] the i - front and shock are shown at 125.5 kyr for our six choices of metallicity .",
    "we include in panel ( a ) the front in a zero - metallicity gas as a reference case in which no unstable modes arise .",
    "noticeable perturbations appear in the front in roughly equal numbers in gas enriched to 1 @xmath1 10@xmath63 z@xmath4 and 1 @xmath1 10@xmath2 z@xmath4 ( panels ( b ) and ( c ) , respectively ) ; those in panel ( c ) are slightly more pronounced but in neither case do they grow significantly with time or penetrate the shell to disrupt the shock .",
    "the agitation in the front does perturb the shock in the 1 @xmath1 10@xmath3 z@xmath4 gas , with visible hydrodynamical motions above and below the image plane .",
    "also , consolidation of initially short - wavelength modes into fewer larger - wavelength structures is evident , clearly demonstrating the evolution in d - type fronts predicted by @xcite .",
    "these features are even more pronounced in the 0.1 z@xmath4 case , and the instability completely deforms the shock in the 1.0 z@xmath4 gas .",
    "if one adopts deformation of the shock and wavelength evolution of the unstable modes as the criteria for instability formation , it appears that metallicities of @xmath50 1 @xmath1 10@xmath3 z@xmath4 are the threshold for perturbation growth in these densities .",
    "however , we note that primordial gas in relic h ii regions would be susceptible to ionization front instabilities at considerably lower metallicities because they are compensated by larger free electron abundances .",
    "our results indicate that this type of flow instability would operate even in marginally enriched protgalaxies and star - forming minihalos .",
    "the morphology of the instabilities at later times suggest that they might be efficient at driving turbulence in the shock , which could have important implications for the time scales of subsequent star formation in the region @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that instabilities readily erupt at solar metallicities even with the much lower initial electron fraction @xmath84 of 0.0001 than the @xmath84 = 0.01 value adopted in @xcite .",
    "while in general it is difficult to know what free electron abundances are present in a galactic molecular cloud , a reasonable assumption is that all the carbon in the gas is singly ionized by the uv background .",
    "this yields a lower bound for electron fractions in star forming regions in the galaxy today that is on the order of those applied in this grid of metallicities , confirming that i - front instabilities will be a general feature of those regions .",
    "instabilities readily form in primordial ionization fronts , even in the absence of metals . however , they emerge only when calculations couple multifrequency radiative transfer to gas phase primordial chemistry , which is crucial to capturing the formation of h@xmath0 that triggers dynamical instabilities in self - shielded shells or the high post - front gas temperatures that perpetuate shadow instabilities .",
    "we find that thin - shell modes can not develop in atomic h and he but that rayleigh - taylor instabilities are not ruled out .",
    "nevertheless , they do not appear on the time scales of uv breakout from the density profiles in our models , which roughly approximate those in cosmological halos .    dynamical instabilities in d - type fronts",
    "were probably common in centrally - concentrated structures capable of molecular hydrogen self - shielding , like cosmological minihalos at subparsec radii and molecular cores in primitive galaxies .",
    "however , shadow instabilities appearing earlier in r - type fronts and needing no h@xmath0 cooling may have pre - empted thin - shell instabilities in more evolved i - fronts",
    ". inhomogeneities endemic to all primordial structures made this instability ubiquitous , forming shocks and clumps that regulated the escape of ionizing uv photons and metals from the first luminous objects .",
    "one question that remains to be answered is how instabilities forming at subparsec radii deep in cosmological halos or early galaxies governed the final morphologies of h ii regions on kiloparsec scales .",
    "if clumping due to unstable modes was long - lived , uv breakout along adjacent lines of sight may have been significantly delayed , causing the formation of extended fingers of ionized gas into the early igm that resulted in serious departures from the classical `` butterfly '' appearance of many cosmological h ii regions @xcite .",
    "numerical models bridging the spatial scales between the young d - type front and final h ii region are now under development .",
    "ionization front instabilities in the accretion envelopes of the first stars may have allowed them to grow to much larger masses than predicted by analytical models of infall reversal @xcite .",
    "fingers of ionized gas elongating outward through the accretion shock might have channelled ionizing radiation out of the cloud that would otherwise have staunched infall .",
    "accretion could then continue downward in columns of neutral flow , allowing the star to bypass the final mass limits set by the cutoff models .",
    "the strength and longevity of i - front instabilities determined their impact on subsequent star formation .",
    "prominent extrusions from the front out into the halo or host galaxy might have created clumps of primordial gas prone to gravitational collapse by hd cooling in the relic h ii region , forming a new generation of stars without recourse to chemical enrichment .",
    "this scenario merits further study with high resolution methods , as it is uncertain if clumps could have collapsed outside the potential well of the dark matter halo . on the other hand , more saturated modes due to less efficient cooling and fragmentation of the shell",
    "may instead have provided turbulent support against condensation in larger cloud complexes within protogalaxies , suppressing rather than promoting star formation .",
    "clumping by instabilities may have determined the extent of the first metal bubbles @xcite in addition to modulating uv escape fractions and the final radii of h ii regions .",
    "mixing of metals with clumps may also have accelerated second generation star formation .",
    "efficiently cooled clumps would have collapsed to form stars on mass scales very different from their predecessors .",
    "accurate models of primordial h ii regions that include ionization front instabilities will establish the proper initial conditions for metal mixing in the next generation of early chemical enrichment studies .    although dynamical instabilities due to heavier elements appeared at metallicities of 0.001 - 0.01 at ionized fractions of 0.01 , they would have appeared in abundances an order of magnitude lower in the higher free electron fractions of fossil h ii regions .",
    "this is comparable to the metallicity associated with the transition from pop iii stars to less massive populations @xcite ; hence , instability formation , and its consequences , smoothly followed rollovers in initial mass functions ( imfs ) in the early universe .",
    "we neglect direct transport of recombination photons , which may limit the growth of unstable modes . reprocessed radiation emanating from within ionized extensions of gas may erode the sides of the fingers , photoevaporating overdensities in the troughs",
    ". this may not be an important effect in shadow instabilities since the interior of the jet is relatively rarefied , with low recombination emissivities .",
