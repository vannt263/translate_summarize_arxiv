    "we study the heavy traffic behavior of the queue length process in a shortest remaining processing time ( srpt ) queue .",
    "we consider a single server queue with renewal arrivals and independent and identically distributed processing times that are also independent of the arrival process .",
    "jobs are served in a nonidling fashion such that at each instant the job with the shortest remaining processing time is served at rate one .",
    "this is done with preemption so that if a job arrives for which the total processing time is smaller than that remaining of the job in service , the job in service is placed on hold and the arriving job enters service . therefore , in order to adequately track the state of the system , it is necessary to keep track of all remaining processing times of all jobs in the system .",
    "we do this using a measure valued process that at each time has a unit atom at the remaining processing time of each job in the system .",
    "this is introduced formally in section  [ sec : model ] .",
    "optimality of shortest remaining processing time , in the sense that it is the queue length minimizer over all nonidling service disciplines , has been known since the 1960s @xcite .",
    "one anticipates that this results at the expense of lengthy delays for jobs with large total processing times .",
    "hence , sojourn times are naturally of interest for srpt . for markovian arrivals ,",
    "the early work schrage and miller @xcite develops a formula for the mean response time in steady state with extended results available in schassberger @xcite and perera @xcite ; see schreiber @xcite for a survey . also see results in pavlov @xcite and pechinkin",
    "@xcite on steady state queue length distributions .",
    "recently , lin , wierman and zwart @xcite followed up on the work in @xcite by characterizing the asymptotic behavior of the steady state mean sojourn time as the traffic intensity approaches one for a large class of processing time distributions .",
    "interestingly , the rate at which the mean sojourn time tends to infinity depends on the tail behavior of the processing time distribution . results in this spirit were also an outcome of @xcite , where a fluid model ( formal functional law of large numbers limit ) was proposed and an associate weak convergence result ( functional law of large numbers result ) was stated and proved .",
    "there the rate at which a fluid analog of the sojourn time as a function of the initial processing time tends to infinity depends on the tail behavior of the processing distribution .",
    "other somewhat recent studies of srpt have focused on fairness ( e.g. , @xcite ) or tail behavior @xcite .",
    "here we focus on further developing existing diffusion limit results ( functional central limit theorems ) for srpt .",
    "the paper @xcite contains a diffusion limit theorem for the sequence of measure valued state descriptors under standard heavy traffic conditions and standard diffusion scaling . for limiting processing time distributions with bounded support",
    ", the main result in @xcite indicates that the limiting measure valued process is a single atom supported at the supremum of the support of the limiting processing time distribution for all time .",
    "the height of that atom varies randomly in time as determined by the limiting workload process .",
    "more specifically , under standard heavy traffic conditions , the sequence of conventionally diffusion scaled workload processes converges in distribution to a semi - martingale reflected brownian motion @xcite .",
    "the height of the atom for the measure valued diffusion limit is then given by the limiting workload process divided by the supremum of the support of the limiting processing time distribution . this is analogous to early results for strict priority queues where in the heavy traffic diffusion limit work piles up in the lowest priority class @xcite .",
    "the main result in  @xcite goes on to state that for limiting processing time distributions with unbounded support , the limiting measure valued process is identically equal to the zero measure .",
    "in particular , the limiting queue length process is identically equal to zero .",
    "such behavior had not been observed prior to this for other nonidling service disciplines .",
    "the limiting queue length process is typically recovered from the limiting workload process via multiplication by a positive constant , a phenomenon known as state space collapse ; see @xcite , for instance .",
    "the fact that the sequence of rescaled queue length processes is of lower order magnitude than the sequence of rescaled workload processes quantifies the extreme queue length minimizing nature of srpt .",
    "a natural follow - up question to the work in @xcite is whether or not there is an alternative scaling that can be employed to yield a nontrivial limit for this unconventionally rescaled queue length process . if such a limit exists , it would be of interest to describe how that limit is related to the limiting workload process that arises under standard diffusion scaling . here",
    "we identify such a nonstandard scaling for continuous processing time distributions with unbounded support for which the tails satisfy a rapid variation condition .",
    "the main theorem in this paper , theorem  [ thrm : main ] , specifies that the spatial scaling must be modified by multiplying by a certain inverse function related to the tails of the first moment of the processing time distribution .",
    "in particular , there is multiplicative correction factor that must be applied to standard diffusion scaling to obtain a nontrivial limit .",
    "the order of magnitude of that correction factor depends on the rate at which the tails of the first moment tend to zero . with this corrective scaling ,",
    "the limiting process is identically equal to the limiting workload process that arises under standard diffusion scaling .",
    "hence , with this corrective scaling factor , a generalized version of state space collapse holds .    the corrective scaling identified here",
    "was inspired by fluid limit results in @xcite .",
    "the order of magnitude agrees with that of the left edge of the support of fluid model solutions as time approaches infinity .",
    "this seems to be the first result in the queuing theory literature where the nature of the scaling depends on the tail behavior of the processing time distribution .",
    "in fact , we only know of one previous result @xcite that employs nonstandard scaling .",
    "the scaling in @xcite is a mixture of conventional fluid ( functional law of large numbers ) and conventional diffusion ( functional central limit theorem ) scaling .",
    "it is interesting to note that the result in theorem  [ thrm : main ] is consistent with the rapid variation case of @xcite , theorem  3 , as follows .",
    "theorem  3 in @xcite specifies an asymptotic formula for the mean sojourn time in steady state as the traffic intensity increases to one . by using the rate at which the traffic intensity approaches one for standard heavy traffic conditions [ see ( [ eq : param ] ) ] ,",
    "one can informally translate their asymptotic formula into one indexed by the sequence of systems here .",
    "this results in an asymptotic formula that has the same order of magnitude as the spatial scaling specified by theorem  [ thrm : main ] . of course",
    "the former is for the steady - state mean response time , and the latter is for the unconventionally rescaled queue length process .",
    "but , due to little s law , the queue length and response time should be of the same order of magnitude .    in general",
    ", the inverse function that produces the corrective scaling is not available in closed form .",
    "hence , the multiplicative constant contained within it is not immediately available .",
    "however , for weibull processing time distributions , explicit calculations can be done to separate the order of magnitude and multiplicative constant .",
    "the order of magnitude is determined by the shape parameter and the multiplicative constant is given by the scale parameter .",
    "this is stated precisely in corollary  [ cor : weibull ] , which provides an interesting illustration of the resulting generalize state space collapse .",
    "this raises the next natural question of what happens when the processing time distributions satisfy a regular variation condition .",
    "the work here does not address that case .",
    "the works @xcite and @xcite suggest that the same function might provide an appropriate corrective scaling .",
    "however , the proof of theorem  [ thrm : main ] does not generalize to that case .",
    "the slowly varying nature of the inverse function that specifies the corrective scaling factor plays an important role in the proof of theorem  [ thrm : main ] ; see ( [ eq : svrate ] ) and ( [ eq : rate ] ) .",
    "determining the behavior in the case of regular variation is work in progress .    in the next section ,",
    "we precisely define the model and associated measure valued state descriptor",
    ". then we specify the sequence of systems and associated asymptotic conditions that they must satisfy .",
    "this allows us to state the main result of the paper , theorem  [ thrm : main ] , and its corollary for weibull processing time distributions , corollary  [ cor : weibull ] .",

    ", we refer to the @xmath67th job to arrive to the system as job @xmath67 , or the @xmath67th job .",

    "rate of convergence conditions such as this and their implications are discussed more fully in @xcite , section  2.3.1 . here",
    "we note that ( [ eq : svrate ] ) is not satisfied by all slowly varying functions .",

    "however , it does hold for many processing distributions , including weibull processing time distributions .",
    "that weibull processing time distributions satisfy ( [ eq : svrate ] ) is demonstrated in section  [ sec : main ] .",
    "the reason for assuming ( [ eq : svrate ] ) is that by @xcite , theorem  2.3.3 ( originally stated in  @xcite ) , it follows that for all @xmath84 , @xmath85 recall that @xmath77 is slowly varying so that @xmath86 for all @xmath53 .",

    "let @xmath97 , which is a random variable taking values in @xmath13 .",
    "then @xmath98 corresponds to the total work ( measured in units of processing time ) in the system at time zero .",

    "in particular , the server does not idle if there are jobs in the system . at any given instance",

    "one can view theorem  [ thrm : main ] as a generalized state space collapse result with a multiplicative lifting factor of one ; that is , the heavy traffic limit of the unconventionally rescaled queue length process is one times the heavy traffic limit of the conventionally rescaled workload process .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ thrm : main ] given in section  [ sec : proof ] provides insight into how this phenomenon manifests itself .",
