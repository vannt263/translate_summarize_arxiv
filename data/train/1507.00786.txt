    "stationary state properties and dynamics of ultracold atoms in a double - well ( dw ) potential have attracted considerable attention over the past few decades @xcite . as a powerful building block model , the double well plays a key role in revealing numerous interesting phenomena of quantum many - body and few - body systems due to the experimental accessibility and precise controllability . actually , many intriguing properties have been predicted theoretically and some observed experimentally in  bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) or ultracold fermionic atoms in a dw potential , ranging from the josephson effect and quantum self - trapping smerzi , milburn , pu , albiez , ananikian , wen1,shchesnovich , adhikari , juliadiaz1,gillet , gati , edmonds , fragmentation of a bec @xcite , entangled clusters ywu and noon - like states @xcite of condensed bosons , quantum chaos @xcite , hidden vortices @xcite and vortex superpositions @xcite , and spin correlation @xcite to two - particle analog of a charge - density - wave state @xcite , etc .",
    "of particular interest is the quantum tunneling dynamics in a dw bec because it represents one of the most surprising and paradigmatic effects in quantum mechanics .",
    "although tunneling is a fundamental phenomenon in wave dynamics ( for instance , the dynamics of atomic matter waves and the classical dynamics of optical waves ) @xcite , the quantum tunneling of ultracold bosonic atoms through a potential barrier between two wells provides a direct manifestation of quantum phase coherence .",
    "recently , a correlated quantum tunneling was observed in ref .",
    "@xcite and a relevant theoretical analysis was presented by means of two - body dynamics @xcite .",
    "further study demonstrates that correlated tunneling is principally resulted from pair tunneling , which involves the superexchange interactions between particles on neighboring wells @xcite .",
    "most recently , spontaneous symmetry breaking and effective ground state in a dw bec with pair tunneling are discussed in ref .",
    "these theoretical investigations zollner , liang , zhu  concerning to the pair tunneling are confined to the regime of repulsive interatomic interactions .",
    "in addition , the analyses in refs .",
    "@xcite  are illustrated with a two - atom or few - body system .",
    "however , the usual realistic ultracold atomic gases in experiments should be many - body systems .",
    "in fact , strong many - body effect may basically alter the tunneling configuration of the dw system .",
    "on the other hand , the research on neutral atoms in synthetic gauge fields has become an active new subject in the filed of cold atom physics dalibard .",
    "the artificial gauge potentials constitute novel tools for exploring the properties of ultracold atoms , which usually occur in the field of condensed matter physics .",
    "recently , spielman s group experimentally realized a peierls substitution for ultracold neutral atoms in an artificial lattice potential @xcite , where the peierls phase can be controlled precisely .",
    "the effective vector gauge potential is characterized by a complex tunneling parameter @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the so - called peierls phase gained by an atom tunneling from site @xmath2 to @xmath3 .",
    "in addition , the peierls phase may also be created in a shaken optical lattice @xcite or a spin - dependent optical lattice @xcite . in these studies ,",
    "the equilibrium states of the many - body system can be well described .",
    "however , little is known about the quantum quench dynamics of a system far from equilibrium , especially for the quantum quenches of the hamiltonian caused by a sudden change of the peierls phase . from a fundamental viewpoint ,",
    "the quantum quench dynamics of cold atom systems far from equilibrium is very interesting because it can reveal rich properties of the many - body system beyond ground state .",
    "for instance , _ zitterbewegung _ oscillation and dynamical topological phases have been observed most recently in a quenched spin - orbit - coupled ( soc ) bec qu and a quenched soc degenerate fermi gas @xcite , respectively .    in this work",
    "we investigate the stationary state properties of a bec in a dw potential with pair tunneling and the quantum dynamics of the dw system with a maximal initial population difference as well as the quench dynamics of the system by abruptly changing the peierls phase .",
    "although the problems of bosons in a dw potential can be solved under certain conditions by several semi - classical analytical approximations , such as mean - field theory smerzi , milburn , ananikian , variational approach to many - body ground state @xcite , phase - space analysis of many - body bosons juliadiaz1,mahmud and wkb approach @xcite , these semi - classical treatments are usually too complicated and redundant in understanding the physical essence of the problems .",
    "in particular , the correlated tunneling observed in ref .",
    "@xcite can not be described by the standard bose - hubbard ( bh ) hamiltonian @xcite based on the hard - core interaction under the semi - classical approximations .",
    "here we adopt a tractable full quantum - mechanical scheme to tackle the present problem .",
    "the main features are summarized as follows .",
    "first , strong pair tunneling can make the eigenstates of the system evolves from delocalized states to schrdinger cat - like states and quantum self - trapping states and vice versa , depending on the many - body interactions .",
    "second , for the case of relatively weak repulsive interactions strong pair tunneling sustains a quantum self - trapping , but for the case of large repulsive interactions the strong pair tunneling tends to destroy the self - trapping . on the other hand , for attractive interatomic interactions",
    "the strong pair tunneling tends to eliminate the josephson oscillation and quantum self - trapping irrespective of the interaction strength .",
    "finally , once the dw system is quenched , the population difference shows evident oscillation behaviors for most cases .",
    "the maximum oscillation amplitude is directly relevant to the value of the peierls phase .",
    "these interesting features are markedly different from the usual stationary state structures and dynamical behaviors of a bec in a dw potential , which allows to be observed and tested under current experimental technique conditions .",

    "the degeneracy of each pair in the excited states can be eliminated by artificially introducing a small tilt of the double well .",
    "we show that for a repulsive interatomic interaction @xmath10 above a critical value the left - right symmetry of the high - lying states is broken such that the density profile develops an evident population imbalance and occupies mainly one region of the fock space .",
    "consequently , the highest excited state spontaneously acquires a large population imbalance , which means the highest - lying state evolves from a delocalized state to a schrdinger cat - like state and eventually to a quantum self - trapping state due to the symmetry breaking .",
    "the above analysis can explain why there is a large dropwell of the density profiles in figure 1(a2 ) .",
    "when the repulsive interaction @xmath10 is sufficiently strong , the density profiles become almost two cross line segments [ figure 1(a3 ) ] . in this situation ,",
    "most energy eigenstates are pair quasi - degenerate and non - extended ( cat - like or highly localized ) .",
    "physically , this point can be understood because the sufficiently strong repulsive interaction is equivalent to a very high central barrier of the dw potential , where the particle tunneling between the two wells is highly suppressed and the coherence between the two sites is lost . for the case of ground state ,",
    "a well - known paradigm is the mott insulator phase with a commensurating filling in a optical lattice @xcite .",
    "note that the case of attractive interactions is similar to that of the repulsive interactions , but the role played by the highest - lying excited state is now replaced by the ground state of the hamiltonian ( [ reducedhamiltonian ] ) and the low - lying eigenstates exhibit two - fold degeneracy [ see figure 3(b ) ] .    , where @xmath57 , and the ordinal number of the energy eigenstate @xmath53 .",

    "@xmath67 and @xmath68.,width=321 ]    in the meantime , we find that the density profiles of the stationary states are significantly influenced by the pair tunneling and the tilt parameter of the dw potential . for weak repulsive interaction as well as weak pair tunneling ,",
    "the density distributions are similar to those in figure 1(a1 ) except for a further broading in the upper region [ figure 1(b1 ) ] . however , for large repulsive interaction , pair tunneling exhibits distinct  effect on the density profiles , as shown in figures 1(b2 ) and 1(b3 ) .",
    "essentially , the single - particle josephson tunneling is suppressed for strong repulsion and the pair tunneling gradually becomes dominant with continuously increasing interactions .",
    "as mentioned above , the coupling constant @xmath69 is in direct proportion to the pair tunneling . in the case of @xmath70 and @xmath71 , the term of @xmath72 in equation ( [ reducedhamiltonian ] )",
    "actually suppresses the interwell hoping .",
    "thus the pair tunneling tends to make the eigenstates more localized in comparison with the case of @xmath70 and @xmath55 , which can be seen in figure 1(b2 ) .",

    "consequently , for the case of superstrong interaction @xmath74 , the pair tunneling @xmath75 does not make the eigenstates further localized but more extended instead [ see figure 1(b3 ) ] .",
    "the effect of the bias of the double well on the density profiles is shown in figures 1(c1)-1(c3 ) .",
    "when @xmath76 and @xmath77 , the density profiles of the low - lying states display a shift towards the left side and those of the high - lying states keep only the right branch [ figure 1(c1 ) ] due to the symmetry breaking of the left - right wells , while the case is reversed when @xmath78 and @xmath77 [ figure 1(c2 ) ] . furthermore , the combining effect of attractive interaction and pair tunneling as well as the bias of the dw potential is demonstrated in figure 1(c3 ) .     for typical degenerate eigenstate pairs in figure 1(a2 ) .",

    "it is shown that for strong repulsive interaction @xmath80 and zero pair tunneling the lowest seven eigenstates are non - degenerate and pair degeneracy occurs from the eighth eigenstate [ figure 3(a ) ] . with the increasing of @xmath81 ( i.e. , with the increasing of pair tunneling ) below a critical value @xmath82 the energy gap between two nearest - neighbor non - degenerate eigenstates decreases remarkably . however , with the further increase of @xmath81 the energy levels almost keep constant and exhibit a characteristic of degeneracy or quasi - degeneracy . by contrast , for attractive interaction the lowest ten eigenstates are pair degeneracy ( or quasi - degeneracy ) irrespective of the pair tunneling strength , where the relations between @xmath83 and @xmath81 are similar to those in figure 3(a ) .",
    "physically , the degeneracy or quasi - degeneracy of the energy levels are resulted from the interatomic interactions ( including the on - site two - body interaction , the inter - well particle interaction , and the pair tunneling ) . according to the definition of the tunneling ratio @xmath81",

    "this can be understood in terms of the expressions of the hamiltonian ( [ stationaryhamiltonian ] ) and the fock states ( fockstate ) .",

    "we numerically solve the coupled equations ( [ c1evolution])-([cn1evolution ] ) using the fourth - order runge - kutta method .",
    "the most important physical quantity characterizing the tunneling dynamics and quantum fluctuations of the dw system is the population difference . for the case of non - interacting limit and symmetric dw potential ,",

    "the oscillation is somewhat erratic as shown in figures 7(a1 ) and 7(a2 ) .",
    "physically , particle number fluctuations can automatically admix the excited states of the system due to the many - body interactions .",
    "thus the quench caused by the sudden change of the peierls phase generates various elementary excitations with different frequencies .",
    "the similar feature is also found in the case of few - bosons dynamics in a double well @xcite . with the time evolution",
    ", the population difference finally restores to its initial value @xmath129 . from figures 7(a1 ) and 7(a2 ) , one can see that when the peierls phase @xmath1 ( @xmath115 ) get larger the maximum value of the oscillation amplitudes becomes larger , which is similar to the case of repulsive interactions .",
    "in addition , we find that the population difference keeps zero in the case of @xmath117 as shown in figure 7(a3 ) .",
    "this point can be understood because for the weak attractive interaction of @xmath128 the ground state of the dw system is still symmetric , which is similar to the case of repulsive interactions . for strong attractive interaction and @xmath18 , the ground sate of the dw system",
    "is a quantum self - trapping state with a large population difference , i.e. , the atoms are self trapped in a single trap ( e.g. , the right trap ) of the dw potential .",
    "once the hamiltonian is quenched due to the sudden change of the peierls phase @xmath1 , the oscillation gradually decays and the population difference eventually resumes its original value @xmath130 , which can be seen in figures 7(b1)-7(b3 ) . in the case of @xmath131 , a larger peierls phase @xmath91 implies a higher oscillation amplitude .",

    "in summary , we have applied a full quantum - mechanical procedure to investigate the properties of the stationary states of becs in a dw potential and the quantum dynamics of the system with a maximum initial population difference . at the same time , the quantum quench dynamics of the system is studied by suddenly changing the peierls phase of the dw potential .",
    "we show that the pair tunneling influences significantly the density profiles and energy spectrums of the stationary states especially for the cases of medium or strong interatomic interactions . with the increase of the ratio between the pair tunneling strength and the sing - particle tunneling strength ,",
    "the eigenstates of the hamiltonian become pair degenerate and the corresponding energy levels ultimately keep almost constant .",
    "in addition , it is shown that in the case of weak repulsion the strong pair tunneling sustains a quantum self - trapping for the quantum dynamics of the dw system with a maximum initial population difference while in the case of large repulsion the strong pair tunneling tends to destroy the self - trapping effect .",
    "by contrast , for the case of attractive interactions the strong pair tunneling tends to eliminate the josephson oscillations and the quantum self - trapping irrespective of the interaction strength .",
    "moreover , when the dw system is quenched , the population difference shows evident oscillation behaviors for most cases .",
    "the maximum amplitude of the oscillation is directly relevant to the value of the peierls phase .",
    "these properties are remarkably different from those in a conventional dw bec with no pair tunneling , which allows to be observed and tested in the future experiments .",
