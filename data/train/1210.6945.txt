    "it spans the range between the kinematical configuration of two collimated back - to - back jets ( dijet limit ) and a perfectly spherical final state .",

    "the resummed cross section is then matched to the fixed - order result so as to obtain a prediction holding all over the kinematical range spanned by the thrust .",
