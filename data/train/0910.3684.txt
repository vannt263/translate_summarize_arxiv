    "the present day space and velocity distributions of galactic isolated old neutron stars ( ns ) , are the subject of many studies . among the reasons for deriving the positional and kinematical properties of isolated old nss was the suggestion that gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) may originate from galactic nss ( e.g. , mazets et al .",
    "this was refuted by the homogeneous sky distribution of grbs ( e.g. , meegan et al . 1992 ) , and later on by the discovery of their cosmic origin ( e.g. , metzger et al .",
    "1997 ; van paradijs et al . 1997 ) .    another exciting possibility , that re - ignited these efforts , was to detect isolated old nss in soft x - ray radiation that may be emitted as they slowly accrete matter from the interstellar medium ( ism ; ostriker , rees & silk 1970 ; shvartsman 1971 ) .",
    "treves & colpi ( 1991 ) , and blaes & madau ( 1993 ) predicted that @xmath5@xmath6 isolated old ns accreting from the ism would be detected by the _",
    "position sensitive proportional counters ( pspc ) all sky survey ( voges et al .",
    "although intensive searches for these objects were carried out ( e.g. , motch et al .",
    "1997 ; maoz , ofek , & shemi 1997 ; haberl , motch , & pietsch 1998 ; rutledge et al . 2003 ; ageros et al . 2006 ) , only a handful of candidates were found . however , these are presumably young cooling nss , rather than old nss whose luminosity is dominated by accretion from the ism ( e.g. , neuhuser & trmper 1999 ; popov et al .",
    "2000 ; treves et al .",
    "2001 ) . apparently , the reasons for the rareness of these objects in the _ rosat _ source catalog is that their typical velocities were underestimated by earlier studies ( i.e. , narayan & ostriker 1990 ) .",
    "it is also possible that their accretion rate is below the bondi - hoyle rate ( e.g. , colpi et al .",
    "1998 ; perna et al . 2003 ; toropina et al . 2001 , 2003 , 2005",
    "; see however arons & lea 1976,1980 ) , or that these nss are in an ejection stage ( e.g. , colpi et al .",
    "1998 ; livio et al . 1998 ; popov & prokhorov 2000 ) .    during the last several years , new classes of radio transients were found ( e.g. , bower et al . 2007 ; matsumura et al . 2007 ; niinuma et al . 2007 ;",
    "kida et al .",
    "2008 ; see also levinson et al . 2002 ; gal - yam et al .",
    "bower et al . (",
    "2007 ) found several examples of these transients in a single small field of view , and showed that they have time scales above 20min but below seven days , and they lack any quiescent x - ray , visible - light , near - infrared ( ir ) , and radio counterparts .",
    "recently , ofek et al . (",
    "2009 ) suggested that these transient events may be associated with galactic isolated old nss .",
    "however , testing this hypothesis requires knowledge of the nss space distribution .",
    "there are two approaches in the literature for calculating the theoretical space and velocity distributions of old nss .",
    "paczynski ( 1990 ) , hartmann , woosley , & epstein ( 1990 ) , blaes & rajagopal ( 1991 ) , blaes & madau ( 1993 ) , and posselt et al .",
    "( 2008 ) carried out monte - carlo simulations of ns orbits .",
    "in such simulations , the positions and velocities of ns at birth are integrated assuming some non - evolving galactic potential .",
    "a second approach is to use some sort of semi - analytic approximation in order to estimate the `` final '' ns space and velocity distributions .",
    "frei , huang , & paczynski ( 1992 ) calculated the final vertical density and velocity distributions of nss , assuming that the gravitational potential is a function only of the height , @xmath7 , above the galactic plane . using the epicyclic approximation , blaes & rajagopal ( 1991 ) developed a technique that allows calculation of the full three dimensional velocity distribution of nss .",
    "however , they showed that this method is not adequate for fast moving objects , which constitute the majority of the ns population .",
    "blaes & madau ( 1993 ) used the thin - disk approximation to calculate the space and velocity distributions of nss . in this prescription , the radial motion of nss are controlled by the galactic potential in the galactic disk , regardless of the vertical height , @xmath7 , of the ns above / below the galactic plane .",
    "finally , another solution was presented by prokhorov & postnov ( 1994 ) , who assume that the ergodic hypothesis is correct ( see discussion in binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "madau & blaes ( 1994 ) noted that all these approaches neglect dynamical heating of nss due to encounters with giant molecular clouds , spiral arms , and stellar `` collisions '' ( e.g. , kamahori & fujimoto 1986 , 1987 ; barbanis & woltjer 1967 ; carlberg & sellwood 1985 ; jenkins & binney 1990 ) .",
    "they crudely estimated the order of magnitude of this effect by applying the force - free diffusion equation to the vertical height , @xmath7 , and ns speed distributions .",
    "they found that , at the solar neighborhood , dynamical heating may decrease the local density of nss by a factor of @xmath8 relative to a non - heated population .",
    "in this paper i present the results of monte - carlo orbital simulations of galactic nss .",
    "these simulations improve upon past efforts ( e.g. , paczynski 1990 ; hartmann , epstein , & woosley 1990 , blaes & rajagopal 1991 ; blaes & madau 1993 ; popov et al . 2005 ; and posselt et al .",
    "2008 ) in several aspects .",
    "first , i use up - to - date space and velocity distributions of nss at birth from arzoumanian et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and faucher - gigure & kaspi ( 2006 ) .",
    "second , i assume a birth rate of nss along the galaxy life time , instead of assuming that all the nss were born about 10  gyr ago .",
    "third , i generate a large sample of simulated nss , which is about one to two orders of magnitude larger than those presented by previous efforts .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : in  [ sec : modeling ] i present the model ingredients for the monte - carlo simulations . in ",
    "[ sec : dynheat ] i discuss dynamical heating and show that it can be neglected .",
    "the monte - carlo simulations are described in  [ sec : mc ] , and the catalogue of simulated nss are presented in  [ sec : cat ] .",
    "the results of these simulations are presented in  [ sec : nsres ] , and in  [ sec : disc ] i summarize the results and compare them with some of the previous efforts .",
    "in the following subsections , i present the ingredients of the monte - carlo simulations .",
    "these are : nss birth rate (  [ sec : nsbirthrate ] ) ; space and velocity distributions of nss at birth (  [ sec : nsbirthdist ] ) ; and the galactic potential (  [ sec : galpot ] ) .      the stellar population in the milky way is composed of at least two major components : a bulge and a disk .",
    "i therefore , simulate two populations of nss . a galactic disk - born population and a galactic bulge population .",
    "for the galactic - disk nss , i assume a continuous constant formation rate in the past 12gyr .",
    "this assumption is motivated by the analysis of rocha - pinto et al .",
    "( 2000 ) that did  not find any major trends in the star formation rate in the disk of our galaxy .",
    "i assume that the galactic - bulge nss were born in a single burst 12  gyr ago ( ferreras , wyse , & silk 2003 ; ballero et al .",
    "2007 ; minniti & zoccali 2008 ) .",
    "as i discuss in this section , the simulations presented here consist of @xmath9 disk - born nss and @xmath10 bulge - born nss .",
    "the actual ratio of disk to bulge nss is unknown and may be significantly different than the one assumed here .",
    "therefore , in the resulting catalogue (  [ sec : cat ] ) i specify the origin of each simulated ns and present the results also for each population separately .    the total number of nss in the milky way is constrained by the chemical composition of the galaxy .",
    "specifically , the iron content of the galaxy implies that the total number of core collapse supernovae ( sne ; and therefore nss ) that exploded in the milky way is about @xmath1 ( arnett , schramm , & truran 1989 ) .",
    "however , the star formation rate in the galactic disk was approximately constant during the last @xmath11gyr ( rocha - pinto et al .",
    "2000 ; see also noh & scalo 1990 ) . therefore , with the current ns birth rate of up to one in 30  years ( e.g. , diehl et al . 2006 ) , one expects that there will be @xmath12 disk - born nss in our galaxy .",
    "the predictions based on the sn rate ( @xmath12 ) and the chemical evolution ( @xmath13 ) are therefore inconsistent .",
    "ways around this problem include uncertainty in the sn rate ( e.g. , arnett et al .",
    "1989 ) , and difficulty in estimating the star formation history of our galaxy ( keane & kramer 2008 ) . another viable resolution of this discrepancy is that the galactic bulge had a higher star formation rate at earlier times .",
    "the galactic bulge contains a considerable number of stars that were born , apparently , in a @xmath14gyr - long , burst about 12gyr ago ( ferreras , wyse , & silk 2003 ; ballero et al .",
    "2007 ; minniti & zoccali 2008 ) .",
    "i therefore , assume here that in addition to the disk - born nss there are up to @xmath15 nss that were formed in the galactic bulge about 12gyr ago .",
    "this number was selected such that the total number of nss in the galaxy is @xmath1 .",
    "i note that the galactic bulge contains only about 20% of the galactic stars ( e.g. , klypin et al .",
    "2002 ) . however , ballero et al .",
    "( 2007 ) argued that the initial mass function , @xmath16 , of the bulge is skewed toward high masses , with @xmath17 , the power - law index in the stellar mass function ( @xmath18 ; e.g. , salpeter 1955 ) , being @xmath19 .",
    "assuming that stars with masses exceeding 8m@xmath20 produce nss within a relatively short time after their birth , this suggests that the number of nss born in the galactic bulge is a few times larger than the number of nss born in the galactic disk , per unit stellar mass .",
    "therefore , the assumption that the majority of nss were born in the galactic bulge is in rough agreement with the expected fraction of high mass ( @xmath21m@xmath20 ) stars in the bulge , relative to the disk .",
    "nevertheless , as stated before , the ratio between the numbers of bulge - born to disk - born nss is uncertain .",
    "the simulations presented here cover a wide range of possibilities regarding birth place and time scenarios .      following , paczynski ( 1990 )",
    ", i adopt a radial birth probability distribution , @xmath22 , which follows the exponential stellar disk : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the distance from the galactic center projected on the galactic plane , @xmath25kpc is the exponential disk scale length , and @xmath26 is the normalization given by : @xmath27^{-1 } , \\label{expdisknorm}\\ ] ] where @xmath28kpc , is the disk truncation radius .",
    "yusifov & kk ( 2004 ) estimated the radial distribution ( measured from the galactic center ) of galactic pulsars , and found it to be more concentrated than predicted by the paczynski ( 1990 ) distribution .",
    "however , i note that the supernova remnant galactic radial distribution is in good agreement with the paczynski ( 1990 ) model .    for the ns bulge population",
    "i assume that the space distribution at birth has the same functional form and parameters as the ns disk population , but with @xmath29kpc in eqs .",
    "[ expdisk ] and [ expdisknorm ] .    for the initial velocity probability distribution ,",

    "both models are consistent with the observed velocity distribution of young pulsars .",
    "one is a bimodal velocity distribution composed of two gaussians found by arzoumanian et al .",

    "i note that drawing the velocity components of simulated nss directly from eq .",
