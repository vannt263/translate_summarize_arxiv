    "the momentum of a spinon has the range @xmath110 and its energy is @xmath111 the momentum and energy of an eigenstate of @xmath27 relative to the ground state are the sum of the momenta and energies of the individual spinons building up the state .",

    "this rule is approximately valid for the heisenberg model and exact for the haldane - shastry model .",
    "but by far not all transition matrix elements obeying this rule are large .",
    "if two states differ in spinon number by 0 or 2 , their energy difference may be much larger than @xmath118 and in that case the matrix element is always small .",
    "this has been observed in ref . and confirmed by us for larger systems .",
    "the dominant ground - state matrix elements for magnetic field @xmath119 with spin @xmath120 come from two parameter continua of states which are related to the ground state by the simplest hole excitations in @xmath108 space ( the classes swc1 and swc2 defined in ref . for longitudinal correlations ) , whereas the dimensions of the continua defined by @xmath121 are @xmath122 respectively .",
    "that means that only a small subset of all transitions with @xmath121 contributes substantially .    in the following",
    "we shall describe the nature of the excitations relevant for @xmath123 .",

    "the order of magnitude of suppression of the states lying outside of these limits can be read off from fig.[fig2 ] for low @xmath8 and from fig.[figyy ] for high @xmath8 .",
    "we reached this conclusion by    \\1 .",
    "a detailed examination of a set of selected states like those from the @xmath126 two - spinon continuum degenerate in energy with the @xmath109 two - spinon continuum and also higher class - c states with @xmath127 . in all these cases we found excitations with @xmath128 and @xmath129 to be dominant .",

    "not a single one was found .",
    "the selection rules found for @xmath46 imply that only class - c states are important : as ground states for given external magnetic field and as excited states .",
    "therefore it is interesting to assess the role of class - c states for @xmath104 too .",
    "we computed for the @xmath33-model for @xmath130 and 16 the energies of all class - c states using the bethe ansatz . to describe the results we introduce an additional label @xmath75 in the symbol for a state @xmath131 where @xmath75 indicates the class to which the state belongs : a class - c state and all elements of its spin multiplet have @xmath132 , a bound state ( see appendix ) has @xmath133 .",

    "it is therefore interesting to find out whether the spin dynamics is significantly changed when additional interactions are introduced . in fig.[fig3 ] we compare @xmath156 for two @xmath75 values .",

    "this is easily interpreted by observing that the finite - size effects are due to correlations connecting the sites @xmath221 and @xmath222 `` the wrong way round '' , i.e. over a distance @xmath223 instead of n. the ( roughly ) linear growth with @xmath220 of the time range affected by finite - size effects is consistent with ballistic propagation of the correlations .",
