    "type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) are the best known cosmological distance indicators at high redshifts .",
    "their use led to the discovery of the currently accelerating expansion of the universe ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "these sne are thought to occur when a white dwarf made of carbon and oxygen accretes sufficient mass to trigger a thermonuclear explosion .",
    "the explosion could happen via accretion from a companion star ( single degenerate ( sd ) channel ) or via merging of two white dwarfs ( double - degenerate ( dd ) channel ) .",
    "therefore , a companion star will survive the explosion only in the sd channel ( see these reviews @xcite , for further information ) .",
    "both channels might contribute to the production of type - ia supernovae but the relative proportions of their contributions remain unclear .",
    "one way to investigate type - ia sne is by performing direct survey of the field of historical events  @xcite .",
    "depending on the date of the sn explosion and the distance to the sn remnant , we are able to define the region where to find the possible companion star , close to the geometrical center of the sn remnant  @xcite .",
    "there are a few known historical galactic type - ia supernova events : sn 1572 ( tycho brahe supernova ) , sn 1006 , sn 1604 ( kepler supernova ) , and three new recently identified type - ia supernova remnants : sn 185 ( rcw86 ) , g299.2 - 2.9 and g272.2 - 3.2 .",
    "our group have been investigating these galactic historical snia , trying to search for companion stars of progenitors of historical galactic type - ia sne with the aim of clarifying the origin of these cosmological candles .",
    "we present here the results we have got in two of them , sn 1572 and sn 1006 .",
    "ruiz - lapuente et al .",
    "@xcite investigated the type - ia sn 1572 and found one promising candidate ( called tycho g ) to be the surviving companion of the progenitor of sn 1572 remnant , thus the origin of tycho s supernova remnant ( snr ) might be attributed to the sd channel . on the other hand , for instance ,",
    "the absence of any ex - companion in the supernova remnant snr 0509@xmath067.5 , in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , down to very faint magnitudes , strongly suggests that the sn explosion there was produced by a dd system .",
    "gonzlez hernndez et al .",
    "@xcite studied the star tycho g and derived its stellar parameters and chemical abundances , using hires@10m - kecki high - resolution spectra . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we show a re - determination of the ni abundance in tycho g compared with those of similar stars of the galactic thin and thick disk . a slightly ni enhancement is seen in tycho g ( see @xcite ) , which may suggest ni pollution from tycho sn 1572 ejecta .",
    "we have been also improved our previous proper motion determination of tycho g together with many other stars in the tycho sn field using images from hst programmes go-9729 , go-10098 and go-12469 ( pi : ruiz - lapuente ) , which span about 8 yr . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we compare the proper motion ( pm ) of tycho g , perpendicular to the galactic plane , together with those of other stars of the sn 1572 field , in comparison with the distribution of pms predicted by the besanon model of the galaxy @xcite .",

    "[ fig1 ] , and thus possibly the only viable candidate to be the surviving companion of sn 1572  @xcite .",

    "we inspect the 2mass photometry catalogue and use the irfm method ( see @xcite ) to derive effective temperatures of the additional candidates , with the aim of identifying those at the distance of the sn 1006 remnant .",

    "hydrodynamical simulations suggest that even if the pre - sn companion is main - sequence solar - mass star , about 1000 yr after the strong impact of the snia ejecta , the star does not have enough time to become dimmer than the sun .",
    "however , di stefano , voss and claeys ( @xcite ) have suggested that , by the time that the exploding white dwarf has reached the critical mass for explosion ( within the single degenerate scneario ) , the companion ( donor ) might have become a wd .",
