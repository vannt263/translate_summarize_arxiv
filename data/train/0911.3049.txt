    "high resolution observations show strong outflows and jets in black hole accreting systems , both in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) or quasars ( begelman et al . 1984 ; mirabel 2003 ) and microquasars ( ss433 , grs  1915 + 105 ) [ margon 1984 ; mirabel & rodriguez 1994 , 1998 ] .",
    "extragalactic radio sources show evidence of strong jets in the vicinity of spinning black holes ( meier et al .",
    "2001 ; meier 2002 ) .",
    "outflows are also observed in neutron star low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) ( fender et al . 2004 ; migliari & fender , 2006 ) and also in young stellar objects ( mundt 1985 ) .",
    "it has been argued ( ghosh & mukhopadhyay 2009 ; ghosh et al .",
    "2010 ; hereinafter gm09 , g10 respectively , and references therein ) that outflows and jets are more prone to emanate from strong advective accretion flows ; the said paradigm is more susceptible for super - eddington and sub - eddington accretion flows . however , the exact ( global if any ) mechanism of formation of the jet , its collimation , acceleration , composition from the accretion powered systems still remain inconclusive .",
    "extensive works have been pursued on the origin of outflow / jet , since the pioneering work of blandford & payne ( 1982 ) ( e.g. pudritz & norman 1986 ; contopoulos 1995 ; ostriker 1997 ) , where the authors used a self - similar approach to demonstrate that the poloidal component of the magnetic field can be seemingly used to launch outflowing matter from the disk . the formation of the jet is directly related to the efficacy of extraction of angular momentum and energy from the accretion disk .",
    "physical understanding of the hydromagnetic outflows from disks has been developed from magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations ( shibata & uchida 1986 ; ustyogova et al .",
    "1999 ; de villiers et al . 2005 ; hawley & krolik 2006 ) both in non - relativistic as well as in relativistic regimes , mostly in the keplerian paradigm .",
    "however , the large lorentz factors as well as faraday rotation measures suggest that the observed vlbi jets in quasars and active galaxies are in the poynting flux regime ( homan et al . 2001 ; lyutikov 2006 ) . on the other front",
    ", strong radiation pressure can serve as a different mechanism to effuse outflows / jets .",
    "this is likely to occur when the accretion rate is super - eddington or super - critical ( fabrika 2004 ; begelman et al .",
    "2006 ; gm09,g10 and references therein ) and the accretion disk is precisely `` radiation trapped '' as in ultra - luminous x - ray ( ulx ) sources . it has been confirmed by radiation hydrodynamic simulation at super - critical accretion rate ( okuda et al . 2009 ) as well to explain luminosity and mass outflow rate of relativistic outflows from ss433 .",
    "the under - luminous accreting sources , having high sub - critical accretion flow , were explained by an advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) model ( narayan & yi 1994 ) .",
    "the promising outcome of this model lies in the large positive value of the bernoulli parameter because of the small radiative energy loss .",
    "it leads to conceive that the gas in the inflowing disk is susceptible to escape , leading to strong unbounded flows in the form of outflows and jets .",
    "this also signifies that even in the absence of magnetic field and radiation pressure , outflows are plausible from strongly advective accretion flow if the system is allowed to perturb . nevertheless , the definitive understanding of the origin of outflows / jets is sill unknown .",
    "it remains one of the most compelling problems in high energy astrophysics .",
    "whatever might be the reason for the origin of outflow and then jet from the disk , one aspect is however definite that strong outflows producing relativistic jets are powered by extreme gravity .",
    "although seems paradoxical , the strength and the length scale of observed astrophysical jets vary directly with the strength of the central gravitating potential .",
    "observationally , it is evident that strong outflows and relativistic jets are more powerful in observed agns and quasars , harboring supermassive black holes , compared to that in black hole x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) .",
    "in addition , the jets observed in agns and quasars have greater length scale compared to that seen in stellar mass black hole systems .",
    "one of the most important signatures of relativistic gravitation is the spin of the central object .",
    "it is presumably believed that the spin ( practically specific angular momentum ) of the neutron star is less than that of a black hole , and thus the observed jet from black holes is much stronger and powerful than that of neutron star sources . in",
    "early , blandford & znajek ( 1977 ) demonstrated that if there is a magnetic field associated with the black hole due to threading of magnetic field lines from the disk and the angular momentum of the kerr black hole is large enough , then the energy and the angular momentum can be extracted from the underlying black hole by a purely electromagnetic mechanism , which can thus be expected to power the jet in an agn .",
    "these imply that the spin might play a significant role in powering jets , both in microquasars and in agns , rather , it can act as a fundamental parameter in an accretion powered system .",
    "most of the studies of accretion disk and studies of related outflow / jet have been evolved separately , assuming these two apparently to be dissimilar objects . however ,",
    "several observational inferences ( for details see gm09 , g10 and references therein ) and improved understanding of accretion flow and outflow reveal that accretion and outflow / jet are strongly correlated .",
    "the unifying scheme of disk and outflow is essentially governed by conservation laws ; conservations of matter , energy and momentum .",
    "hence , in modeling the accretion and outflow simultaneously in any accretion powered system , following aspects should be taken into account : ( 1 ) the effect of relativistic central gravitational potential including its spin , ( 2 ) proper mechanism of origin of outflow / jet from the disk , ( 3 ) appropriate hydrodynamic equations ( considering that the accreting gas be treated as a continuum fluid ) , capturing the information about the intrinsic coupling between inflow and outflow which are governed by the conservation laws in a strongly advective paradigm .",
    "recently , gm09 , g10 made an endeavor to explore the dynamics of the accretion - induced outflow around black holes / compact objects in a 2.5-dimensional paradigm .",
    "the authors formulated the disk - outflow coupled model in a more self - consistent way by solving a complete set of coupled partial differential hydrodynamic equations in a general advective regime through a self - similar approach in an axisymmetric , cylindrical coordinate system .",
    "they explicitly incorporated the information of the vertical flux in their model .",
    "however , they restricted their study to newtonian regime , thus negating the requisite effect of general - relativity , especially the effect of spin of the central object . based on the model , the authors computed the mass outflow rate and the power extracted by the outflow from the disk self - consistently , without proposing any prior relation between the inflow and outflow .    in the present paper ,",
    "we propose a new model for the accretion - induced outflow by extending the work of gm09 , g10 , by incorporating the general relativistic effect of the central potential without limiting ourselves to a self - similar regime . as the definitive mechanism of launching of outflows / jets",
    "is still evasive , we do not embrace any specific mechanism of outflow like inclusion of the magnetic field into our model equations .",
    "nevertheless , the importance of the magnetic field can not be , in principle , discarded to explain the launching and collimation of jets off the accretion disk . here ,",
    "owing to our inability to solve coupled partial differential mhd equations in a 2.5-dimensional advective regime , we neglect the influence of the magnetic field in our model equations .",
    "however , the implicit coupling between the inflow and outflow , dictated by the conservation equations , have been taken into account appropriately .",
    "we arrange our paper as follows . in the next section",
    ", we present the formulation of our model .",
    "the section 3 describes the computational procedure to solve the model equations of the accretion - induced outflow . in sections 4 and 5 ,",
    "we study the dynamics and the energetics of the flow respectively .",
    "finally , we end up in section 6 with a summary and discussion .",
    "we formulate the disk - outflow coupled model by considering a geometrically thick accretion disk , which is strongly advective as strong outflows / jets are more likely to eject from a thick / puffed up region of the accretion flow ( gm09,g10 ) . the vertical flow is explicitly included in the system .",
    "the basic features of the model are similar to that in gm09 .",
    "we adopt the cylindrical coordinate system to describe a steady , axisymmetric accretion flow .",
    "the dynamical flow parameters , namely , radial velocity ( @xmath0 ) , specific angular momentum ( @xmath1 ) , vertical velocity or outflow velocity ( @xmath2 ) , adiabatic sound speed ( @xmath3 ) , mass density ( @xmath4 ) and pressure ( @xmath5 ) depend both on radial and vertical coordinates . we have already highlighted the importance of the spin of black hole to power the outflow / jet and its presumed relative effect on the observation of various agn classes .",
    "thus we have included the effect of the spin in our model . as the spin of the black hole is a signature of pure general relativity , i.e. , einstein s gravitation , its effect on the accretion flow , especially in the inner region of the disk ,",
    "is mimicked approximately with the use of pseudo - general - relativistic or pseudo - newtonian potential ( pnp ) .",
    "because of the disk - outflow system to be geometrically thick and the flow to be 2.5-dimensional ( not confined to the equatorial plane ) , we use the pnp of ghosh & mukhopadhyay ( 2007 ) , which is a pseudo - newtonian vector potential , to capture the inner disk properties of the accretion flow around a kerr black hole approximately .    at the first instant we neglect the effect of viscosity in our system .",
    "one of the reasons behind it is the unavailability of the effective computational technique to solve coupled partial differential viscous hydrodynamic conservation equations for the compressible flow . to make the inviscid assumption more arguable ,",
    "it can also be noted that the angular momentum transport in the accretion flow , for which the necessity of turbulent viscosity is invoked , can alternatively take place purely by outflow . at this extreme end",
    ", the outflow extracts angular momentum from the disk allowing the matter to get accreted towards the black hole and hence the inviscid assumption can be adopted .",
    "this is in essence similar to the blandford & payne ( 1982 ) mechanism to extract energy and angular momentum from the magnetized disk , where the extraction of the angular momentum and energy is essentially done by the outflow , and not due to the viscous dissipation .",
    "the outflow originates from just above the equatorial plane of the disk and this lower boundary is maintained at @xmath6 , when @xmath7 , unlike other work where the outflow is hypothesized to effuse out from the disk surface ( e.g. xie & yuan 2008 ) .",
    "our model is effectively valid only in the region where disk and outflow are coupled , i.e. the region from where essentially the outflow is emanated from the accretion flow .",
    "hence our study will remain confined within this predefined region .",
    "further , we neglect the contribution of the magnetic field as argued in  1 .",
    "we circumvent the idea of vertical integration of the flow equations .",
    "the validity and the reliability of the height integrated equations is normally gratifying in the geometrically thin limit . in that circumstances ,",
    "the flow velocities are likely to be more or less independent of the disk scale - height , which is not the case of the present paradigm of interest .",
    "we further consider that the disk to be non - self - gravitating , assuming that the mass of the disk to be much less than that of the black hole .",
    "the radial and vertical coordinates are expressed in units of @xmath8 , flow velocities in @xmath9 , time in @xmath10 and the specific angular momentum in the unit of @xmath11 . here",
    "@xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath9 are gravitational constant , mass of the black hole and speed of light respectively .",
    "the steady state , axisymmetric disk - outflow coupled equations in cylindrical geometry in the inviscid limit are then as follows .",
    "\\(a ) mass transfer : @xmath14 where the first term is the signature of accretion and the second term attributes to outflow . as the outflow starts from just above @xmath6 surface , within the inflow region itself , we make a reasonable hypothesis that within the prescribed disk region the variation of the dynamical flow parameters with @xmath15 is much less than that with @xmath16 , allowing us to choose @xmath17 ; for any parameter @xmath18 .",
    "strictly speaking , the weak variation with @xmath15 ensures that the outflow originating from the mid - plane of the disk does not disrupt the disk structure , and thus allowing a smooth accretion flow towards the black hole",
    ". thus eqn .",
    "( [ 1a ] ) then reduces to @xmath19    \\(b ) radial momentum balance : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is radial component of the gravitational force . as discussed earlier , here @xmath21 is the radial force corresponding to the pnp in cylindrical coordinate system given by ghosh & mukhopadhyay ( 2007 ) containing the information of spin of the black hole . with the similar argument as above the equation then reduces to @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the radial velocity at the mid - plane of the disk .",
    "\\(c ) azimuthal momentum balance : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the azimuthal velocity of the flow .",
    "the first term of this equation signifies the radial transport of the angular momentum , while the second term describes the extraction of angular momentum due to mass loss in the outflow .",
    "if we consider that the net angular momentum extracted by the outflow be @xmath26 , and the remaining angular momentum retained by the disk @xmath27 , then total angular momentum @xmath28 can be assumed to remain constant throughout the flow within our predefined disk - outflow region by the virtue of an inviscid flow .",
    "therefore , @xmath29",
    "\\(d ) vertical momentum balance : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the vertical component of the gravitational force , described by ghosh & mukhopadhyay ( 2007 ) .",
    "following previous arguments this reduces to @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the pressure of the flow at the mid - plane of the disk . if there is no outflow , then @xmath34 , and eqn .",
    "( [ 4b ] ) reduces to the well known hydrostatic equilibrium condition in the disk , and the hydrostatic disk scale - height can be obtained .",
    "similarly , one can customarily extend the vertical momentum equation to compute the disk scale - height when there is an outflow coupled with the disk .",
    "thus we will use eqn .",
    "( [ 4b ] ) to obtain the scale - height of the disk - outflow coupled system .",
    "we can reasonably assume that at height @xmath35 ( i.e. at @xmath15=@xmath35 ) , the pressure of the disk is much less compared to that at the equatorial plane to prevent any disruption of the disk , permitting a steady structure of accretion flow .",
    "the variation of density along @xmath15 direction is approximately kept constant ( @xmath36 ) which in turn means that the disk - outflow coupled region is weakly stratified . considering the above facts , eqn .",
    "( [ 4b ] ) is simplified to obtain the scale - height as @xmath37 where @xmath35 is thus the the root of the above transcendental equation",
    ". thus eqns .",
    "( [ 1b ] ) , ( [ 2b ] ) , ( [ 3b ] ) & ( [ 4c ] ) will simultaneously have to be solved to obtain the dynamics and the energetics of the accretion - induced outflow .",
    "we assume that the accretion flow follows an adiabatic equation of state @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the polytropic and the adiabatic indices respectively .",
    "note that constant @xmath42 carries the information of entropy ( e.g. mukhopadhyay 2003 ) of the flow .",
    "thus for an adiabatic flow , @xmath43 . in an earlier work ( gm09 ) , a reasonable assumption was made that @xmath44 , which can be approximately accepted for a geometrically thick , 2.5-dimensional disk structure . presuming that the outflow velocity is not likely to exceed the sound speed at the disk - outflow surface ( the outer boundary of the accretion flow in the @xmath15 direction )",
    ", we propose a simplified relation between @xmath3 and @xmath45 as @xmath46    hence , at @xmath47 , we obtain @xmath48 this implies that the outflow can ideally come out off the disk surface which can appropriately be termed as the sonic surface in the vertical direction . with this notion in mind",
    "let us generalize this particular scaling between @xmath45 and @xmath3 , pertaining to our formalism as @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the constants which will be determined by substituting eqn .",
    "( [ 5c ] ) in our model conservation equations described in  2 .",
    "the index @xmath51 measures the degree of subsonic nature of the vertical flow within the disk - outflow coupled region ( i.e. in between the mid - plane and the surface of the accretion flow ) .    generalizing the procedure adopted in earlier works for 1.5-dimensional disks ( chakrabarti 1996 ; mukhopadhyay 2003 ; mukhopadhyay & ghosh 2003 ) , we solve eqns .",

    "the value of specific angular momentum in our flow always remains constant and is same as @xmath69 , the value at sonic radius , by virtue of eqn .",
    "( [ 3b ] ) .    until now ,",
    "we have emphasized on velocity profiles of the accretion - induced outflow at any arbitrary @xmath15 .",
    "we have , however , mentioned before that the intrinsic coupling of inflow and outflow is confined within a specified region , from where the outflow emanates .",
    "the disk - outflow inter - correlated region is bounded vertically from the mid - plane ( @xmath6 ) to an upper surface above which any inflow of matter ceased to exist .",
    "we aim at precisely investigating the nature and dynamics of the flow at different layers within this disk - outflow coupled region .",
    "therefore , we first need to calculate the scale - height of the accretion flow , based on our proposed model , and obtain the disk - outflow surface ( upper boundary ) .",
    "it is to be noted that the transcendental eqn .",
    "( [ 4c ] ) can not be independently used to calculate the scale - height @xmath35 or its general variance with @xmath16 , for unknown variables @xmath0 and @xmath3 .",
    "nevertheless , we can easily obtain the scale - height @xmath35 at @xmath56 , say @xmath70 , from eqn .",
    "( [ 4c ] ) as radial velocity and sound speed at the sonic location are known .",
    "thus at @xmath56 , eqn .",
    "( [ 4c ] ) simplifies to @xmath71\\\\   & & + f_{gzc}|_h -\\frac{c_{s0c}^2}{\\gamma h_c } = 0 ,   \\label{6a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath72 is @xmath73 at the sonic location in the plane with scale - height @xmath35",
    ". then @xmath70 obtained from eqn .",
    "( [ 6a ] ) can be inserted into eqn .",
    "( [ 5f ] ) to obtain @xmath74 at scale - height @xmath35 .",
    "the disk scale - height @xmath35 without any outflow is seen to be linearly increasing with @xmath16 ( approximately by dimensional analysis ) . for a 2.5-dimensional disk - outflow system",
    ", it seems that @xmath35 and @xmath16 can also be linearly connected , based on the order of magnitude analysis ( gm09 ) .",
    "however , unlike the thin disk , strong gas pressure gradient in the disk - outflow coupled system leads to a geometrically thick 2.5-dimensional disk .",
    "therefore , for the present purpose we make a generalized scaling of @xmath35 with @xmath16 as @xmath75 where @xmath76 be a dimensionless arbitrary constant or any numerical variable ( discussed in detail later ) .",
    "the impressionable choice about the factor @xmath76 would be that it should contain precisely the information of the nature of the flow .",
    "the only physical information we can extract related to the scale - height from our model equations is @xmath70 .",
    "thus we rationally demand an approximate expression for dimensionless parameter @xmath76 as @xmath77 it is found that the value of @xmath76 circumvents around @xmath78 , for the entire range of spin parameter of the black hole , which here acts as a normalization constant .",
    "thus eventually , eqns .",
    "( [ 5d ] ) , ( [ 5f ] ) , ( [ 6b ] ) & ( [ 6c ] ) are combined together to obtain @xmath0 and @xmath3 along the scale - height @xmath35 for an accretion - induced outflow .",
    "it also appears that under all these circumstances , and for a physically acceptable flow , the constant @xmath79 and the index @xmath51 of eqn .",
    "( [ 5c ] ) connecting @xmath45 and @xmath3 yield to be @xmath80 and @xmath81 respectively .      after establishing the scale - height @xmath35",
    ", we in principle can obtain the profiles of the dynamical parameters at different layers of the disk , i.e. at @xmath82 , where @xmath83 , within our prescribed disk - outflow region .",
    "we find that the radial velocity profile @xmath0 along all layers of disk for any arbitrary spin parameter exhibits some unusual , yet very interesting behavior . for any specific @xmath15 and spin parameter @xmath84",
    ", @xmath0 attains a negative value at a radius greater than a certain distance @xmath85 .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath86 decreases with the increase of @xmath87 , which indicates that the positive trait of @xmath0 is greater for lower @xmath15 .",
    "the negative value of @xmath0 does not necessarily reflect any unphysical behavior .",
    "if the outflow originates from any particular layer @xmath88 at a radius @xmath89 @xmath86 , it then appears that the coupling between the disk and the outflow ceased to exist .",
    "it infers that along the layer @xmath88 , both accretion and outflow simultaneously occur up to the radial distance @xmath86 , and beyond which the solution ( with negative @xmath0 ) reflects the truncation of the disk ( along the specified layer ) .",
    "let us consider different layers of @xmath15 . as we ascend to layers from a lower to a higher @xmath15",
    ", the truncation of the disk - outflow region along these layers occurs at a radius smaller than that of the lower @xmath15 .",
    "as accretion is the source of the outflow , we can ostensibly conclude that the region from where the outflowing matter originates in the disk shrinks as we go to higher latitudes .",
    "note that @xmath86 corresponds to zero @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , we restrict our study up to the boundary @xmath86 . with this insight , we simply compute @xmath86 along various layers of the disk and construct a surface in the @xmath90 plane connecting all @xmath86 for different layers .",
    "the enclosed region bounded by this surface is defined by the positivity of @xmath0 , where both the accretion and outflow simultaneously persist and are intrinsically coupled to each other .",
    "we attribute the outer surface of the region as disk - outflow surface ( @xmath91 ) and above this layer no inflow takes place .",
    "the arrows in the diagram shown in fig . 1",
    "reveal the direction of flow .",
    "the arrow exactly at @xmath86 points vertically upwards , which indicates that just at @xmath86 the flow pattern exclusively corresponds to vertical motion and any accretion flow ceased to exist .",
    "however , more realistic disk - outflow surface could be visualized with a thick - solid line shown in fig",
    ". 1 .        as in our system",
    "we have neglected the viscosity and any radiative loss , and thus the flow is considered to be strongly advective , presumably it is gas pressure dominated .",
    "notwithstanding , various scattering processes will indeed produce radiation in the system , whose contribution could be insignificant .",
    "hence , @xmath92 is reasonably an appropriate choice in our model . and @xmath93 , the ratio of gas pressure to the total pressure , is given by @xmath94 ( gm09 ) .",

    "]    the marginally stable orbit in a keplerian accretion flow defines the inner edge of the disk ( with zero torque condition ) .",
    "however the orbit is more or less an artifact of the flow . for a transonic advective disk ( as is the present case ) ,",
    "an apriori definition of inner edge is somewhat fuzzy , due to which we can pretend to choose that the disk extends to the black hole horizon . in presence of an outflow",
    "intrinsically coupled to the disk , there is supposed to be an inner boundary beyond which any outflow and then jet will ceased to exist .",
    "we define this inner boundary of the disk - outflow coupled region in explaining the energetics of the flow .",
    "also , with the increase of the spin of the black hole , it is seen that the disk - outflow coupled region shrinks considerably , attaining a steeper nature . literally speaking",
    ", the spin of the black hole directly influences the nature and region of the outflow .",
    "the tendency of the outflow region to get contracted to the inner radius suggests that the outflow is more likely to exuberantly emanate from inner region of the disk for rapidly spinning black holes which have more gravitating power .",
    "therefore , with the increase in spin , the disk - outflow region becomes more dense and more susceptible to eject the matter with a greater power .",
    "as the system is gas pressure dominated and strongly advective , it is more receptive to strong outflows . figures 3 and 4 describe the variation of flow parameters as functions of radial coordinate @xmath16 along the disk - outflow surface for various spin of the black hole . with the increase of the spin of the black hole ,",

    "accretion by a black hole is the primary source of energy of the mass outflow from the inner disk region .",
    "the energetics of the accretion - induced outflow are mainly attributed to the mass outflow rate and the power extracted by the outflow from the disk .",
    "the derivation of the mass outflow rate had been elaborated in g10 .",

    "the corresponding proportionality constant is determined at a radius , outside which the contribution to the mass outflow rate is negligible ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "however , the total mass accretion rate @xmath102 ( which is sum of the inflow rate and the outflow rate ) can be obtained by integrating the continuity equation along the radial and vertical directions .",

    "we describe the dynamical variables in our study within the region between an outer boundary and @xmath111 , and within this prescribed region strong outflows are most plausible to originate , intrinsically coupled to the disk .",

    "blandford - znajek process ( blandford & znajek 1977 ) is still one of the most promising mechanisms to drive powerful jets in agns and xrbs .",
    "although the exact mechanism of formation of the jet in the vicinity of the black holes is still elusive , and whatever might be the reason for the origin of jet , the said work is significant mostly due to two underlying reasons : ( 1 ) extreme gravity is indispensable to effuse strong unbounded flows in the vertical direction from the inner region of the accretion disk , ( 2 ) the spin of the black holes , which is purely a relativistic effect , is essential to power strong outflows and jets .    in the present study , we have neither laid importance to the nature of the outflow nor invoked any aspect for the origin of outflows or jets .",
    "indeed , the distinctive or definitive understanding of the formation of strong outflows or jets is till unknown .",
    "notwithstanding , the most distinguishable and obvious picture in this case is that outflows and jets observed in agns and xrbs can only originate in an accretion powered system , where the accretion of matter around relativistic gravitating objects like black holes acts as a source , and outflow and then jet takes the form of one of the possible sinks ( the other sink is the central nucleus ) .",
    "the dynamics of the outflowing matter should then be intrinsically coupled to the accretion dynamics macroscopically through the fundamental laws of conservation ( of matter , momentum and energy ) .",
    "the outflow is unbounded and the total energy just at the base of the outflow should be positive .",
    "the accretion flow should be bounded in the vicinity of the central object as the central potential is attractive . however , the strength of the unbounded flows in the form of jets is distinctly proportional to the attractiveness of the central gravitational potential field .",
    "this paradox is well manifested in the observed universe , as relativistic jets are more populated around extreme gravitating objects like black holes . also noticeably , length scale of jets increases from microquasars to quasars , which are supposedly harboring stellar mass and supermassive black holes respectively .",
    "thus in any theoretical modeling of the accretion and outflow , it can be presumably argued that the mathematical equations governing the dynamics of the inflow and outflow should inherently be correlated and evolved self - consistently without any ad hoc proposition , as accretion and outflow should not be treated as dissimilar objects .",
    "second , the relativistic gravitational effect of the black hole should be incorporated , as the nature of gravity is the cornerstone to both the accretion and the unbounded outflow . to capture this essential physics , in our present study to understand the connection between disk and outflow , we have incorporated the general relativistic effect of the spinning black hole through a pseudo - newtonian approach . although pseudo - newtonian formalism is an approximate method to mimic the space - time geometry of the kerr black hole , yet it captures the important salient features of the corresponding metric , and thus can be used to examine the nature of outflows from the inner region of the disk .",
    "in  2 we have described the general disk - outflow coupled hydrodynamic equations in the inviscid limit following gm09 .",
    "the necessity to simplify our model equations for an inviscid flow is discussed in  2 .",
    "although gm09 explored the 2.5-dimensional accretion - induced outflow for a fully viscous system , they used a self - similar approach in order to solve the necessary partial coupled differential equations .",
    "in addition , they neglected the most indispensable effect of relativistic gravitation or , precisely , the effect of spin of the black hole . in the present paper , we have solved the disk - outflow model equations in a more general 2.5-dimensional paradigm , while trying to limit our assumptions to the least possible extent theoretically .",
    "one of the important premises we have made is the relationship between @xmath45 and @xmath3 , which we have established empirically .",
    "we have not used the height integrated equations which are mostly valid in the circumstances where the dynamical fluid parameters are likely to be independent of @xmath15 . without presuming the fact that the outflow originates from the surface of the disk , as most of the authors do , we have logically constructed a disk - outflow surface with properly defined boundary conditions .",
    "one of the most important computations we have done is to evaluate the mass outflow rate and the power of the outflow extracted from the disk self - consistently in the inviscid limit , unlike the previous works ( e.g. donea & biermann 1996 ; blandford & begelman 1999 ; xie & yuan 2008 ) .",
    "we have found that the spin of the black hole plays a crucial role in determining the structure , dynamics and the energetics of the outflow coupled to the disk . with the increase of the spin",
    ", the outflow region extends further inward and then the disk - outflow region shrinks and compresses ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . as a result , the outflow and",
    "then any plausible jet is likely to eject out from an extreme inner region of the flow around a rapidly spinning black hole with a greater efficiency .",
    "note that the higher spin results in the system to get more compressed with a greater outflow power .",
    "therefore , the efficiency of outflow and jet is directly related to the disk scale - height and hence the disk - outflow surface . previously , in a different context , mckinney & gammie ( 2004 ) , while examining the electromagnetic luminosity of a kerr black hole , assumed the ratio of the disk height to the radius ( @xmath120 ) constant , irrespective of the black hole spin . however , as seen in the present work , the constant @xmath120 for different spin of the black hole may not be an obvious choice .",
    "the power extracted by the outflow from the disk not only depends directly on the mass of the black hole and the initial mass accretion rate of the flow , but also on the spin of the black hole . with our model ,",
    "keeping the black hole mass and the accretion rate the same , the power of the outflow increases with the spin of the black hole and the computed power differs in two orders of magnitude between non - rotating and maximally rotating black holes .",
    "we have restricted our study vertically up to the region where the inflow and the outflow are least coupled , i.e. the disk - outflow surface . above this surface accretion ceased to exist and probably the outflow gets decoupled from the disk , accelerates and eventually forms relativistic jet .",
    "the modeling of the astrophysical jet is altogether a different issue and is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "nevertheless , it can be effectively argued that in modeling the dynamics of the jet , the computed outflow power may serve as an initial power fed to the jet .",
    "thus , the dynamics and the energetics of the jet will eventually be related to the black hole spin .    according to the unification scenario , it is possible to device a single astrophysical scenario , which can broadly explain the observed multitude of different types of agns ( see e.g. antonucci 1993 ; urry & padovani 1995 ) .",
    "flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) and bl lacs are probably the two most active types of agns which are collectively referred to blazar .",
    "it is observed that bl lacs are relatively low luminous than fsrqs .",
    "although both of these galaxies show high energy emissions , their spectral properties are different ( bhattacharya et al . 2009 ) which indicate that they are different source classes .",
    "according to the unification scheme , for fsrqs the line - of - sight is almost parallel to the jet and , hence , strong relativistic doppler beaming of the jet emission produces highly variable and continuum dominated emission .",
    "as one moves away from the jet axis , the central continuum emission falls and the nucleus looks like a fr - ii galaxy .",
    "similarly , bl lacs are considered to be a sub class of fr - i galaxies whose line - of - sight is almost parallel to the jet axis .",
    "the present work suggests that the total mechanical power of an outflow proportionately increases with the spin of the central supermassive black hole ; higher the spin , stronger is the outflow .",
    "it is reasonable to consider that strong outflow can lead to a strong jet , and hence , one can expect to observe higher luminosity .",
    "therefore , the work suggests that bl lacs are slow rotators than fsrqs .    for the theoretical formulation of the disk - outflow coupling",
    "even with approximations , one needs to be very thoughtful for the proper foundation of the model which essentially needs to solve hydrodynamic or magnetohydrodynamic conservation equations in presence of strong gravity .",
    "the flow parameters vary in 2.5-dimension and are coupled to each other .",
    "limited observational inputs put irremediable constraint on the boundary conditions as well as the fundamental scaling parameters , governing the coupled dynamics of the accretion and outflow . the inadequacy of an effective mathematical tool to handle partial coupled differential hydrodynamic equations for compressible flow motivates us to invoke approximations and assumptions . despite of this fact",
    ", one needs to explore the possibilities to examine the accretion - induced outflow .",
    "the question then arises : what are the valid assumptions and to which extent they can be considered ? in the present work , we have addressed this question in the following way . + ( 1 ) as the extreme gravity is the most important aspect to effuse jet from the disk , we have incorporated its effect through a pseudo - general - relativistic potential .",
    "+ ( 2 ) the disk and outflow should not be treated as dissimilar objects , and hence their correlated - dynamics should be essentially governed by the conservation laws .",
    "the energetics of the accretion - induced outflow would then be evaluated self - consistently as is shown in our work .",
    "+ ( 3 ) any unbounded flow in the form of outflow is more plausible to emanate from a hot , puffed up region of the accretion flow ( may be low / hard state of the black hole ) .",
    "hence we have formulated our model in a 2.5-dimensional , strongly advective paradigm , surpassing the simplicity of height integration .",
    "+ ( 4 ) we have approximated our system to an inviscid limit , whose reason has been argued in  2 .",
    "nevertheless , in any future work , viscosity should be incorporated into the flow to make it more realistic . +",
    "( 5 ) we do not account for the mechanism of formation of strong jets , like due to magnetic field or strong radiation pressure , as the definitive mechanism of the formation of jet is still unknown .",
    "indeed , it is beyond the scope to solve magnetohydrodynamic equations in the present scenario .",
    "however , assuming that the outflow resides , and is coupled to the disk , the governing conservation equations of matter , momentum and energy should be treated accordingly .",
    "+ ( 6 ) power of the outflow and jet is expected to directly depend on the spin of the black hole .",
    "the spin , which is the signature of general relativity , can make an impact on the nature of the observed agn classes , and thus the spin of the black has been incorporated in our study .",
    "as spin of the black hole has a direct impact on the flow parameters , we obtain different outflow power for different spin .    what can be the most defined parameter for the accretion powered system  mass accretion rate , mass of the central star / black hole or the spin of the central star / black hole ?",
    "our analysis has shown that the power extracted by the outflow from the disk proportionately increases with the spin of the black hole .",
    "it infers that if extreme gravity is essential to power the jet , then the strength and the length - scale of the observed astrophysical jets directly depend on the spin of the black hole .",
    "if it is believed that the distant quasars harbor massive black holes of same mass scale and accrete matter with similar rate , perhaps , spin be the guiding parameter for the different observed agn classes .",
    "we can end with the specific question : are the observed agn classes astrophysical laboratories to measure the spin of the supermassive black holes ? + this work is supported by a project , grant no .",
