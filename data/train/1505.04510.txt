    "the origin of the stronger spin - fluctuation spectral weight at one dominant q@xmath94 value in nno / ngo [ fig .  6(g ) ] is related to the underlying band structure and nesting - driven fs instability , which is found to be weaker in nno / lao .",
    "this indicates that nno / ngo is prone to a magnetic instability through dynamical fluctuations resulting in its stronger band renormalization found in the metallic state , which ultimately may account for its higher mit .",
    "in summary , we have presented the first momentum - resolved study of the electronic structure of nno thin films across the mit as a function of epitaxial strain ( using two different substrates ) . both compressive and tensile",
    "strained films in the metallic phase showed 3d fs and share common elements : spheroidal electron like pockets centered at @xmath69 and large cuboidal hole like pockets at the 3d bz corners .",
    "the corresponding bands are strongly renormalized in the metallic phase , in agreement with theoretical calculations .",
    "a transfer of the spectral weight from near @xmath9 region to higher binding energy occurs in the entire bz across the mit . on the basis of these observations",
    ", we have performed a self - energy calculation due to spin and charge fluctuation in the dynamical correlation limit , which shows that the intertwined fs nesting and the dynamical correlation effects are stronger in nno / ngo than nno / lao .",
    "we find that the strain reduces crystal field splitting in nno / lao , lowering the @xmath93 states and lifting those of the @xmath86 orbitals .",
    "this leads to the appearance of a new holelike fs at the @xmath77point , which plays a crucial role in lowering the mit .",
    "our study provides insights into the physical mechanisms responsible of driving the mit in complex oxides , implying how strain , nesting , correlations , and magnetic fluctuations can be tuned , which may help the future development of rare earth nickelates in applications @xcite .",
