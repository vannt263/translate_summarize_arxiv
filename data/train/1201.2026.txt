    "phase - change materials based on chalcogenide alloys are attracting an increasing interest worldwide due to their ability to undergo reversible and fast transitions between the amorphous and crystalline phases upon heating  @xcite .",
    "this property is exploited in rewriteable optical media ( cd , dvd , blu - ray discs ) and electronic nonvolatile memories ( nvm ) , which are based on the strong optical and electronic contrast between the two phases  @xcite .",
    "the material of choice for nvm applications is the ternary compound ge@xmath0sb@xmath0te@xmath1 ( gst ) .",
    "however , the related binary alloy gete has also been thoroughly investigated because of its higher crystallization temperature and better data retention at high temperature with respect to gst .    in the last few years",
    "atomistic simulations based on density functional theory ( dft ) have provided useful insights into the properties of phase change materials  @xcite . however , several key issues such as the thermal conductivity at the nanoscale , the crystallization dynamics , and the properties of the crystalline / amorphous interface , just to name a few , are presently beyond the reach of ab initio simulations due to the high computational costs .",
    "the development of reliable classical interatomic potentials is a possible route to overcome the limitations in system size and time scale of ab initio molecular dynamics .",
    "however , traditional approaches based on the fitting of comparably simple functional forms for the interatomic potentials are very challenging due to the complexity of the chemical bonding in the crystalline and amorphous phases revealed by the ab initio simulations .",
    "a possible solution has been proposed recently by behler and parrinello  @xcite , who developed high - dimensional interatomic potentials with close to ab initio accuracy employing artificial neural networks ( nn ) . to date , potentials of this type have been reported for silicon  @xcite , carbon  @xcite , sodium  @xcite , zinc oxide  @xcite and copper  @xcite by fitting large ab initio databases .    here",
    "we describe the development of a classical interatomic potential for the bulk phases of gete employing this nn technique .",
    "the potential is validated by comparing results on the structural and dynamical properties of liquid , amorphous and crystalline gete derived from nn - based simulations with the ab initio data obtained in our previous work  @xcite .",
    "artificial neural networks constitute a class of algorithms inspired by the properties of biological neural networks , which are widely applied in many different fields ranging from weather forecasting to robotics  @xcite . in the last few years ,",
    "nn have also been used as a tool to construct interatomic potentials  @xcite to this aim , the nn are exploited as a non - linear technique that allows fitting any real - valued function to arbitrary accuracy , without any previous knowledge about the functional form of the underlying problem  @xcite . in our case , this function is the potential energy surface ( pes ) of the atomistic system and the goal of the nn is to construct a functional relation between the energy and the atomic configuration .    given a number of atomic configurations , for which the ab initio energies are known , the nn parameters are adjusted to reproduce these energies in the training process .",
    "overfitting , i.e. , obtaining a good fit of the training data , but performing less accurately when making predictions is controlled by testing the performance of the nn for an independent test set not used in the fitting .",
    "once trained , the nn performs an interpolation to construct the potential energy for new atomic configurations at a low computational load , which allows performing long molecular dynamics runs for large systems .",
    "the nn methodology overcomes many problems associated with classical potentials .",
    "first and foremost , nn completely obviate the problem of guessing a complicated functional form of the interatomic potential .",
    "this form is determined automatically by the nn . moreover ,",
    "the entire training procedure is fully automated so that nn can be readily extended to new regions of the pes .",
    "finally , the accurate mapping of ab initio energies ensures that all properties determined by the topology of the pes are described with an accuracy comparable with that of first principles calculations .",
    "nn have been successfully used to interpolate the pes of simple chemical systems like small molecules  @xcite and molecule - surface interactions  @xcite .    until recently",
    ", the main limitation of most nn approaches has been the small number of degrees of freedom that could be described , which confined their application to very small systems .",
    "this limitation has been overcome by behler and parrinello who introduced a nn potential , in which the total energy is expressed as a sum of atomic energy contributions depending on the local environments @xcite . in this approach",
    "the energy contribution of each atom is evaluated using an individual nn instead of using one nn for the total energy of the system .",
    "the local environment of a given atom is described by a set of local parameters called symmetry functions , which include radial and angular many - body terms and depend on the positions of all neighbors within a specified cutoff radius  @xcite .",
    "the use of symmetry functions instead of cartesian coordinates as nn inputs and the partitioning of the total energy into atomic contributions ensures that all quantities computed with the nn potential , such as energies , analytical forces , and stress tensor are invariant to translations , rotations , and atoms exchange .",
    "furthermore , once the fit is obtained , the nn potential can be applied to systems containing an arbitrary number of atoms .",
    "the validity of this approach has been demonstrated by reproducing the high - pressure phase diagram of silicon , carbon , and sodium  @xcite .",
    "this scheme has been recently extended to binary systems by including long range coulomb interaction between environment dependent ionic charges  @xcite .    in the case of gete ,",
    "we are faced with the problem of developing a potential suitable to describe both the semiconducting crystalline and amorphous phases as well as the metallic liquid . as a first step toward the development of a nn potential for gete , we neglect long - range coulomb interactions for atoms being separated by a larger distance than the cutoff radius of the symmetry functions .",
    "the resulting `` short - ranged '' nn potential just consists of atomic energy contributions arising from the local chemical environments , but it is important to note that also short - ranged electrostatic interactions are fully taken into account implicitly .",
    "more details of the employed method can be found elsewhere  @xcite . the resulting potential will not be able to describe the dielectric response and lo - to splitting of crystalline gete in its ferroelectric phase , but it will be suitable to reproduce structural properties of the liquid , amorphous and crystalline phases and the dynamical properties of the disordered phases .      to generate the nn potential , we fitted the total energies of about 30.000 configurations of 64- , 96- and 216-atom supercells computed by dft .",
    "we started with a relatively small dataset of about 5.000 structures , where we considered crystalline configurations , snapshots of the liquid phase and of the amorphous phase generated by quenching from the melt at ambient conditions and at different pressures up to 50 gpa .",
    "we also considered mixed crystalline / amorphous models generated by partially crystallizing the amorphous phase by means of the metadynamics technique  @xcite .",
    "all these configurations were generated within ab initio molecular dynamics simulations at different temperatures ( up to 3000 k ) with the code cp2k  @xcite .",
    "this first dataset was then expanded by adding randomly distorted structures of the initial dataset at slightly different pressures and temperatures and models with slight deviations from the perfect stoichiometry .",
    "the refinement of the potential was achieved by inserting in the data set the ab initio energy of configurations generated by molecular dynamics simulations ( see below ) using the not yet refined nn potential .",
    "total energy convergence has to be strictly guaranteed for every point of the dataset to make the nn input fully consistent .",
    "therefore , we had to perform brillouin zone ( bz ) integration over a dense @xmath2 monkhorst - pack ( mp )  @xcite mesh for the 64-atom cell and employing meshes of a corresponding k - point density for the larger systems .",
    "the ab initio energies were calculated using the quantum - espresso package  @xcite .",
    "the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe )  @xcite exchange - correlation functional and norm conserving pseudopotentials were employed , considering only the outermost @xmath3 and @xmath4 electrons in the valence shell . the kohn - sham orbitals were expanded in a plane waves basis up to a kinetic energy cutoff of 40  ry .",
    "these settings ensure convergence of the total energy to 2  mev / atom .",
    "the best nn fit we found employs three hidden layers with 20 nodes each .",
    "sigmoidal activation functions were used in the nodes of the hidden layers , while a linear function was used for the output node .",
    "details concerning the architecture of the nn can be found elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the local environment of each atom is defined by the value of 159 symmetry functions ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) defined in terms of the positions of all neighbors within a distance cutoff of 6.88   .",
    "the generation of the nn potential and the calculation of the forces for the md simulations were performed with the nn code runner  @xcite .",
    "we used the tinker  @xcite code as md driver . the time step for the md runs",
    "was set to 0.2  fs , and constant temperature simulations were performed using the berendsen thermostat  @xcite .",
    "the results of the fitting process of the nn potential are summarized in fig .",
    "the root mean square error ( rmse ) for the energy is 5.01 and 5.60 mev / atom for the training and the test set , respectively , while the rmses of the forces are 0.46 and 0.47 ev /  , for the two sets . among all structures considered ,",
    "only a negligible fraction shows noticeable absolute errors , up to 25.8 mev / atom and 11.2 ev / @xmath5 for energies and forces ( see fig . [ fig1 ] insets ) .",
    "we have found that these configurations correspond to high - energy structures that are not visited in md simulations carried out in the present work .",
    "the equilibrium geometry of the trigonal phase of crystalline gete ( @xmath6 space group ) was obtained by optimizing all structural parameters consisting of the lattice parameter @xmath7 , the trigonal angle @xmath8 and the internal parameter @xmath9 that assigns the positions of the two atoms in the unit cell , namely ge at ( @xmath9,@xmath9,@xmath9 ) and te at ( -@xmath9,-@xmath9,-@xmath9 )  @xcite .",

    "the structure of trigonal gete can be seen as a distorted rocksalt geometry with an elongation of the cube diagonal along the [ 111 ] direction and an off - center displacement of the inner te atom along the [ 111 ] direction , which moves to a distance @xmath11 from the ge atom at the vertex as shown in fig .",

    "cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the structural properties of a - gete and a - gst have been elucidated recently by ab initio simulations  @xcite . in these systems",
    "ge and te atoms are mostly four - coordinated and three - coordinated , respectively . te atoms are in a defective octahedral - like environment , which resembles the local environment of the corresponding crystalline phases .",
    "the majority of ge atoms are in a defective octahedral environment too , but about one quarter of ge atoms are in a tetrahedral - like geometry .",
    "the presence of homopolar ge - ge ( and , in the case of gst , ge - sb ) bonds favors the tetrahedral coordination .    in the following ,",
    "we compare the structural properties of models of amorphous gete generated by nn and ab initio simulations .",
    "the nn amorphous phase was generated by quenching the molten sample from 1150 k to room temperature in 100 ps .",
    "average properties are obtained from a nve simulation 40 ps long at an average temperature of 300 k. doubling or even tripling the quenching time ( up to 300 ps ) does not introduce sizable changes in the structural and vibrational properties of our nn model of amorphous gete .",

    "the agreement between nn and dft data is overall very good .",
    "the largest discrepancy is on the height of the first peak of the ge - ge pair correlation function .",
    "however , this misfit is partially due to fluctuations in the number of ge - ge bonds in the still small 216-atom cell ( cf . figs .",
    "s1-s2 in epaps  @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , by generating ten different 216-atom models with the nn potential we observed sizable fluctuations in the average ge - ge coordination number ranging from 0.6 to 0.9 . a more compelling comparison would require the availability of several independent ab initio models of a - gete .",
    "another discrepancy with the dft results is the presence of a small peak at around 60@xmath12 in the angle distribution function due to a very small fraction of three membered rings ( see below ) .",
    "following our previous works @xcite , we quantified the fraction of ge atoms in a tetrahedral geometry by computing the local order parameter @xmath13 where the sum runs over the pairs of atoms bonded to a central atom @xmath14 .",

    "we estimated the fraction of tetrahedral ge atoms by integrating the @xmath18-distribution of 4-coordinated ge from 0.8 to 1 .",
    "this procedure was demonstrated to provide reliable values for the fraction of tetrahedral ge from the analysis of the wannier functions that allow a direct identification of the tetrahedral geometry in terms of the electronic structure  @xcite .",

    "the ab initio value is very close to the value obtained by averaging over the ten 216-atom nn models while the fraction of tetrahedral ge in the large 4096-atom cell is 24  @xmath20 , a value very close to the average over the ten small cells and also to the result obtained for a 1728-atom model ( 22  @xmath20 ) .",
    "the concentration of tetrahedra depends on the fraction of ge - ge homopolar bonds , which is the property more affected by finite size effects in the small 216-atom cell .",

    "we also optimized the density of the amorphous model at zero temperature by interpolating the energy - volume points with a murnaghan equation of state .",
    "we obtained an equilibrium density of 0.03351 atoms @xmath21 to be compared with the value of 0.03156 atoms @xmath21 resulting from the ab initio equation of state of a 216-atom cell with the bz integration restricted to the @xmath22-point  @xcite .",

    "projections on the different type of atoms ( te , ge in tetrahedral and defective octahedral geometries ) are also shown .    in an amorphous material , phonons display localization properties , which depend on frequency . to address this issue and following",
    "our previous ab initio works  @xcite , we computed the inverse participation ratio ( @xmath23 ) of the @xmath14-th vibrational mode defined as    @xmath24    here @xmath25 are phonon eigenvectors and the sum over @xmath26 runs over the @xmath27 atoms in the unit cell with masses @xmath28 .",
    "according to this definition , the value of @xmath23 varies from @xmath29 for a completely delocalized phonon , to one for a mode completely localized on a single atom .",
    "the values of @xmath23 for the nn and ab initio models of a - gete are reported in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] .",
    "the nn potential reproduces the strong localization on tetrahedra of phonons above 200  @xmath30 . the overall shape and frequency range of the phonon dos",
    "is reasonably reproduced by the nn potential .",
    "a discrepancy is present in the relative height of the two main structures at 50  @xmath30 and 150  @xmath30 , which , however , might be partially due to the still small size of the 216-atom cell . actually the dos of the different 216-atom models generated by the nn potentials are all very similar , but somehow different from the large 4096-atom cell due to a size effect",
    "in summary , a nn potential for the phase change material gete has been created and tested to reproduce the properties of crystalline , liquid and amorphous phases .",
    "the nn potential has been validated by comparing the results on structural and dynamical properties of the bulk phases of gete with our previous data from dft calculations  @xcite .",
    "the development of a classical potential with close to ab initio accuracy represents a breakthrough in the simulation of phase change materials , as it will allow addressing several key issues on the properties of this class of materials that are presently beyond the reach of ab initio simulations .",
    "the study of thermal conductivity in the amorphous phase  @xcite and the dynamics of homogeneous and heterogeneous crystallization are few examples of useful follow - on developments of this work , which promises to improve our microscopic understanding of the operation of phase change memories .",

    "<S> gete is a prototypical phase change material of high interest for applications in optical and electronic non - volatile memories . </S>",
    "<S> we present an interatomic potential for the bulk phases of gete , which is created using a neural network ( nn ) representation of the potential - energy surface obtained from reference calculations based on density functional theory . </S>",
    "<S> it is demonstrated that the nn potential provides a close to ab initio quality description of a number of properties of liquid , crystalline and amorphous gete . </S>",
    "<S> the availability of a reliable classical potential allows addressing a number of issues of interest for the technological applications of phase change materials , which are presently beyond the capability of first principles molecular dynamics simulations . </S>"
