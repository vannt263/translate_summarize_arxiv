    "in the mid 1980 s harris , lubensky and coworkers ( hl )  @xcite developed a seminal field theoretic model for the unified description of percolating random resistor networks ( rrns ) and a class of diluted continuous spin systems ( such as the @xmath0-@xmath1-model ) .",
    "their approach , based on ideas by stephen  @xcite , turned out to be very fruitful . in the course of the years",
    ", it provided a foundation for the exploration of various critical properties , not only of the @xmath0-@xmath1-model and the rrn  @xcite , but also of random resistor diode networks  @xcite , the swiss cheese model  @xcite and random networks of josephson junctions  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it fostered the computation of several fractal dimensions of isotropic  @xcite and directed  @xcite percolation clusters and aided studying multifractality in isotropic  @xcite and directed  @xcite percolation . also , the hl model helped to improve the understanding of the vulcanization transition  @xcite .",
    "an important role in the hl model is played by the exponent @xmath2 .",
    "it describes the power law behavior of the average resistance @xmath3 between two connected points @xmath0 and @xmath4 at the percolation threshold , @xmath5 here , @xmath6 is the critical exponent of the correlation length @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the probability that controls the dilution of the network and @xmath9 marks the critical point .",
    "originally  @xcite @xmath2 was thought to be the first member , @xmath10 , of an entire family @xmath11 of exponents with the @xmath12th member describing the @xmath12th cumulant of the resistance , @xmath13 the @xmath14 were calculated to one - loop order  @xcite . shortly later",
    "rammal , lemieux , and tremblay  @xcite showed that the higher crossover exponents @xmath15 are irrelevant and that higher cumulants scale as @xmath16 i.e. , they display so called gap scaling .",
    "furthermore , rammal , lemieux , and tremblay argued that the @xmath15 are important for corrections to scaling and specifically that these are governed by exponents @xmath17 .",
    "for example , the average resistance was thought to behave as @xmath18\\ , , \\ ] ] and the conductivity @xmath19 as @xmath20 \\ , .\\ ] ] here , @xmath21 is the conductivity exponent @xmath22 , and @xmath23 and @xmath24 are non - universal amplitudes .    in this paper",
    "we take up the issue of corrections to scaling in rrn anew .",
    "our careful analysis reveals that previous work on this subject is erroneous and that the @xmath15 are meaningless , at least as far as corrections to scaling in rrn are concerned .",
    "it turns out that the previous studies overlooked a crucial feature of irrelevant field theoretic operators , viz .  that they tend to mix under renormalization .",
    "taking this subtlety into account , we calculate corrections to scaling for the average resistance and the conductivity . moreover , we re - examine corrections to scaling in continuous spin models .",
    "due to a difference in the symmetry properties that plays no role for the leading scaling behavior , the corrections to scaling in continuous spin models and rrn are somewhat different .",
    "we determine the correction to scaling exponents for the first cumulant of the spin orientations .",
    "the outline of our paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ hlmodel ] we present a few basics about the rrn and the @xmath0-@xmath1-model .",
    "then we state the field theoretic hamiltonian defining the hl model and sketch its physical contents .",
    "next we collect the irrelevant field theoretic operators that lead to the corrections to scaling we are interested in .",
    "these operators can be classified into 2 groups , viz .",
    "specific operators and general percolation operators .",

    "a particular scaling symmetry of the hamiltonian will be important as we go along .",
    "namely , @xmath71 is invariant under the rescaling @xmath72 because the scaling factor @xmath73 can be absorbed into the redundant parameter @xmath74 .    in the following we use that @xmath75 and",
    "abbreviate the latter integral by @xmath76 .",
    "the approximations involved here become exact in the replica limit .      to fully appreciate the physical contents of the hl model",
    "it is helpful to consider the replica space fourier transform @xmath77 of the order parameter .",
    "for completeness we mention here that the constraint  ( [ constraint ] ) translates upon replica space fourier transform into @xmath78 this constraint is intuitively clear because @xmath79 is a constant and hence does no qualify as an order parameter",

    "the next to leading corrections stem from irrelevant operators which scale as @xmath95 at the upper critical dimension @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is some inverse length scale .",
    "these operators can be classified into two groups .",
    "the first group consist of operators having at least two derivatives with respect to the replica space .",
    "the operators belonging to this group will be referred to as specific operators . in the case of the rrn ,",
    "the specific operators are given by the @xmath70 invariant composite fields    [ ops1 ] @xmath98    each replica space derivative is accompanied by a factor @xmath99 to ensure invariance under the rescaling @xmath72 .",
    "when considering the @xmath0-@xmath1-model , we have to admit all of the hypercubic invariants of @xmath100 rather than of @xmath101 .",
    "thus , we are confronted with a further operator with the naive dimension 8 , namely @xmath102 note that this operator breaks the @xmath70-symmetry in replica space .",
    "as we go along we will see that the family @xmath103 is associated with corrections to scaling of the average resistance and conductivity in rrns .",
    "hence , we refer to this family as resistor specific . the larger family @xmath104 is associated with corrections of the spin orientation cumulants in diluted continuous spin systems .",
    "thus , we say this family is spin specific .",
    "the next group of operators leads to corrections for both pure percolation and the respective specific behavior .",
    "we refer to these operators as general percolation operators .",
    "the pure percolation behavior results from the hl model in the limit @xmath105 .",
    "thus , the second group involves only operators without derivatives with respect to the replica space .",
    "they are given by the @xmath68 invariant composite fields    [ ops3 ] @xmath106    at first sight , three additional general percolation operators with naive dimension eight seem to matter , namely    [ ops4 ] @xmath107    however , these operators can be neglected in calculating corrections to scaling . upon fourier transformation of @xmath108 and @xmath109 one sees that these operators coincide for vanishing external momentum .",
    "thus , it is sufficient foe our purposes to keep @xmath108 .",
    "@xmath110 to @xmath111 are merely total derivatives of lower dimensional operators .",
    "their fourier transformed counterparts are proportional to some ( positive and even ) power of a external momentum and hence these operators can not contribute to a translational invariant hamiltonian .",
    "this situation is similar for @xmath112 .",
    "we choose , though , to keep @xmath112 in our analysis for 2 reasons : ( i ) to exemplify explicitly that this kind of operator does in the end not contribute to the corrections to scaling .",
    "( ii ) based on the scaling symmetries of @xmath113 we can draw exact conclusions on @xmath112 which then can be compared to the results of our explicit 1-loop calculation , i.e. , retaining @xmath112 allows for a later consistency check .",
