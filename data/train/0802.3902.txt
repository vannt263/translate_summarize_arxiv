    "electronic devices with molecules and organic components as active elements offer new limits of device scaling and functionality , and are also of fundamental physical interest . studies at the single molecule level probe the physics of electronic conduction and optical interactions in regimes that have been previously inaccessible .",
    "three - terminal electronic measurements have proven invaluable in many systems , enabling electronic transport to function as a spectroscopy of available states.@xcite while much progress has been made using two - terminal measurements to examine charge transport through molecules@xcite , three - terminal measurements greatly increase the available information in single - molecule measurements .",
    "for example , through the use of a gate electrode it is possible to study conduction as a function of the molecule s redox potential , analogous to what can be done in electrochemical experiments .",
    "a common approach to fabricating three - terminal single - molecule devices is known as the `` electromigration technique '' , in which thermally assisted electromigration is used to create a nanoscale gap in a narrow metallic wire situated on a gate insulator material@xcite .",
    "if a molecule of interest resides in the nanogap , the broken ends of the wires are used as the source and drain contact electrodes , and an underlying conductive substrate can be used as a gate electrode .",
    "the resulting device is a single - molecule transistor ( smt ) .",
    "electromigrated breakjunctions have been used to study transport through individual nanocrystals@xcite , small metal particles@xcite , a variety of molecules@xcite , and even individual atoms@xcite .",
    "a central hurdle in most single - molecule electronic measurements is to demonstrate unambiguously that transport is occurring through only a single molecule of interest .",
    "this is complicated by the lack of direct imaging techniques with sufficient resolution , except for the two - terminal example of scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) , which allows imaging with atomic resolution on conducting substrates . in this paper",
    "we review smt fabrication ( section  [ fab ] ) , and then discuss device characterization based on electronic transport alone as a diagnostic ( section  [ transport ] ) . in that circumstance",
    "it is necessary to search for features characteristic of conduction through a single molecule in addition to attributes uniquely identifying the molecule of interest .",
    "generally the search for single molecule devices requires a statistical approach and many control experiments .",
    "exciting recent work ( section  [ optical ] ) demonstrates that simultaneous single - molecule optical spectroscopy and transport is possible . in such measurements surface - enhanced raman spectroscopy ( sers ) can give _ the vibrational spectrum of the specific molecule through which transport is taking place_. we present new data using nonlinear transport and optical rectification to arrive at a quantitative estimate for the local optical field experienced by the molecule under illumination .",
    "fabrication begins with the preparation of arrays of devices on an @xmath0 si substrate with a 200 nm sio@xmath1 insulating layer .",
    "1 nm of ti and 15 nm of au are evaporated onto nanowire patterns defined by electron beam lithography .",
    "bowtie - shaped constriction patterns are produced with minimum widths of approximately 100  nm ( figure [ semimage]a ) .",
    "additional gold pads for contacting the source and drain electrodes are also defined by electron beam lithography .",
    "the array of samples is cleaned in solvents then exposed to an oxygen plasma for 1 min to remove trace organics .",
    "the molecules are dispersed for approximately monolayer coverage , or allowed to self - assemble onto the au surface , depending on the molecule in question .",
    "electromigration ( with some thermal enhancement due to joule heating ) is used to break the constriction into distinct source and drain electrodes , with the intent that the molecule will reside in the resulting nanoscale gap .",
    "this process has been studied extensively by a number of investigators@xcite . at large current densities in the constriction ,",
    "the electrons transfer sufficient momentum to the lattice to move atoms at the surface and at grain boundaries . as a constriction",
    "is formed the local current density increases , leading to a runaway migration and the formation of an interelectrode gap .",
    "elevated local temperatures enhance the rate of this process through the increased diffusion of metal atoms . to mitigate concerns about adsorbed contaminants we prefer to electromigrate junctions at low temperatures in a cryopumped ultrahigh vacuum ( uhv ) environment , though this has not been possible in the optical experiments discussed in section  [ optical ] .",
    "the critical gap size , defined as the minimum separation between the two resulting electrodes , is typically 1 - 3  nm . with good , reproducible lithography to produce the constrictions and an appropriate electromigration procedure",
    ", yields of such small gaps can exceed 90% .",
    "prior to electromigration .",
    "inset shows a magnified sem image of a similar nanowire after the breaking procedure .",
    "( b ) ideal device configuration after the electromigration process is complete for a c@xmath2-based junction.,width=8 ]    an assortment of voltage ramping techniques have been utilized by different research groups in an effort to form the smallest , cleanest , and most consistently - sized nanogaps@xcite .",
    "all techniques involve minimizing the series resistance to avoid overheating and subsequent melting of a nanowire ; and an immediate reduction in applied bias across the break after the gap has opened in order to avoid creating an excessively large interelectrode spacing .",
    "we have found success with a feedback controlled method of repeatedly ramping the source - drain voltage , @xmath3 .",
    "the desired final device configuration is shown schematically in figure [ semimage]b .",
    "subtle differences in junction configuration down to the ngstrm level can strongly influence device properties .",
    "the wkb approximation dictates that the current through a metal - vacuum - metal gap decreases by roughly a factor of @xmath4 ( @xmath57.4 ) for every ngstrm increase in the size of the vacuum gap@xcite .",
    "this exponential dependence of tunneling on interelectrode distance ensures , as in an stm , that the tunneling electrons probe a volume containing at most one or two molecules .",
    "precisely how molecules that begin on the surface of the constriction end up in the interelectrode gap is not known .",
    "the inherent randomness in the device formation process leads to many electrode - molecule configurations and resulting electrical conduction characteristics for any group of devices .",
    "historically this has mandated a statistical approach to device characterization based on transport . by analysis of the transport data , as explained below , it is often possible to infer the number of molecules in the tunneling region and the relative couplings of the molecule to the source and drain electrodes .",
    "details about molecular positioning and bonding remains unavailable , though new measurements such as those in sect .",
    "[ optical ] contain much information .",
    "the differential conductance , @xmath6 , as a function of @xmath3 , calculated or measured using quasi - dc techniques , is the main transport tool to assess the nature of a given device .",
    "there are four main classes of differential conductance traces , with characteristic abundances determined by examining large numbers ( thousands ) of junctions@xcite ( though these vary depending on molecule type ) .",
    "1 ) devices with no measurable differential conductance indicate an interelectrode breakjunction gap that is too large for measurable conduction by tunneling ( @xmath7% ) .",
    "2 ) devices with a weakly nonlinear conductance plot wherein @xmath6 drops around @xmath3 = 0 , but does not form a clear blockaded region denote breakjunctions with small to moderately sized gaps , but without an active element within the nanogap ( figure [ blockades2]a , @xmath8% ) .",
    "3 ) devices that show a region of zero conductance bordered by sharp peaks most likely have a gap containing a molecule or small particle ( figure [ blockades2]b , percentage depends strongly on molecule type ) .",
    "4 ) devices with a zero - bias resonance suggest a stronger molecule - electrode coupling ( percentage depends strongly on molecule type , ranging from zero for alkane chains to several percent for transition metal complexes containing unpaired @xmath9 electrons@xcite ) .    further investigation is required to identify those devices that contain a single molecule of interest .",
    "confounding possibilities include surface contaminants , metal grains produced during the electromigration process , or simply more than one molecule of interest .",
    "as explained below , the observed gate dependence of conduction and an understanding of the relevant transport physics has enabled progress in eliminating spurious devices",
    ". the final yield of gateable likely smts is typically 10 - 15% of the starting devices , based on a total sample size of thousands of devices .      in analogy to conventional single - electron transistors ,",
    "the smt can be thought of as consisting of 6 parts : source , drain and gate electrodes , the molecule , and the tunneling connections to the source and drain .",
    "the tunneling barriers are established by the geometry and chemistry of the molecule / electrode interface .",
    "we assume that the polarizability of the complex is much larger than that of the insulating barriers ; therefore the voltage drops on the barriers are proportional to their respective coupling strengths @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "elementary transport characteristics can be calculated by treating tunneling barriers as a capacitive and a resistive element@xcite .",
    "the positive and negative slopes of the blockaded region ( the tunneling thresholds ) are determined by the ratios @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively@xcite ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are the capacitances between the molecule - gate , molecule - drain , and molecule - source electrodes )",
    ".    traces of @xmath6 measured as a function of @xmath3 , obtained within a range of incrementally changing gate voltage , @xmath17 , can be compiled to form a map known as a stability diagram , illustrating where tunneling is both allowed and prohibited .",
    "not all devices exhibiting a zero - bias resonance or a conductance gap will show dependence on applied gate bias , @xmath18 .",
    "this poor gate coupling may occur as a result of the detailed device geometry or possibly as a result of the orientation of the active element within the breakjunction gap@xcite .",
    "stability diagrams of devices that _ do _ exhibit gate dependence are a primary means of displaying pertinent transport data reflecting important aspects of smt behavior .    in equilibrium",
    "the source and drain electrodes have a common electrochemical potential , @xmath19 , the fermi level .",
    "when the source and drain electrodes are biased such that the source electrode has a chemical potential @xmath20 and the drain electrode has chemical potential @xmath21 , current will flow as long as the coulomb charging energy ( @xmath22 ) and the discrete energy level spacing ( @xmath23 ) have been overcome , and an energy level of the molecule lies between @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( at finite temp , this range is extended by the thermal energy @xmath24@xcite ) .",
    "this current flow is due to resonant tunneling of electrons from the source to the lowest available single particle state producing a @xmath6 peak at the edge of the conductance gap ( figure [ tunneling1]c ) .",
    "gate voltage shifts the active element levels with respect to @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the resulting stability diagram is determined by both the active element s spectrum and its capacitive couplings to the source , drain , and gate electrodes .",
    "when the active element has a negligible single - particle level spacing ( _ e.g. _ , a few - nm metal grain ) , the discrete spectrum seen in transport arises purely from @xmath22 , the coulomb repulsion that must be overcome to add another electron to the element .",
    "the result is a series of regularly spaced diamonds in the stability diagram , and the suppressed conduction in the absence of a discrete level available for transport is called coulomb blockade .",
    "each diamond region represents a different charge state of the particle ( _ i.e. _ a stable region of fixed average electron number ) . in this case",
    "the electron addition energy depends upon the classical capacitance of the particle , including interactions with the electrodes .",
    "frequently the single - particle electronic level spacing , @xmath23 , can not be neglected when considering transport .",
    "if the island is a molecule such as c@xmath2 , the discrete energy level spacing between single particle energy states at equilibrium occurs between the highest occupied molecular orbital level ( homo level ) and the lowest unoccupied molecule orbital level ( lumo level ) , commonly called the homo - lumo gap .",
    "we can see from equation ( 1 ) that the size of the coulomb diamond centered around @xmath25 depends on both the coulomb charging energy as well as the magnitude of the homo - lumo gap .",
    "@xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 is the slope of the diamonds , and @xmath29 is the voltage spacing between successive charge states .",
    "@xmath30 where @xmath23 is the spacing between two discrete energy levels ( e.g. the homo - lumo gap ) , and @xmath31 is the bare coulomb charging energy , @xmath22 .    unlike metal particles",
    ", most molecules have a very limited number of accessible charge states , which do not typically appear with even spacing .",
    "solution - based electrochemistry ( e.g. cyclic voltammetry ) demonstrates that molecules have a limited number of accessible valence states.@xcite if one finds that it is possible to add many electrons to a potential device via gating , or if the spacing between charge state transitions is highly regular , it is extremely unlikely that the active region of the potential device contains a single small molecule .     vs @xmath3 demonstrating a device exhibiting conduction in the `` weakly nonlinear '' regime .",

    "( c ) stability diagram of a device with clear gate dependence .",
    "black represent zero conductance and white represents 0.003 @xmath32 . from equation 1 , the charging energy is approximately 20 mev .",
    "the small charging energy along with the high number of accessible charge states indicates that the active element is not a single molecule of interest , but rather a metal particle .",

    "this provides a means of assessing whether tunneling is occurring through multiple molecules .",
    "when scrutinizing a potential smt with a clear blockaded region , one must also look at the electron addition energy ( the max source - drain bias of the blockaded region ) , which should be of a sensible size for the molecule in question .",
    "the classical capacitance of a molecule is so small that an electrostatic charging energy over 100  mev is not unreasonable , even without taking into account molecular level spacing .",
    "some characteristics in stability diagrams may uniquely identify an smt made with a particular molecule . at sufficiently high source drain bias",
    ", an electron may tunnel from the source into an _ excited _ single particle state of the island ( figure [ tunneling1]d ) . additional @xmath6 peaks that parallel",
    "the edges of the blockaded diamonds in stability diagrams appear beyond the edge of the conductance gap when tunneling occurs through newly accessible quantized excitations .",
    "the location of each @xmath6 peak outside the conductance gap provides information on the excitation spectrum of a smt .",
    "the conductance gap disappears ( ordinarily ) at the charge degeneracy point , @xmath34 , where the total energy of the system is the same for two different charge states of the molecule . when the gate voltage passes v@xmath35 as it is ramped in the positive direction , the average number of charges on the molecule changes by one electron .",
    "the absolute equilibrium electron population , @xmath36 , is determined by @xmath18 , molecule / electrode interfacial charge transfer , and the local charge distribution around the molecule .",
    "unfortunately , @xmath36 can not be determined solely from the data obtained in the stability diagram .",
    "each @xmath6 peak on the @xmath37 side of a stability diagram represents an opening of a new tunneling pathway where an electron tunnels onto the @xmath36-electron state , for example , to transiently generate the @xmath38-electron ground or excited states . in this way , the peaks probe the excitation energies of the molecule .",
    "conversely , each @xmath6 peak that appears at @xmath39 probes the ground and excited states of the @xmath36-electron molecule@xcite .",
    "the energy of these quantized excitations can be determined from the source / drain voltage at which they intercept the conductance gap . _",
    "if these excitations can be identified with known molecular properties , they can serve as a fingerprint for molecular identification .",
    "_    higher - order tunneling events known as cotunneling may be observed inside the coulomb blockade region of an smt when the overall tunneling current is very small .",
    "cotunneling becomes more apparent as the coupling between the dot and leads is enhanced , and can give rise to the non - zero current inside the blockaded region .",
    "elastic cotunneling corresponds to an electron tunneling into and out of the same energy level , such that the molecule remains in its ground state ( fig [ tunneling1]e ) .",
    "inelastic cotunneling occurs when an electron enters and exits the molecule through two different energy levels , ultimately leaving the molecule in an excited state .",
    "when @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the energy level spacing between the ground state and the first excited state , inelastic cotunneling processes can occur ( figure   [ tunneling1]f)@xcite .",
    "cotunneling events are only weakly affected by @xmath18 and can be most clearly seen in a stability diagram mapping @xmath42 .",

    "if the pattern of excitations is identical for multiple charge states of a given molecule ( i.e. excitation are observed on both sides of @xmath44 at the same value of @xmath3 ) this suggests that the excitations are not associated with molecular charge states and are therefore independent of the electronic configuration . additionally , if excitation energies are equally spaced then their origin is also unlikely to be excited electronic charge states .    as long as the exact structure of a molecule is known , its vibrational modes can be computed , and further calculations can demonstrate that only some of these modes are plausible candidates for excitation peaks observed in stability diagrams.@xcite for instance ,",
    "experimental and theoretical studies of c@xmath2 show that the lowest energy internal vibrational mode energy @xmath45 33  mev and corresponds to the deformation of the buckminsterfullerene sphere into a prolate ellipsoid.@xcite similar considerations have been used to distinguish a known vibrational mode in c@xmath46.@xcite in addition it is also possible to excite a center - of - mass oscillation of a molecule ( commonly known as the bouncing ball mode ) within the confinement potential that binds it to the electrode surface@xcite .",
    "an additional higher - order tunneling process that is apparent in many smt devices is the formation of a many - body kondo resonance .",
    "this phenomenon has studied in semiconductor quantum dots@xcite and smts@xcite .",
    "observing the kondo effect requires an unpaired electron to exist in the active element . in the framework of the anderson single level impurity model",
    ", the active element is then an effective magnetic impurity@xcite with the singly occupied level s energy , @xmath47 , below the source / drain fermi level ( figure [ kondo1]a ) . because of the coulomb interaction",
    ", it is classically forbidden to bring the electron out of the impurity without adding energy into the system .",
    "however , higher order tunneling processes can take place such that another electron from the source / drain electrode fermi sea may exchange with the local moment . at low temperatures",
    "the coherent superposition of all possible cotunneling events results in the screening of the local spin ; the resulting ground state is a correlated many - body singlet state spanning the source , impurity , and drain . this kondo resonance is manifested as a conductance peak at the fermi energy ( @xmath48 ) .    the kondo temperature , @xmath49 , is the characteristic temperature associated with the formation of the kondo singlet .",
    "the characteristic energy scale @xmath50 is exponentially dependent on @xmath51 , the intrinsic width of the single particle level , by the relation@xcite @xmath52 outside the mixed valence regime ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "the total width @xmath54 is dictated by the overlap between the single particle state and the conduction electron states of the source and drain . therefore @xmath51 is in turn exponentially sensitive to the precise molecule - electrode configuration .",
    "this indicates both that a kondo resonance will only be found in devices with relatively strong molecule - electrode coupling , and for smts displaying a kondo resonance , the overall conductance level will be significantly increased with respect to similar smts in the coulomb blockade regime . in a symmetric system , as @xmath55 , the smt will approach its theoretical maximum conductance @xmath56 .",
    "it is possible that a relatively high kondo temperature can be associated with a device exhibiting a lower conductance as the total conductance is determined by the smaller of @xmath10 and @xmath11 while @xmath57 is determined by the total @xmath51 .    .",

    "a fit to the semiempirical expression for the spin-@xmath60 kondo resonance related to maximum conductance , @xmath61 where @xmath62 , or to the full width at half max @xmath63 allows extraction of the corresponding kondo temperature , @xmath49 .",
    "measurements of @xmath64 or fwhm as a function of @xmath58 that can not be fit to these expressions likely indicate a zero - bias resonance that does not originate from a kondo state .",
    "zeeman splitting of the zero - bias resonance in an applied magnetic field can also be used to determine the magnetic nature of molecular state , and hence to corroborate the presence of a kondo state .",
    "finally , we always attempt to verify that the measured stability diagrams can be seen to transition from the kondo regime to the coulomb blockade regime .",
    "this evidence that charge state of the device can be altered with the gate together with the data from the tunneling thresholds of the potential smt in the coulomb regime will further attest to the nature of the device .",
    "the kondo effect can be an additional `` fingerprint '' used to identify molecular states .",
    "gate dependence of the kondo resonance in smts has proven to be weaker than that seen in semiconductor dots@xcite , and `` satellite '' peaks associated with kondo physics in the presence of molecular vibrations have been observed@xcite .",
    "also , since only odd occupancy charge states can exhibit the kondo effect , the presence of a zero - bias resonance can be used to help identify specific charge states .",
    "care must still be exercised , however : zero - bias resonances that do not result from the kondo effect may occur in some devices , while devices believed to contain metal nanoclusters@xcite can exhibit the kondo effect in the absence of molecules .",

    "following electromigration , we observe a sers response strongly localized to the resulting gaps .",
    "successive spectra measured directly over the sers hotspot revealed `` blinking '' and spectral diffusion , phenomena often associated with single- or few - molecule raman sensitivity .",
    "blinking occurs when the raman spectrum rapidly changes on the second time scale with the amplitudes of different modes changing independently of one another .",
    "spectral shifts as large as @xmath66  @xmath65 were observed , making it difficult to directly compare sers spectra with other published results . blinking and",
    "spectral shifts are attributed to movement or rearrangement of the molecule relative to the metallic substrate .",

    "more recently , we have performed simultaneous sers and transport measurements@xcite , including raman microscope observations over the center of nanogap devices during electromigration .",
    "molecules of interest , pma or a fluorinated oligimer ( fope ) , were assembled on the au surface prior to electromigration .",

    "the ac current and its second harmonic were measured with lock - in amplifiers and the dc current was measured at 5.0  khz using a daq .",
    "simultaneously raman spectra were acquired with a 1  s integration time .",
    "optical measurements during electromigration provide a wealth of information about the plasmonic properties of nanogaps .",

    "the large shift in wave numbers ( over 100  @xmath65 between the bulk and normal and almost 300  @xmath65 for the greatest shift ) indicates significant interactions between the molecule and either the substrate or other adsorbates , and is cause for further investigation .    recalling that conduction in nanogaps",
    "is dominated by approximately a single molecular volume , the observed correlations between conductance and raman measurements strongly indicate that the nanogaps have single molecule raman sensitivity .",

    "resonant optical effects@xcite and photon - assisted tunneling@xcite are potential sources of dc optically - driven currents in molecular junctions .",
    "however , we find that the optically - driven dc currents are relatively independent of molecule type , with similar data sets collected in devices using , for example , pma molecules , fope molecules , and adsorbed atmospheric contaminants .",
    "this strongly suggests that the mechanism behind these optically - driven currents is a general feature of the electromigrated junction structure , rather than tied to specific molecular features .",
