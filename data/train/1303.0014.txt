    "it remains to prove , and for this it suffices to show that @xmath563 indeed , using the montel theorem choose a sequence @xmath564 ( @xmath565 as @xmath566 ) convergent to a holomorphic function @xmath567 . as @xmath187 is the only root of @xmath546 , we get @xmath568 and hence @xmath569 , what let us easily derive .",
    "the statement follows from the following claim : @xmath570 indeed , assume and fix @xmath571 .",
    "let @xmath17 and let @xmath572 be taken as above for @xmath573 .",
    "the function @xmath574 has no roots in @xmath575 , because @xmath576 for @xmath577 .",
    "moreover , @xmath578 ( the last integral is just the index at @xmath187 of the curve @xmath579 , equal to @xmath187 by ) , so @xmath574 has only one root in @xmath32 ( counting with multiplicities ) .",
    "denote this root by @xmath580 .",
    "we have the function @xmath581 such that @xmath582 , so we only need to show that it is holomorphic .    fix @xmath583 and let @xmath584 be as in .",
    "again , @xmath574 has no roots in @xmath575 for @xmath585 , so @xmath586 .",
    "as @xmath580 is the only root of @xmath574 and it belongs to @xmath587 , we have the formula @xmath588 what implies that @xmath589 is holomorphic in @xmath590 . as @xmath591 is arbitrary , we obtain @xmath592 .    it remains to show .",
    "fix @xmath571 and @xmath583 . for @xmath585 and @xmath132",
    "we have @xmath593-\\epsilon.\\ ] ] the second term of the right hand side tends uniformly ( w.r.t @xmath585 ) to @xmath187 as @xmath594 , and the first term is non - positive .",
