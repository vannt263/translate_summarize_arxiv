    "quantum theory is one of the most important branches in physics and is well know for being counter - intuitive and its bizarre phenomena ( nothing like we experience in everyday life )",
    ". quantum entanglement , which is the direct consequence of the epr paradox @xcite , is a very unique phenomenon and has no classical counterparts .",
    "since the discovery of quantum entanglement , a wide range of applications has been proposed , i.e. , quantum cryptography , quantum teleportation and superdense coding @xcite .",
    "these applications indicate that entanglement could be exploited to preform the impossible tasks which can not be done by classical computers . here",
    "is another new branch of physics , which is called quantum information and computing , has been born by joining quantum physics and theoretical computer science . in this respect many solid state systems , especially quantum dots ,",
    "have been proposed as promising hardwares to perform quantum information processors @xcite .",
    "the main difficulty of studying many - body solid state system is the complexity .",
    "the approximation methods must be introduced to obtain physical properties , see @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study the entanglement @xcite of the ground state of two - body systems using feynman path integral @xcite",
    ". we will concentrate on the entanglement generated by the spatial degrees of freedom and use a coupled harmonic oscillator as a toy model .",
    "the feynman path integral method will be used to compute the density matrix of the composite system ( bipartite system ) .",
    "this provides the way to quantify the entanglement by calculating the linear entropy @xcite .",
    "the organisation of this paper is the following . in sect .",
    "[ sec:2 ] we introduce the toy model : a coupled harmonic oscillator and how to compute the density matrix .",
    "then , the linear entropy will be briefly discussed and will be used to quantify the spatial entanglement of the system in sect .",
    "[ sec:3 ] . and",
    "the last section will be devoted to summary and discussions .",
    "consider the coupled harmonic oscillator as show in fig .  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "the particle with mass @xmath1 is trapped in the harmonic potential with frequency @xmath2 .",
    "the particle with mass @xmath3 vibrates around its equilibrium with angular frequency @xmath4 .",
    "the interaction between these two particles is modeled by hooke s law and @xmath5 denotes the strength of the interaction .",
    "the lagrangian is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the position of the mass @xmath1 , @xmath8 is the position of the mass @xmath3 and @xmath9 is time .",
    "the propagator of the composite system is then given by @xmath10 where the action is given by @xmath11 we consider the case of the imaginary time : @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 is temperature and @xmath15 is boltzmann constant  @xcite .",
    "the propagator eq .   becomes the density matrix .",

    "the entanglement generated by the continuous spatial degree of freedom is expected to depend on the interplay between the strength of the confining potential and interaction . then we are interested to investigate how the spatial entanglement changes with the system parameter .    the linear entropy of the reduced density matrix @xmath21 where @xmath22 is used to measure the entanglement for a pure state and continuous case . for the continuous variable case ,",
    "@xmath23 can be computed by @xmath24 and @xmath25 the system would be completely disentangled where @xmath26 . on the other hand ,",

    "let us , we consider for the case that @xmath4 becomes very large .",
    "we obtain    @xmath35 and @xmath36    obviously , the confining parameter @xmath0 solely depends on the strength of the variable @xmath4 . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath4 becomes infinitesimally small , we obtain    @xmath37 and @xmath38    in this case we see that confining parameter depends on the strength of the interaction . from these results",
    "we can adjust the entanglement between particle mass @xmath1 and particle mass @xmath3 by tuning the strength of @xmath0 with vibrating frequency @xmath4 and coupling constant @xmath5 .            in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] shows the numerical results of how @xmath39 changes with respect to @xmath0 .",
    "it is clear the spatial entanglement increases when the confining potential @xmath0 decreases .",
    "this is because the spatial separation between @xmath1 and @xmath3 increases due to low confining potential and hence @xmath39 increases @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] , the confining potential @xmath0 is fixed while the interaction strength @xmath5 is varied .",
    "it is found that the spatial entanglement increases with the strength of the interaction .",
    "we have studied the spatial entanglement through the linear entropy for the coupled harmonic oscillator .",
    "the density matrix of the system could be exactly computed by using feynman path integral approach .",
    "we obtain the condition on system parameters for maximally entangled and completely disentangled state . the system in sect .",
    "[ sec:2 ] can be extended by adding more of particles with mass @xmath3 .",
    "then this can be viewed as the particles with @xmath3 constitute the lattice structure while the particle with mass @xmath1 is the charge moving through the lattice . the spatial entanglement between the charge ( particle with mass @xmath1 ) and the lattice ( particle with mass @xmath3 )",
    "could possibly be studied using the same technique in this paper .",
    "furthermore , this method could also possible be used to study the entanglement in polaron systems .",
