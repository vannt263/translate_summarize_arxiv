    "analytic calculation of the time evolution in two - level systems has been studied by a number of authors for a long time since the beginning years of quantum mechanics  @xcite .",
    "these results have been applied to various areas of physics including quantum optics , laser spectroscopy , nuclear magnetic resonance and atomic collisions  @xcite .",
    "the importance of the study of quantum time - evolution is still increasing even now ; for example , much attention has been paid recently to the quantum manipulation of qubits  @xcite and magnetization process of magnetic molecules with large spin  @xcite .",
    "recent rapid development of computers has enabled massive numerical simulation of quantum dynamics .",
    "nevertheless , it remains to be important to study analytically solvable models for the following reasons : ( 1 ) in some ranges of physical parameters the numerical simulation becomes too difficult , and ( 2 ) analytic solutions give a clearer description about parameter dependence .",
    "analytic solutions of quantum dynamics can be classified into several classes .",
    "some of them are obtained by using hypergeometric functions .",
    "this was first found by rosen and zener  @xcite , which has then been generalized by several authors  @xcite . in these studies ,",
    "the time - variable @xmath1 is generally transformed into another real variable @xmath2 , which varies from @xmath3 to @xmath4 monotonically .",
    "then , the schrdinger equation of two - level systems can be reduced to the hypergeometric differential equation , and the transition probability can be related to the connection problem between two pairs of fundamental solutions around @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "one exception is the approach by carroll and hioe  @xcite .",
    "they have studied two solvable classes , and in one of them they have introduced a new variable @xmath7 changing from @xmath8 to @xmath9 as @xmath1 increases and have reduced the schrdinger equation to the riemann - papperitz equation .",
    "recently , ishkhanyan has pointed out that the carroll - hioe model can be understood in terms of the hypergeometric functions by considering a complex - valued path @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a real variable  @xcite . by this complex - valued path",
    ", ishkhanyan also found a new solvable class , but he did not obtain results for the transition probability .    in this paper , we show that for the complex - valued path , the transition probability can be calculated efficiently from the ` monodromy ' matrices of the corresponding differential equations .",
    "monodromy is one of the global properties of differential equations , and has attracted much attention by mathematicians , for example , through the deep connection with the painlev equations  @xcite .",
    "hence , we expect that the monodromy approach is valuable not only because it enables one to calculate the transition probability for various models but also because it establishes a connection between physical phenomena and global features of differential equations .    in this paper , as a concrete example , we mainly consider the following time - dependent two - level schrdinger equation and obtain the transition probability using the monodromy associated with the solution : @xmath12 where the matrix elements are given by @xmath13 here , the coefficients , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , are assumed to be real constants .",
    "this is one of the solvable class reported by ishkhanyan  @xcite .",
    "however , the transition probability for the model has not been obtained .",
    "it should be noted that this model is equivalent to the rosen - zener model  @xcite in the case @xmath17 , is a constant , while @xmath18 has a sech - type pulse form .",
    "this hamiltonian , however , is reformed by a proper unitary transformation of the wave function to coincide with the present model . ] and that it also includes the special case of the second demkov - kunike model  @xcite in the case @xmath19 .",
    "hence , this model can give a smooth connection between the two known results .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "we give the relation between the transition probability and the monodromy of the hypergeometric function in ",
    "[ sec : monodromy ] , and the transition probability is calculated explicitly in   [ sec : calculation ] .",
    "the extension to the multi - level problems is addressed in   [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "finally , the results are summarized in   [ sec : summary ] . in [ app : class ] , we describe the generalization of the present model and its relationship to the carroll - hioe s model .",
    "the diagonal elements in the model ( [ eq : sch ] ) are eliminated by the following change of variables : @xmath20 then , the schrdinger equation is expressed as @xmath21 by combining these two equations , we obtain the second - order differential equations for @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively as @xmath24 it should be noted that the equation for @xmath23 is obtained by replacing @xmath25 by @xmath26 in ( [ eq:2nd - c1 ] ) .",
    "hence , once the solution of the equation for @xmath22 is obtained , the solution for @xmath23 is easily obtained by reversing the sign of the parameters in @xmath25 .",
    "the above discussion is general .",
    "now , we consider the specific model given by ( [ eq : eps ] ) and ( [ eq : v ] ) . by substituting these specific forms of @xmath25 and @xmath18 into ( [ eq:2nd - c1 ] ) and adopting the change of variable as @xmath27 equation ( [ eq:2nd - c1 ] )",
    "can be reduced to the differential equation of the hypergeometric function  @xcite , @xmath28 here , the parameters , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , are determined as @xmath32 in the same way , equation ( [ eq:2nd - c2 ] ) is reduced to the hypergeometric differential equation with the parameters @xmath33 as already mentioned , these parameters are obtained by replacing @xmath14 and @xmath15 by @xmath34 and @xmath35 respectively in ( [ eq : alpha])-([eq : gamma ] ) . in the following calculation , related to the calculation for @xmath23 ,",
    "the prime indicates that it is obtained by reversing the sign of @xmath14 and @xmath15 from the original quantity without the prime .    from ( [ eq : zt ] )",
    ", it can be easily seen that the variable @xmath36 as @xmath37 .",
    "hence , for discussion about the initial state it is convenient to consider the fundamental solutions around @xmath38 as @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are expressed in terms of the hypergeometric functions as @xmath42 with similar definitions for @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "since @xmath29 and @xmath30 are pure - imaginary in the present model , we have to choose @xmath45 to determine the branch . in this paper , we choose @xmath46 in order to decide the initial state , it is sufficient to study the limit @xmath36 , in which case we obtain @xmath47 from ( [ eq : zt ] ) , ( [ eq : c1-inf2 ] ) and ( [ eq : c2-inf2 ] ) , @xmath48 s and @xmath49 s are determined .    to obtain the transition probability , we assume that the initial state is the ground state of the hamiltonian in the limit @xmath50 , @xmath51 it may be noted that the off - diagonal elements in ( [ eq : ham  inf ] ) do not vanish .",
    "consequently the ground state wavefunction does not correspond to @xmath52 and @xmath53 as it appears in the usual models .",
    "the time - evolution of the ground - state wave function is obtained generally as @xmath54 where @xmath55 the solution ( [ eq : a - evinf ] ) includes an arbitary phase factor @xmath56 , which is chosen zero in this paper . from ( [ eq : a - evinf ] ) , the time - evolutions of @xmath22 and @xmath23 in the limit @xmath57 can be easily evaluated as @xmath58 where the phase factors are given as @xmath59 by using ( [ eq : zt ] ) and by comparing ( [ eq : c1t - inf])-([eq : c2t - inf ] ) with ( [ eq : c1-inf2])-([eq : c2-inf2 ] ) , the constants , @xmath48 s and @xmath49 s are determined as @xmath60 where the phase factors , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , are given as @xmath63 though these are not relevant to the calculation of the transition probability .    by the choice of the initial condition , the time - evolution has been described only by the fundamental solution @xmath64 around @xmath65 .",
    "to be more accurate , around @xmath66 ( corresponding to @xmath50 ) denoted by the point p in fig .",
    "[ fig : path ]  ( a ) , the solution is given by @xmath67 on the other hand , the final state is given by the solution of the hypergeometric differential equation around @xmath68 ( corresponding to @xmath69 ) denoted by the point q in fig .",
    "[ fig : path ]  ( a ) .",
    "the path @xmath7 in the complex plane is also drawn in fig .",
    "[ fig : path ] .",
    "then , the solution around the point q analytically continued from the point p does not equal to ( [ eq : pointpc1 ] ) and ( [ eq : pointpc2 ] ) ; the solution is expressed as linear combinations of the fundamental solutions around @xmath38 .",
    "this is crucial to the calculation of the transition probability .    in order to make the situation clearer ,",
    "let us deform the path of @xmath70 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : path ]  ( b ) . in this deformed path ,",
    "the analytic continuation of the solution is divided into two parts , @xmath71 and @xmath72 . here",
    ", the path @xmath71 denotes a round trip to the singular point at @xmath73 , while the path @xmath72 is a half round trip around @xmath38 in the clockwise direction .",
    "the analytic continuation along the path @xmath72 is easily performed , and determined only by the fundamental solutions around @xmath38 . on the other hand ,",
    "the analytic continuation along the path @xmath71 is nontrivial , and determined by the global character of the differential equation called the ` monodromy ' .",
    "the monodromy is expressed by the monodromy matrices as @xmath74 where @xmath75 denotes the analytic continuation along the path @xmath71 .",
    "denoting the matrix elements of @xmath76 and @xmath77 as @xmath78 the solutions around the point q can be expressed by @xmath79 here , as shown below , the first ( second ) term in the final entries of ( [ eq : c1-connect ] ) and ( [ eq : c2-connect ] ) corresponds to the excited ( ground ) state in the limit @xmath80 .",
    "hence , in the calculation of the transition probability , only the element @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) is relevant .",
    "this matrix element is calculated explicitly in the next section .",
    "the path along which the analytic continuation is performed ; ( a ) the original path and ( b ) deformed path.,width=283 ]    let us end this section by deriving the formula for the transition probability , using the monodromy matrix elements . in the limit @xmath80 , the equations , ( [ eq : c1-connect ] ) and ( [ eq : c2-connect ] ) , are evaluated as @xmath83 here , we have suppressed the second term corresponding to the ground state . from these equations , the components of the wave function @xmath84",

    "the remaining task is to calculate the elements of the monodromy matrices .",
    "one may identify several ways to calculate the monodromy matrices of the hypergeometric differential equations  @xcite . here , we briefly explain the simplest way .    to determine the monodromy matrix ,",
    "it is crucial to use the integral representation of the hypergeometric function . by defining the integral @xmath94",
    "the following relations hold : @xmath95 where @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 denote the fundamental solutions of the hypergeometric differential equations around @xmath99 , respectively . here , the constants , @xmath100 s , depend only on @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , and their explicit expressions are irrelevant to the present calculation . by applying the cauchy s theorem to the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : integral ] ) , the following linear relations may be identified : @xmath101 where @xmath102 . by eliminating @xmath103 and @xmath104",
    ", we obtain @xmath105 on the other hand , since the solution pair @xmath106 is related to the fundamental solutions around @xmath6 , the monodromy matrix for this pair is easily obtained as @xmath107 combining ( [ eq : q ] ) and ( [ eq : gamma ] ) , the monodromy matrix for @xmath106 is given as @xmath108 this result is easily related to the fundamental solutions , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , by ( [ eq : int - inf ] ) as @xmath109 by comparing the above with the original monodromy matrix ( [ eq : orig - mono ] ) along with ( [ eq : orig - ele ] ) , we finally obtain @xmath110 ( @xmath111 ) .",
