    "in the last ten years much work has been done on the calculation of the beta functions of gravity , using wilsonian renormalization group methods .",
    "such calculations have focused first on the hilbert action , usually including also a cosmological term @xcite , and have been extended to include terms quadratic in curvature @xcite as well as higher polynomials in the ricci scalar @xcite or in some approximation even all orders of the derivative expansion @xcite .",
    "similar studies have also been done in the conformal reduction of gravity , where only the conformal factor is dynamical @xcite . the main motivation for this work has been to try",
    "to ( dis)prove the asymptotic safety of gravity , _ i.e. _ the existence of a fixed point with finitely many uv attractive directions @xcite , also @xcite for reviews .",
    "one slightly bothering aspect of these calculations is that very often one works with quantities that are scheme - dependent , _",
    "i.e. _ depend on details of how one chooses to implement a cutoff .",
    "scheme dependence is nothing new in quantum field theory .",
    "it is usually taken as a sign that the quantity one is calculating is not directly measurable .",
    "the leading approximation to the beta functions of dimensionless coupling constants , such as yang - mills and yukawa couplings in four dimensions is scheme - independent . in the case of gravity",
    "the most interesting couplings , like newton s constant and the cosmological constant are dimensionful and their beta functions are scheme dependent even in the lowest approximation .",
    "one hopes that at least the qualitative features of the renormalization group ( rg ) flow are scheme independent .",
    "for example , the existence of a fixed point ( fp ) as well as the number of attractive / repulsive directions at the fp should be scheme - independent .",
    "more quantitatively , one expects also the critical exponents at the fp to be scheme - independent .",
    "all the calculations performed so far support the existence of a fp with finitely many attractive directions .",
    "for pure gravity the number of attractive directions seems likely to be three @xcite , in accordance with the idea of asymptotic safety . at a quantitative level , when using a truncation , both the position of the fp and the critical exponents depend on the scheme , but there are some quantities , such as the dimensionless combination @xmath0 which are much less sensitive to cutoff scheme than others .",
    "here we add some tassels to this picture .",
    "we consider a class of cutoff schemes that have not received much attention in the literature , that we call `` pure '' .",
    "we say that a cutoff is `` pure '' if it does not depend on any of the parameters ( masses , wave function renormalizations , couplings ... ) which appear in the action .",
    "these cutoffs are logically at the opposite extreme of another class of cutoffs that depend on all the couplings of the action and are called , for reasons that will be made clear in section iii , `` spectrally adjusted '' .    in this note",
    "we would like to do two things .",
    "the first is to calculate the properties of the gravitational fixed point in the einstein - hilbert truncation using a pure cutoff , and compare them to the results of other , more popular cutoffs .",
    "this we shall do in section iv .",
    "the second is to show in general that whenever one uses a pure cutoff , there is a choice of parameters that will yield the same fp as a spectrally adjusted cutoff",
    ". this will be the subject of sect .",
    "v.    for definiteness we shall discuss scheme - dependence in the context of wetterich s exact rg equation @xcite , which uses an additive infrared cutoff . to limit the dimension of the parameter space that we explore we shall keep other aspects of the cutoff and gauge choice fixed .",
    "although stimulated by research on gravity , the points we make in sect .",
    "v are quite general and should apply also to other quantum field theories and to other flow equations .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , most of the progress towards asymptotic safety of the last ten years has come from applying functional renormalization group methods to gravity . in this section",
    "we describe these tools , using first the example of a real scalar field and then describing some of the modifications that are needed in the application to gravity . a general idea put forward by wilson",
    "is that the functional integration should not be performed in one single step covering all field fluctuations from the uv to the ir , weighting all fluctuations with the same bare action , but rather in a sequence of finite steps , updating the action at each step .",
    "a concrete implementation of this idea that is easily amenable to explicit calculations was given in 1993 by wetterich @xcite .",
    "we begin from a formal functional integral @xmath1}=\\int ( d\\phi ) e^{- \\left ( s(\\phi)+\\delta s_k(\\phi)+\\int j\\phi \\right ) } \\ , \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath2 is an external source and @xmath3 the effect of the new term @xmath4 is simply to modify the ( inverse ) propagator of the theory : it replaces @xmath5 by @xmath6 the kernel @xmath7 is chosen so as to suppress the propagation of the modes with momenta @xmath8 and tends to zero for @xmath9 so that high momentum modes are integrated out without any suppression .",
    "we shall discuss the properties of this function in greater detail in section iii .",
    "one then defines a scale  dependent effective action functional @xmath10 , as the legendre transform of @xmath11 , minus the term @xmath4 that we introduced in the beginning : @xmath12=w_k[j]-\\int j\\phi-\\delta s_k(\\phi ) \\ , \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath13 is now to be interpreted as a shorthand for @xmath14 , the variable conjugated to @xmath2 .",
    "if the functional integral is defined by an uv cutoff , then when @xmath15 tends to this cutoff the average effective action is related by a nontrivial transformation to the bare action @xcite . for @xmath16 , @xmath17 and one recovers the standard definition of the effective action ( the generating function of one  particle  irreducible green functions ) .",
    "it is not exactly the wilsonian action but its definition is similar in spirit and it is somewhat easier to work with .",
    "if one evaluates this functional at one loop , it is @xmath18 and its scale dependence is given by @xmath19 here str is a trace that includes a factor @xmath20 for fermionic fields and a factor @xmath21 for complex fields .",
    "it can be shown that the `` renormalization group improvement '' of this equation , which consists in replacing @xmath22 by @xmath23 in the r.h.s . , leads actually to an exact equation often called the functional renormalization group equation ( frge ) @xcite : @xmath24 it is important to observe that the last term in eq.([eq : frge ] ) suppresses the contribution of high momentum modes so that the trace is ultraviolet finite : there is no need to use any ultraviolet regularization .",
    "in fact , once the equation has been derived , it is actually not necessary to refer to the functional integral anymore .",
    "the frge defines a flow in the space of all theories and if we start from any point and we follow the flow in the limit @xmath16 , then we find the effective action , from which in principle we can derive everything we may want to know about the theory .",
    "conversely , by following the flow towards higher energy we can establish whether the theory has a fp with the desired properties .    the application of this equation to gravity has been discussed first in @xcite . since gravity is a gauge theory , one has to take into account the complications due to the gauge fixing and ghost terms .",
    "so far the best way to deal with these complications is to use the background field method .",
    "let @xmath25 be a fixed but otherwise arbitrary metric .",
    "we can write @xmath26 .",
    "it is not implied that @xmath27 is small .",
    "we choose a gauge  fixing condition @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 is some operator , which in the simplest cases is just equal to @xmath25 .",
    "the standard formal manipulations in the path integral give rise to a ghost term @xmath32 and , if @xmath31 contains derivatives , also a `` third ghost '' term @xcite @xmath33 also the cutoff term @xmath4 is written in terms of the background metric @xmath34 where @xmath35 is some differential operator constructed with the background metric . in this way one constructs a generating functional @xmath36 depending on sources that couple linearly to @xmath37 , and on the background metric . applying the definition eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) one obtains a functional @xmath38 where @xmath39 is now a shorthand for @xmath40 , the legendre conjugate of @xmath41 .",
    "one can also think of @xmath23 as a functional of two metrics , namely @xmath42 and the background metric . in the limit @xmath16 this functional becomes the ordinary gravitational effective action in the background gauge .",
    "the functional @xmath43 is invariant under simultaneous coordinate transformations of @xmath44 and @xmath45 , the so  called background gauge transformations .",
    "we will restrict our attention to the functional @xmath46 obtained by the identification of the background field ( which hitherto remained completely unspecified ) and the vacuum expectation value @xmath44 . by construction",
    "this functional has the same gauge invariance as the original action and it contains the information about the familiar terms such as the einstein ",
    "hilbert action .",
    "the functional @xmath43 contains in addition the information about the @xmath15dependence of the gauge  fixing terms and other genuinely bimetric terms in the action @xcite . in the following",
    "we will ignore the rg flow of these terms .",
    "the functional @xmath43 obeys an frge that has the same form as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : frge ] ) , where @xmath13 now stands for @xmath37 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "there is a large arbitrarines in the choice of the cutoff @xmath4 .",
    "let us begin by discussing the simplest example : a scalar theory in flat space with the action truncated to : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is an even potential .",
    "the cutoff is usually written in momentum space as in eq .",
    "( [ cutoff ] ) where @xmath52 is a function that is only required to satisfy the boundary conditions that are appropriate to a cutoff , namely :    * it tends rapidly to zero when @xmath53 . *",
    "it tends to @xmath54 when @xmath5 tends to zero .",
    "* it is monotonically decreasing in @xmath5 .",
    "* it is monotonically decreasing in @xmath15 , uniformly in @xmath5 .",
    "the second condition is a kind of normalization and is not strictly necessary : it is possible to allow @xmath52 to tend to some other finite value , or even to infinity , when @xmath16 . however , for reasons that will become clear shortly , it is convenient to keep fixed the value of @xmath55 . aside from this , the shape of the function is arbitrary . inserting the ansatz for @xmath23 ,",
    "the frge becomes @xmath56 where @xmath57 , @xmath58 and the modified inverse propagator @xmath59 is defined as in eq .",
    "( [ cutoff ] ) .    from here ,",
    "taking derivatives with respect to @xmath60 , one can extract the beta functions of the coefficients of the taylor expansion of the potential .",
    "these beta functions will depend in general on the choice of @xmath52 .",
    "one notable exception , in four dimensions , is the beta function of the quartic coupling , which in the limit where the mass and the higher couplings are negligible , turns out to be independent of @xmath52 .",
    "the way in which this happens is as follows : the trace in the r.h.s . of the frge",
    "involves an integration over @xmath5 . in the specific case ,",
    "the function to be integrated turns out to be a total derivative and therefore depends only on the boundary values .",
    "since these have been fixed , it is completely determined .",
    "see appendix a in @xcite for details .",
    "the discussion can be refined by taking into account a wave function renormalization constant @xmath61 in front of the kinetic term .",
    "one then usually modifies the definition eq .",
    "( [ cutoff ] ) by including a factor @xmath61 : @xmath62 the reason why this is convenient is that the inverse propagator @xmath63 and the cutoff @xmath64 then neatly combine into a modified inverse propagator @xmath65 and the overall factors of @xmath61 cancel between numerator and denominator of the frge , which takes the form @xmath66 where we have defined @xmath67 .",
    "the choice of the shape of the function @xmath52 is an aspect of the cutoff scheme which involves infinitely many parameters .",
    "when one considers more complicated theories , further `` discrete '' choices present themselves .",
    "for example , in the case of gravity truncated to the hilbert action , the second variation of the action has the following schematic form : @xmath68,\\ ] ] where @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath49 and @xmath71 are constants and @xmath72 and the curvature term @xmath73 are computed with the background metric .",
    "tensor structures are omitted , since they are not essential for the argument . since in curved spacetime",
    "one can not use momentum space methods , in the definition of the cutoff one has to decompose the fields on a basis of eigenvectors of some selfadjoint differential operator .",
    "the cutoff then suppresses the modes with eigenvalues @xmath74 ( if the operator is of second order ) .",
    "one then has a choice of what operator to use . in @xcite",
    "we called a cutoff of type i , ii or iii , respectively , if it is defined using the spectrum of @xmath75 , @xmath76 or @xmath77 .    in the literature , an overall factor of @xmath69",
    "is inserted in the definition of the cutoff as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : scalar_cutoffz ] ) . in the case of gravity",
    "there are some differences .",
    "unlike in the scalar case , the coefficient @xmath61 is dimensionful ; even more important , one can show that @xmath61 is now an essential coupling constant in the sense that it can not be eliminated by rescaling the metric without changing the unit of mass @xmath15 @xcite . in spite of these differences , it is still true that @xmath61 does not appear in the reference operator , so in the case of type i and ii cutoffs the spectrum of the operator does not depend on @xmath15 . in the type iii cutoff",
    "the reference operator contains the running coupling @xmath78 . as a consequence , also",
    "the spectrum of the reference operator changes with @xmath15 .",
    "for this reason this is called a `` spectrally adjusted cutoff '' .",
    "it has been argued in @xcite that such cutoffs give improved results .    in this paper",
    "we would like to explore in the opposite direction and consider a class of cutoff functions that do not depend on _ any _ coupling , not even on @xmath61 .",
    "quite generally , we will refer to a cutoff that does not contain any parameter that appears in the action as a `` pure '' cutoff .",
    "we will now discuss the example of gravity in the einstein - hilbert truncation , where one retains only the terms with up to two derivatives of the metric : @xmath79 where @xmath69 , @xmath80 is a gauge  fixing term and @xmath81 is the ghost action .",
    "we decompose the metric into @xmath82 where @xmath83 is a background .",
    "we consider a de donder background gauge : @xmath84 where @xmath85 all covariant derivatives are with respect to the background metric . in the following all metrics will be background metrics , and we will omit the superscript @xmath86 for notational simplicity . in order to restrict the number of parameters ,",
    "we will fix @xmath87 which leads to considerable simplifications .    after calculating the second variation of the action",
    ", we decompose @xmath37 into its different spin components according to @xmath88 and @xmath89 where @xmath90 is tranverse and traceless , @xmath91 is a transverse vector , @xmath92 and @xmath27 are scalars , @xmath93 and @xmath94 are transverse vectors , and @xmath95 and @xmath96 are scalars .",
    "these fields are subject to the following differential constraints : @xmath97 we further redefine @xmath98 which removes some powers of @xmath75 from the second variation and furthermore cancels some jacobian determinants that arise in the functional integral when one performs the decomposition eq .",
    "( [ decomposition ] ) .",
    "we then drop the hat from @xmath91 and @xmath92    in order to extract the beta functions of @xmath78 and @xmath61 it is enough to calculate the r.h.s . of the frge on the background of a sphere .",

    "we require that after adding the cutoff , the modified inverse propagator has the same form as in except for the replacement of @xmath75 by @xmath100 , where @xmath59 is defined as in eq .",

    "this means that when the inverse propagator has the form eq .",

    "the frge takes the form @xmath102 where @xmath67 .",
    "the first term comes from the spin2 , transverse traceless components , the second from the spin1 transverse vector , the third and fourth from the scalars @xmath27 and @xmath92 .",

    "one finds the following beta functions for the dimensionless couplings @xmath104 , @xmath105 : @xmath106 which admit a fp at @xmath107 , @xmath108 , with critical exponents @xmath109 .    [ t ]",
    "as anticipated , we would like to examine a different type of cutoff , not depending on any of the parameters that are present in the action .",
    "the cutoff eq .",
    "( [ cutoffib ] ) depends on the parameter @xmath61 , so to define a pure cutoff we replace @xmath61 by @xmath110 where @xmath111 is an arbitrary number : @xmath112",

    "the fp now depends on the arbitrary parameter @xmath111 , which is part of the freedom in the definition of the cutoff .",
    "this reflects itself in the position of the fixed point , as shown in figure 1 .",
    "we give separately the dependence of @xmath118 , @xmath119 and of the dimensionless product @xmath120 .",
    "we see that as @xmath111 varies over four orders of magnitude , @xmath118 , @xmath119 each vary by less than one order of magnitude , and @xmath120 changes just by a factor smaller than 2 . it had been observed before that the dimensionless product @xmath0 has a beta function that is gauge independent in lowest order in an expansion in @xmath121 @xcite ;",
    "also its value at the fp was found to be quite insensitive to the choice of gauge and cutoff .",
    "our findings confirm this picture also for the dependence on the parameter @xmath111 . in figure 2",
    "we also give the critical exponents as functions of @xmath111 . as with other cutoffs ,",
    "they form a complex conjugate pair , but for large @xmath111 the imaginary part of the eigenvalue goes to zero and for @xmath122 we find two real eigenvalues . clearly for very large or very small @xmath111 the properties of the fp are significantly affected , but there is a wide range of values for which the properties of the fp are quite stable .",
    "we observe that the curves in figure 1 pass through the position of the fixed point in the type ib cutoff examined previously , which is marked by a dot in the graphs .",
    "in other words , there is a value of @xmath111 for which the pure cutoff gives a fp in the same position as the type ib cutoff .",
    "the corresponding value is precisely @xmath123 .",
    "it would seem from ( 28 ) that the beta functions become singular when @xmath124 but if we put @xmath125 and expand in powers of @xmath126 , the coefficient of the negative powers of @xmath126 cancel out .",

    "of ( 25 ) .",
    "there is clearly something special happening when @xmath111 has the value of @xmath127 in the type ib cutoff . in the next section",
    "we will explain the origin of this coincidence and we will see that it holds in much greater generality .",
    "we have shown in the previous section , in the special case of gravity in the einstein hilbert truncation , that there is a value of the parameter @xmath111 for which a pure cutoff reproduces the results of a type i cutoff . in this section",
    "we argue that this property is quite general .",
    "since we are going to move to a much more general setting we will have to make some choices in order to somehow circumscribe the scope of the argument .",
    "we assume that @xmath23 admits a derivative expansion of the form @xmath128 where @xmath129 are operators and @xmath130 are numerical parameters depending on @xmath15 .",

    "( [ rhs2 ] ) we see that the only difference lies in the replacement of @xmath141 by @xmath173 in certain functional dependences .",
    "it is clear that since the fp equation for the spectrally adjusted cutoff has a zero when we replace everywhere @xmath141 by the numbers @xmath164 , then the fp equation for the pure cutoff will also have a zero when we replace all the @xmath173 and all the @xmath141 by @xmath164 . therefore with the particular choice of parameters @xmath175 , the pure cutoff produces a fp in the same position as the spectrally adjusted type iii cutoff .",
    "this result has been derived using what we call a `` type iii '' cutoff , because the argument is easier to make independently of the form of the action , but we believe that it holds more generally , also for other cutoffs . to illustrate this consider a generalization of what was called a `` type i '' cutoff in @xcite . in a gauge theory the second variation defined in eq .",
    "( [ delta ] ) is a differential operator constructed with the covariant derivative @xmath152 .",
    "let us assume that the truncation of the theory is such that @xmath151 depends on @xmath152 only through the combination @xmath176 . to make this explicit",
    "let us write it as @xmath177 .",
    "a generalized type i cutoff can be defined by the requirement that the modified inverse propagator has the same form as the original one except for the replacement of @xmath75 by @xmath100 : @xmath178 the beta functional that one obtains with this cutoff has the form @xmath179 which upon use of the trick explained above yields equivalent fp equations as @xmath180 again we can define a pure cutoff of generalized type i by replacing @xmath130 by @xmath181 in @xmath182 @xmath183 the beta functional that one obtains with this cutoff has the form @xmath184    again we see that the two beta functionals have the same form except for the replacement of @xmath141 by @xmath173 in certain functional dependences ; additional terms in the first factor cancel for @xmath185 .",
    "therefore the argument given above shows that if we set @xmath175 the pure cutoff will have a fp in the same position as the generalized type i cutoff .",
    "the reason why this discussion is less general than the previous one is that this type of cutoff could only be defined if the inverse propagator has a specific form . it may be possible to generalize this argument , for example defining the cutoff by the rule @xmath186 we will not pursue this further . the discussion of the type iii cutoff is sufficient to make the point in generality .",
    "furthermore , the type iii cutoff is `` ideologically '' at the opposite extreme of a pure cutoff , being always fully dependent on all couplings .",
    "this is also supported by the numerical results , which show that type iii cutoffs yield fixed points at at the extreme end of the range of variation @xcite .",
    "so it is somewhat reassuring that one can reproduce at least the fp position of a spectrally adjusted , type iii cutoff by a pure cutoff .",
