    "the origin of the moon is one of the most important problems in the planetary science . the giant impact ( gi ) hypothesis @xcite is currently the most popular , since it can solve difficulties that other models face , such as the current angular momentum of earth - moon system and moon s small core fraction compared to the other rocky planets . according to the gi hypothesis , at the late stage of the terrestrial planet formation , a mars - sized protoplanet collided with the proto - earth and produced a circumplanetary debris disk , from which the earth s moon is formed . to examine whether this scenario really works or",
    "not , a number of numerical simulations of collisions between two planetary embryos have been carried out ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "most of them were done by using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) method which was a widely used particle - based fluid simulation method developed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "recently , however , it is pointed out that the results of numerical simulation of gi by sph method should be re - examined from the geochemical point of view .",
    "recent high precision measurement of isotope ratio revealed that it is not easy for the gi hypothesis to reproduce observed properties of the moon .",
    "the moon and the earth have almost identical isotopic composition for oxygen @xcite , and isotopic ratios chromium @xcite , titanium @xcite , tungsten @xcite and silicon @xcite .",
    "this means that the bulk of the moon should come from the proto - earth , unless very efficient mixing occurred for all the isotopic elements @xcite . on the other hand , in previous numerical simulations of gi ,",
    "the disk material comes primarily from the impactor , which is likely to have had the different isotopic compositions from that of the earth . to solve this problem ,",
    "several models have been proposed and studied numerically .",
    "these models have the total angular momentum significantly larger than that of the present earth - moon system .",
    "models with a fast rotating proto - earth @xcite , a hit - and - run collision @xcite and a massive impactor @xcite have been proposed .",
    "although the excess angular momentum is assumed to be removed by the evection resonance with the sun ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it may work only a narrow range of tidal parameters @xcite .",
    "this means that the moon was formed by a fortuitous event .",
    "recently , however , it is pointed out that the results of numerical simulations with the standard formulation of sph ( ssph ) is problematic .",
    "it turned out that ssph has problems in dealing with a contact discontinuity and a free surface .",
    "it is pointed out that these difficulties result in serious problems , such as the treatment of hydrodynamical instabilities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this problem arises from the assumption in ssph that the local density distribution is differentiable , though in real fluid , the density is not differentiable around the contact discontinuity . as a result , around the contact discontinuity , the density of the low - density side is overestimated and that of the high - density side is underestimated .",
    "thus , pressure is also misestimated around the contact discontinuity and an `` unphysical '' repulsive force appears .",
    "this unphysical repulsive force causes a strong surface tension which suppresses the growth of hydrodynamical instabilities . in the gi simulation , since the core - mantle boundary is a contact discontinuity and the planetary surface also has a density jump , the accurate treatment of the contact discontinuities is very important .",
    "we have developed a novel sph formulation , density independent sph ( disph ) , to solve the problem for the contact discontinuity @xcite .",
    "instead of the differentiability of the density , disph requires the differentiability of the pressure . as a result ,",
    "disph significantly improves the treatment of the contact discontinuity .",
    "thereby , gi must also be re - investigated by disph . in this paper , we present results of gi simulations performed with disph and compare them with those obtained with ssph by focusing on the treatment of contact discontinuity and its impacts on the results .",
    "we found that disph produced significantly different debris disk , which should lead to different moon forming process .",
    "we concluded that the results of gi is sensitive to the numerical scheme and previous numerical simulations of gi should be re - considered .",
    "it is worth noting that @xcite reported the results of gi by a three - dimensional grid - base method .",
    "they found that the post impact evolution of the disk is different from that of ssph .",
    "they pointed out that it is due to the poor description of debris disk .",
    "they suggested that the difference may be due to low - resolution for the debris disk in sph calculations .",
    "however , it could be rather due to their oversimplified polytropic - like eos .",
    "thus , it is not straightforward to compare their results with ssph .",
    "@xcite reported the comparison of the results of gi between adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) and sph and concluded that the predicted moon mass of two methods are quantitatively quite similar .",
    "although we notice qualitative differences in disk spatial structures in some of these results ( for example , the different clump structure between amr and sph in fig . 4 of @xcite ) , our disph also predicts similar moon masses for the collision parameters that they tested , as we will mention in section 5 .",
    "comprehensive code - code comparison is needed with grid codes , as well as between disph and ssph . in this paper",
    ", we focus on the latter comparison .    here",
    "we do not insist that the results of gi simulations by disph are much closer to realistic phenomenon than by ssph .",
    "while disph has been improved for treatment of a contact boundary , both disph and ssph have a problem to treat free surface , i.e. , planetary surface .",
    "we here stress that only the improvement for treatment of a contact boundary significantly affects properties of circumplanetary disks generated by gi .",
    "therefore , we need to be very careful when some definitive conclusions are drawn from the current numerical simulations for gi . to clarify details of moon formation",
    ", it is necessary to develop the numerical hydrodynamical scheme for gi that properly treats the planetary surface as well as the core - mantle boundary .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we briefly describe the numerical technique .",
    "we focus on the implementation of disph for non - ideal eos . in section 3 , we describe models of the gi simulations . in section 4 , we show the results and comparisons of the gi simulations with the two methods and clarify the reason for the difference in the properties of the generated disks .",
    "we also show the results of single component objects , in addition to those of differentiated objects with core - mantle structure .",
    "the former and latter simulations discriminate the differences due to a free surface from a core - mantle boundary between the two methods . in section 5 ,",
    "we summarize this paper .",
    "in the sph method , the evolution of fluid is expressed by the motions of fluid elements that are called sph particles .",
    "the governing equations are written in the lagrangian form of hydrodynamic conservation laws .",
    "the equations of motion and energy of the @xmath0-th particles are written as follows : @xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the position vector , the acceleration vector , the specific internal energy and the time , respectively .",
    "the subscript @xmath0 denotes the value of @xmath0-th particle .",
    "the superscripts @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 mean the contributions of the hydrodynamical force evaluated by sph , viscosity and self - gravity , respectively .",
    "the formal difference between ssph and disph is in the form of @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the other terms in the right hand side of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : motion ] ) and ( [ eq : energy ] ) have the same forms for both methods . since the equations of ssph can be found in the previous literature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , here we will only describe those of disph .",
    "disph is originally developed by @xcite for the ideal gas eos and then extended to an arbitrary eos by @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of disph is the elimination of unphysical surface tension which rises at the contact discontinuity .",
    "the unphysical surface tension in ssph comes from the requirement of the differentiability of the density .",
    "@xcite developed a new sph formulation which does not require the differentiability of the density , but requires that of ( a function of ) pressure .",
    "as a result , their new sph can correctly handle hydrodynamical instability .",
    "note that around the shock , neither the pressure nor the density is continuous .",
    "thus the assumption of the differentiability of pressure and density is broken across the shock .",
    "@xcite used the quantity @xmath11 where @xmath12 is as pressure and @xmath13 is a constant exponent for their formulation to improve the treatment of the shock instead of the symbol @xmath13 . ] .",
    "@xcite applied @xmath14 and show that the treatment the strong shock is improved .",
    "however , they considered only ideal gas eos . here , we apply this formulation to fluids with non - ideal eos .",
    "the choice of @xmath13 is related with how to treat a free surface such as a planetary surface .",
    "disph overestimates the pressure gradient around the free surface , while ssph underestimates it .    in appendix",
    "[ sec : app1 ] , we show the results of the 3d shock problem simulated with ssph and disph . in the ideal gas",
    "eos case ( fig .",
    "[ fig : st3d ] ) , the numerical pressure blip at the contact boundary is the smallest for @xmath14 , while the numerical density blip is relatively large for the same @xmath14 .",
    "@xcite determined @xmath14 as a best choice for ideal gas through more detailed discussions . on the other hand , in the tillotson eos case",
    ", it is not clear that which @xmath13 is the best choice . in the case of 3d shock problem ( fig .",
    "[ fig : st3d ] ) , @xmath15 is the best choice .",
    "however , in the case of strong shock test , @xmath14 may be the best choice .",
    "tillotson eos ( fig .",
    "[ fig : st3dt ] ) shows the different dependence of the numerical pressure blip at the contact boundary on @xmath13 from that with ideal eos .",
    "this indicates that the smaller @xmath13 works better to treat large pressure jump , namely , the strong shock and the free surface .",
    "we adopt @xmath16 also in this paper , although more comprehensive tests on the choice of @xmath13 are needed in future study .",
    "we will show the effects of improved treatment of the free surface and the core - mantle boundary in section 4.1 and 4.2 , respectively .    in appendix",
    "[ sec : app2 ] , we also show the results of the keplerien disk test and gresho vortex problem .",
    "results of the keplerien disk tests with ssph and disph tell us that both schemes can maintain the disk structure during the first several orbital period , whereas catastrophic breakup takes place before @xmath17 orbital period .",
    "previous studies also reported the same results @xcite . in our simulations of gi , we only follow about @xmath18 times of the rotation period ( @xmath19 hrs at @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the current earth s radius ) . we thus consider that the effect of the numerical am transfer is not crucial for our simulation results . from the gresho vortex test",
    ", we can see that there is no critical difference between results with two schemes .",
    "overall , both ssph and disph are capable of dealing with rotation disks with similar degree , as far as the simulation time is less than @xmath18 orbital periods .    the essential difference between disph and ssph is in the way to estimate the volume element of a particle , @xmath22 . as the starting point , following @xcite and @xcite , we introduce the physical quantity : @xmath23 where brackets",
    "mean `` smoothed '' values .",

    "following @xcite , we chose @xmath41 and @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the density . note that since the interactions between two particles are antisymmetric , our sph conserves the total momentum and energy .",
    "the grad-@xmath34 term improves the treatment of the strong shock ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . in appendix",
    "[ sec : app4 ] , we show the results of strong shock with disph both with and without the grad-@xmath34 term . we show that our disph with the grad-@xmath34 term works well for the strong shock .",
    "our disph with the grad-@xmath34 term has enough capability for the problems which include strong shock .",

    ", we employ the cubic spline function @xcite .",
    "note that the use of the cubic spline kernel for the derivative sometimes causes the paring instability @xcite . in order to avoid this instability ,",
    "we adopt a gradient of the kernel which has a triangular shape @xcite .    for the artificial viscosity , with both methods , we use the artificial viscosity described in @xcite . note that for both methods we use the smoothed density for the evaluation of artificial viscosity .",

    "on the other hand , in the case of collisions between differentiated objects with core - mantle boundary , disph predicts more massive moon masses than ssph does for high - oblique impacts , while it still predicts lower mass moons for low - oblique impacts ( section [ sec : time evolve ] ) . the different dependence on the initial impact angular momentum from the single component objects would come from the transfer of impact momentum to the mantle layer with low density and numerical repulsive force at the core - mantle boundary ( section [ sec : time evolve ] and [ sec : predicted moon mass ] ) .",

    "note that in this test , we omit the material strength .    in the third test , we followed the early time evolution of the glass - on - water test , following @xcite .",
    "we first place target particles in @xmath180 .",
    "then , we placed projectile particles with the impact velocity @xmath181 km / sec .",
    "we employed @xmath182 particles in total .",
    "we set the impact angle to @xmath178 ( vertical impact ) the radius of projectile is set to @xmath183 mm .",

    "figure [ fig : fs ] shows the results of @xcite s test . with ssph , at @xmath105 sound crossing time , particles around the free surface clearly move to the different positions from the initial positions and at @xmath184 sound crossing time , particles move downward . with disph ,",

    "figures [ fig : al_to_al ] and [ fig : raddep ] show the snapshots of the aluminium - to - aluminium test with both methods .",
    "both methods produce roughly similar results ; the jetting and excavation of the target is produced around the impact site .",
    "the crater size and depth are almost indistinguishable between ssph and disph .",
    "disph has similar accuracy / errors for free surface as ssph does .",
    "note that there are several differences between two results , e.g. , the height and expansion of impact jetting .",
    "figure [ fig : glass_on_water ] shows the results of the glass - on - water test with both methods . unlike the aluminium - to - aluminium test , this test contains the contact discontinuity between water and wet tuff .",
    "similar to the aluminium - to - aluminium test , the height and expansion of the ejecta curtain is different between two methods , which could be due to the unphysical surface tension between two different materials arising in ssph calculations .",
    "the target particles are pushed up by the projectile particles at the early step of the impact ( @xmath185s - @xmath186s ) .",
    "this results in the higher crater rim with ssph than disph . at @xmath187s ,",
    "ssph produces oblate projectile , while with disph , the projectile and target are mixed .",
    "this clearly due to the unphysical surface tension term which results in an underestimate of material mixing .",
    "this difference may be related to the difference in impact - generated disks in the gi simulations between disph and ssph .",
    "figure [ fig : eject_mass ] shows the cumulative mass of ejecta @xmath188 with a vertical velocity greater than a given velocity @xmath189 .",
    "according to the previous works ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the results should have a power - law form with a slope of @xmath190 : @xmath191 where @xmath192 and @xmath193 are the velocity of the impactor , the density of the impactor and the density of the target . here ,",
    "@xmath194 and @xmath195 are material parameters which are set to be @xmath196 and @xmath197 @xcite .",
    "both methods reproduced roughly similar results to the experiments shown in @xcite .",
    "the power - law regime with a slope of @xmath198 is well reproduced with both methods .",
    "however , ssph produces high speed jetting component ( @xmath199 ) , which can hardly be seen in the experimental results .",
    "this difference should come from the fact that the target particles feel unphysical surface tension from the penetrating projectile , as stated in the previous paragraph .",
    "the target particles are pushed up by the projectile particles to acquire high vertical velocity .",
    "this could result in the difference of the results of gi between two methods .",
    "it is not clear which sph scheme is more correct , especially for the free surface .",
    "the tests carried out in this appendix are performed using a 2d cartesian geometry .",
    "the results may differ from 2d cylindrical or 3d geometries .",
    "thus , it is not straightforward to compare these results with @xcite and the experiments . to carry out appropriate comparison , we need to perform 3d impact tests or use 2d axisymmetric domain",
    "however , note that disph does not show unphysical behavior compared to the results with grid code .",

    "<S> at present , the giant impact ( gi ) is the most widely accepted model for the origin of the moon . </S>",
    "<S> most of the numerical simulations of gi have been carried out with the smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) method . </S>",
    "<S> recently , however , it has been pointed out that standard formulation of sph ( ssph ) has difficulties in the treatment of a contact discontinuity such as a core - mantle boundary and a free surface such as a planetary surface . </S>",
    "<S> this difficulty comes from the assumption of differentiability of density in ssph . </S>",
    "<S> we have developed an alternative formulation of sph , density independent sph ( disph ) , which is based on differentiability of pressure instead of density to solve the problem of a contact discontinuity . in this paper </S>",

    "<S> we found that the disk properties , such as mass and angular momentum produced by disph is different from that of ssph . </S>",
    "<S> in general , the disks formed by disph are more compact : while formation of a smaller mass moon for low - oblique impacts is expected with disph , inhibition of ejection would promote formation of a larger mass moon for high - oblique impacts . since only the improvement of core - mantle boundary significantly affects the properties of circumplanetary disks generated by gi and disph has not been significantly improved from ssph for a free surface , we should be very careful when some conclusions are drawn from the numerical simulations for gi . and </S>",
