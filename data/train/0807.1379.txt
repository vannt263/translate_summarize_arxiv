    "it is widely recognized that numerical methods based on the first principle are quite important in the study of quantum spin systems .",
    "actually the quantum monte carlo method has contributed toward enlarging our knowledge of non - frustrated quantum spin systems , especially of the spin-1/2 quantum heisenberg antiferromagnet on bipartite lattices@xcite .",
    "yet it is well known that this monte carlo method has a limited power in calculations of two - dimensional frustrated spin systems . in this situation",
    "many studies on numerical methods have been proposed and developed , sometimes depending on approximations .",
    "one of these studies is the coupled - cluster method@xcite , which is a kind of variational method .",
    "another approach is the stochastic reconfiguration method@xcite whose origin is assigned to the fixed - node monte carlo method@xcite .",
    "one should also attend to various studies on the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method@xcite which extend the original dmrg method on a chain@xcite to higher dimensional systems .",
    "the path - integral renormalization group method@xcite is interesting as well .",
    "recently we have developed another monte carlo method , which we call the stochastic state selection ( sss ) method@xcite .",
    "this method has a good property common to the ordinary monte carlo method that in principle one does not need any approximations specific to the system we investigate .",
    "the sampling algorithm is , however , quite different from the ordinary one since the sss method is based on not importance sampling but a new type of stochastic selection . in the sss method",
    "we use an operator which generates sampled states from any given state .",
    "this operator includes a set of stochastic variables which are as many as the number of basis states of the vector space under consideration .",
    "the essential point of the selection is that many of these stochastic variables are valued to be zero while their statistical averages are all equal to one .",
    "therefore in this algorithm we select a relatively small number of basis states from a vast vector space in a mathematically justified manner so that the statistical averaging processes give us the correct value of any inner product .",
    "so far all these stochastic variables have been generated independently .    in this paper",
    "we propose the _ constrained sss method _  a modified sss method whose samples satisfy a number of given constraints . in order to make it possible",
    "we introduce some dependencies among the stochastic variables stated above . from theoretical point of view",
    "all we need to restore the original state from sampled states is that the statistical average of each stochastic variable is equal to one .",
    "therefore we can define some variables in the set as functions of other variables , instead of requesting they should be independently generated , if each of these functions assures that the statistical average of the dependent variable equals to one . keeping this in mind",
    "we develop the constrained sss method , where values of special inner products to represent constraints are unchanged in each sampling .",
    "we then argue that sampling errors in numerical studies can be reduced with suitable constraints and with suitable dependent variables .    as a concrete example",
    ", we calculate energy eigenvalues around the ground state of the spin-1/2 quantum heisenberg antiferromagnet on an @xmath0-site triangular lattice .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes the spin-1/2 operator on the @xmath3-th site and the sum runs over all @xmath4 bonds of the lattice .",
    "the coupling @xmath5 is set to 1 throughout this paper . in our calculations",
    "we employ the power method .",
    "the constrained sss method is used to calculate the expectation values of powers of the operator @xmath6 , @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the identity operator and @xmath9 is a positive number which depends on the lattice size . for each lattice size",
    "we choose one value of @xmath9 which ensures that the ground state eigenvalue of the system corresponds to the eigenvalue of @xmath10 whose absolute value is the largest .",
    "detailed explanations for it are given in appendix a.    one reason why we study this system here is that , as is well - known , it is a typical example of strongly frustrated systems in two dimensions .",
    "another reason is that there has been a long history of investigations into what state is realized on the triangular lattice .",
    "lots of studies on this system@xcite indicate the ground state with the three - sublattice order@xcite .",
    "one should , however , also note recent works@xcite which suggest that this quantum system has a richer phase structure than the one expected from the classical spin wave theory , as well as other studies@xcite which show that this system is near the quantum critical point .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe the method .",
    "subsection [ subsec21 ] is devoted to a brief review of the conventional sss method@xcite . in subsections [ subsec22 ] and [ subsec23 ]",
    "we make a detailed account of the constrained sss method .",
    "first we give a simple example to explain how we impose a constraint in a sampling in subsection [ subsec22 ] .",
    "then extensions to more general cases are discussed in subsection [ subsec23 ] .",
    "sections [ secexact ] , [ secappx ] and [ sec48site ] are for applications of the method to the spin 1/2 quantum heisenberg antiferromagnet on triangular lattices . in section [ secexact ]",
    "we study the model on a @xmath11-site lattice , where the exact eigenstate can be easily obtained . using this exact eigenstate",
    "we evaluate expectation values of the @xmath12-th power of the operator @xmath10 by means of the constrained sss method .",
    "we find that our results from one sampling coincide with the exact expectation values . in section [ secappx ]",
    "we investigate the model on the @xmath13-site lattice , for which a number of low - lying energy eigenvalues are known from the exact diagonalizations@xcite . starting with approximate states for the ground state of the system , which we obtain through procedures described in appendix b , we argue the accuracy of the constrained sss method by comparing our results with the ground state energy reported in ref.@xcite .",
    "the resultant expectation values show that the constraints are effective to improve sampling errors .",
    "section [ sec48site ] is to report our numerical results on the @xmath14-site lattice where we know neither the exact eigenstate nor the exact eigenvalue . assuming some symmetries which exist in the model on the @xmath13-site lattice , we evaluate expectation values of the @xmath12-th power of the operator @xmath10 obtained from several approximate states whose @xmath15 , the @xmath16 component of the total spin @xmath17 of the system , is less than or equal to @xmath18 .",
    "we then estimate lowest energies for each sectors with @xmath19 @xmath20 .",
    "we see our data are well described by the arguments based on the spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "the final section is for summary and discussions . at the end of the paper",
    "we add three appendices in order to give detailed description for some parts of our numerical study .",
    "appendix a is to explain how we determine values of @xmath9 in ( [ qdef ] ) . in appendix",
    "b we show our procedure to obtain approximate states on the 36-site and 48-site lattices .",

    "in this section we describe our method .",
    "subsection [ subsec21 ] is to give a brief description of the conventional sss method , the sss method which is not accompanied with any constraints@xcite .",
    "then subsection [ subsec22 ] follows to show our basic idea for constraints .",
    "finally in subsection [ subsec23 ] we describe the constrained sss method in detail .",
    "the stochastic state selection is realized by a number of stochastic variables .",
    "let us expand a normalized state @xmath21 in an @xmath22-dimensional vector space by a basis @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",

    "a _ random choice operator _",
    "@xmath36 is then defined by @xmath37 using this @xmath36 we obtain a state @xmath38 , @xmath39 which has less non - zero elements than @xmath21 has .",
    "we call the difference between @xmath38 and @xmath40 , @xmath41 a _ random state_.    since @xmath42 an expectation value @xmath43 with an operator @xmath44 is exactly equal to the statistical average @xmath45",
    ".    note that in the conventional sss method _ all _ @xmath25 s are independently generated stochastic variables .      in this subsection",
    "we show our basic ideas in a very simple toy model .",
    "this model has only two basis states in the vector space , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , which are orthonormalized as @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "if we apply the conventional sss method to a state @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath52 in this vector space we obtain a state @xmath38 , @xmath53 where both @xmath54 and @xmath55 are stochastic variables generated by ( [ probf ] ) .",
    "we can reproduce the state @xmath40 by the averaging process since @xmath56 now we notify that independency between @xmath54 and @xmath55 are not needed in ( [ psip ] ) because @xmath57 is fulfilled as far as @xmath58 .",
    "by making use of this possible dependency we can impose a constraint .",
    "for example , let @xmath55 be _ not _ an independent stochastic variable _ but _ the following function of @xmath54 , @xmath59 it is clear that ( [ psip ] ) holds with ( [ eta2 ] ) because @xmath60 follows from @xmath61 . with ( [ eta2 ] ) we also see that @xmath62 holds in each sampling . in other words , we have a constraint that a normalization @xmath63 is a constant @xmath64 .",
    "this also means that @xmath65 for any sampling , where @xmath66 is the random state defined by ( [ randomstate ] ) .",
    "it is possible to impose a more general constraint @xmath67 instead of ( [ conoth ] ) , with a given state @xmath68 .",
    "to do so we should let @xmath69 then we obtain @xmath70 which is equivalent to ( [ conexg ] ) .",
    "in this subsection we present a way to impose constraints in the sss method .",
    "it is straightforward to generalize discussions in subsection [ subsec22 ] for a larger vector space constructed by @xmath22 basis states .",
    "let the constraint be , with a given state @xmath71 , @xmath72 for a state @xmath73 and @xmath74 . in this case we should solve the equation @xmath75 to give one of @xmath25 , say @xmath76 , as a function of @xmath77 independent stochastic variables with @xmath78 .",
    "@xmath79 from the fact that @xmath80 for all @xmath81 except for @xmath82 , it is clear that ( [ etajsol ] ) guarantees @xmath83 . as for @xmath84",
    ", we find @xmath85 in principle , @xmath82 can be any of @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath22 . from practical point of view",
    ", however , @xmath82 should be chosen carefully so that sampling errors are diminished .",
    "when we choose the state @xmath40 as the state @xmath89 , which means @xmath90 for all @xmath81 , the right - hand side of ( [ etaj2 g ] ) becomes @xmath91 . in this case",
    "it is clear that we can lessen this quantity by picking up @xmath82 which realizes @xmath92 for any @xmath81 .",
    "numerical examinations for this choice will be given in following sections .",
    "another generalization to impose more than one constraint is also easy .",
    "let @xmath93 denote the number of constraints .",
    "as far as @xmath94 we can impose constraints for given states @xmath95 @xmath96 by requesting @xmath93 variables among @xmath25 s depend on @xmath97 other @xmath25 s which are independent stochastic variables generated by ( [ probf ] ) .",
    "more concrete description of the way to impose constraints is as follows . if we know the coefficients of the expansions of these states , the above constraints ( [ consk ] ) read @xmath98 with @xmath99 from ( [ conskeq ] ) we obtain @xmath100 which are dependent on other stochastic variables . since these dependencies are linear , the conditions @xmath101 are always satisfied .",
    "a choice of @xmath102 is arbitrary , but the sample fluctuations will depend on the choice .",

    "we can easily obtain the exact ground state and its eigenvalue by the exact diagonalization .",
    "this enables us to compare our results from the constrained sss method with the exact ones .",

    "from the exact eigenvalue we obtain @xmath109 in order to calculate these expectation values by the constrained sss method , we insert random choice operators @xmath110 and calculate @xmath111 here we denote random choice operators by @xmath112 instead of @xmath113 since we want to emphasize that different operators , each of which includes stochastic variables independent of those in other operators , are used .",
