    "our thesis in this paper is that mathematics ( including logic ) can be used to attack the problem of finding a realistic interpretation of ( standard dirac - von - neumann ) quantum mechanics ( qm ) .",
    "mathematics itself contains a very basic duality that can be associated with two meta - physical types of reality :    1 .   the common - sense notion of objectively definite reality assumed in classical physics , and 2 .   the notion of objectively indefinite reality suggested by quantum physics .",
    "the problem of interpreting quantum mechanics _ is _ essentially the problem of making sense out of the notion of objective indefiniteness .",
    "the approach taken here is to follow the lead of the mathematics of partitions , first for sets ( where things are relatively `` clear and distinct '' ) and then for complex vector spaces where the mathematics of full qm resides .",
    "there has long been the notion of subjective or epistemic indefiniteness ( `` cloud of ignorance '' ) that is slowly cleared up with more discrimination and distinctions ( as in the game of twenty questions ) .",
    "but the vision of reality that seems appropriate for quantum mechanics is _ objective or ontological indefiniteness_. the notion of objective indefiniteness in qm has been most emphasized by abner shimony ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    _",

    "complete _ description means that the indefiniteness of a superposition state is in some sense objective or ontological and not just subjective or epistemic .",
    "in addition to shimony s `` objective indefiniteness '' ( the phrase also used by gregg jaeger @xcite and used here ) , other philosophers of physics have suggested related ideas such as :    * peter mittelstaedt s `` incompletely determined '' quantum states with `` objective indeterminateness '' @xcite , * paul busch and gregg jaeger s `` unsharp quantum reality '' @xcite , * paul feyerabend s `` inherent indefiniteness '' @xcite , * allen stairs `` value indefiniteness '' and `` disjunctive facts '' @xcite , * e. j. lowe s `` vague identity '' and `` indeterminacy '' that is `` ontic '' @xcite , * steven french and decio krause s `` ontic vagueness '' @xcite , * paul teller s `` relational holism '' @xcite , and so forth .",
    "indeed , the idea that a quantum state is in some sense blurred or like a cloud is now rather commonplace even in the popular literature .",
    "thus the idea of objective indefiniteness ( described in various ways ) is hardly new . our goal is to give the mathematical backstory to indefiniteness by showing how the mathematical framework of qm can be built up or developed starting with the ( new ) mathematical logic appropriate for indefiniteness that is duality - related to the usual boolean logic associated with classical definiteness .",
    "how can indefiniteness be depicted mathematically ?",
    "the basic idea is simple ; start with what is taken as full definiteness and then factor or quotient out the surplus definiteness using an equivalence relation or partition .    starting with some universe set @xmath2 of fully distinct and definite elements , a partition @xmath3 ( i.e. , a set of disjoint blocks @xmath4 that sum to @xmath2 ) collects together in a block ( or cell ) @xmath4 the distinct elements @xmath5",
    "whose distinctness is to be ignored or factored out , but the blocks are still distinct from each other .",
    "each block represents the elements that are the same in some respect ( since each block is an equivalence class in the associated equivalence relation on @xmath2 ) , so the block is indefinite between the elements within it .",
    "but different blocks are still distinct from each other in that aspect .",
    "consider the calculation of the binomial coefficient @xmath6 .",
    "the idea is to count the number of @xmath7-ary subsets of an @xmath8-ary set ( @xmath9 ) where the different orderings of the otherwise same @xmath7-ary subset are surplus that need to be factored out .",
    "the method of calculation is to first count the number of possible orderings of the whole @xmath8-ary subset which is @xmath10 .",
    "then we want to quotient out the cases that are distinct only because of different orderings . for any given ordering of the @xmath8 elements ,",
    "there are @xmath11 ways to permute the first @xmath7 elements in the given ordering  leaving the last @xmath12 elements the same .",
    "thus we take the first quotient by identifying any two of the @xmath13 different orderings if they differ only in a permutation of those first @xmath7 elements . since there are @xmath11 such permutations , there are now @xmath14 equivalence classes or blocks in the resulting partition of the @xmath13 orderings .",
    "but these equivalence classes still count as distinct the different orderings of the last @xmath12 elements so we further identify blocks which just have a permutation of the last @xmath12 elements to make larger blocks .",
    "then the result is @xmath6 blocks in the partition which is the number of @xmath7-element subsets ( which equals the number of @xmath12-element subsets ) out of an @xmath8-ary set disregarding the ordering of the elements .    in this example , the set of fully determinate alternatives are the @xmath13 orderings of the @xmath8-element set .",
    "then to consider the subsets of determinate or definite cardinality @xmath7 ( and thus the complementary subsets of definite cardinality @xmath12 ) , we must quotient out the number of possible orderings @xmath11 and @xmath15 to render the ordering of the elements in the subsets indefinite or indeterminate .    to be concrete , consider a set @xmath16 of @xmath17 elements so the universe @xmath2 for fully distinct orderings has @xmath18 elements @xmath19 .",
    "how many @xmath20-element subsets are there ?",
    "the first quotient groups together or identifies the orderings which only permute the first @xmath21 elements so two of the blocks in that partition are @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and there are @xmath24 such blocks .",
    "each block has the same final @xmath25 elements in the ordering so we further identify the blocks that differ only in a permutation of those last @xmath12 elements .",
    "one of the blocks in that final partition is @xmath26 and there are @xmath27 such blocks with four elements in each block .",
    "each block is distinct from the other blocks in the first @xmath7 elements and in the last @xmath12 elements of the orderings in the block so the block count is just the number of subsets of @xmath7 elements ( which equals the number of subsets of @xmath12 elements as well ) where each block is indefinite as to the ordering of elements within the first @xmath7 elements and within the last @xmath12 elements .",
    "hermann weyl makes the same point using an example slightly more complicated than the binomial coefficient .",
    "he starts with a set or `` aggregate @xmath28 ... of elements each of which is in a definite state '' @xcite and then considers a partition or equivalence relation whose @xmath29 blocks or classes @xmath30 can be thought of as boxes into which the @xmath31 elements of @xmath28 may be placed ( some boxes might be empty ) .",

    "a state objectively indefinite between certain definite orthogonal alternatives @xmath44 and @xmath45 , where the latter are represented by vectors @xmath353 and @xmath354 , is represented by the vector sum @xmath355 . but what is the `` strength , '' `` intensity , '' or relative importance of the vectors @xmath353 and @xmath354 in the vector sum @xmath356 ? that question requires a _ scalar _ measure of strength or intensity .",
    "the magnitude given by the norm does not answer the question since @xmath357 .",
    "but the pythagorean theorem shows that the norm - squared gives the scalar measure of `` intensity '' that answers the question : @xmath358 in vector spaces over @xmath1 or over @xmath0 . and",
    "when the objectively indefinite superposition state is decohered by a distinction - making measurement , then the _ objective probability _ that the indefinite state will reduce to one of the definite alternatives is given by that objective relative scalar measure of the eigen - alternative s `` strength , '' `` intensity , '' or importance in the indefinite state  and that is the born rule . in a slogan ,",
    "born is the son of pythagoras .      the pythagorean results ( for the complete and orthogonal projection operators ) :    @xmath359 and @xmath360 ,    give the probabilities for measuring attributes . since by the pythagorean theorem :    @xmath361 ,    we have in full qm and in qm / sets :    @xmath362 and @xmath363 .",

    "thus the set - version of the born rule is not some weird quantum notion of probability on sets but the perfectly ordinary laplace - boole rule for the conditional probability @xmath367 , given @xmath42 , of a random variable @xmath115 having the value @xmath148 .",

    "logical _ finite probability theory @xcite , the correspondence with the right - side of the table gives precision to the thesis that the mathematics of qm is a type of _ logical probability calculus complexified in hilbert spaces_. for instance , the equiprobability or indifference principle of that classical logical finite probability calculus  that is , the equality of all non - zero coefficients in a vector over @xmath1generalizes to the qm probability calculus using the coefficients of vectors over @xmath0 , and the born rule applies to orthogonal decompositions in both cases . crossing the sets - vector - space bridge the other way , we have seen that the classical logical probability calculus ( in its non - commutative version ) is a type of quantum mechanics over sets .",
    "when some particularly mysterious process like measurement can be clearly and distinctly modeled in qm / sets , then it casts some sense - making light back on full qm .",
    "a good example is von neumann s distinction between type 1 measurement - like processes and type 2 processes of unitary evolution @xcite . in qm / sets ,",
    "we have seen that measurement is a distinction - making process described by the partition join operation . in terms of the lattice of set partitions , such a `` type 1 '' process moves up in the lattice to more refined partitions .",
    "is _ more ( or equally ) refined _ than @xmath108 , denoted @xmath410 , if for each @xmath411 , there is a @xmath412 such that @xmath413 , _ is _ just the inclusion relation on distinctions , i.e. , @xmath414 iff @xmath415 , so moving up in the ordering means making more distinctions . ]",
    "this means in qm / sets that a `` type 2 '' evolution would be a distinction - preserving process that , as it were , moves horizontally in the lattice of partitions .",
    "fig8-type1-2processes.eps    figure 8 : `` type 1 '' distinction - making and `` type 2 '' distinction - preserving processes in qm / sets    a linear transformation @xmath416 that keeps distinct vectors distinct ( i.e. , preserves distinctions ) is just a non - singular transformation .",
    "are the non - singular linear transformations ( @xcite and @xcite ) . ]",
    "this means that a type 2 process in full qm should be a process that preserves the degree of distinctness and indistinctness .",
    "given two normalized quantum states @xmath387 and @xmath388 , the brackets @xmath417 can be interpreted as the degree of indistinctness ( or identification ) of the states with the extreme values of @xmath418 for full indistinctness or identification , i.e. , @xmath419 , and @xmath420 for zero indistinctness , i.e. , the full distinctness of orthogonality .",
    "hence under this partitional approach to understanding or making sense of qm , the distinction - preserving type 2 processes are the ones that preserve the degree of indistinctness @xmath421 , i.e. , the unitary transformations . thus by this approach",
    ", we can philosophically derive the mathematical form of the indistinctness - preserving transformations in full qm .",
    "moreover , by stone s theorem in mathematics , those unitary transformations are given by ( the complex exponential of ) a hermitian operator @xmath422 that would describe how the `` substance '' changes to preserve indistinctness .",
    "the partitional follow - the - math approach to understanding qm shows that the mathematical form of full qm is a type of logical probability system expressed in terms of vector spaces rather than sets ( the usual setting for logic and the laplace - boole logical probability theory ) .",
    "but at some point this mathematical metaphysics has to pass the torch to physics to give empirical content to the formalism .",
    "as previously noted , heisenberg tells us that `` substance '' is energy , but this `` follow the partitional math '' approach to making sense out of qm of course can not derive that physical fact nor the form of the operator @xmath422 ( `` h '' as in hamiltonian ) for a physical system",
    ".    there has been much concern and mystery in the foundations of quantum mechanics about the type 1 measurement processes  in contrast to the clarity of describing the type 2 processes as unitary transformations .",
    "that is another old question .",
    "we have seen that this question can be answered at the _ mathematical _ level by the partition join operation .",
    "the mathematical description of a measurement in qm / sets as the join of compatible set - partitions lifts to the mathematical description of a measurement in full qm as the join of compatible vector - space partitions  where one partition describes the distinction - making measurement apparatus representing the observable being measured and the other partition is the indiscrete ( i.e. , one block ) partition representing the given pure state to be measured or , better , to be decohered . using",
    "the respective partition join operations , a complete set of compatible attributes ( csca ) gives a non - degenerate measurement in qm / sets , and a complete set of commuting operators ( csco ) gives a non - degenerate measurement in full qm .",
    "thus the clear and distinct distinction between `` type 1 '' distinction - making and `` type 2 '' distinction - preserving processes in the pedagogical model of qm / sets makes sense of the von neumann type 1 distinction - making measurements and type 2 distinction - preserving unitary transformations in full qm .",
    "there are two meta - physical visions of reality suggested by classical physics ( objectively definite reality ) and by quantum physics ( objectively indefinite reality ) .",
    "the problem of interpreting qm is essentially the problem of making sense out of the notion of objective indefiniteness . our sense - making strategy was to follow the lead of the mathematics .",
    "the definiteness of classical physics is associated with the notion of a subset and is logically expressed in the classical boolean logic of subsets .",
    "the indefiniteness of quantum physics is associated with the notion of a quotient set , equivalence relation , or partition , and the corresponding logic is the recently developed logic of partitions @xcite . moreover ,",
    "those associated notions of subsets and quotient sets are category - theoretically dual to one another , so _ from that viewpoint _ , those are _ the only _ two possible frameworks to describe reality .",
    "common sense and classical physics assumes the objectively definite type of reality , but quantum physics strongly indicates an objectively indefinite reality at the quantum level .",
    "hence our approach to interpreting quantum mechanics is not flights of fantasy ( e.g. , about many worlds or realms of hidden variables ) but is trying to make sense out of objective indefiniteness .    our sense - making strategy",
    "was implemented by developing the mathematics and logic of partitions at the connected conceptual levels of sets and vector spaces .",
    "set concepts are transported to complex vector spaces to yield the mathematical machinery of full qm , and the complex vector space concepts of full qm are transported to the set - like vector spaces over @xmath1 to yield the rather fulsome pedagogical model of quantum mechanics over sets or qm / sets .",
