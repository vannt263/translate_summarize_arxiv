    "luminosity density from the drg progenitors decreases by a factor of @xmath192 from @xmath1@xmath22 to 6 .",
    "it is interesting to ask what the stellar  population models imply for the luminosities of the progenitors of the goods ",

    "figure  [ fig : example_pastsfr ] shows the past sfr for the drg in figure  [ fig : example_spec ] for the best - fitting models using the two different star  formation histories ( see   [ section : modeling ] , figure  [ fig : example_spec ] ) . the dashed line shows the past uv luminosity for the model with a monotonically evolving sfr .",

    "the sample is approximate complete ( i.e. , nearly volume limited ) for passively evolving galaxies .",
    "the figure also shows intantaneous measurements of the uv luminosity density at @xmath1@xmath236 from @xcite and @xcite using lbgs . comparing the measured uv luminosity density to what we infer from the past output from the drgs ,",
    "if the massive drgs at 2@xmath47@xmath1@xmath473 formed their stellar populations with a monotonically evolving sfr , then they account for @xmath475% of the @xmath1@xmath26 uv luminosity density .",

    "stochastic bursts throughout their lifetime , then they account for @xmath191015% of the @xmath1@xmath26 uv luminosity density .",
    "inverting that statement , roughly 1015% of the stars formed in @xmath1@xmath26 galaxies end up in massive drgs at 2@xmath47@xmath1@xmath473 .",
    "we can go one step further and impose the constraint that the stars forming at @xmath1@xmath26 can not _ overproduce _ the stellar mass at @xmath1@xmath223 . in this case",
    "the data allow us to place a very loose constraint on the imf of the old stellar populations in the drgs .",
    "if the past imf in these galaxies is weighted to high  mass stars ( e.g. , with a slope shallower than salpeter , @xmath48@xmath471.35 ) , then one gets more uv photons produced for a given amount of formed stellar mass ( more `` bang for the buck '' ) .",
    "the rate that the light from a stellar population fades goes as @xmath49 .",
    "we approximate the change in the past uv luminosity for a varying imf by scaling the past uv luminosity by the change in @xmath50band luminosity . for a salpeter imf @xmath51 , whereas a `` flat '' imf ( with slope @xmath48=0.0 ) has @xmath52 . if the old stellar populations formed with a top ",

    "if the measured @xmath1@xmath26 uv luminosity density is in fact lower , then the stellar mass in the drgs can account for all @xcite , or more @xcite than what can be formed with a @xmath48=0.0 imf .",
    "therefore , if the uv luminosity density is lower than the giavalisco et al . , ( 2004b ) value , then the imf _ must _ have a slope @xmath48@xmath00.0 to avoid the awkward situation that the @xmath1@xmath66 galaxies overproduce the stellar mass in drgs with 2@xmath47@xmath1@xmath473 and @xmath5@xmath8@xmath7  .",
    "such a situation seems extreme .",
    "it is possible that the massive drgs contain a large amount of the stars formed at @xmath1@xmath26 .",
    "currently , we have only the limited constraint that the slope of the imf of the @xmath1@xmath26 star  forming galaxies is @xmath48@xmath00.0 .",
    "this may be tightened as the observations of the @xmath1@xmath66 uv luminosity density improve ( or we decrease the uncertainty in the stellar  population modeling ) .",
    "moreover , the constraint will be better if we can measure the uv luminosity density at yet higher redshift .",
    "for example , bouwens et al . , ( 2004 ) suggest that the @xmath1@xmath278 uv luminosity density is lower than at @xmath1@xmath26 by an order of magnitude . in this case ,",
    "based on figure  [ fig : pastsfr ] we may already be able to discard an imf with a very shallow slope .",
    "we may yet achieve indirect constraints on the imf of high  redshift galaxies at the epoch of reionization using the old stellar populations we find at `` low '' redshifts , @xmath1@xmath223 .",
