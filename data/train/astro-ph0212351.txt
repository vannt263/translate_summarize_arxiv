    "it is generally accepted that the galaxy is constituted by four discrete main components , the _ bulge _ , the _ thin disk _ , the _ thick disk _ and the _ halo _ , which are characterized by distinctive stellar populations in terms of spatial distribution , kinematics properties , metallicity and age . a detailed knowledge of such galactic components is essential to achieve a complete description of the milky way , as well as of the various processes and evolutionary phases which occurred during the history of our galaxy ( and other galaxies too ) and that are responsible for the existence and the properties of those components we observe today .",
    "ground based surveys providing photometry , proper motions and/or spectroscopic observations have been carried out in the past to study the structure and kinematics of galactic populations , and these will continue and be extended in the next years thanks to availability of all - sky catalogs such as gsc - ii and usno - b , based on multi - epoch photographic surveys , as well as other current and future photometric and spectroscopic surveys ( eg .  2mass , denis , sdss , eis , he s , hk , vst , etc . )",
    "that benefit from the availability of dedicated scanning and large field cameras as well as large multi - fiber spectrographs ( eg .",
    "2df , 6df , flames ) .",
    "clearly , the gaia mission will provide an enormous contribution to the understanding of the formation and evolution of the galaxy , thanks to very accurate astrometric parameters complemented by photometric and spectroscopic measurements which will permit the direct determination of the 6d phase space distribution and the chemical abundance of large and complete samples of stellar tracers belonging to the different galactic components .    here",
    "we describe a new project which combines astrometric , photometric and spectroscopic data in order to investigate the kinematics of the outer halo by means of velocities derived from proper motions and radial velocities for a sample of rr - lyr and bhb giants towards the ngp .",
    "at the moment we have surveyed about 200 square degrees towards the ngp , and produced positions , proper motions and photographic photometry for about 500000 objects down to plate limits ( r@xmath0 ) .",

    "all plates were digitized at stsci utilizing modified pds - type scanning machines with 25 @xmath1 m square pixels ( 1.7 @xmath7/pixel ) for the first epoch plates , and 15 @xmath1 m pixels ( 1 @xmath7/pixel ) for the second epoch plates .",
    "the digital copies of the plates were initially analyzed by means of the standard software pipeline used for the construction of the gsc - ii ( see e.g.  lasker et al .",
    "1995 or mclean et al .",
    "the pipeline performs object detection and computes parameters and features for each identified object .",
    "further , the software provides classification , position , and magnitude for each object by means of astrometric and photometric calibrations which utilized the tycho2 ( hg et al .",
    "2000 ) and the gspc-2 ( bucciarelli et al . 2001 ) as reference catalogs .",
    "accuracies better than 0.1 - 0.2 arcsec in position and 0.15 - 0.2 mag in photographic magnitude are generally attained .",

    "the data were processed with standard procedures and routines ( iraf ) , and typical errors are @xmath10 km s@xmath11 and @xmath12}\\sim 0.2 $ ] dex .",
    "the color magnitude diagram and the vector point diagram observed in one field of our ngp survey are shown in figure 2 .",
    "the observed distributions are the result of the complex mixture of the stars belonging to the various populations which are present towards high galactic latitudes .",
    "in particular , these may include :    1 .",
    "the flat and rapidly rotating old thin disk , 2 .   the extended thick disk , including its metal weak tail , 3 .",
    "a flattened and slowly rotating inner halo , 4 .   a spheroidal non - rotating outer halo , 5 .",
    "satellite debris and kinematics substructures .    actually , the physical properties of these components are not completely established and various problems are still controversial .",
    "for instance : @xmath13 the density scale factor , rotation and metallicity distribution of the thick disk ; @xmath14 the nature of the metal weak thick disk ( mwtd ) and its relation with the standard thick disk ( satellite debris or initial phase of a dissipative formation ? ) ; @xmath15 the halo velocity ellipsoid , the spatial distribution and axial ratio of the halo as a function of the distance , @xmath16 the search of halo streams ; @xmath17 the determination of the luminosity and mass function of the faintest pop.ii stars ( white dwarfs , late m dwarfs and subdwarfs ) .    due to the lack of trigonometric parallaxes for our and similar surveys , accurate distances and tangential velocities can not be directly determined .",
    "in such a case it is convenient to analyze these large data - sets by comparing the observations against _ ad hoc _ galaxy models which describe both the density and kinematics , as for instance the besanon model ( robin & oblak 1987 ) , the ias galaxy model ( bachall , casertano & ratnatunga 1987 ) , or the models developed by mendez & van altena ( 1996 ) and chen ( 1997 ) . to this regard , in figure 3 starcounts are compared against the mendez s galaxy model which has been extended to the photographic b@xmath3 and r@xmath4 magnitudes by spagna ( 2001 ) .    alternatively ,",
    "using tracers with known brightness , it is possible to derive distance and space velocity by means of photometry , proper motions and spectroscopic radial velocities .",
    "this approach has been adopted to investigate the kinematics of the outer halo traced by a set of 31 rr lyr and 65 bhb giants , as will be discussed in the following section .",
    "these objects are distributed between @xmath18 kpc ( v=12 - 16.5 mag ) and accurate photometric parallaxes ( @xmath19% ) have been computed by means of the m@xmath20 vs.  b  v relation for bhb giants derived by preston et al .",

    "finally , the extinction e(b  v ) has been estimated from the maps of schlegel et al .",
    "a retrograde rotation of the outer halo has been suggested by majewski ( 1992 ) who measured a mean velocity @xmath27 km s@xmath11 , which corresponds to a galactocentric retrograde velocity @xmath28 km s@xmath11 adopting @xmath29 km s@xmath11 , from the analysis of a pure sample of halo subdwarfs at @xmath30 kpc towards the ngp . as shown in table 2 , this parameter is still controversial , in fact carney ( 1999 ) , after correcting the kinematics bias of his kinematically - selected subdwarf sample , found a net prograde rotation of about @xmath31 km s@xmath11 . on the contrary , chiba & beers ( 2000 )",

    "( 2002 ) , who carried out a spectroscopic survey at intermediate galactic latitudes of about 2000 f / g stars , revealed a significant excess of _ retrograde _ halo stars in their faintest magnitude bin ( @xmath57 ) corresponding to a vertical distance @xmath58 kpc .",
    "the fact that the velocities of halo stars do not match an exact gaussian distribution is well known ( see eg .",
    "martin & morrison 1998 ) .",
    "how much this depends on the properties of the whole population or on the effects of kinematic substructures , such as satellite debris of ancient accretion events ( eg .",
    "helmi et al.1999 ) , remains to be established .    as shown in table 2 , a preliminary analysis of our sample of rr lyr and bhb giants ( kinman et al .",
    "2002 ) seems to support a retrograde rotation of the outer halo .",
    "in fact , we measured a heliocentric velocity @xmath59 km s@xmath11 , which corresponds to @xmath60 km s@xmath11 adopting a solar motion with respect to the lsr , @xmath61 km s@xmath11 , from dehnen & binney ( 1998 ) and assuming @xmath29 km s@xmath11 .",
    "this result is confirmed also by the separate analysis of the rr lyr and bhb giants , which both provide a retrograde rotation .",
    "how much this value may be affected by a velocity bias can be estimated by the level of systematic errors on proper motions which in practice give the main contribution to the @xmath62 and @xmath63 galactic components along this line of sight towards @xmath64 . as reported in sect .  2",
    ", we found systematic errors @xmath65 mas / yr , from which velocity bias up to 20 - 30 km s@xmath11 can be expected for such stars located at @xmath66 - 6 kpc , on average .",
    "clearly , this is a critical point which need further analysis .",
    "a montecarlo simulation has been developed in order to compare the gaia capability to recover the halo kinematics with respect to the velocity precision that can be attained by the current and future ground based surveys .",
    "for simplicity we considered an uniform spatial distribution with pop.ii-like kinematics , @xmath67 km  s@xmath11 and an observer rotating with a velocity of 220 km  s@xmath11 at a distance of 8 kpc from the galactic center .",
    "implicitly we assumed to measure bright tracers , such as rr lyr , bhb and red giants , having apparent magnitude @xmath68 mag at a distance of about @xmath69 kpc .",
    "the following cases were tested :    * case a ( gaia ) , with @xmath70 @xmath1as , @xmath71 @xmath1as  yr@xmath11 ( per component ) and @xmath72 km  s@xmath11 , from astrometric and spectroscopic observations ; * case b ( ground - based surveys ) , with @xmath73 mag , @xmath74 mas  yr@xmath11 ( per component ) and @xmath72 km s@xmath11 , from astrometric , photometric and spectroscopic observations .    note that the two cases differ essentially in a factor 100 on the proper motion accuracy .",
    "in fact , at @xmath75 kpc the distance accuracy is the same for both cases .",
    "this points out the fact that , although radial velocities and distance moduli derived from ground based spectro - photometric surveys can attain similar accuracy , gaia astrometry will uniquely provide accurate and reliable tangential velocities up to large distances .",
    "figure 4 shows the results of montecarlo simulations with 5000 stars towards @xmath76 .",
    "top panels present the velocity errors ( i.e.  the differences between the observed velocity and the true value ) for case a , and those at the bottom for case b. as expected , errors increase linearly with distance , and for gaia the rms of @xmath77 and @xmath78 residuals vary from @xmath75 km  s@xmath11 at 5 kpc to 20 - 30 km  s@xmath11 at 10 kpc . for case b the errors on u and v are about a factor 2 - 3 larger , while @xmath79 km  s@xmath11 in both the cases . note that in case a the error on the tangential velocity is in practice dominated by the distance uncertainty , @xmath80 , while both the errors on proper motions and photometric parallaxes contribute to the velocity errors of case b. similar results are derived in other directions .",
    "these velocity errors should be compared with the typical motion of the halo stars ( 100 - 200 km  s@xmath11 ) for which gaia will provide individual 3d spatial velocities with a significant signal - to - noise , @xmath81 , up to @xmath82 - 15 kpc , a distance where ground based surveys are not able to measure reliable tangential velocities .",
    "gaia will measure direct distances and velocities for large samples of halo tracers , selected _ in situ _ without kinematics nor metallicity bias , from which it will possible to determine accurately the halo velocity ellipsoid and its orientation .",
    "in particular , the gaia @xmath1-arcsec level accuracy will be essential in order to take advantage of the @xmath83 statistical factor and avoid the risk of velocity biases due to the presence of systematics errors affecting proper motions and parallaxes as discussed in sect .",
    "4 .    finally , accuracy of the order of 15 - 20 km  s@xmath11 , such as that attained by gaia for @xmath84 kpc , is the value requested to resolve kinematics substructures in the halo , as the satellite debris predicted by the hierarchical scenarios of galaxy formation . to",
    "this regards , helmi ( 2002 ) estimated that gaia will be able to recover 2/3 of the accretion events with a velocity accuracy better than 20 km  s@xmath11 and @xmath85 20% down to @xmath86 , or 1/2 of the events down to @xmath87 mag .",
    "large field proper motion surveys ( @xmath88 1 - 10 mas / yr ) based on photographic surveys digitized with fast measuring machines ( aps , mama , pds , pmm , supercosmos ) are still useful tools for the study of the structure and kinematics of the galactic stellar populations , especially when combined with radial velocities and chemical abundances from spectro - photometric observations . in particular , we have shown how bright halo tracers , such as bhb giants and rr lyr stars with @xmath89 - 17 , can be used to investigate _ in situ _ the halo kinematics up to @xmath90 - 6 kpc via photometric parallaxes if proper motions with @xmath91 - 2 mas / yr accuracy and radial velocities with precision of about @xmath92 - 20 km  s@xmath11 are available . for statistical analysis of large samples , systematic errors on the proper motions ( and @xmath21 too )",
    "are critical and can result in biased mean velocities and dispersions .",
    "these problems will be dramatically reduced by the astrometric parameters and spectroscopic @xmath93 provided by gaia , which will permit to determine @xmath13 direct distances from parallaxes , @xmath14 radial and tangential velocities with an accuracy of a few tens of km  s@xmath11 to @xmath69 - 15 kpc for @xmath15 unbiased and larger sets of tracers identified by means of its spectro - photometric and astrometric data .",
