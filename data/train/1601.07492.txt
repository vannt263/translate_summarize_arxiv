    "the study of quantum entanglement provides a powerful tool to analyze the many - body states in condensed matter physics@xcite . the most celebrated measure of entanglement",
    "is given by the entanglement entropy ( von neumann entropy ) @xmath0 of the reduced density matrix of the subsystem @xmath1 .",
    "this quantity measures the entanglement between two complementary subsystems @xmath1 and @xmath2 , when the total system is in a pure state .",
    "one remarkably common result is an area law behavior of the entanglement entropy in gapped systems , which grows proportionally with the boundary between two subsystems@xcite .",
    "an important exception is the one - dimensional systems at criticality , where the entanglement entropy has a logarithmic scaling behavior@xcite and have been understood by use of a conformal field theory ( cft ) approach@xcite .",
    "however , using the entanglement entropy as a probe to diagonalize the entanglement for a mixed state is a difficult task .",
    "it requires a heavy optimization process .",
    "hence , an alternative measure of entanglement for a mixed state has been proposed ",
    "the entanglement negativity@xcite .",
    "the advantage of using entanglement negativity is that it only requires linear algebraic computations .",
    "the entanglement negativity is defined as follows .",
    "suppose a tripartite system is divided into @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath2 subsystems .",
    "the ground state after tracing out the degrees of freedom in a @xmath2 subsystem is a general mixed state .",
    "the entanglement negativity , which quantifies the entanglement between @xmath3 and @xmath4 , is obtained by partially transposing ( with respect to the degrees of freedom in @xmath4 ) the reduced density matrix @xmath5 , which is denoted as @xmath6 .",
    "then the entanglement negativity between subsystems @xmath3 and @xmath4 is defined as @xmath7 where the trace norm @xmath8 represents the sum of all absolute values of the eigenvalues of @xmath9 .",
    "recently , the entanglement negativity has been extensively studied in numerous many - body systems , e.g. , harmonic oscillators in one dimension@xcite , quantum spin chains@xcite , systems with topological orders @xcite , and ( 2 + 1 ) dimensional chern - simons theories@xcite . a cft approach@xcite and many useful numerical methods",
    "are also developed , including tree tensor techniques@xcite , monte carlo simulations@xcite , and rational interpolations@xcite .",
    "further studies on non - equilibrium situations@xcite and finite temperature@xcite refine our understanding of the entanglement negativity .    in this work ,",
    "we demonstrate a systematical way to compute the entanglement negativity in free - fermion systems by using the overlap matrices . for the prior works on entanglement negativity in free fermion systems@xcite , the quantities people calculated are the moments of partially transposed reduced denity matrix @xmath10 , with @xmath11 .",
    "in other words , the entanglement negativity , which is obtained from the trace norm @xmath12 , has not been computed in the prior works due to reasons of technical difficulty . in our work",
    ", we will give an explicit calculation of @xmath12 by using the overlap matrices , and therefore the entanglement negativity is obtained .",

    "we show that for a tripartite system , when the overlap matrices @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 can be simultaneously diagonalized , the ground state of fermions can be factored into triples of modes .",
    "in this situation , the partially transposed reduced density matrix can be factorized and the entanglement negativity can be obtained from the spectra of the overlap matrices . on the other hand ,",
    "when the simultaneous diagonalizability of the overlap matrices does not hold , the factorability of the ground state in a tripartite system is failed . in this situation",
    ", the partially transposed reduced density matrix can only be expressed in terms of the kronecker product of matrices",
    ". then the entanglement negativity is directly obtained from the partially transposed reduced density matrix .",
    "the overlap matrix approach provides a systematical way to calculate the entanglement negativity in any free - fermion systems , which can be either gapped topological phases or critical systems .",
