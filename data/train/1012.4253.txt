    "one of the most fascinating subjects in condensed matter physics is the study of the resistivity encountered by conduction electrons in crystals .",
    "fifty years ago , the effect of the magnetic ordering of the crystal on the electron resistivity began to attract investigations .",
    "it has been shown that at very low temperature ( @xmath4 ) the resistivity is dominated by spin - wave scattering , the spin resistivity @xmath3 is then proportional to @xmath5 in ferromagnets.@xcite in the region of the ferromagnetic phase transition , @xmath3 shows a peak at the transition temperature @xmath6 similar to the magnetic susceptibility .",
    "de gennes and friedel@xcite have suggested that this behavior is due to the spin - spin correlation .",
    "several approximations have been used to treat this correlation appearing in several formulations,@xcite in particular in the boltzmann s equation.@xcite recently , we have introduced a monte carlo ( mc ) simulation technique to deal with the spin resistivity .",
    "our results for ferromagnets are in agreement with other theories , in particular the existence of the peak at @xmath6 and its dependence on the strength of magnetic field and density of itinerant spins.@xcite in unfrustrated antiferromagnets , there has been a few investigations .",
    "some theories predicted the absence of a sharp peak at @xmath6.@xcite we have shown by mc simulations that this is true , however the form of the rounded peak depends on the crystal structure and other interaction parameters.@xcite    experimentally , there has been a large number of works dealing with the spin resistivity in different magnetic compounds.@xcite these experiments show the existence of an anomaly of @xmath3 at the magnetic phase transition .",
    "the shape of this anomaly depends on the material .",
    "one class of interesting magnetic systems is called `` frustrated systems '' introduced in the 1970s in the context of spin glasses .",
    "these frustrated systems are very unstable due to the competition between different kinds of interaction .",
    "however they are periodically defined ( no disorder ) and therefore subject to exact treatments .",
    "this is the case of several models in two dimensions@xcite , but in three dimensions frustrated systems are far from being understood even on basic properties such as the order of the phase transition ( first or second order , values of critical exponents , ... ) .",
    "let us recall the definition of a frustrated system .",
    "when a spin can not fully satisfy energetically all the interactions with its neighbors , it is `` frustrated '' .",
    "this occurs when the interactions are in competition with each other or when the lattice geometry does not allow to satisfy all interaction bonds simultaneously .",
    "a well - known example is the stacked triangular lattice with antiferromagnetic interaction between nearest - neighbors .",
    "the frustration in spin systems causes many unusual properties such as large ground state ( gs ) degeneracy , successive phase transitions with complicated nature , partially disordered phases , reentrance and disorder lines .",
    "frustrated systems still constitute at present a challenge for investigation methods . for recent reviews ,",
    "the reader is referred to ref .",
    "@xcite .    motivated by their exotic behaviors",
    ", we have studied some frustrated systems and found that @xmath3 depends drastically on the range of interaction , and that @xmath3 shows a discontinuity at @xmath6 reflecting the first - order character of the phase transition.@xcite    this work aims at confirming the fact that in systems with first - order transitions , @xmath3 should have a discontinuity at @xmath6 . for that purpose ,",
    "we consider in this paper so - called @xmath0 simple cubic lattice with ising spins .",
    "this system is known to undergo a very strong first - order transition in the heisenberg case.@xcite the ising case studied here shows also a very strong first - order transition as shown below .    in section 2",
    ", we present our model and mc method . the results are shown in section 3 .",
    "concluding remarks are given in section 4 .",
    "we consider the simple cubic lattice shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] .",
    "the spins are the classical ising model of magnitude @xmath7 .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the ising spin at the lattice site @xmath10 , @xmath11 is made over the nn spin pairs @xmath9 and @xmath12 with interaction @xmath1 , while @xmath13 is performed over the nnn pairs with interaction @xmath2 .",
    "we are interested in the frustrated regime .",
    "therefore , hereafter we suppose that @xmath14 ( @xmath15 , antiferromagnetic interaction , and @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a positive parameter .",
    "the ground state ( gs ) of this system is easy to obtain either by minimizing the energy , or by comparing the energies of different spin configurations , or just a numerical minimizing by a steepest descent method.@xcite we obtain the antiferromagnetic ( af ) configuration shown by the upper figure of fig .",
    "[ fig : sc ] for @xmath18 , or the configuration shown in the lower figure for @xmath19 .",
    "note that this latter configuration is 3-fold degenerate by putting the parallel nn spins on @xmath20 , @xmath21 or @xmath22 axis . with the permutation of black and white spins ,",
    "the total degeneracy is thus 6 .",
    "the phase transition of this model in the frustrated region ( @xmath19 ) has been studied by pinettes and diep@xcite in the case of the heisenberg model .",
    "it has been found that the transition is strongly of first order .",
    "the ordered phase is very unstable due to its degeneracy .",
    "as will be shown below , the case of the ising case shows an even stronger first - order transition .",
    "it is therefore interesting to investigate the resistivity of itinerant spins traveling across of such a system .",
    "the model we use here to study the spin transport takes into account the following interactions :    * interaction between lattice spins given by eq .",
    "( [ hl ] ) * interaction between itinerant spins and lattice spins given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the ising spin of itinerant electron and @xmath25 denotes the interaction that depends on the distance between an electron @xmath10 and the spin @xmath26 at the lattice site @xmath27 .",
    "we use the following interaction expression : @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are constants which will be chosen in section [ choice ] .",
    "* interaction between itinerant spins : in the same way , interaction between itinerant electrons is defined by @xmath31 with @xmath24 the spin of itinerant electron and @xmath32 the interaction that depends on the distance between electrons @xmath10 and @xmath27 . the choice of the constants @xmath33 and @xmath34 is discussed in [ choice ] .",
    "* chemical potential term : since the interaction between itinerant electron spins is attractive , we need to add a chemical potential in order to avoid a possible collapse of electrons into some points in the crystal and to ensure a homogeneous distribution of electrons during the simulation . the chemical potential term is given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the concentration of itinerant spins in the sphere of @xmath37 radius , centered at @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath39 is a constant parameter appropriately chosen . *",
    "electric field term : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the charge of electron , @xmath42 the applied electrical field and @xmath43 the displacement vector of an electron .",
    "+      note that the effect of the crystal magnetic ordering on the resistivity is dominated by the first two interactions .",
    "we will show below results obtained for typical values of parameters .",
    "the choice of the parameters has been made after numerous test runs .",
    "we describe the principal requirements which guide the choice :    \\i ) we choose the interaction between lattice spins as unity , i. e. @xmath44 .",
    "\\ii ) we choose interaction between an itinerant and its surrounding lattice spins so as its energy @xmath45 in the low @xmath4 region is the same order of magnitude with that between lattice spins .",
    "to simplify , we take @xmath46 .",
    "\\iii ) interaction between itinerant spins is chosen so that this contribution to the itinerant spin energy is smaller than @xmath45 in order to highlight the effect of the lattice ordering on the spin current . to simplify , we take @xmath47 .",
    "\\iv ) the choice of @xmath39 is made in such a way to avoid the formation of clusters of itinerant spins ( collapse ) due to their attractive interaction [ eq .",
    "( [ k ] ) ] .",
    "\\v ) the electric field is chosen not so strong in order to avoid its dominant effect that would mask the effects of thermal fluctuations and of the magnetic ordering .",
    "\\vi ) the density of the itinerant spins is chosen in a way that the contribution of interactions between themselves is neither so weak nor so strong with respect to @xmath45 .    within these requirements ,",
    "a variation of each parameter does not change qualitatively the results shown below .",
    "as will be seen , only the variation of @xmath48 does change drastically the results .",
    "that is the reason why we will study in detail the effect of this parameter . for larger densities of itinerant spins ,",
    "the resistivity is larger as expected because of additional scattering process between itinerant spins .",
    "we fix @xmath49 ( af interaction ) for nn coupling of lattice spins as said above .",
    "the energy is thus measured in the unit of @xmath50 .",
    "the temperature is expressed in the unit of @xmath51 .",
    "the distance ( @xmath48 , @xmath37 ) is in the unit of @xmath52 , the lattice constant .",
    "we consider a film with a thickness of @xmath53 cubic cells in the @xmath22 direction .",
    "each of the @xmath54 planes contains @xmath55 cells .",
    "the periodic boundary conditions are used on the @xmath54 planes to ensure that the itinerant electrons who leave the system at the second end are to be reinserted at the first end . for the @xmath22 direction",
    ", we use the mirror reflection at the two surfaces .",
    "these boundary conditions conserve thus the average density of itinerant electrons .",
    "dynamics of itinerant electrons is created by an electric field applied along the @xmath20 axis .",
    "simulations are carried out in the following manner .",
    "the lattice spins are equilibrated at a temperature @xmath4 .",
    "itinerant spins are then injected into the system . before calculating thermal averages of transport properties ,",
    "we equilibrate itinerant spins during a large number of mc steps .",
    "the multi - step averaging procedure has been used to get good statistics:@xcite averaging is made between re - equilibrating periods of lattice and itinerant spins to explore a maximum number of microscopic spin configurations .",
    "we show first the result of the lattice alone , namely without itinerant spins .",
    "the lattice in the frustrated region , i. e. @xmath56 , shows a strong first - order transition as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : me ] : the sublattice magnetization and the energy per spin as functions of @xmath4 for @xmath57 for the lattice size @xmath58 , @xmath59 show a discontinuity at the transition temperature . to check further the first - order nature of the transition",
    ", we have calculated the energy histogram at the transition temperature @xmath6 .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : he ] .",
    "the double - peak structure indicates the coexistence of the ordered and disordered phases at @xmath6 .",
    "the distance between two peaks represents the latent heat .",
    "now we consider the lattice with the presence of itinerant spins .",
    "as far as the interaction between itinerant spins is attractive , we need a chemical potential to avoid the collapse of the system .",
    "the strength of the chemical potential @xmath39 depends on @xmath33 .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : kd ] the collapse phase diagram which allows to choose for a given @xmath33 , an appropriate value of @xmath39 .",
    "we show now the main result on the spin resistivity versus @xmath4 for @xmath60 for several values of @xmath48 .",
    "other parameters are the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig : me ] . as",
    "said in section [ choice ] , within the physical constraints , the variation of most of the parameters does not change qualitatively the physical effects observed in simulations , except for the parameter @xmath48 . due to the af",
    "ordering , increasing @xmath48 means that we include successively neighboring down and up spins surrounding a given itinerant spin . as a consequence , the energy of the itinerant spin oscillates with varying @xmath48 , giving rise to the change of behavior of @xmath3 : @xmath3 can make a down fall or an upward jump at @xmath6 depending on the value of @xmath48 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : r ] . note the discontinuity of @xmath3 at @xmath6 .",
    "this behavior has been observed in the frustrated fcc antiferromagnet.@xcite",
    "from the results shown above for the strongly frustrated @xmath0 model , we conclude that the spin resistivity reflects the nature of the first - order transition : it undergoes a discontinuity at the transition temperature . the fact that as @xmath61 , @xmath3 increases slowly stems from the freezing of itinerant spins with decreasing @xmath4 . this has been experimentally observed in ferromagnets and antiferromagnets as seen in fig .",
