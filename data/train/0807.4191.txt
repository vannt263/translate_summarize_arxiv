    "propagation of short laser pulses in resonant media often falls into an intermediate domain where neither description is satisfactory .",
    "the most important time scale is much longer than the period of the laser field but shorter than the decoherence time of the medium , and the slowly varying envelope and rotating wave approximations are engaged to simplify the description of evolution in this domain @xcite .",
    "however , theories of resonant propagation usually ignore the very real possibility that the state of the medium may be prepared in a way not adequately described by probability ( population ) assignments to the levels . the term ",
    "phaseonium \" was introduced by scully @xcite to describe a three - level atomic medium in the @xmath0 configuration , where two ground levels of the atoms are prepared in a phase - coherent pure - state superposition .",
    "phase coherent effects lead to coherent population trapping @xcite , electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite , pulse matching @xcite , the dark area theorem @xcite , simultons @xcite , and adiabatons @xcite .",
    "these effects are are all governed by dark - state @xcite considerations .",
    "pure phaseonium is not easily prepared experimentally , and the question what effects may acompany more realistic preparation has remained open . here",
    "we report new results obtained for propagation in media that could be called partial phaseonium , or  mixonium \" , because the medium is allowed to have mixed state or partial coherence in its ground state .",
    "the simple cases we study are distinct from traditional eit scenarios in that the ground state coherence is prepared ahead of any pulses entering the medium , while in traditional eit it is the pump and probe pulses which prepare the medium coherence .",
    "methods to prepare a phaseonium medium have been shown for ladder @xcite and @xmath0 @xcite systems .    a previous study @xcite by kozlov and eberly of two - pulse propagation in absorbing media made use of the maxwell - bloch model ( see e.g. @xcite ) , which describes fully coherent pulse propagation through atomic media .",
    "they reported two types of pulse evolution , one similar to that of one - pulse self - induced transparency ( sit ) @xcite , and the other showing a different form of two - pulse evolution under conditions they identified with eit , in which the dark state plays an important role .",
    "they defined the sit - type propagation in three - level media as occurring when the dark state was nearly or completely empty and eit - type propagation as occurring when the dark state was highly populated .",
    "they showed that eit - type dominated sit - type for propagation in a fully coherent phaseonium medium .",
    "however , when a @xmath0 medium is prepared without ground - state phase coherence , the role of the dark state is minimized , and we have shown @xcite that sit - type propagation is dominant .    in realistic experimental preparation ,",
    "pure - state three - level phaseonium is difficult to achieve .",
    "ground state phase coherence can be lost due to environmental decoherence or imperfect preparation techniques .",
    "thus we report new results on two - pulse propagation through a @xmath0 medium that is prepared with the ground states in a partially phase - coherent superposition , between the two extremes of completely mixed or completely pure state , the basis for our term  mixonium \" .",
    "we include a variable parameter @xmath1 in our initial state definition that will allow us to examine the propagation dynamics both analytically and numerically over the entire range from completely mixed to completely pure .",
    "we will follow the previous definition and determine whether it is eit or sit that dominates pulse propagation in mixonium .",
    "we will use a three - regime language to distinguish three propagation zones , similar to our analysis of two - pulse propagation in a completely mixed - state medium @xcite . in the pure phaseonium case the analytic solutions to the maxwel - bloch ( mb ) equations predict that simulton pulses @xcite that begin entirely in the strongly interacting bright state will be transferred into the non - interacting dark state just as one would expect based on coherent population trapping and dark area theorem arguments . if the medium is initially prepared only partially phase - coherent , a similar simulton transfer process occurs .",
    "however the lack of complete phase coherence prohibits the dark state from being fully populated , and the pulses will continue to interact with the ground to excited state transition .",
    "our analytic solutions allow us to determine the maximum population of the dark state , when the medium is not in a pure state .",
    "the inability of the dark state to be fully populated , and the subsequent pulse - medium interaction that continues for non - pure medium preparation causes sit - like effects and reduces the role of eit .",
    "this has dramatic consequences for the pulse matching that occurs in phaseonium .",
    "we find that our analytic solutions have broad predictive capabilities for mixonium due to pulse - reshaping caused by sit . in the phaseonium case our numerical solutions agree with previous studies @xcite predicting temporal pulse matching .",
    "however , in the mixonium case sit begins to play a role because the dark state can not be fully populated .",
    "we find that for long propagation distances sit always dominates in a mixed - state medium . further highlighting this effect",

    "this requires pulse durations on the order of , or shorter than , 1 ns . by making use of the slowly varying envelope approximation and the rotating wave approximation we can reduce maxwell s wave equation to two independent first order wave equations for each individual pulse .",

    "we will consistently assume line - center tuning , so @xmath27 is implied throughout .",

    ".    a single weak pulse presents a familiar case , in which the pulse causes some population exchange between ground and excited states , and even though we neglect homogeneous loss terms , doppler ( or any other inhomogeneous ) broadening serves as a dephasing mechanism .",
    "thus a single weak pulse will be absorbed as it propagates , and its peak intensity will decay exponentially as @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the peak intensity of the weak input pulse and @xmath35 is the doppler absorption depth or beer s length given in ( [ invbeercoeff ] ) .",
    "two separate mechanisms can change these familiar absorptive properties .",
    "these are self - induced transparency ( sit ) which arises from dynamic nonlinearities associated with a strong and coherent pulse , and electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) which arises when a second laser pulse interacts with the same excited state , thus inducing two - photon coherence between two different ground states .",
    "potential physical realizations of such a system include the d line transitions for rubidium or cesium . for the @xmath36 line of rubidium , which we use as our model in this paper ,",
    "the excited state lifetime is around @xmath37 ns and the doppler lifetime for room temperature vapor is about @xmath38 ns , while the beer s length is approximately @xmath2 cm .",
    "we assume that the laser pulses are linearly polarized with a bandwidth greater than the hyperfine splittings of the excited state , which is approximately @xmath39 mhz , but with bandwidth narrow enough to resolve the two hyperfine ground states which are split by approximately @xmath40 ghz .",
    "this implies the effective dipole moments , @xmath15 and @xmath41 , are equal which means that taking @xmath42 is quite accurate .",
    "our calculations use pulses with temporal duration around @xmath43 ns , which is consistent with all of our approximations and assumptions .",
    "the three - level mb model permits a useful parameterization in terms of bright and dark states @xcite , which help explain the interference effects caused by ground state coherence .",
    "we define the bright and dark states as : @xmath44 is the  total \" rabi frequency . in terms of the bright and dark states",
    "the hamiltonian in eq . can be written simply as : @xmath45 the interaction terms in @xmath46 clearly depend only on @xmath47 .",
    "the orthogonal dark state @xmath48 does not participate in the temporal dynamics so once population enters the dark state it becomes trapped , unless it evolves as a result of propagation . as clearly seen in the definition ,",
    "the bright and dark state basis is a fully coherent , pure - state superposition of the two ground states .",
    "this basis helps provide a clear understanding of phase - coherent effects on two - pulse propagation .    to more clearly understand these effects it is useful to convert the mb model into the bright - dark basis",
    "this was done by fleischhauer and manka @xcite , and we will follow their lead . we will take a pure - state approach in this particular section , to focus on purely phase - coherent effects . assuming a pure - state wavefunction of the form @xmath49 , the probability amplitude equations in the original atomic basis are :    [ mix - schrodinger ] @xmath50    where the dot refers to @xmath51 .",
    "one can recover the density matrix given in eqs . by taking @xmath52 . from eq .",
    "we can calculate the bright and dark probability amplitudes in terms of @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "they are :    [ bdprobamp ] @xmath55    for simplicity we will assume that the fields are unchirped and real , giving @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "this allows us to rewrite the eqs . as :    [ bdschrodinger ] @xmath58    where @xmath59 is called the the dark rabi frequency .",
    "we can write the corresponding maxwell s equations for the total and dark rabi frequencies as :    [ bdmaxwell ] @xmath60    where @xmath32 as previously noted .",
    "a surprising result occurs if the pulses are matched temporally , i.e. @xmath61 , which gives @xmath62 .",
    "this allows us to write eqs . and",
    "as :    [ bdtwolevel ] @xmath63    and @xmath64 we see that all dark - state effects disappear , and eqs . and are identical in form to the maxwell - bloch equations for a single  total \" pulse interacting with a two - level atom .",
    "thus if the dark state is initially unpopulated and the pulses are matched temporally , then the population is constrained to states @xmath47 and @xmath65 , and the three - level behavior is identical to that of a two - level atom .",
    "this explains the three - level simulton solutions derivation @xcite .",
    "however we will find that small fluctuations prohibit such isolation of the dark state over long propagation distances .",
    "kozlov and eberly ( ke ) also used this fact to examine sit - type vs. eit - type transparency @xcite . in sit",
    "it is nonlinearities that cause the medium to be transparent even while the dark state is unpopulated and strong interaction occurs between the pulse and the medium .",
    "thus sit propagation occurs when @xmath66 . as just shown , this implies that the three - level equations can be reduce to two - level form , and transparency only occurs if the two pulses are matched . in eit",
    "it is the presence of a second pulse and population trapping in the dark state that cancels absorption of the pulses by the medium .",
    "thus ke defined eit propagation to occur when @xmath67 . in this case , the medium is transparent because the combined pulse - medium system is in the dark state , cancelling pulse - medium interaction .",
