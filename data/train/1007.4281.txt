    "blaylock has argued that derivations of bell s inequality involve an implicit assumption of counterfactual definiteness as well as locality , and consequently the fact that quantum theory violates bell s inequality is consistent with the quantum world being local ( as well as realistic and deterministic).@xcite in response maudlin@xcite asserted that bell s result does not require counterfactual definiteness , and the fact that quantum theory violates it means that the quantum world is nonlocal : no local theory can reproduce the predictions of quantum mechanics for the results of experiments done very far apart .    in this article",
    "we shall show that this last assertion is mistaken , by exhibiting a local theory for the situation of interest : measurements of various components of spin angular momentum on two spin - half particles prepared in a singlet state .",
    "( blaylock considers polarization measurements on two photons , but these measurements amount to the same situation for the issues under discussion . )",
    "because maudlin s argument is clearly written and relatively short , it is possible to make a useful comparison between it and the sort of reasoning needed to yield consistent results in the quantum domain .",
    "the connection with counterfactual definiteness will also be discussed .",
    "the reader is probably aware that bell s inequality  see ref .   for extensive references",
    " puts constraints on certain correlation functions relating properties of separated systems , or measurements of these properties .",
    "quantum mechanics predicts violations of these constraints , and measurements confirm the predictions of quantum theory .",
    "consequently , any derivation of bell s inequality must violate one or more of the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics ; or to put it another way , when viewed from a quantum perspective such a derivation contains one or more mistakes . on this point blaylock ,",
    "maudlin , and the present author are in full agreement .",
    "the issue is : where and what are the mistakes ?",
    "finding mistakes is sometimes difficult .",
    "many of us have experienced the frustration of dealing with a student asking us to find the error in a lengthy argument which he thinks is valid , but which leads to a result that we know is wrong .",
    "various derivations of bell s inequality are complicated and involve probabilistic reasoning that is not straightforward .",
    "and sometimes additional assumptions , such as the existence of agents with free choice,@xcite move the discussion out of the realm of simple physics . understanding these arguments , much less finding mistakes in them",
    ", can be an arduous task .",
    "we are fortunate that the argument for nonlocality in ref .",
    "is clear , compact , well written , and free choice plays no essential role .    the present paper is not intended to discuss all the assumptions that underlie various derivations of bell s inequality , or their possible validity in domains unrelated to quantum theory . instead , the primary issue addressed is : at what point do bell s arguments , in particular as presented in ref .",
    ", conflict with quantum theory ?",
    "maudlin is not alone in maintaining that violations of bell s inequality imply that quantum mechanics is nonlocal . for an extended , though by no means complete , list of publications that have maintained this position , together with a significant number that have expressed disagreement ,",
    "see the bibliography in ref .  , which contains a more detailed analysis of the bell inequality from the perspective summarized in the present paper , along with a proof of an appropriate form of einstein locality .",
    "issues of the sort under discussion can not be resolved within the framework of standard quantum mechanics , when that is understood to be what is found in contemporary textbooks .",
    "although textbooks provide students with many effective and efficient techniques for doing calculations , they do not contain an adequate presentation of the fundamental principles of the theory needed to understand why these techniques lead to reasonable answers , and what are their limits of applicability .",
    "students become skilled at calculating the right answer , but are left confused or uncertain as to why , or whether , the answer really is right . inquiries from the perplexed",
    "are met with mermins@xcite well - known dictum : shut up and calculate ! in particular , attempts to make _ measurements _ part of the foundation of quantum mechanics are unsatisfactory because of the infamous _ measurement problem _ : the inability of such an approach to incorporate a physical measuring apparatus in fully quantum mechanical terms .",
    "the difficulties were pointed out by wigner,@xcite and remain unsolved.@xcite    thus in order to address the question of whether quantum theory is local , a consistent formulation of the principles that lie behind , and can be used to justify , the textbook calculations is needed ; a formulation that , as bell emphasized,@xcite is _ not _ based upon measurements , but instead allows us to understand , in quantum - mechanical terms , what goes on in real measuring processes .",
    "such a formulation , in which probabilities ( but not measurements ) are fundamental , exists , and deserves to be better known",
    ". we shall refer to it as the _ histories _ approach ; alternative names are _ _ consistent histories__@xcite and _ decoherent histories_. @xcite for further references and details see ref .",
    "; for short introductions see refs .   and .",
    "it yields what maudlin calls `` the predictions '' for bohm s version@xcite of the einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) problem.@xcite it is explicitly local , as discussed below , and was applied by the author to the epr problem in ref .  .",
    "because many readers will not be familiar with the histories approach ( it is not mentioned in refs .   and ) , some of its fundamental features are presented in a compact form in sec .",
    "[ sct2 ] , which deals with quantum statics , and in sec .",
    "[ sct3 ] , devoted to quantum dynamics .",
    "the histories approach is not based upon the concept of measurement , and readers who try to understand it in terms of measurements are likely to become confused .",
    "it is better to start with a mental picture of a classical system inside a closed box in which the dynamics is intrinsically random or stochastic .",
    "things actually happen inside the box , but what happens in the future ( or in the past ) can not be inferred with certainty from the state of affairs at a given point in time .",
    "as with any classical picture of the world , this one can only be a first step on the way to a fully consistent quantum description , but it is less likely to mislead than trying to think about things in terms of measurements associated with mysterious wave function collapses , as in current textbooks .",
    "section  [ sct4 ] discusses how genuine measurements , understood as real physical processes that go on in the real ( quantum ) world , can be understood from the perspective of fundamental quantum theory .",
    "the tools will then be in hand for a consistent analysis in sec .",
    "[ sct5 ] of the bohm version of the epr situation using two spin - half particles in a singlet state , both with and without measurements , demonstrating the locality of quantum theory .",
    "maudlin s argument for nonlocality@xcite is examined in sec .",
    "[ sbct6.1 ] in order to locate how and where it diverges from the analysis in sec .",
    "counterfactuals in the quantum domain are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sbct6.2 ] , with the conclusion that their misuse can plausibly be part of one route leading to bell s inequality , as blaylock indicates in ref .  , though perhaps it is not the only route .",
    "the paper ends with a brief summary and some comments in sec .",
    "the most fundamental difference between classical and quantum mechanics is that the former makes use of a phase space whose individual points represent possible states of a physical system , with subsets of points representing physical properties .",
    "whereas , as explained by von neumann @xcite , quantum mechanics uses a complex hilbert space , and physical properties correspond to subspaces , with a one - dimensional subspace ( ray ) the quantum analog of a single point in phase space .",
    "a finite - dimensional hilbert space is adequate for purposes of the following discussion . in classical mechanics",
    "the logical negation of the property @xmath0 that corresponds to a set of points @xmath1 in the phase space , which is to say the property `` not @xmath0 '' , is represented by the set - theoretic complement @xmath2 of the set @xmath1 . in the quantum case negation@xcite",
    "corresponds to the _ orthogonal complement _",
    "@xmath3 of the subspace @xmath1 : the collection of all vectors in the hilbert space that are orthogonal to every vector in the subspace .",
    "equivalently , if @xmath0 is the projector onto @xmath1 , its negation is represented by the projector @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the identity operator on the hilbert space .",
    "@xmath6    this leads to a profound difference between classical and quantum properties , which is best illustrated by considering a two - dimensional hilbert space representing possible properties of a spin - half particle , shown schematically in fig .  1 . ( the figure shows a real , rather than a complex hilbert space , but it is adequate for present purposes . )",
    "the line @xmath1 through the origin represents the physical property @xmath7 in units of @xmath8 .",
    "the line @xmath3 perpendicular to this line is its orthogonal complement and represents the physical property @xmath9 .",
    "the key point is that there are many other lines through the origin , such as @xmath10 corresponding ( schematically ) to the property @xmath11 , which are neither the same as the property @xmath7 or its negation , @xmath9 .",
    "this is fundamentally different from classical phase space where for a given property @xmath0 , any point in the phase space is either inside the set @xmath1 , which means the system this property @xmath0 , or in its complement @xmath2 , which means the system does not have property @xmath0 . in quantum mechanics",
    "we say that two properties @xmath0 and @xmath12 , such as @xmath7 and @xmath11 , are _ incompatible _ when the projectors onto the corresponding subspaces do not commute , @xmath13 . whenever noncommuting operators appear in quantum mechanics we have a situation that lacks a precise analog in classical physics .",
    "a consequence of adopting the von neumann approach to quantum properties , which underlies the presentations in all contemporary textbooks , is that quantum reasoning must follow different rules from classical reasoning . for a classical phase space",
    "the conjunction of two properties @xmath0 and @xmath12 , @xmath14 or `` @xmath0 and  @xmath12 , '' is always defined : it is the property corresponding to the intersection @xmath15 of the corresponding sets of points .",
    "but in the quantum case let @xmath0 be the property @xmath7 and @xmath12 be the incompatible property @xmath16 .",
    "can we make any sense of the conjunction `` @xmath0 and  @xmath12 '' ?",
    "does it correspond to any ray in the hilbert space ?",
    "the answer is that it does not , or at least there is no plausible way to make such an association .",
    "every ray in hilbert space can be interpreted as the property that @xmath17 for some direction in space @xmath18 , so there is nothing left over to represent a conjunction of the sort in which we are interested .",
    "there is no room for it in hilbert space . what shall we do ?",
    "von neumann was not unaware of this problem , and he and birkhoff made a proposal@xcite that if @xmath0 and @xmath12 refer to incompatible properties , `` @xmath0 and  @xmath12 '' should be the property corresponding to the _ intersection _ @xmath19 of the corresponding subspaces of hilbert space .",
    "as applied to the situation at hand , the intersection of the @xmath7 and @xmath16 rays is the subspace consisting of nothing but the zero vector , the origin in fig",
    "the orthogonal complement of the zero vector is the entire hilbert space , so the zero vector represents a proposition which is _ always false _ ; it is the counterpart of the empty set for a classical phase space .",
    "this is an interesting proposal ; let us pursue it for a bit and see where it leads , using a notation in which single letters @xmath20 and so forth correspond to projectors onto the rays @xmath7 , @xmath16 , and so forth .",
    "then the usual logical rules , with @xmath21 and @xmath22 meaning and  and or , lead to the expression @xmath23 where we have used the fact that @xmath24 is always true , because it is the negation of the always false property @xmath25 .",
    "but there is a serious problem with eq .  .",
    "the proposition or property on the left side is always false , as it is the disjunction of two always - false properties .",
    "so if we believe the equation , the property @xmath26 , the final term on the right , is always false .",
    "we could just as well have used @xmath27 in place of @xmath26 , and drawn the conclusion that @xmath27 is always false .",
    "hence @xmath28 is always false .",
    "but this contradicts the fact ",
    "see previous paragraph  that @xmath28 is always true ! we have arrived at a logical contradiction .",
    "how could two of the great mathematicians of the 20th century have made such a blunder ?",
    "the answer is that they did not .",
    "they were quite aware that this problem was going to arise , and that the ordinary rules of propositional logic would have to be modified .",
    "so they proposed discarding the distributive rule , which justifies the first equality in eq .",
    ", to produce what has come to be known as _",
    "quantum logic_.    does quantum logic provide a consistent underpinning of the calculational techniques found in quantum textbooks ? not likely .",
    "although quantum logic has been extensively studied as a subdiscipline of quantum foundations , so far as i am aware it has made no contribution to resolving the conceptual difficulties besetting quantum theory .",
    "it seems not to be used in quantum information theory , which is currently the `` cutting edge '' of developments in quantum theory , that is , in extending its concepts .",
    "this situation may simply reflect the fact that professional physicists are not smart enough to really understand quantum mechanics , and the problems of quantum foundations will have to remain unresolved until robots surpass our intelligence and can learn to think using the new rules .",
    "( but if they do come to understand quantum mechanics , will they be smart enough , or even sufficiently motivated , to explain it to _ us _ ? )    but surely the textbooks must do something with incompatible properties , and if birkhoff s and von neumann s reasoning has not been adopted , what takes its place ?",
    "one can discern two strategies .",
    "the first is based on measurements .",
    "there is no way to simultaneously _ measure _ @xmath29 and @xmath30 for a spin - half particle . on this",
    "everyone agrees , but we are back to the unsolved measurement problem .",
    "the second is to invoke the uncertainty principle .",
    "there are elegant mathematical formulations of various uncertainty principles to be found inside and outside textbooks .",
    "but what do they mean ?",
    "what it means in practice for the student learning the subject is that certain things are best not discussed , or if they are , the discussion should be accompanied by an appropriate amount of vagueness and arm waving . if one is discussing @xmath29 , then it is probably best to leave @xmath30 out of the discussion , though one is somewhat uncertain as to why certain things are uncertain .",
    "the histories approach uses a precise principle in place of arm waving .",
    "incompatible properties _ can not be combined _ in a meaningful quantum description of the world , even if the individual properties by themselves make perfectly good sense .",
    "the statement `` @xmath7 and  @xmath16 '' makes no sense .",
    "it is very important to keep in mind the distinction between `` makes no sense '' or `` meaningless , '' and `` always false . '' a statement that is meaningful and false  see our discussion of the birkhoff and von neumann approach  is one whose negation is meaningful and true . by contrast , the negation of a meaningless statement is equally meaningless . in ordinary logic",
    "the statement @xmath31 , which is to say `` @xmath0 and  or  @xmath12 , '' is meaningless , because it has not been formed according to the syntactical rules appropriate to the language .",
    "one should think of `` @xmath7 and@xmath16 '' as similar ",
    "it is meaningless in the sense that quantum mechanics can not assign it a meaning .",
    "similarly , `` @xmath7 or  @xmath16 '' is not a meaningful statement about quantum properties , so it makes no sense to ask , `` is the spin - half particle in the state @xmath11 or the state @xmath32 or possibly both ? ''",
    "students are taught that there is no way of measuring both @xmath30 and @xmath29 simultaneously , and this statement is correct .",
    "unfortunately , they are not taught that the reason such measurements are impossible is that there is nothing there to be measured : there is no physical property in the quantum world that such a measurement might reveal .",
    "it is not the limited ability of experimental physicists that is at issue ; in fact , one sign of a good experimental physicist is his inability to measure what is not there .    in the histories approach the rule for not combining incompatible properties is part of a more general single framework rule .",
    "a _ framework _ is a projective decomposition of the identity : a collection of projectors @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is a label not an exponent , which sum to the identity operator : @xmath35    each projector corresponds to a physical property .",
    "the significance of @xmath36 when @xmath37 is that these properties are mutually exclusive : if one is true the other is necessarily false .",
    "the collection of such properties form a _",
    "quantum sample space _ : not only are they mutually exclusive , but together they exhaust all possibilities  that is the significance of @xmath38 .",
    "the _ events _ , using the terminology of probability theory , associated with this sample space are projectors formed by taking sums of elements in the collection @xmath33 , including @xmath5 and the 0 projector ; together they comprise a boolean algebra under ( operator ) products and taking the complement @xmath4 of @xmath0 .",
    "two such frameworks are _ compatible _ if the projectors in the first commute with all the projectors in the second ; otherwise they are _ incompatible_. two compatible frameworks have a _ common refinement _ : a single framework whose boolean algebra includes all the projectors of both of the original frameworks .",
    "two incompatible frameworks have no common refinement .",
    "the _ single framework rule _ asserts that all reasoning about a quantum system must be carried out in a single framework in the sense that results from two frameworks _ can not be combined_. given two compatible frameworks the single framework rule is easily satisfied : carry out the reasoning using a common refinement .",
    "consequently , what the single framework rule prohibits is combining , or attempting to combine , results from incompatible frameworks .",
    "it is important to understand just what the single framework rule allows and what it prohibits .",
    "physicists are free to employ whatever framework they wish when describing a quantum system : formulas can be written down and probabilities calculated using the @xmath30 or @xmath39 , or the @xmath29 framework for a spin - half particle .",
    "call this freedom the principle of liberty .",
    "there is no law of nature , or of quantum theory , that says that one of these is the `` right '' framework ; from the perspective of fundamental quantum theory they are equally correct .",
    "call this the principle of equality . but liberty and equality are accompanied by a third principle : incompatibility .",
    "results in two incompatible frameworks can not be combined in a meaningful way",
    ". what these principles amount to in practice will become apparent when we consider various examples .",
    "note that when a physicist chooses to use a particular framework rather than some other to describe a quantum system , this is not at all a matter of somehow `` influencing '' the system in question . instead",
    ", such choices are somewhat like the choices a photographer makes in photographing mount rainier from , say , the north rather than from the south .",
    "such a choice determines what kind of information is present , and consequently the utility or the use which can be made of the resulting photograph .",
    "but it has no influence on the mountain itself . choosing a framework is thus very different from carrying out a measurement on a system , because a measurement can have a rather drastic effect upon a microscopic quantum system .",
    "von neumann@xcite taught us that quantum dynamics involves two distinct processes : a unitary or deterministic time evolution , and then a separate stochastic or probabilistic time evolution associated in some way with measurements .",
    "although this is what students learn in textbooks , both students and teachers ( and , one suspects , textbook writers  see ref .  )",
    "find it unaesthetic .",
    "one can sympathize with the efforts of everett and his successors@xcite to reduce all of quantum dynamics to a unitary form ( for a closed system ) , even though the `` many worlds '' ( or `` many minds '' ) approach has its own share of obscurities and difficulties.@xcite blaylock@xcite is in favor of the many - worlds interpretation , and maudlin@xcite is not .",
    "the histories approach used in this paper is the exact opposite of everett s in the sense that quantum time evolution is _ always _ stochastic , or more precisely , should always be put in a stochastic or probabilistic framework .",
    "classical ( hamiltonian ) dynamics is deterministic : there is a unique map carrying each point in the phase space at a give time to another specific point at any particular later ( or earlier ) time .",
    "but there is no reason why the quantum world should necessarily possess the same sort of deterministic time development .",
    "and there is good experimental support , as in the random time of decay of unstable particles , for the idea that quantum dynamics has an intrinsically probabilistic character .",
    "but what about _ the wave function _ that satisfies the schrdinger s ( time - dependent and deterministic ) equation ?",
    "_ solutions to schrdinger s equation are to be used for calculating probabilities .",
    "_ this is what born@xcite taught us and what is done in textbooks . formulating probabilistic ideas using histories , as in ref .  , chap",
    ".  8 , results in a consistent approach that removes ( or at least `` tames '' ) quantum paradoxes .",
    "a consistent discussion of a stochastic process , whether classical or quantum , begins by introducing a sample space of mutually exclusive possibilities , which we shall refer to as _ histories_. these can be represented , just as quantum properties at a single time , by subspaces on a _ history _",
    "hilbert space consisting of a tensor product of copies of the hilbert space describing a quantum system at a single time , and with the projectors on the history space playing a role analogous to those corresponding to properties at a single time .",
    "( for details , see ref .  , chap",
    "once again , there are many possibilities for such sample spaces , and the single framework rule says that the physicist is welcome to use any one he pleases ( liberty and equality ) , as long as he does not put together meaningless combinations of incompatible sample spaces ( incompatibility ) .",
    "the simplest sorts of histories consist of just a sequence of quantum properties at a succession of different times , and the set of properties considered at one time may be incompatible with the set considered at a different time .",
    "thus there is nothing inherently wrong with saying that at successive times @xmath40 a spin - half particle has @xmath7 and then @xmath41 , and then @xmath42 , or perhaps @xmath43 at the third time .",
    "these properties need not , and generally do not , map into one another under the unitary time evolution of a closed system generated by schrdinger s equation .    for this paper it will suffice to consider histories for a sequence of times @xmath44 which can be represented in the form @xmath45 where @xmath46 projects onto the initial state @xmath47 at @xmath48 , so all histories begin with this initial state , and @xmath49 denotes a ( projective ) decomposition of the identity @xmath5 at time @xmath50 , see eq .  .",
    "the time is labeled by a subscript , and decompositions at different times need have no relation with one another .",
    "the superscript on the history @xmath51 denotes a string of labels : @xmath52 the @xmath53 symbols in eq .",
    "can be interpreted as variants of the usual @xmath54 symbol denoting a tensor product , but for present purposes we can think of them as simply separating possible events at one time from events at the next time .",
    "probabilities can be assigned to histories if such a family represents events in a closed quantum system , in the following way .",
    "let @xmath55 be the unitary _ time development _",
    "operator ; for example , if the system hamiltonian @xmath56 is independent of time , then @xmath57 $ ] . for",
    "history @xmath58 define the corresponding _ chain ket _ : @xmath59 then provided the _ consistency condition _",
    "@xmath60 is satisfied , the probability of history @xmath58 is given by @xmath61 assuming that @xmath47 in eq .",
    "is a normalized state . here",
    "@xmath62 means that for at least one @xmath63 it is the case that @xmath64 .    for a history family involving a large number of times eq .   is a fairly stringent constraint .",
    "however , for families that involve only two times , thus one time @xmath65 following the initial time @xmath48 , it is always satisfied because of the assumed orthogonality of the projectors at time @xmath65 . in this case",
    "@xmath66 is simply the usual born rule , so eq .   represents a generalization of the born rule to histories involving three or more times , for which one has to pay attention to eq .  .",
    "note that the probability assignment in eq .  , of which eq .",
    "is a special case , _ makes no reference to measurements _ , and in this sense is distinct from what is found in textbooks .",
    "however , by using it as a fundamental axiom one can , as for example in sec .",
    "[ sct4 ] , justify all the usual textbook calculations .",
    "what is usually found in textbooks is not eq .",
    "but the equivalent expression @xmath67 where the second equality applies when @xmath68 is a rank one projector onto the pure state @xmath69 . here",
    "@xmath70 is obtained by integrating schrdinger s equation starting with @xmath47 , and is often referred to as _ the _ wave function .",
    "however , this @xmath71 is best viewed as a calculational tool , rather than , as in everett s interpretation , the actual state of the universe , or that part of the universe that constitutes the closed quantum system under discussion .",
    "there are two ways to see this .",
    "one is that in general the corresponding projector @xmath72 does not commute with the projector @xmath68 , which in the family of histories eq .",
    "represents a particular physical property at time @xmath65 .",
    "as one can not in the histories approach ascribe two incompatible properties to a single quantum system at the same instant of time , @xmath71 can not represent a physical property when we use the family eq .  .    the second way to see that @xmath73 in eq .",
    "is nothing but a calculational tool is to calculate the same probability by another method which makes no mention of it : @xmath74 is again obtained by integrating schrdinger s equation ( in the opposite time direction ) to obtain the @xmath75 used in eq .  .",
    "because the same probability can be obtained using either @xmath73 or @xmath75 , they can be regarded as alternative calculational tools , or _",
    "pre - probabilities _ in the notation of ref .  , sec .",
    "a pre - probability is used to calculate probabilities of physical properties , and is thus if anything less real than the probabilities assigned to real properties .",
    "hence `` the '' wave function plays a very secondary role in the histories approach , quite different from everett or many worlds .    to be sure ,",
    "there are special _ unitary _ families of histories in which `` the '' wave function is closely associated with physical properties ; an example is given below . before discussing it ,",
    "let us note that just as there are incompatible quantum properties , there are also incompatible histories , and the latter must be treated in much the same way as the former . a collection of histories associated with a suitable sample space , for example , the @xmath76 defined in eq .",
    ", is referred to as a _ framework _ or _ _ consistent family _ _ of histories _ provided _ the consistency conditions , eq .  , for the family under consideration , are satisfied .",
    "two such families may be either compatible or incompatible .",
    "they are compatible if there is a common refinement , a family of more detailed histories which includes both families we started with , and also satisfies the consistency conditions .",
    "otherwise they are incompatible , and the single framework rule says they are not to be combined , or the combination is meaningless ( quantum theory can assign it no meaning ) .",
    "once again , the pillars of good quantum reasoning are liberty , equality , and incompatibility ; see the discussion at the end of sec .",
    "in particular , equality means that from the point of view of fundamental quantum mechanics there is no reason to prefer one consistent family to another , there is no law of nature that singles out `` the right family . ''",
    "how this works can be illustrated by the case of schrdinger s poor cat whose sorry history is no doubt familiar to the reader . under unitary time evolution",
    "the cat ends up in a state which can be described as a superposition of dead and alive , which schrdinger and his successors found perplexing .",
    "so how does the histories approach deal with it ?",
    "first , there must be a choice of a framework , which is to say a series of possibilities at the different times of interest .",
    "let the initial state @xmath47 include the cat , the apparatus , and whatever else is needed to treat this as a closed quantum system .",
    "one possible family of histories is that in which at each time @xmath50 , @xmath77 is a projector onto the subspace containing `` the '' wave function as defined by eq .  ; @xmath78 is its negation .",
    "this family is unitary in the notation in ref .",
    "8.7 ; it is consistent , and the physicist who wants to use it is at liberty to do so . but the historian will remind him that referring to `` schrdinger cat '' states at later times constitutes something of a misnomer because the corresponding projector @xmath79 will ( at least in general ) not commute with projectors for physical properties of anything one would want to call a cat . if the physicist  says the historian  wants to discuss what is happening to something that can properly be called a cat , then it is necessary to adopt a different framework , one containing projectors referring to states in which the cat is dead or alive as mutually exclusive possibilities .",
    "such frameworks exist , are just as fundamental ( equality ) as the unitary framework , and of much greater utility to the physicist interested in biology or some other aspect of the ordinary macroscopic world .",
    "one of the unfortunate features of contemporary quantum mechanics textbooks is their inability to make much sense of experiments of the sort that are done all the time in the laboratory by competent experimental physicists .",
    "such measurements are typically designed to reveal properties possessed by systems _ before _",
    "the measurement takes place .",
    "what does this electrical pulse mean ?",
    "it means that the proton knocked out of the target by the high energy electron has ionized the gas near a pair of wires in the detector  . by the time they give talks reporting their results experimental physicists seem to have forgotten ( fortunately ) what they learned from textbooks about measurements magically producing reality out of nothing .",
    "when the quantum analysis is done properly using histories , one finds that the experimentalists are correct .",
    "once one allows them liberty their discussions make perfectly good sense .",

    "the problem is that the very possibility of alternative descriptions , the principles of liberty and equality , are absent from textbook treatments .    to summarize , in order to discuss measurements _ as measurements _ in the typical sense in which experimental physicists think of them , it is necessary to introduce frameworks or families in which _ both _ the measurement outcome _ and _ the relevant properties of the system before the measurement takes place are made part of a consistent family .",
    "textbooks in effect adopt a framework in which outcomes make sense , because otherwise their discussions would never get off the ground : simple use of unitary time development leads to macroscopic quantum superpositions and the measurement problem .",

    "m2 : :    assume locality : a measurement carried out on particle @xmath111    can not affect the physical state of particle @xmath112 .",
    "m3 : :    this means that particle @xmath112 must already have been    disposed to yield the opposite result even before particle    @xmath111 was measured .",
    "m4 : :    particle @xmath112 must have been so disposed even when the    total quantum mechanical state of the system was the singlet state    @xmath120 , and at all times since its creation .",
    "m5 : :    therefore the complete physical description of particle    @xmath112 must determine how it is disposed to yield a    particular outcome for each possible spin measurement , because m1    holds for any spin component .",
    "m6 : :    hence a local theory must not only be deterministic but also a hidden    variable theory ( in the sense of m5 ) .",
    "m7 : :    any local theory that predicts the epr correlations must also respect    certain constraints on the correlations it predicts ( bell s    inequality ) .",
    "m8 : :    quantum mechanics violates these constraints and thus the locality    assumption in m2 .",
    "let us compare these assertions with the analysis in sec .",
    "evidently m1 corresponds to the anticorrelation expressed in eq .   in terms of the particles themselves , or in eq .   for measurement outcomes , assuming @xmath183 , that is , measurements of the same spin component .",
    "note that although these formulas were obtained for @xmath115 and @xmath117 , the results are equally valid if @xmath138 is replaced , for both particles , with an arbitrary direction @xmath18 . as for m2 , dynamical locality",

    "furthermore , direct calculation , see eq .   and",
    "the comments following it , shows that the spin of particle @xmath112 is unaffected by making a measurement on particle @xmath111 . and m3 , the disposition of the @xmath112 particle to yield the opposite result even before the @xmath111 particle was measured , is evident from the fact that eqs .   or hold for all applicable values of @xmath50 and @xmath186 : @xmath65 and @xmath83 before the measurement of particle @xmath111 and @xmath159 after the measurement .",

    "[ sct2 ] , there is no meaningful way to ascribe a value to any component of the spin angular momentum of particle @xmath112 at this time , because the two projectors do not commute . ignoring this is to ignore a crucial difference , one might say the crucial difference , between the quantum and the classical world : quantum incompatibility .",
    "one way out of the difficulty is to consider @xmath120 a pre - probability rather than a property ; see the discussion following eq .  , and in ref .",
    ", sec .  9.4 .",
    "but it is not clear that a reference to @xmath120 is really essential for the later stages of maudlin s argument , so perhaps we can replace m4 by a modified form consistent with the framework eq .  :",

    "however , at m5 we arrive at a significant divergence from the principle of hilbert space quantum mechanics that states that any physical description of a particle at a single time must correspond to some subspace of its hilbert space .",
    "neither @xmath120 nor any subspace of @xmath188 for particle @xmath112 can be interpreted as indicating how particle @xmath112 is disposed to yield a _ particular _",

    "this is in contrast to a `` classical '' spinning object , such as a golf ball , where one can easily imagine a spin state which can be used to predict , at least with very high precision , the outcome of a measurement of any component of its spin angular momentum . and",
    "there is no obvious way of rewording m5 to evade this difficulty .    what has led to this problem ?",

    "it is therefore natural to assume , and it would be true in a classical world , that @xmath189 is _ simultaneously _ true for _ every _ @xmath18 .",
    "but different @xmath18 lead to different , incompatible frameworks , and therefore this last conclusion violates the single framework rule of consistent quantum reasoning .",
    "nothing similar ever arises in pre - quantum physics , so it is easy to make this kind of mistake by employing classical reasoning in a domain where it does not work , namely , hilbert - space quantum mechanics .",
    "the foregoing analysis indicates what seems to be the critical misstep in the presentation of bell s argument in ref .  :",
    "classical reasoning applied to the description of microscopic quantum particles in a way that violates the principles of hilbert space quantum mechanics , as expressed by the single framework rule .",
    "as noted in sec .  [ sct2 ] , birkhoff and von neumann were aware that hilbert space quantum mechanics is incompatible with classical modes of reasoning .",
    "ignoring this insight does not make the problem go away , and numerous quantum paradoxes , along with the claim that the quantum world is pervaded with nonlocal influences that violate relativity theory , can be seen to have their roots in a failure to deal seriously with the logical problem posed by a hilbert space description . but",
    "the connection of all this with counterfactual arguments deserves some additional discussion .",
    "blaylock@xcite claims that a key component in bell s inequality , or at least an argument leading to it , is counterfactual definiteness : the assumption that a measurement that was not performed had a single definite result .",
    "he concludes that therefore the violation of bell s inequality by quantum mechanics does not by itself imply nonlocality .",
    "does our analysis throw some light on this matter ?",
    "it is helpful to explore the issue of counterfactuals in quantum mechanics starting with a simpler example than the one considered in sec .",
    "[ sct5 ] , namely a measurement of a component of spin angular momentum in a situation in which the apparatus can be adjusted to measure either @xmath29 or @xmath30 .",
    "for example , for a particle traveling along the @xmath140 axis one could imagine rotating the stern - gerlach magnet so that the field gradient is parallel to @xmath138 or to @xmath139 .",
    "naturally , only one component can be measured in a given run ; suppose that in a particular case it was @xmath29 .",
    "then the following counterfactual question seems sensible : what _ would have _ been the result _ if _ the apparatus had been set up to measure @xmath30 instead ? and we can ask : is the answer to this question different for the ( real ) quantum world than it would be for a ( hypothetical ) classical world ? it is possible to set up a model in which the measurement axis is determined by the outcome of `` flipping a quantum coin , '' and address the situation inside the total closed system ( coin plus apparatus plus particle being measured ) using the appropriate quantum analysis to calculate the probabilities for a single consistent family ; see ref .  ,",
    "there is no problem finding a decomposition of the identity which includes the apparatus pointer positions for both outcomes of the quantum coin flip . but",
    "to describe this as an authentic measurement in which the pointer position is correlated with a state before the measurement we need to include the corresponding particle property at a time before the measurement took place . in the case of the @xmath29 measurement",
    "the corresponding particle projectors will be @xmath26 and @xmath27 , whereas for the counterfactual @xmath30 measurements we would like to use @xmath190 and @xmath191 .",
    "however , the @xmath138 projectors do not commute with the @xmath139 projectors , so they can not both be placed in the same consistent family .",
    "note that the issue raised here has no direct connection with locality ; we are considering only a single measurement on a single particle at a single location .",
    "valid counterfactual reasoning in the quantum domain ought to follow the same standards as ordinary reasoning , which is to say it must be restricted to a single consistent family .",
    "thus the incompatibility at the microscopic level discussed in the previous paragraph can render a quantum counterfactual argument invalid even if the corresponding classical argument is correct , or at least plausible .",
    "there is never a problem if we limit the discussion to measurement outcomes and exclude all talk , even implicit , of particle properties preceding the measurement .",
    "however , bell inequality derivations always make some assumption about what goes on in the world prior to the measurements themselves , and maudlin s argument for nonlocality is filled with references to particle properties , so in either case counterfactual parts of the argument , if present , could well be in conflict with quantum theory . even in the classical domain , counterfactual arguments can make an implicit reference to a preceding state of affairs , which may make it difficult to analyze their structure ; see ref .",
    "so is is plausible that something like that will also be present when these arguments are applied to quantum situations .",
    "in fact it is possible to arrive at maudlin s m5 , which as we pointed is in conflict with quantum theory as consistently interpreted using histories , by employing the following counterfactual argument :    we know that if @xmath29 is measured for particle @xmath111 and the outcome is @xmath130 , then @xmath117 was @xmath118 even before a measurement which confirmed that it had this value . if on the other hand @xmath192 , with @xmath18 some other direction in space , had been measured with , say , the outcome @xmath116 , then by the same line of reasoning @xmath145 would have had the value @xmath118 , which would have been confirmed by a later measurement had it measured @xmath145 .",
    "so the @xmath112 particle must have had a definite value of @xmath145 for every possible @xmath18 before any measurement took place , namely , the opposite of the outcome of the @xmath192 measurement which did not but could have taken place .",
    "this argument is of the counterfactual type because it starts with the assumption that @xmath115 was measured in the actual world and @xmath192 in the imaginary or counterfactual world . in it",
    "one sees a connection with what blaylock considers suspicious about derivations of bell s inequality : counterfactual definiteness , the assumption that unperformed measurements have definite outcomes .",
    "the historian will point to a failure to follow the single framework rule as the most likely error on the route from seemingly reasonable assumptions to a conclusion that is obviously wrong , at least if hilbert space quantum mechanics is accepted as the physicist s fundamental description of the world ; see the discussion of m5 in sec .",

    "it seems plausible that flawed ( from the quantum perspective ) counterfactual reasoning provides at least one possible route for deriving bell s inequality , with its conclusions inapplicable to the real ( quantum ) world , and in this respect the analysis given in this paper supports blaylock s conclusions . for more on the subject of the correct use of counterfactuals in the quantum domain ,",
    "see ref .  , chap .  19 .",
    "what we have shown by means of a counterexample is that quantum violations of bell s inequality are perfectly consistent with quantum mechanics being a local theory , in the sense that measurements near one point in space do not immediately affect what goes on elsewhere .",
    "so the claim by maudlin@xcite that no local theory can reproduce the predictions of quantum mechanics is incorrect , at least for the situation under discussion : two spin - half particles initially in a singlet state .",
    "much more can be said about quantum locality , and ref .   gives a more extensive treatment of the topic using the histories formulation in a consistent manner to sort out the issues .",
    "there the suggestion is made that bell s inequality is best thought of as being appropriate to the domain of classical physics but not quantum physics : it has a perfectly good derivation , at least for all practical purposes , in the case of golf balls , and one can see explicitly how this derivation breaks down as the total angular momentum quantum number decreases from around @xmath193 to @xmath194 .",
    "thus there is nothing wrong with maudlin s reasoning , except that it is does not apply to the quantum world . here",
    "new rules of reasoning are needed , as birkhoff and von neumann@xcite realized , even though their particular proposal has not turned out to be a fruitful approach for understanding quantum mechanics .",
    "the extent to which counterfactual reasoning of a sort inconsistent with quantum principles is a necessary part of derivations of bell s inequality is less clear , though this is certainly one route for getting there , as blaylock@xcite pointed out . in particular",
    ", it is plausible that maudlin s version of the bell argument makes use of some form of counterfactual reasoning , and in this sense the present article supports the conclusion of blaylock that counterfactual reasoning , rather than an assumption of locality , is why derivations of bell s inequality lead to conclusions inconsistent with quantum theory and experiment .",
    "an important lesson to be drawn from all of this is the need for a clear presentation of consistent principles of quantum reasoning in textbooks and courses .",
    "when teaching courses on quantum information i always stress the fact that there are no nonlocal influences in quantum theory , and point out that this principle is useful to keep in mind when analyzing quantum circuits . unfortunately , physics students trained in traditional quantum courses have difficulty replacing , or at least augmenting , the calculational rules they learned by rote with a consistent probabilistic analysis of what is going on .",
    "they may already have learned that the superluminal influences reflected in violations of bell s inequality can not be used to transmit information .",
    "but they also need to hear a simple explanation for why this is so : such influences do not exist .",
    "they are nothing but fudge factors needed to correct a mistaken use of classical reasoning in the quantum domain .",
