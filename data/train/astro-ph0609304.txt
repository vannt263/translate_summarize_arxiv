    "this young stellar cluster and its surrounding gaseous environment are relatively poorly studied ; only a handful of stellar members have been identified and characterized , and the molecular cloud has not been well - mapped . in optical and near - infrared images ,",
    "the exciting cluster is not prominent against the galactic field population except for a few bright members ( figure [ fig : dss2mass ] ) . yet , two of these stars are remarkably luminous and massive with spectral types o3 if ( m@xmath10 m@xmath11 ) and o3 iii ( m@xmath12 m@xmath11 ; * ? ? ?",

    "this would be highly unusual , as top - heavy imfs are seen only in extreme starburst environments such as the super - star clusters of m 82 @xcite .",
    "we investigate this question by measuring , for the first time , the low - mass pre - main sequence ( pre - ms ) population of the pismis 24 cluster and its environs .",

    "_ chandra _ observations can penetrate heavy absorption up to @xmath13 @xcite and resolve point sources with sub - arcsecond resolution . in most cases ,",
    "the x - ray detected stars appear on existing near - infrared ( nir ) images ; the advantage is that the strong x - ray emission of pre - ms stars ( elevated @xmath14 above ms stars * ? ? ?",

    "we estimate that the cluster has @xmath15 stars , @xmath16 times richer than the known orion nebula cluster .",
    "the presence of two o3 stars is compatible with a cluster of this population .",

    "data reduction starts with filtering the level 1 event list processed by the _",
    "chandra _ x - ray center pipeline to recover an improved level 2 event list . to improve absolute astrometry ,",
    "x - ray positions of acis - i sources were obtained by running the _ wavdetect _ wavelet - based source detection algorithm @xcite within the _ chandra _ interactive analysis of observations ( ciao ) package on the original level 2 event list , using only the central @xmath42 of the field .",
    "the resulting x - ray sources were matched to the 2mass point source catalog .",

    "was corrected using the penn state cti corrector ( version 1.16 ) developed by @xcite .",
    "a multifaceted source finding procedure is summarized here , which is designed to locate all potential sources , even in the presence of crowding or a broad psf , with the recognition that features due to detector noise may also enter the source list .",
    "first , we assemble a large number of candidate sources using a variety of techniques and criteria ( wavdetect , reconstruction , visual selection , etc .",
    ", as described below ) , which includes a number of possible false detections .",
    "these spurious sources are identified and removed after the photon extraction step (  3.3 ) , where our customized tool evaluates the statistical significance of each detection above background , rejecting likely false detections when significances fail to meet a chosen threshold .",
    "these photons are then returned to the background and we re - evaluate the source significance for the surviving candidates , finally defining reliable detections and marginal detections for inclusion in tables of source properties .",
    "the details of this procedure are described below .",
    "source detection was carried out with the improved level 2 event list that is band - limited to 0.57.0 kev with cosmic ray afterglows removed .",
    "effective exposure maps and images for the full field , the @xmath45 i array , the central @xmath46 of the i array , and the inner @xmath47 of the field were made with 4-pixel , 2.6-pixel , 1-pixel , and half - pixel binning , respectively ( an acis sky pixel is @xmath48 on a side ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : acis_i]a shows the raw acis i - array image at reduced resolution .",
    "adaptive - kernel smoothed flux images were created with the ciao tool _ csmooth _ @xcite to help identify additional potential faint sources and any possible diffuse emission .",
    "the resulting full field two - color smoothed image and a zoom - in on the cluster core are shown in figure  [ fig : acis_i ] ; red and blue represent the soft band emission ( 0.52.0 kev ) and hard band emission ( 2.07.0 kev ) , respectively .",
    "the _ wavdetect _ program was run with source significance threshold @xmath49 on each of the four binned images described above , in three energy bands ( 0.52.0 kev , 2.07.0 kev , and 0.57.0 kev ) .",
    "this source significance threshold may give some false detections , but experience has shown us that this threshold is appropriate for crowded fields that might contain complex backgrounds due to diffuse emission . merging",
    "the detections from the 12 runs resulted in a list of 614 potential point sources on acis - i .",
    "careful visual inspection revealed that _ wavdetect _ still missed several apparent sources in the central region of the cluster . to take advantage of the sub - arcsecond psf at positions around the aimpoint",
    ", we applied a subpixel positioning code @xcite to improve spatial resolution in the inner part of the field and performed an image reconstruction with the lucy - richardson maximum likelihood algorithm @xcite .",
    "our image reconstruction technique for crowded stellar clusters is described in detail in @xcite and a similar procedure is followed here .",
    "the maximum likelihood image reconstruction code was run in the crowded central region using a @xmath50 image made with 0.2-pixel binning and centered on pis 24 - 1 , using the 1.0 kev psf at that on - axis location from the psf library in the _ ciao _ calibration database .",
    "we chose the 200th iteration of the algorithm as the most appropriate image for source searching , as it showed good psf removal without over - resolving the data .",
    "we adopted the _ find _ procedure in the _ daophot _ package @xcite to obtain the centroid , shape , and brightness parameters of the resolved peaks .",
    "several combinations of flux ( @xmath51 ) , roundness ( @xmath52 ) , and sharpness ( @xmath53 ) limits were tested to minimize the number of peaks from one photon , and the adopted parameters to reject spurious peaks were : @xmath54 or @xmath55 ; or @xmath56 ; or @xmath57 and @xmath58 . using saoimage ds9 @xcite , world coordinate system ( wcs ) region files were made , centered on the unrejected peaks , based on 90@xmath59 psf contours .",
    "the final reconstructed source list was made with the aid of the i - array image overlaid with these regions where any remaining reconstructed peaks that contain only single photon events within 90@xmath59 psf contours were rejected .",
    "this image reconstruction procedure was performed separately using another image centered on pis 24 - 17 because _ chandra _ s psf varies at different locations and an appropriate local psf must be used for the reconstruction .",
    "examples of valid sources from image reconstruction are shown in figure  [ fig : recon ] .",
    "the list of potential sources from the maximum likelihood reconstruction was merged with the _ wavdetect _ source catalog . by overlaying regions representing the potential sources onto the original and smoothed acis - i images ,",
    "an additional 40 sources were added based on spatial concentrations of @xmath60 photons and proximity of 2mass near - ir sources ( @xmath61 ) . the source finding procedure described here results in a total of 910 potential sources identified on the acis - i array .",
    "a preliminary event extraction for the 910 potential x - ray sources was made with _",
    "acis extract _ ( version 3.79 ; hereafter _ ae _ ) , a versatile script written in idl that performs source extraction , fits x - ray spectra , creates light curves , and computes a wide variety of statistical properties of the sources @xcite . using the _ ae_-calculated probability @xmath62 that the extracted events are solely due to poisson fluctuations in the local background ,",
    "source validity can be statistically evaluated while taking account of the large distorted psf at far off - axis locations and spatial variations in the background .",
    "the traditional source significance , defined as the photometric signal to noise ratio , is calculated for every source as well .",
    "we rejected sources with @xmath63 likelihood of being a background fluctuation .",
    "the trimmed source list includes 779 sources , with full - band ( 0.58.0 kev ) net ( background - subtracted ) counts ranging from 1.7 to 1837 counts .",
    "we performed source extraction with this list using _ ae _ as described in detail by @xcite .",
    "the 779 valid sources are purposely divided into two lists : the 665 sources with @xmath64 make up our primary source list of highly reliable sources ( table  [ tbl : primary ] ) , and the remaining 114 sources with @xmath65 likelihood of being spurious background fluctuations values are greater than 0.01 , our rejection threshold in the preliminary run .",
    "this is due to the feedback to the background from the rejected sources when we re - extract the trimmed source list .",
    "as described in detail in  2.1 of @xcite , our catalog cutting scheme is iterative : the initial set of 910 potential sources is extracted and then cut at the threshold of 1% .",
    "the rejected sources are allowed to contribute to the background and the trimmed list of 779 valid sources is then re - extracted , resulting in different local background estimates and different source validity metrics @xmath62 .",
    "thus , some @xmath62 values in table 2 are @xmath66% . ] are listed as tentative sources in table  [ tbl : tentative ] .",
    "we believe that most of those tentative sources are likely real detections of the field and are likely low - mass cluster members . ] .",
    "we should note that the separation of reliable sources , tentative sources , and invalid sources is based on a single simple statistic , the poisson probability of observing the extracted counts given the local background density .",
    "this permits scientists to evaluate the reliability of each source individually .",
    "a high cutoff ( around 4 counts for a typical _ chandra _ exposure on - axis ) reduces spurious noise - based sources ( _ false positives _ ) but misses some real sources ( _ false negatives _ ) .",
    "a low cutoff reduces the false negatives while increasing the false positives . in the absence of a consensus statistical procedure for the poisson weak - signal - in - background problem",
    ", there is no way to clean the list in an objective fashion without losing real sources .",
    "since different scientists make different decisions on the balance between false positives and false negatives , and there are good scientific reasons to believe many astronomically interesting faint sources lie in _ chandra _ images of rich stellar clusters , we have opted to report marginal sources in table  2 .",
    "the reader is clearly warned that the reality of some of these weakest sources is suspect , and each source s @xmath62 can be examined individually .",
    "these choices concerning how we choose to report faint sources do not affect our science results .",
    "the weakest x - ray sources are only used for x - ray luminosity function estimation (  5.1 ) , contributing to the faintest two bins of the xlf , which do not impact on our conclusions regarding the ngc 6357 stellar population .",
    "we further note that _ every _ detection scheme must  explicitly or implicitly  estimate the local background , and every such estimate must implicitly identify the data that are guessed not to be background .",
    "for crowded young stellar clusters , this can never be accomplished in a unique , objective manner as it depends on the unknown distribution of true faint sources ( including thousands of stars which lie below any detection threshold ) and possibly diffuse emission from o star winds @xcite .",

    "the number of x - ray stars in the central region is 333 while the extended region contains 446 stars .",
    "because these stars are poorly studied , we can only speculate that the stars in the central region represent the coeval dense cluster core of pismis 24 , while the apparent extended wing is a mixture of evaporating cluster members and newly formed stars distributed throughout the molecular cloud enveloping the cluster .",

    "the stellar density of the onc core appears to be @xmath05 times higher than the x - ray population in the pismis 24 cluster core , but this can be largely attributed to the differencein the number of faint stars detected : the onc sample from the 800  ksec coup observation extends into the brown dwarf regime , while the pismis 24 sample becomes incomplete around @xmath213 (  5.1 ) . extrapolating to brown dwarf masses using the coup mass distribution ( getman et al .",

    "these unidentified sources very likely are real low - mass members concentrated around the massive stars .",
    "a puzzling feature arises when we compare the core of the massive cluster centered on the two o3 stars to the large ring - like nebula with a large cavity that makes up the wider view of ngc 6357 ( figure  1 ) : the cluster is significantly off - center to the north . the `` diamond ring '' morphology of ngc 6357 is apparent in the h@xmath216 and mid - ir images , with the bright point along the edge brightened torus .",
    "in contrast , the rosette nebula has a similar annular nebula morphology , but the massive ob stars in ngc 2244 exciting the nebula are located right in the center .",
    "the hollow hii morphology is attributed to strong ob stellar winds excavating molecular materials and the depletion of gas by newly formed stars @xcite .",
    "therefore the nebular shape is generally accepted as spherical or cylindrical . in ngc 6357 ,",
    "the most massive members are so close to the northern edge of the nebula that it seems implausible that the cavity is created by the strong winds of the current generation of hot stars . in general , supernovae explosions and strong stellar winds",
    "can shape the natal cloud by creating wind - blown `` bubbles''cavities .",
    "however , there is no evidence for a recent supernova : neither diffuse x - ray emission from a hot tenuous plasma nor non - thermal radio emission is detected in this region .",
    "we further note that the presence of wr 93 , an evolved star , is circumstantial evidence that some population of massive stars in ngc 6357 is old enough to produce supernovae .",
    "it is possible that a previous - generation of hot stars created the large cavity and formation of the current ionizing population was triggered at the densest edge of the excavated cavity .",
    "combined with different viewing angles , this can result in diverse morphologies such as an egg , or a diamond ring , rather than a symmetrical annulus .",
    "h@xmath216 images of quite a number of regions where the stars are displaced with respect to the center of an evacuated cavity have been shown in the large magellanic cloud @xcite and modeled as modified strmgren spheres @xcite .",

    "onir photometric and spectroscopy study of the @xmath030 stars in this subcluster , permitting their placement on the hr diagram , might reveal whether they are older than the main cluster concentrated off the center of the nebula .",
    "an alternative scenario is that the cavity is indeed created by the massive pis 24 stars that are emitting ionizing photons . in that case , the displacement from the center could be explained with spatial projection and an inhomogeneous molecular cloud , as first proposed by @xcite .",
    "the o stars were close to the geometrical center of the pismis 24 cluster and created an expanding hii bubble , which may have encountered a much denser interstellar medium in the northern part than in other directions",

    "this is fully consistent with the absorption - corrected soft diffuse x - ray luminosity @xmath274 ergs s@xmath2 .",
    "therefore we suggest that most of the diffuse emission is probably the combined contribution from individually undetected x - ray - faint pre - ms cluster members .",
    "we further note that x - ray emission is clearly present on the acis - s chips .",
    "several point sources are detected , with very large psfs due to large off - axis angles .",
    "the x - ray emission captured at the lower edge of the s - array field corresponds to the location of the hii  region g353.2 + 0.7 ( see figure  2b and figure  [ fig : dss2mass]f ) .",
    "but due to the poor psf , no further conclusion can be drawn on whether the emission is diffuse in nature .",
    "nevertheless , this detection confirms the rosat detection of g353.2 + 0.7 and implies that it contains lots of x - ray - emitting young stars .",
    "this 38 ks acis observation of the ngc 6357 field has provided the first high spatial resolution x - ray image of this massive star - forming complex .",
    "we summarize the main results of our study as follows :    \\1 .",
    "we detect 779 x - ray sources with a limiting x - ray sensitivity of @xmath1 ergs s@xmath2 .",
    "there are 445 acis sources matched to 2mass point sources with @xmath288 separation .",
    "further visual inspection of an archival hst image and sirius @xmath31 images yield a total of 616 onir counterparts .",
    "we estimate the extragalactic contaminants via a careful simulation of detection efficiency of the background agn population , and conclude that no more than 4% of our detections are agns .",
    "similarly we adopt the besanon stellar population sythesis model of the galactic disk and suggest 11 stars as foreground objects based on their x - ray softness and nir color .",
    "excluding @xmath29 x - ray sources without onir identifications that are possible agns , the rest of the @xmath289 x - ray sources without onir counterparts are likely new pismis 24 members that are clustered around the massive stars and/or deeply embedded in the cloud .",
    "the x - ray detected population provides the first deep probe of the rich population of this massive cluster , increasing the number of known members from optical study by a factor of @xmath3 .",
    "\\2 . on the nir color - color diagram",
    "( figure  [ fig : ccd ] ) , it is clear that acis detects more class iii sources than class ii / i sources . in the color - magnitude plot ( figure  [ fig : cmd ] ) , the locations of most of the acis sources are consistent with being high mass stars and pre - ms intermediate mass stars ( @xmath290 ) , subjected to a visual extinction of @xmath151 at 2.5 kpc . the new high mass stars , if spectroscopically confirmed , double the known high mass population of the cluster .",
    "dozens of intermediate mass stars are newly recognized members of the cluster .",
    "the ratio between class iii and class ii objects in the intermediate- to high - mass range is @xmath152 .",
    "this is an important new sample for stellar and disk studies of intermediate mass pre - ms stars .",
    "the brightness of several k - excess sources makes them extremely favorable for ground based follow - up .",
    "we find a very luminous x - ray emitting infrared source subjected to significant absorption , which may be a new obscured massive yso or a wolf - rayet star .",
    "we determine the spatial distribution of over 700 new members to sub - arcsecond precision for the first time .",
    "the cluster is roughly spherically symmetric , with the highest stellar density around the massive o3 stars .",
    "a density enhancement centered at the tip of the molecular filament deserves further investigation ( figure  [ fig : stellar_density ] ) .",
    "a radial profile of the stellar surface density shows that the physical size of the cluster spans over 2 pc in radius and extends beyond 6 pc ( figure  [ fig : offaxis_hist ] ) .",
    "xlfs are derived for lightly obscured and heavily obscured stellar populations in ngc 6357 ( figure  [ fig : xlf ] ) .",
    "the high x - ray luminosity end ( @xmath291 ergs s@xmath2 ) of the ngc 6357 xlf is clearly consistent with a power law relation as seen in coup and cep b , allowing a scaling comparison with the coup xlf .",
    "the first estimate of the total cluster population of pismis 24 is a few times the known orion population .",
    "the presence of two o3 stars is consistent with the standard imf .",
    "we detect all 10 known ob stars with spectral type earlier than b1 in the pismis 24 cluster , including the wc7+o7 binary wr 93 .",
    "their @xmath236 ratios are consistent with the canonical @xmath292 value with less than an order of magnitude scatter .",
    "the o3 stars pis 24 - 1 ( o3.5if ) and pis 24 - 17 ( o3.5iiif ) exhibit x - ray luminosities @xmath293 ergs s@xmath2 .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of pis 24 - 1 shows a soft emission component ( @xmath294 kev ) and a harder component ( @xmath295 kev ) , while pis 24 - 17 exhibits an unusally strong sixiii  line with a soft @xmath296 kev thermal plasma .",
    "the wc7+o7 binary wr93 is the brightest x - ray source in the field ( @xmath297 ) .",
    "its hard spectrum suggests that the x - ray emission is generated from colliding winds .",
    "the lightcurves of these massive stars are constant through the observation .",
    "we assembled a list of candidate o stars from sources with high x - ray and infrared luminosity to facilitate future spectroscopy follow - up .",
    "four candidate haebe stars are also identified .",
    "we report the detection of x - ray emission from an egg at the tip of a molecular pillar , which was previously found to be an ir source and the peak of the radio continuum .",
    "it is in the early evolutionary of stages of star formation .",
    "the spectral type estimated from its sed is b0b2 .",
    "the non - detection of eggs in the eagle nebula may be the result of lower stellar mass and earlier evolutionary phases .",
    "we assemble a sample of 16 deeply embedded objects .",
    "several flaring sources exhibit luminosities above @xmath298 ergs s@xmath2 , which is exceptionally high for pre - ms stars .",
    "one powerful flare seen in acis # 672 ( cxou j172457.87 - 341203.9 ) is comparable to the strongest x - ray flares known in pre - ms stars ( @xmath299 ergs s@xmath2 ) .",
    "its lightcurve rises 15 times above the quiescent level during the flare , with a slow rise phase that is distinct from the fast rise flares seen pre - ms stars .",
    "soft unresolved x - ray emission in the ngc 6357 region is present .",
    "however , the luminosity derived from spectral fitting is consistent with the estimated level of integrated emission from the unresolved pre - ms stars .",

    "<S> we investigate the structure of the cluster , finding small - scale substructures superposed on a spherical cluster with 6 pc extent , and discuss its relationship to the nebular morphology . the long - standing @xmath6 correlation for o stars </S>",
    "<S> is confirmed . </S>",
    "<S> twenty - four candidate o stars and one possible new obscured massive yso or wolf - rayet star are presented . </S>",
    "<S> many cluster members are estimated to be intermediate - mass stars from available infrared photometry ( assuming an age of @xmath7 myr ) , but only a few exhibit @xmath8-band excess . </S>",
    "<S> we report the first detection of x - ray emission from an evaporating gaseous globule at the tip of a molecular pillar ; this source is likely a b0-b2 protostar . </S>"
