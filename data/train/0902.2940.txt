    "the profiles of circularly polarized radiation or stokes @xmath0 profiles of absorption lines are used most often to study the magnetic field structure and the motion of matter in magnetic features on the sun . they are observed not only at the locations of strong magnetic concentrations in the plages and networks but also in the quiet sun , where weak internetwork fields prevail . according to polarimetric observation data @xcite , the stokes @xmath0 profiles ( hereinafter referred to as  profiles  ) in active and quiet regions on the sun are variable in shape . in dynamic inhomogeneous atmospheres",
    "the profiles are almost without exception asymmetric due to the gradient of the magnetic and velocity fields along the line of sight @xcite . depending on their complexity",
    ", the profiles are said to be usual ( two lobes of opposite signs , fig .",
    "1 ) or unusual ( three and more lobes or a single lobe , fig .",
    "2 ) .     profile of the fe i 630.2  nm line synthesized inside a strong flux tube of negative polarity .",
    "the profile shape is described by the amplitudes @xmath2 , and areas @xmath3 of the blue and red wings , by the zero - crossing @xmath4 and by the amplitude and area asymmetry parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 . ]",
    "profiles of the fe i 630.2  nm line . ]",
    "the asymmetry of usual profiles has been studied quite well @xcite .",
    "outside sunspots at the disk center the majority of usual profiles have positive asymmetry of amplitudes and areas , i.e. , the blue wing is stronger than the red one ; the amplitude asymmetry is greater , on the average , than the asymmetry of areas .",
    "unusual profiles were first found in sunspot penumbrae @xcite .",
    "their origin was attributed to unresolved fine magnetic structures with opposite polarities and to various flows of matter in them @xcite .",
    "later on , unusual profiles were observed in active regions @xcite , they were most often met along the neutral line .",
    "they were explained by siphon flows @xcite or by a superposition of two or more magnetic components of different polarities in the same spatially resolved magnetic element @xcite .",
    "in addition to the two - component or three - component models with magnetic fields of opposite polarities , the idea of magnetic field microstructuring @xcite was also used . within the scope of this idea the magnetic field in plages",
    "was regarded as a statistical of very small , optically thin , nearly vertical magnetic elements frozen in a nonmagnetic medium with downflows . using the inversion method ,",
    "the authors of @xcite successfully reproduced various unusual profiles observed in network and internetwork fields .",
    "some important results were obtained by simulating various situations in the behavior of atmospheric parameters . some specific magnetic and velocity field configurations which are separated in space and which produce the observed extremely asymmetric profiles were discussed in @xcite .",
    "joint influence of the magnetopause and the temperature inversion on profile shape can be a cause of strong asymmetry @xcite .",
    "a considerable number of unusually shaped profiles ( about 3.5 percent ) in quiet regions were first found in observations with a spatial resolution better than @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "analysis of these observations @xcite revealed that those unusual profiles mostly appeared in clusters in bipolar active regions near the neutral line , where strong linear polarization is observed . to account for the complicated line shapes ,",
    "the authors of @xcite supposed that they are formed in the superposition of usual profiles with opposite polarities ( the so - called mixed - polarity profiles ) .",
    "the appearance of mixed - polarity profiles far from the neutral line was explained by the presence of small magnetic bipolar loops @xcite or highly inclined fields @xcite in the photosphere .",
    "such profiles can also appear due to the turbulent @xcite or granulation @xcite character of the magnetic field generated by local granulation flows ; in this case multiple polarity reversal are also possible in magnetic internetwork fields .",
    "observations @xcite confirmed the presence of unusual profiles in quiet regions and found that their fraction depends on spatial resolution , spectral line , and magnetic flux . a decrease in the magnetic flux results in a greater fraction of unusual profiles .",
    "thus , several mechanisms were proposed for the extreme asymmetry of the stokes @xmath0 profiles .",
    "they can be tested through a sophisticated treatment of the stokes profiles with a very high spatial resolution such that the photospheric surface structures may not affect the profiles .",
    "the highest resolution profiles can be obtained only in the numerical mhd simulation of magneto - convection @xcite .",
    "analysis of such profiles allows to study the causes of the unusual profile asymmetry .",
    "it needs no scenarios of unusual profile formation , and it proposes a model atmosphere which fits the solutions of mhd equations .",
    "this approach is successfully used in the solar physics @xcite , it proved to be very fruitful in the investigation of the stokes profile formation , and a wide variety of synthetic unusual profiles were obtained .",
    "in this paper we continue our research @xcite on the origin of unusual profiles using the synthetic stokes profiles and the results of the 2-d mhd models @xcite .",
    "the inhomogeneous atmosphere parameters necessary for calculating the profiles were derived by gadun @xcite in the 2-d mhd simulation of magneto - convection .",
    "the simulated region dimensions were 3920@xmath71820 km with a spatial step of 35 km .",
    "the atmospheric layer extended over about 700 km .",
    "the initial model was nonmagnetic , two - dimensional , and hydrodynamical .",
    "the initial magnetic field was taken in the form of a loop with strength varying with depth .",
    "the field strength averaged over the entire calculation region @xmath8 was equal to 5.4  mt , with the upper and lower boundary conditions @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the peculiarity of the adopted initial field was that the field and the initial mhd model atmosphere parameters were not self - consistent at the initial moment , so that the initial field was chosen such that it might correspond in the best manner to the topology of flows and the equipartition conditions in the simulated region .    at the beginning of simulation",
    "the initial field and the diffusion field ( which spreads into the simulation region ) accumulate at the simulation region base , where the field strength should be greater by the equipartition condition .",
    "the possible mechanism for the magnetic field accumulation are the topological pumping caused by density gradient @xcite and the local dynamo in the upper turbulized layers of the convective zone @xcite .",
    "the dynamo mechanism is activated when the kinetic energy exceeds the magnetic one and the supply of the magnetic energy can be replenished .",
    "figure 2 in @xcite shows that the kinetic energy prevails for a long time in the subphotospheric layers in the mhd models we use , and the magnetic field seems to be generated there through the dynamo mechanism . at the same time , in the atmospheric layers this mechanism works for the first 20 minutes only and the magnetic field distribution is mainly chaotic ( turbulent ) at that time .",
    "concurrently with the dynamo mechanism , the kinematic mechanism also works in the simulation region  the magnetic field is pushed out from the central parts of convection cells by ascending convective flows , and the field lines are concentrated at the cell edges , where downflows are located .",
    "this mechanism remains efficient until the field achieves the equipartition level .",
    "the kinematic mechanism in the solar photosphere can provide concentrations of 70100 mt fields at the level of radiating layer in the region of downflows .",
    "next the thermal mechanism , or convective collapse , comes into effect ",
    "the magnetic field concentrated by the kinetic mechanism prevents reverse flows from penetrating into the magnetic concentration , and thus the concentration becomes supercooled and descends into deeper layers , causing the magnetic field force line tension .",
    "a low - pressure region is formed in the upper part of this magnetic configuration , oscillations arise in the configuration as a result , and it becomes unstable .",
    "the principal peculiarity of this mechanism is that it depends on the size of downflow region ",
    "the wider the region , the higher is the probability for convective collapse to develop .",
    "there is one more factor which facilitates the concentration of vertical magnetic field in the photospheric layers  the surface mechanism which begins to operate in the course of fragmentation of ascending large - scale convective cells @xcite .",
    "horizontal surface fields are captured by descending plasma at the granule center and are carried to deeper layers , where they form compact magnetic plumes intensified by the thermal effect .    by the action of all the above mechanisms over a simulation period of 50 min ,",
    "the magnetic field attains the strength @xmath11 mt .",
    "the strong magnetic concentration ( flux tubes ) thus formed begin to act on the surrounding plasma ",
    "bright dots are observed , oscillating ascending / descending flows appear in intergranular lanes .",
    "the granulation pattern also changes .",
    "the magnetic field has a stabilizing effect on granulation  the granules themselves and their horizontal shear displacements become smaller . kilogauss magnetic flux tubes are formed and develop further in the simulation region",
    ". sometimes flux tubes of opposite polarities annihilate and tubes of the same polarity merge .",
    "areas between flux tubes are filled with nearly horizontal weak magnetic fields of mixed polarity .",
    "the mean field strength varies from 40 to 50 mt over the whole simulation region .",
    "for this study we took a one - hour long sequence of mhd models after 60 min of simulation .",
    "the time step is 60 s before the moment 94 min and 30 s after it .",
    "we used 86 snapshots of the simulated atmosphere .",
    "each snapshot has 112 columns , the stokes profiles of the fe  i line @xmath12  630.2 nm were calculated for each column by integrating the unno - rachkovskii lte equations . in all , 9632 profiles were obtained .",
    "these profiles correspond to those observed in the quiet network and internetwork at the solar disk center , where there are strong fields of magnetic flux tubes of about 150  mt and weak granule fields from 70 to 1  mt at the level @xmath13 .    the neutral iron line @xmath12  630.2  nm is best suite for our calculations .",
    "its stokes profiles are highly sensitive to the magnetic field and velocity field gradients in the solar photosphere at levels from 0.0 to @xmath144.0 on the logarithmic scale of optical depths .",
    "the mean depth of the @xmath12 630.2 nm line formation along columns in inhomogeneous models can vary from @xmath140.5 to @xmath141.5 depending on model parameter variations , and therefore it is hard to specify some average level of the formation of line profiles in an inhomogeneous atmosphere .",
    "it should also be noted that solar polarimetry observations are most often made in the @xmath12  630.2  nm line @xcite .",

    "groups of usual as well as unusual profiles with small zeeman splitting can be seen ; the profiles with large splitting are marked off by solid line .",
    "they are located in a strong magnetic field region where a strong flux tube develops .",
    "the cases when the profile amplitudes @xmath15 and the areas @xmath16 are equal ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) are very rare in inhomogeneous atmospheres .",
    "these equalities are violated , as a rule , and almost all profiles are asymmetric .",
    "one can see in fig .",
    "3 that the groups of usual profiles with two well - defined lobes surround unusual profiles with several lobes or with a single lobe . at the periphery of flux tubes , profiles with four or three peak",
    "are often found .",
    "we found a wide variety of shapes among the synthesized unusual profiles .",
    "we classified them by the number of lobes rather than by the profile shape .",
    "while the usual profiles have only two lobes , the unusual ones may have from one to six lobes .",
    "the probability @xmath19 that a profile with @xmath20 lobes will appear depends on limiting minimal lobe amplitude ; we specify this amplitude from the ratio @xmath21 in each profile .",
    "table 1 gives the occurrence of profiles with different number of lobes at different limiting minimal lobe amplitudes .",
    "low - amplitude lobes in the observed profiles are smoothed by atmospheric and instrumental effects , and we took a sample of unusual profiles with @xmath22 percent for the further analysis because in this sample the number of one - lobe profiles is comparable to observation data .",
    "all profiles with two lobes are classed with usual profiles .",
    "it is not improbable that some profiles with lobes of the same sign can be among them , but their number is insignificant .",

    "one can see the one - lobe absorption @xmath0 profile of the circularly polarized light emerging at the surface .",
    "when the profiles are compared , it is apparent that the level of effective formation of the line @xmath12  630.2  nm profile lies in the temperature region about 5000  k. the position of this effective region in the inhomogeneous atmosphere is shown in fig .",
    "7a by a dashed thick curve on the background of the magnetic field strength distribution .",
    "the depression contribution in the profile of emerging polarized radiation are the greatest in every column near this temperature layer .",
    "it is significant that temperature rises near flux tubes .",
    "this rise is manifested the so - called hot walls which always appear in the upper flux tube layers due to magnetoconvection @xcite .",
    "considering the vertical velocity profile ( @xmath32 ) in a given column ( fig .",
    "7d ) and the velocity pattern in the surrounding space ( fig .",
    "7c ) , one can notice a flow which is directed towards the flux tube and which fosters the field concentration in the flux tube .",
    "the profile we consider here is formed in the region where the velocity gradient changes its sign from negative to positive when going from deeper layers to upper ones . as a result ,",
    "the blue doppler shifts of the contribution function profiles are different at different photospheric levels so that the integrated profile is strongly shifted to shorter wavelengths .",
    "thus , a sudden drop of velocity with growing height gave rise to a stronger blue wing in the profile .    as the magnetic field strength decreases with increasing height ( fig .",
    "7d ) , the magnetic splitting becomes weaker and the distance between the contribution profile lobes decreases , while the change in the magnetic field direction along the line of sight reverses the shape of the contribution function .",
    "due to such intricate combinations of contribution functions , the intensities in the red profile wing compensate one another .",
    "the cause of the polarity change along the line of sight is evident from fig .",
    "7b  this is a kink of magnetic field lines in the region of the ascending convective flow which carries the horizontal magnetic field .",
    "thus , when all the above - mentioned effects are integrated over all layers , the contributions with opposite signs are compensated in the red wing and are accumulated in the blue wing .",
    "the major contribution to profile formation is made in the lower photospheric layers , where the magnetic field has the positive polarity . as a result",
    ", the integrated profile has a blue wing with negative amplitude . the polarity change and the negative field strength gradient in the region of profile formation",
    "suppress the red wing , while the negative gradient of vertical velocity enhances the blue wing .",
    "our analysis of the formation of a large number of blue one - wing profiles revealed that the negative velocity gradient along the line of sight and the polarity change are typical for them , while the field strength gradient can be negative as well as positive .",
    "the field strength gradient along the line of sight can also change its sign .",
    "therefore , the presence of blue profiles in granules suggests that the field polarity changes its sign there , there are significant negative gradients of vertical velocities of upflows , and that various gradients of the weak magnetic field strength can be met .",
    "the sign of wing amplitude is indicative of the field polarity in the layer most efficient in the formation of the given profile .",
    "the conditions for the granular red profile formation differ from those for blue profiles in that the upflow velocity gradient is predominantly positive , i.e. , the velocity amplitude increases with height ( fig .",

    "profile with red wing near a strong flux tube ( designations are the same as in fig . 7 ) . ]",
    "the red profiles are formed in the intergranular lanes with weak magnetic field when downflow velocities in the effective formation region exceed 2 km / s .",
    "when the velocities are lower , the probability for a blue wing only to be formed is much higher . if there are strong flux tubes in the lane , the red profiles are formed more often than the blue ones on their periphery .",
    "figure 8 illustrates the formation of an intergranular red profile on the periphery of a strong flux tube ( @xmath38  km , @xmath39  min , column 24 in figs 4,5 ) .",
    "steep negative gradients of downflow velocity and field strength can be seen in the effective profile formation region .",
    "there also is a small region when the polarity changes its sign . as a result",
    ", a quite wide red wing is formed and the blue wing is suppressed .",
    "red peripheral one - wing profiles as well as blue ones located on the zero line and on the neutral line between granules and lanes are formed in the regions where the velocities are close to zero and their gradients are insignificant so that the gradients of magnetic field strength and direction have a dominant role there .",
    "our analysis revealed that the one - wing profiles are formed only when the magnetic field polarity changes along the line of sight and when there are the velocity and field strength gradients .",
    "so , the appearance of one - wing profiles points unambiguously to the presence of inhomogeneous magnetic fields of different polarities in the photosphere .",
    "the shape of these profiles is difficult to use for the diagnostics of physical conditions in magnetic structures , because there are various factors which can affect this shape .",
    "first of all , this is a horizontal nonuniformity of the solar surface structure @xcite . in this analysis we investigated the profile asymmetry without averaging and found that structure irregularities can occur in inhomogeneous models along the line of sight as well , and they heavily affect the shape of the stokes profiles .",
    "we also found that the shape of one - wing profiles depends on their location on the granular surface of the photosphere .",
    "we may state , therefore , that the predominance of blue one - wing profiles in the region observed attests to the domination of almost horizontal weak granular magnetic fields .",
    "the predominance of red profiles can testify that there are mixed strong and weak magnetic fields and considerable field strength and velocity gradients in the region .",
    "* multilobe profile .",
    "* we used the contribution functions to analyze a large number of multilobe profiles and the conditions of their formation .",
    "it has been ascertained that in all instances the polarity changed one or more times along the line of sight whatever the profile located may be  near the neutral line , far from it in a granule , or in a lane at a flux tube periphery .",
    "gradients of velocity and field strength also are requisite , with the gradient sign changing very often .",
    "the greater the number of lobes in the profile , the more intricate are the gradient profiles .     profile with three lobes ( designations are the same as in fig.7 ) . ]",

    "figure 9 illustrates the formation of a typical three - lobe profiles which is often met in observations .",
    "column 106 ( see figs 4,5 ) , along which the profile was calculated , is located far from a flux tube in an upflow ( @xmath40  km , @xmath41  min ) .",
    "we purposely chose this example so that the velocity gradient might be similar to the gradient considered earlier in the blue one - wing profile in fig .",
    "7 . nevertheless , the magnetic field gradient is different in these two profiles . here",
    "the field strength decreases with growing height in the profile formation region , and then it increases .",
    "it is precisely this gradient sign change that produces a three - lobe profile .",
    "four - lobe profiles are also often observed .",
    "an example of such a profile formed in a stable downflow is seen in fig .",
    "10 ( @xmath42  km , @xmath43  min , column 104 in figs 4,5 ) .",
    "fragmentation of a large granule and formation of a flux tube begin in this region ( figs 10a  c ) .",
    "these processes are described in detail in @xcite .",
    "the vertical profiles of atmospheric parameters ( figs 10d , e ) indicate that there are two factors which affect the profile shape and give rise to four lobes : ( @xmath44 ) the strong horizontal magnetic field of about 100  mt which is concentrated in deep photospheric layers and which becomes weaker with increasing height and then remains almost unchanged ( this situation is similar to a magnetopause ) and ( @xmath45 ) the polarity change in the magnetic field carried by an intense plasma flow into deeper layers .",
    "the vertical velocity of the downflow has a small gradient and slightly affects the profile shape .",
    "the number of lobes depends on the combination of all asymmetry factors in each specific case .",
    "the formation of multilobe profiles is related to more intricate structures of velocity field and magnetic field and to more frequent gradient sign changes . for these profiles",
    "it is difficult to find necessary combinations of all three parameters ( velocity , field strength , and field inclination ) and their gradients . besides",
    ", we do not see any considerable difference between the mechanism of formation of one - lobe and multilobe profiles .",
    "they all arise due to polarity changes and changes in the sign of the velocity and field strength gradients .",
    "thus , the main cause of extreme asymmetry is the growth of magnetic field structurization , which occurs most often not far from intense matter downflows , where flux tubes are being formed , or near already existing strong flux tubes .",
    "we synthesized 9632 stokes @xmath0 profiles based on the inhomogeneous model atmospheres obtained in the numerical 2-d solar magnetogranulation simulation @xcite .",
    "the highest amplitude of the wing in the weakest calculated profile was @xmath46 .",
    "the number of extremely asymmetric profiles with the number of lobes smaller and greater than two depends on the limit chosen for the amplitude of the minimal lobe .",
    "this limit can be taken as one percent for the calculated profiles . to compare our results to observations",
    ", we took a limiting amplitude ratio of 25 percent . with this value , the fraction on calculated one - lobe profiles corresponded to observations @xcite .",
    "the unusual profiles made up 48 and 21 percent of all calculated profiles when the limiting amplitude ratio was 1 and 25 percent , respectively .",
    "the results of the observation @xcite and of the synthesis with 3-d mhd models @xcite suggest that unusual profiles comprise about 35 percent in the profile sample with @xmath47 greater than 0.0015 or 0.001 .",
    "the comparison of our results with observations is not sufficiently correct because the number of unusual profiles found in observations was not referred to all observed profiles .",
    "there may be some discrepancy caused by differences in the magnetic fluxes and by the use of a two - dimensional approximation in the mhd models .",
    "the granulation motions of matter in the 2-d simulated space necessarily differ from actual motions , and this reflects on the magnetic field structure and profile shapes .",
    "the synthesized extremely asymmetric @xmath0 profiles demonstrated some peculiarities found earlier in the polarimetric observations outside active regions made with a spatial resolution better than one second of arc @xcite .",
    "our simulation also revealed that unusual profiles are often grouped near neutral lines and at the periphery of regions with flux tubes , avoiding their central parts .",
    "the shapes and shifts of these unusual profiles can be different , the profiles with three and four lobes being of most frequent occurrence .",
    "our analysis with the use of depression contribution functions confirmed the conclusions made in @xcite that the one - lobe stokes @xmath0 profiles are formed in the solar photosphere due to the joint action of the gradients of velocity fields and magnetic fields of mixed polarities , with the polarities changing not only on the surface bat along the line of sight as well .",
    "the effect of these polarity changes can not be detected in direct observations , it became evident only in simulations , and it points to a complicated structure of magnetic fields caused by granulation motions .",
    "all extremely asymmetric profiles are of the same nature whatever the number of lobes and their shape .",
    "the major prerequisite for the formation of unusual profiles is the change of magnetic field polarity along the line of sight ( there may be one change or several ones ) .",
    "the gradients of matter velocity , of magnetic field strength and inclination , which are the main cause of usual classical asymmetry , still remain important factors in the formation of unusual profiles , and the number of profile lobes is proportional to the frequency of changes in the sign of the magnetic field strength gradient along the line of sight .",
    "various combinations of all these factors as well as the variability of main atmospheric parameters in the region of profile formation give rise to a great diversity of profile shapes .        _",
    "what physical processes are responsible for the most frequently met types of unusual profiles ? _ the turbulent and convective motions of plasma and the formation of magnetic concentrations during the fragmentation of big granules are instrumental in producing a complicated structure of magnetic fields with sign - variable gradients of field strength and inclination .    _",
    "are one - lobe profiles the extreme case of unusual profiles ? _ they might be reckons as such from the standpoint of profile shape , but as far as the origin of unusual profiles is concerned , the profiles with four and more lobe should be regarded as the extreme case of asymmetry .      _ why these unusual profiles have never been observed inside strong kilogauss fields ? _ strong magnetic flux tubes with field strength of more than 100  mt are almost without exception vertical in the region of profile formation , and no polarity changes occur in this case .",
    "_ can profile shapes be used for preliminary diagnostics of observed solar surface areas ? _ the appearance of unusual profiles is indicative of a complicated magnetic field structure in both the horizontal direction and the vertical one , but they say nothing about the field strength .",
    "the magnetic fields are often weak and nearly horizontal in the regions of ascending magnetic flux .",
    "sometimes they can be inclined in the magnetic canopy regions not far from flux tubes , and they can be nearly vertical near kilogauss flux tubes .      there is no doubt that the extreme asymmetry of @xmath0 profiles with one or several lobes is dictated by the fine magnetic field structure produced by turbulent plasma motions in the regions where the convection penetrates into the photosphere ( the magneto - convection processes ) .",
    "three - dimensional hydromagnetic simulations @xcite demonstrated the existence of a complicated surface granulation structure and the crucial importance of intense downdraft in the solar convection .",
    "it is these downdraft that control much more extensive ascending convective flow and smaller turbulent motions .",
    "the authors of @xcite sketched the following broad outlines of solar convection .",
    "the ascending warm convective flows have low density and medium entropy .",
    "while ascending , they spread in order to conserve mass , since the density is lower in the upper layers .",
    "only a small part of ascending material reaches the surface , where its energy and entropy are carried away by radiation ; thus the material density increases , and this heavier material forms a downflow .",
    "this descending material forms intensive downdrafts in the lower layers , obeying the law of mass conservation ; shifting motions arise at the downflow borders , and they produce eddies and turbulence . to the contrary , in the ascending matter the level of fluctuations is very low because the spreading smooths all disturbances . as a result , we observed laminar upflows and turbulent downflows .",
    "when we supplement this picture with a magnetic field , which is frozen in the plasma under the solar plasma conditions , we can easily understand why magnetic field lines have complicated configurations at the borders of granules and lanes .",
    "the relationship between magnetic field and convection was demonstrated in two - dimensional mhd simulations of magneto - convection @xcite as well as in three - dimensional ones @xcite .",
    "observations @xcite and the results of numerical simulations of the stokes profiles @xcite also pointed to a strong interdependence of magnetic fields in quiet regions and local convection processes .    in this study , which is based on the results of the stokes profile synthesis and the 2d - mhd simulations of nonstationary magneto - convection , we demonstrated that the main cause of the formation of unusually shaped profiles is the complicated structure of the magnetic field with its polarity changing along the line of sight and the complicated gradients of velocity and field strength at granule and lane borders .",
    "such conditions favorable for the formation of unusual profiles arise due to the local turbulence produced in the surface magneto - convection by shifting motions at the borders of powerful downflows",

    "<S> the unusual @xmath0 profiles may have from one to six lobes . </S>",
    "<S> the one - lobe and multilobe profiles are of the same origin . </S>",
    "<S> the processing causing the extreme asymmetry of the profiles are characterized by one or several polarity reversal along the line of sight as well as by complicated velocity and field strength gradients . </S>",
    "<S> the greater the number of profile lobes , the greater is the probability of the field gradient sign change . </S>",
    "<S> hence it follows that the magnetic field should be very complicated in the regions of formation of extremely asymmetric @xmath0 profiles . </S>",
    "<S> this is confirmed by immediate results of mhd granulation simulations , which demonstrate the formation of vortices and turbulence by the velocity shear at down draft edges . </S>",
    "<S> these processes add complexity to the magnetic field structure by mixing field polarities , particularly at the edges of granules . </S>",
