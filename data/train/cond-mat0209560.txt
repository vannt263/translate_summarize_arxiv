    "most of the interesting expansions in non - equilibrium statistical physics are divergent .",
    "this paraphrase of the well known folklore `` dorfman s theorem '' conveys the intrinsic problem of many - body systems : a number of systematic ( at the first glance ) methods has led to ( a ) . an excellent but already known on the phenomenological grounds first approximation .",
    "already the next correction , not known phenomenologically and hence of interest , does not exist because of a divergence .",
    "there are many examples of this situations : cluster expansion of the exact collision integral for dense gases lead to divergent approximations of transport coefficients , non - convergent long tails of correlation functions in the green - kubo formulae etc .",
    "derivation of the hydrodynamic equations from a microscopic description is the classical problem of physical kinetics .",
    "as is well known , the famous chapman - enskog method @xcite provides an opportunity to compute a solution from the boltzmann kinetic equation as a formal series in powers of the knudsen number @xmath0 .",
    "the parameter @xmath0 reflects the ratio between the mean free path of a particle , and the scale of variations of the hydrodynamic fields , the density , the mean flux , and the temperature .",
    "if the chapman - enskog expansion is truncated at a certain order , we obtain subsequently : the euler hydrodynamics ( @xmath1 ) , the navier - stokes hydrodynamics ( @xmath2 ) , the burnett hydrodynamics ( @xmath3 ) , the super - burnett hydrodynamics ( @xmath4 ) , etc .",
    "the post - navier - stokes terms extend the hydrodynamic description beyond the strictly hydrodynamic limit @xmath5 .",
    "however , as it has been first demonstrated by bobylev @xcite , even in the simplest regime ( one - dimensional linear deviations around the global equilibrium ) , the burnett hydrodynamic equations violate the basic physics behind the boltzmann equation .",
    "namely , sufficiently short acoustic waves are increasing with time instead of decaying .",
    "this contradicts the @xmath6-theorem , since all near - equilibrium perturbations must decay .",
    "the situation does not improve in the next , super - burnett approximation .",
    "this `` ultra - violet catastrophe '' which occurs in the lower - order truncations of the chapman - enskog expansion creates therefore very serious difficulties in the problem of an extension of the hydrodynamic description into a highly non - equilibrium domain ( see @xcite for a discussion of other difficulties of the post - navier  stokes terms of the chapman - enskog expansion ) . the euler and the navier  stokes approximations remain basic in the hydrodynamic description , while the problem of their extension is one of the central open problems of the kinetic theory",
    ". the study of approximate solutions based on the chapman - enskog method still continues @xcite .",
    "all this begs for a question : _ what is wrong with the chapman - enskog method ?",
    "_ at the first glance , the failure of the burnett and of the super - burnett hydrodynamics may be accounted in favor of a frequently used argumentation about the asymptotic character of the chapman - enskog expansion .",
    "however , it is worthwhile to notice here that divergences in the low - order terms of formal expansions are not too surprising . in many occasions ,",
    "in particular , in quantum field theory @xcite and in statistical physics @xcite , the situation is often improved if one takes into account the very remote terms of corresponding expansions .",
    "thus , a more constructive viewpoint on the chapman - enskog expansion could be to proceed along these lines , and to try to _ sum up _ the chapman - enskog series , at least formally and approximately .",
    "an attempt of this kind of working with the chapman - enskog expansion is undertaken in this paper .",
    "the formalities are known to be rather awkward for the boltzmann equation , and untill now , exact summations of the chapman - enskog expansion are known in a very limited number of cases @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will concentrate on the chapman - enskog method as applied to the well known grad moment equations @xcite .",
    "the use of the grad equations for our purpose brings , of course , considerable technical simplifications as compared to the case of the boltzmann equation but it does not make the problem trivial . indeed , the chapman - enskog method amounts to a nonlinear recurrence procedure even as applied to the simplest , linearized grad equations .",
    "moreover , as we will see it soon , the chapman - enskog expansion for moment systems inherits bobylev s instability in the low - order approximations .",
    "still , the advantage of our approach is that many explicit results can be obtained and analyzed . in order to summarize , in this paper",
    "we consider grad s moment equations as finitely - coupled kinetic models where the problem of reduced description is meaningful , rather than as models of extended hydrodynamics .",
    "the latter viewpoint is well known as a microscopic background of the extended irreversible thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : after an introduction of the chapman - enskog procedure for the linearized grad equations ( section [ g_intro ] ) , we will open the discussion with two examples ( the linearized one- and three - dimensional 10 moment grad equations ) where the chapman - enskog series is summed up exactly in a closed form ( sections [ exact_10_1 ] and [ exact_10_3 ] ) .",
    "these results makes it possible to discuss the features of the chapman - enskog solution in the short - wave domain in the frames of the model , and will serve for a purpose of testing various approximate methods thereafter .",
    "we will see , in particular , that the `` smallness '' of the knudsen number @xmath0 used to develop the chapman - enskog method has no direct meaning in the exact result .",
    "also , it will become clear that the finite - order truncations , even provided they are stable , give less opportunities to approximate the solution in a whole , and especially in the short - wave domain .",
    "the exact solutions are , of course , the lucky exceptions , and even for the grad moment equations the complexity of the chapman - enskog method increases rapidly with an increase of the number of the moments taken into account .",
    "further ( section [ ps ] ) we will review a technique of summing the chapman - enskog expansion _",
    "partially_. this technique is heuristic ( as are the methods of partial summing in general ) , but still it removes the bobylev instability , as well as it qualitatively reproduces the features of the exact solutions in the short - wave limit .",
    "the style of working in the sections mentioned so far falls into a paradigm of the taylor - like expansions into powers of the knudsen number .",
    "this viewpoint on the problem of a derivation of the hydrodynamics will be _ altered _ beginning with the section [ di_intro ] . there",
    "we demonstrate that a condition of a _ dynamic invariance _ which can be realized directly and with no request of the knudsen number brings us to the same result as the exact summation of the chapman - enskog expansion .",
    "the chapman - enskog method thereafter can be regarded for a _",
    "one _ possibility to solve the resulting invariance equations .",
    "further , we demonstrate that iterative methods provide a reasonable alternative to the taylor expansion in this problem .",
    "namely , we show that the newton method has certain advantages above the chapman - enskog method ( section [ di_n ] ) .",
    "we also establish a relationship between the method of partial summing and the newton method .",
    "the material of further sections serves for an illustrative introduction how the pair ` invariance equation + newton method ' can be applied to the problems of kinetic theory .",
    "the remaining sections of this chapter are devoted to further examples of this type of working on the level of the grad equations . in sections",
    "[ di_13_1 ] and [ di_13_3 ] we derive and discuss the invariance equations for the linearized thirteen - moment grad equations .",
    "section [ dip ] is devoted to kinetic equations of the grad type , arising in the problems of phonon transport in massive solids at low temperatures .",
    "in particular , we demonstrate that the onset of the second sound regime of phonon propagation corresponds to a branching point of the exact sum of the relevant chapman  enskog expansion .    in section [ nl ]",
    "we apply the invariance principle to nonlinear grad equations .",
    "we sum up exactly a _",
    "subseries _ of the chapman - enskog expansion , namely , the dominant contribution in the limit of high average velocities .",
    "this type of contribution is therefore important for an extension of the hydrodynamic description into the domain of strong shock waves .",
    "we give a relevant analysis of the corresponding invariance equation , and , in particular , discuss the nature of singular points of this equation .",
    "a brief discussion concludes this paper . some of the results presented below were published earlier in @xcite      in this section , for the sake of completeness",
    ", we introduce linearized grad s equations and the chapman - enskog method for them in a form to be used in this paper .",
    "since the chapman - enskog method is extensively discussed in a number of books , especially , in the classical monograph @xcite , our presentation will be brief .",
    "notations will follow those of the papers @xcite .",
    "we denote @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 as the fixed equilibrium values of the density , of the temperature and of the averaged velocity ( in the appropriate galilean reference frame ) , while @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are small deviations of the hydrodynamic quantities from their equilibrium values . grad s moment equations @xcite which will appear below , contain the temperature dependent viscosity coefficient @xmath13 .",
    "it is convenient to write @xmath14 .",
    "the functional form of @xmath15 is dictated by the choice of the model for particle s interaction .",
    "in particular , we have @xmath16 for maxwell s molecules , and @xmath17 for hard spheres .",
    "let us introduce the following system of dimensionless variables : @xmath18 where @xmath19 are spatial coordinates , and @xmath20 is the time .",
    "in the sequel , we use the system of units in which boltzmann s constant @xmath21 and the particle s mass @xmath22 are one .",
    "three - dimensional thirteen moment grad s equations , linearized near the equilibrium , take the following form when written in terms of the dimensionless variables ( [ var ] ) : @xmath23 in these equations , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are dimensionless quantities corresponding to the stress tensor and to the heat flux , respectively .",
    "further , the gradient @xmath26 stands for the vector of spatial derivatives @xmath27 .",
    "the dot denotes the standard scalar product , while the overline stands for a symmetric traceless dyad .",
    "in particular , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is unit matrix .    grad s equations ( [ balanceequations ] ) and ( [ grad133 ] ) is the simplest model of a coupling of the hydrodynamic variables , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , to the non - hydrodynamic variables @xmath24 and @xmath33 .",
    "the problem of reduced description is to close the first three equations ( [ balanceequations ] ) , and to get an autonomous system for the hydrodynamic variables alone . in other words , the non - hydrodynamic variables @xmath24 and @xmath33 should be expressed in terms of the variables @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 . the chapman - enskog method , as applied for this purpose to grad s system ( [ balanceequations ] ) and ( [ grad133 ] ) , involves the following steps :    first , we introduce a formal parameter @xmath0 , and write instead of equations ( [ grad133 ] ) : @xmath34 second , the chapman - enskog solution is found as a formal expansions of the stress tensor and of the heat flux vector : @xmath35 zero - order coefficients , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are : @xmath38 coefficients of the order @xmath39 are found from the recurrence procedure : @xmath40 where @xmath41 are recurrently defined _ chapman - enskog operators_. they act on functions @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and on their spatial derivatives , according to the following rule : @xmath42 here @xmath43 is an arbitrary differential operator with constant coefficients .",
    "given the initial condition ( [ ns133 ] ) , the chapman - enskog equations ( [ procedure133 ] ) and ( [ operators133 ] ) are recurrently solvable . finally , by terminating the computation at the order @xmath44 , we obtain the @xmath45th order approximations to the expansions ( [ expansion ] ) , @xmath46 and @xmath47 : @xmath48 substituting these expressions instead of the functions @xmath49 and @xmath50 in the equations ( [ balanceequations ] ) , we close the latter to give the hydrodynamic equations of the order @xmath45 . in particular , @xmath51 results in the navier - stokes approximation , @xmath52 and @xmath53 give the burnett and the super - burnett approximations , respectively , and so on .    though the ` microscopic ' features of grad s moment equations are , of course , much simpler as compared with the boltzmann equation , the chapman - enskog procedure for them just described is not trivial .",
    "our purpose is to study explicitly the features of the gradient expansions like ( [ expansion ] ) in the highly non - equilibrium domain , in particular , to find out to what extend the finite - order truncations ( [ truncation133 ] ) approximate the solution , and what kind of alternative strategies to find approximations are possible . in the following , when referring to grad s equations , we use the notation @xmath54 , where @xmath22 is the spatial dimension of corresponding fields , and",
    "@xmath55 is the number of these fields .",
    "for example , the above system is the @xmath56 grad s system .",
    "in this section , we open our discussion with the exact summation of the chapman - enskog series for the simplest grad s system , the one - dimensional linearized ten - moment equations . throughout the section we use the hydrodynamic variables",
    "@xmath58 and @xmath59 , representing the dimensionless deviations of the pressure and of the average velocity from their equilibrium values .",
    "the starting point is the linearized grad s equations for @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 , where @xmath62 is the dimensionless @xmath63-component of the stress tensor :    @xmath64    the system of equations for three functions is the derivative of the ten - moment grad s system ( see eq .",

    "provides the simplest model of a coupling of the hydrodynamic variables , @xmath61 and @xmath60 , to the single non - hydrodynamic variable @xmath62 , and corresponds to a heat non - conductive case .",
    "our goal here is to shorten the description , and to get a closed set of equations with respect to variables @xmath60 and @xmath61 only .",
    "that is , we have to express the function @xmath62 in the terms of spatial derivatives of the functions @xmath60 and of @xmath61 . the chapman - enskog method , as applied to eq .",
    "( [ grad101 ] ) results in the following series representation : @xmath65 coefficients @xmath66 are due to the following recurrence procedure @xcite : @xmath67 where the chapman - enskog operators @xmath41 act on @xmath60 , on @xmath61 , and on their spatial derivatives as follows : @xmath68 here @xmath69 is an arbitrary integer , and @xmath70 .",
    "finally , @xmath71 which leads to the navier ",
    "stokes approximation of the stress tensor : @xmath72 .",
    "because of a somewhat involved structure of the recurrence procedure ( [ procedure101 ] ) and ( [ operators101 ] ) , the chapman - enskog method is a nonlinear operation even in the simplest model ( [ grad101 ] ) .",
    "moreover , the bobylev instability is again present .",
    "indeed , computing the coefficients @xmath73 and @xmath74 on the basis of the expressions ( [ procedure101 ] ) , we obtain : @xmath75 and @xmath76 for the burnett and the super - burnett approximations , respectively .",
    "now we can substitute each of the approximations , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 instead of the function @xmath62 in the second of the equations of the set ( [ grad101 ] ) .",
    "then the equations thus obtained , together with the equation for the density @xmath80 , will give us the closed systems of the hydrodynamic equations of the navier - stokes , of the burnett , and of the super - burnett levels . to see the properties of the resulting equations , we compute the dispersion relation for the hydrodynamic modes . using a new space - time scale , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 , and next representing @xmath83 , and @xmath84 ,",
    "where @xmath85 , and @xmath86 is a real - valued wave vector , we obtain the following dispersion relations @xmath87 from the condition of a non - trivial solvability of the corresponding linear system with respect to @xmath88 and @xmath89 : @xmath90 for the navier - stokes approximation ,    @xmath91    for the burnett approximation ( [ burnett101 ] ) , and @xmath92 for the super - burnett approximation ( [ sburnett101 ] ) .",
    "these examples demonstrate that the real part @xmath93 for the navier - stokes ( [ dispersionns101 ] ) and for the burnett ( [ dispersionburnett101 ] ) approximations , for all wave vectors .",
    "thus , these approximations describe attenuating acoustic waves .",
    "however , for the super - burnett approximation , the function @xmath94 ( [ dispersionsburnett101 ] ) becomes positive as soon as @xmath95 .",
    "that is , the equilibrium point is stable within the navier - stokes and the burnett approximation , and it becomes unstable within the super - burnett approximation for sufficiently short waves .",
    "similar to the case of the bobylev instability of the burnett hydrodynamics for the boltzmann equation , the latter result contradicts the dissipative properties of the grad system ( [ grad101 ] ) : the spectrum of the full @xmath57 system ( [ grad101 ] ) is stable for arbitrary @xmath86 .",
    "our goal now is to sum up the series ( [ series101 ] ) in a closed form .",
    "firstly , we will make some preparations .    as was demonstrated in @xcite , the functions @xmath66 in eqs .",

    "the chapman - enskog procedure ( [ procedure101 ] ) and ( [ operators101 ] ) can be represented in terms of the real - valued coefficients @xmath98 and @xmath99 ( [ structure101 ] ) .",

    "knowing the structure ( [ structure101 ] ) of the coefficients of the chapman - enskog expansion ( [ series101 ] ) , we can write down its formal sum .",
    "it is convenient to use the fourier variables introduced above which amounts essentially to the change @xmath100 . substituting the expression ( [ structure101 ] ) into the chapman - enskog series ( [ series101 ] ) , we obtain the following formal expression for the fourier image of the sum : @xmath101 where the functions @xmath102 and @xmath103 are formal power series with the coefficients ( [ structure101 ] ) : @xmath104    thus , the question of the summation of the chapman - enskog series ( [ series101 ] ) amounts to finding the two functions , @xmath105 and @xmath106 ( [ ab101 ] ) .",

    "it is convenient to start with the fourier representation of the equations ( [ procedure101 ] ) and ( [ operators101 ] ) . writing @xmath112 , @xmath113 , and @xmath114 , we obtain the following representation : @xmath115 while @xmath116 and    @xmath117    the navier  stokes and the burnett approximations give @xmath118 , and @xmath119 .",
    "thus , the structure ( [ fstructure101 ] ) is proven for @xmath120 .",
    "the further derivation relies upon induction .",
    "let us assume that the ansatz ( [ fstructure101 ] ) is proven up to the order @xmath55 .",
    "computing the coefficient @xmath121 from the equation ( [ fprocedure101 ] ) , we have : @xmath122 due to the assumption of the induction , we can adopt the form of the coefficients @xmath123 ( [ fstructure101 ] ) in all the terms on the right hand side of the latter expression . on the basis of the expressions ( [ fstructure101 ] ) and ( [ foperators101 ] ) , we conclude that each summand in the last sum in ( [ fodd101 ] ) is equal to zero .",
    "further , the term @xmath124 gives a linear contribution : @xmath125 while the terms in the remaining sum contribute nonlinearly : @xmath126 substituting the last two expressions into the equation ( [ fodd101 ] ) , we see that it has just the same structure as the coefficient @xmath121 in ( [ fstructure101 ] ) .",
    "thus , we come to the first recurrence equation : @xmath127 computing the coefficient @xmath128 by the same pattern , we come to the second recurrence equation , and the chapman - enskog procedure ( [ procedure101 ] ) and ( [ operators101 ] ) becomes the following equivalent formulation in terms of the coefficients @xmath110 and @xmath111 ( [ structure101 ] ) : @xmath129 the initial condition for this set of equations is dictated by the navier - stokes and the burnett terms : @xmath130    our goal now is to compute the functions @xmath107 and @xmath108 ( [ ab101 ] ) on the basis of the recurrence equations ( [ recurrent101 ] ) . at this point , it is worthwhile to notice that usual routes of dealing with the recurrence system ( [ recurrent101 ] ) would be either to truncate it at a certain @xmath55 , or to calculate all the coefficients explicitly , and next to substitute the result into the power series ( [ ab101 ] ) .",
    "both these routes are not successful here . indeed , retaining the coefficients @xmath131 , @xmath132 , and @xmath133",
    "gives the super - burnett approximation ( [ sburnett101 ] ) which has the bobylev short - wave instability , and there is no guarantee that the same failure will not occur in the higher - order truncation . on the other hand ,",
    "a term - by - term computation of the whole set of coefficients @xmath98 and @xmath99 is a quite nontrivial task due to a nonlinearity in the equations ( [ recurrent101 ] ) .",
    "fortunately , another route is possible .",
    "multiplying both the equations in ( [ recurrent101 ] ) with @xmath134 , and performing a formal summation in @xmath55 from zero to infinity , we arrive at the following expressions : @xmath135 now we notice that @xmath136 accounting the initial condition ( [ initialcondition101 ] ) , we come in ( [ intermediate101 ] ) to a pair of coupled quadratic equations for the functions @xmath107 and @xmath108 : @xmath137    the result ( [ system101 ] ) concludes essentially the question of the computation of the functions @xmath107 and @xmath108 ( [ ab101 ] ) .",

[ fig2 ] . in this figure",

    "the exact dispersion relation ( [ frequency101 ] ) of the chapman - enskog procedure is demonstrated to be stable for all wave lengths , while the bobylev instability is present on the level of the super - burnett approximation .",

    "\\(i ) the example considered above gives an opportunity to discuss the features of chapman - enskog solutions and the problem of an extension of the hydrodynamic modes into a highly non - equilibrium domain on the exact basis and in the full spatial dimension . the exact acoustic mode in the framework of the chapman - enskog procedure",
    "is demonstrated to be stable for all wave lengths , while the diffusion - like mode can be regarded for the hydrodynamic mode only in a bounded domain @xmath272 .",
    "it is remarkable that the result of the chapman - enskog procedure has a clear non - polynomial character . as a conjecture here ,",
    "the resulting hydrodynamics is _ essentially _ nonlocal in space .",
    "it is also clear that _ any _ polynomial approximation to the chapman - enskog series will fail to reproduce the peculiarity of the diffusion mode demonstrated in frames of the exact solution .",
    "\\(ii ) concerning an extension of hydrodynamics into a highly non - equilibrium domain on the basis of the boltzmann equations , this question remains open in a sense of an exact summation as above . in this respect ,",
    "results for simplified models can serve either for a test of approximate procedures or at least for a guide .",
    "in particular , the mechanism of the singularity of the diffusion - like mode through a coupling to the non - hydrodynamic mode might be a rather general mechanism of limitation of the hydrodynamic description , and not just a feature of the grad systems .",
    "\\(iii ) the result of this section demonstrates that the sum of the chapman - enskog series amounts to either a quite regular function ( as is the function @xmath157 ) , or to a function with a singularity at finite @xmath273 . in both cases , however , the `` smallness '' of the knudsen number @xmath0 used to develop the chapman - enskog procedure plays no role in the outcome of the chapman - enskog procedure .",
    "the examples considered above demonstrate that it makes sense to speak about the sum of the chapman - enskog expansion , at least when the chapman - enskog method is applied to the ( linearized ) grad equations .",
    "however , even in this case , the possibility to perform the summation exactly seems to be a lucky exceptions rather than a rule .",
    "indeed , computations become more bulky with the increase of the number of the moments included in the grad equations . therefore , we arrive at a question : how can we approximate the recurrence equations of the chapman - enskog method to account all the orders in the knudsen number ?",
    "any such method amounts to some `` partial '' summation of the chapman - enskog expansion , and this type of working with formal series is widely spread in various fields of physics .    in this section",
    "we will discuss a method of approximating the chapman - enskog expansion in a whole . as we now have the exact expressions for the chapman - enskog solution for the linearized 10 moment grad equations , it is natural to start with this example for the reason of comparison .",
    "let us come back to the originating one - dimensional grad equations ( [ grad101 ] ) , and to the corresponding formulas of the chapman - enskog method ( [ procedure101 ] ) and ( [ operators101 ] ) . instead of using the exact equations ( [ procedure101 ] ) in each order @xmath55 , we introduce the following approximate equations :    let @xmath274 is some fixed integer .",
    "then , instead of equations ( [ procedure101 ] ) , we write : @xmath275 this approximation amounts to the following : up to the order @xmath45 , the chapman - enskog procedure ( [ procedure101 ] ) is taken exactly ( equation ( [ regprocedure101a ] ) ) , while in the computations of the higher orders ( equation ( [ regprocedure101b ] ) ) we restrict the set of the chapman - enskog operators ( [ operators101 ] ) only to the order @xmath45 .",
    "thus , the chapman - enskog coefficients @xmath66 of the order higher than @xmath45 are taken into account only `` partially '' .",
    "as @xmath45 tends to infinity , the recurrence procedure ( [ regprocedure101a ] ) and ( [ regprocedure101b ] ) tends formally to the exact chapman - enskog procedure ( [ procedure101 ] ) .",
    "we will further refer to the equations ( [ regprocedure101a ] ) and ( [ regprocedure101b ] ) as to the _ regularization _ of the @xmath276 order .",
    "in particular , taking @xmath52 , we come to the regularization of the burnett approximation , taking @xmath53 we come to the regularization of the super - burnett approximation , etc .",
    "it can be demonstrated that the approximate procedure just described does not alter the structure of the functions @xmath277 and @xmath278 ( [ structure101 ] ) , while the recurrence equations for the coefficients @xmath110 and @xmath111 ( [ structure101 ] ) will differ from the exact result of the full chapman - enskog procedure ( [ recurrent101 ] ) .",
    "the advantage of the regularization procedure ( [ regprocedure101a ] ) and ( [ regprocedure101b ] ) above the exact chapman - enskog recurrence procedure ( [ procedure101 ] ) is that the resulting equations for the coefficients @xmath110 and @xmath111 are always linear , as they appear from the equations ( [ regprocedure101a ] ) and ( [ regprocedure101b ] ) .",
    "this feature enables one to sum up the corresponding series exactly , even if the originating nonlinear procedure leads to a too difficult analysis .",
    "the number @xmath45 can be called the `` depth '' of the approximation : the greater is @xmath45 the more low - order terms of the chapman - enskog expansion are taken into account exactly due to the equations ( [ regprocedure101a ] ) .",
    "for the first example , let us take @xmath52 in the equations ( [ regprocedure101a ] ) and ( [ regprocedure101b ] ) .",
    "the regularization of the burnett approximation in accord with these equations reads : @xmath279 where @xmath280 , and @xmath281 .",
    "turning to the fourier variables , we derive : @xmath282 while the coefficients @xmath110 and @xmath111 are due to the following recurrence procedure : @xmath283 and whereupon @xmath284 thus , denoting as @xmath285 the fourier transform of the regularized burnett approximation , we obtain : @xmath286    it should be noticed that the recurrence equations ( [ reg1recurrent101 ] ) can also be obtained from the exact recurrence equations ( [ recurrent101 ] ) by canceling the nonlinear terms .",
    "thus , the approximation adopted within the regularization procedure ( [ regburnett101 ] ) amounts to the following rational approximation of the functions @xmath107 and @xmath108 ( [ ab101 ] ) : @xmath287 substituting the latter expressions instead of the functions @xmath107 and @xmath108 in the formula for the dispersion ( [ dispersion101 ] ) , we come to the dispersion relation of the hydrodynamic modes within the regularized burnett approximation : @xmath288 the dispersion relation ( [ reg1dispersion101 ] ) is stable for all wave vectors , and in the short - wave limit we have : @xmath289    thus , the regularized burnett approximation leads to a qualitatively the same behavior of the dispersion relation , as it is for the exact result ( [ limit101 ] ) , giving the limiting value of the attenuation rate equal to @xmath290 instead of the exact value @xmath291 .",
    "consider now the regularization of the super - burnett approximation .",
    "this amounts to setting @xmath53 in the recurrence equations ( [ regprocedure101a ] ) and ( [ regprocedure101b ] ) .",
    "then , instead of the equations ( [ regburnett101 ] ) , we have : @xmath292 where @xmath96 .",
    "the corresponding recurrence equations for the coefficients @xmath110 and @xmath111 now are as follows : @xmath293 thus , instead of the expressions ( [ reg1ab101 ] ) , we come to the following : @xmath294 the corresponding dispersion relation of the regularized super - burnett approximation reads : @xmath295 while in the short - wave limit the following asymptotics takes place : @xmath296    the bobylev instability is removed again within the regularization of the super - burnett approximation , and also the lower - order terms of the chapman - enskog expansion are taken into account more precisely in comparison to the regularized burnett approximation .",
    "however , the approximation in a whole has not improved ( see fig .  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "_ thus , we can conclude that though the partial summation method _ ( [ regprocedure101a ] ) _ and _ ( [ regprocedure101b ] )",
    "_ is in a capacity to remove the bobylev instability , and to reproduce qualitatively the exact chapman - enskog solution in the short - wave domain , the exactness , however , does not increase monotonically with the depth of the approximation _ @xmath45 .",
    "this drawback of the regularization procedure indicates once again that an attempt to capture the lower - order terms of the chapman - enskog procedure does not succeed in a better approximation in a whole .",
    "all the procedures considered so far ( exact or approximate ) were taking the chapman - enskog expansion as the starting point",
    ". however , the result of the summation in these procedures does not involve the knudsen number @xmath0 explicitly , neither the sum does apply for a `` smallness '' of this parameter .",
    "therefore , it makes sense to reformulate the problem of the reduced description ( for the grad equations ( [ grad101 ] ) this amounts to the problem of constructing a function @xmath297 ) in a way where the parameter @xmath0 does not come into play at all .",
    "further , in a framework of such an approach , we can seek for a method of explicit constructing the function @xmath297 , and which does not rely upon the taylor - like expansions as above .    in this section",
    "we introduce the approach just mentioned , considering again the illustrative example ( [ grad101 ] ) .",
    "these ideas will be extensively used in the sequel , and they also constitute the basis of the so - called method of invariant manifold for dissipative systems @xcite .",
    "let us rewrite here the equations ( [ grad101 ] ) , in the fourier variables , and canceling the parameter @xmath0 : @xmath298    the result of the reduction in the system ( [ grad101a ] ) amounts to a function @xmath297 , which depend parametrically on the hydrodynamic variables @xmath299 and @xmath89 , and also on the wave vector @xmath86 . due to the linearity of the problem under the consideration , this function depends linearly on @xmath299 and @xmath89 , and we can start with the form given by the equation ( [ sigma101 ] ) : @xmath300 where @xmath107 and @xmath108 are undetermined functions of @xmath86 .",
    "now , however , we do not refer to a power series representation of these functions as in the equations ( [ ab101 ] ) .",
    "given the form of the function @xmath301 ( [ sigma101a ] ) , we can compute its time derivative in _ two _ different ways . on the one hand , substituting the function ( [ sigma101a ] ) into the right hand side of the third of the equations in the set ( [ grad101a ] )",

    "now , however , we have come to the same result without using the expansion .",
    "thus , the equations ( [ invariance101 ] ) ( or , equivalently , ( [ system101 ] ) ) can be used as a starting point for the constructing the function ( [ sigma101a ] ) .",
    "now it is important to comment on the somewhat formal manipulations which have led to the equations ( [ invariance101 ] ) .",
    "first of all , by the very sense of the reduced description problem , we are looking for a set of functions @xmath305 which depend on the time only through the time dependence of the hydrodynamic variables @xmath299 and @xmath89 .",
    "that is , we are looking for a set ( [ sigma101a ] ) , which is parameterized with the values of the hydrodynamic variables .",
    "further , the two time derivatives , ( [ derivative101micro ] ) and ( [ derivative101macro ] ) , are relevant to the `` microscopic '' and the `` macroscopic '' evolution within the set ( [ sigma101a ] ) , respectively .",
    "indeed , the expression in the right hand side of the equation ( [ derivative101micro ] ) is just the value of the vector field of the original grad equation in the points of the set ( [ sigma101a ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the expression ( [ derivative101macro ] ) reflects the time derivative due to the reduced ( macroscopic ) dynamics , which , in turn , is self - consistently defined by the form ( [ sigma101a ] ) .",
    "the equations ( [ invariance101 ] ) provide , therefore , the _ dynamic invariance condition of the reduced description _ for the set ( [ sigma101a ] ) : the function @xmath306 is a solution to both the full grad system ( [ grad101a ] ) and to the reduced system which consists of the two first ( hydrodynamic ) equations .",
    "for this reason , the equations ( [ invariance101 ] ) and their analogs which will be obtained on the similar reasoning , will be called _ the invariance equations_.      let us concentrate on the problem of solving the invariance equations ( [ invariance101 ] ) . clearly , if we are going to develop the functions @xmath107 and @xmath108 into the power series ( [ ab101 ] )",
    ", we will come back to the chapman - enskog procedure .",
    "now , however , we see that the chapman - enskog expansion is just a method to solve the invariance equations ( [ invariance101 ] ) , and maybe not the optimal one .",
    "another possibility is to use _ iterative _ methods . indeed ,",

    "let the regularized burnett approximation ( [ reg1ab101 ] ) is taken for the initial approximation , that is : @xmath318    substituting the expression ( [ initial101 ] ) into the equation ( [ n101 ] ) and ( [ niteration101 ] ) for @xmath120 , and after some algebra , we come to the following first correction : @xmath319 the functions ( [ 1nreg1101 ] ) are not yet the exact solution to the equations ( [ invariance101 ] ) ( that is , the functions @xmath320 and @xmath321 are not equal to zero for all @xmath86 ) .",
    "however , substituting the functions @xmath322 and @xmath323 instead of @xmath107 and @xmath108 into the dispersion relation ( [ dispersion101 ] ) , we derive in the short - wave limit : @xmath324 that is , already the first newton iteration , as applied to the regularized burnett approximation , leads to the exact expression in the short - wave domain .",
    "since the first newton iteration appears to be asymptotically exact , the next iterations improve the solution only for the intermediate values of @xmath86 , whereas the asymptotic behaviour remains exact in all the iterations .",
    "the attenuation rates for the first and for the second newton iterations with the initial approximation ( [ initial101 ] ) are represented in fig .",
    "the agreement with the exact solution is excellent .",
    "a one more test is to take the result of the super - burnett approximation ( [ reg2ab101 ] ) for the initial condition in the newton procedure ( [ niteration101 ] ) . as we know",
    ", the regularization of the super - burnett approximation is provides a poorer approximation in comparison to the approximation ( [ initial101 ] ) , in particular , in the short - wave domain .",
    "nevertheless , the newton iterations do converge though less rapidly ( see fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) .",
    "the examples considered so far demonstrate that the newton method , as applied to the invariance equations ( [ invariance101 ] ) is a more powerful tool in comparison to the chapman - enskog procedure .",
    "it is also important that the initial approximation should be `` properly chosen '' , and should reproduce the features of the solution in a whole ( not only in the long - wave limit ) , at least qualitatively .",
    "the best among the initial approximations considered so far is the regularized burnett approximation ( [ initial101 ] ) .",
    "we have already commented on the relation of this approximation to the invariance equations , as well as on its relation to the chapman - enskog procedure .",
    "the further important observation is as follows :    let us choose the _ euler _ approximation for the functions @xmath107 and @xmath108 , that is : @xmath325 the equation of the first newton iteration ( [ niteration101 ] ) is very simple : @xmath326 and @xmath327    thus , _ the regularized burnett approximation is at the same time the first newton correction as applied to the euler initial approximation_. this propertie distinguishes the regularization of the burnett approximation among other regularizations .",
    "now the functions ( [ 1nreg1101 ] ) can be regarded as the _ second _ newton correction as applied to the euler initial approximation ( [ euler101 ] ) .",
    "finally , let us examine the question what does the newton method do in a case of singularities . as we have demonstrated in the previous section ,",
    "the singularity of the diffusion - like mode occurs when this mode couples to a non - hydrodynamic mode of the 10 moment grad system if the spatial dimension is greater that one .",
    "we leave it here without a proof that the invariance equation method as applied to the 10 moment grad system ( [ grad103 ] ) leads to the system of equations ( [ system103 ] ) .",
    "we have already demonstrated what is the outcome of the newton method as applied to the first two equations of this system ( responsible for the acoustic mode and containing no singularities ) .",
    "the newton method , as applied to the equation ( [ quadratic103 ] ) , reads : @xmath328 where @xmath96 , and @xmath329 is a chosen initial approximation . taking the euler approximation ( @xmath330 ) ,",
    "we derive : @xmath331 the second approximation , @xmath332 , is singular at the point @xmath333 , and it can be demonstrated that all the further corrections do also have the first singularity at points @xmath334 , while the sequence @xmath335 tends to the actual branching point of the invariance equation ( [ quadratic103 ] ) @xmath336 .",
    "the analysis of further corrections demonstrates that the convergence is very rapid ( see fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) .",
    "the approximations ( [ y12 ] ) demonstrate that unlike the polynomial approximations , the newton method is sensitive to detect the actual singularities of the hydrodynamic spectrum . formally , the function @xmath332 becomes positive as @xmath86 becomes larger than @xmath337 , and thus attenuation rate , @xmath338 becomes positive after this point .",
    "however , unlike the super - burnett approximation for the acoustic mode , this transition occurs now in a singular point .",
    "indeed , the attenuation rate @xmath332 tends to `` minus infinity '' , as @xmath86 tends to @xmath337 from the left .",
    "thus , as described with the newton procedure , the non - physical domain is separated from the physical one with an `` infinitely viscid '' threshold .",
    "the occurrence of the poles in the newton iterations is , of course , quite clear .",
    "indeed , the newton method involves the derivative of the function @xmath339 which appears on the left hand side of the equation ( [ quadratic103 ] ) .",
    "the derivative @xmath340 becomes zero in the singularity point @xmath341 .",
    "the results of this section bring us to the following discussion :    \\(i ) the result of the exact summation of the chapman - enskog procedure brings us to the same system of equations as the principle of the dynamic invariance .",
    "this is demonstrated above for a specific situation but it holds as well for any ( linearized ) grad system .",
    "the resulting equations are always _ nonlinear _ ( even for the simplest linearized kinetic systems , such as grad equations ) .",
    "\\(ii ) now we are able to _ alter the viewpoint _ : the set of the invariance equations can be considered as the basic in the theory , while the chapman - enskog method is a way to solve it via an expansion in powers of @xmath86 .",
    "the method of power series expansion is neither the only method to solve equations , nor the optimal .",
    "alternative iteration methods might be better suited to the problem of constructing the reduced description .",
    "\\(iii ) an opportunity to derive the invariance equation in a closed form , and next to solve it this or that way , is , of course , rather exotic .",
    "the situation becomes complicated already for the nonlinear grad equations , and we should not expect anything simple in the case of the boltzmann equation",
    ". therefore , if we are willing to proceed along these lines in other problems , the attention draws towards the approximate procedures . with this , the question appears : what amount of information is required to execute the procedures ?",
    "indeed , the navier ",
    "stokes approximation can be obtained without any knowledge of the whole nonlinear system of invariance equations .",
    "it is important that the newton method , as applied to our problem , does not require any global information as well .",
    "this was demonstrated above by a relation between the first iteration as applied to the euler approximation and the regularization of the burnett approximation .",
    "let us consider as the next example the problem of the reduced description for the one - dimensional thirteen moment grad system .",

    "that is , we have to express the functions @xmath305 and @xmath347 in terms of @xmath350 , @xmath345 , and @xmath346 : @xmath351 the chapman - enskog method , as applied for this purpose , results in the following algebraic scheme ( we omit the knudsen number @xmath0 ) : @xmath352 where the chapman - enskog operators act as follows : @xmath353 the initial condition for the recurrence procedure ( [ procedure131 ] ) reads : @xmath354 , and @xmath355 , which leads to the navier - stokes - fourier hydrodynamic equations .",
    "computing the coefficients @xmath356 and @xmath357 , we come to the burnett approximation : @xmath358 the burnett approximation ( [ burnett131 ] ) coincides with that obtained from the boltzmann equation , and it is precisely the case where the instability was first demonstrated in the paper @xcite .    the structure of the terms @xmath359 and @xmath360 ( an analog of the equations ( [ structure101 ] ) and ( [ structure103 ] ) ) is as follows : @xmath361    a derivation of the invariance equation for the system ( [ grad131 ] ) goes along the same lines as in the previous section .",
    "we seek the functions of the reduced description in the form : @xmath362 where the functions @xmath363 are a subject of a further analysis .",

    "we derive : @xmath366 on the other hand , computing the macroscopic time derivative due to the first three equations of the system ( [ grad131 ] ) , we obtain : @xmath367 equating the corresponding expressions in the formulas ( [ micro131 ] ) and ( [ macro131 ] ) , we come to the following system of coupled equations : @xmath368 as above , the invariance equations ( [ invariance131 ] ) can be also obtained upon the summation of the chapman - enskog expansion , after the chapman - enskog procedure is casted into a recurrence relations for the coefficients @xmath369 ( [ structure131 ] ) .",
    "this route is less straightforward than the one just presented , and we omit the proof .",
    "the newton method , as applied to the system ( [ invariance131 ] ) , results in the following algorithm :    denote as the six - component vector function @xmath370 .",
    "let @xmath371 is the initial approximation , then : @xmath372 where @xmath96 , and the vector function @xmath373 is a solution to the linear system of equations : @xmath374 here @xmath375 is the vector function with the components @xmath376 , and @xmath377 is a @xmath378 matrix :    @xmath379    the euler approximation gives : @xmath380 , while @xmath381 , @xmath382 , and @xmath383 .",
    "the first newton iteration ( [ iteration131 ] ) as applied to this initial approximation , leads again to a simple algebraic problem , and we have finally obtained : @xmath384    substituting the expression ( [ structure131 ] ) into the first three equations of the grad system ( [ grad131 ] ) , and proceeding to the dispersion relation as above , we derive the latter in terms of the functions @xmath385 : @xmath386    when the functions @xmath387 ( [ 1n131 ] ) are substituted instead of @xmath385 into the equation ( [ dispersion131 ] ) , the dispersion relation of the first newton iteration , as applied to the invariance equations ( [ invariance131 ] ) with the euler initial approximation , is obtained .",
    "this result coincides with the regularization of the burnett approximation , which was considered in @xcite .",
    "there it was demonstrate that the equilibrium is stable within this approximation for arbitrary wave lengths .",
    "the dispersion relation for the burnett approximation , in turn , is due to the approximation @xmath388 as it follows from a comparison of the expressions ( [ burnett131 ] ) and ( [ form131 ] ) .",
    "the dispersion relation for the burnett approximation coincides with the one obtained in @xcite from the boltzmann equation .",
    "the final example to be considered is the 13 moment grad system in the full spatial dimension , ( [ balanceequations ] ) and ( [ grad133 ] ) .",
    "let us rewrite here the original system in terms of fourier variables : @xmath389 here we have represented the wave vector as @xmath390 , and @xmath391 is the unit vector .",

    "simple but rather extensive computations in this case lead , of course , to the invariance equations ( [ invariance133 - 1 ] ) and ( [ invariance133 - 2 ] ) .    the newton method , as applied to the systems ( [ invariance133 - 1 ] ) and ( [ invariance133 - 2 ] ) with the initial euler approximation , leads in the first iteration to the regularization of the burnett approximation reported earlier in @xcite .    introducing the functions @xmath401 and @xmath402 , we come in the equation ( [ invariance133 - 2 ] ) to the following : @xmath403 while @xmath404 the derivative , @xmath405 , becomes equal to zero in the point @xmath406 , which gives the critical wave vector @xmath407 .",

    "the non - hydrodynamic mode which couples to the extended diffusion mode is associated with the longitudinal phonons , and is the case ( [ dispersioni1 ] ) .",
    "the case ( [ dispersioni2 ] ) is due to the transverse phonons . in the nondegenerate cases ,",
    "( [ dispersionii ] ) and ( [ dispersioniii ] ) , the both pairs of modes become propagating after certain critical values of @xmath86 , and the behavior of the extended diffusion mode is influenced by all the three non - hydrodynamic modes just mentioned .",
    "it should be stressed , however , that second sound mode which is the continuation of the diffusion mode @xcite , is due to the eq .",
    "( [ dispersioni1 ] ) .",
    "the results of the above analysis lead to the following discussion :    \\(i ) the examples considered above indicate an interesting mechanism of a _ kinetic _ formation of the second sound regime from the extended diffusion with the participation of the non - hydrodynamic mode .",
    "the onset of the propagating mode shows up as the critical point of the extension of the hydrodynamic solution into the domain of finite @xmath86 , which was found within the chapman ",
    "enskog and equivalent approaches .",
    "this results concern the situation at the high - temperature edge of the guyer  krumhansl window , and are complementary to the coupling between the transversal ballistic mode and second sound at the low - temperature edge @xcite .",
    "\\(ii ) the crossover from the diffusion - like to the wave - like propagation was previously found in @xcite in frames of exact chapman - enskog solution to the boltzmann equation for the lorentz gas model @xcite , and for similar models of phonon scattering in anisotropic disordered media @xcite .",
    "the characteristic common feature of the models studied in @xcite and the models @xcite is the existence of a gap between the hydrodynamic ( diffusive ) and the non - hydrodynamic components of the spectrum .",
    "therefore , one can expect that the destruction of the extended diffusion is solely due to the _ existence _ of this gap . in applications to the phonon kinetic theory this amounts to the introduction of the relaxation time approximation .",
    "in other words , we may expect that the mechanism of crossover from diffusion to second sound in the simple models @xcite is identical to what could be found from the phonon  boltzmann kinetic equation within the relaxation time approximation .",
    "however , a remark is in order since the original ( i.  e. , without the relaxation time approximation ) phonon kinetic equations are _ gapless _ ( cf . , e.  g. , @xcite ) . on the other hand , most of the works on heat propagation in solids _",
    "do _ explore the idea of the gap , since it is only possible to speak of the diffusion if such a gap exists . to conclude this point ,",
    "the following general hypothesis can be expressed : _ the existence of the diffusion ( and hence of the gap in the relaxational spectrum ) leads to its destruction through the coupling to a non - hydrodynamic mode . _      in the preceding sections , the chapman - enskog and other methods were probed explicitly for the linearized grad equations far beyond the usual navier  stokes approximation .",
    "this was possible , first of all , because the problem of the reduced description was shaped into a rather simple _ algebraic _ form .",
    "indeed , the algebraic structure of the stress tensor @xmath533 and of the heat flux @xmath534 was fairly simple . however , when we attempt to extend the approach onto the nonlinear grad equations , the algebraic structure of the problem is no longer simple .",
    "indeed , when we proceed along the lines of the chapman - enskog method , for example , the number of _ types _ of terms , @xmath535 , @xmath536 , @xmath537 , @xmath538 , and so on , in the chapman - enskog coefficients @xmath165 and @xmath539 demonstrates the combinatorial growth with the order @xmath55 .    still , a progress is possible if we impose some rules of selection of relevant terms . as applied to the chapman - enskog expansion , these selection rules prescribe to keep only the contributions coming from the terms with a definite structure in each order @xmath165 and @xmath539 , and to ignore all other terms .",
    "this approach can be linked again with the partial summation rules for the perturbation series in many - body theories , where usually terms with a definite structure are summed instead of a series in a whole .",
    "our viewpoint on the problem of extension of the hydrodynamics in the nonlinear case can be expressed as follows : the exact extension seems to be impossible , and , moreover , quite useless because of the lack of a physical transparency . instead , certain sub - series of the chapman - enskog expansion , selected on clear physical grounds , may lead to less complicated equations , which , at the same time , provide an extension of a certain subclass of hydrodynamic phenomena .",
    "this viewpoint is illustrated in this section by considering a sub - series of the chapman - enskog expansion which gives the dominating contribution when the flow velocity becomes very large ( and thus it is relevant to a high - speed subclass of hydrodynamic phenomena such as strong shock waves ) .",
    "the approach to the chapman - enskog series for the nonlinear grad equations just mentioned , and which was based on a diagrammatic representation of the chapman - enskog method , has been attempted earlier in @xcite . in this section , however , we will take the route of the dynamic invariance equations which leads to the same results more directly .",
    "the starting point is the set of one - dimensional nonlinear grad equations for the hydrodynamic variables @xmath540 , @xmath61 and @xmath541 , coupled to the non - hydrodynamic variable @xmath62 , where @xmath62 is the @xmath63-component of the stress tensor :    @xmath542    here @xmath13 is the temperature - dependent viscosity coefficient .",
    "we will adopt the form @xmath543 , which is characteristic to the point - center models of particle s collisions , where @xmath544 varies from @xmath545 ( maxwellian molecules ) to @xmath546 ( hard spheres ) , and where @xmath547 is a dimensional factor .    even in this model",
    ", the chapman - enskog expansion appears to be exceedingly complicated in the full setting .",
    "therefore , we address another , more restrictive problem : _ what is the leading correction to the navier  stokes approximation when the characteristic value of the average velocity is comparable to the thermal velocity ? _    our goal is to compute the correction to the navier - stokes closure relation , @xmath548 , for high values of the average velocity .",
    "let us consider first the burnett correction as from the eq .",
    "( [ gradnl ] ) : @xmath549 the correction of the desired type is given by the nonlinear term proportional to @xmath550 .",
    "each further @xmath55th term of the chapman - enskog expansion contributes , among others , the nonlinear term proportional to @xmath551 .",
    "such terms can be named _",
    "high - speed _ terms since they dominate the rest of the contributions in each order of the chapman - enskog expansion when the characteristic average velocity is comparable to the heat velocity . indeed , if @xmath552 is a characteristic mean velocity , and @xmath553 , where @xmath554 is dimensionless , then the term @xmath551 receives the factor @xmath555 which is the highest possible order of @xmath552 among the terms available in the @xmath55th order of the chapman - enskog expansion .",
    "simple dimensional analysis leads to a conclusion that such terms are of the form @xmath556 , where @xmath557 is dimensionless .",
    "therefore , the chapman - enskog expansion for the function @xmath62 may be formally rewritten as : @xmath558 the series in the brackets is the collection of the high - speed contributions of interest , coming from _ all _ the orders of the chapman - enskog expansion , while the dots outside the brackets stand for the terms of other nature .",
    "thus , the high - speed correction to the navier  stokes closure relation in frames of the grad equations ( [ gradnl ] ) takes the form : @xmath559 where @xmath560 is the function represented by a formal subsequence of chapman - enskog terms in the expansion ( [ representation ] ) .",
    "the function @xmath228 can be viewed also as a dynamic modification of the viscosity @xmath561 due to the gradient of the average velocity .",
    "we will now turn to the problem of an explicit derivation of the function @xmath228 ( [ r ] ) . following the principle of dynamic invariance , we , first , compute the microscopic derivative of the function @xmath562 by substituting the expression ( [ r ] ) into the right hand side of the eq .",
    "( [ gd ] ) : @xmath563 where dots denote the terms irrelevant to the closure relation ( [ r ] ) ( such terms appear , of course , because ( [ r ] ) is not the exact closure relation ) .",

    "this correction has the form @xmath580 , where @xmath581 is the longitudinal rate .",
    "the viscosity factor @xmath560 is a solution to the differential equation ( [ invariance ] ) , subject to a certain initial condition .",
    "uribe and pia @xcite have indicated some interesting features of the invariance equation ( [ invariance ] ) for the model of hard spheres . in particular , they have found that a numerical integration from the initial point into the domain of negative longitudinal rates is very difficult .",

    "this solution can be constructed , for example , with the taylor expansion , and which is identical with the relevant sub ",
    "series of the chapman ",
    "enskog expansion .",
    "however , the difficulty in constructing this solution numerically for @xmath585 originates from the fact that the same point @xmath586 is the point of _ essential singularity _ of other ( irrelevant ) solutions to the eq .",

    "let us consider @xmath588 , where @xmath589 is the relevant solution for small @xmath590 , and @xmath591 is a deviation .",

    "it provides a reasonable global approximation to the attractor for both positive and negative @xmath568 .",
    "we conclude with a discussion .",
    "\\(i ) the main feature of the above example of extending the hydrodynamic description into a highly non - equilibrium and nonlinear domain can be expressed as follows : this is an _ exact partial summation _ of the chapman - enskog expansion .",
    "`` partial '' means that the relevant high - speed terms , dominating the other contributions in the limit of the high average velocity , were accounted to all the orders of the original chapman - enskog expansion .",
    "`` exact '' means that , though we have used the formally different route , the result is indeed the sum of the relevant sub - series of the original chapman - enskog expansion . in other words , if we now expand the function @xmath620 ( [ viscosity ] ) in powers of @xmath568 , in the point @xmath573 , we come back to the corresponding series inside the brackets in the eq .",
    "( [ representation ] ) . that this is indeed true can be checked up to the few lower orders straightforwardly , though the complete proof requires a more involved analysis , and will be reported elsewhere . as the final comment to this point",
    ", we would like to stress a certain similarity between the problem considered above and the frequent situations in many - body problems : there is no a single leading _ term _ but instead there is the leading _ sub - series _ of the perturbation expansions , under certain conditions .",
    "\\(ii ) let us discuss briefly the features of the resulting hydrodynamics .",
    "the hydrodynamic equations are now given by eqs .",
    "( [ ga ] ) , ( [ gb ] ) , and ( [ gc ] ) , where @xmath62 is replaced with @xmath562 ( [ r ] ) .",
    "first , the correction concerns the nonlinear regime , and thus the linearized form of new equations coincides with the linearized navier  stokes equations .",
    "second , the solution ( [ viscosity ] ) for the maxwellian molecules and the result of approximation ( [ approximation ] ) for other models suggests that the modified viscosity @xmath621 gives a vanishing contribution in the limit of very high values of the average velocity .",
    "this feature seems to be of no surprise : if the average velocity is very high in comparison to other characteristic velocities ( in our case , to the heat velocity ) , no mechanisms of momentum transfer are relevant except for the transfer with the stream . however , a cautious remark is in order since the original `` kinetic '' description are grad equations ( [ gradnl ] ) and not the boltzmann equation .",
    "\\(iii ) the invariance equation ( [ invariance ] ) defines the relevant physical solution to the viscosity factor for all values of @xmath568 , and demonstrates an interesting phase - space behavior similar to those of finite - dimensional dynamical systems .",
    "up to now , the problem of the exact relationship between kinetics and hydrodynamics remains unsolved .",
    "all the methods used to establish this relationship are not rigorous , and involve approximations . in this work , we have considered situations where hydrodynamics is the exact consequence of kinetics , and in that respect , a new class of exactly solvable models of statistical physics has been established .",
    "the main lesson we can learn from the exact solution is the following : the chapman - enskog method is the taylor series expansion approach to solving the appropriate invariance equation .",
    "alternative iteration methods are much more robust for solving this equation .",
    "therefore , it seems quite important to develop approaches to the problem of reduced description based on the principle of dynamic invariance rather than on particular methods of solving the invariance equations .",
    "the exact solutions where these questions can be answered in all the quantitative details provide a sound motivation for such developments .",
    "interested reader is directed to the paper @xcite where a general formulation of the reduced description from the standpoint of constructing invariant manifolds has been developed , as well as to some recent applications in the problems of boltzmann kinetic theory , chemical kinetics , and polymer kinetic theory are given @xcite .",
