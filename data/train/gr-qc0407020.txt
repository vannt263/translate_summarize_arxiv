    "in recent years , many efforts have been devoted to formulate a local geometrical criterion which could indicate chaotic behavior in a mechanical system .",
    "the main idea behind such attempts is to provide the lagrangian or hamiltonian formulation of the equations of motion with an effective riemaniann structure , and then search for some criterion based on its curvature properties which could predict local instabilities that might lead to chaos@xcite .",
    "this line of research has been mainly inspired by the celebrated result due to anosov@xcite stating that the geodesic flow is chaotic in compact manifolds for which all sectional curvatures are everywhere negative .    in a recent work ,",
    "zsczsny and dobrowolski@xcite rederive in a straightforward way the relevant results necessary to formulate such criteria .",
    "we adopt here their conventions , which we will briefly recall now .",
    "let us consider a classical mechanical system with @xmath0 degrees of freedom described by the lagrangian [ lagr ] l(q , ) = g_ij(q)^i ^j - v(q ) , where @xmath1 , the dot stands to differentiation with respect to the time @xmath2 , and @xmath3 is the riemannian metric on the configuration space @xmath4 .",
    "all the quantities here are assumed to be sufficiently smooth .",
    "the euler - lagrange equations of ( [ lagr ] ) can be written as [ el ] ^i + ^i_jk ^j ^k = - g^ij_j v(q ) , where @xmath5 is the levi - civita connection for the metric @xmath3 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system described by ( [ lagr ] ) [ ham ] h(q , p ) = g^ij(q)p_i p_j + v(q ) , with @xmath6 , is obviously a constant of motion , namely the total energy . for a fixed energy @xmath7",
    ", the trajectories in the phase - space are confined to the hypersurface @xmath8 the admissible region for the trajectories in the configuration space is , therefore , given by _",
    "e = \\{q : v(q ) e } . in general , the region @xmath9 can be bounded or not , connected or not .",
    "the boundary of the admissible region for the trajectories is given by _",
    "e = \\{q : v(q ) = e } .",
    "if the potential has no critical points on the boundary @xmath10 , then @xmath11 is a ( @xmath12)-dimensional submanifold of @xmath4 .",
    "we can easily see that if a trajectory reaches the boundary @xmath11 at a point @xmath13 , its velocity at this point vanishes and the trajectory approach or depart from @xmath13 perpendicularly to the boundary @xmath11 .",
    "in particular , there is no allowed trajectory along the boundary .",
    "the crucial observation here is that the equations of motion ( [ el ] ) are , in the interior of @xmath9 , fully equivalent to the geodesic equation in the `` effective '' riemannian geometry on @xmath4 defined by the jacobi metric@xcite [ jacobi ] _",
    "ij(q ) = 2(e - v(q ) ) g_ij(q ) . the geodesic equation for the effective geometry defined from ( [ jacobi ] )",
    "is given by [ geo ] _",
    "u u = + ^i_jk = 0 , where @xmath14 is the tangent vector along the geodesic , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are , respectively , the covariant derivative and the levi - civita connection for the jacobi metric @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is a parameter along the geodesic obeying [ para ] = 2 ( e - v(q ) ) .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath19 is a monotonically increasing function of time in the interior of @xmath9@xcite . however , from ( [ para ] ) we can see that @xmath18 is not a good evolution parameter on the boundary , since @xmath20 on @xmath21 . as we will see , it is namely this failure , on the boundary @xmath21 , of the equivalence between the equation of motion ( [ el ] ) and the geodesic equation in the effective riemannian manifold ( [ geo ] ) that precludes the possibility of obtaining an efficacious local , curvature - based criterion to predict chaotic behavior of the system governed by ( [ el ] ) .    in a riemannian geometry , the local tendency of geodesics to converge or to diverge",
    "is governed by the geodesic deviation equation : [ gde ] _ u _ u n = ( u , n)u , where @xmath22 is the riemannian curvature of the jacobi metric ( [ jacobi ] ) . the vector field @xmath23 , called geodesic deviation , is orthogonal to @xmath24 and measures the distance between nearby geodesics . for two - dimensional systems , one can choose fermi frames @xmath25 such that @xmath26 and @xmath27 , and the geodesic deviation equation takes the simple form@xcite [ gde1 ] = - x , where @xmath28 is the gaussian curvature of the two - dimensional jacobi metric ( [ jacobi ] ) , which is given by = k + + , where @xmath29 is the gaussian curvature of the original two - dimensional configuration space @xmath4 .",
    "the laplacian @xmath30 and the quadratic term @xmath31 are defined with respect to the configuration space metric @xmath3 .",
    "note that , with the hypothesis that the potential is smooth ( @xmath30 is finite ) and has no critical points ( @xmath32 ) on @xmath21 , the effective gaussian curvature @xmath28 diverges on the boundary .",
    "moreover , since @xmath33 inside @xmath34 , @xmath28 always assume arbitrary large positive values near the boundary .",
    "it is clear from ( [ gde1 ] ) that when the gaussian curvature is positive the geodesics converge locally . on the other hand , if it is negative , one has the local divergence of nearby geodesics .",
    "zsczsny and dobrowolski illustrated the case of positive gaussian curvature @xmath28 with three known integrable 2-dimensional systems : quadratic potentials , the toda lattice and the bounded kepler problem .",
    "if the admissible region for the trajectories on the configuration space has no boundary , the equivalence between ( [ el ] ) and ( [ geo ] ) is complete .",
    "if , besides , all sectional curvatures are everywhere negative , close trajectories governed by ( [ el ] ) tend to diverge at every point .",
    "however , even in such case , it does not mean that the system is chaotic , as zsczsny and dobrowolski have shown with their unbounded kepler problem example .",
    "the key requirement of compactness is lacking here to reproduce the result of anosov .",
    "it is quite easy , indeed , to generate integrable models with effective gaussian curvature everywhere negative on a non - compact @xmath34 by exploring harmonic potentials in higher dimensions@xcite .",
    "the local divergence of nearby trajectories is not , therefore , a sufficient condition to the occurrence of chaos .    in this work ,",
    "we question again the viability of such local criteria by showing , by means of an explicit example , that they are neither necessary to the occurrence of chaos . in the next section",
    ", we will introduce a two - dimensional system with the gaussian curvature @xmath28 everywhere positive in the interior of @xmath9 , and , hence , locally stable .",
    "as we will see , chaotic behavior is indeed ruled out for large sets of trajectories reaching the boundary @xmath21 .",
    "however , we identify a set of trajectories that reach a non convex part of the boundary and give rise to chaotic motion .",
    "the situation here is similar to case of classical billiards@xcite .",
    "segments of trajectories between two successive bounces on the boundary @xmath21 are integrable , but the smooth match of an infinite number of some of these segments give rises to a chaotic trajectory . as ,",
    "in general , we can not decide a priori if a given trajectory does or does not reach the non convex part of boundary for some @xmath35 , the positivity of @xmath28 inside @xmath9 is useless to predict if such trajectory is regular or not .",
    "we notice that the potential problems with the interpretation of the true motion governed by ( [ el ] ) as a geodesic equation in an effective riemannian manifold with boundary were already pointed out in @xcite . some suggestions to avoid them based on distinct differential spaces instead of differential manifolds were proposed in @xcite .",
    "we also notice that the power of local criteria to predict chaos in general relativity has also been questioned .",
    "vieira and letelier@xcite , for instance , showed that the local criterion based on the eigenvalues of the weyl curvature tensor presented by sota , suzuki and maeda@xcite were neither necessary nor sufficient for the prediction of chaos in vacuum static axisymmetric spacetimes .    despite the fact that such curvature - based criteria are neither necessary nor sufficient to the occurrence of chaos , the analysis of the geodesic deviation equation for the jacobi metric has proved to be valuable in some cases . for instance , in @xcite , some chaotic behavior , confirmed by the numerical evaluation of lyapunov exponents , is identified in a newtonian gravitational problem with negative effective gaussian curvature . in @xcite ,",
    "chaotic mixing behavior in thermal - equilibrium beams , confirmed also by some numerical calculations , is again identified in regions with negative gaussian curvature . in the other hand , regions of regular motion in the anisotropic manev problem@xcite and the yang - mills - higgs@xcite system",
    "coincide with positive gaussian curvature regions .",
    "we emphasize , however , that since the criteria based on the geodesic deviation equation are neither necessary nor sufficient for the occurrence of chaos , they must be used merely as _ preliminary indicators _ of integrability or chaos in dynamical systems .",
    "our model is quite simple .",
    "it consists in a point - like particle moving under the potential corresponding the superposition of a quadratic attractive potential and some two - dimensional harmonic repulsive monopoles .",
    "the configuration space @xmath4 is locally just @xmath36 with the euclidean metric .",
    "let us consider explicitly the simplest case with only one repulsive monopole with charge @xmath37 , placed at a distance @xmath38 from the center of the quadratic potential .",
    "the particle motion is governed by the hamiltonian @xmath39 , with [ vv ] v(x , y ) = k + k - ( ) the parameter @xmath40 has no dynamical consequences , it is chosen in order to guarantee that the minimum of @xmath41 be zero .",
    "clearly , in the limit @xmath42 we have a central - force integrable model .",
    "the equations of motion are very simple . by introducing some dimensionless quantities ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 )",
    ", one has @xmath46 where @xmath47 .",
    "= 7.0 cm = 7.0 cm    we have two kinds of admissible regions for the trajectories . for @xmath48 , where e_c = + , with @xmath49 ,",
    "@xmath9 is simply - connected , in contrast with the case for @xmath50 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . in both cases",
    ", @xmath41 is smooth in @xmath9 and has no critical points on @xmath21 .    in the interior of @xmath9 , the gaussian curvature @xmath28 for this system , = + ,",
    "is everywhere positive .",
    "therefore , the nearby trajectories of our model approach each other at all points of the interior of @xmath9 .",
    "as expected , the gaussian curvature diverges on the boundary .",
    "in order to study the phase space of our system , we solve numerically the system governed by ( [ ham1 ] ) and construct poincar s sections by using henon s trick@xcite .",
    "we could do it very accurately , with a cumulative error , measured by the constant hamiltonian @xmath51 , inferior to @xmath52 .",
    "our results are shown in the next figures .    in fig .",
    "( 2 ) , we have a typical poincare s section across the plane @xmath53 for the the simply - connected @xmath9 case .",
    "the regular solutions correspond to trajectories that do not probe the non convex part of the boundary , see fig .",
    "( 3 ) . despite our exhaustive simulations",
    ", we could not find a single trajectory that never touches the boundary @xmath54 .",
    "we were not able to prove analytically the absence of such trajectories , but we notice that the argument used in @xcite to prove the existence of them does not hold here .",
    "+    the behavior of the chaotic trajectories bouncing on the non convex part of the boundary resemble classical billiards@xcite .",
    "two close trajectories reaching a convex part of the boundary are bounced in a `` focusing '' way , while the non convex part defocuses nearby bouncing trajectories , causing the divergence of the associate geodesics , in spite of the positive gaussian curvature @xmath28 .",
    "similar results hold for the multiply - connected @xmath9 case , see fig .",
    "the chaotic motion corresponds to the trajectories that reach the non convex part of the boundary , including its internal part ( fig .",
    "the trajectories that are restricted to convex parts of the boundary are regular .     +    the dependency of our results on @xmath55 shows no surprises .",
    "the smaller is the parameter @xmath55 , the close to @xmath56 we have the onset of chaos . for a given @xmath55 ,",
    "the value of @xmath57 marking the onset of chaos can be predicted analytically .",
    "since the chaotic motions arise from the bouncing on the non convex part of the boundary , the onset of chaos will be determined by the appearance of the non convex region , which , as one can easily see , is related to the intersections of the curves @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "these curves have two intersections in the non convex case , and no intersections in the convex one .",
    "the value of @xmath7 corresponding to only one intersection marks the transition .",
    "the situation for the case of two or more monopoles is similar to the expounded here .",
    "chaotic behavior always appears for the trajectories that probe the non convex part of @xmath60 , including the internal parts of the boundary for the multiply - connected case .",
    "we have shown that the local stability criterion based on the geodesic deviation equation for the jacobi metric is neither necessary nor sufficient to the occurrence of chaos . for this purpose",
    ", we introduce a class of 2-dimensional systems exhibiting chaotic behavior , confirmed by numerical evaluation of poincar sections , with everywhere positive gaussian curvature , and thus locally stable .",
    "the chaotic behavior arises for certain trajectories bouncing on non convex parts of the boundary of the effective riemannian manifold , resembling the behavior of some classical billiards@xcite . despite the fact that the positivity of the gaussian curvature @xmath28 ensures the convergence of nearby geodesics ,",
    "chaotic behavior can arise due to defocusing of geodesics bouncing on non convex parts of the boundary @xmath54 .",
