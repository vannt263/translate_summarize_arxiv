    "supernovae ( sne)-driven winds , and in particular their role in setting the timescale for the cessation of bulk star formation , have long been recognised as important components of elliptical galaxy formation / evolution models .",
    "such wind models provide a natural framework in which the intrinsic elliptical galaxy colour - metallicity - luminosity ( cml ) relationships can be established ( larson 1974 ; arimoto & yoshii 1987 ; gibson 1996a , b ) . an inescapable consequence of such sne - driven winds is the enrichment of the intergalactic medium with the products of sne nucleosynthesis ( larson & dinerstein 1975 ) .",
    "such wind `` pollution '' is particularly evident in the hot intracluster medium ( icm ) of elliptical - rich galaxy clusters .",
    "early , type ii sne - dominated winds are the favoured mechanism at play here , as evidenced by the strong @xmath2-element enhancement signatures in this hot gas ( @xmath3  mushotzky 1996 ) .",
    "the absolute mass of iron in a cluster s icm can be shown to be related to the host cluster s integrated v - band luminosity tied up in ellipticals ; @xmath4 where the mass and luminosity are in solar units ( arnaud 1994 ) .",
    "similarly , a cluster s icm gas mass @xmath5 can be related to its early - type galaxy v - band luminosity by @xmath6 with loose groups and rich clusters populating the low and high luminosity extrema , respectively . while important ,- element overabundance signature , late - time type ia sne - driven wind models are no longer a viable _ dominant icm - pollution mechanism .",
    "_ ] these icm constraints do not , by themselves , provide much information on the underlying star formation or initial mass function ( imf ) formalisms .",
    "previous papers in this series ( matteucci & gibson 1995 ; gibson & matteucci 1997 ) have adopted the classic _ closed - box model for a galaxy s evolution and concluded that imfs significantly flatter - than - salpeter s ( 1955 ) canonical power - law slope @xmath7 are required , in order to fit the icm constraints noted above .",
    "similar conclusions have been drawn by david , forman & jones ( 1991 ) zepf & silk ( 1996 ) and loewenstein & mushotzky ( 1996 ) . _    in the past year though , interest has been piqued by the adoption of gas _ infall models for ellipticals ( tantalo 1996 ; kodama & arimoto 1997 ) , in lieu of the aforementioned closed - box scenarios .",
    "such studies retain the sne - driven wind framework but consciously restrict themselves to the spectrophotometric properties of their model galaxies , neglecting the consequences for enriching the icm . because there exists a level of degeneracy in the present - day cml relationships , due to uncertainties in the imf ( table 8 of gibson 1997 ) , star formation methodology , sne energetics , etc , tantalo and kodama & arimoto used , partially for convenience , imf power law slopes close to the salpeter ( 1955 ) value  the former , @xmath7 ; the latter , @xmath8 .",
    "_    the time is now ripe to assess the infall model in light of the heretofore neglected icm constraints  in particular , the abundance ratios and absolute gas masses  in order to better appreciate its strengths and weaknesses .",
    "what follows represents the first application of gas infall models to the icm constraints , with answering the question  _ in the presence of gas infall , is the imf in cluster ellipticals dominated by high - mass stars ( top - heavy ) , or does it follow the more canonical salpeter distribution ?  being the highest priority . _    to this end , in section [ compare ] we remind the reader of the primary motivation for considering the infall model in the first place . following this , in section [ analysis ] , we present a grid of models which parallels that of kodama & arimoto ( 1997 ) .",
    "we follow their numerical formalism , for convenience sake , although its similarity to that of tantalo s ( 1996 ) means our conclusions are independent of this choice .",
    "as we will show , the favoured kodama & arimoto grid , with imf slope @xmath9 , underproduces icm iron by approximately a factor of five .",
    "we next present an alternate grid of infall models consistent with the icm abundance constraints . as discussed in section",
    "[ analysis ] , consistent with the results of earlier closed - box models , only imf slopes significantly flatter - then - salpeter ( @xmath10 ) were capable of recovering the galaxy cml relations _ and the icm abundance constraints , albeit at the expense of the icm gas mass constraint .",
    "our results are summarised in section [ summary ] . _",
    "recall that our earlier papers ( matteucci & gibson 1995 ; gibson & matteucci 1997 ) adopted the straightforward closed - box model for galaxy evolution .",
    "in particular , the star formation rate @xmath11 was assumed to vary directly with the gas mass , as @xmath12 with the timescale for star formation @xmath13 varying in such a way that the present - day cml relations were properly established . in the closed - box model ,",
    "star formation is a maximum at @xmath14 , steadily decreasing thereafter .",
    "gibson & matteucci ( 1997 ) showed that one can successfully recover the [ ( v - k),l@xmath15 relation for ellipticals , and still honour all of the icm abundance constraints , within the closed - box model framework , _ but only for imf slopes significantly flatter - than - salpeter s ( 1955 )  a slope @xmath16 , as opposed to salpeter s",
    "canonical @xmath7 , was necessary .",
    "_    it has since become apparent ( tantalo 1996 ; kodama & arimoto 1997 ) though that this same closed - box model for ellipticals does not appear to have the same success in recovering the _ ultraviolet ( uv)-optical cml relations , a point not explored in the gibson & matteucci ( 1997 ) study .",
    "the reason for this failure is the overproduction of low - metallicity ( z=0 ) stars during the initial intense star formation regime ; the signature of such a component is not seen in the integrated spectra of old stellar populations ( worthey , dorman & jones 1996 ) .",
    "_    several alternate star formation formalisms , aimed specifically at avoiding this low - metallicity overproduction , have since been published ",
    "the previously noted tantalo ( 1996 ) and kodama & arimoto ( 1997 ) studies being the most noteworthy .",
    "these infall models are similar in spirit to those designed to avoid the analogous g - dwarf problem encountered by solar neighbourhood - enrichment models ( tinsley 1980 ) , although for ellipticals , the infall timescales are , of course , substantially different to the slower accretion rates expected for spirals .",
    "following tantalo and kodama & arimoto , we adopt an infall rate which parallels the free - fall timescale .",
    "star formation , in both models , is assumed to follow equation [ eq : eqn3 ] , but instead , with an initial gas mass of zero , increasing in accordance with the assumed gas infall rate law .",
    "the accompanying rapid increase in global metallicity means that very few low - metallicity stars are formed , avoiding the g - dwarf problem .    in summary ,",
    "gas infall models for elliptical galaxies have been considered as viable alternatives to the classic closed - box model , primarily because they provide a simple solution to the overproduction of low metallicity stars which plagues the closed - box models - such a g - dwarf problem manifests itself most clearly in the closed - box model s problem in recovering the uv - optical cml relations .",
    "using the photo - chemical evolution code of gibson ( 1996a , b;1997 ) , we constructed a grid of seven elliptical galaxy models consistent with the `` metallicity sequence '' of kodama & arimoto ( 1997 , hereafter ka97 ) .",
    "in particular , ka97 adopted an imf slope mildly flatter ( @xmath8 ) than salpeter s ( 1955 ) @xmath7 , with a mass range of @xmath17 m@xmath18 . the cessation of star formation ( at time @xmath19 )",
    "was treated as a free parameter , and varied to ensure recovery of the present - day elliptical galaxy cml relations . mag .",
    "tracing the source of this discrepancy is not possible at this time , as their simple stellar population ( ssp ) colours are not currently available .",
    "our grid is based upon the published bertelli ( 1994 ) isochrones , with the low mass extensions outlined in gibson ( 1996a ) . for the alternate grid of models to be discussed shortly ,",
    "we ensure self - consistency by maintaining this systematic 0.06 magnitude offset in ( v - k ) . ]",
    "reasonable values for the parameters governing the timescales for star formation and gas infall were adopted ( 0.1 gyr ) , independent of galaxy model .",
    "the adopted nucleosynthetic yields are described in gibson & mould ( 1997 ) .",
    "the first block of models in table 1 represent our pseudo - ka97 grid ( those labelled @xmath8 ) ; unlike the data presented in their table 2 , to which the reader is referred to for additional parameters not relevant to the discussion at hand , we have included the masses of gas , oxygen , and iron ejected to the icm , for each model ( in units of @xmath20 m@xmath18 , @xmath21 m@xmath18 , and @xmath21 m@xmath18 , respectively )",
    ". the initial gas mass reservoir associated with each model ( @xmath22 , in units of @xmath20 m@xmath18 ) is also provided in column 2 , as it was not included in ka97 s table 2 .",

    "the new @xmath39 grid , which is now consistent with the icm constraint of equation [ eq : eqn1 ] , only exacerbates this shortcoming , being a _ further @xmath45 dex removed from the mean .",
    "second , and perhaps more importantly , the flatter imf grid requires an initial gas mass reservoir @xmath46 more massive than that for the steeper imf grid , for galactic models of the same present - day luminosity . _ _    following section 7 of elbaz ( 1995 ) , we then use the models of table 1 to find that the _ predicted icm gas mass to cluster luminosity is @xmath47 for the @xmath8 grid , and @xmath48 for the @xmath39 grid .",
    "this predicted icm gas mass includes the mass of gas ejected at @xmath19 ( column 4 of table 1 ) and the residual , unincorporated , reservoir gas ( column 7 ) .",
    "an additional component from late - time ( @xmath49 ) winds or ram pressure stripping can be included but does not alter the coefficients shown in equations [ eq : eqn4 ] and [ eq : eqn5 ] .",
    "the coefficients can be reduced by a factor of @xmath50 to recover the relation based upon the ejected gas mass at @xmath19 alone . _    for the @xmath8 imf , equation",
    "[ eq : eqn4 ] implies that @xmath51% ( loose groups to rich clusters ) of the total icm gas ( equation [ eq : eqn2 ] ) has been accounted for ; @xmath52% of this has been processed and ejected from cluster ellipticals , and @xmath53% is associated with residual reservoir - gas.% , as we have fit simple power - laws to the gas mass  cluster luminosity relations in order to follow the procedure laid out in section 7 of elbaz ( 1995 ) .",
    "strictly , a numerical integration should be performed , as discussed already in gibson & matteucci ( 1997 ) , but for simplicity s",
    "sake we adhere to the elbaz formalism . ]",
    "the remaining @xmath54% ( loose groups to rich clusters ) of the observed icm gas must therefore be assigned to some gas component which simply does not partake in the star formation process ( either `` actively '' through galactic wind ejection , or `` passively '' , by being associated with a specific galactic halo s initial gas reservoir ) .",
    "this is perfectly in keeping with the results of matteucci & vettolani ( 1988 ) , david ( 1991 ) , elbaz ( 1995 ) , and gibson & matteucci ( 1997 ) .    on the other hand , equation [ eq : eqn5 ] ,",
    "coupled with the @xmath39 grid , implies that @xmath55% ( again , loose groups to rich clusters ) of the total icm gas ( equation [ eq : eqn2 ] ) has been accounted for !",
    "again , this gas can be considered to be @xmath56% `` processed - and - ejected '' and @xmath56% `` initial gas reservoir - associated ''  no other cluster gas constituent need be invoked .",
    "the problem lies , of course , in that for any system `` poorer '' than the richest clusters , there is an accompanying overproduction of gas  _ the grid of infall models constructed with the most conservative input parameters require , and yield , more gas than is actually observed , for all but the richest clusters .",
    "some of this discrepancy may be alleviated if the galactic winds are successful in overcoming not only an individual galaxy s potential well , but that of the group s as well , dispersing some fraction of the `` excess '' gas to the general intergalactic medium .",
    "_      because of the closed - box model s failure to properly recover the uv - optical cml relations ( recall section [ compare ] ) and the infall model s problems with gas `` overproduction '' , it might be tempting , by process of elimination , to support the notion of time ( and position)-variable imfs , a l padoan , nordlund & jones ( 1997 ) .",
    "detailed models based upon padoan s `` universal '' imf formalism will be presented elsewhere , but we would be remiss if we did not at least temper such `` default '' support , by noting two of the weaknesses in the ( currently ) best available variable - imf elliptical galaxy models .",
    "chiosi & bressan ( 1997 ) have presented their first ( preliminary ) grid of elliptical galaxy models , based upon the padoan ( 1997 ) variable - imf formalism .",
    "these models were designed primarily to satisfy one projection of the fundamental plane ( specifically , m / l@xmath41 versus m@xmath41 ) , while still retaining consistency with the underlying galaxy cml relations and observed @xmath2-element _ stellar population overabundance . while successful in satisfying these constraints , there are two equally important observational constraints which are clearly violated . _    first , local dwarf ellipticals such as fornax , ngc 185 , and ngc 205 , each host populations of planetary nebulae with [ o / fe ] typically @xmath57 , and ages presumably on the order of several gyrs ( richer , mccall & arimoto 1997 )",
    ". an inescapable result of the chiosi & bressan ( 1997 ) `` canonical '' dwarf elliptical ( de ) model ( see their figure 2 ) is that de planetary nebulae , of this typical age , should have [ o / fe ] of @xmath58 , a factor of @xmath53 lower than that observed .",
    "second , and perhaps more important , is the predicted icm [ o / fe ] from the chiosi & bressan ( 1997 ) grid . as their dwarf ellipticals never develop galactic winds ,",
    "it is really only the @xmath59l@xmath60 galaxies which can contribute to the observed [ o / fe]@xmath61 ( mushotzky 1996 ) .",
    "again , referring to their figure 1 , we can see that their @xmath59l@xmath60 ellipticals develop galactic winds after @xmath62 gyrs , by which point the ism [ o / fe ] has been reduced to @xmath63 ( their figure 2 ) .",
    "_ this factor of @xmath64 discrepancy between observed and theoretical icm [ o / fe ] points to a significant deficiency in the existing elliptical galaxy variable - imf models .",
    "_    third , the chiosi & bressan ( 1997 ) @xmath59l@xmath60 model ( again , coupling their figure 1 with the adopted star formation formalism ) shows a star formation rate , in the core alone ( where @xmath65% of the galaxy s luminous mass lies ) , ranging from @xmath66 m@xmath18/yr from redshifts of @xmath31 to @xmath67 .",
    "the total _ global star formation rate is @xmath68 this _ core value .",
    "such star formation rates at @xmath69 ( @xmath70 m@xmath18 ) , regardless of imf , are clearly at odds with the cosmological number counts ( charlot & silk 1995 ) , although a more formal analysis , in a cosmological context , is postponed for the time being . _ _    to end on a positive note though , the above arguments do not necessarily preclude the possibility that future , more sophisticated , variable - imf models , may reconcile _ all of the galaxy cml relations _ and icm constraints .",
    "it should be re - iterated that the chiosi & bressan ( 1997 ) results are still preliminary , and that the full parameter space still needs to be explored .",
    "what is clear though , is that the models presented _ thus far are not necessarily the panacea they might at first appear to be .",
    "we have constructed a grid of gas infall models of elliptical galaxies , based upon the favoured sequence of kodama & arimoto ( 1997 ) . for an imf power - law slope @xmath8 , the models are entirely consistent with the observed , present - day , colour - luminosity relations for cluster ellipticals . while previous closed - box models were equally successful in recovering the optical - infrared relations , the infall models do have the advantage of a better fit to the ultraviolet - optical relations ( albeit , at the expense of a poorer fit to the metallicity - luminosity relation ) .",
    "we assess qualitatively the ability of padoan s ( 1997 ) variable - imf scenario , as adopted by chiosi & bressan ( 1997 ) , to circumvent the closed - box / infall `` problems '' , and conclude that the extent models admittedly minimise some of these problems , _ but only at the expense of introducing new ones . _",
    "for the first time , we have employed infall models as input to simple cluster enrichment scenarios . for the published grids , which appear to favour imf slopes similar to that of the canonical salpeter ( 1955 ) value ( @xmath71 )",
    ", an inescapable conclusion is that the predicted mass of iron ejected to a cluster s icm is a factor of @xmath31 below that observed . only by substantially `` flattening '' the imf ( to @xmath72 ) , were we able to construct an `` infall '' grid which was consistent with _ both the galactic colour - luminosity relations and icm iron mass - cluster luminosity relation , albeit at ( a ) the expense of modestly worsening the galactic metallicity - luminosity relation , and ( b ) overproducing icm gas for all but the richest clusters .",
    "this latter point may be indicative of a fundamental flaw in the infall picture , but we prefer to reserve judgment on this point until more sophisticated models have been explored . _    in the meantime though , we are able to conclude that , by adopting an already accepted ( tantalo 1996 ; kodama & arimoto 1997 ) formalism for elliptical galaxy evolution based upon gas infall , the imf must necessarily favour the formation of massive stars ( be `` top - heavy '' ) if the models are to conform to the present - day cml relations , as well as the icm abundance constraints",
    ". this agrees with our earlier studies based upon the more conventional closed - box model ( matteucci & gibson 1995 ; gibson & matteucci 1997 ) .",
    "it is encouraging that two such disparate approaches ( closed - box versus infall ) to modeling the evolution of ellipticals _ both lead to the same conclusion regarding the veracity of the top - heavy imf hypothesis . _",
