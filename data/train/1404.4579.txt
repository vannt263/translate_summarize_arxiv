    "5_d _ transition metal oxide materials have recently attracted significant interest due to the comparable energy scales of crystal field stabilization , electronic correlations ( hubbard u ) , and spin - orbit coupling @xcite . in particular , iridium oxides are of great interest due to the ability of ir to adopt a _ d_@xmath10 electronic configuration in its 4 + oxidation state , yielding a singly - occupied orbital with non - trivial spin texture in the strong spin - orbit coupling limit .",
    "this electronic configuration has been predicted to give rise to an unusual pattern of superexchange interactions , resulting in magnetic frustration and possible spin liquid behavior @xcite .",
    "for this reason , the _ a_@xmath3iro@xmath9 ( _ a _ = li , na ) family of layered honeycomb materials have been the subject of intense scrutiny @xcite .",
    "the majority of experimental work on na@xmath3iro@xmath9 and li@xmath3iro@xmath9 has focused on single - crystalline specimens grown via  self - flux . \" despite strong antiferromagnetic interactions in na@xmath3iro@xmath9 , evidenced by a reported large negative weiss temperature @xmath11 = -116 k , long - range antiferromagnetic order is only present below a nel temperature of @xmath12 = 15 k , demonstrating that that na@xmath3iro@xmath9 is in a magnetically frustrated regime @xcite .",
    "a study of the ( na@xmath1li@xmath2)@xmath3iro@xmath9 solid solution revealed that @xmath11 as well as @xmath12 vary significantly with _",
    "x _ , and the magnetism reaches a peak in frustration at the intermediate value of _ x _ = 0.7 @xcite .",
    "isovalent substitution of li for na in the _ a_@xmath3iro@xmath9 structure presumably has the effect of modulating the exchange interaction strengths between neighboring ir sites , however this effect has not been systematically explored .",
    "recently , a broad variety of new ternary ir oxides with the formula na@xmath0_m_ir@xmath3o@xmath4 ( _ m _ = zn , cu , ni , co , fe and mn ) were reported @xcite , but no unifying picture of the magnetism demonstrated by this family can yet be drawn .    here , we report another new member of this chemical family , na@xmath0(na@xmath1mg@xmath2)ir@xmath3o@xmath4 , in which mg substitutes for na in the honeycomb planes and the na content between planes is variable ( fig .",

    "aliovalent substitution of mg for na in the honeycomb plane offers a convenient and controllable method by which to tune the lattice parameters of the unit cell and , in doing so , vary the exchange interactions between neighboring ir sites .",
    "additionally , we resolve the discrepancy in magnetic behavior between polycrystalline and single - crystalline samples of na@xmath3iro@xmath9 , where the former are spin glasses and the latter exhibit long range antiferromagnetic ( afm ) order @xcite , by showing that na@xmath3iro@xmath9 decomposes rapidly in air as previously reported , and that this decomposition destroys afm order @xcite .",

    "the pellet was then reground with an additional 5 mol % na@xmath3co@xmath9 , pelletized , and placed into a furnace preheated to 900 @xmath13c where it dwelled for and additional 48 hrs .",
    "after the final heating , samples were removed from the furnace and allowed to cool in an argon filled glovebox to prevent reaction with laboratory air .",
    "polycrystalline samples of na@xmath0(na@xmath1mg@xmath2ir@xmath3)o@xmath4 were prepared via a similar method : na@xmath3co@xmath9 , mgo and ir metal powder were intimately ground and pelletized .",

    "samples were then reground , pelletized , and placed into a furnace preheated to 900 @xmath13c where they dwelled for between 48 and 96 hrs , followed by quenching in air .",
    "the 900 @xmath13c heating was repeated with intermediate regrindings until the laboratory x - ray powder diffraction ( xrpd ) data showed no impurity phases and no change in lattice parameters or relative peak intensities between subsequent heatings .",
    "after the final heating , samples were processed and stored in an argon - filled glovebox to prevent reaction with air .",
    "samples of suitable size for neutron powder diffraction ( npd ) were prepared via a similar method , but with an additional two week heating at 900 @xmath13c .",

    "the structure of the _ a_@xmath3iro@xmath9 family of materials is derived from the layered triangular lattice compound @xmath14nafeo@xmath3 ( fig .",
    "[ structure](a ) ) : when na substitutes for one third of the fe sites in nafeo@xmath3 in an ordered fashion , a layered honeycomb lattice is formed and the chemical formula becomes na@xmath3feo@xmath9 .",
    "for this reason , the structural formula of _ a_@xmath3iro@xmath9 can be described more intuitively as _",
    "a_@xmath9_a_@xmath18ir@xmath3o@xmath4 , where electronically active _ a_@xmath18ir@xmath3o@xmath4 honeycomb layers , comprised of tilted , edge - sharing octahedra , are separated by electronically inert layers of _ a _ cations .",
    "the honeycomb order in these layers is energetically favorable due to the large differences in atomic radii and oxidation states of ir in comparison to the _",
    "a_@xmath18 cation . because electronically active honeycomb layers are separated by electronically inert triangular layers , the _",
    "a_@xmath3iro@xmath9 family are essentially layered two dimensional materials",
    ". this fact can give rise both to interesting physics , and to complex structural disorder .",
    "[ stacking](a ) shows simulated xrpd data that demonstrate how disordered stacking arrangements affect the observed xrpd pattern .",
    "when honeycomb lattices are stacked in a perfectly ordered manner , sharp reflections are observed in the xrpd data between scattering angle 2_@xmath19 _  =  19@xmath13 and 32@xmath13  these are often referred to as supercell reflections , as the arise from the additional honeycomb ordering within the triangular layer .",
    "this structure ( fig .  [ structure](a ) ) can be accounted for by a larger r@xmath20 cell where the _ a _ axis is expanded by @xmath21 compared to the triangular r@xmath20 cell , or to lower symmetry variations such as the monoclinic c2/_m _ or c2/_c _ cells commonly observed ( fig .  [ structure](b ) ) @xcite .",
    "if stacking faults are introduced , even with a low probability of occurrence , the supercell reflections become broadened and attenuated as shown in fig .",

    "[ stacking](b ) shows xrpd data collected on three different samples of na@xmath22iro@xmath9 , each with a different degree of structural disorder .",
    "rietveld refinement to data collected on a sample with stacking faults can incorrectly account for the observed loss in supercell reflection intensity by introducing cation site mixing in the honeycomb plane .",
    "the energy cost associated with producing a stacking fault in na@xmath3iro@xmath9 and structurally analogous systems is very small , and is thus significantly more likely to occur than antisite disorder @xcite .",
    "similarly , a refinement can give the illusion of small particle size in order to account for the observed broadening of the supercell reflections .",
    "the same effect is observed in neutron diffraction , though the honeycomb order may be less apparent if atoms in the honeycomb layer have similar neutron scattering cross sections .",
    "it is therefore quite difficult to make accurate structural characterizations of samples with significant stacking disorder using neutron or x - ray diffraction techniques .",

    "the reflections were properly indexed using the lower symmetry monoclinic space group c2/_m _ ( 12 ) . in order to determine cation site occupancies ,",
    "it was assumed that no site mixing occurs between sites in the honeycomb plane ( 4_g _ and 2_a _ ) , and the 4_g _ site was fixed at full ir occupancy .",
    "the 2_a _ site was assumed to have mixed na / mg occupancy .",
    "it was further assumed that mg only substitutes for na at the 2_a _ site .",

    "the structures of all other samples in the series were characterized via laboratory xrpd .",
    "rietveld refinements were carried out using the reported structure for na@xmath3iro@xmath9 ( space group c2/_m _ ) @xcite . however , because ir is the dominant x - ray scatterer and stacking disorder is present , the _ a _ and _ b _ lattice parameters of the monoclinic cell were first obtained by performing a le bail fit to the data using space group r@xmath20 , where the _ a_-axis is the nearest - neighbor distance in the honeycomb lattice .",
