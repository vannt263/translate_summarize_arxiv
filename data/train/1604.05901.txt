    "the principle bounds the uncertainties about the outcomes of two incompatible measurements , such as position and momentum on a particle .",
    "the more precisely the position of a particle is determined , the less precisely its momentum can be known , and vice versa .",
    "this lack of knowledge , so - called uncertainty , was quantified by heisenberg using the standard deviation .",

    "uncertainty relations are useful for a wide range of applications in quantum technologies including quantum cryptography , quantum entanglement , quantum computation and general physics as well . in detail , they are useful for formulating quantum mechanics  @xcite ( e.g. to justify the complex structure of the hilbert space or as a fundamental building block for quantum mechanics and quantum gravity ) , for studying measurement - induced disturbance  @xcite , for entanglement detection  @xcite , for security analysis of quantum cryptography  @xcite and so on .",
    "uncertainty relations were tested experimentally with neutronic  @xcite and photonic qubits  @xcite .    however heisenberg - robertson relation ( 1 ) does not fully capture the notion of incompatible observables since it is expressed in terms of the _ product _ of the variances of measurements of the observables .",
    "it means the product is zero when either of the two variances is zero even if the other variance is non - zero .",
    "this is the flaw in heisenberg - robertson relation .    to overcome this limitation , maccone and",
    "pati  @xcite have proposed two new uncertainty relations that employ the _ sum _ of the variances of measurements of general observables .",
    "since the variance is a positive quantity , the sum will always be non - zero unless both variances are zero and this case only happens if the observables are ",
    "compatible \" meaning they have a definite value .",
    "we report an experimental test of the new uncertainty relations for a single - photon measurement and demonstrate they are valid for states of a spin-@xmath3 particle  @xcite .",
    "compared to the previous experiments which have come close to the original uncertainty limit  @xcite , but did not overcome the inherent flaw , our experimental results fully capture the notion of incompatible observables in contrast to heisenberg - robertson inequality thus making the uncertainty relations much stronger .",
    "the results also explain so - called complementarity  an extreme form of uncertainty ( here variance is used as a measure of uncertainty ) , i.e. , one of the two properties of a system is perfectly known , and the other is completely uncertain , which is a situation where heisenberg - robertson inequality fails to explain .",
    "furthermore , in our experiment , every term can be obtained directly by the outcomes of the projective measurements .",

    "the uncertainty inequality in ( 2 ) is tight , i.e. , it becomes an equality by maximizing over @xmath7 .",
    "for example , if @xmath4 is one of the eigenstates of the observable @xmath0 , the optimal choice of @xmath7 is @xmath8 , or @xmath9 for the case that @xmath4 is one of the eigenstates of the observable @xmath1 .",

    "the lower bound of ( 3 ) is nonzero unless @xmath4 is an eigenstate of @xmath13 .",
    "the inequality ( 3 ) becomes an equality if the state @xmath4 is an eigenstate of @xmath14 .",
    "we show an example by choosing two components of the angular momentum for a spin-@xmath3 particle as two incompatible observables @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and a family of states being measured  @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 are the eigenstates of @xmath19 corresponding to the eigenvalues @xmath20 , and @xmath21 $ ] is the coefficient .",
