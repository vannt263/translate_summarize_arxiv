    "@xcite originated the idea that core - collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) may be neutrino driven .",
    "because realistically modeling ccsne is a computationally complex task of tying together hydrodynamics , neutrino transport , general relativity ( gr ) , nuclear burning , and a realistic equation of state ( eos ) , and since the many feedbacks and the nonlinearity of the process preclude an analytical treatment , progress in the field has been closely tied to advances in computational resources and code development @xcite .",
    "two decades ago advances of this sort made possible the first generation of ccsne simulations in two dimensions ( 2d ) @xcite .",
    "these simulations , by allowing , among other things , neutrino - driven convection below the shock and continued accretion and shock expansion to coexist , gave explosions .",
    "in contrast , continually refined spherically - symmetric ccsne simulations failed to explode except for the lightest progenitors @xcite .",

    "while the first - generation 2d ccsne simulations were limited by their use of gray neutrino transport or precomputed spectral neutrino transport , current computing resources have permitted second - generation 2d ccsne simulations with self - consistent , spectral neutrino transport @xcite , essential for accurately computing the neutrino ",

    "the initial oscillations of the proto - neutron star ( pns ) periodically strengthen and weaken the shock , causing entropy - unstable pockets and transient convective episodes behind the shock .",
    "by @xmath41  ms an extended unstable entropy gradient has developed behind the shock as it weakens , extending down to @xmath42  km and driving a brief episode of convection ( figure  [ fig : entropy ] ; 12  ms panel ) .",
    "this episode of `` prompt '' convection has little appreciable effect on the shock , and by @xmath43  ms convective activity has ceased .    up to @xmath44  ms , the shock trajectories of corresponding 1d and 2d models",
    "track each other closely ( figure  [ fig : shocks ] ; lower panel ) .",
    "remarkably , the shock trajectories for different progenitors track each other rather closely as well .",
    "this is a consequence of the compensating factors that determine the radius of the shock during its quasi - stationary accretion phase . referring to equation  1 of @xcite , these factors ( graphed for b12-wh07 and b25-wh07 in figure  [ fig : analytic ] ; upper panel ) are the pns radius and the @xmath45-sphere temperature , whose increase increases the shock radius , and the pns mass and the mass accretion rate at the shock whose increase has the opposite effect . despite the variations of these factors , their combination during the quasi - stationary accretion phase ( figure  [ fig : analytic ] ; upper panel , solid lines ) are quite similar .    at @xmath44  ms several evolutionary developments occur in all 2d models , causing the shock trajectories of the 1d and 2d models to diverge .",
    "first , the ratio of @xmath46 , the advection timescale through the gain region ( region of positive net neutrino heating below the shock ) , to @xmath47 , the brunt - visla convective growth timescale , begins to exceed the critical value @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "convection in the gain region begins ( figure  [ fig : entropy ] ; 90  ms panel ) , driven by neutrino heating and seeded by the prompt convection episode .",
    "neutrino - driven convection pushes the shock out , enlarging the gain region , and increasing @xmath46 .",
    "second , the ratio of @xmath46  to @xmath49  ( ratio of the thermal energy @xmath50  to the net neutrino heating rate @xmath51 in the gain region ) begins to exceed unity .",
    "( using the total energy rather than @xmath50  to compute @xmath49  increases by @xmath52% the time from bounce for @xmath46/@xmath49   to exceed unity . )",
    "this signals the beginning of rising entropy in the gain region and an eventual shock revival @xcite .",
    "third , the sasi begins to manifest through low - mode distortions of the shock and oscillating patterns of the radial velocity ( evident in the animated version of figure  [ fig : entropy ] ) , causing , for example , the gain region to swell along the poles and contract in the equatorial regions ( figure  [ fig : entropy ] ; 150  ms panel ) .",
    "this distortion mode increases @xmath53 in the expanded regions and decreases it in the contracted regions creating outflow plumes and inflow funnels in the former and latter regions , respectively .",
    "thus , while the shocks of the 1d models slowly contract after @xmath44  ms , the average shock radii of the 2d models continue to slowly increase .",
    "the expansion accelerates until @xmath54  ms ( figure  [ fig : shocks ] ) .",
    "going from b12-wh07 to b25-wh07 , @xmath51 increases @xmath55@xmath56 fold , @xmath50 increases @xmath57 fold , and @xmath46  decreases @xmath57 fold , consequently @xmath58 at about the same @xmath39  for all four models . on the other hand ,",
    "the decrease in @xmath46   noticeably delays the onset of neutrino - driven convection in the more massive models  from @xmath59  ms ( b12-wh07 ) to @xmath44  ms ( b25-wh07 ) .",
    "consequently , it appears that neutrino - driven convection precedes the sasi in b12-wh07 but follows it in the b25-wh07 , the sasi having time to saturate in the latter model before the onset of convection ( cf .",
    "b15-wh07 and b20-wh07 are intermediate cases and precedence of convection or the sasi is not clear .    a legendre decomposition of the shock deformation ( computed per * ? ? ?",
    "* ) indicates that the growth of the sasi is dominated by the @xmath60 ( quadrapolar ) mode in b12-wh07 and b15-wh07 , while the @xmath61 ( dipolar ) mode is dominant in b20-wh07 and b25-wh07 .",
    "the subsequent rise in the amplitude of shock deformation as the shock begins to accelerate outward is always dominated by the @xmath61 mode .",
    "the shock deformation oscillates , with a period increasing with the progenitor mass , from 18  ms for b12-wh07 to 30  ms for b25-wh07 , though period variations are seen in each model .",
    "the neutrino luminosities @xmath62 and rms energies @xmath63 for all models follow a similar pattern to that of b12-wh07 ( figure  [ fig : analytic ] ; lower panel ) . following the @xmath19-break - out burst , the luminosities of all neutrino species peak between 100 and 200  ms .",
    "the @xmath19- , @xmath20-luminosities , which arise both from the core and from the energy released by accreting matter , exhibit a more pronounced peak during the peak of the mass accretion rate than @xmath64 and @xmath65 , which arise more exclusively from the core .",
    "after 200  ms there is a rapid falloff in @xmath66 and @xmath67 as the shock begins to accelerate outward and the mass accretion rate declines .",
    "@xmath63 follows the usual hierarchy , with energy increasing from @xmath19  to @xmath20  to @xmath68  to @xmath69 , the latter three becoming separated by only a few mev after several hundred ms .",
    "the split between @xmath70  and @xmath71  is due to weak magnetism , which increases ( decreases ) the opacities of @xmath68  ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "weak magnetism also causes the @xmath20-luminosity to exceed the @xmath19-luminosity at times after after bounce for this model , though the @xmath19  number luminosity is always dominant ..",
    "@xmath63 for all neutrino species increases slowly as the @xmath45-spheres contract and heat along with the pns .",
    "progenitor masses are correlated with the compactness parameter of @xcite ( see table  [ tab : models ] ) , and the luminosities of all neutrino flavors increase with this parameter , nearly doubling from b12-wh07 to b25-wh07 between 50 and 250  ms after bounce .",
    "@xmath63 , however , shows only a small increase ( a few mev ) with compactness .",
    "these trends can be attributed to the dependence of the luminosity on @xmath72 and the dependence of the @xmath63 only on @xmath73 , where @xmath74 and @xmath73 are radius and temperature of the @xmath45-sphere , both of which increase with the progenitor compactness during the accretion shock phase ( figure  [ fig : analytic ] , upper panel ; note @xmath75 ) .",
    "for all the models , @xmath62 and @xmath63 are initially isotropic .",
    "by @xmath76  ms and @xmath77  ms for the lower and higher mass models , respectively , anisotropies @xmath110% in @xmath78 appear on an @xmath79 scale , the scale of the entropy - driven convection appearing for these models at that time .",
    "the @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) maxima are anti - correlated ( correlated ) with the convective plumes , the plumes having higher entropy but lower electron fraction ( higher positron density ) .",
    "by @xmath80  ms anisotropies exist at the @xmath1  30% level in all models on a scale of @xmath813 , with @xmath66 and @xmath67 maxima becoming more correlated with each other and with the convective plumes and accretion funnels that frequently curve beneath them .",
    "by @xmath82  ms , and thereafter , there is a strong @xmath61 and @xmath81 component in the @xmath78 anisotropy , again correlated with the morphology of the expanding hot plumes and accretion funnels ( figure  [ fig : entropy ] ; bottom four panels ) .",
    "@xmath83 remain quite isotropic up to 200  ms after bounce , but follow , with smaller amplitude , the anisotropic pattern of @xmath78 thereafter .    at @xmath54  ms several parameters indicate imminent shock revival and the onset of explosion for each model .",
    "first , around this time ( noted as @xmath9  in table [ tab : models ] ) , the mass residing in the gain region begins to rapidly increase , which increases @xmath46   and heating efficiency @xcite .",
    "second , the @xmath53 rises significantly above unity around this time , signaling shock revival @xcite .",
    "third , near this time , the mean shock radius exceeds 500 km ( denoted @xmath11 in table [ tab : models ] ) .",
    "a useful parameter characterizing the morphology of the expanding shock is the shock deformation parameter,@xmath84 @xcite , where @xmath85 is the shock radius as a function of the polar angle , @xmath17 .",
    "prolate , oblate , and spherical shocks have positive , negative , and vanishing values of @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "values of @xmath16  for the models at @xmath86  ms ( table  [ tab : models ] ) indicate that the shock in three models is significantly prolate while for b20-wh07 it is nearly spherical ( see also figure [ fig : shocks ] , upper panel ) .",
    "a measure of the explosion energy frequently used is the diagnostic energy , @xmath13  ( integral of total energy , = kinetic + internal + gravitational , where positive ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : energy ] we show @xmath13  for our models , as well as two other measures of the explosion energy : @xmath87 overburden , and @xmath88 recombination energy .",
    "the overburden is the total energy of all negative energy zones on the grid above the innermost positive energy zones plus the total energy of the off - grid material ; the recombination energy is the energy that would be released if all @xmath89he and neutron  proton pairs recombined to @xmath90ni in the positive total energy zones . we expect that @xmath14  and @xmath15  bound the eventual observable explosion energy from below and above , respectively .    at 500",
    "ms all three explosion energy measures are positive , and increasing , for b12-wh07 , b15-wh07 , and b20-wh07 , but only @xmath13  is positive for b25-wh07 due to its large off - grid binding energy of -0.655  b. for b12-wh07 at 850  ms , the post - shock velocities exceed escape velocity over one quarter of the shock surface ; the accretion rate onto the pns is essentially zero ; and the model is beginning to transit from the simultaneous accretion and outflow phase to the wind phase . the b12-wh07 explosion energies at 850  ms are @xmath91  b , @xmath92  b , and @xmath93  b and appear to be leveling off .",
    "these energies are broadly consistent with observations for lower mass progenitors @xcite .",
    "we have presented results of _ ab initio _ axisymmetric core - collapse supernova simulations with _",
    "detailed _ spectral neutrino transport for a suite of four nonrotating models spanning the mass range 1225  @xmath0 , through @xmath86  ms for b15-wh07 , b20-wh07 , and b25-wh07 , and @xmath94  ms for b12-wh07 . at 500",
    "ms , all models show clear indications of developing neutrino - driven explosions , aided initially by strong convective and sasi activity , which imparts pronounced prolate shock deformations in b12-wh07 , b15-wh07 , and b25-wh07 , indicating that large explosion asymmetries are probable ( in agreement with observation ) .    the development of explosions in these models , taking 208236  ms for the mean shock to reach 500  km , is much slower than in older models  for example , the delayed model of wilson used by @xcite , for which @xmath95  ms , or the 2d gray neutrino transport models of @xcite , for which @xmath96  ms .",
    "the explosion development times of the chimera  models reported here are comparable to those of the garching group for their models that use modern progenitors ( @xmath97  ms for model g11 from @xcite and @xmath98  ms for model s27 from @xcite ) , but significantly shorter than for their models that use older progenitors ( @xmath99  ms for model g15 of @xcite ) .",
    "this suggests a significant progenitor dependence , which makes detailed comparisons difficult .",
    "the most pronounced difference between our models and those of the garching group is the growth of the explosion energy .",
    "for example , once the explosion develops , @xmath13  for both their g15 and s27 models @xcite grow at a rate of @xmath100  @xmath101 , a quarter of the rate in our model b15-wh07 .",
    "the diagnostic energy in the g11 model saturates at @xmath102 , one tenth of the value of our model b12-wh07 .",
    "future simulations with both groups using identical progenitors will help elucidate the source of these differences .",
    "final conclusions regarding the viability of the neutrino - driven ccsn mechanism must wait until different groups obtain similar results from detailed _ ab initio _",
