    "<S> time evolution of a black hole lattice universe is simulated . the vacuum einstein equations in a cubic box with a black hole at the origin are numerically solved with periodic boundary conditions on all pairs of faces opposite to each other . defining effective scale factors by using the area of a surface and the length of an edge of the cubic box , we compare them with that in the einstein - de sitter universe . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the behaviour of the effective scale factors is well approximated by that in the einstein - de sitter universe . in our model , if the box size is sufficiently larger than the horizon radius , local inhomogeneities do not significantly affect the global expansion law of the universe even though the inhomogeneity is extremely nonlinear .    </S>",
    "<S> the effect of local inhomogeneity on the global expansion of the universe has drawn much attention as one of fundamental issues in relativistic cosmology for many years . </S>",
    "<S> one remarkable work has been done by lindquist and wheeler in 1957@xcite . in this work </S>",
    "<S> , they investigated the so - called  black hole lattice universe \" composed of @xmath0 cells(@xmath15 , 8 , 16 , 24 , 120 and 600 ) on the three sphere each of which has a black hole at the center . </S>",
    "<S> although the lattice universe is not an exact solution , with help from an intuitive idea , it is shown that the radius of the three dimensional sphere at maximum expansion asymptotes to that of the homogeneous and isotropic dust dominated closed universe for a large value of @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , similar inhomogeneous universe models to the black hole lattice universe have been investigated by using analytical or numerical techniques@xcite . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we numerically construct an expanding inhomogeneous universe model which is composed of regularly aligned black holes with an identical mass @xmath2 , and compare the cosmic expansion rate of this inhomogeneous universe model with that of the homogeneous and isotropic universe . hereafter , we call this inhomogeneous universe model  black hole universe \" .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we use the geometrized units in which the speed of light and newton s gravitational constant are one , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the greek indices represent spacetime components , whereas the small latin indices represent spatial components .    the way to construct the initial data of black hole universe is described in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we briefly summarise it . </S>",
    "<S> we adopt the cartesian coordinate system @xmath3 and focus on a cubic region @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) with a non - rotating black hole at the origin . </S>",
    "<S> we call the faces of this cubic box the _ boundary _ in this paper . because of the discrete symmetry , using conventional decomposition of the einstein equations , we can reduce the constraint equations to three coupled poisson equations with reflection boundary condition in the region @xmath6 </S>",
    "<S> . one of the equations is the hamiltonian constraint equation for the conformal factor and the others are momentum constraint equations for longitudinal parts of the extrinsic curvature . to solve the equations , we need to fix the functional form of the trace part of the extrinsic curvature @xmath7 . by the volume integral of the hamiltonian constraint equation , </S>",
    "<S> we get an integrability condition which implies that there must be a domain with non - vanishing @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> since it is the simplest and the most convenient for our purpose to select @xmath7 vanishing in the neighbourhood of the origin , we adopt the following functional form of @xmath7 : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a positive constant which corresponds to the effective hubble parameter , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 ^ 6&{\\rm for}~\\ell\\leq r \\leq \\ell   + \\sigma\\\\ 1&{\\rm for}~\\ell+\\sigma \\leq r \\\\ \\end{array}\\right.,\\ ] ] with @xmath12 and @xmath13 being constants which satisfy @xmath14 . an appropriate extraction of @xmath15 divergence of the conformal factor allows us to solve the coupled poisson equations numerically . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that the value of @xmath9 must be determined so that the integrability condition is satisfied , that is , we can not freely choose the parameter @xmath9 but must appropriately fix the value during the numerical iteration . since the results are not significantly dependent on @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and @xmath16 in our calculation . </S>",
    "<S> ] the physical dimensionless parameter which characterises the initial data is only @xmath17 . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we could get convergence for @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> we adopt the case @xmath19 as the initial data for the evolution in this paper .    </S>",
    "<S> the numerical time evolution is followed by cosmos code which is an einstein equation solver written in c++ by means of the bssn formalism  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the algorithm is based on sacra code  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the 4th order finite differencing in space with uni - grid and 4th order time integration with a runge - kutta method in cartesian coordinates are adopted in cosmos code . </S>",
    "<S> an apparent horizon solver based on ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite is implemented .    </S>",
    "<S> we write the line element of the spacetime as @xmath20 in order to determine the time slicing , we adopt the following condition : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the trace of the extrinsic curvature at the vertex @xmath23 at each time step . as for the spatial coordinates , </S>",

    "<S> we define the cosmic expansion rate by using boundary variables on the geodesic slices  @xcite which is occasionally called constant proper time slices . in order to know the geometry of the boundary on the geodesic slices , we need to solve timelike geodesic equations on the boundary . </S>",
    "<S> 3 + 1 decomposition of geodesic equations is clearly described in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . using the unit vector @xmath28 normal to the timeslices </S>",
    "<S> , we can decompose the unit tangent vector field of the timelike geodesic congruence as follows : @xmath29 where @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> let us represent a timelike geodesic by @xmath31 , where @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> then , we have  @xcite @xmath33-\\gamma^{ij}{\\partial}_jn - v^j{\\partial}_j\\beta^i , \\label{geoeq2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the christoffel symbol for the spatial metric @xmath35 , and @xmath36 the relation between the proper time @xmath37 and the time coordinate is given by @xmath38 the initial conditions for geodesic equations are given by @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 in our simulation . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath43 always hold . solving eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> , and , we obtain the proper time in the form of @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) . </S>",
    "<S> then , the line element @xmath46 of the boundary @xmath42 on a hypersurface with a constant @xmath37 , i.e. , a geodesic slice is given by @xmath47{\\mathrm{d}}x^a{\\mathrm{d}}x^b . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we numerically obtain the proper area @xmath48 of the surface @xmath49 and the proper length @xmath50 of the edge @xmath51 by using this induced metric . </S>",
    "<S> then , we define the effective scale factors as functions of the proper time as follows : @xmath52    since the coarse - grained black hole universe can be regarded as a homogeneous and isotropic universe model with vanishing spatial curvature by its construction , we compare the expansion rate of the black hole universe with that in the einstein - de sitter(eds ) universe . to compare the effective scale factors defined by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ a - def ] ) with that in the eds universe , we define a fiducial scale factor </S>",
    "<S> . the general form of the scale factor in the eds universe is given by @xmath53 then we determine two parameters @xmath54 and @xmath55 by the least - square fitting of this function with the numerical data in a reliable region of @xmath37 . using this expression , </S>",
    "<S> the effective hubble parameter is given by @xmath56    we performed the numerical simulation with four different resolutions : r1 , r2 , r3 and r4 . </S>",
    "<S> the interval of coordinate grids for each numerical run is given by @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 for r1 , r2 , r3 and r4 , respectively .    before showing the results of effective scale factors , we note the resolution of the apparent horizon and constraint violation . at the initial moment , an almost spherical apparent horizon with the coordinate radius @xmath61 exists . as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ahfig ] , the coordinate radius of the apparent horizon decreases as it evolves .        at some time </S>",
    "<S> , our apparent horizon finder fails to find out the horizon because of the limitation of the resolution . </S>",
    "<S> for r4 , it happens at @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> while the horizon can be found , variation of the horizon area is smaller than 0.1% , which is the same order as the typical fraction of violation of the hamiltonian constraint as is shown below . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the horizon area is constant in time within our numerical precision .    as is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : hamicon ] , after the failure in the apparent horizon search , the violation of the hamiltonian constraint propagates outward , and the reliable region becomes narrower as time goes on . </S>",
    "<S> however , the numerical computation does not crash and we can proceed with the calculation .    </S>",
    "<S> -axis for r4 . </S>",
    "<S> zero means no violation whereas one corresponds to the largest violation . ]    </S>",
    "<S> even after the size of apparent horizon becomes too small to be resolved , the spacetime in the vicinity of the boundary is simulated with sufficient accuracy , since the present numerical results on the behaviours of the effective scale factors pass the convergence test . in order to show the convergence clearly </S>",
    "<S> , we depict the root - mean - square value of errors in the hamiltonian constraint at grid points on the boundary in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ hamconboundary ] . </S>",
    "<S> it is seen from this figure that the error reduces with higher spatial resolution . in the beginning of the simulation </S>",
    "<S> , we find accurate second order convergence that the error scales to @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the initial data sets are given by the 2nd order successive - over - relaxation method for each resolution@xcite , although the evolution code has the 4th order accuracy .        in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : prop ] , we show the effective scale factors as functions of the proper time .     as functions of @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath64 almost overlaps @xmath65 . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the fiducial scale factor @xmath66 determined by fitting with r4 is also shown . </S>",
    "<S> the fitting is done in the region @xmath67 , in which the results of all runs almost coincide with each other . </S>",
    "<S> the given value of parameters are @xmath68 and @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> we also show the deviation of the effective scale factors from @xmath66 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ propdev ] .     and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath70 from @xmath71 for each resolution . </S>",
    "<S> , title=\"fig : \" ]   and @xmath70 from @xmath71 for each resolution . </S>",
    "<S> , title=\"fig : \" ]    it can be found from fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : prop ] and [ propdev ] that the behaviour of the effective scale factors for r4 is well approximated by that of the eds universe in the shown period of @xmath37 except for a short period in the beginning . </S>",
    "<S> this result is consistent with the suggestion given by the numerical simulation of the collapsing eight - black - hole lattice@xcite and an initial data sequence@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it would be worth to note the reason why we have defined the effective scale factor by eq .  . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is that , since the total volume inside the box is infinite , it is hard to define the volume average in a physically meaningful manner . therefore we do not use the spatial volume average to define the effective scale factor differently from other many related works(see e.g. ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and references therein ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the number of black holes @xmath72 inside the hubble radius @xmath73 is given by @xmath74 and we obtain @xmath75 for @xmath76 . as was discussed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , it is expected that the deviation of the black hole universe from the eds one becomes the smaller , the larger @xmath72 becomes , or in other words , the effects of local inhomogeneities on the global expansion law is negligible if @xmath72 is sufficiently large . </S>",
    "<S> if so , the expansion law of the black hole universe will approach to that of the eds universe as it expands , and the present result supports this expectation .    </S>",
    "<S> the universe model studied here is highly idealised , since this work is the first step in the study of the universe dominated by black holes . </S>",
    "<S> the generalisations of our toy model to that with varieties of mass and separation etc . and the dependence of the results on them are still open issues which should be clarified in the future . </S>"
