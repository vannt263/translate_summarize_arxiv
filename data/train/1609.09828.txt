    "the standard cosmological model ( @xmath0cdm model ) , which describes the universe , is the most favored by astronomical observations such as supernovae of type ia or measurements of cmb . in the @xmath0cdm model ,",
    "the dark matter is treated as dust and dark energy has the form of the cosmological constant @xmath6 .",
    "we are looking an alternative for the @xmath0cdm model by a modification of the dark energy term .",
    "the standard cosmological model possesses the six parameters : the density of baryons @xmath7 , the density of cold dark matter @xmath8 , angular diameter of sound horizon at last scattering @xmath9 , the optical depth due to the reionisation @xmath10 , the slope of the primordial power spectrum of fluctuations @xmath11 , and the amplitude of the primordial power spectrum @xmath12 , where @xmath13 [ @xmath14 .    from the methodological point of view",
    ", the standard cosmological model plays the role of an effective theory , which very well describes properties of the current universe without explaining the nature of two components of the model : the dark energy and the dark matter .",
    "the nature of both components of the universe is unknown up to now but we describe these in terms of useful fiction , the cosmological constant and the cold dark matter which is kind of the dust perfect fluid .    in this paper",
    "we concentrate on the interpretation of dark energy rather in terms of running cosmological constant than in term of the pure cosmological constant parameter ( @xmath15 in our approach ) .",
    "it is consequence of some problems with interpretation of of pure the cosmological constant , namely :    1 .",
    "we can not explain why the cosmological constant is not large .",
    "2 .   we do not know why it is not just equal zero .",
    "we can not explain why energy densities of both dark energy and dark matter , expressed in terms of dimensionless density parameters , are comparable in the current epoch ( cosmic coincidence problem ) .",
    "in our proposition of the explanation of these problems with the cosmological constant parameter , we base on the theories of the cosmological constant in which the vacuum energy is fixed by the fundamental theory @xcite . extending the @xmath0cdm model beyond the classical regime",
    ", we apply quantum mechanics as a fundamental theory , which determines cosmological parameters and explain how cosmological parameters vary during the cosmic evolution .",
    "the cosmological constant is the source of two problems in modern cosmology .",
    "the first problem is the cosmological constant problem , which is consequence of the interpretation of dark energy as a vacuum energy .",
    "the observed present value of the cosmological constant is 120 orders of magnitude smaller than we expect from quantum physics .",
    "the second problem is the coincidence problem .",
    "if we assume that the dark energy is always constant then the @xmath0cdm model can not explain why the cosmological constant has the same order of magnitude as density of matter today .",
    "if the model belongs to the class of running dark energy cosmologies then the first problem of cosmological constant can be solved .",
    "this question seems to be crucial in contemporary physics because its solution would certainly mean a very crucial step forward in our attempts to understand physics from the boundary of particle physics and cosmology .",
    "the discussion about the cosmological constant problem can be found in papers @xcite@xcite .    in our model ,",
    "the influence of running dark energy densities of both visible and invisible matter is very small .",
    "thus we share weinberg s opinion , according to which looking for a solution of the coincidence problem , we should consider the anthropic principle . according to weinberg s argument",
    ", any observers should not be in the universe if the cosmological constant was even three orders of magnitude larger than it is now .",
    "et al_.  @xcite@xcite discussed the instability of a physical system , which is not at an absolute energy minimum , and which is separated from the minimum by an effective potential barrier .",
    "they showed that if the early universe is too cold to activate the energy transition to the minimum energy state then a quantum decay , from the false vacuum to the true vacuum , is still possible through a barrier penetration via the macroscopic quantum tunneling .",
    "the discovery of the higgs - like resonance at 125 - 126 gev @xcite@xcite caused the discussion about the instability of the false vacuum .",
    "if we assume that the standard model well describes the evolution of the universe up to the planck epoch then a higgs mass @xmath16 causes that the electroweak vacuum is in a metastable state @xcite . in consequence",
    "the instability of the higgs vacuum should be considered in the cosmological models of the early time universe .",
    "the idea that properties of the quantum mechanical decay process of metastable states can help to understand the properties of the observed universe was formulated in @xcite .",
    "it is because the decay of the false vacuum is the quantum decay process @xcite .",
    "this means that state vector corresponding to the false vacuum is a quantum unstable ( or metastable ) state .",
    "therefore all general properties of quantum unstable systems must also occur in the case of such a quantum unstable state as the false vacuum and as a consequence models of quantum unstable systems can be used to analyze properties of the systems which time evolution starts from the false vacuum state .    in this paper ,",
    "we assume the breit - wigner energy distribution function , which is very often used to model unstable quantum systems , as a model of the process of the energy transition from the false vacuum to the true vacuum . in consequence the parametrization of the dark energy",
    "is given by formula @xmath17 where @xmath2 and @xmath18 are model parameters describing the variation from the standard cosmological model .",
    "the values of @xmath2 parameter belong to interval @xmath19 .",
    "note that if the @xmath2 parameter or @xmath18 is equal zero than the model is equivalent to the @xmath0cdm model .",

    "we assume that @xmath31 .",
    "the function @xmath32 is called the exponential integral and is defined by the formula : @xmath33 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "as it was mentioned in sec .  1 we will use the parametrization of the dark energy transition from the false vacuum state to the true vacuum state following from the quantum properties of a such process .",
    "this process is a quantum decay process , so we need quantities characterizing decay processes of quantum unstable systems .",
    "the main information about properties of quantum unstable systems is contained in their decay law , that is in their survival probability .",
    "so if one knows that the system is in the initial unstable state @xmath34 , ( @xmath35 is the hilbert space of states of the considered system ) , which was prepared at the initial instant @xmath36 , then one can calculate its survival probability ( the decay law ) , @xmath37 , of the unstable state @xmath38 decaying in vacuum , which equals @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the probability amplitude of finding the system at the time @xmath41 in the rest frame @xmath42 in the initial unstable state @xmath38 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 is the solution of the schrdinger equation for the initial condition @xmath45 , which has the following form @xmath46 here @xmath47 , and @xmath48 denotes the total self - adjoint hamiltonian for the system considered .",

    "so the amplitude @xmath40 , and thus the decay law @xmath37 of the unstable state @xmath38 , are completely determined by the density of the energy distribution @xmath54 for the system in this state @xcite ( see also : @xcite .",

    "this information can be extracted from @xmath40 .",
    "it can be done using the rigorous equation governing the time evolution in the subspace of unstable states , @xmath58 .",
    "such an equation follows from schrdinger equation ( [ schrod ] ) for the total state space @xmath35 .",
    "the use of the schrdinger equation ( [ schrod ] ) allows one to find that within the problem considered @xmath59 this relation leads to the conclusion that the amplitude @xmath40 satisfies the following equation @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 is the effective hamiltonian governing the time evolution in the subspace of unstable states @xmath63 , where @xmath64 ( see @xcite and also @xcite and references therein ) .",

    "there is the following equivalent formula for @xmath62 @xcite : @xmath67    one meets the effective hamiltonian @xmath62 when one starts with the schrdinger equation for the total state space @xmath35 and looks for the rigorous evolution equation for a distinguished subspace of states @xmath68 @xcite . in general @xmath62",

    "this is because within the model defined by the breit - wigner distribution of the energy density , @xmath88 , the expectation value of @xmath48 , that is @xmath103 is not finite .",

    "one finds that for @xmath111 , @xmath115 starting from this asymptotic expression and formula ( [ h(t)-2 ] ) or making use of the asymptotic expansion of @xmath96 @xcite and ( [ i(t)-end1 ] ) , @xmath116 where @xmath117 , one finds , eg . that for @xmath118 , @xmath119 where @xmath120 .",
    "this last relation is valid for @xmath121 , where @xmath122 denotes the cross  over time , ie .",
    "the time when exponential and late time inverse power law contributions to the survival amplitude begin to be comparable .",
    "some cosmological scenario predict the possibility of decay of the standard model vacuum at an inflationary stage of the evolution of the universe ( see eg . @xcite and also @xcite and reference therein ) or earlier . of course this decaying standard model vacuum is described by the quantum state corresponding to a local minimum of the energy density which is not the absolute minimum of the energy density of the system considered ( see , eg .",
    "[ fig : fig15 ] ) .",
    "the scenario in which false vacuum may decay at the inflationary stage of the universe corresponds with the hypothesis analyzed by krauss and dent @xcite .",
    "namely in the mentioned papers the hypothesis that some false vacuum regions do survive well up to the cross  over time @xmath122 or later was considered where @xmath122 is the same cross  over time which is is considered within the theory of evolving in time quantum unstable systems .",
    "the fact that the decay of the false vacuum is the quantum decay process means that state vector corresponding to the false vacuum is a quantum unstable ( or metastable ) state .",
    "therefore all the general properties of quantum unstable systems must also occur in the case of such a quantum unstable state as the false vacuum .",
    "this applies in particular to such properties as late time deviations from the exponential decay law and properties of the energy @xmath123 of the system in the quantum false vacuum state at late times @xmath121 : in @xcite it was pointed out the energy of those false vacuum regions which survived up to @xmath122 and much later differs from @xmath124 @xcite .",
    "so within the cosmological scenario in which the decay of false vacuum is assumed the unstable state @xmath38 corresponds with the false vacuum state : @xmath125 .",
    "then @xmath126 is the true vacuum state , that is the state corresponding to the true minimal energy .",
    "in such a case @xmath127 is the energy of a state corresponding to the false vacuum measured at the canonical decay time ( the exponential decay regime ) and @xmath128 is the energy of true vacuum ( i.e. , the true ground state of the system ) , so @xmath129 .",

    "states @xmath130 and @xmath126 correspond to the local minimum and to the true lowest minimum of the potential @xmath131 of the scalar field @xmath132 respectively . ,",

    "the jump down mechanism is independent from the parameter @xmath2 value , which leads to to solving the cosmological constant problem .    in the early universe",
    "the energy density of dark energy is significantly lower than the energy density of dark matter , therefore the change of energy density of the dark matter , which is caused by energy transfer in the dark sector , is negligible .    while our model explains the cosmological constant problem , the coincidence problem is still open as we forced the model to have an exit on the present value of the cosmological constant . in the early universe , the dark energy oscillates .",
    "but the amplitude of oscillations decreases with time . in consequence for the late time universe , oscillations are negligible and the dark energy can be described as the cosmological constant . unfortunately our model can not explain why the present value of dark energy and matter are comparable .    from the statistical analysis of the model we found that the model is generic in the sense",
    "that independently of the values of the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath267 we can obtain the present value of the energy density of the dark energy .",
    "therefore , the @xmath0cdm model is an attractor which the all models with different values of parameters @xmath2 and @xmath267 can reach at .",
