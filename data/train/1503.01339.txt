    "the detection of significant differences in the galaxy populations between clusters and field dates back to @xcite , who noted that `` the predominance of early types is a conspicuous feature of clusters in general '' .",
    "twenty years later , the prevalence in clusters of stellar population ii galaxies ( early types , mainly s0s ) was interpreted by @xcite as due to galaxy collisions in the dense cluster environment .",
    "attempts to classify clusters according to the galaxy morphological composition were subsequently made by @xcite and @xcite .    yet , the first quantitative assessment of the relation between galaxy morphology and environment was provided by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* d80 hereafter ) , based on photographic plates of 55 rich galaxy clusters , obtained using the las campanas 2.5 m and the kitt peak 4 m telescopes .",
    "indeed , it was after this classical paper that the relation between the local projected density of galaxies in the sky ( computed using the 10 nearest neighbours ; @xmath6 hereafter ) and the fraction of galaxies of different morphological types ( the morphology - density relation ; @xmath0-@xmath1 hereafter ) began to be considered among the most important empirical evidences of extragalactic astronomy .",
    "in particular , the d80 finding that the @xmath0-@xmath1 relation holds in both structurally regular ( dynamically `` relaxed '' ? ) and irregular ( clumpy , `` non relaxed '' ) nearby clusters and its rapid extention to the group and general field environments @xcite , led the astronomical community to consider this relation a sort of universal rule in the extragalactic astronomy .",
    "indeed , the fact that early - type galaxies ( es and s0s ; etgs hereafter ) preferentially dominate dense environments , while late - type galaxies ( spirals and irregulars ; ltgs hereafter ) are more common in low - density regions has progressively become an out - and - out paradigm with which to reckon when dealing with problems related to the evolution of galaxies , from both the phenomenological and theoretical side .",
    "for instance , @xcite explored a model in which galaxy morphology is intrinsically related to the peak height of the initial fluctuations in a cdm universe , finding good agreement with d80 for the @xmath0-@xmath1 relation of es .",
    "besides the existence of the @xmath0-@xmath1 relation in galaxy clusters , in d80 it is also claimed that this relation is much stronger than the relation between morphology and cluster - centric distance ( morphology - radius relation ; @xmath0-@xmath2 hereafter ) .",
    "however , a different viewpoint was proposed by @xcite , who re - examined the d80 data , finding that the strengths of the @xmath0-@xmath2 and @xmath0-@xmath1 relations are comparable .",
    "they also suggested that the physical mechanisms driving the gradients for es are different from those operating for spirals and s0s .",
    "@xcite examined again the d80 sample concluding that the @xmath0-@xmath2 , normalized to a characteristic radius ( r@xmath7 ) , is the fundamental relation driving the morphological fractions of all types , from spiral galaxies ( slightly decreasing toward the center , then going close to zero near the center ) , to s0s ( moderately increasing toward the center for r / r@xmath80.2 , then sharply falling down ) and es ( from 10% in the outer regions to @xmath916% at r / r@xmath101 , then rapidly increasing up to 60 - 70% in the inner regions ) .",
    "moreover , @xcite analysed compact and loose groups and the field , finding that the @xmath0-@xmath1 is not present in these environments , just strongly rising near the center of clusters .",
    "the whitmore & gilmore s viewpoint about the prevalence of the @xmath0-@xmath2 over the @xmath0-@xmath1 relation in determining the morphological fractions in clusters was almost bailed out after the @xmath0-@xmath1 relation was proved by the morphs group ( * ? ? ?",
    "* d97 hereafter ) to hold also for intermediate redshift clusters ( @xmath110.5 ; see also * ? ? ?",
    "* in the redshift range 0.10.25 ) . in this redshift range",
    ", however , the relation is found very weak or even absent for irregular clusters .",
    "moreover , we mention that @xcite claimed the cluster - centric distance to be the driving parameter of the etg fraction in the inner part of the cluster cl  0024@xmath1216 at @xmath110.4 .    although structure and morphology are intrinsically different properties , thus making dangerous to compare visual @xmath0-@xmath1 ( morphology ) at low @xmath13 with structural @xmath0-@xmath1 ( sersic index ) at high @xmath13 @xcite , in the subsequent decade several authors studied the @xmath0-@xmath1 relation in different ranges of redshift and stellar mass .",
    "most of them agreed that : @xmath14 the @xmath0-@xmath1 is already in place , although in a less strong fashion @xcite , at @xmath110.5 , both in groups and ( possibly from @xmath111 ) in clusters @xcite ; @xmath15 the evolution of morphological fractions strongly depends on galaxy mass @xcite ; @xmath16 in dense environments the etgs dominate at all redshifts and their fraction increases over time @xcite , mostly because of the growing fraction of s0s @xcite ; @xmath17 the evolution of the @xmath0-@xmath1 relation turns out to be less strong for mass limited than for magnitude limited samples @xcite .",
    "besides the @xmath0-@xmath1 dependence on redshift , some papers have also analysed the morphological fractions as a function of the global cluster properties . in particular",
    ", @xcite found a mild dependence of the morphological fractions on the cluster velocity dispersion , while the growth of the spiral / s0 fraction with redshift was found by @xcite to be stronger for low mass than for high mass clusters .",
    "a specific effect of the cluster environment on the spiral / s0 fraction is claimed by @xcite , based on the sharp enhancement / dearth of s0s / late - types found in clusters at decreasing redshift , compared to other environments ( single galaxies , binary systems , poor / rich groups ) .",
    "a totally different and innovative approach to the @xmath0-@xmath1 has been proposed with the _ kinematic _ morphology - density relation by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper vii of the atlas3d collaboration ) . rather than",
    "rely on the visual morphology , they classify galaxies according to their stellar kinematics , dividing etgs into slow- and fast - rotators ( instead of es and s0s ) . in this way and adopting a very local density estimator , computed just using the 3 nearest neighbours ( the atlas3d galaxies mainly inhabit low - density environments ) , they found a @xmath0-@xmath1 cleaner than using classic morphology .",
    "they interpret this improvement as due to the fact that many fast - rotators , visually classified es are actually face - on , misclassified s0s .",

    "exploiting the large and coherent database provided by the wings project , we revisit here the @xmath0-@xmath1 and @xmath0-@xmath2 relations in galaxy clusters of the local universe .",
    "in particular , thanks to the large galaxy sample , we are in the position of testing how these relations behave in different ranges of cluster - centric distance ( for @xmath0-@xmath1 ) and local density ( for @xmath0-@xmath2 ) , as well as for galaxies in different stellar mass ranges and for different global cluster properties . in section  [ sec2 ]",
    "we describe the cluster and galaxy samples . in section  [ sec3 ]",
    "we give detailed information about the data used to perform the analysis . the procedure used to account for and remove field galaxies",
    "is described in section  [ sec4 ] .",
    "section  [ sec5 ] and appendix  [ app1 ] are devoted to characterize the issue related to the limited cluster area coverage of the wings imaging and to investigate the effect of such an issue on the results we obtain for the @xmath0-@xmath1 and @xmath0-@xmath2 relations .",
    "these results are presented in sections  [ sec6 ] .",
    "in particular , in sections  [ sec6c ] and [ sec6d ] we investigate how @xmath0-@xmath1 and @xmath0-@xmath2 depend on the global cluster properties and on the galaxy stellar mass , respectively . in section  [ sec7 ]",
    "we summarize our results and try to outline possible scenarios able to interpret them .    throughout the paper",
    "we adopt a flat geometry of the universe with the following cosmology : @xmath19=70  kms@xmath20mpc@xmath20 , @xmath21=0.3 and @xmath22=0.7 .",
    "the galaxies used for the present analysis are located in the fields of 75 clusters belonging to the wings - opt survey ( see table  5 in f06 ) .",
    "the cluster a3164 has been excluded , due to the poor psf quality which prevented us from obtaining a reliable morphological classification .",
    "moreover , when performing the analysis of the @xmath0-@xmath2 relation , we excluded the galaxies in the field of clusters a311 , a2665 and zwcl1261 .",
    "in fact , for these clusters we do not have a redshift coverage sufficient to allow a reliable estimation of the velocity dispersion , which is needed to compute the characteristic cluster radius r@xmath23 ( as defined in sec .",
    "[ sec3c ] ) and normalize the distance of galaxies from the cluster center .      our starting sample of galaxies roughly concides with that illustrated in f12 .",
    "more precisely , the morphot catalog of 39,923 wings galaxies has been cross - matched with the catalog of structural parameters obtained running gasphot onto the v - band wings imaging @xcite .",
    "this catalog provides apparent total magnitudes and structural parameters of galaxies .",
    "the apparent magnitudes have been corrected for galactic extinction using the maps in @xcite .",
    "the galaxies for which the sersic index derived by gasphot turned out to coincide with the boundary values of the allowed search interval ( 0.58 ) have been excluded from the database .",
    "in fact , in these cases we assume that a failure of the gasphot fitting occurred , thus preventing us from relying on the output gasphot parameters . for the resulting sample of 39,304 objects ,",
    "putting together the data from wings - spe @xcite and from the literature , we gathered spectroscopic redshifts of 9,361 galaxies , of which 6,297 are cluster members .",
    "the absolute magnitudes of all galaxies in our sample , but the spectroscopic non - members , are computed using the average redshifts of clusters given in @xcite and the cosmology given in section  [ secintro ] .",
    "they are k  corrected using the tables in @xcite and according to the morphological types provided by morphot ( see section  [ sec3a ] ) .    when comparing our results with those reported in the literature , we will mainly advert to d80 and d97 , which still remain the most important and cited references on this subject . after accounting for the different waveband and cosmology , the absolute v - band magnitude limits ( m@xmath24 ) given in these papers for the galaxy samples are @xmath2519.67 and @xmath2519.17 , respectively .",
    "we adopt m@xmath2619.5 , which is also close to the value used for the enacs sample by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; m@xmath2619.57 ) .",
    "in this way , we are left with the final reference sample of 5,504 galaxies , of which 82% have measured redshift and 67% are cluster members .    throughout the paper , alternative sample partitions and selection criteria will be tested , so that the actual sample size might vary from time to time , also depending on the expected field counts relative to the particular selection . for this reason , we usually report each time in the following tables the proper sample sizes before the field removal .",
    "finally , the same above mentioned limit of luminosity ( m@xmath2619.5 ) is adopted for neighbour galaxies in the computation of the local densities ( section  [ sec3b ] ) .",
    "all quantities we describe in the followings sub - secions and we use in the following analysis can be easily retrieved , through the virtual observatory tools , following the recommendations given in @xcite .",
    "the morphological types of galaxies are taken from the database of wings galaxies at :    .",
    "this database has been obtained running morphot ( f12 ) on the v - band wings - opt imaging of galaxies with isophotal area larger than 200 pixels at the threshold of 2.5@xmath27 ( where @xmath27 is the standard deviation of the background ) .",
    "it is worth noticing that none of the wings - opt galaxies with m@xmath2819.5 has been removed from the final sample because of the 200 pixels cutoff adopted by morphot .",
    "this means that our absolute magnitude limited sample is safe from surface brightness incompleteness ( very compact galaxies ) .",
    "morphot is an automatic tool purposely devised to obtain morphological type estimates of galaxies in the wings survey .",
    "it combines a large set of diagnostics of morphology , easily computable from the digital cutouts of galaxies .",
    "morphot produces two independent estimates of the morphological type based on : ( i ) a semi - analytical maximum likelihood technique ; ( ii ) a neural network machine .",
    "the final estimator has proven to be almost as effective as the visual classification .",
    "in particular , it has been shown to be able to distinguish between ellipticals and s0 galaxies with unprecedented accuracy ( see fig .  11 in f12 ) .",
    "the morphot estimator ( mtype in the database ) is almost coincident with the revised hubble type defined by ( * ? ?",
    "* see table  1 in f12 ) . for the purposes in the present paper",
    "it is convenient to split the galaxy sample in three broad morphological types : ( i ) ellipticals ( e ) ; ( ii ) lenticulars ( s0 ) ; ( iii ) spirals ( sp ) . with this convention",
    ", the ( few ) irregular galaxies in our sample are included in the sp class and the cd galaxies are included in the e class .    using a sample of 176 common galaxies belonging to 18 common clusters ,",
    "we have compared the broad morphological type ( es / s0s / spirals ) provided by morphot with the corresponding classifications given in d80 .",
    "the agreement turned out to be quite good for spirals ( discrepancy of 2% ) , while for es and s0s we found a discrepancy of @xmath920% , mainly in the sense of an excess of elliptical galaxies in the morphot classifications with respect to the d80 ones .",
    "the most obvious explanation of such discrepancy is that it originates from the different material used to inspect clusters : photographic plates in the original paper of d80 and ccd imaging in the wings survey .",
    "for this reason , one of us ( ad , indeed ! ) has visually ( and blindly ) re - classified 25 discordant objects using the wings observing material ( ccd ) . with the new ad classifications the discrepancy turned out to be reduced down to a physiological amount ( @xmath96% ) .      the projected local galaxy density relative to a given galaxy is commonly defined as the number of neighbours ( @xmath29)of the galaxy per square megaparsec . according to the prescriptions given in d80",
    ", we compute the projected local densities using the 10 nearest neighbours of the galaxy with m@xmath2819.5 . at variance with d80",
    ", we use a circle ( rather than a rectangle ) to compute the area including the 10 nearest neighbours .",
    "that is : @xmath30 , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the radius ( in mpc ) of the smallest circle centered on the galaxy and including the 10 nearest neighbours .",
    "numerical simulations have shown that using the circular area produces a negligible ( @xmath90.03 ) downward shift of log@xmath6 with respect to the values computed using the rectangular area .    in order to perform the correction for field contamination , rather than our incomplete membership information",
    ", we prefer to use a statistical correction based on the field counts provided by @xcite using the deep eso - spitzer wide - area imaging survey ( esis ) .",
    "in particular , we compute for each cluster the number of field galaxies per @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) up to the apparent magnitude corresponding to m@xmath2619.5 at the cluster redshift .",
    "moreover , in counting the neighbours within a circle centered on a given galaxy , we statistically account for the objects possibly lost because of the proximity of the galaxy to the edges of the fied of view ( including the gaps between the chips ) .",
    "we do this dividing the counts by the ratio @xmath35 ( @xmath361 ) between the area actually covered by the detector and the circular area .",
    "starting from the nearest neighbour ( i=1 ) and progressively including the next nearest one ( i = i+1 ) , we compute each time the circular area @xmath37 ( in @xmath33 ) relative to the neighbour distance and the corresponding number of neighbours : @xmath38 .",
    "when @xmath39 overcomes 10 , the final area @xmath40 is computed interpolating between @xmath37 and @xmath41 .    for 24 clusters in common with sdss - dr7 ,",
    "we complement our positional and photometric database with sdss information .",
    "in particular , we use the relations in @xcite to get the v - band magnitudes of sdss galaxies from the @xmath42 and @xmath43 ones . for this galaxy sample",
    "we are allowed to obtain complete coverages within @xmath40 even for galaxies close to the frame borders , thus being able to compute the @xmath6 values ( @xmath44 ) without correcting for the coverage fraction ( @xmath35=1 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] illustrates how the difference between the @xmath6 values obtained with and without sdss information depend on the coverage fraction .",
    "it is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] that for small values of @xmath35 the statistical correction tends to produce an overestimation of @xmath6 .",
    "this is likely due to the negative outward density gradient in clusters , which makes the real number of galaxies lost because of the proximity to the frame edges , lower than the number obtained correcting with @xmath35 , _",
    "i.e. _ assuming a uniform density inside the circles .",
    "for this reason the local densities of galaxies for which no sdss information is available , have been statistically corrected using the best - fit relation illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] : log@xmath45=log@xmath6 + 0.178  ( @xmath35 - 1 ) .",
    "we derive two different cluster - centric distances ( @xmath2 ) , depending on the choice of the cluster center .",
    "the first one ( @xmath46 ) assumes the brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) as cluster center , while the second one assumes the center of the cluster to coincide with the maximum intensity of the x - ray emission . in any case",
    ", the cluster - centric distances have to be normalized to some characteristic cluster size .",
    "one class of size estimates is based on top - hat filtered spherical overdensities . in this model",
    ", clusters are expected to be virialized within regions where the enclosed mean mass density exceeds the critical density by a factor 200 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and 15 , respectively ) .",
    "we assume the radius at which this overdensity is reached , r@xmath23 , as the characteristic radius of the cluster .",
    "the r@xmath23 values for our clusters are computed from the wings cluster velocity dispersions ( @xmath47 ) given in @xcite , using the formula @xcite :    @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , in each cluster , the cluster - centric distances of galaxies ( @xmath2 ) , to be used in the following analyses , have been obtained dividing the distance in mpc by the proper value of r@xmath23 .    in figure  [ figmap ]",
    "we illustrate , as an example , the map of the cluster abell  1668 , obtained using the photometric data from the wings - opt catalog and the morphologies provided by morphot ( see the figure caption for details about symbols ) .",
    "similar maps of all wings clusters ( 76 ) are available in the online material ( see the electronic version of the paper ) .",
    "in order to obtain reliable @xmath0-@xmath1 and @xmath0-@xmath2 relations in nearby clusters , it is important to properly remove the contribution of field galaxies ( mostly background ) in each broad morphological class ( e / s0/sp ) .",
    "the percentages of field galaxies in each class have been estimated using the padova - millennium galaxy and group catalogue ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* pm2gc ) , consisting of a spectroscopically complete sample of galaxies at 0.03@xmath490.11 brighter than m@xmath5018.7 .",
    "this sample is sourced from the millennium galaxy catalogue @xcite , a b - band contiguous equatorial survey , complete down to b=20 and representative of the general field population in the local universe .",
    "the advantage of using pm2gc data is that both the instrumental set up of the imaging ( wfc@int ) and the tool used to estimate the morphological types ( morphot ) are the same for both pm2gc and wings galaxies .",
    "this guarantees a full morphological consistency between the two samples .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] reports the morphological fractions of the pm2gc galaxy sample in different bins of apparent magnitude . even if the expected increase of the e fraction and decrease of the sp fractions are clearly detectable , fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows that the percentages e / s0/sp depends weakly on the apparent magnitude . in our analysis",
    "we assume e / s0/sp = 19.3(@xmath513.1)%/21.7(@xmath512.7)%/59(@xmath515.3)% .",
    "these values correspond to the morphological fractions of pm2gc galaxies with v@xmath3617.77 , this limit including 95% of the wings galaxies in our reference sample ( see below ) .    in figure  [ fig3 ] the global field counts in the v - band from the pm2gc galaxy sample",
    "are compared with the counts given by @xcite in the same waveband and in the magnitude range of interest for us .",
    "the slight systematic excess of the pm2gc counts for bright galaxies with respect to the counts by @xcite is likely due to the presence in the pm2gc field of many galaxy groups , which , because of the criteria adopted in the choice of the field , are probably lacking in the esis database used by @xcite . on the other hand , the sharp decline of the pm2gc counts towards faint galaxies clearly reveals the incompleteness of the pm2gc galaxy sample for which a morphological classification has been possible through morphot ( isophotal area larger than 200 pixels at the threshold of 2.5@xmath27 ) .",
    "nevertheless , it is noticeable that the two counts curves assume roughly the same value ( 1.51 , that is @xmath932 galaxies per square degree ) at v@xmath3617.77 , which is the value chosen above to compute our morphological fractions .",
    "all things considered , the statistical counts of field galaxies suggest us to remove in our analyses 32 galaxies per square degree , in particular : 6  es ( 19.3% ) , 7  s0s ( 21.7% ) and 19  spirals ( 59% ) .",
    "according to section  [ sec2b ] , in our galaxy sample the global spectroscopic coverage and cluster membership , up to the adopted limit of absolute v - band magnitude ( @xmath2519.5 ) , are 82% and 67% , respectively .",
    "these rather high percentages allowed us to deal with the problem of field galaxies using a strategy complementing the statistical field counts with the membership information . in particular , we first removed from the sample those galaxies which , according to the redshift information and the membership criteria described in @xcite , are not cluster members .",
    "then , if the number of galaxies removed from each broad morphological class ( es / s0s / sp ) turned out to be lower than the expected field counts relative to that class , we further subtracted from the residual the quantity needed to reach the field counts expected from @xcite . in this way",
    ", it might happen that the actual number of removed galaxies exceeds the number expected from the field counts . in any case",
    ", we have verified that the differences between the @xmath0-@xmath1 relations obtained using our mixed strategy and a ` pure ' statistical approach are practically negligible .",
    "having at our disposal a large galaxy sample in a well defined , complete cluster sample , our strength lies in the opportunity to take advantage of a good statistics . for this reason , in the present analysis we mostly use galaxies in the whole cluster sample . at times , however , in order to perform some particular analysis , we use galaxies belonging to a sub - sample of clusters ( selected , for instance , on the basis of x - ray emission , velocity dispersion or subclustering ) , or galaxies obeying some constraint ( for instance on the stellar mass ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "our weakness lies in the limited and not always regular cluster area covered by the wings images .",
    "the upper panel of figure  [ fig4 ] shows that , for r@xmath52=0.5 , 0.75 and 1.0 , the wings images cover more than 90% of the circular ( bcg centered ) area in just @xmath966% , 28% and 2% of the clusters , respectively , while a coverage fraction ( cf hereafter ) of 0.75 at the same radii is reached in @xmath985% , 50% and 11% of the clusters .",
    "similar cfs are found if we assume the cluster centers to coincide with the maximum intensity of the x - ray emission . an alternative way to illustrate the coverage problem",
    "is provided by the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . in this panel",
    "the solid line reports the fraction of wings clusters whose equivalent radius r@xmath53 ( @xmath54 being the area covered by the wings images in units of r@xmath55 ) exceedes the value of @xmath46 reported in the abscissa , while the dashed line ( red in the electronic version ) reports the fraction of wings clusters for which the galaxy with the largest clustercentric distance has a @xmath46 exceeding the value given in the abscissa .    even if one of the goals of the present paper is the analysis of the morphological fractions as a function of the clustercentric distrance ( @xmath0-@xmath2 ) , from previous studies we know that the spiral fraction inside a given ( bgc or x - ray centered ) cluster area is an increasing function of the radius .",
    "thus , the limited cluster area coverage of the wings images in comparison with other analyses ( _ e.g. : _ d80 ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is expected to result in a reduced global fraction of spirals .    besides this obvious effect",
    ", additional biases due to the limited cluster area coverage of our data could affect the @xmath0-@xmath2 and @xmath0-@xmath1 relations we present here .    concerning the first relation ( @xmath0-@xmath2 )",
    ", there is no reason to believe that any galaxy included in our sample , with clustercentric distance ( @xmath2 ) not completely covered by our imaging , should be drawn from a morphological distribution different from the average distribution at that @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath0-@xmath2 should be unaffected by both the limited cluster area coverage of our images , and their irregular shape ( for int imaging , in particular ) . for the @xmath0-@xmath2",
    ", the above issues should just translate into a limited extension of the relation and a relatively large poissonian uncertainty of its outer part .    trying to quantify the possible biases affecting the @xmath0-@xmath1 relation because of the limited cluster area coverage of our imaging , in appendix  [ app1 ] we present three different tests .",
    "the first two tests investigate the effects on @xmath0-@xmath1 of two different issues : the irregular shape of wings images and their limited coverage of the cluster area .",
    "the third test , performed through quite simple numerical simulations , is again aimed at investigating the effect of the limited cluster coverage on the @xmath0-@xmath1 in different ranges of clustercentric distance . moreover , since the simulations require some hypothesis about the driving parameter ( @xmath1 or @xmath2 ) of the morphological fractions , they could also provide useful indication with regards to such parameter ( see section  [ app1c ] in appendix  [ app1 ] ) .",
    "in fig .  [ fig4 ] we have shown that , due to the limited field of view of the cameras used in the wings optical survey , the cluster area coverage of our cluster images turns out to be relatively small . as expected , this makes the global morphological content of our galaxy sample quite different from that reported in previous analyses which made use of much larger field of view imaging . in particular , we find e / s0/sp@xmath933%/44%/23% ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* and @xcite , with a slightly different sample selection ) , to be compared with the morphological fractions given by d80 ( @xmath918%/41%/41% ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath919%/47%/34% ) .",
    "it is worth stressing that , supported by the comparison between the morphot and d80 morphological classifications ( see section  [ sec3a ] ) , we entirely attribute to the limited cluster area coverage of the wings imaging the above discrepancy of global morphological fractions .",
    "let s now indicate with @xmath56/@xmath57/@xmath58=0.193/0.217/0.59 the morphological fractions we have previously found for field galaxies , and with @xmath59 and @xmath60 the total number of galaxies and of field galaxies relative to the particular selection ( of clusters and/or galaxies and/or range of @xmath2 or @xmath6 ) we are testing in the analysis of the @xmath0-@xmath1 and @xmath0-@xmath2 relations . for each bin ( @xmath61 ) of log@xmath6 or @xmath46 and for each broad morphological type ( t = e / s0/sp ) , we compute the morphological fractions as :      in these expressions , the symbols @xmath63 and @xmath64 indicate galaxy numbers and fractions , respectively . in particular , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the total number of galaxies and the number of galaxies with broad morphological type t in the @xmath67 bin , while we indicate with @xmath68 the product @xmath69 and with @xmath70 the fraction @xmath71 . in the above formulation of @xmath72",

    "the correlations are very strong in both cases , as indicated by the coefficients @xmath75cc and @xmath75slope , while the ks(e - sp ) probability indicates that es and spirals are quite distinct from each other .",
    "it is also worth noticing that the fraction of s0s seems not to depend at all on the local density , as found also by d97 .",
    "in addition , the ks analysis suggests that the s0s constitute a population well distinct from both es and spirals . the first row of table  [ tabres ] ( columns 2 , 3 and 4 ) reports the values of the coefficients , together with their r.m.s uncertainties .",
    "let s now check out whether and how the @xmath0-@xmath1 relation depends on the position of the galaxy inside the cluster , in particular on the clustercentric distance relative to the bcg ( @xmath46 ) .",

    "the left panel of the figure refers to the central region of the clusters ( @xmath760.5 ) , while the right panel refers to the @xmath46 interval ( 0.51 ) .",
    "it stands out that , while in the central part of the cluster the @xmath0-@xmath1 is quite strong , when moving outside it seems to become very weak or even absent .",
    "this is formally confirmed by the @xmath75cc and @xmath75slope values , as well as by the 2s - ks probabilities obtained in the two @xmath46 intervals .",
    "these values are reported in table  [ tabres ] ( rows 2 and 3 ; columns 2 , 3 and 4 ) .",
    "table  [ tabres ] also reports , in rows 4 , 5 and 6 ( columns 2 , 3 and 4 ) , the results we obtain splitting the @xmath46 interval ( 01 ) into three parts , while in the row 7 we report the data relative to the @xmath46 interval ( 0.331 ) , which we refer to in figure  [ fig9 ] .",
    "table  [ tabres ] clearly shows that the region where the @xmath0-@xmath1 actually operates is the very inner cluster region ( @xmath761/3 ) .",
    "the high significance found for the @xmath0-@xmath1 for the whole galaxy sample ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) is just due to the fact that the inner regions are the most densely populated in the clusters .",
    "table  [ tabcf ] is similar to table  [ tabres ] , but it reports the results for just the @xmath0-@xmath1 and for two different values of the minimum allowed coverage fraction ( cf@xmath770.5 and cf@xmath770.75 ) .",
    "more precisely , to assume for instance cf@xmath770.5 , means that just galaxies in clusters whose cf in the considered range of @xmath46 is greater than 0.5 are each time included in the sample .",
    "this obviously reduces the number of employed galaxies , but makes the @xmath0-@xmath1 relation more robust against the cf issue . from the comparison between tables  [ tabres ] and [ tabcf ]",
    "we conclude again that the limited cluster area coverage of the images does not invalidate the conclusion reported in sec .",

    "the dark and light histograms refer to the h@xmath2 and h@xmath6 hypotheses , respectively.,width=377 ]    finally , we use two different sets of numerical simulations to investigate the effect of the limited cluster area coverage on the @xmath0-@xmath1 in different ranges of the clustercentric distance . in order to perform the simulations we have to assume some dependence of the morphological fractions on either @xmath2 or @xmath6 ( or even on both ) .",
    "therefore , these simulations can also be used , in principle , to test which one of the two ( or three ) hypotheses is able to reproduce the observed @xmath0-@xmath1 and @xmath0-@xmath2 relations .",
    "the first set ( simulation set 1 : ss1 ) totally ignores the physics of the clusters .",
    "it simply produces artificial samples of points with random polar angles ( circular symmetry ) and radial coordinates randomly extracted from a distribution suitably chosen in order to reproduce the @xmath46log@xmath6 relation observed in the wings galaxy sample .",
    "once the @xmath6 values of the simulated points have been computed in the usual way , the artificial sample is randomly thined out following a depletion law depending on the radial coordinate and suitably chosen in order to reproduce the variation of the total number density of the wings sample as a function of @xmath46 .",
    "this procedure should properly account for the incompleteness of the real sample due to both the irregular image shape and the limited coverage fraction .",
    "however , the lack of physics , in particular of gravitational clustering ( 2-point or 3-point correlation function ) , makes the scatter of @xmath6 in the simulated @xmath2log@xmath6 relations lower than in the real sample of wings galaxies .",
    "we compensate this lack of physics through an additional scatter on @xmath6 , tuned on the observed @xmath2log@xmath6 relation and depending on the radial coordinate .",
    "then , we consider the two alternative hypothesis that the morphological fractions ( @xmath78 and @xmath79 ) depend either just on @xmath6 ( hypothesis @xmath6 : h@xmath6 ) or just on @xmath2 ( h@xmath2 ) .",
    "we assume in the two cases the probability that the points in our simulated samples were elliptical or spiral galaxies to coincide with the weighted linear fits of the relations in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] [ @xmath78(@xmath6 ) and @xmath79(@xmath6 ) ] or in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] [ @xmath78(@xmath46 ) and @xmath79(@xmath46 ) ] , respectively .",
    "they are :          in the second set of simulations ( ss2 ) we adopt the same procedure to randomly assign the morphological type , but we use the real sample of wings galaxies to take the ( measured ) values of @xmath6 and @xmath2 .    for both kinds of simulations ( ss1 and ss2 ) and for each hypothesis about the dependence of the morphological fractions ( h@xmath6 , h@xmath2 , hmix ) , we make several throws , each throw producing @xmath0-@xmath1 and @xmath0-@xmath2 relations similar to those illustrated in figures  [ fig5],[fig6],[fig7],[fig8 ] ( @xmath2 intervals : 01 , 00.5 , 0.51 ; log@xmath6 intervals : 03 , 01.45 , 1.453 ) , with the same number of points ( galaxies ) .",
    "moreover , for each throw we record the values of the coefficients @xmath75cc and @xmath75slope defined in sec .",
    "[ sec6a ] .",
    "finally , in each case , we compare the distributions of @xmath75cc and @xmath75slope with the corresponding values obtained for the real sample of wings galaxies ( see the previously mentioned figures ) . in this way , for both ss1 and ss2 , we can associate to each hypothesis ( h@xmath6 , h@xmath2 , hmix ) and for both the @xmath0-@xmath1 and @xmath0-@xmath2 relations ( in the corresponding intervals of @xmath2 and @xmath6 , respectively ) a set of deviates of the observed coefficients @xmath75cc and @xmath75slope ( ccdev and sldev ; both in r.m.s .",
    "units ) with respect to the corresponding distributions , as well as a set of probabilities ( p@xmath83 and p@xmath84 ) that these coefficients are extracted from the distributions themselves .",
    "tables  [ tabss1 ] and [ tabss2 ] illustrate the results obtained for the two sets of simulations ( ss1 and ss2 , respectively ) .",
    "for each hypothesis ( h@xmath6 , h@xmath2 , hmix ) , the tables report the deviates and the probabilities of the coefficients @xmath75cc and @xmath75slope of the observed @xmath0-@xmath1 and @xmath0-@xmath2 relations for different intervals of @xmath2 and log@xmath6 , respectively .",
    "they are computed comparing each coefficient with the corresponding , proper distribution obtained from the simulations .",
    "it should be noted that , due to the rather cumbersome ( and cpu time consuming ) procedure needed to produce a single ss1 sample , the number of throws used to obtain the distributions of coefficients ccdev , p@xmath83 , sldev and p@xmath84 is almost one order of magnitude smaller for ss1 ( n@xmath85=100@xmath86200 ) than for ss2 ( n@xmath85=1000 ) .",
    "this fact , together with the use of the real wings quantities ( @xmath6 and @xmath46 ) in ss2 , suggests that the robustness of the results is greater for ss2 than for ss1 . in both table",
    "[ tabss1 ] and table  [ tabss2 ] we report in boldface those values of ccdev and sldev larger than 3 , as well as those values of p@xmath83 and p@xmath84 lower that 0.05 .",
    "moreover , we mark with one or two asterisks those values of p@xmath83 and p@xmath84 equal to or less than 0.01 , respectively .    in spite of the quite rough procedure used to generate the simulated samples in the ss1 and to attribute the morphological type to each simulated point ( in both ss1 and ss2 ) ,",
    "tables  [ tabss1 ] and [ tabss2 ] provide us with some indication about the driving parameter of the morphological fractions in clusters :    _ ( i ) _ the canonical hyphotesis that the morphological fractions in clusters just depend on the local density ( h@xmath6 ) is not able to reproduce the observed @xmath0-@xmath2 relation , either for the whole sample , and for the two @xmath6 intervals .",
    "this is particularly evident in table  [ tabss2 ] ;    _ ( ii ) _ although specifically built to obey the observed morphology - density relation , the h@xmath6 simulations just marginally reproduce the very @xmath0-@xmath1 relation in the outer part of clusters ( @xmath2 interval : 0.51 ) , usually producing much steeper and more correlated distributions than the observed one ( see light histograms in figure  [ figa2 ] ) .",
    "while for ss1 this might be thougth as a consequence of the quite regular shape of the simulated clusters ( see section  [ sec6c2 ] ) , such an explanation is ruled out by ss2 , where the observed wings quantities ( @xmath6 and @xmath46 ) have been used ;    _ ( iii ) _ on the contrary , the alternative hyphotesis that the morphological fractions in clusters just depend on the clustercentric distance ( h@xmath2 ) quite well reproduces both the @xmath0-@xmath2 relation ( in any @xmath6 interval ) and the @xmath0-@xmath1 relations in the outer cluster regions ( see dark histograms in figure  [ figa2 ] ) , but it seems to fail in reproducing the @xmath0-@xmath1 in the inner cluster regions .",
    "this is particularly true for the ss1 ( table  [ tabss1 ] ) ;    _ ( iv ) _ the mixed hypothesis that the morphological fractions actually depend on both @xmath6 and @xmath2 ( hmix ) turns out to be fairly consistent with all observed @xmath0-@xmath1 and @xmath0-@xmath2 relations , but ( perhaps ) the @xmath0-@xmath2 in the full log@xmath6 interval ( 03 ) .",
    "the above remarks seem to favour the h@xmath2 hypothesis with respect to the classical h@xmath6 scenario , although this result might critically depend on the simulation procedure and might be modified , for instance , by a different ( not linear ) representation of the relations @xmath78(@xmath6 ) , @xmath79(@xmath6 ) , @xmath78(@xmath2 ) and @xmath79(@xmath2 ) .",
