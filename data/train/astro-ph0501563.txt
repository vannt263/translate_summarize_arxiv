    "the last decade has revealed remarkable diversity in the young neutron star population : radio pulsars , soft @xmath3-ray repeaters ( sgrs ) , anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) and central compact objects ( ccos ) are all now known to be potential compact remnants of core - collapse supernovae ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "while the ccos remain enigmatic , the axps and sgrs are now both believed to be populations of `` magnetars '' , neutron stars whose persistent x - ray emission and occasional x- and @xmath3-ray bursts are powered by the energy associated with extreme surface magnetic fields , @xmath4  g ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "the low galactic latitudes and the associations of some of these sources with supernova remnants ( snrs ) make it clear that magnetars are young neutron stars @xcite .",
    "however , what is not clear is why some neutron stars are `` normal '' radio pulsars , while others are x- and @xmath3-ray emitting magnetars .",
    "the physical distinction can not simply be the strength of the dipole magnetic field , since there is now a small population of radio pulsars whose dipole field strengths ( as inferred from their spin down ) are at magnetar - like levels , but which have completely different x - ray characteristics @xcite . amongst the possibilities suggested to explain the differences between these two populations are that the magnetic fields of radio pulsars and magnetars differ in their geometry or orientation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , that magnetars originate from more massive progenitors than do radio pulsars @xcite , that high - field radio pulsars are quiescent magnetars @xcite , or that radio pulsars and magnetars form an evolutionary sequence @xcite .",
    "the environments of magnetars provide unique constraints on their origin and evolution . here",
    "we present hi  observations of the interstellar medium ( ism ) surrounding the axp  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* & references therein ) , which show that this source is possibly associated with a large expanding hi  shell .",
    "this association strengthens the possibility that magnetars are formed from more massive progenitor stars than are radio pulsars .",
    "the hi  data shown here were taken from the southern galactic plane survey ( sgps ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which has mapped hi  and 1.4-ghz continuum emission in the range @xmath5 , @xmath6 , at a resolution of @xmath7 .",
    "the survey combines interferometric data from the australia telescope compact array with single - dish data from the parkes 64-m radio telescope , giving sensitivity to a wide range of spatial scales .",
    "the final spectral line data - set has a velocity resolution of @xmath8  and a sensitivity of @xmath9  k.    the sgps reveals a striking cavity in hi , almost centered on the position of  ( namely @xmath10 ) , as shown in figure  [ fig_bubble ] .",
    "the shell has a central velocity relative to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) @xmath11  ; we thus designate this object . at this central velocity ,",
    "the major and minor axes of are @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "the images of @xmath14 versus @xmath15 and @xmath16 versus @xmath15 , also shown in figure  [ fig_bubble ] , demonstrate that is expanding , at a velocity @xmath17  .",
    "is seen in multiple velocity planes , shows a high contrast between its walls and interior , and changes in angular extent as a function of velocity .",
    "it thus meets all the standard criteria for hi  shells in the ism ( see * ? ? ?",
    "standard rotation curves ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) forbid systemic motions having the central velocity observed for , indicating significant deviations from circular rotation in this region .",
    "however , the shell s central velocity matches the _ observed _  terminal velocity in this direction , which allows us to estimate a distance of 2.7  kpc from geometry alone .",
    "we assume that random cloud motions on the order of 6  contribute to an error in the distance estimate on the order of 40% , or 1  kpc . incorporating both this distance uncertainty and the non - circular shape of the shell ,",
    "we adopt a radius @xmath18  pc . by integrating along a number of lines of sight through the shell walls and then subtracting a mean background",
    ", we find an average hydrogen column density through the shell walls of @xmath19  @xmath20 .",
    "if this material uniformly filled the region into which the shell has expanded , the implied ambient number density is @xmath21  @xmath22 .",
    "shells like  are common , and result from the effect of massive stars on the ism .",
    "specifically ,  could be an hii  region , a snr , or a stellar wind bubble .",
    "below we briefly consider these possibilities    the photoionizing flux needed to maintain an hii  region is @xmath23/3 , where @xmath24  @xmath25  s@xmath26 is the recombination coefficient for hydrogen @xcite .",
    "for the observed values of @xmath27 and @xmath28 , we require @xmath29  s@xmath26 .",
    "this is consistent with the ionizing fluxes of the earliest - type stars , but such a source would also have a radio flux of @xmath30  jy at decimeter wavelengths .",
    "a radio continuum image of this region shows no such emission associated with  @xcite .    for the observed values of @xmath28 , @xmath27 and @xmath31 ,",
    "a snr in the sedov or radiative phases requires an initial explosion energy of @xmath32 or @xmath33  ergs , respectively .",
    "these estimates are both well below the typical supernova explosion energy of @xmath34  ergs , making this interpretation unlikely .",
    "there is also no evidence in deep archival observations for any radio or x - ray snr associated with  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the remaining possibility is that  is a wind - driven bubble . using the wind bubble solution of @xcite , during the energy - conserving phase of expansion",
    "we expect that @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the age of the bubble , @xmath37 is the wind luminosity of the central star , and @xmath38 is the density of the ambient medium . since @xmath39 , we find @xmath40  ergs  s@xmath26 and @xmath41  myr .",
    "the luminosity of the wind is a strong function of mass , allowing a reasonable typing of the associated central object ( assuming only one star powers this bubble ) . in this case ,",
    "an appropriate central source is an o6v star , with a mass - loss rate @xmath42  m@xmath2  yr@xmath26 @xcite , a wind velocity @xmath43  @xcite , and a zero - age main sequence ( zams ) mass of 3040  m@xmath2 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we have shown that  is most likely powered by the wind of a massive star at a distance of @xmath44  kpc .",
    "but can we identify the central star responsible for this bubble ?",
    "there are many massive stars in this direction and at this distance , most of which are part of the association carina  ob1 at a distance of @xmath45  kpc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , we now argue that  is unassociated with , and probably more distant than , the stars in car  ob1 .",
    "first , the collective winds of the massive stars in car  ob1 correspond to a total luminosity of @xmath46  ergs  s@xmath26 @xcite .",
    "combined with the powerful winds from stars in the nearby clusters tr  14 and tr  16 , this should power a much larger expanding superbubble .",
    "indeed such a larger shell , 100200 pc across , has been identified in ionized , neutral and molecular gas @xcite .",
    "any individual star in this vicinity will not sweep up a neutral shell of its own but will contribute to the overall ionized supershell . since the properties of  are consistent with a single star sweeping up neutral gas , it seems unlikely that this shell is in the vicinity of car  ob1 .",
    "second , the visual extinction toward the stars in car  ob1 is low , @xmath47 @xcite . at this extinction and distance , a massive star should be clearly detected at the center of .",
    "for example , the o6v star considered above would have a magnitude @xmath48 .",
    "we have performed an exhaustive search for such sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , from which the only catalogued massive star projected near the center of  is ix  car ( hd  94096 ; see fig .",
    "[ fig_bubble ] ) , an m2iab star with a mass of @xmath49  m@xmath2 .",
    "the distance estimated to ix  car of @xmath50  kpc and its lsr radial velocity of 17  @xcite suggestthat it is a foreground object .",
    "other massive stars in the vicinity , such as hd  93843 , hd  94230 , hd  305599 and ls  1976 , all lie on the very edge or outside of  in projection .",
    "finally , the photoionization from stars in car  ob1 , most notably the o5iii star hd  93843 , should fully ionize the shell .",
    "if we assume that the shell thickness is 20% of its radius , the edges of the shell should show h@xmath51 emission at a surface brightness of thousands of rayleighs .",
    "we have examined sensitive images of this region ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; these show no h@xmath51 emission associated with  down to much lower surface brightness limits .",
    "we therefore believe that  is not exposed to the high ionizing fluxes associated with car  ob1 , but likely has a higher extinction than and is behind these coincident stars .",
    "an important point is that the high extinction that we have invoked only need imply a slightly larger distance for the hi  shell than for car  ob1 , since extinction in this direction has little correspondence with distance .",
    "this is clear from consideration of the @xmath52 wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars within @xmath53 of  @xcite . for stars from this sample with distances in the range 1.73.7  kpc as appropriate for",
    ", @xmath54 can be as high as 67 .      if  is not associated with any of the known bright stars in this direction , what is powering it ?",
    "if the extinction to  is significantly higher than to the stars in car  ob1 , its associated star might not be obvious .",
    "we first consider k or m supergiants , which should be prominent in the near - infrared  we estimate a 1.3-@xmath55 m magnitude @xmath56 for a red supergiant at the distance to .",
    "however , using the 2mass point source catalog @xcite , we find no candidates for such a source inside , other than ix  car ( see  [ sec_car ] ) .",
    "we searched for faint ob stars by considering the tycho-2 catalog @xcite , which is 90% complete down to a @xmath15 magnitude of 11.5 .",
    "we assume that any massive star with @xmath57 in this well - studied region would have been classified in earlier efforts , and so only consider stars with @xmath58 . for standard reddening , this implies a color excess @xmath59 and hence for ob stars @xmath60 .",
    "just nine such stars from the tycho-2 catalog lie within the perimeter of , of which three are k or m stars with low extinction , four have high proper motions which indicate that they are foreground objects , one is a foreground b1v star ( ls  1956 ) which is heavily reddened , and one has near infrared magnitudes from 2mass which are inconsistent with it being a massive star at the distance to .",
    "it is certainly possible that stars too faint to be in the tycho-2 catalog could also be candidates .",
    "while we thus accept that we can not make a definitive identification using available data , there is one remaining source , namely the axp  , which we argue below represents a viable association with .",
    "if  generates a wind powered by its spin - down , as do many radio pulsars , then its spin parameters imply only @xmath61  ergs  s@xmath26 @xcite .",
    "this is far too low to be responsible for the surrounding shell .",
    "however , an intriguing alternative is that  was blown by the star whose collapse formed . as for associations between pulsars and snrs",
    ", the likelihood of this association should be judged by geometric correspondence , agreement in distance and age , and evidence for physical interaction .",
    "first considering geometry , it is clear from figure  [ fig_bubble ] that  is close to the center of  in projection .",
    "isolated neutron stars generally have high space velocities , @xmath62  @xcite , so that any neutron star older than @xmath63  kyr will have moved far from its progenitor s wind bubble .",
    "thus the association is only viable if we can argue independently that  is extremely young .",
    "indeed there is good evidence that this is the case , since associations with snrs for other axps argue that these sources all have ages @xmath64  kyr @xcite . in this case",
    "the axp should be centrally located in any progenitor wind bubble , as observed .",
    "we note that the `` characteristic age '' of , @xmath65  kyr @xcite , is indeed small ( where @xmath66 is the star s spin period ) .. ] however , we caution that this and other magnetars do not spin down like normal radio pulsars @xcite , so this age estimate does not provide independent evidence for youth .",
    "second , we consider distance estimates .",
    "the systemic velocity of  puts it at @xmath44  kpc .",
    "no distance estimates exist for , except for the fact that the absorbing column of hydrogen inferred from its x - ray spectrum , @xmath67  @xmath20 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is much higher than that for the carina complex ( which includes car  ob1 ) at a distance of @xmath68  kpc .",
    "it has thus been argued that 2.5  kpc is a firm lower limit on the distance to this source @xcite .",
    "however , the high column to  is still compatible with the distance to .",
    "for standard gas to dust ratios , @xmath67  @xmath20 implies a visual extinction @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "the wr catalogue of @xcite demonstrates that this level of extinction is consistent with distances in the range @xmath70  kpc in this region , so is easily reconciled with the distance to .",
    "third , we need to determine if the age of  is consistent with that expected for the progenitor of . a star with a zams mass of @xmath71  m@xmath2 and",
    "solar metallicity lives for @xmath72  myr ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "since the age of the axp is negligible in comparison , this should also be the age of the surrounding bubble .",
    "however , in  [ sec_int1 ] , we esimated an age for the shell of @xmath73  myr .",
    "there is clearly a large discrepancy between these two estimates .",
    "however , this same age problem has been observed for many other hi  shells around individual massive stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there is no simple resolution to this discrepancy , although in some cases it may be explained by a `` blow out '' into a lower density environment @xcite .",
    "we conclude that any discrepancy between the ages estimated for  and for the progenitor of  is not a strong argument against their association .",
    "finally , we consider direct physical evidence that  and are associated .",
    "young neutron stars should be embedded in young snrs , but for  no such snr is observed @xcite .",
    "a simple explanation is that the associated snr is expanding into a low density bubble , so that it does not yet produce observable emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus from the absence of a snr , it is reasonable to expect that  should show evidence for a surrounding cavity :  clearly fulfills this prediction . for a snr shock velocity of 5000",
    ", the blast wave should impact the shell walls @xmath74  kyr after core collapse .",
    "the lack of any radio or x - ray emission from this event requires the neutron star to be younger than this , consistent with the small ages expected for axps .    to summarize ,",
    "a very young neutron star with a massive progenitor should be centrally located in an expanding hi  shell , with no evidence for a surrounding snr .",
    "this is exactly what we observe for  and .",
    "both sources are consistent with being at a distance of @xmath74  kpc , behind @xmath75 magnitudes of optical extinction .",
    "as explained in  [ sec_intro ] , a fundamentally unresolved issue in the study of compact objects is why some neutron stars are ordinary radio pulsars , while others are magnetars . since the initial mass function ( imf )",
    "sharply declines with increasing zams mass , most neutron star progenitors will have masses near the minimum mass for core collapse , i.e. , 89  m@xmath2 .",
    "we have presented evidence here that the progenitor of axp  was considerably more massive than this .",
    "for some sgrs , possible associations with massive star clusters similarly argue for high - mass progenitors ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we thus propose that the difference between normal pulsars and magnetars is the progenitor mass .",
    "we note that massive ( @xmath76  m@xmath2 ) stars do not always form black holes : for solar metallicity , mass loss causes single stars heavier than @xmath77  m@xmath2 to form neutron stars @xcite ; a progenitor of lower mass ( @xmath78  m@xmath2 ) whose binary companion strips its outer envelope before core collapse can also form a neutron star @xcite .    why should massive stars form magnetars ?",
    "@xcite and @xcite argue that magnetars result from rapidly rotating ( @xmath79  ms ) proto - neutron stars , in which an efficient large - scale dynamo operates in the first few seconds after birth , generating a super - strong magnetic field with significant multipolar components .",
    "@xcite have recently carried out a series of calculations of differentially rotating magnetized supernova progenitors .",
    "they find that magnetic torques are especially effective at transferring angular momentum away from the stellar core during the red supergiant and helium burning phases of evolution . for progenitors with masses",
    "@xmath80  m@xmath2 , this results in neutron stars with initial periods @xmath80  ms , too slow to generate magnetar - like fields .",
    "however for more massive stars , the reduced time interval between hydrogen depletion and the supernova results in limited braking of the core , producing much more rapidly spinning neutron stars .",
    "for example , a 35  m@xmath2 progenitor results in a neutron star of initial period 3  ms , in the range needed to give birth to a magnetar .    within this scenario ,",
    "we can immediately make a prediction as to the relative birth rates of radio pulsars versus magnetars . for argument s sake , we suppose that the mass cut between normal pulsars and magnetars is at a zams mass of 25  m@xmath2 . then for an imf of slope @xmath81 for massive stars ( @xmath82 ; @xcite @xcite )",
    ", only @xmath49% of progenitors can potentially form magnetars . since @xmath83% of progenitors heavier than 25  m@xmath2 will form black holes @xcite",
    ", we infer that the magnetar birth rate is @xmath84% of that of radio pulsars .",
    "the birth rate estimated from observations of the existing populations of axps and sgrs is already comparable to this @xcite .",
    "if magnetars indeed form from massive progenitors , we anticipate that there is no substantial population of such sources yet to be identified ( cf .",
