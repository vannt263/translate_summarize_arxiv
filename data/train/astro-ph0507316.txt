    "observations by the egret instrument on board the cgro have established presence of isotropic extragalactic background radiation in the @xmath4mev  @xmath3gev photon energy range , with an integrated flux @xmath5ph@xmath6s@xmath7sr@xmath7 and a curved ( concave ) spectrum @xcite .",
    "it has been argued @xcite , that the bulk of this emission most likely originates from unresolved blazars , whose properties are similar to those detected by egret @xcite . however , as the internal parameters and cosmological distribution of egret - like blazar sources are not precisely known , the origin of the diffuse @xmath0-ray background is still being debated , and new classes of objects emitting gev photons can be analyzed in this context ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) .    here",
    "we discuss the issue of high - energy @xmath0-ray emission from the kiloparsec - scale jets in fr  i radio galaxies , and in particular its contribution to the @xmath0-ray background radiation as measured by egret .",
    "our study is stimulated by recent results from the chandra x - ray observatory , which have shown that x - ray jet emission is common in fr  i sources @xcite .",
    "the established synchrotron origin of this x - ray emission ( see all the references above ) implies that the kpc - scale jets in fr  i radio galaxies will , at some level , be sources of high- and very high - energy @xmath0-ray emission due to the inverse - compton scattering of ambient ( galactic ) photon fields by the synchrotron - emitting electrons .",
    "this problem was discussed by @xcite , and considered in more detail for the specific case of the radio galaxy m  87 by @xcite .",
    "the aim of our study  which is an extension of the previous analysis  is twofold , namely an estimation of the aforementioned contribution ( taking into account effects of absorption and subsequent re - processing of @xmath0-ray photons by infrared - to - ultraviolet background radiation ) , and discussion of the constraints on the jet parameters which can be imposed in this way .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe the ingredients of the model developed to estimate the contribution of kpc - scale fr  i jets to the @xmath0-ray background . in section  3",
    "we present the results , and discuss briefly the possibility of the direct observation of @xmath0-rays from these sources .",
    "general discussion and the main conclusions are presented in section  4 . throughout the paper",
    "we assume a cosmology with @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10kms@xmath7mpc@xmath7 .",
    "below we describe the procedure used to estimate the @xmath0-ray emission from a ` typical ' kpc - scale jet in a fr  i radio galaxy .",
    "we assume that all of these objects have similar properties , and that the detection rate of their brightest knots at optical and x - ray frequencies depends solely on the amount of relativistic beaming @xcite . within this approach , we find the ` universal ' electron energy distribution in the brightest knots of these jets by fitting a broken power - law to the radio  to  x - ray synchrotron continua of the collected jet sources .",
    "next , we compute the @xmath0-ray emission due to inverse - compton ( ic ) scattering of the re - constructed universal electron energy distribution on the starlight radiation of the host galaxies @xcite .",
    "we include both the klein - nishina effects and the relativistic bulk velocity of the emitting plasma in the analysis .",
    "we also present the adopted approach in relating the @xmath0-ray output of the jets with the total radio luminosities of the analyzed sources , and hence the @xmath0-ray luminosity function ( glf ) of kpc - scale fr  i jets with the radio luminosity function ( rlf ) of low - power radio galaxies @xcite . finally , we briefly describe the adopted model for the absorption of the emitted high - energy @xmath0-ray photons by the infrared - to - ultraviolet metagalactic radiation field ( mrf ) , taking into account evolution of the background photon field up to high redshifts @xcite , and also re - processing of the absorbed @xmath0-ray photons to lower energies by the cascading processes .",
    "we collate data for all fr  i radio galaxies with detected x - ray jets .",
    "we restrict our analysis to the brightest knots in these jets , which are placed at @xmath11 kpc from the galactic nuclei , thus obtaining a list of 11 sources .",
    "table  1 summarizes the input parameters for the considered knots , i.e. , the radio fluxes @xmath12 as measured at @xmath13ghz , the optical fluxes @xmath14 ( if available ) at @xmath15hz , and the x - ray fluxes @xmath16 at @xmath17kev photon energies .",
    "we fit broken power - laws to the radio - to - x - ray continua of the analyzed knots , with spectral indices @xmath18 and @xmath19 measured directly from the data or , when large uncertainties are encountered , with the adopted median values @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "we assume a spherical geometry of radius @xmath22pc for all knots , which corresponds to an angular radius of @xmath23 at the distance of m  87 ( see in this context * ? ? ?",
    "the obtained values of the break frequencies in the synchrotron spectra , @xmath24 , as well as the equipartition magnetic field computed for no relativistic beaming , @xmath25 , are also given in table  1 , together with the radio luminosity of the whole source , @xmath26 , as given by @xcite after conversion to our adopted cosmology and an observation frequency of 5ghz ( assuming a radio spectral index for the whole source of 0.8 ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . finally , in table  1 we give the estimated value of the ratio between the 5ghz luminosity of each analyzed knot and the 5ghz total luminosity of the source , @xmath27 \\over l_{\\rm tot } } \\quad .\\ ] ]    the fitting procedure described above allows us to find the ` typical ' parameters of the brightest knots in fr  i radio galaxies , which we adopt hereafter . besides the spectral indices , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , they are the median synchrotron break frequency , @xmath28hz , the median equipartition magnetic field , @xmath29@xmath2 g , and the median luminosity ratio , @xmath30 . assuming hereafter a universal value of @xmath31 for all fr  i sources , we are able to express the synchrotron luminosity of each knot ( and hence to normalize the energy distribution of the synchrotron - emitting electrons for each knot ) in terms of the total radio luminosity of the source .",
    "we further choose ` typical ' values for the kinematic parameters of the jets at the position of the analyzed knots , namely a bulk lorentz factor of @xmath32 and a jet viewing angle of @xmath33 .",
    "this particular ( although sufficient for our purposes ) choice is in agreement with the one - sidedness of the x - ray jets detected in fr  i radio galaxies , and with the jet  counterjet radio brightness asymmetry for all the sources analyzed in this paper . also , it results in a doppler factor of the emitting plasma of @xmath34 , leading to @xmath35 .    with the above parameters , we reconstruct the energy distribution of the synchrotron - emitting electrons , and then compute their unabsorbed @xmath0-ray emission due to ic scattering on the starlight photon field .",
    "we use formulae from @xcite , including the klein - nishina effects and relativistic velocity of the emitting plasma ( see a detailed description in * ? ? ?",
    "we assume a characteristic frequency of the starlight emission of @xmath36hz , and a bolometric starlight energy density at @xmath11kpc from the galactic center of @xmath37 erg @xmath38 , both as measured in the host - galaxy rest frame ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the starlight radiation energy density then dominates the other photon fields in the jet rest frame , in particular the energy density of the synchrotron photons , by more than an order of magnitude for knot synchrotron luminosities @xmath39ergs@xmath7 and other parameters as discussed in the paper .",
    "the resulting intrinsic ic luminosity , @xmath40 , consists of a power - law continuum @xmath41 at photon energies @xmath42gev , a break region between @xmath43gev and @xmath4gev due to both the transition between the thomson and the klein - nishina regimes and a break in the electron energy distribution , and finally a steep power - law for @xmath44gev ( see figure  1 ) . with",
    "a maximum electron energy of @xmath45 assumed hereafter , the maximum ic photon energy is @xmath46tev .",
    "note that the energy density of the jet magnetic field in the emitting plasma rest frame ( denoted by primes ) , @xmath47erg@xmath38 , is roughly comparable with the energy density of the starlight radiation , @xmath48erg@xmath38 , and hence the intrinsic ic luminosity is roughly comparable with the synchrotron luminosity . in particular , by integrating over the ic photon energy range , @xmath49 , we find that @xmath50 for @xmath51mev and @xmath52gev . due to the specific spectral shape of the intrinsic ic emission , with a maximum at @xmath53gev ,",
    "the above relation is expected to be correct also for @xmath54mev and @xmath55gev .",
    "obviously , the observed ic emission will be modified by the effects of absorption and subsequent re - processing of high - energy @xmath0-ray photons on the diffuse cosmic background radiation fields , as described below .",
    "high - energy @xmath0-ray photons produced at cosmological distances are likely to be absorbed by the diffuse cosmic background radiation due to photo - photon annihilation @xcite .",
    "the absorbed @xmath0-rays are then re - emitted at lower energies due to inverse - compton radiation of the created electron - positron pairs in the cascading process @xcite . among other implications ,",
    "this process is of significant interest in studying the contribution of cosmologically distant sources to the @xmath0-ray background @xcite .",
    "a crucial point in the analysis of the attenuation of high - energy @xmath0-rays emitted by cosmologically distant objects is , however , the knowledge of spectral shape of the mrf in the infrared - to - ultraviolet photon energy range , which is responsible for the @xmath0-ray absorption / re - emission , and of its evolution up to high redshifts ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this is a complicated problem , since the direct measurements of the mrf at infrared wavelengths are difficult ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "we note that careful analysis of the spectra of tev - emitting blazars constitutes a very promising ( although not direct , and , in addition , restricted to redshifts @xmath56 ) method for constraining unknown parameters of the mrf ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) .    here",
    "we adopt a model proposed by @xcite , which under a minimum of parameters and assumptions follows the evolution of the mrf from redshift @xmath57 to @xmath58 , fulfilling all the observational constraints on the mrf in the infrared - to - optical band at the present epoch .",
    "this forward evolution model based on optical and infrared galaxy surveys considers emission from stars , gas and dust in optically selected galaxies as well as in luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ligs / uligs ) .",
    "the contribution of ligs is essential , since the number of stars formed in this object is comparable to the one in optically selected galaxies , and their contribution to the infrared - to - ultraviolet metagalactic radiation field is about 50@xmath59 .",
    "we note that in a framework of the adopted model the uv background is underestimated at redshifts @xmath60 by a factor of 2 - 4 . with this for the mrf , we derive the optical depth for @xmath0-ray absorption ( including the effects of re - emission ) as a function of redshift and @xmath0-ray photon energy , @xmath61 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and compute the observed absorbed ic flux of the selected fr  i jets , @xmath62 \\over 4 \\pi \\",

    "we take the radio luminosity function  i.e. the number of sources per unit comoving volume per unit ( base @xmath3 ) logarithm of the source luminosity  characterizing low - power radio sources ( including ` classical ' fr  i radio galaxies and fr  ii radio galaxies with weak / absent emission lines ) in the form : @xmath69 as discussed by @xcite .",
    "we adopt the values of the five free parameters of @xmath70 as determined from 3crr , 6ce and 7crs samples for a @xmath71 and @xmath72kms@xmath7mpc@xmath7 cosmology by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* model c therein ) .",
    "we then convert this rlf to the modern cosmology adopted here , and convert the total radio luminosity to the ic jet luminosity @xmath73 according to equation  2 .",
    "hence , we obtain the @xmath0-ray luminosity function for the jets in fr  i radio galaxies , which can be written in the form @xmath74 where @xmath75 ( where @xmath76 is in mpc@xmath77 ) , @xmath78 , @xmath79 ( where @xmath80 is now the critical intrinsic @xmath0-ray luminosity of the jet in erg s@xmath7 ) , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 .",
    "the function @xmath83 expresses the transformation of the comoving volume elements between different cosmological models , @xmath84 we note that @xmath85 and @xmath86 ^ 2 \\quad { \\rm with } \\quad e(z ) = \\sqrt{\\omega_{\\rm m } \\ , ( 1+z)^3 + \\omega_{\\lambda } } , & & \\\\",

    "we note that a similar approach to the luminosity function was adopted by @xcite , who discussed the _ extended _ x - ray emission of fr  i radio galaxies ( due to ic scattering of the cosmic microwave background radiation by radio - emitting electrons ) in the context of deep x - ray surveys .",
    "figure  2 ( bottom panel ) shows also the cumulative number density of the low - power radio sources considered here , @xmath91 as a function of redshift , for the set of @xmath92ergs@xmath7 , @xmath93ergs@xmath7 , @xmath94ergs@xmath7 , and @xmath95ergs@xmath7 .",
    "as illustrated , a change in the lowest luminosity of the glf by an order of magnitude can change the number density of objects by a factor of about @xmath96 .",
    "below we take @xmath97ergs@xmath7 , corresponding to the lowest @xmath98ghz luminosity of the whole source @xmath99ergs@xmath7 , and note that the lack of such low - luminosity objects in our small observed ` sample ' ( table  1 ) is most probably due to selection effects only . however , because of the very low @xmath0-ray emission of such extremely low - power radio galaxies , the particular choice of @xmath100 will not substantially affect the following estimates . on the other hand , the number of high - luminosity sources in the population considered here , i.e. , sources with a total radio power exceeding fanaroff - riley critical luminosity ( roughly @xmath101 erg s@xmath7 ) , is negligible when compared to the number of lower - luminosity ( ` classical ' fr  i ) objects . in other words , the adopted upper cut - off in the glf , @xmath95ergs@xmath7 , can also be safely assumed in the following calculations .",
    "we finally note in this context , that x - ray jets with properties similar to the ` classical ' fr  i x - ray jets are indeed discovered in radio galaxies of intermediate power and morphology ( e.g. , 3c 15 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the @xmath0-ray emission due to inverse - compton scattering of starlight photons in the kpc - scale jets of fr  i radio galaxies is relatively weak , accounting for only a small fraction of the direct egret measurement in the @xmath68gev photon energy range , consistent with the analysis presented by @xcite .",
    "we note that for an egret sensitivity of @xmath102ph@xmath6s@xmath7 , corresponding to a @xmath103 detection in a one - year all - sky - survey @xcite , the ` typical ' fr  i kpc - scale jet as considered here could be eventually detected only if its luminosity distance is roughly @xmath104mpc .",
    "it does not mean , however , that the fr  i jets can not be associated with some unidentified egret sources , as the inverse - comptonization of this and other photon fields ( especially within the inner portions of the outflows ) in some particular fr  i objects can result in @xmath0-ray signals exceeding the egret sensitivity ( see in this context * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "promisingly , glast is expected to be a much more powerful instrument than egret , with the planned sensitivity for a @xmath103 detection of a point source within the photon energy range @xmath105gev in one - year all - sky - survey of @xmath106ph@xmath6s@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "thus , one should expect glast to observe at least a few fr  i radio galaxies at redshifts @xmath107 due to the @xmath0-ray emission of their brightest kpc - scale knots , if the jet parameters we assume are correct .",
    "in particular , the @xmath108 distribution of the analyzed objects , @xmath109 ( where @xmath110 corresponds to the minimum ic jet luminosity which would allow for a glast detection as discussed above ) , gives three observable fr  i jets for @xmath111ergs@xmath7 .",
    "therefore , a glast survey covering low - power radio sources will be able to verify our simple model",
    ".    meanwhile , the contribution of fr  i jets to the egret @xmath0-ray background can be evaluated for unresolved sources as @xmath112 = { 4 \\pi \\over \\omega_{\\rm eg } } \\ , \\int_{z_{\\rm min}}^{\\rm z_{\\rm max } } { dv \\over d\\omega \\ , dz } \\ , dz \\ , \\int_{l_{\\gamma}^{\\rm low}}^{l_{\\gamma}^{\\rm high } } { \\rho(l_{\\gamma } , \\ , z ) \\over l_{\\gamma } \\ , \\ln 10 } \\ , \\ , [ \\varepsilon s_{\\gamma}(\\varepsilon ) ] \\ , \\ , d l_{\\gamma } \\,\\ ] ] ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where @xmath113 is the solid angle covered by the survey , @xmath114 $ ] is the observed absorbed ic flux in erg@xmath6s@xmath7 ( equation  3 ) , the comoving volume element @xmath115 is given by the equation  8 , and the luminosity function @xmath87 is given in the equation  5 .",
    "the results are presented in figure  3 : the jets in fr  i radio galaxies ( their brightest kpc - scale knots in particular ) can contribute about one percent to the observed extragalactic @xmath0-ray background in the @xmath68gev photon energy range . indeed , a much larger contribution by these objects is not expected , since accordingly to the analysis presented in , e.g. , @xcite , blazar sources can account for the bulk of the extragalactic @xmath0-ray background .",
    "it indicates that the magnetic fields in the analyzed jet regions is not likely to be much smaller _ on average _ than the equipartition value , as otherwise the contribution of the considered objects would be uncomfortably high .",
    "note that the ic jet luminosity scales roughly as @xmath116 , and hence a magnetic field as low as @xmath3@xmath2 g would cause overproduction of the diffuse @xmath0-ray background by the fr  i jets on their own . therefore ,",
    "weak magnetic fields in the brightest kpc - scale knots in fr  i jets can be excluded ( see in this context * ? ? ?",
    "* for the case of m87 jet ) .",
    "there are a few significant features of our analysis .",
    "first , the analysis presented here does not depend on any particular model of particle acceleration in the jet , as the energy distribution of the radiating electrons is inferred directly from their synchrotron emission ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "second , we do not include here the inevitable synchrotron self - compton process , which would increase the expected ic flux of the jets , especially in the ` problematic ' ( because of the absorption / re - procession effects ) very high energy @xmath0-ray band .",
    "note also that , accordingly to our minimum - assumption approach , we consider the same equipartition value for the kpc - scale jet magnetic field in _ all _ fr  i jets , which differ in total radio power ( and hence most probably in jet kinetic luminosity ) by several orders of magnitude . indeed , for low - power jets one should expect an equipartition magnetic field of less than the @xmath1@xmath2 g obtained here for relatively powerful jets from our sample .",
    "in other words , we underestimate the inverse - compton radiation of such extremely weak but numerous sources .",
    "thus , the evaluated @xmath0-ray emission can be considered as a _",
    "lower _ limit only , and so the estimated one percent contribution to the extragalactic @xmath0-ray background can be considered as _ guaranteed _ , as long as the minimum - power hypothesis for the kpc - scale jets in fr  i radio galaxies is correct .",
    "let us also mention that the presence of bright knots at @xmath117kpc from the active centers of fr  i radio galaxies is indeed universal @xcite .",
    "these knots are usually called ` flaring points ' , since their positions always mark the transition in jet collimation and emissivity .",
    "@xcite , who discussed the dynamics of the kpc - scale jet in the fr  i radio galaxy 3c  31 in detail , concluded that the flaring points are most likely caused by the stationary reconfinement shocks formed due to rapid changes in pressure of the hot ambient gas ( see also in this context , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "others attribute them to the kelvin - helmholtz instabilities , whose non - linear development can also result in the formation of weak oblique shocks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "whatever the case is , the analysis presented here suggests that a weak magnetic field at the position of the flaring points is unlikely .",
    "of course , this conclusion is based on a simplified approach in modeling the ic emission of the kpc - scale fr  i jets _ on average _ , and the jet parameters used in our analysis are determined from a relatively small sample of the x - ray emitting objects . however , more sophisticated analyses can be performed only with larger sample of fr  i jets detected at optical and x - ray frequencies .    with the approximate lower limit of @xmath3@xmath2 g",
    ", the dynamical importance of the magnetic field in kpc - scale fr  i jets can not yet be determined , with additional uncertainty arising from the poorly known total kinetic powers of these outflows .",
    "in addition , any possible changes of the magnetic energy flux along the outflows are not constrained in our analysis .",
    "let us only note in this context that modeling of the spectral energy distribution of bl lac objects  believed to be beamed counterparts of fr  i radio galaxies @xcite  usually leads to sub - equipartition magnetic field characterizing the nuclear portion of the low - power jets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although the model uncertainties and variety in bl lacs spectral properties are large .",
    "hence , one can in principle suspect that amplification of the magnetic energy flux along the low - power jets between the sub - pc and kpc scales is required by the data , in agreement with the more detailed analysis of m  87 @xcite .",
    "we note that amplification of a mean magnetic energy flux is indeed expected in any conductive plasma containing non - vanishing helicity of turbulent motions or a strong velocity shear , although the general applicability of the simple kinematic dynamo theory  usually considered in this context  to realistic astrophysical situations ( like the relativistic outflows discussed here ) is not clear ( see , e.g. , the recent review by * ? ? ? * ) .",
