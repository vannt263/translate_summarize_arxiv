    "j/@xmath0 suppression in relativistic heavy ion collisions was suggested as a potential signal of the quark - gluon plasma @xcite . in order to study the j/@xmath0 suppression quantitatively ,",
    "we need to understand how the j/@xmath0 mesons are produced , and the reliability of qcd calculations for j/@xmath0 production .    in order to produce a j/@xmath0 meson in hadronic collisions ,",
    "the energy exchanges in the collisions have to be larger than the j/@xmath0 mass ( @xmath2 ) or the invariant mass of the produced quark pair ( @xmath3  gev ) .",
    "the @xmath4 pairs should be produced at a distance scale @xmath5  fm .",
    "since this is much smaller than the size of a j/@xmath0 and the energy exchanges are much larger than the nonperturbative momentum scales in the j/@xmath0 wave functions , the j/@xmath0 is unlikely to be formed at the collision point . instead",
    ", the j/@xmath0 meson should be formed after some resonance interactions ( or coherent soft gluon interactions between the charm and anticharm quarks ) .",
    "thus , the transformation from a pre - j/@xmath0 @xmath4 pair to a physical j/@xmath0 occurs over several fermi @xcite . during this transformation , the produced @xmath4 pairs can also radiate gluons and have interactions with spectators .",
    "due to gluon radiation and the spectator interactions , it is possible for the @xmath4 states , even with different quantum numbers , to become a j/@xmath0 meson .",
    "however , because of the large energy exchange , the spectators roles in the hard collisions are suppressed by an extra factor @xmath6 $ ] with the medium density @xmath7 and medium length @xmath8 .",
    "if the transverse momentum @xmath9 is large enough , the spectator interactions are strongly suppressed , and the cross sections for hadronic j/@xmath0 production can be factorized @xcite , @xmath10 where @xmath11 run over all parton flavors and the @xmath12 are the normal parton distributions .",
    "the @xmath13 represents the cross section for two partons to produce a j/@xmath0 . without the nuclear medium",
    ", @xmath8 is of the order of the hadron radius ( @xmath14  fm ) .    because the production of the pre - j/@xmath0 @xmath4 states and the transformation to the j/@xmath0 take place at very different distance scales , quantum interference between these two stages is suppressed by the ratio of these two distance scales .",
    "therefore , the partonic cross sections for the j/@xmath0 production in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) can be further factorized into two stages : ( 1 ) short - distance production of the pre - j/@xmath0 partonic states , and ( 2 ) long - distance transition from the partonic states to the physical j/@xmath0 mesons @xcite , @xmath15 } \\int \\frac{dz}{z^2}\\int dm_{c\\bar{c}}^2 \\left (   \\frac{d\\hat{\\sigma}_{ab\\rightarrow [ c\\bar{c } ] } }        { dm_{c\\bar{c}}^2 dy d^2p_{c\\bar{c}_t } } \\right )   d_{[c\\bar{c}]\\rightarrow{\\rm j/}\\psi}(z;m_{c\\bar{c}}^2 ) \\label{eq2}\\ ] ] where @xmath16}$ ] sums over all @xmath4 states , @xmath17 and latexmath:[$m_{c\\bar{c}}^2 \\ll    transition probabilities from pre - j/@xmath0 @xmath4 states to j/@xmath0 mesons , and are defined by matrix elements of non - local operators @xcite .",

    "the @xmath19}$ ] include all soft resonance interactions and gluon radiations .",
    "similar to the parton - to - hadron fragmentation functions , the @xmath19}$ ] depend on nonperturbative physics .",
    "thus , the predictive power of the factorized formula relies on the universality of these transition distributions @xcite .",
    "the non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) model @xcite and the color evaporation ( ce ) model @xcite correspond to two diverse assumptions for the @xmath19}$ ] .",
    "the nrqcd model assumes that the @xmath19}$ ] are steeply falling functions of the invariant masses of the states , and sensitive to the pairs quantum numbers ( such as color and spin ) .",
    "we can represent the leading contributions of this model by expanding the partonic cross section @xmath20}$ ] in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) at @xmath21 and @xmath22 . in the nrqcd model ,",
    "the produced @xmath4 pairs with large @xmath23 have very small probabilities to become j/@xmath0 mesons . on the other hand",
    ", the ce model assumes that the @xmath19}$ ] are independent of the pairs invariant masses ( provided they are below the open charm threshold ) , and are not sensitive to the pairs quantum numbers .",
    "we can represent the ce model by taking @xmath19}=f_{{\\rm j/}\\psi } \\delta(1-z )   \\theta(4m_d^2-m_{c\\bar{c}}^2)$ ] in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) with a fitting constant @xmath24 independent of the @xmath4 pairs quantum numbers .",
    "since the nrqcd and the ce models are both consistent with the existing data on _ inclusive _ j/@xmath0 production , the new qcd factorized formula should also be consistent with the data @xcite . however , both models have difficulties explaining the recent cdf data from fermilab on j/@xmath0 polarization at large transverse momentum @xcite .",
    "-0.35 in    at large transverse momentum , j/@xmath0 are produced mainly from the fragmentation contribution , as shown in fig .  1 , where a virtual gluon is produced and decays into a @xmath4 pair which transmutes into a physical j/@xmath0 .",
    "the polarization of the produced j/@xmath0 depends on the polarization of the @xmath4 pair and the details of the transition distributions @xmath19}$ ] . in order to use the polarization measurements to discern between the production models ,",
    "we need independent tests of the reliability of the qcd formalism for calculating the @xmath4 polarization at large transverse momentum . as illustrated in fig .  1 , the low mass drell - yan lepton - pair s angular distributions at large transverse momentum have a lot in common with the @xmath4 polarization @xcite .",
    "if the qcd calculations are consistent with the virtual photon polarization in drell - yan massive lepton - pair production , we can conclude that the qcd formalism for calculating the polarization of the @xmath4 at large transverse momentum is reliable , and therefore , measurements of j/@xmath0 polarization provide decisive tests for models of j/@xmath0 production .",
    "in addition to polarization measurements , the nuclear medium dependence of j/@xmath0 production is sensitive to the j/@xmath0 formation process @xcite .",
    "if the j/@xmath0 mesons are formed immediately after the production of the @xmath4 pair , the medium dependence is dominated by the hadronic scattering between a color - singlet j/@xmath0 and the nuclear matter . on the other hand ,",
    "if the j/@xmath0 mesons are formed much later , the observed medium dependence is a consequence of the dynamical interactions between the pre - j/@xmath0 @xmath4 states and the nuclear medium .",
    "therefore , the nuclear dependence can help select the correct model for j/@xmath0 production .    in proton - nucleus or nucleus - nucleus collisions ,",
    "the produced @xmath4 pairs are likely to interact with the nuclear medium before they exit .",
    "if we assume each interaction between the @xmath4 pair and the nuclear medium is about the _ same _ and can be treated _ independently _ , we naturally derive the glauber formula : @xmath25 $ ] with effective absorption cross section @xmath26 to change a @xmath4 pair to a pair of open charms , and effective length @xmath27 of the medium in a+b collisions .",
    "the characteristic feature of the glauber formula is a straight line on a semi - log plot of @xmath28 vs. @xmath27 , which is not consistent with the strong j/@xmath0 suppression observed in pb - pb collisions @xcite .    our model of j/@xmath0 suppression",
    "is based on the following points : ( 1 ) it is the @xmath4 pair , not the j/@xmath0 meson , that interacts through most of the nuclear medium ; ( 2 ) multiple interactions of the @xmath29 and/or @xmath30 with soft gluons in the medium increase the relative momentum between the @xmath29 and @xmath30 ; and ( 3 ) as the relative momentum increases , the phase space to form a j/@xmath0 meson decreases @xcite . since multiple soft - scatterings lead to a larger relative momentum between the @xmath29 and @xmath30 , the effective @xmath26 of the pair increases as the @xmath4 passes through the medium leading to a stronger suppression than given by the simple glauber formula which applies to single particle propagation @xcite .",
    "integrating over j/@xmath0 s momentum in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , we obtain a factorized expression for the j/@xmath0 total cross section @xmath31 }   \\int dx \\phi_{a / a}(x)\\int dx ' \\phi_{b / b}(x ' ) \\int dm_{c\\bar{c}}^2   \\frac{d\\hat{\\sigma}_{ab\\rightarrow [ c\\bar{c } ] } }        { dm_{c\\bar{c}}^2 }   f_{[c\\bar{c}]\\rightarrow{\\rm j/}\\psi}(m_{c\\bar{c}}^2 ) \\label{eq3}\\ ] ] where @xmath32\\rightarrow{\\rm j/}\\psi}$ ] represents an inclusive transition probability for a @xmath4 pair of invariant mass @xmath23 to become a j/@xmath0 meson . without the large transverse momentum , the corrections to eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) from the spectator interactions , which are suppressed by a factor @xmath33 , become more important because of the large medium length @xmath27 . just like the random walk of two particles ,",
    "the soft spectator interactions effectively increase the invariant masses of the @xmath4 pairs , and therefore , reduce the phase space to form j/@xmath0 mesons .",
    "we calculate the j/@xmath0 suppression in the nuclear medium by including the multiple spectator interactions to the pre - j/@xmath0 @xmath4 pairs , and plot our results in figs .  2 and 3 .",
    "the data are from ref .",
    "the dashed lines are predictions of the glauber formula , and the solid lines are the results of our calculations . with only one parameter @xmath34 , which is defined as average gain of invariant mass per unit medium length and is fixed by the total suppression in fig .  2 , our calculations of the j/@xmath0 suppression are consistent with all existing data , except a couple of points at the highest @xmath1 bins of the new na50 data @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the nrqcd model and the ce model are closely connected to the new qcd factorization formula for j/@xmath0 production .",
    "the measurements of j/@xmath0 polarization could provide a decisive test of the production mechanism .",
    "our model of j/@xmath0 suppression is consistent with nearly all existing data on j/@xmath0 total cross section ."
