    "thermoelectric material is a functional material that converts heat into electricity and vice versa through the seebeck and peltier effects @xcite .",
    "high - efficiency thermoelectric material is of particular importance because of its potential application for energy - conversion technology using waste heat @xcite .",
    "although the thermoelectric conversion efficiency is insufficient at present , various important concepts to improve the efficiency have been recently proposed @xcite .",
    "the fundamental route for efficient thermoelectrics is to increase the dimensionless figure of merit @xmath0 , where @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 are the seebeck coefficient , electrical conductivity , thermal conductivity , and absolute temperature , respectively . in conventional semiconductors ,",
    "the @xmath5 value ( power factor ) is maximized with optimal carrier concentration of the order of 10@xmath6 @xmath7 owing to a trade - off relation between @xmath1 and @xmath2 in terms of carrier concentration @xcite , and the thermal conductivity is mainly governed by the lattice contribution @xmath8 near room temperature .",
    "thus , optimization of the carrier concentration is a basic step to improve the thermoelectric efficiency , which has been typically achieved by chemical substitutions for parent semiconductors .",
    "it was recently shown that an electric - field application to field effect transistor structure on a thermoelectric material is also an effective tool to control the concentration and improve the thermoelectric property @xcite .",
    "the induced two - dimensional electron gas exhibits unusually large seebeck coefficient , which might be attributed to an enhanced density of states due to the low - dimensional structure @xcite .",
    "the light illumination may be a simple and useful way to optimize the carrier concentration and improve the effciency .",
    "the conduction phenomenon attributed to the excited carriers by the light illumination is known as the photoconduction .",
    "likewise , the seebeck effect contributed from such photo - induced carriers is called `` photo - seebeck effect '' , which was first measured in conventional semiconductor ge by tauc in 1955 @xcite . in 1970s ,",
    "the photo - seebeck effect has been explored in several semiconductors si , gaas , and cds @xcite .",
    "these materials exhibit finite photo - response for the seebeck coefficient as well as the conductivity . the light illumination for ge increases @xmath2 and decreases @xmath9 , naively understood within the photo - doping effect @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , silicon exhibits nontrivial photo - seebeck effect near room temperature : both @xmath2 and @xmath9 are increased by light illumination , which can not be understood within a simple model @xcite .",
    "the elucidation of the mechanism of such unusual photo - transport behaviors possibly provides a new idea for efficient thermoelectrics .",
    "note that the photo - seebeck effect measured with different photon energies might be a powerful tool to investigate detailed electronic band structure as well @xcite . however , there are only a few reports regarding the photo - seebeck effect , and the thermoelectric transport nature of the photo - induced carriers is poorly understood so far .    here ,",
    "we report first investigation of the photo - seebeck effect in the wide - gap oxide semiconductor zno ( band gap of @xmath10 ev ) , which is known as a transparent conducting oxide widely used for applications @xcite .",
    "aluminum - doped zno is investigated as a potential thermoelectric oxide as well @xcite .",
    "we construct the photo - seebeck measurement system , and observe the strong variations of the seebeck coefficient and the electrical conductivity under the ultraviolet light illumination , whose photon energy exceeds the band - gap energy of zno . to analyze the observed data , we utilize a simple parallel circuit model and determine the contributions from the photo - induced carriers existing only near the illuminated sample surface .",
    "our results demonstrate that the distinct variations of transport properties originate from the changes of both carrier concentration and mobility with illuminating light , that is discussed within the framework of conventional semiconductor physics .    ,",
    "( b ) the thermoelectric voltage @xmath11 , and ( c ) the temperature difference @xmath12 . the voltage and temperature were measured with several heater - power applications .",
    "the illumination was performed with the ultraviolet led ( @xmath13  ev ) .",
    "( d ) the schematic experimental setup for the photo - seebeck measurement . ]",
    "we construct the photo - transport measurement system inside the physical property measurement system ( ppms ) .",
    "the experimental configuration is schematically shown in fig .",
    "1(d ) , which is based on ref .  .",
    "we measure the resistivity and the seebeck coefficient under light illumination with green ( @xmath14  ev ) and ultraviolet ( uv ) ( @xmath13  ev ) light - emitting diodes ( leds ) .",
    "the electric contacts are covered with aluminum foils to prevent an extrinsic photo - voltaic effects around such regions .",
    "the electrical resistivity was measured with the two - wire method .",
    "the seebeck coefficient was measured with standard steady - state method .",
    "the temperature difference @xmath12 between hot and cold sides , which is made by applying current @xmath15 to the resistive heater on the hot side , is determined from the thermoelectric voltage of the bridged constantan wire .",
    "all measurements has been performed at @xmath16  k. we used zno single crystals ( typical dimension of 5@xmath172@xmath170.5 mm@xmath18 ) purchased from a materials company ( mti corporation ) . led illumination was done to the @xmath19 plane .",
    "we firstly describe our experimental procedure for the photo - seebeck measurements .",
    "we measure the thermoelectric voltage @xmath11 and the temperature difference @xmath12 under illuminations with several different light intensities controlled by the excitation current for led @xmath20 .",
    "figures 1(a - c ) display the measurement time dependence of @xmath20 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , respectively . here",
    "we show the results for the uv led illumination with five different light intensities . to eliminate a constant voltage due to a photo - voltaic effect from inhomogeneities inside the crystal , we measure @xmath11 with several different @xmath12 by applying different heater currents @xmath15 . from these data ,",
    "we obtain the seebeck coefficient @xmath21/[\\delta t(i_{\\rm heater } = 20 \\mbox { ma } ) - \\delta t(17 \\mbox { ma})]$ ] . as shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) , the thermoelectric voltage @xmath11 is significantly varied with led light illumination , change of which from the dark value increases with increasing @xmath20 .",
    "we note that the temperature difference @xmath12 and the averaged temperature between hot and cold sides are slightly changed by illuminations as shown in fig .",
    "1(c ) , however , such temperature change during the measurement is negligibly small , which can not explain the observed large @xmath11 variations under illuminations .",
    "the electrical resistivity is measured using same experimental configuration without thermal gradient .     and ( b ) the seebeck coefficient @xmath1 of zno single crystal .",
    "the excitation current for led illumination @xmath20 is also plotted as a function of the time in the right axis of ( a ) . ]",
    "the photo - transport properties of zno obtained from above procedures are plotted in figs .",
    "2(a ) and 2(b ) . figure 2(a ) shows the resistivity variation measured under five different light intensities indicated as @xmath20 in the right axis .",
    "the uv led illumination considerably decreases the resistivity , whereas the green light with lower photon energy negligibly affects the resistivity , indicating that the electron - hole pairs are created by illuminating uv light across the band gap of zno and contribute the conduction .",
    "figure 2(b ) displays the seebeck coefficient measured under illumination .",
    "we observe a significant decrease of @xmath9 with uv illumination , while the green one shows no influence for @xmath1 , consistent with the photoconductivity results shown in fig .",

    "figure 3(a ) depicts the relation between the seebeck coefficient @xmath1 and electrical conductivity @xmath2 measured under the uv led illumination . at dark",
    ", this sample exhibits an @xmath25-type conduction ( @xmath1 = -550 @xmath26v / k ) , which might be attributed to impurity hydrogen @xcite . under uv illuminations , similar to earlier studies on ge @xcite ,",
    "the conductivity is increased and the seebeck coefficient is decreased in magnitude as expected in the photo - doping effect . as discussed in ref .",
    ", this @xmath1 variation should be related to the difference of mobilities of valence and conduction bands since the illumination creates electron - hole pairs .",
    "we also note that the absorption coefficient of zno is about @xmath27 @xmath28 at @xmath29 = 3.4 ev @xcite , indicating that the illuminated uv light can penetrate into very thin region ( @xmath30 nm ) from the surface .",
    "we then apply a simple parallel - circuit model composed of thin conducting and thick insulating layers [ the inset of fig .",
    "3(b ) ] in order to analyze the observed photo - transport properties . the measured electrical conductivity @xmath2 and seebeck coefficient @xmath1 are expressed by @xcite @xmath31 @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the sample thickness ( 0.5 mm ) and @xmath34 is the penetration depth ( 50 nm ) . here",
    "@xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) and @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) are the electrical conductivities ( the seebeck coefficients ) measured at dark and induced by the light illumination , respectively .",
    "now @xmath39 , then the photo - induced transport components @xmath23 and @xmath22 are @xmath40 @xmath41 figure 3(b ) shows the photo - induced seebeck coefficient @xmath22 as a function of the photo - induced electrical conductivity @xmath23 obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ sig0last ] ) and ( [ s0last ] ) ( the jonker plot for the photo - induced transport properties ) .",
    "the dotted line shows the slope of @xmath24 , which is expected in doped semiconductors @xcite .",
    "the obtained @xmath22-@xmath23 behavior roughly coincides with this slope , implying that the thermoelectric transport property of photo - induced carriers can be discussed in terms of conventional semiconductor physics as well .     and",
    "( b ) mobility @xmath26 of the photo - induced carriers as a function of the excitation current for led illumination @xmath20 .",

    "we next show the photo - induced carrier concentration @xmath25 , which can be obtained from the photo - induced seebeck coefficient @xmath22 . in the degenerate regime ,",
    "the seebeck coefficient is expressed by @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the fermi energy for a simple parabolic band ( @xmath44 is the effective mass , which is assumed to be @xmath45 @xcite ) and @xmath46 is a scattering parameter ( @xmath47 for an electron - phonon scattering and @xmath48 for an impurity scattering ) @xcite . in the non - degenerate regime , it is given by @xmath49 , \\label{ndeg}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 .",
    "figure 4(a ) displays the excitation current @xmath20 dependence of @xmath25 determined with using eqs .",
    "( [ deg ] ) and ( [ ndeg ] ) . here",
    ", we adopt @xmath47 , which is not crucial to the results . the carrier concentration at dark is determined with the non - degenerate model [ eq .",
    "( [ ndeg ] ) ] , yielding @xmath51 @xmath7 , as shown by the arrow in fig .",
    "4(a ) . under illuminations",
    ", @xmath25 is increased from the dark value in both models , and reaches about @xmath52 @xmath7 at maximum light intensity .",
    "this value corresponds to about 0.1% al - doping effect for zno @xcite and is close to the value of the optimized carrier concentration in conventional thermoelectric materials @xcite .",
    "we have also evaluated the photon number from the output power ( 1.5 mw at @xmath20 = 20 ma ) of the uv led light .",
    "the number of photons is about @xmath53 photons / s .",
    "however , the electron - hole recombination time in zno depends on samples and even a persistent photoconductivity is observed in several samples owing to hole traps in grain boundaries and/or oxygen vacancies @xcite . also , we used a wide - angle led light .",
    "these arbitrary properties make it difficult to quantitatively compare the photo - induced carrier concentration with the number of photons absorbed by the sample .",
    "the mobility @xmath26 of the photo - induced carriers can be evaluated as @xmath54 , shown in fig .",
    "4(b ) as a function of @xmath20 .",
    "in contrast to high - mobility zno samples @xcite , our sample exhibits very low mobility of @xmath55 @xmath56/vs at dark , which is evaluated with using the carrier concentration and the conductivity measured at dark .",
    "the uv illumination considerably increases the mobility roughly by one order of magnitude .",
    "such mobility variations under illumination have been also reported in photo - hall measurements on zno single crystal @xcite , although they measured only transport relaxation process after the illumination . there , the illumination changes both the carrier concentration and the mobility , consistent with our present results .    let us discuss more detailed transport mechanism of photo - induced carriers . in zno ,",
    "the conduction phenomena are mainly governed by polaronic electrons in a broad zn 4@xmath57 conduction band , which are supplied from hydrogenic donor . on the other hand ,",
    "the holes in narrow o 2@xmath58 and zn 3@xmath33 valence bands are mostly trapped and negligibly contribute to the transport properties @xcite . under uv illuminations , therefore , only electrons of the photo - induced electron - hole pairs are mobile and contribute to the photoconductivity and photo - seebeck effect .",
    "it is also known that the molecular oxygen in atmosphere significantly affects the transport properties of zno @xcite . at the surface ,",
    "adsorbed oxygen molecules are charged by removing the electrons from the conduction bands , and then tightly bound to the surface .",
    "this oxygen adsorption process thus decreases the conductivity . under illuminations ,",
    "such charged oxygen loses its charge by attracting hole of the photo - induced electron - hole pair .",
    "meanwhile , the electron remains in the conduction bands , leading to an increase of the conductivity .",
    "such effects are usually dominant in thin films and porous materials with high surface - to - volume ratio , but not in single - crystalline bulk materials . in present case",
    ", however , the light - penetrated region is very thin ( @xmath59 nm ) , then such surface effects should be considered .    under illuminations ,",
    "the mobility is also increased as well as the carrier concentration , which has been indicated in the photo - hall experiments as well @xcite .",
    "the origin of the enhanced mobility by illumination is an open question . in semiconductors ,",
    "the mobility exhibits a non - monotonic variation as a function of the carrier concentration owing to multiple scattering mechanisms @xcite . in high - concentration region , where the ionized impurity scattering is dominant , the mobility is decreased with increasing carrier concentration @xcite . on the other hand , at low carrier concentrations ,",
    "the mobility is limited by grain - boundary or surface scattering @xcite , even for epitaxial films due to a small amount of mosaic structures @xcite .",
    "this leads to an increase of the mobility with increased carrier concentration , which might be applied in our present results .",
    "the photo - transport measurement using zno samples with different impurity or vacancy levels such as samples annealed in oxygen or hydrogen is a future issue to elucidate the exact mechanism of thermoelectric transport property of photo - induced carriers .",
    "we finally give brief comments on the potential thermoelectrics using light . the light illumination combined with thin film applications may offer a new route toward an efficient thermoelectrics as well as the fundamental understandings of thermoelectric effects induced by photo - excited carriers .",
    "in bulk measurements , we observe the averaged values including large contributions from non - penetrated region . on the other hand ,",
    "if the sample thickness is smaller than the penetration length ( i.e. @xmath60 ) , one can directly observe photo - induced components of the conductivity @xmath23 and the seebeck coefficient @xmath22 .",
    "in present case , the improvement of the mobility with illuminating light directly contributes the @xmath61 enhancement by using thin films .",
    "illumination on semiconductors with large absorption coefficient may produce an unexpectedly large photo - seebeck effect owing to its low dimensionality .",
    "furthermore , light is able to be utilized as a heat source to make a thermal gradient as well , then a light - concentration - type thermoelectric module is possibly an efficient photo - thermoelectrics using thin films .",
    "we have investigated the photo - seebeck effect as well as the photoconductivity in the wide - gap oxide semiconductor zno for the first time .",
    "we observe a significant variation of such transport quantities , which are sensitive to the photon energy of illuminated light .",
    "the ultraviolet light illumination decreases both the absolute value of seebeck coefficient and the resistivity , acting as a photo - doping effect to zno .",
    "a parallel - circuit model is applied to extract the photo - induced contributions from the observed transport data , which is discussed through the jonker analysis .",
    "our results demonstrate that both the carrier concentration and the mobility are increased from dark by illuminations , which can be qualitatively argued within the framework of conventional semiconductor physics .",
    "thin film applications may be efficient for photo - thermoelectrics .",
