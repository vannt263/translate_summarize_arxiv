    "for instance , smooth , noncompact , simply - connected @xmath6-manifolds realizing all possible intersection forms arise as orbit spaces of @xmath2.    orbit spaces of general flows often have undesirable topological properties ( e.g. , non - hausdorff , non - metrizable ) . nevertheless , they are ubiquitous in dynamics and are significant since their topological types are invariants of their associated flows up to topological equivalence .",
    "the theory of @xmath7-actions obviously differs markedly from that of actions of compact lie groups , the latter having , for instance , closed and proper orbit space quotient maps  @xcite .",
    "we find orbit spaces of @xmath7-actions to be important and interesting in their own right , with their own problems , and aim to show that they are amenable to topological study .",
    "the present paper arose from our desire to show that a class of dynamically important flows ( i.e. , gradient flows for morse functions ) have semilocally simply - connected orbit spaces .",
