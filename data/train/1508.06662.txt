    "in the recent years , electrospun nanofibers have gained a considerable interest due to many potential industrial applications , such as tissue engineering , air and water filtration , drug delivery and regenerative medicine .",
    "in particular , the high surface area to material mass ratio of the fibers offers intriguing prospects for technological applications . as consequence ,",
    "several studies have focused on the characterization and production of uni - dimensionally elongated nanostructures .",
    "a number of reviews @xcite and books @xcite concerning electrospinning have been published in the last decade .    typically , electrospun nanofibers are produced at laboratory scale via the uniaxial stretching of a jet , which is ejected at a nozzle from an electrified polymer solution .",
    "indeed , the initial elongation of the jet can be obtained by applying an external electrostatic field between the spinneret and a conductive collector .",
    "electrospinning involves mainly two sequential stages in the uniaxial elongation of the extruded polymer jet : an initial quasi - steady stage , in which the electric field stretches the jet in a straight path away from the nozzle , and a second stage characterized by a bending instability induced by small perturbations , which misalign the jet away from its axis of elongation @xcite .",
    "these small disturbances may originate from mechanical vibrations at the nozzle or from hydrodynamic - aerodynamic perturbations within the experimental apparatus .",
    "such a misalignment provides an electrostatic - driven bending instability before the jet reaches the conductive collector , where the fibers are finally collected . as a consequence , the jet path length between the nozzle and the collector increases and the stream cross - section undergoes a further decrease .",
    "the ultimate goal of the electrospinning process are to control the cross - sectional radius and to maximize the uniformity of the collected fibers . by a simple argument of mass conservation ,",
    "this is tantamount to maximizing the jet length by the time it reaches the collecting plane . by the same argument",
    ", it is therefore of interest to minimize the length of the initial stable jet region .",
    "consequently , the bending instability is a desirable effect , as it produces a higher surface - area - to - volume ratio of the jet , which is transferred to the resulting nanofibers @xcite .",
    "recently , due to the broad interest of nanotechnology and to the wide application fields gained by polymer nanofibers even at industrial scale @xcite , electrospinning has attracted the attention of a large community of researchers , including modeling and computational aspects @xcite .",
    "in fact , computational models provide a useful tool to elucidate the physics of electrospinning and provide information which may be used for the design of new electrospinning experiments .",
    "numerical simulations can also help improving the capability of predicting the role of the key process parameters and exert a better control on the resulting nanofiber structure .",
    "although some authors used dissipative particle dynamics mesoscale simulation methods @xcite , various models treat the jet filament as a series of discrete elements ( _ beads _ ) obeying the equations of continuum mechanics @xcite .",
    "each bead is subject to different types of interactions , such as long - range coulomb repulsion , viscoelastic drag , the force related to the external electric field , and so on .",
    "the main aim of such models is to capture the complexity of the resulting dynamics and to provide the set of parameters driving the process .",
    "the effect of fast - oscillating loads on the bending instability has been also explored in an extensive computational study @xcite .    in recent works",
    ", we extended the unidimensional bead - spring model , developed by pontrelli _",
    "@xcite , to include a nonlinear dissipative - perturbing force which models the effects of the air drag force .",
    "this has been accomplished by adding a random and a dissipative force to the equations of motion . in particular , we investigated both linear and non - linear langevin - like models to describe air drag effects @xcite .    encompassing the previous efforts , in this paper we present , along with the overall model , a detailed algorithm and the corresponding fortran code , jetspin , specifically designed to simulate the electrospinning process under a variety of different conditions and experimental settings .",
    "this comprehensive platform is devised in such a way to handle a variety of different cases via a suitable choice of the input variables .",
    "the framework is developed to exploit several computational architectures , both serial and parallel . with most of parameters taken from relevant literature in the field ,",
    "a number of test cases have been carried out and an excellent agreement with experiments has been found .",
    "jetspin , as open - source software , can be used to carry out a systematic sensitivity analysis over a broad range of parameter values .",
    "the results of simulations provide valuable insight on the physics of the process and can be used to assess experimental procedures for an optimal design of the equipment and to control processing strategies for technologically advanced nanofibers .",
    "jetspin is written in free format fortran90 , and it consists of approximately 140 subroutines .",
    "the source exploits the modular approach provided by the programming language .",
    "all the variables having in common description of certain features or method are grouped in modules .",
    "the convention of explicit type declaration is adopted , and all the arguments passed in calling sequences of functions or subroutines have defined intent .",
    "we use the private and public accessibility attributes in order to decrease error - proneness in programming .",
    "the main routines have been gathered in the ` main.f90 ` file , which drives all the cpu - intensive computations needed for the capabilities mentioned below .",
    "the variables describing the main features of jets ( position , velocity , etc . ) are declared in the ` nanojet_mod.f90 ` file , which also contains the main subroutines for the memory management of the fundamental data of the simulated system . since",
    "the size system is strictly time - dependent , jetspin exploits the dynamic array allocation features of fortran90 to assign the necessary array dimensions .",
    "in particular , the size system is modified by the routines ` add_jetbead ` and ` erase_jetbead ` , while the decision of the main array size , declared as ` mxnpjet ` , is handled by the routine ` reallocate_jet ` .",
    "the sizes of various service bookkeeping arrays are handled within a parallel implementation strategy , which exploits few dedicated subroutines ( see sec [ sec : parallelization ] ) .",
    "all the implemented time integrators are written in the ` integrator_mod.f90 ` file , which contains the routine ` driver_integrator ` to select the proper integrator , as indicated in the input file .",
    "all the terms of equations of motion for the implemented model ( see sec [ sec : overview - of - model ] ) are computed by routines located in the ` eom_mod.f90 ` file , which call other subroutines in the files ` coulomb_force_mod.f90 ` , ` viscoelastic_force_mod.f90 ` and ` support_functions_mod.f90 ` . a summarizing scheme of the main jetspin program in the ` main.f90 ` file has been sketched in fig[fig : scheme - jetspin ] .",
    "the user can carry out simulations of electrospun jets without a detailed understanding of the structure of jetspin code .",
    "all the parameters governing the system can be defined in the input file ( see sec [ sec : description - of - the - input ] ) , which is read by routines located in the ` io_mod.f90 ` and ` parse_mod.f90 ` files . instead , the user should be acquainted with the model described in sec [ sec : overview - of - model ] .",
    "the content of the output file is completely customizable by the input file as described in sec [ sec : description - of - the - input ] , and it can report different time - averaged observables computed by routines of the module ` statistic_mod ` ( see sec [ sec : description - of - the - output ] ) .",
    "the routines in the ` error_mod.f90 ` file can display various warning or error banners on computer terminal , so that the user can easily correct the most common mistakes in the input file .",
    "jetspin is supplied as a single unix compressed ( tarred and gzipped ) directory with four sub - directories .",
    "all the source code files are contained in the _ source _ sub - directory .",
    "the _ examples _ sub - directory contains different test cases that can help the user to edit new input files . the _ build _ sub - directory stores a unix ` makefile ` that assembles the executable versions of the code both in serial and parallel version with different compilers .",
    "note that jetspin may be compiled on any unix platform .",
    "the ` makefile ` should be copied ( and eventually modified ) into the _ source _ sub - directory , where the code is compiled and linked .",
    "a list of targets for several common workstations and parallel computers can be used by the command `` ` make target ` '' , where ` target ` is one of the options reported in tab [ tab : targets ] . on windows system we advice the user to compile jetspin under the command - line interface cygwin @xcite .",
    "finally , the binary executable file can be run in the _ execute _ sub - directory .",
    "the parallel infrastructure of jetspin incorporates the necessary data distribution and communication structures .",
    "the parallel strategy underlying jetspin is the replicated data ( rd ) scheme@xcite , where fundamental data of the simulated system are reproduced on all processing nodes . in simulations of electrospinning , the fundamental data consist of position , velocity , and viscoelastic stress arrays at each bead in which the jet is discretised ( see below sec [ sec : overview - of - model ] ) .",
    "further data defining mass and charge of each bead are also replicated .",
    "however , all auxiliary data are distributed in equal portion of data ( as much as possible ) for each processor . despite other parallel strategies being available such as the domain decomposition@xcite",
    ", our experience has shown that such volume of data is by no means prohibitive on current parallel computers .    by the rd scheme ,",
    "we implement the following parallel procedure : 1 ) a set of arrays ( in the following text referred to as global arrays ) containing position , velocity , viscoelastic stress , mass and charge of each bead is replicated on each processing node .",
    "2 ) the routine ` set_chunk ` distributes the computational work over all the nodes by assigning a nanofiber chunk to each node .",
    "in particular , the first and last beads of the jet chunk dealt by the @xmath0 node are declared as ` mystart ` and ` myend ` , which have different values for each node .",
    "3 ) each node evolves in time the nanofiber for its assigned chunk of jet .",
    "thus , the set of global arrays are updated only for the jet chunk which is handled by the specific node , while all the remaining values are set to zero . at this stage",
    "each node exploits service bookkeeping arrays which are not replicated , and whose size is dynamically allocated on the basis of the chunk size in order to save memory space .",
    "4 ) finally , global summation routines are employed in order to make the updated data of the global arrays available to all nodes .",
    "note that we adopt in jetspin a simple strategy of communication between nodes , which is handled by global summation routines .",
    "the module ` version_mod ` located in the ` parallel_version_mod.f90 ` file contains all the global communication routines which exploit the mpi ( message passing interface ) library .",
    "it is worth stressing that a fortran90 compiler and an mpi implementation for the specific machine architecture are required in order to compile jetspin in parallel mode .",
    "an alternative version of the module ` version_mod ` is located in the ` serial_version_mod.f90 ` file , and it can be easily selected by appropriate targets in the ` makefile ` at compile time ( see tab [ tab : targets ] ) . by selecting this version , jetspin can also be run on serial computers without modification , even though the code has been designed to run on parallel computers .",
    "the size system is strictly time - dependent as mentioned in sec [ sec : structure ] and , therefore , the memory of various service bookkeeping arrays is dynamically distributed over all the processing nodes . in particular , the bookkeeping array size ,",
    "declared as ` mxchunk ` , is managed by the routine ` set_mxchunk ` .",
    "all the beads of the discretised jet are assigned at every time step to a specific node by the routine ` set_chunk ` , and their temporary data are stored in bookkeeping arrays belonging to the assigned node .",
    "it is worth stressing that the communication latency makes the parallelization efficiency strictly dependent on the system size .",
    "therefore , we only advice the use of jetspin in parallel mode whenever the user expects a system size with at least 50 beads for each node ( further details in sec [ sec : performance ] ) .",
    "the model implemented in jetspin is an extension of the lagrangian discrete model introduced by reneker et al . @xcite .",
    "the model provides a compromise of efficiency and accuracy by representing the filament as a series of @xmath1 beads ( jet beads ) at mutual distance @xmath2 connected by viscoelastic elements .",
    "the length @xmath2 is typically larger than the cross - sectional radius of the filament , but smaller than the characteristic lengths of other observables of interest ( e.g. curvature radius ) .",
    "each @xmath0 bead has mass @xmath3 and charge @xmath4 ( not necessarily equal for all the beads ) .",
    "evaporation has been neglected since it is not expected to introduce qualitative changes the jet dynamics @xcite .",
    "however , the effect of solvent evaporation likely leads to a slight solidification of the jet , altering the rheological parameters of the polymer solution .",
    "this latter issue was addressed by an ad - hoc evaporation model proposed by yarin et al .",
    "@xcite , whose implementation in jetspin will be considered in future releases .",
    "the jet is modelled as a viscoelastic maxwell fluid , so that the stress @xmath5 for the element connecting bead @xmath6 with bead @xmath7 is given by the viscoelastic constitutive equation :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the length between the bead @xmath6 with the bead @xmath7 , @xmath10 is the elastic modulus , @xmath11 is the viscosity of the fluid jet , and @xmath12 is time . given @xmath13 the cross - sectional radius of the filament at the bead @xmath6 , the viscoleastic force @xmath14 pulling bead @xmath6 back to @xmath15 and towards @xmath7 is    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the unit vector pointing bead @xmath6 from bead @xmath15 .",
    "the surface tension force @xmath18 for the @xmath0 bead is given by    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the surface tension coefficient , @xmath21 is the local curvature , and @xmath22 is the unit vector pointing the center of the local curvature from bead @xmath6 . note the force @xmath18 is acting to restore the rectilinear shape of the bending part of the jet .    in the electrospinning experimental configuration",
    "an intense electric potential @xmath23 is applied between the spinneret and a conducting collector located at distance @xmath24 from the injection point . as consequence",
    ", each @xmath0 bead undergoes the electric force    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the unit vector pointing the collector from the spinneret assuming a vertical @xmath27 axis starting at the spinneret ( @xmath28 ) . note that in ren model the intense electric potential @xmath23 is assumed to be static in order to avoid the computationally expensive integration of poisson equation , whereas in reality @xmath23 is depending on the net charge of the jet so as to maintain constant the potential at the electrodes .",
    "the latter issue was elegantly addressed by kowalewski et al .",
    "@xcite , and its implementation in jetspin will be planned .",
    "furthermore , a model using a lattice method for electromagnetic wave propagation @xcite is planned to be implemented in future releases in order to deal with electrospinning process in the presence of oscillating electric fields .",
    "the net coulomb force @xmath29 acting on the @xmath0 bead from all the other beads is given by    @xmath30    where @xmath31^{1/2}$ ] , and @xmath32 is the unit vector pointing the @xmath0 bead from @xmath33 bead ..",
    "although the reneker model provides a reasonable description for the spiral motion of the jet , the last term @xmath29 introduces mathematical inconsistencies due to the discretization of the fiber into point - charges .",
    "indeed , the charge induces a field on the outer shell of the fiber and not on the center line ( as in the implemented model ) .",
    "different approaches were developed to overcome this issue which usually imply strong approximations@xcite .",
    "other strategies use a less crude approximation by accounting for the actual electrostatic form factors between two interacting sections of a charged fiber@xcite or involving more sophisticated methods which exploit the tree - code hierarchical force calculation algorithm@xcite .",
    "the implementation of methods based on tree - code hierarchical force calculation algorithm in jetspin will be considered in future .",
    "although usually much smaller than the other driving forces , the body force due to the gravity is computed in the model by the usual expression    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is the gravitational acceleration .",
    "the combined action of these forces governs the elongation of the jet according to the newton s equation :    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the velocity of the @xmath0 bead .",
    "the velocity @xmath37 satisfies the kinematic relation :    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the position vector of the @xmath0 bead , @xmath40 .",
    "the three eqs [ eq : stress - ode ] , [ eq : force - eom ] and [ eq : pos - eom ] form the set of equations of motion ( eom ) governing the time evolution of system .",
    "depite the experimental evidence that the air drag affects the jet dynamics @xcite , the effects of aerodynamics are neglected at this stage . an extended stochastic model , recently developed in refs @xcite , including air drag effects is already planned for the next version of jetspin .",
    "the spinneret nozzle is represented by a single mass - less point of charge @xmath41 fixed at @xmath28 ( nozzle bead ) .",
    "its charge @xmath41 is assumed equal to the mean charge value of the jet beads .",
    "such charged point can be also interpreted as a small portion of jet which is fixed at the nozzle . in jetspin",
    "it is possible to add small perturbations to the @xmath42 and @xmath43 coordinates of the nozzle bead in order to model fast mechanical oscillations of the spinneret@xcite . given the initial position of the nozzle    @xmath44",
    "@xmath45    the equations of motion for the nozzle bead are    @xmath46    @xmath47    where @xmath48 denotes the amplitude of the perturbation , while @xmath49 and @xmath50 are its frequency and initial phase , respectively .",
    "the jet insertion at the nozzle is modelled as follows . for sake of simplicity ,",
    "let us consider a simulation which starts with only two bodies : a single mass - less point fixed at @xmath28 representing the spinneret nozzle , and a bead modelling an initial jet segment of mass @xmath3 and charge @xmath51 located at distance @xmath52 from the nozzle along the @xmath27 axis .",
    "here , @xmath52 denotes the length step used to discretise the jet in a sequence of beads .",
    "the starting jet bead is assumed to have a cross - sectional radius @xmath53 , defined as the radius of the filament at the nozzle before the stretching process . applying the condition of conservation of the jet volume ,",
    "the relation @xmath54 is valid for any @xmath0 bead .",
    "furthermore , the starting jet bead has an initial velocity @xmath55 along the @xmath27 axis equal to the bulk fluid velocity in the syringe needle .",
    "once this traveling jet bead is a distance of @xmath56 away from the nozzle , a new jet bead ( third body ) is placed at distance @xmath52 from the nozzle along the straight line joining the two previous bodies .",
    "let us now label @xmath15 the farthest bead from the nozzle , and @xmath6 the last inserted bead .",
    "the @xmath0 bead is inserted with the initial velocity @xmath57 , where @xmath58 denotes the dragging velocity computed as    @xmath59    here , the dragging velocity should be interpreted as an extra term which accounts for the drag effect of the electrospun jet on the last inserted segment .",
    "note that the actual dragging velocity definition was chosen in order to not alter the strain velocity term @xmath60 of eq [ eq : stress - ode ] before and after the bead insertion .      in jetspin all the variables",
    "are automatically rescaled and stored in dimensionless units . in order to adopt a dimensionless form of the equations of motion",
    ", we use the dimensionless scaling procdure proposed by reneker et al.@xcite .",
    "we define a characteristic length    @xmath61    where we write the charge @xmath62 as @xmath63 , denoting @xmath64 the electric volume charge density of the filament .",
    "further , we divide the time @xmath12 and the stress @xmath65 by their respective characteristic scales reported in tab[tab : tabella - adimensionale ] . by using the volume conservation condition , and introducing the dimensionless variables in eom",
    ", we obtain :    @xmath66    @xmath67    @xmath68    where we used the dimensionless derived variables and groups defined in tab[tab : tabella - adimensionale ] .",
    "it is worth stressing that the viscoelastic and surface tension force terms are slightly different from the dimensionless form provided by reneker et al .",
    "@xcite , since we are considering the most general case @xmath69    similarly , the equations of motion of the nozzle become    @xmath70    @xmath71    with the dimensionless parameter @xmath72 defined in tab[tab : tabella - adimensionale ] .      in order to integrate the homogeneous differential eom we discretise time as @xmath73 with @xmath74 , where @xmath75 denotes the number of sub - intervals .",
    "in jetspin three different integration schemes can be exploited : the first - order accurate euler scheme , the second - order accurate heun scheme ( sometimes called second - order accurate runge - kutta ) , and the fourth - order accurate runge - kutta scheme@xcite .",
    "the user can select a specific scheme by using appropriate keys in the input file , as described in sec [ sec : description - of - the - input ] .",
    "in addition , the time step @xmath76 is automatically rescaled by the quantity @xmath77 , in accordance with the mentioned dimensionless scaling convention .",
    "in order to run jetspin simulations an input file has to be prepared , which is free - form with no sequence field and case - insensitive .",
    "the input file has to be named ` input.dat ` , and it contains the selection of the model system , integration scheme directives , specification of various parameters for the model , and output directives .",
    "the input file does not requires a specific order of key directives , and it is read by the input parsing module .",
    "every line is treated as a command sentence ( record ) .",
    "records beginning with the symbol # ( commented ) and blank lines are not processed , and may be added to aid readability .",
    "each record is read in words ( directives and additional keywords and numbers ) , which are recognized as such by separation by one or more space characters .    as in the example given in ` input test ` , the last record is a ` finish ` directive , which marks the end of the input data .",
    "before the ` finish ` directive , a wide list of directives may be inserted ( see appendix a ) . the key ` systype ` should be used to set the jet model . in jetspin",
    "two models are available : 1 ) the one dimensional model similar to the model of sec [ sec : overview - of - model ] but assuming the jet to be straight along the @xmath26 axis , and , therefore , neglecting the surface tension force @xmath18 ; 2 ) the three dimensional model described in sec [ sec : overview - of - model ] . internally these options are handled by the integer variable ` systype ` , which assumes the values explained in appendix a. further details of the 1-d model can be found in refs @xcite .",
    "a series of variables are mandatory and have to be defined .",
    "for example , ` timestep ` , ` final time ` , ` initial length ` , etc .",
    "( see underlined directives in appendix a ) .",
    "a missed definition of any mandatory variable will call an error banner on the terminal . given the mandatory directive ` initial length ` , the user can define the initial jet geometry in two ways : 1 ) the discretization step length is specified by the directive ` resolution ` , which causes automatically the setting of the jet segments number ( the number of segment in which the jet is discretised ) ; 2 ) the jet segments number is declared by the directive ` points ` , while the value of the discretization step length is automatically set by the program ( as in example * input 3 * ) .",
    "the directive ` cutoff ` indicates the length of the upper and lower proximal jet sections , which interact via coulomb force on any bead .",
    "it is worth stressing that the length value is set at the nozzle , so that the effective cutoff increases along the simulation as the jet is stretched",
    ".    the user should pay special attention in choosing the time integration step given by the directive ` timestep ` , whose detailed considerations are provided in subsec [ sub : numerical accuracy ] .",
    "the reader is referred to appendix a for a complete listing of all directives defining the electrospinning parameters .",
    "not all these quantities are mandatory , but the user is informed that whenever a quantity is missed , it is usually assumed equal to zero by default ( exceptions are stressed in appendix a ) .",
    "note that in the current software version all the quantities have to be expressed in centimetergramsecond unit system ( e.g. charge in statcoulomb , electric potential in statvolt , etc . ) .",
    "a series of specific directives causes the writing of output files ( see appendix a ) . in jetspin two output files can be written : 1 ) the file ` statdat.dat ` containing time - dependent statistical data of simulated process ; 2 ) the file ` traj.xyz ` reporting the jet trajectory in xyz file format .",
    "various statistical data can be written on the file ` statdat.dat ` , and the user can select them in input using the directive ` printstat list ` followed by appropriate symbolic strings , whose list with corresponding meanings is reported in appendix b. the statistical observables will be printed as mean values averaged over the time interval indicated by the directive ` print time ` , and reported on the same line following the order specified in input file . in the same way , a list of statistical data can be printed on computer terminal using the directive ` print list ` followed by the symbolic strings of appendix b.    the file ` traj.xyz ` is written as a continuous series of xyz format frames taken at time interval , so that it can be read by suitable visualization programs ( e.g. vmd - visual molecular dynamics @xcite , ucsf chimera @xcite , etc . ) to generate animations .",
    "the number of elements contained in the file is kept constant equal to the value specified by the directive ` print xyz maxnum ` , since few programs ( e.g. vmd ) do not manage a variable number of elements along simulations . if the actual number of beads is lower than the given constant `",
    "maxnum ` , the extra elements are printed in the origin point .",
    "here , we show three different examples of simulations . each example addresses a specific issue of the jet model : 1 ) the choice of a suitable time step for the integration scheme ; 2 ) the choice of a suitable length step for the jet discretization in order to properly approach the continuum jet description ; 3 ) fidelity of the model in reproducing experimental data .",
    "now , we intend to assess a typical time step value , @xmath76 , for the integration schemes implemented in jetspin . to this purpose , exploiting the time reversibility and using dimensionless quantities , we integrate eqs [ eq : eom - a1 ] , [ eq : eom - a2 ] and [ eq : eom - a3 ] forward for @xmath75 time steps , and backward for further @xmath75 time steps in the interval @xmath78 and @xmath79 . finally , we compute the average absolute error    @xmath80    where @xmath81 is the dimensionless position ( defined in subsec [ sub : introduction - of - dimensionless ] ) along the @xmath27 axis of the bead ( describing the jet ) from the nozzle ( located at zero ) . here ,",
    "@xmath82 and @xmath83 denote respectively the position of the jet bead at the beginning and at the end of the time integration .",
    "note a perfect integrator ideally recovers @xmath82 after @xmath84 time steps , so that we should obtain @xmath85 .",
    "the procedure was performed on the input example labeled * input 1 * , and it was repeated for different values of time step @xmath86 .",
    "this input file provides the dimensionless parameter values @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 , which have been already used as reference case in refs @xcite .",
    "all the simulations start with the initial conditions @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 . for sake of completeness",
    ", we report in fig[fig : time - evol-7.1 ] the time evolution of the position @xmath81 and velocity @xmath93 .",
    "as already noted in refs @xcite , we identify two sequential stages in the elongation process . in the first regime",
    ", we observe a little increase of @xmath93 which rises up to achieve a quasi stationary point , where the viscoelastic force balances the sum of the coulomb and electric forces ( due to the external electric field ) , providing a nearly zero value of the total force .",
    "then , in the second stage the velocity trend comes to a near linearly increasing regime . in fig[fig : accuracy-7.1 ] we report the logarithmic trend of @xmath94 versus @xmath86 for the three different integration schemes . here , the characteristic time and length scales are equal to @xmath95 and @xmath96 , respectively .",
    "as expected , we note a    precision of the runge - kutta scheme , while the computational cost increases by increasing the accuracy of the integration scheme , as discussed in more detail in sec [ sec : performance ] .",
    "the euler s method shows a lower numerical accuracy at larger values of @xmath86 , in particular close to @xmath97 .",
    "the heun scheme provides a compromise of efficiency and accuracy , keeping the absolute error @xmath94 lower than @xmath98 already for time step @xmath99 .",
    "however , a good practice would be to perform preliminary tests of accuracy and efficiency for any specific case , since the accuracy is dependent on the magnitude of the dimensionless parameters .",
    "the discretization length step plays an important role , since we describe a continuous material system ( the jet ) by a series of discrete bodies .",
    "in particular , decreasing the discretization length step @xmath52 , we approach the continuous description of the problem , and , therefore , an asymptotic behavior should be observed .    here",
    ", we run the input example labeled * input 2 * with different values of length step @xmath52 . in particular , we probe the interval of @xmath52 values from @xmath100 to @xmath101 .",
    "all the simulations started with the initial conditions @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 , and we integrated the eom for 2 seconds . in all the simulations we observed an initial drift of the observables describing the electrospinning process .",
    "this drift occurs in the early stage of dynamics , when the jet has not reached the collector yet .",
    "after the jet touches the collector , the observables fluctuate around a constant mean value , providing a stationary regime .",
    "as example , we report in fig[fig : dragvel-7.2 ] the time evolution of the dragging velocity term @xmath58 .",
    "note that here @xmath58 is not equal to zero as in the previous case , since we have activated the injection of new beads by the directive ` inserting yes ` in the input file . in fig[fig : rad - asy-7.2 ] and fig[fig : current - asy-7.2 ] we report the trend of two observables , average fiber radius and current measured at the collector in stationary regime , as function of the dimensionless parameter @xmath105 , which increases by decreasing @xmath52 ( see tab[tab : tabella - adimensionale ] and eq [ eq : length - scale ] ) .",
    "in particular , we observe a slow asymptotic behavior of the two statistical data .",
    "further discussions on the asymptotic behavior can be found in refs @xcite .",
    "it is worth stressing that the computational cost increases rapidly by decreasing @xmath52 , and , therefore , the user should cleverly tune the length step @xmath52 in order to achieve a good compromise between efficiency and accuracy .",
    "we report in fig[fig : time - evol-7.2 ] the time evolution of the position @xmath27 and velocity @xmath106 for a generic jet segment ( jet bead ) falling from the nozzle in stationary regime .",
    "similarly to the previous case , we identify two sequential stages in the elongation process : the first biased by the sum of the viscoelastic and coulomb forces , and the second dominated by the external electric field . here",
    "the main difference compared to the previous case is the presence of two quasi stationary points instead of one .",
    "this fact is due to the larger viscoelastic force exerted by the new jet segments ( beads ) inserted at the nozzle .",
    "in fact , the viscoelastic force has a braking effect between the two quasi stationary points .",
    "furthermore , comparing with the previous case we observe here that the presence of a non zero dragging velocity term @xmath58 anticipates the second stage .",
    "the electrospinning of polyvinylpyrrolidone ( pvp ) nanofibers is a prototypical process , which has been largely investigated in literature.@xcite recently , its process dynamics was experimentally probed at an ultra - high time rate resolution by montinaro et al.@xcite here , we simulate the electrospinning process of pvp solutions .",
    "then , the theoretical results predicted by the models are compared with the aforementioned experimental data . in particular , we reproduce an experiment in which a solution of pvp ( molecular weight = 1300 kda ) is prepared by a mixture of ethanol and water ( 17:3 v : v ) , at a concentration of about 2.5 wt% .",
    "the applied voltage is in a range around 10 kv , and the collector is placed at distance 16 cm from the nozzle , which has radius @xmath107micron ( further details are provided in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . as rheological properties of such system we consider the zero - shear viscosity @xmath108 @xcite , the elastic modulus @xmath109 @xcite , and the surface tension @xmath110 @xcite .",
    "we use for the simulation a viscosity value @xmath11 which is two order of magnitude larger than the zero - shear viscosity @xmath111 reported , since the strong longitudinal flows we are dealing with can lead to an increase of the extensional viscosity from @xmath111 , as already observed in literature.@xcite the mass density is equal to @xmath112 , while the charge density was estimated by experimental observations of the current measured at the nozzle . for convenience , all the simulation parameters are summarized in tab[tab : simulation - param ] .",
    "we show here the results three independent simulations with different values of potential @xmath23 between the nozzle and the collector : 6 kv , 9 kv and 11 kv , respectively .",
    "the simulations were carried out with a time step of @xmath113 s , the eom were integrated in time for 20 million steps by using the second order accurate heun scheme .",
    "as example , one of the three input files is reported as labeled * input 3*. note that we have activated the perturbation module by the directive ` perturb yes ` in the input file , in order to model a mechanical perturbation at the nozzle .",
    "here , we use the frequency of the perturbation value @xmath49 proposed by reneker et al.@xcite    in all the simulations , we recognize three different stages of the electrospun jet : 1 ) extensione along a straight line over a few centimeters , 2 ) slight perturbation from the linear path leading to bending instability ; 3 ) fully three - dimensional motion out from the stretching axis .",
    "two snapshots of the simulated jet are reported on the left of fig[fig : compare-7.3 ] , which can be compared with two high - frame - rate micrographs ( on the right of the figure ) collected during electrospinning experiments @xcite .",
    "the two shown snapshots correspond to an early stage and a later regime of instabilities , respectively .",
    "we note a general good agreement between the simulation results and experimental measurements .",
    "furthermore , we monitored the velocity of the jet ejected at the nozzle , whose value was estimated between @xmath114 and @xmath115 m / s for the case @xmath116kv .",
    "this is also pretty close to the experimental observations which locate the velocity around 2.6 m / s @xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , bending instabilities play an important role in the electrospinning process , since they increase the path traveled by the jet from the nozzle to the collector with beneficial effect in terms of yielding a smaller polymer fiber radius .",
    "thus , we measure the instantaneous angular aperture ( @xmath117 ) of the instability cone ( see fig[fig : definizione - angolo ] ) in the range of potential @xmath23 imposed between the nozzle and the collector ( from 6 up to 11 v ) .",
    "the @xmath117 values are in the range 30 - 36 degrees , which is consistent with the experimentally measured range 29 - 37 degrees reported in ref @xcite .",
    "the performance of the underlying numerical routines in jetspin is an important aspect to take into account , affecting the choice of the value of the discretization length step allowing the jet to be discretised without loosing accuracy . in simulating electrospinning processes",
    ", this factor is especially important given that upon decreasing the discretization length step the systems size ( number of beads ) increases with linear dependence .",
    "furthermore , the code currently spends of order @xmath118 operations to compute the coulomb force ( @xmath119 is the number of beads ) .",
    "the last point could be addressed in future versions of the code by using strategies like linked cell or tree - code algorithm .    in this section ,",
    "we compare the cpu wall - clock time required to run the * input 1 * and * input 3 * with the three different integration schemes implemented in jetspin . for the * input 1 * case ,",
    "we note that the increase of cpu wall - clock time is strongly dependent on the greater complexity of the chosen integrator scheme ( see tab[tab : cpu - time ] ) .",
    "in particular , we note that the heun and runge - kutta schemes require around two and four times the cpu wall - clock time cost of the euler integrator , respectively .",
    "a similar trend is observed also for the * input 3 * case .",
    "however , the user should also consider the different numerical accuracy provided by the three schemes , as already discussed in subsec [ sub : numerical accuracy ] .    we probe the parallel efficiency of jetspin .",
    "in particular , we run the * input 3 * at different values of discretization length step and collector - nozzle distance .",
    "thus , we probe different system sizes corresponding to different numbers of beads , which are used to discretise the jet .",
    "further , the procedure is repeated with different number of processing cores , so that the efficiency of the implemented parallel strategy is investigated . in order to perform a quantitative analysis",
    ", we compute the speedup ( @xmath120 )    @xmath121    where @xmath122 stands for the cpu wall - clock time of the code in serial mode , and @xmath123 the cpu wall - clock time of the code in parallel mode executed by the number of processors denoted @xmath124 .",
    "we also estimate the parallel efficiency ( @xmath125 ) defined as    @xmath126    the trends of these two estimators versus the number of processors are reported in fig[fig : speedup ] and fig[fig : parallel - eff ] .",
    "note that only for the largest system size we observe a quasi linear trend of @xmath120 ( see fig[fig : speedup ] ) , while in all the other cases a sub - linear behavior is evident ( note that the speedup should ideally be equal to the number of processors ) .",
    "this is not surprising , since the communication latency strays actually the speedup from the linear trend .",
    "note that deviation from the linear trend is larger for smaller system sizes with a lower cost - benefit ratio .",
    "this is usually due to the communication latency which deteriorates the performance whenever the number of beads assigned to each processor is not sufficiently high to offset the communication overheads .",
    "this is evident in fig[fig : parallel - eff ] , where the parallel efficiency is usually larger than 0.8 ( 80% ) only if the system size provides at least 50 beads per each processor . as a consequence",
    ", the user should always consider the number of beads handled by each processor in order to run efficiently jetspin in parallel mode .",

    "however , it is worth stressing that all commercial rights derived from this software are entirely owned by the authors as reported in paragraph 4 of the osl .",
    "a copy of the code may be obtained as zipped and tarred file at the website : http://www.nanojets.eu/. all enquiries regarding how to obtain a copy of jetspin should be addressed to the authors .",
    "we have presented jetspin , a new open - source software for the numerical simulation of electrospinning phenomena .",
