    "when did the disks of ordinary galaxies form ?",
    "this is the central question to be addressed in my talk . at this meeting ,",
    "evidence was presented suggesting the _ bulk _ of the disk population was in place by @xmath0 @xmath3 1 . while mergers between disks and infall of gas onto disks undoubtedly occur subsequently , the surveys by ellis , lilly , and faber all rule out substantial changes in the stellar content of disks since @xmath0 = 1 .",
    "further evidence against significant changes in the disk populations comes from the galaxy . from her studies of stars in the thick disk , wyse ( this volume ) concluded that the galaxy has not undergone a major merger during the past 12 gyr . provided",
    "the galaxy is typical , this adds strong support to the idea that disks , in this case the thick disk , were in place _ before _",
    "@xmath0 = 1 .    how long before ?",
    "this question is crucial since hierarchical cosmologies predict that only a small fraction of current disk galaxies were in place by @xmath0 @xmath3 3 .",
    "rather , cdm models predict the bulk of the protogalactic mass distribution to be in low - mass subgalactic progenitors at these redshifts .",
    "this is a generic property of cdm cosmogonies , and one that should be tested .    in my talk",
    "i will describe observations that not only test hierarchical theories of galaxy formation , but also probe the nature of the protogalactic mass distribution . the work centers on the damped systems , because of compelling evidence that these h i layers supply the baryons comprising visible stars in current galaxies ( cf .",
    "storrie - lombardi & wolfe 2000 ) .",
    "therefore , my talk focuses on gas rather than stars ( but see @xmath4 4 ) .",
    "gas provides a more accurate picture of the baryonic content of protogalaxies because most of the baryons at high @xmath0 were gas .",
    "the evidence for rotating disks stems from accurate velocity profiles of metal lines that j. x. prochaska and i have acquired with hires , the echelle spectrograph on the keck i telescope . along with profiles kindly supplied by w. l. w. sargent",
    ", we have acquired accurate profiles for low - ions such as fe@xmath5 and si@xmath5 for over 40 high-@xmath0 damped systems .",
    "low ions are crucial as they trace the neutral gas which gives rise to damped lines .    the velocity profiles ( see wolfe 1999 ; prochaska & wolfe 1997 ) consist of multiple narrow - velocity components spanning velocity intervals between 20 and 290 .",
    "the components are not randomly distributed in velocity space .",
    "rather , the component with the largest optical depth is at the profile edge in 75 @xmath6 of the profiles with @xmath1 40 .",
    "the most straightforward explanation for this `` edge leading '' asymmetry is that the damped sightlines traverse rotating disks in which the density of absorbing clouds decreases exponentially in the radial and vertical directions with scale lengths @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( prochaska & wolfe 1997 ) .",
    "figure 1 shows how `` edge - leading '' profiles naturally arise from randomly selected impact parameters .",
    "the figure also shows why decreases with increasing impact parameter .",
    "while other mechanisms have been suggested to explain the profile asymmetries ( e.g. haehnelt 1997 ) , exponential rotating disks provide the most straightforward explanation .    using monte carlo techniques , we tested the semi - analytic models of mo ( 1998 ) in which centrifugally - supported disks are at the centers of dark - matter halos with mass distribution determined by press - schecter functions and cdm power spectra .",
    "we generated synthetic velocity profiles by letting randomly selected sightlines traverse randomly - oriented exponential disks with rotation speeds equal to @xmath9 at the virial radius .",
    "we found the predicted by single - disk cdm models can not account for the significant fraction of between 100 and 300 , since the median predicted by single - disk cdm models are less than 100 .",
    "however , the tf model in which the input distribution of at high redshift is determined by the tully - fisher relation and the schecter luminosity function is compatible with the data owing to the larger fraction of disks @xmath1 100 ( wolfe & prochaska 2000 ) .",
    "thick disks with @xmath8@xmath3 0.3@xmath7 are required to obtain @xmath1 100 .",
    "we also used the hires velocity profiles to determine the metallicities of damped systems ( prochaska & wolfe 2000 ) . combining metallicity and kinematic information we find a phenomenon that bears upon the presence of rotating disks at high redshifts . and",
    "this is the clear deficit at @xmath0 @xmath10 3 of metal - poor systems with @xmath1 100 shown in figure 2a .",
    "the absence of these systems is real and not an artifact due to selection effects .",
    "this is indicated by the presence of such systems in the @xmath0 @xmath1 3 sample ( fig .",
    "moreover , dust would lead to the absence of metal - rich rather than metal - poor systems .",
    "the enlarged sample of [ fe / h ] abundances strengthens the case first made with a smaller sample of [ zn / h ] , pairs ( wolfe & prochaska 1998 ) .",
    "we interpret this effect to arise from negative radial gradients in [ fe / h ] in rotating disks .",
    "high [ fe / h ] are required at small radii because low impact parameters , @xmath11 , are a necessary condition for large ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . we find a wider distribution of @xmath11 contributes to systems with smaller .",
    "thus , at small , the lower [ fe / h ] come from low [ fe / h ] at large radii , while higher [ fe / h ] again come from small @xmath11 but in disks that are more face - on . _",
    "therefore , the increase in scatter of [ fe / h ] with decreasing is naturally produced by the rotating disk models .",
    "_ however , since variations in metallicity in nearby spirals rarely span more than 1 dex , a positive correlation between [ fe / h ] and @xmath12 would help to explain the full effect .",
    "figure 3 plots abundance ratios of various elements versus [ fe / h ] for damped systems and stars in the galaxy thick disk .",
    "comparison with the thick disk is motivated by the large vertical scale - heights required in our model gaseous disks , since this raises the possibility that high-@xmath0 damped systems are the progenitors of thick stellar disks . to demonstrate the plausibility of this hypothesis",
    ", we showed that the metal - rich damped systems contain sufficient baryons at mean metallicity , @xmath13>$ ] = @xmath14 0.6 , to account for the the mass content and metallicity of thick disks ( wolfe & prochaska 1998 ) . here",
    "i discuss further evidence in support of this idea .",
    "the abundances in figure 3 were inferred from hires data obtained for a kinematically selected sample of stars in the thick disk and our sample of damped systems .",
    "the stellar atmospheres programs used to deduce the thick disk abundances are described in prochaska ( 2000 ) .",
    "the figure plots results for @xmath15 , fe peak , and light elements . as [ fe / h ] increases we find tentative evidence that [ x / fe ] for the damped systems evolves toward [ x / fe ] for the thick disk when x = si , zn , and mn .",
    "the results are especially striking for [ mn / fe ] .",
    "we find two possible interpretations for these trends .",
    "the first is a nucleosynthetic explanation .",
    "lu ( 1996 ) argued that the damped systems exhibit classic type ii sn patterns with enhanced [ @xmath15/fe ] ratios , deficient [ mn / fe ] ratios ( due to the odd - even effect ) , and unpeculiar [ cr / fe ] and [ ni / fe ] ratios .",
    "the problem with this argument was that [ zn / fe ] = 0 in stars with a wide range in metallicities ; whereas [ zn / fe ] @xmath3 0.3 in damped systems . with our more accurate spectroscopy",
    "we find [ zn / fe ] = 0.1 in thick - disk stars where [ fe / h ] = @xmath14 0.6 .",
    "and there is tentative evidence that [ zn / fe ] is higher for thick - disk stars with lower [ fe / h ] . that zn does not track fe is not surprising since recent calculations indicate zn is not produced in the same type i sn responsible for most of the fe .",
    "rather , zn may be produced in neutrino - driven winds in type ii sn ( hoffman 1996 ) ) .",
    "therefore , it is likely that the [ zn / fe ] ratio in damped systems is partially nucleosynthetic in origin . on",
    "the other hand , pettini ( 1997 ) argued that the abundance patterns in damped systems are caused by depletion of heavy elements on to dust grains .",
    "this is consistent with all the observed patterns except for [ mn / fe ] and possibly [ ti / fe ] .",
    "the strongest argument in favor of this explanation was the high [ zn / fe ] ratio .",
    "but we have shown that part of this ratio probably originates from nucleosynthesis , and so a more likely explanation is that the damped abundance pattern results from small amount of dust superposed on a type ii sn abundance pattern .    as a result ,",
    "we conjecture that metal - poor damped systems evolve into metal - rich objects that become thick stellar disks at high redshifts , say @xmath0 @xmath3 3 .",
    "since the velocity dispersion of the model gaseous disks , @xmath16 @xmath3 10 , subsequent merger events are required to heat the stars to the observed velocity dispersion of the thick disk , @xmath16 @xmath3 40 . in that sense",
    "our model does not differ substantially from the scenario put forward by wyse ( these proceedings ) .",
    "for the past two years , our group ( gawiser , prochaska , cooke , & wolfe ) has been searching for lyman break galaxies in fields centered on quasars with foreground damped systems .",
    "our goals are to ( i ) find galaxies physically associated with the damped systems , and ( ii ) determine how often the damped redshifts coincide with the redshift spikes characterizing the distribution of known lyman break galaxies ( steidel 1999 ) .",
    "the correlation between damped systems and lyman break galaxies is very interesting because it tells us about the bias of the damped galaxies , and , as a result , about their mass .",
    "stated differently , if damped redshifts are preferentially located in lyman break redshift spikes , this would mean the amplitudes of density fluctuations , @xmath17 , destined to become damped galaxies are too low to collapse and form galaxies unless they are boosted by the enhanced mass density provided by the lyman break clusters .",
    "this would indicate higher - than - typical masses given the nature of the power spectrum .",
    "our survey initially focused on @xmath18 drop outs as there is no @xmath19 band photometry currently available on the keck telescopes .",
    "this restricted the sample to damped systems with @xmath0 = ( 3.8,4.5 ) .",
    "we have acquired @xmath18,@xmath20,@xmath21 images for about four damped fields in which the 1@xmath16 sensitivies correspond to to @xmath18 @xmath3 29.5 , @xmath20 @xmath3 26.5 , and @xmath21 @xmath3 26.0 . as a result",
    "we are able to detect blue drop - outs down to @xmath20 @xmath3 26.0 .",
    "we select candidate blue drop - outs using criteria established by steidel and then acquire multi - object spectra for about 20 candidates per setting using the lris multi - object spectrograph .",
    "the data have been reduced for one field containing damped systems at @xmath0 = 3.871 and 4.072 . while there are no confirmed galaxies near the high redshift systems , we have identified four galaxies within @xmath22 = 0.02 of the lower redshift system .",
    "that is , four out of a total of twelve identified galaxies lie within a steidel - like redshift spike that includes the damped redshift . if future observations show this this effect to be generic , then some fraction of damped systems may evolve into galaxies likely to be found in cluster environments , such as ellipticals .",
    "[ c ii ] 158 emission results from transitions between the p@xmath23 and p@xmath24 fine structure states in c@xmath5 .",
    "it dominates cooling by the galaxy ism with a luminosity @xmath25([c ii ] ) = 5@xmath2610@xmath27@xmath28 ( wright 1991 ) .",
    "significantly , most of the 158 emission from the ism in the galaxy and in other spiral galaxies where it is detected comes from the cold neutral medium ( cnm ) rather than the warm neutral medium , star - forming regions in spiral arms ( madden 1993 ) , or pdrs on the surfaces of molecular clouds .",
    "the last point is especially relevant for damped systems where molecules are rarely detected ( cf .",
    "lu 1999 ) .",
    "the 158 luminosities of damped systems can be estimated from @xmath29(c ii@xmath30 ) , the column density of c@xmath5 ions in the p@xmath23 state , which is inferred from the absorption profiles of the uv transition c ii@xmath30 1335.708 . the 158 luminosity per h atom is given by      where @xmath32 is the energy of the transition and @xmath33 is the coefficient for spontaneous photon emission ( lu 1999 ) . since @xmath25([c ii])=@xmath10@xmath34@xmath1@xmath12(h i)/@xmath35 , where @xmath10@xmath34@xmath1 is the density - weighted average of @xmath34 , we can estimate the c ii luminosity from damped systems provided we know the h i mass and @xmath10@xmath34@xmath1 .    in principle",
    "we can determine from the distribution of measured along individual sightlines .",
    "figure 4 shows estimates of for 11 damped systems .",
    "we also show deduced for separate sightlines through the ism and estimated for the ism .",
    "we compute for the damped sample by assuming exponential disks . in that case @xmath3 for impact parameters",
    "@xmath11 @xmath3 2@xmath7 .",
    "our monte carlo simulations show that most damped sightlines have @xmath11 @xmath10 ( 4@xmath145@xmath36@xmath7 . as a result corresponds to largest ( 2/4.5)@xmath37@xmath2611 @xmath3 2@xmath143 values of in figure 4 .",
    "we estimate log = @xmath1426.6 @xmath380.2 .",
    "while somewhat uncertain , for the damped systems is clearly more than 30 times lower than for the ism .",
    "since the [ c ii ] 158 line is the dominant coolant for the cnm , equals the heating rate for steady state conditions . as a result ,",
    "the low value of indicated for damped systems suggests low heat inputs into the protogalactic gas at high redshifts .",
    "we also use to compute the distribution of @xmath25([c ii ] ) of damped systems in various cosmogonies .",
    "mo ( 1998 ) predict the fraction of intercepted damped systems with dark - halo masses exeeding @xmath12 .",
    "we convert @xmath12 to 158 emission noting that @xmath25([c ii])=@xmath39@xmath12/@xmath40 , where @xmath39 is the fraction of dark halo mass in the disk . assuming log=@xmath1426.5 erg s@xmath41h@xmath41 , @xmath2 = 1.4 , and @xmath39=0.05 , we find @xmath25([c ii])=2@xmath2610@xmath27(@xmath42)@xmath28 .",
    "we compute the flux density at a given redshift by assuming a rectangular velocity profile with width = 2@xmath26@xmath43sin(@xmath44 ) , where sin(@xmath44 ) = 0.5 .",
    "the results for the @xmath45cdm and tf cosmogonies are shown in figure 5 . at @xmath0 @xmath3 3 the predicted alma detection rate is @xmath10 3 @xmath6 the cdm model , and about 25 @xmath6 in the tf model .",
    "thus detection of [ c ii ] 158 emission in high-@xmath0 damped systems would be highly significant .",
    "moreover , measurements of the velocity profile of the emitting gas could distinguish rotating disks from protogalactic clumps ( haehnelt 1997 ) .    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ` acknowledgments ` i wish to thank my collaborators e. gawiser and j. x. prochaska for permission to quote our joint research .",
