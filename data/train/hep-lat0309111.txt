    "numerical stochastic perturbation theory ( nspt ) methods @xcite arise within the stochastic quantization approach @xcite to quantum field theory and provide quite a general ( and rather simple ) way to perform lattice perturbation theory calculations in several contexts . in the work we are going to present in these pages ,",
    "we apply them to qcd at finite temperature , in the framework of a 3d effective theory .",
    "lattice perturbation theory calculations are needed in order to connect non - perturbative lattice results to the continuum .",
    "hence we set up our nspt simulations and compute the plaquette up to @xmath0 in the 3d pure gauge theory : we reach the infinite - volume value of each coefficient of the series by extrapolating the results we get for lattices of different sizes , and in particular we find a logarithmic divergence in the last coefficient .",
    "the topic is hot qcd , and in particular the free energy density , or the pressure of the quark - gluon plasma : it represents a good observable to study the deconfinement phase transition @xcite .",
    "the aim is to fill the gap between perturbative methods @xcite and 4d finite - temperature lattice simulations @xcite .",
    "the former have to stay in the extremely high temperature sector because of the poor convergence of the series , while the highest temperatures used in lattice simulations are about @xmath1 times the transition temperature , because of computational resource limitations .",
    "dimensional reduction is a way to access the intermediate regions .",
    "one integrates out the ` hard ' as well as the ` soft ' modes to get an effective theory for the ` ultrasoft ' modes @xcite .",
    "the result is a 3d su(3 ) pure gauge theory , whose contribution can then be estimated with lattice monte carlo techniques . to complete the matching of 3d lattice results to continuum ones @xcite",
    ", one needs lattice perturbation theory computations .",
    "according to the _ stochastic quantization _ approach , we sample the phase - space of the field theory randomly , according to a stochastic equation , the langevin equation , @xmath2}{\\partial\\phi(x , t)}+\\eta(x , t ) \\;,\\ ] ] along a new , non - physical , stochastic time @xmath3 .",
    "this sampling is such that the average over the noise @xmath4 leads to the feynman - gibbs ensemble we need for functional integration :    @xmath5\\right\\rangle_\\eta   \\mathop{-\\hspace{-.2cm}-\\hspace{-.2cm}-\\hspace{-.2cm}-\\hspace{-.2cm}\\longrightarrow}_{t\\rightarrow\\infty } \\frac{1}{z}\\hspace{-.1cm}\\int\\hspace{-.1cm}\\mathcal{d}[\\phi]\\mathcal{o}[\\phi]\\exp\\{-s[\\phi]\\ } \\;.\\ ] ]    hence , perturbation theory is performed by using the gauge - field - version of the langevin equation , @xmath6-i\\eta]u_\\eta \\;,\\ ] ] and by replacing the gauge fields @xmath7 with their perturbative expansion @xmath8 in the coupling constant @xmath9 .",
    "then we solve numerically the resulting system of equations _ via _ discretization of the stochastic time @xmath10 .      for this purpose we set up , from scratch , a c++ code ( taking a hint from the code written for ape machines in their own language ) .",
    "the flexibility of this language makes it possible to set up quite a general environment of _ classes _ and _ methods _ to handle lattice - structures ( both ` link - like ' and ` site - like ' ) .",
    "the code , moreover , is intended for pc - cluster usage , relying on mpi language for node - communications . in order to improve code - parallelization through spreading sub - lattices over the nodes ,",
    "some tricks are used , like a wide utilization of _ pointers _ and a smart allocation of physical memory especially suited to enhancing communication rates .      in practice , we evolve our system according to a discrete - stochastic - time version of the langevin equation , keeping all the orders ( in @xmath9 ) up to the one we are interested in , and we do that with different time - steps . moreover , choosing the time steps small enough to fall in the linear region allows us to extrapolate in a simple way to the continuum - stochastic - time case .",
    "all this , then , is repeated for different lattice sizes in order to take the infinite - volume limit .",
    "the preliminary results we present here are the result of @xmath11 days of running on a cluster made of 10 bi - processor athlon mp2100 pc s .",
    "we computed the weak - coupling expansion for the pure gauge plaquette @xmath12 .",
    "our expansions are written in powers of @xmath13 .",
    "the first two coefficients of this expansion are known analytically for arbitrary dimensions @xcite , so we can use them as a benchmark for our code . in particular , since for the leading coefficient also the finite - size corrections are known , we can as well check each single finite - size measurement . in fig .",
    "[ fig : g2 ] we show the @xmath14 coefficient _ versus _ the lattice - size .",
    "we tried to fit our numerical results ( the points with their error - bars in the figure ) with different forms for the finite - volume corrections , and we found that very clearly data prefer the inverse - volume correction ( the dashed line in the figure ) .",

    "in fact , for different power law fits , the infinite - volume extrapolation is quite stable and , again , in good agreement with the analytical result : @xmath20    the next coefficient , @xmath21 , is the first original result : @xmath22 in @xcite , the authors estimate this coefficient rescaling the analogous 4d value ( which is known , @xcite ) , finding @xmath23 , which is in quite reasonable agreement with the value we found .    as for the @xmath24 coefficient",
    ", we expect that the lattice reflects in the volume - dependence the logarithmic divergence one finds in continuum perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "indeed we found ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : g8 ] ) that our data - fit clearly improves if we add a logarithmic term in the interpolation law .",

    "furthermore , the coefficients of these two logarithms ( the lattice one , of the lattice - volume , and the continuum one , of the cut - off of the dimensional - reduced theory ) must be the same .",
    "hence the @xmath28 coefficient we extrapolate with our simulations can be seen as an additional ( and , it turns out , positive ) check for the reliability of our method .",
    "in fact , our estimate @xmath29 is in good agreement with the continuum result found in @xcite : @xmath30 .    as a next step",
    ", we can plug this analytical value @xmath31 into our fits in order to better estimate the constant coefficient @xmath32 , for which we then get the following result : @xmath33",
    "we use nspt methods to compute the plaquette in a 3d pure gauge su(3 ) theory , up to @xmath0 .    up to now , we are still collecting statistics in order to improve our measurements , both by increasing the number of finite stochastic - time simulations , and by filling the gaps over the range of lattice - sizes probed .",
    "furthermore , our code is now ready to simulate an additional adjoint higgs field coupled to the gauge sector , which comprises the effective theory for ` soft ' modes in the plasma .",
    "we are performing preliminary simulations for measuring both the quadratic and the quartic higgs condensates .    1 f. di renzo , g. marchesini and e. onofri , p. marenzoni , nucl .",
