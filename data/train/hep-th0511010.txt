    "there has been a continuos interest for solving the klein - gordon ( kg ) equation in the four - dimensional space - time as well as in lower dimensions for a variety of potentials @xcite-@xcite .",
    "a few recent works has been devoted to the investigation of the solutions of the kg equation by assuming that the vector potential is equal to the scalar potential chao1-@xcite whereas other works take a more general mixing @xcite-@xcite,@xcite-@xcite .",
    "although the kg equation can give relativistic corrections to the nonrelativistic quantum mechanics , in some circumstances it can present solutions not found in a nonrelativistic scheme .",
    "undoubtedly such circumstances reveal to be a powerful tool to obtain a deeper insight about the nature of the kg equation and its solutions .    the dirac equation in the background of the kink configuration of the @xmath1 model ( @xmath2 ) @xcite is of interest in quantum field theory where topological classical backgrounds are responsible for inducing a fractional fermion number on the vacuum .",
    "models of these kinds , known as kink models are obtained in quantum field theory as the continuum limit of linear polymer models @xcite-@xcite . in a recent paper",
    "the complete set of bound states of fermions in the presence of this sort of background has been addressed by considering a pseudoscalar coupling asc .",
    "a peculiar feature of the kink - like potential is the absence of bounded solutions in a nonrelativistic theory because it gives rise to an ubiquitous repulsive potential .",
    "the spectrum of this problem was found analytically due to the fact that , apart from solutions corresponding to @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , they are intrinsically relativistic solutions of the klein - gordon equation .    in the presence of vector and scalar potentials the 1 + 1 dimensional time - independent kg equation for a particle of rest mass @xmath4",
    "reads    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the energy of the particle , @xmath7 is the velocity of light and @xmath8 is the planck constant .",
    "the vector and scalar potentials are given by @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "the subscripts for the terms of potential denote their properties under a lorentz transformation : @xmath11 for the time component of the 2-vector potential and @xmath12 for the scalar term .",
    "note that @xmath13 remains invariant under the simultaneous transformations @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath16 , the case of a pure scalar potential , the negative- and positive - energy levels are disposed symmetrically about @xmath17 .",
    "it is remarkable that the kg equation with a scalar potential , or a vector potential contaminated with some scalar coupling , is not invariant under the simultaneous changes @xmath18 and @xmath19 , this is so because only the vector potential couples to the positive - energies in the same way it couples to the negative - ones , whereas the scalar potential couples to the mass of the particle .",
    "therefore , if there is any scalar coupling the the energy itself has physical significance and not just the energy difference .",
    "the kg equation can also be written as @xmath20    from this one can see that for potentials which tend to @xmath21 as @xmath22 it follows that the effective potential tends to @xmath23 , so that the kg equation furnishes a purely discrete ( continuum ) spectrum for latexmath:[$%    the potentials remains finite as @xmath22 the continuum spectrum is omnipresent but the necessary conditions for the existence of a discrete spectrum is not an easy task for general functional forms . in the nonrelativistic approximation ( potential energies small compared to @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) eq . ( [ 2 ] )",
    "becomes    @xmath27    so that @xmath13 obeys the schrdinger equation with binding energy equal to @xmath28 without distinguishing the contributions of vector and scalar potentials .",
    "it is well known that a confining potential in the nonrelativistic approach is not confining in the relativistic approach when it is considered as a lorentz vector .",
    "it is surprising that relativistic confining potentials may result in nonconfinement in the nonrelativistic approach .",
    "this last phenomenon is a consequence of the fact that vector and scalar potentials couple differently in the kg equation whereas there is no such distinction among them in the schrdinger equation .",
    "this observation permit us to conclude that even a repulsivepotential can be a confining potential .",
    "for both cases @xmath29 and @xmath30 , the kg equation reduces to schrdinger - like equations with effective potentials with the same functional dependence as @xmath10 .",
    "the case @xmath31 can present bounded solutions in the relativistic approach , although it reduces to the free - particle problem in the nonrelativistic limit .",
    "the attractive vector potential for a particle is , of course , repulsive for its corresponding antiparticle , and vice versa .",
    "however , the attractive ( repulsive ) scalar potential for particles is also attractive ( repulsive ) for antiparticles . for @xmath29 and",
    "an attractive vector potential for particles , the scalar potential is counterbalanced by the vector potential for antiparticles as long as the scalar potential is attractive and the vector potential is repulsive . as a consequence",
    "there is no bounded solution for antiparticles . for @xmath32 and a repulsive vector potential for particles , the scalar and",
    "the vector potentials are attractive for antiparticles but their effects are counterbalanced for particles .",
    "thus , recurring to this simple standpoint one can anticipate in the mind that there is no bound - state solution for particles in this last case of mixing .",
    "now let us focus our attention on scalar and vector potentials in the form @xmath33where the skew parameter , @xmath34 , and the dimensionless coupling constants , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , are real numbers .",
    "the potentials are invariant under the change @xmath37 so that the results can depend only on @xmath38 . in this case",
    "the sturm - liouville problem corresponding to eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) becomes    @xmath39    where one can recognize the effective potential as the exactly solvable rosen - morse potential @xcite-@xcite    @xmath40    @xmath41    @xmath42    the rosen - morse potential is a binding potential only if @xmath43 and @xmath44 because only in this circumstance it presents a well structure with the possible discrete effective eigenenergies into the range @xmath45whereas @xmath46 corresponds to the continuous part of the spectrum .",
    "thus , in view of the interest in the bound - state solutions it is convenient to rewrite the coupling constants in terms of the variable @xmath47 defined into the interval @xmath48 as @xmath49    in such a way that @xmath50   \\label{10}\\ ] ]    normalizable kg wave functions , corresponding to bound - state solutions , are subject to the boundary condition @xmath51 and the effective eigenenergy is given by ( see ref .",

    "( [ 11 ] ) and ( [ 14 ] ) one obtains the second - degree algebraic equation for the kg energies :    @xmath60 e^{2}+2g^{2}mc^{2}\\sin \\left ( \\frac{\\pi \\xi } { 2}\\right ) e\\qquad \\qquad \\qquad\\]]@xmath61 = 0   \\label{15}\\]]whose solutions are @xmath62    @xmath63 + \\hbar ^{2}\\gamma ^{2}\\left [ \\frac{g^{4}}{4% } \\sin ^{2}\\left ( \\pi \\xi",

    "the same happens for massless particles , independently of @xmath65 .",
    "this last symmetry is due to the fact that the effective eigenenergies of the rosen - morse potential as well as the maximum quantum number depend on the absolute value of @xmath66 and for @xmath67 this dependence transmutes into the absolute value of @xmath6 .",
    "anyhow , the energy levels corresponding to the bounded solutions are into the range @xmath68 .",
    "thus , one can see that the scalar coupling enlarges the bound - state gap and that the particle ( antiparticle ) energy levels enter from the upper ( lower ) continuum into the spectral gap .",
    "it is also clear that the capacity of the kink - like potential to hold bounded solutions increases as @xmath69 and @xmath38 increase .",
    "the kg energies are plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] , [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] as a function of @xmath65 , @xmath70 and @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "the parameters were chosen for furnishing two bounded solutions , at the most .",
    "these figures show that the energy levels are into the range @xmath71 and that , in general , both particle and antiparticle levels are members of the spectrum .",
    "they also show that neither there is crossing of levels nor the energy levels for particles ( antiparticles ) join the negative ( positive ) continuum .",
    "these facts imply that there is no channel of spontaneous particle - antiparticle creation so that the single - particle interpretation of the kg equation is ensured .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows that both particle and antiparticle levels show their face for a pure scalar coupling ( @xmath64 ) and that they are symmetrically disposed about @xmath17 .",
    "nevertheless , this symmetry is broken for @xmath72 and there can be a region where the number of particle levels is different from the antiparticle levels . furthermore , as @xmath73 the energy levels tend to disappear one after other . figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] show that there are minimum values for both @xmath69 and @xmath38 for the formation of a bound - state solution .",
    "the normalized kg wave function can be written as ( see ref . @xcite):@xmath74where @xmath75 and @xmath76 is the jacobi polynomial , a polynomial of degree @xmath58 .",
    "furthermore,@xmath77and the normalization constant is given by@xmath78    although it may seem strange , the kg wave functions are characterized just by @xmath58 so that when both particle and antiparticle levels are present in the spectrum a pair of bound - state solutions can share the same wave function .",
    "indeed , this is not a riddle because the kg equation as expressed by eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) can not be seen as an eigenvalue problem in general .",
    "however , @xmath13 is an eigenfunction of the operator @xmath79 defined in ( [ 5 ] ) with @xmath80 as the corresponding eigenvalue .",
    "therefore , a pair of kg energy levels corresponding to particle and antiparticle levels can share the same wave function if they possess the same effective eigenenergy , i.e. , the same quantum number .",
    "it is noteworthy that the width of the position probability density , @xmath81 , decreases as @xmath38 or @xmath69 increases . as such it promises that the uncertainty in the position can shrink without limit .",
    "it seems that the uncertainty principle dies away provided such a principle implies that it is impossible to localize a particle into a region of space less than half of its compton wavelength ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "this apparent contradiction can be remedied by recurring to the concept of effective compton wavelength defined as @xmath82 .",
    "hence , the minimum uncertainty consonant with the uncertainty principle is given by @xmath83 .",
    "it means that the localization of a particle under the influence of the kink - like potential does not require any minimum value in order to ensure the single - particle interpretation of the kg equation , even if the trapped particle is massless .",
    "as @xmath38 or @xmath69 increases the binding potential contributes to increase the effective mass of the particle in such a way that there is no energy available to produce particle - antiparticle pairs .",
    "the kg wave functions are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . with the chosen parameters ( @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath64 ) , a numerical calculation of the uncertainty in the position of the particle for the ground - state solution furnishes @xmath86 whereas @xmath87 .",
    "for short , the bound - state solutions of the kg equation for particles embedded in a mixed vector - scalar potential with the kink - like configuration of the @xmath88 model has been solved analytically .",
    "a half - half mixing produces no bound - state solution and in fact bounded solutions only can occur if the scalar coupling is stronger than the vector coupling .",
    "although the schrdinger equation for this sort of potential does not present any bounded solution at all , the kg equation can present a rich spectrum which might be useful for a better understanding of the localization of spinless particles in the regime of strong coupling ."
