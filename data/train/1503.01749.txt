    "in a cataclysmic variable ( cv ) a late - type main - sequence ( secondary ) star transfers mass via roche lobe overflow to a white dwarf ( primary ) , the latter being the more massive component .",
    "depending on the strength of the magnetic field of the primary , the matter is accreted either via a disc and an inner boundary layer or along the magnetic field lines directly on the magnetic pole(s ) of the white dwarf .",
    "intermediate configurations , where only the inner part of the disc is disrupted by the magnetic field , are also known . for comprehensive information on cvs",
    "see the books by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "once a certain critical mass has accumulated on the surface of the white dwarf , a thermonuclear explosion is triggered that ejects the accreted material .",
    "this phenomenon is known as a ( classical ) nova eruption and represents the principal mechanism for mass - loss in cvs .",
    "it is not yet clear whether more or less than the accreted material is ejected , i.e.  whether the white dwarfs in cvs gain or lose mass in the course of cv evolution . for recent reviews on novae",
    "see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the underlying binary system is not destroyed in the nova eruption , but instead recommences mass transfer within a couple of years @xcite .",
    "this has thus to be a recurrent event , with the minimum recurrence time currently being estimated to @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the class of ` recurrent novae ' includes novae with recurrence times @xmath1 100 yr tangetal14 - 4,darnleyetal14 - 1 .",
    "they form a small and very heterogeneous sample of objects that in many respects are very similar to cvs and in others show significant differences ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in this study we will thus concentrate on classical novae .    from the above",
    ", it follows that cvs can be regarded as novae in - between eruptions @xcite .",
    "it is still unclear to which extent the physical parameters of the cv ",
    "magnetic field , chemical composition , the mass - transfer rate @xmath2  affect the nova recurrence time , although @xmath2 surely appears as the most important one @xcite . similarly , the consequence of the nova eruption for the ( short and long - term ) evolution of cvs is not yet understood @xcite .",
    "one possibility to address these questions observationally is to compare the properties of the group of post - novae with those of other cvs .",
    "however , to be statistically significant such endeavour needs samples of sufficient size , and the group of post - novae still does not fulfil this condition .",
    "to alleviate this situation we have started a project to identify candidate post - novae via colour - colour diagrams and to confirm them spectroscopically ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i and iv , respectively ) , determine the orbital period for the brighter post - novae ( * ? ? ? * paper iii ) and to study particularly interesting systems in more detail ( * ? ? ? * paper ii ) .    in this fifth instalment of our series ,",
    "we present data on eight candidate post - novae .",
    "the targets were selected from the @xcite catalogue of cvs , where they were marked as potential classical novae . in each case , the reported nova eruption took place more than 30 yr ago , which usually represents sufficient time for the ejected material to disperse and loose its dominance on the optical spectrum , so that the latter can be used to examine the underlying cv .",
    "the previous identifications of three objects , hs sge , bs sgr and v999 sgr , were found to be ambiguous , and they were thus defined as targets for @xmath3 photometry to select likely candidates .",
    "subsequently , long - slit spectroscopy data were obtained for the selected objects to confirm or reject the nova hypothesis .",
    "another five suspected novae , v528 aql , v1301 aql , gr sgr , v1151 sgr and v3964 sgr , appeared to be sufficiently well identified to include them directly as targets for spectroscopy .    in the following ,",
    "we describe the observations and the employed techniques for data reduction ( section [ obs_sec ] ) , provide short reviews of the previously available information on the individual targets and present our results ( section [ results_sec ] and respective subsections ) , briefly discuss their implications ( section [ disc_sec ] ) , and conclude with a summary of the most important results ( section [ concl_sec ] ) .",
    "finally , finding charts for the targets are collected in an appendix .",
    "this project is still ongoing , and it is planned to further increase the sample of confirmed post - novae before discussing their properties in the context of cv evolution in a concluding paper .",

    ", we use positive values for @xmath21 .",
    "this is unambiguous since we exclusively refer to emission lines .",
    "the corresponding errors were estimated with a monte carlo simulation by adding random noise to the data and repeating the equivalent width measurement a thousand times .    in order to recover the intrinsic sed",
    ", we employ the values for interstellar extinction @xmath22 from @xcite , collected on nasa s infrared science archive ( irsa ) web pages , to deredden the spectra .",
    "we use the relations derived by @xcite as implemented in iraf , and a standard value for the ratio of the total to the selective extinction @xmath23 .",
    "the corresponding values are available as the average extinction within a 2@xmath142 deg@xmath15 field .",
    "this represents a severe limitation as it does not take into account potential small - scale variations in the dust structure , nor the actual amount of absorbing material in the line of sight to the target .",
    "since cvs are intrinsically rather faint ( typically , @xmath24 mag ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in general the correction for the interstellar extinction will represent an upper limit .",
    "an additional uncertainty regarding the intrinsic sed is introduced by obtaining the flux calibration on the basis of a single standard star that was observed on a different night than the targets .",
    "furthermore , the observations were not conducted at a parallactic angle and thus might be affected by chromatic slit loss due to differential refraction , since gemini - south is not equipped with an atmospheric dispersion corrector . as a measure for the sed , we derive the exponent @xmath25 of a power law @xmath26 that was fitted to the spectra , restricting the continuum to wavelengths 50007000  and masking strong emission and absorption lines . during that analysis we found that most of the post - novae required a two - component fit while previously this represented an exception .",
    "furthermore , in every case the two slopes differed in the same direction , with the red part of the spectrum requiring a steeper slope than the blue part , and the points that separated the two slopes were found to be within 58505900  which marks the region that is affected by the gap between two ccds ( see section [ obs_sec ] ) .",
    "all this suggests a systematic effect in the definition of the instrumental response function , and potentially a difference in the spectral efficiency of these two ccds . we have thus further divided the fitting range into a blue ( 5000  @xmath27 5870  ) and a red ( 5870  @xmath27 7000  ) part that are fitted individually .",
    "the consequences for the interpretation of the seds are further discussed in section [ disc_sec ] .",
    "finally , to estimate the spectral type of the targets that turned out not to be post - novae , as well as for a few other objects , we used the standard star libraries of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "as reported by @xcite , this fast nova was discovered on 1945 , august 26 by bertaud and then independently two nights later by tamm .",

    "the neighbour is also the slightly brighter object .",
    "comparison with the gsc 2.2 catalogue yields @xmath34 for this star , and @xmath35 mag for the post - nova .",
    "note that above errors are dominated by the uncertainty in the zero - point , while the precision for the differential photometry is @xmath170.01 mag .",
    "our comparison of the spectrum of the close neighbour with standard star libraries indicates a spectral class of late g to early k. previous photometry of v528 aql , e.g.   by @xcite , is likely to have included both components , thus yielding a larger brightness and redder colours .",
    "based on the present photometric data @xmath36 mag and the maximum brightness @xmath37 mag from @xcite we calculate the eruption amplitude @xmath38 mag .    due to the close apparent proximity , the visual binary is not resolved in our spectroscopic data .",

    "this excludes a significant contribution of the @xmath476560 line to the h@xmath25 profile .",
    "furthermore , like the other emission lines , h@xmath25 is found to be centred rather symmetrically on its rest wavelength , which makes a distortion due to other lines rather unlikely . since a comparatively short time",
    "has passed since the nova eruption , one could suspect that the line profile is due to additional emission from the ejected matter .",
    "however , on the 2d spectroscopic image we do not find any evidence for the presence of a shell . clearly , more data are needed to investigate the line profile in more detail . at the very least ,",
    "the broad and variable line profiles point to a high system inclination , which makes hs sge an attractive target for time series observations .",
    "@xcite suspect that novae with plateau - type decline light curves are either recurrent novae ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or belong to the v1500 cyg class , i.e.  contain a highly magnetized white dwarf .",
    "the large eruption amplitude @xmath48 mag and the strong presence of lets the latter scenario appear as the more likely one .",
    "however , the shape and width of especially the @xmath476678 emission line indicates the existence of at least an outer disc , so that the magnetic field of the white dwarf can be assumed to be weaker than in polars .",
    "the nova was discovered by @xcite on a plate from 1916 july 17 at a magnitude of 11.8 , reaching 10.5 mag two nights later .",
    "an independent and more comprehensive study by @xcite showed that the object rose slowly to a maximum brightness of 9.2 mag exactly one year after its discovery , followed by a slow decline with @xmath49 d @xcite .",
    "perhaps due to the scarceness of the data , bs sgr is not part of the long - term light - curve analysis of @xcite , but the observed behaviour suggests that it belongs to the small group of novae with ` flat - topped ' ( f class ) light curves .",
    "the authors find four such systems within their sample of 93 novae .",
    "the physical reason behind the prolonged plateau near maximum brightness is unknown .",

[ novasp_fig ] ) .",
    "the latter is located about 5 arcsec south - east of the object indicated in the finding chart by @xcite .",
    "it appears possible that due to the closeness of the objects , the spectrum described by @xcite is a result of the slit being centred on the object marked in @xcite , but , depending on the orientation of the slit and the seeing conditions , includes some contribution by the post - nova , thus explaining the apparent presence of the blue emission lines .",
    "subsequent studies , e.g.  by @xcite ( who remark that the colours are that of a reddened k star ) , @xcite and @xcite , can be assumed to refer to the object identified in @xcite .",
    "the colour - colour diagram , while containing several blue objects , does not immediately indicate the nova ( fig .",
    "[ ubvr_fig ] ) .",
    "the broad distribution of colours suggests that the likely reason for this is a certain patchiness of the interstellar extinction in this region .",
    "however , we found the bluest object within the central 1 arcmin of the field to be located only 5 arcsec off the reported coordinates of the nova eruption , which made it a promising target for the spectroscopic follow - up observations .",
    "the spectrum confirms the cv .",
    "it is remarkable in that it presents an unusually strong contribution from .",
    "first , the @xmath474686 line , which originates from the transition to the second excitement level , represents by far the strongest emission line in bs sgr .",
    "secondly , also all lines that originate from the transition to the third level are detected , at @xmath534542 , 4859 , 5412 and 6560  ( fig .  [ novasp_fig ] ) .",
    "the two lines that are close to the balmer lines are not resolved , but visibly distort the line profile . in fig .",
    "[ bssgrlprof_fig ] we show a close up on the two balmer  blends in the three individual spectra .",
    "we notice that from the first to the third spectrum the balmer components become stronger indicating that the region where that emission originates moves further into the line of sight .",
    "potentially present different radial velocities of the two components could further contribute to the variation of the line profiles .",
    "prominent emission usually indicates the presence of a highly magnetic white dwarf primary .",
    "we can probably exclude the possibility that bs sgr is a polar , because the absence of an accretion disc should be reflected in a large eruption amplitude ( e.g.  the best candidate for such a system , v1500 cyg , has @xmath54 mag ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and with @xmath55 mag bs sgr is clearly a nova with a rather small eruption amplitude .",
    "it is thus more likely to be an intermediate polar . on the other hand ,",
    "the emission lines are comparatively narrow ( table [ prop_tab ] ) , while at the same time the variation in the line profiles mentioned above  if due to an orbital effect",
    " suggests that the system is seen at a medium to high inclination .",
    "this makes it rather unlikely that the emission lines originate in an accretion disc .",
    "a likely alternative is that they are located on the potentially irradiated side of the secondary star .",
    "@xcite discovered the nova on a plate from 1924 april 30 at 11.4 mag .",

    "in contrast to gr sgr , the troughs are not as profound , the blue lines of the series are clearly detected , and the higher excitation lines of @xmath475412 and @xmath475812 are present .",

    "finally , the results from @xcite and @xcite raise the possibility that v999 sgr shows large variability .",
    "however , the post - nova is located in a comparatively crowded field , and the previously published finding charts left ample room for ambiguity .",
    "thus , @xcite likely observed a different object .",
    "similarly , the coordinates used by @xcite are roughly 1.6 arcsec off the actual position , and thus the post - nova is just outside their identification limit of 1 arcsec , with the large number of stars in the vicinity additionally preventing an unambiguous choice .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we estimate the respective uncertainty to @xmath170.5 mag .    however , there are a number of other factors that affect the above parameters .",
    "the brightness of the disc , and thus @xmath79 , depends on the system inclination @xcite .",
    "regarding the line strengths , @xmath21 can potentially sample more than one line , as is the case for bs sgr , and furthermore is of course only then an indicator of the optical thickness of the disc if ( most of ) the line actually originates in the disc .",
    "finally , the validity of the parameter @xmath25 that measures the slope of the sed depends strongly on the correction for interstellar extinction and the determination of the instrumental response function . summarizing the discussion in section [ results_sec ]",
    ", we point out that the extinction correction using the tabulated data does not take into account potential small - scale dust concentrations , nor the actual position of the target with respect to the dust along the line of sight . in general",
    ", the correction will represent an upper limit , and at least in the case of v999 sgr the resulting sed likely suffers from overcorrection .",
    "secondly , the instrumental response function relies on the data of a single standard star that were taken on a different night than the spectroscopy of the targets .",
    "finally , the central ccd chip and the one covering the red part of the spectrum ( redwards of 5870  ) likely have a different spectral efficiency that could not be corrected for with the available standard star data .",
    "this causes the sed in the ` red ' chip to have a somewhat steeper slope than in the central chip .",
    "therefore , while it should be feasible to discuss the values derived here for @xmath25 within the present sample , only a very rough comparison with other works will be possible .",

    "bs sgr and gr sgr that difference amounts to @xmath90 . in the case of v528",
    "aql the difference is much more pronounced .",
    "since this system is an unresolved visual binary ( section [ v528aql_sec ] ) , it is likely that the spectrum contains a certain level of contamination by the neighbour , so that it can not be described by a power law . in v999 sgr ,",
    "on the other hand , blue and red @xmath25 are identical within @xmath91 . here",
    "we find by far the largest @xmath25 , even in comparison to previous work , which lets it appear likely that this is due to overcorrection of the interstellar extinction .",
    "for such a steep slope , apparently the differences in the chip - specific sensitivities become negligible .    for a quantitative comparison",
    "we restrict ourselves to the blue @xmath25 values , mainly because in v528 aql we suspect that the red part is affected by the contribution of the close neighbour ( section [ v528aql_sec ] ) .",
    "we find that v528 aql , hs sge and gr sgr have similar values and form the middle part of the distribution , while bs sgr and v999 sgr represent the lower and upper end , respectively .",
    "the picture in bs sgr is rather unclear .",
    "the slope parameter @xmath92 suggests a comparatively low @xmath2 , which is supported by the strengths of the emission lines , although one has to take into account that there is a significant contribution of heii to the hydrogen lines . on the other hand",
    ", the small eruption amplitude indicates a bright source in the system , and this is usually interpreted as the presence of a bright accretion disc . both maximum and minimum brightness",
    "seem to be known with sufficient precision so that there is no reason to suspect a significantly larger @xmath79 .",
    "we will come back to this system below .    as has already been mentioned , the steep slope of the sed in v999 sgr points to an overcorrection of the interstellar extinction .",
    "this is supported by a comparison with gr sgr , which has otherwise very similar parameters @xmath21 , fwhm , and likely even @xmath79 , since the estimate of @xcite for @xmath77 ( see section [ grsgr_sec ] ) suggests an eruption amplitude for gr sgr of @xmath939 mag . as evidenced by the small @xmath79 and @xmath21 , with the blue balmer emission lines being in absorption troughs , gr sgr and v999 sgr are clearly still driving a very high @xmath2 , while v528 aql and hs sge are operating at a lower @xmath2 . remarkably , the former two systems are considerably ` older ' than the latter two , and with respect to the hibernation scenario @xcite one would expect the opposite @xcite .    in three of the novae , v999 sgr , hs sge and bs sgr",
    "we detect the @xmath475412 emission line , which can be taken as evidence for the presence of a magnetic white dwarf . in bs sgr additionally all other corresponding to the transition to the third excitement level",

    "in fact , the spectral characteristics are similar to systems like dq her and bt mon @xcite , the latter of which also appears to show the same type of decline light curve as bs sgr @xcite .",
    "the small fwhm indicates a comparatively low system inclination , which also agrees well with the small eruption amplitude .",
    "our discussion above has assumed that the objects recovered by us are indeed post - novae , i.e.  that they correspond to the reported nova eruptions .",
    "however , in principle they could also be other cvs that are simply close to the position of the nova .",
    "this concerns in particular the three objects hs sge , bs sgr and v999 sgr , that were selected via their colour . still , the space density of cvs is comparatively small .",
    "the highest theoretical estimates are based on models of cv birthrates and are of the order of @xmath94 @xcite , while observations still show at most a tenth of that value ( see the summary by * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , all three objects appear to belong to the high-@xmath2 cvs , which represent @xmath11% of the intrinsic cv population @xcite .",
    "it thus appears rather unlikely that such a cv would be found in the immediate ( @xmath15 arcsec ) neighbourhood of a nova eruption and not be the post - nova .",
    "a proper calculation of the respective probability would have to include a model of the galactic disc structure and take into account interstellar extinction ( that has already turned out to be problematic even for our rough analysis ) , and is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we can , however , estimate the probability to recover the original nova in our data . to this purpose",
    "we define the limiting magnitude of our photometry using the 5@xmath16 criterion , and thus as the faintest star that has been measured with a signal - to - noise ratio s / n = 5 , translating to a @xmath9 magnitude uncertainty of 0.198 mag .",
    "the resulting limits are 22.4 , 23.8 and 22.6 mag , for the photometries of hs sge , bs sgr and v999 sgr , respectively . taking the reported maximum brightness for those objects we",

    "[ amphis_fig ] we show the distribution of the eruption amplitudes @xmath79 for all novae that erupted before 1986 .",
    "this limit was chosen to ensure that the contribution of the shell to the optical brightness is negligible .",
    "we need to emphasize at this point that @xmath79 is calculated as the difference between the maximum brightness during eruption and the quiescence brightness of the post - nova .",
    "this is important since the latter can be considerably different from the brightness of the pre - nova @xcite . the data for fig .",
    "[ amphis_fig ] have been taken mainly from @xcite and @xcite .",

    ", we have identified likely candidates for the post - novae .",
    "2 .   v528 aql has the appearance of a non - magnetic cv with a comparatively medium high mass - transfer rate .",
    "the emission lines seem sufficiently strong and broad to suggest follow - up time - resolved spectroscopic data to determine the orbital period .",
    "such observations will have to take into account that the post - nova has a close visual neighbour and thus will need good seeing conditions .",
    "3 .   for hs",
    "sge , we find that the h@xmath25 emission line likely still includes some contribution from the ejected material .",
    "the spectrum furthermore contains comparatively strong heii emission , which might indicate the presence of a magnetic white dwarf . while the object is faint , the width of the emission line is such that it indicates a medium to high system inclination .",
    "this is thus an attractive target for time series photometry since the light curve is likely to show orbital features .",
    "4 .   the spectrum of bs sgr presents a large number of heii emission lines , making it a good candidate for a magnetic cv .",
    "since the small eruption amplitude indicates the presence of a comparatively bright accretion disc , it appears that bs sgr is an intermediate polar .",
    "the emission lines are narrow , but still appear to show radial velocity variations even at our low spectral resolution .",
    "this makes them unlikely to originate in a disc , and perhaps points to a location on the potentially irradiated secondary star . nevertheless , while the lines in bs sgr are narrow , they are also strong , and with a quiescent brightness of 17.9 mag time series spectroscopy should be feasible with a telescope of the 4 m class .",
    "5 .   finally , both gr sgr and v999 sgr are very obviously post - novae that still drive a very high @xmath2 .",
    "the few discernible emission lines are both weak and narrow , and thus any attempt to derive the orbital period will need high s / n , high spectral resolution data . while both objects are comparatively bright , this still might require one of the larger telescopes .",
    "it is curious that two of the ` oldest ' novae in our sample , gr sgr and v999 sgr , appear to have the highest mass - transfer rates , contrary to what one would expect from models of nova evolution .",
    "still , in a sample as small as the present , this easily can be due to individual particularities , and not necessarily reflect a general tendency .",
    "a study of a much larger sample will be necessary to properly address this point .",
