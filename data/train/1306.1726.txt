    "the discovery of the spin seebeck effect @xcite has ignited research in spin caloritronics , a field where the focus is put on the generation of spin - polarized electric currents by applying thermal gradients @xcite .",
    "nonequilibrium spin accumulations can thus be generated in response to a temperature difference across a junction even when the charge current vanishes @xcite .",
    "in addition to electronic spin , many nanostructures offer the possibility of an extra degree of freedom  the orbital quantum number .",
    "this property naturally arises in carbon nanotubes as a result of the two ways ( clockwise and anticlockwise ) that electrons possess to move around the tube axis @xcite or can be artificially realized in double quantum dot structures since each individual dot state can be viewed as the possible outcome of two - level pseudospin ( orbital ) measurements @xcite .",
    "we here put forward the idea of generating different orbital populations using temperature gradients ( orbital caloritronics ) .",
    "we thus define the orbital or pseudospin seebeck coefficient which measures the orbital bias voltage generated across a mesoscopic conductor under the conditions of vanishing charge and orbital currents . remarkably , we find that the orbital thermopower acts as an efficient probe to characterize pseudospin - driven quantum transitions in quantum dots and carbon nanotubes .",
    "the orbital degree of freedom plays an essential role in the formation of highly symmetric kondo states . while the conventional su(2 ) kondo resonance arises , at low temperature @xmath0 , from the many - body exchange interaction between a localized spin @xmath1 ( the quantum impurity ) and conduction band electrons ( the fermi sea ) , the su(4 ) kondo physics occurs because the entangled spin and orbital degrees of freedom form a hyperspin with higher dimensionality that undergoes simultaneous flip processes both in the spin and the orbital sectors @xcite .",
    "hence , the transition between su(2 ) and su(4 ) kondo effects involves two strongly correlated states with rather different temperature scales ( the kondo temperatures @xmath2 and @xmath3 that typicially fulfill @xmath4 ) .",
    "such transition has been investigated both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite .",
    "in particular , an applied magnetic field in nanotubes couples differently to the spin and orbital quantum numbers @xcite , lifting the degeneracy and allowing for a tunable conversion from su(4 ) kondo physics to a purely spin or orbital kondo effect @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "pseudospin resolved transport has been achieved very recently in double quantum dots @xcite .",
    "thermoelectric properties of su(2 ) kondo impurities show not only clear changes depending on the ratio @xmath5 @xcite but also deviations from the semiclassical mott formula @xcite .",
    "these are important features for strongly interacting quantum dots that might potentially work as nanoscale thermoelectric coolers or heat - to - electricity converters .",
    "when the pseudospin degree of freedom is created by charged states in negative charging energy quantum dots , the seebeck coefficient can be substantially enlarged @xcite . moreover",
    ", pure spin currents can be thermally generated from an artificial kondo impurity coupled to ferromagnetic leads @xcite or in the presence of magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "recently , the seebeck coefficient has been proposed as a sensitive probe of the transition between su(2 ) and su(4 ) kondo states @xcite .",
    "it is thus natural to ask whether the generalization to orbital thermopower can provide additional insight on that transition .",
    "below , we demonstrate that the orbital seebeck coefficient shows a characteristic minimum that signals the crossover from one kondo state to another",
    ". therefore , investigation of orbital thermoelectric effects is interesting from both viewpoints  the practical motivation that leads to the generation of orbital polarizations and the fundamental study of orbital driven phase transitions and crossovers .",
    "we consider a generic mesoscopic conductor with interacting electrons and coupled to left ( @xmath6 ) and right ( @xmath7 ) leads .",
    "let @xmath8 be the orbital index that labels the two orbital states present both in the sample and in the leads . for completeness",

    "it is worthy to note that the electrochemical potential @xmath23 depends on the orbital index @xmath10 that labels the bias @xmath24 .",
    "this model is valid for , e.g. , a long carbon nanotube with a depleted region acting as a quasi - localized level ( the quantum dot ) .",
    "it has been experimentally confirmed that the orbital index is conserved during tunneling across a highly symmetric carbon - nanotube quantum dot @xcite .",
    "thus , possible orbital polarizations are determined from the imbalance @xmath25 @xcite . finally , @xmath26 is the temperature shift applied to lead @xmath27 .",
    "we define the _ orbital _ current as @xmath28 while the electric ( charge ) current is accordingly given by @xmath29 .",

    "@xcite proposes analogous expressions for the pure spin case .",

    "n = _ d ^n ( -_f_0 ( ) ) _ ( ) , with @xmath43 the equilibrium distribution function ( we set @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) .    to have purely orbital currents , the charge current must vanish .",
    "this is accomplished by the application of the electric bias ev = -(+ ) .",
    "[ eq : appvo ] therefore , the orbital seebeck coefficient becomes s_o = ( - ) .",
    "[ eq : sorb ] this is a general result .",
    "we expect the formation of an orbital bias @xmath46 in the leads when the transmission depends on the orbital index , similarly to the temperature driven generation of spin biases in junctions showing spin - dependent scattering @xcite .    at low temperatures ,",
    "it is useful to consider the sommerfeld expansion @xcite . then , s_o ( - ) , [ eq : sorb0 ] to leading order in @xmath0 .",
    "this expression is a generalization of the mott formula @xcite valid for orbital bias driven quantum systems .    for comparison",
    ", we also give the expression of the charge seebeck coefficient : s_c = ( + ) , [ eq : scharge ] which in the limit of @xmath47 becomes s_c ( + ) .",
    "[ eq : scharge0 ]    equations and are valid for generic nanostructures with two orbital states . as an illustration",
    ", we now consider a quantum dot with energy levels _ = _",
    "d+ , where @xmath48 is the orbital splitting induced by any symmetry breaking mechanism such as a magnetic field along a nanotube axis @xcite and @xmath49 is the mean energy level measured with respect to @xmath21 . formally , the problem is equivalent to a spin - split quantum dot with a single energy level .",
    "however , the difference is that spin and orbital states couple differently to an external magnetic field since their associated magnetic moments generally differ ; e.g. , for a carbon - nanotube quantum dot , orbital splittings of the order of @xmath48 are 1020 times larger than spin splittings at a fixed magnetic field @xcite",
    ". we shall first consider noninteracting electrons and then discuss in detail the strongly correlated case where the orbital degree of freedom plays a crucial role .",
    "for noninteracting electrons , the exact expression for the dot spectral weight is a _ ( ) = . using this equation in eqs .   and",

    "[ fig : nisc ] .",
    "we observe in fig .",
    "[ fig : nisc ] ( b ) that when @xmath50 the charge thermopower @xmath51 changes sign when the dot level @xmath52 lies above or below @xmath21 .",
    "this is an expected behaviour due to the ability of @xmath51 to indicate electron- or hole - like transport @xcite .",
    "as @xmath48 increases , @xmath51 remains roughly constant until the split level crosses @xmath21 and @xmath51 then changes sign .",
    "importantly , the charge thermopower vanishes at the particle symmetry point ( @xmath53 ) regardless of the @xmath48 value .",
    "more interestingly , the orbital thermopower @xmath54 shows distinct features , see fig .",
    "[ fig : nisc](a ) .",
    "it vanishes in both limits , @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "this is expected since no orbital bias can be induced if the two orbitals are degenerate or they lie far apart .",
    "furthermore , the orbital thermopower is quite generally nonzero when particle - hole symmetry takes place at @xmath53 , unlike @xmath51 .",
    "the two seebeck coefficients also differ when transport is electron- or hole - like . while @xmath51 changes its sign when @xmath52 is reversed with respect to @xmath21 , the orbital seebeck coefficient is insensitive to whether transport is dominated by electron or hole excitations since both curves for @xmath57 and @xmath58 in fig .",
    "[ fig : nisc](a ) are identical [ @xmath59 in eq .  ] .",
    "in addition , for @xmath60 @xmath61 reaches an optimal value when the spliting @xmath48 is of the order of @xmath62 because charge fluctuations are maximal precisely at that level position .",
    "the optimal value shifts with @xmath63 and new peaks arise due to the passage of the split level @xmath64 across @xmath65 above and below the fermi energy .",
    "this demonstrates a full tunability of the generated orbital population with the aid of an external gate voltage .",
    "consider now electron - electron interactions described by @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the occupation of the dot spin - orbital state @xmath68 and @xmath69 is the onsite charging energy .",

    "one possibility is to employ a slave - boson mean - field theory @xcite .",

    "this is qualitatively correct in the limit @xmath55 but it breaks down as @xmath48 increases because @xmath80 will be renormalized differently for @xmath81 , similarly to the spin kondo effect in the presence of ferromagnetism @xcite . since our main goal in the remainder of the paper is to discuss a qualitative picture of the orbital themoelectric effect in a strongly correlated system , we prefer not to delve into complicated details and consider instead the _ scaled _ thermopowers [ eq : sosc2 ] @xmath82    next , we follow two different routes for assessing @xmath83 .",

    "<S> we discuss out - of - equilibrium population imbalances between different orbital states due to applied thermal gradients . </S>",
    "<S> this purely thermoelectric orbital effect appears quite generically in nanostructures with a pseudospin degree of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> we establish an orbital seebeck coefficient that characterizes the induced orbital bias in response to a temperature difference between reservoirs coupled to a quantum conductor . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze a two - terminal strongly interacting quantum dot with two orbital states and find that the orbital thermopower acts as an excellent tool to describe the transition between su(4 ) and su(2 ) kondo physics . </S>",
    "<S> our conclusions are reinforced from a detailed comparison with the charge thermopower using numerical renormalization group calculations . </S>"
