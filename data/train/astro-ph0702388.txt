    "binaries containing compact components are of great current interest in astrophysics . for an up - to - date online review of the origin and evolution of binaries with all types of compact components",
    "see @xcite .",
    "more specifically , for recent discussions of the orbital evolution and stability of mass transfer in the case of double white dwarf binaries , see @xcite and @xcite ( gpf ) .",
    "white dwarf stellar remnants represent the most frequent endpoint for stellar evolution and are therefore the most common constituents of binaries with compact components .",
    "when common envelope evolution occurs , a white dwarf pair can emerge as a sufficiently compact binary for gravitational radiation to drive the binary to a semi - detached state over an astrophysically interesting timescale .",
    "it has been estimated that @xmath4 double white dwarf ( dwd ) binaries exist within the galaxy , of which approximately 1/3 are semi - detached @xcite .",
    "the richness of these binaries will in fact impose a confusion - limited background for low - frequency gravitational wave detectors such as lisa @xcite . in this paper , we focus on the behavior of such double white dwarf binaries from the point where mass transfer ensues by evolving an equilibrium , semi - detached polytropic binary hydrodynamically .",
    "we leave the complex and interesting phenomena that bring such binaries into contact for other studies .    for a cool white dwarf star with mass well below the chandrasekhar mass ,",
    "gravity is balanced by the degeneracy pressure of non - relativistic electrons . for this study",
    ", we use a polytropic equation of state as an approximation to an idealized , cool white dwarf . for a polytrope with index @xmath5 and corresponding adiabatic exponent @xmath6 , the radius  mass relation is @xmath7",
    "if both components of a dwd binary have equal entropy ( equal polytropic constants in the view of this approximate equation of state ) , it must be the less massive star that will reach contact with its roche lobe first .",
    "furthermore , equation ( [ mr ] ) indicates that the donor will expand upon mass loss to the accretor .",
    "this fact introduces the possibility that the resulting mass transfer may be dynamically unstable as the donor can expand well beyond its roche lobe leading to catastrophic mass transfer .",
    "if we neglect the angular momentum in the spin of the binary components and allow all the angular momentum contained in the mass transfer stream to be returned to the orbit by tides , we would expect that a binary composed of stars obeying the mass - radius relation in equation ( [ mr ] ) is stable provided that @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are , respectively , the masses of the donor and accretor .",
    "however , it is now well known that the exchange of angular momentum in dwd binaries dramatically alters their stability properties ( marsh _ et al . _  2004",
    "in many instances , the accretion stream will directly strike the surface of the accretor instead of orbiting to eventually form an accretion disk . as is well - known",
    ", a tidally truncated accretion disk can efficiently return the advected angular momentum to the orbit .",
    "however , in the direct impact accretion mode the stream spins up the accretor and it is not clear how much angular momentum can be returned to the orbit .",
    "we note that direct impact accretion is of relevance in cases where the binary components are of comparable size .",
    "in addition to dwd binaries , similar circumstances arise in the evolution of algol binaries as well , for example .",
    "the importance of the fundamental uncertainty in the efficiency of tidal coupling was highlighted in the population synthesis calculations of @xcite . in the idealized case where no angular momentum is lost in the accretor s spin",
    "( as would hold for the prediction in equation [ qdisk ] ) , approximately @xmath11 of dwd binaries can survive mass transfer to become long - lived , am cvn - type binaries . on the other hand , if none of the accretor s spin angular momentum is returned to the orbit , the effective mass ratio for stable mass transfer is reduced significantly from the expectation reflected in equation ( [ qdisk ] ) and very few am cvn can arise from a dwd progenitor .",
    "rather , most dwd binaries would be disrupted shortly after becoming semi - detached , followed by a disk or common envelope phase and ending in merger . in the event that the total system mass exceeds the chandrasekhar limit",
    ", the catastrophic merger would result in a , perhaps anomalous , type ia supernova .",
    "we present here a series of evolutions of an initially semi - detached dwd binary model with an initial mass ratio of @xmath0 .",
    "the accretor is sufficiently large for the resulting mass transfer stream to strike the accretor directly .",
    "this binary thus begins its evolution as a stable system with respect to mass transfer in the limiting case of efficient tidal coupling but will be unstable if direct impact accretion removes angular momentum from the binary orbit . in  2 , we present our baseline evolution of this model through 43 orbits and demonstrate that while mass transfer does grow rapidly in the initial phase , the binary separates and the mass transfer rate then declines allowing the binary to survive . to further investigate this result , we measure the mass ratio for stability to dynamical mass transfer in  3 by repeating our initial simulation with various artificial driving rates of angular momentum loss .",
    "we find that , effectively , this model binary transitions from unstable mass - transfer to stable mass transfer ; at late times it appears to behave like a system that returns angular momentum rapidly to the binary orbit despite the absence of a tidally truncated accretion disk . in  4 , we present a simple analysis for understanding these evolutions in terms of orbit - averaged equations .",
    "this analysis demonstrates that , in our simulations , the rate of change in the spin of the accretor saturates and subsequently the mass transfer rate begins to subside . in the concluding",
    " 5 , we summarize our results and highlight some important points that may limit the application of our results to real dwd binaries .",
    "we begin by considering the numerical evolution of a polytropic binary with an initial mass ratio of @xmath0 .",
    "the computational tools for performing this simulation and for generating the initial data have been described previously in @xcite ( mtf ) and include the important modifications described in @xcite ( dmtf ) that enable long - term evolutions of binary models . in the evolution",
    ", we solve the equations for ideal , newtonian hydrodynamics while simultaneously solving poisson s equation to give a consistent gravitational potential at every timestep in the evolution .    the initial data describe an @xmath5 polytropic binary that is synchronously rotating on a circular orbit .",
    "the relevant parameters for the @xmath0 ( hereafter q0.4 ) model are listed in table 1 . as in dmtf , we use polytropic units where the radial extent of the computational grid for the scf model , the maximum density of one binary component and the gravitational constant are all unity . in table 1",
    ", we list initial values for the mass ratio @xmath12 , separation @xmath13 , angular frequency @xmath14 , total angular momentum @xmath15 and the offset @xmath16 between the system center of mass and the origin of the evolution grid ( which is much less than the grid spacing used @xmath17 ) . we also have tabulated values for the component s mass @xmath18 , maximum density @xmath19 , polytropic constant @xmath20 , stellar volume @xmath21 and roche lobe volume @xmath22 .",
    "note in particular that the polytropic constants , @xmath20 , are not equal for the two components and that the volume of the more massive star , ultimately the accretor , exceeds the volume of the donor which is nearly in contact with its roche lobe . in the formulation of the scf code",
    "we have used to create this initial data ( see mtf for details ) , we must specify parameters that do not directly correspond to a desired binary with a prescribed mass or entropy ratio .",
    "the q0.4 model was generated by trial and error and while it posses an interesting mass ratio , its components do not conform to the desired mass - radius relation of equation ( [ mr ] ) relative to one another due to the difference in polytropic constants .",
    "we have begun to develop an improved scf technique that is capable of enforcing a desired mass ratio and mass - radius relation _ a priori _ but for now we proceed with the q0.4 model as it stands . though the accretor is well inside its roche lobe initially , and becomes even more confined in its potential well as the evolution proceeds , the reader is encouraged to be mindful of the caveat that the accretor s size may accentuate gravitational torques on the binary leading the system to be more stable to dynamical mass transfer than real dwd binaries of the same initial mass ratio .    to make this cautionary note concrete , from table 1 one can conclude that the effective radius of the accretor is approximately 1.6 times larger than it should be based upon the mass radius relation in eq .",
    "( 1 ) due to the differing polytropic constants of the two components .",
    "the magnitude of the tidal field of the accretor should scale as @xmath23 ( see for example @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "the accretor s tidal field in this specific binary model is thus overestimated by a factor of approximately 17 .",
    ".initial parameters for model q0.4 [ cols=\"<,^,<,^,^ \" , ]     for this model binary , with an initial mass ratio intermediate between the plausible maximum and minimum values of @xmath2 , we find that it behaves , in the steady phase of the evolution , in a manner more consistent with that case of maximum efficiency for tidal coupling . the advected angular momentum that spins up the accretor",
    "is returned to the binary orbit on a timescale comparable to the mass transfer timescale itself .",
    "we therefore conclude that in many instances , dwd binaries could survive to reach a long - lived am cvn state if hydrodynamics and gravity were the only processes in play . to understand this curious result in more detail",
    ", we turn in the next section to analyze the simulation output from the point of view of a relatively simple , orbit - averaged equation of motion for the binary .",
    "in the previous sections , we have demonstrated the surprising resiliency of a polytropic binary that undergoes direct impact accretion .",
    "we have found that , in terms of dynamics , the binary behaves as if there were a mechanism in the system that can effectively return angular momentum from the accretor s spin to the binary orbit .",
    "we have also observed in the three simulations of this binary where the donor star survives , that the accretor does not spin up indefinitely . to the contrary",
    ", the spin angular momentum of the accretor appears to saturate despite the fact that mass transfer continues to bring high - angular momentum material onto the accretor .    to understand this behavior , we turn to a simplified orbit - averaged equation to analyze the different physical effects that are competing to determine the fate of the binary . for general background on orbit - averaged equations and their application to the orbital evolution of dwd see gpf .",
    "we first decompose the angular momentum of the binary into the orbital angular momentum of each star s center of mass and the spin angular momentum of each star about their respective center of mass as follows @xmath24 for a point mass binary , we may use kepler s third law to express the orbital angular momentum as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the orbital separation and @xmath27 is the universal gravitational constant . combining equations ( [ j ] ) and ( [ k3 ] ) and then logarithmically differentiating with respect to time we obtain @xmath28 where we have assumed conservative mass transfer .",
    "the left hand side in equation ( [ oae ] ) reflects the trajectory of the mean orbit and this is equated to several competing terms on the right hand side . since @xmath29 is negative , the driving term tends to shrink the binary while the exchange of mass tries to expand the system since the mass ratio is less than unity . recall that @xmath30 is by its nature a negative quantity . on the other hand ,",
    "an increase in the spin angular momentum of either the donor or accretor drives @xmath31 to negative values as the angular momentum had to ultimately come at the expense of the binary orbit .",
    "we apply equation ( [ oae ] ) by simply substituting the simulation data ( as appears in the plots of figure [ ensem_plots ] ) for all the terms .",
    "time derivatives are evaluated through numerical differentiation and the natural scale of the terms is the initial binary frequency , @xmath32 .",
    "for example , the term on the left hand side is proportional to the rate at which the binary separation changes as a percentage rate per orbital period , @xmath33 .",
    "the data values and their time derivatives have been smoothed with a sliding boxcar average with a width of three @xmath33 , as was used previously to construct the mass transfer rates in figures [ q04a_plots ] and [ ensem_plots ] .",
    "the terms appearing in equation ( [ oae ] ) are plotted as a function of time for the four simulations in figure [ oae_plots ] ; each row in the figure represents a separate simulation where q0.4a is across the top and q0.4d is across the bottom .",
    "the black curves in both the left - hand panels and the right - hand panels of figure [ oae_plots ] display the behavior of the left - hand side of equation ( [ oae ] ) , while the total sum of the terms on the right - hand side of that equation is shown in red on the right - hand panels of the figure .",
    "the two sides of the equation do indeed track each other , with the orbit oscillating ( due to epicyclic motion ) about the mean dictated by the right hand side .",
    "the behaviors of the individual terms that contribute to the right - hand side of equation ( [ oae ] ) are displayed in the middle column of figure [ oae_plots ] .",
    "the driving loss of angular momentum appears in orange and is given by a superposition of step functions .",
    "the initial driving to force the binary into contact appears in all four simulations at a @xmath34 rate of loss for the initial 1.6 orbits . at 7.7 orbits ,",
    "the additional driving terms are switched on at the rates given in table 2 for simulations q0.4b - q0.4d .",
    "the mass transfer term , that is , the last term appearing on the right hand side of equation ( [ oae ] ) , is plotted ( including the sign ) as the green curves in figure [ oae_plots ] .",
    "this term is indeed stabilizing and tries to force the binary separation to expand .",
    "the spin terms are shown in blue with the donor s spin ( again , including the sign ) plotted as dashed blue lines near zero amplitude and the accretor s spin contribution plotted as solid blue curves .",
    "cccc + simulation & @xmath35 & time of minimum @xmath36 & time of maximum @xmath37 + q0.4a & 0.0 & 7.94 @xmath33 & 10.12 @xmath33 + q0.4b & @xmath38 & 14.29 @xmath33 & 17.34 @xmath33 + q0.4c & @xmath39 & 17.37 @xmath33 & 19.56 @xmath33 +    the simulated binaries satisfy equation ( [ oae ] ) to a surprising accuracy .",
    "the black curves closely track the effective driving within the binary - the sum of all terms on the right hand side plotted in red - even for the extreme mass transfer of the q0.4d simulation .",
    "for this run , the mass transfer and accretor spin terms each diverge in opposite directions and yet the binary separation tracks their combined effect closely . in the remaining three simulations , the binary separation oscillates about the effective driving as eccentricity builds up in the orbit .",
    "we also observe that while the spin - up of the accretor tries to destabilize the binary , this term makes its largest contribution to the balance of equation ( [ oae ] ) relatively early in each evolution and then begins to decrease to zero . the accretor s spin term rising to zero means that the spin angular momentum of the accretor is approaching a constant value .",
    "shortly after the accretor spin term starts to diminish , the mass transfer term also begins to decrease in all three simulations where the donor star survives . for reference ,",
    "we have recorded the time of the largest magnitude contribution from the accretor s spin term and mass transfer term in table 3 . in all three cases where the donor survives",
    ", the accretor spin up begins to decrease and 2 - 3 orbits later , the mass transfer rate begins to decline as well .",
    "clearly we would like to understand the mechanism whereby the binary averts its demise .",
    "unfortunately we are not able at this point to offer an unambiguous interpretation . in an attempt to elucidate the observed behavior",
    ", we display in fig .",
    "[ omega_plots ] the evolution of the principal moment of inertia @xmath40 of the accretor , the mean spin angular velocity of the accretor @xmath41 , the angular velocity of the binary @xmath42^{1/2}$ ] , and the ratio of the latter two .",
    "the angular velocities are referred to the inertial frame and plotted normalized to @xmath14 . in a recent preprint , @xcite ( hereafter rpa )",
    "discussed the possibility that a resonance condition between the orbital frequency and the eigenfrequencies of some of the generalized @xmath43-modes in the accretor star , saturates its spin and channels rotational kinetic energy into oscillation modes .",
    "this translates into a dissipationless torque capable of returning the spin angular momentum back to the orbit and thus increases the efficiency of tidal coupling .",
    "the fact that in our nonlinear simulations the change in the spin of the accretor is coupled to the dynamics of the binary , and that we observe equatorial distortions with @xmath44 ( see the movies accompanying fig .",
    "3 ) , seem at first sight to suggest that these modes play a role .",
    "however , when examined in detail , there are some aspects of the evolution that are inconsistent with the above interpretation .    during the evolutions q0.4a , b and c , the net torque on the accretor attains its largest positive ( spin - up ) value approximately at @xmath45 , 14 and 17 , respectively ( see table 3 ) and the accretion rate peaks a few orbital periods later .",
    "thus we know that the accretion torque is decreasing in magnitude , while the tidal torques trying to spin down the accretor are present and eventually the net torque changes sign at times @xmath46 .",
    "this indicates that the spin angular momentum is being returned to the orbit , the separation increases and the mass transfer rate continues to decline thereafter . in simulation q0.4d , on the other hand , the driving is strong enough to keep the net torque positive throughout and the accretion rate increases monotonically until the donor is disrupted .",
    "a further interesting feature of the simulations is the appearance of distortions suggestive of modes with @xmath47 at or after the spin - up torque peaks and before the time in which the spin saturates , while the orbital frequency continues to decline . as has been indicated by the asterisks marking the curves in the bottom panel of fig .  6",
    ", we observe in simulations q0.4d and q0.4c , and less clearly in q0.4b , that equatorial distortions with @xmath48 appear first , and then evolve through decreasing @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "it is not clear whether even higher @xmath51 modes arise earlier on , nor if lower @xmath51 modes appear at the end . in every case",
    "these distortions arise during spin up and fade as the accretor spin levels off .",
    "furthermore , the appearance of the azimuthal waves coincides roughly with the time in which the ratio @xmath52 ( even for run q0.4d which fails to regain stability ) passes through the range in which the resonance conditions for some , but not all of the modes are met .",
    "while the above features of our evolutions seem to suggest that the @xmath43-modes described by rpa are involved at some level , there are several reasons that limit the direct applicability of the results of rpa to our simulations : i ) their calculated mode frequencies and estimated spin saturation frequencies are valid for an accretor in solid body rotation while the accretor in our simulations is differentially rotating and develops a prominent  accretion belt \" ; ii ) the extremely high accretion rate and stream impact in our simulations are significant deviations from the conditions assumed in rpa ; iii ) our simulations place no restrictions on the number , amplitude , or character of modes present , whereas rpa only consider generalized @xmath43-modes in the linear regime . in regard to this last point , although we have no direct measure of the effective polar quantum number @xmath53 dominant in the simulations , the thickness of the accretion belt does not appear to change much . finally , while runs q0.4a and b seem to saturate approximately at values @xmath54 ( see bottom frame of fig .",
    "[ omega_plots ] ) consistent with the values predicted by rpa ( 1.54 for the incompressible case , and 1.406 for a polytrope of index @xmath55 , for a mode with @xmath56 and @xmath50 ) , run q0.4c levels off at a higher spin .",
    "note that at late times , the accretion torque is significantly reduced as the accretion rate decreases , and that the leveling off of the spin is to be expected as the binary separates . in the scenario studied by rpa , the saturation frequency for the spin of the accretor is a direct indication of the ( single ) generalized r - mode excited by the tidal gravitational field .",
    "in contrast , our simulations a through c all show different values for the plateau in the accretor s spin frequency in fig . 6 and",
    "these spin values scale with increasing mass transfer rate .",
    "the diagnostic analysis that will be required to fully disentangle stream impact , tidal , and accretion effects unambiguously is beyond the scope of this paper . a more detailed analysis of these interactions in the present simulations as well as in other mass transfer evolutions that we have performed is underway and will be reported elsewhere .",
    "of the accretor around the spin axis normalized to its initial value , the mean spin angular velocity of the accretor @xmath57 , the keplerian estimate of the angular frequency of the binary @xmath58 , and the ratio @xmath52 as functions of time .",
    "the angular velocities are referred to the inertial frame and are plotted normalized to the initial binary or corotating frame frequency .",
    "the color coding for the curves is the same as in fig .",
    "the bottom frame also shows the two values corresponding to the resonant frequency ratios for the generalized @xmath43-mode with @xmath56 and @xmath50 for an incompressible spheroid and a polytrope of index @xmath55 as deduced from rpa .",
    "the asterisks on the curves indicate the approximate times during which accretion belt disturbances resembling modes with ( from left to right ) @xmath48 , 5 , 4 and 3 are present ( see the movies accompanying fig .",
    "only @xmath48 is clearly discernible in run q0.4b . ]    to summarize , the picture that we have unveiled through these simulations is as follows . upon reaching contact ,",
    "the binary is - at least initially - dynamically unstable to mass transfer .",
    "this can be expressed with the inequality that @xmath59 .",
    "the mass transfer rate grows rapidly but the binary then finds a means of escape . the consequential angular momentum loss from the orbit becomes ineffective and angular momentum",
    "is returned to the orbit at nearly the same rate that it is advected through the accretion stream .",
    "the binary must react as if @xmath60 and now @xmath61 .",
    "the binary separation expands even faster , the mass transfer rate drops and the dynamical instability is averted .",
    "we have simulated , hydrodynamically , direct impact accretion in an initially semi - detached , polytropic binary .",
    "this model possesses an interesting mass ratio that is intermediate between the two plausible stability bounds of @xmath60 for very efficient tidal coupling and @xmath62 that applies when none of the advected angular momentum makes its way back to the orbit . from our baseline evolution",
    "we have demonstrated that for this model , @xmath63 as the mass transfer rate begins to decline once the binary has crossed this mass ratio .",
    "this lower bound for @xmath2 is refined further by evolving the model to its equilibrium mass transfer rate corresponding to an imposed driving loss of angular momentum . from this numerical experiment",
    ", we find that @xmath64 , consistent with the expectation for efficient tidal coupling in the binary .",
    "this also indicates that the stability boundary itself changes through the evolution . by examining the simulations in light of the individual terms in the orbit - averaged equation for the binary separation ( equation [ oae ] )",
    ", we see that the contribution from the spin - up of the accretor reaches an extreme value and then begins to decline in importance .",
    "after the spin of the accretor begins to stabilize , the mass transfer rate begins to decline .",
    "we therefore conclude that during the evolution , @xmath2 transitions from the tidally - inefficient to tidally efficient limits on a timescale comparable to the mass - transfer time itself .",
    "although we observe that spin angular momentum is returned to the orbit by tidal coupling to disturbances in the accretion belt , the detailed mechanism by which this is achieved requires further investigation .",
    "the behavior of the q0.4 model supports the previous simulations we have performed for a dwd binary with an initial mass ratio of @xmath65 ( dmtf ) . in that work",
    ", we found that the binary expanded and appeared likely to survive intact .",
    "however , we were not able to evolve the binary long enough to observe the mass transfer rate declining , though its growth became progressively slower throughout that evolution .",
    "we also note that for the dwd binary presented in dmtf , the initial binary components followed the expected mass - radius relation for @xmath5 polytropes . at this point , it is important to note that we have examined only two binaries in detail to date and caution is warranted before generalizing our results .",
    "this note of caution is especially important for the results presented here for the q0.4 model .",
    "as discussed previously , the accretor is too large compared to the donor star to represent a realistic dwd system and it is plausible that the relative size of the accretor may have exaggerated the efficiency of torques within the binary . to address this concern",
    ", we are developing a more flexible scf code to generate initial data that conform to prescribed ratios for the mass and entropies of the two components .",
    "future simulations , for dwd models with a range of initial mass ratios , will allow us to conclusively map out the effective stability boundaries that hold for binaries undergoing direct impact accretion .",
    "the effective stability bounds that have been discussed here considered only the hydrodynamic flow of material in the self - consistent gravitational potential of the system . in reality",
    ", we expect that dwd binaries that begin dynamically unstable mass transfer - and even some systems where the mass transfer remains stable ( @xcite ; gpf ) - accrete at a rate in excess of the eddington rate .",
    "realistically , we can not neglect the influence of radiation on the dynamics of the accreted material .",
    "it is widely expected , though not conclusively demonstrated , that super - eddington mass transfer will fill a common envelope about the dwd causing the components to inspiral and merge .    to put this statement in a concrete context , in our simulations of the q0.4 model",
    ", the lowest mass transfer rate we can accurately resolve far exceeds the eddington rate for a white dwarf accretor by 4 - 5 orders of magnitude . to be consistent",
    ", we should really be examining accretion in dwd binaries as a radiative hydrodynamics process .",
    "while this goal lies well beyond the scope of the current work , we feel that such simulations may uncover yet more unexpected behavior .",
    "for example , the accretion flow from the donor will carry angular momentum that ensures that , at least in the initial phases of the mass transfer , the accreted material will be far from a spherically symmetric state .",
    "radiation from the accretion shock may have a clear channel to escape the system and a common envelope may not even form if the binary can rapidly transition from dynamically unstable to stable mass transfer .",
