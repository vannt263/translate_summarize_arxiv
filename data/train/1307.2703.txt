    "since its first phenomenological observation more than thirty years ago @xcite , the physics of the quantum hall effects has spurred a wealth of groundbreaking theoretical achievements , which have eventually clarified the generality of the topological aspects at the heart of this fascinating problem @xcite .",
    "it is now understood that the dynamical properties of the two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron motion under the simultaneous presence of electric and magnetic fields are determined by a topological invariant of the bloch bands , an integer known as the chern number @xcite , which is different from zero only after time - reversal symmetry ( trs ) is broken by the external magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of motion . as a consequence , the semiclassical equations of motion for the electron group velocity depend on a topological term related to the non - vanishing berry curvature @xcite .",
    "the relevance of such topological theories is twofold .",
    "on one hand , the generality of geometrical properties has been extensively used to explain a number of physical phenomena in condensed matter , from the anomalous hall effect @xcite to the existence of topological superconductors and insulators @xcite . on the other , since the topological invariant is a global property of the energy eigenstates of the system , it is intrinsically robust against system perturbations , such as lattice distortions and disorder . as a typical example , in a quantum hall system the transverse conductance is a multiple of the chern invariant of the gauge bundle @xcite , for which its value is extremely stable against structural characteristics of the system , and it is measured with accuracies of one part on hundred million @xcite . as a further consequence ,",
    "topologically non - trivial systems possess chiral ballistic edge states at the border of a finite sample @xcite .",
    "such states , induced by the spatial boundary between systems with distinct topological phases , allow uni - directional and nonreciprocal electronic transport @xcite , and they are intrinsically immune to back - scattering .    the analogies between photonic band dispersion in artificially periodic electromagnetic systems , known as photonic crystals @xcite , and",
    "the electron band theory in crystalline solids have recently motivated the idea that trs breaking allows non - trivial topological properties of the photonic modes in such systems @xcite .",
    "typically , faraday - active elements arranged in a periodic lattice produce the required breaking of symmetry , necessary to induce a non - vanishing chern number for photonic bands @xcite . following these early proposals ,",
    "propagation of back - scattering immune photonic edge states has been observed at the interface between a magneto - optical photonic crystal and a topologically trivial photonic medium @xcite .",
    "clearly , these features could be very important for future applications in integrated photonic circuits , because of the possibility to exploit uni - directional channels of electromagnetic energy transport that are intrinsically insensitive to disorder in the sample , just like electronic transport in quantum hall systems .",
    "more recently , several theoretical works have elaborated on the topological nature of one - way photonic edge modes in specific gyroelectric @xcite photonic crystals , trs breaking in microwave circuits @xcite , or the generation of artificial gauge fields for photons in coupled cavity arrays @xcite .",
    "the photonic analog of topological insulators have also been recently proposed @xcite and observed @xcite , along the same lines of previous works @xcite .",
    "however , the theoretical problem of recovering the effective photon dynamics in trs broken photonic systems , in full analogy to the electron transport theory , has been not fully explored in the literature , to our knowledge .",
    "a few early attempts to derive a topological - based photon dynamical theory were mostly focussed on systems without trs breaking @xcite , i.e. with a strict analogy with the classical hall transport properties .",
    "a rigorous derivation of the topological terms in the semiclassical equations of motion for photonic transport starting from a in direct analogy between bloch - floquet photonic modes and the magnetic bloch electron states is still lacking .    here",
    "we go beyond previous works in analyzing the analogies between electronic and photonic formalisms for trs broken 2d crystals . to this end",
    ", we will first present a perturbative approach to obtain the equations of motion for the electron transport in quantum hall systems , re - deriving the well known result that the semiclassical electron dynamics is described by @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the wave vector , @xmath2 is the band index , @xmath3 is the group velocity associated with the magnetic bloch band energy @xmath4 , @xmath5 the applied electric field , and @xmath6 the berry curvature of the gauge bundle constructed on the brillouin zone .",
    "essentially , trs breaking results in a topological correction , given by the berry curvature , to the standard equations of motion for the electron in the periodic potential of crystalline solids ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a textbook - like formulation ) .",
    "we will then apply the same formalism to maxwell equations in periodic meta - materials with gyrotropic components and weak grading along one direction , rigorously obtaining the equation for the electromagnetic mode velocity containing an analogous topological correction , as already conjectured in @xcite . as a final remark",
    ", we point out that in the present work we are mainly concerned with the link between linear photonic crystal theory and the topological aspects of single - electron transport in quantum hall systems , while we are not dealing with the interesting problem of mimicking manybody quantum states , such as the ones leading to the fractional quantum hall phenomenology @xcite , with in strongly nonlinear photonic systems @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the first part ,",
    "ii , we present a perturbative approach to derive the known results of a topological term in the single - electron semiclassical equations of motion in quantum hall systems . in the second part ,",
    "iii , we explicitly treat photonic crystals on an analog footing , by applying the same perturbative concepts from sec .",
    "ii to maxwell equations .",
    "we will then show that a combination of gyrotropic materials and weak grading of the photonic crystal permittivity along the propagation direction are able to closely mimic the semiclassical single - electron dynamics in quantum hall systems also from a topological perspective . finally , in sec .",
    "iv we give some conclusive remarks , by proposing a possible experimental setting where these geometrical aspects could be probed through photon transmission .",
    "the single - electron hamiltonian in a 2d crystal with a magnetic field applied orthogonally to the periodicity plane is @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the electron momentum , @xmath9 is the vector potential associated to the applied magnetic field @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the 2d periodic crystal potential , and @xmath12 the two - dimensional effective electron mass .",
    "the real space configuration of a quantum hall system is schematically represented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "in general , the hamiltonian ( [ eq:5 ] ) lacks translational invariance because of the presence of the vector potential , @xmath13 .",
    "however , this model is still invariant by translational symmetry if the ratio between the magnetic field flux entering the original unitary cell and the magnetic flux quantum ( @xmath14 ) is a rational number @xcite .",
    "it is then possible to extend the validity of this condition to values of @xmath15 arbitrary close to any irrational number , with a negligible error @xcite .",
    "hence , we can always assume that the eigenfunctions of ( [ eq:5 ] ) are of the bloch type @xmath16 and the eigenvalue equation reads @xmath17 where @xmath2 is now interpreted as a magnetic band index , @xmath1 is still the bloch wave vector , and @xmath18 is the periodic part of the bloch wave function .",
    "it is easy to see that using eq .",
    "( [ eq:6 ] ) it is also possible to obtain the parametric eigenvalue equation for the @xmath18 , which directly corresponds eq .",
    "( [ eq:7 ] ) and reads @xmath19    the effects of a static electric field ( the hall field , @xmath20 ) on the single - particle dynamics can be described by using a perturbative approach .",
    "the perturbed hamiltonian will be a sum of the zero - order hamiltonian , eq .",
    "( [ eq:5 ] ) , and a perturbation term given by @xmath21 up to first order in perturbation theory , the eigenvalues @xmath22 and eigenvectors @xmath23 read latexmath:[\\ ] ] in the last equation , we can use the same considerations as before regarding odd functions , from which we get @xmath173 which compared to eq .",
