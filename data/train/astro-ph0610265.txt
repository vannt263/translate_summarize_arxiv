    "after more than a decade of precision radial velocity surveys , we know that extrasolar giant planets exist around at least 515% of sun - like stars @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , these planets lie at small angular separations ( @xmath7@xmath8 ) with high contrast ( @xmath9@xmath10 ) from their host stars , and therefore , every known radial - velocity extrasolar planet is beyond the current technical limitations for direct imaging . as a result ,",
    "the physical properties of these radial velocity planets ( except for several transiting planets ) remain largely unknown . however ,",
    "recent efforts in high - contrast imaging with adaptive optics ( ao ) have lead to the discovery of two distinct sub - stellar companions , 2massw  j1207334393254  b @xcite and gq  lup  b @xcite , at wider ( @xmath9@xmath11 ) angular separations from their primary stars and with estimated masses comparable to those of known radial velocity planets ( @xmath615 jupiter masses [ ] ) . unlike the close - in ( @xmath66  au ) radial velocity planets , whose ( minimum ) masses are inferred directly from the orbital periodicity of the doppler signal , the masses of these two wider ( @xmath940  au ) companions have not been established dynamically due to their much longer orbital periods . instead , the estimated masses are based entirely on theoretical models of sub - stellar evolution @xcite .",
    "presently , such models have very few empirical constraints , and at the young ( @xmath610  myr ) ages of the two directly - imaged planetary - mass companions , their predictions are very sensitive to the initial conditions .",
    "a larger sample of empirical data on such young low - mass objects is thus necessary to calibrate and fully understand the evolution of these objects at such young ages .    in the present paper",
    "we discuss the younger of the two resolved candidate planetary - mass companions , gq  lup  b. the secondary was discovered and confirmed as a proper motion companion to gq  lup  a by @xcite .",
    "being one of the youngest low - mass sub - stellar objects discovered to date , there is considerable uncertainty in estimating the mass of gq  lup  b. @xcite argue that the widely - adopted sub - stellar evolutionary models of @xcite and @xcite , which assume an initial post - formation internal structure for sub - stellar objects , are inadequate at the young age of gq  lup because of the arbitrariness in their assumptions for the initial conditions . instead , @xcite advocate the use of a different set of models @xcite , which take into account the conditions and processes in the parent molecular cloud , and may be more adequate at very young ( @xmath121  myr ) ages . using the models of @xcite and assuming an age of @xmath121.1 myr , @xcite find that the mass of gq  lup  b may be as low as 12  , and hence that it is potentially the first extrasolar planet to be directly imaged around a star .",
    "we present new near - ir spectroscopic data on gq lup b obtained with the recently commissioned osiris ( oh suppressing infra - red imaging spectrograph ) ifs @xcite on keck (  [ sec_observations][sec_results ] ) , recalculate the age of gq lup , and address recent empirical calibrations of the sub - stellar models (  [ sec_analysis ] ) .",
    "we find that the mass of gq  lup  b is near , or more likely higher than , 13  and thus should not be considered as an extrasolar planet .",
    "finally , we place gq  lup  b in the context of other young sub - stellar objects , and discuss the implications from its co - evolution with the primordial circumstellar disk around gq  lup (  [ sec_disk ] ) .",
    "gq lup was observed on 2005 june 26 ( ut ) as a commissioning target for the osiris instrument at the w.m .",
    "keck observatory .",
    "osiris is a medium resolution ( @xmath0=3700 ) infrared ( ir ) integral field spectrograph ( ifs ) that was designed and constructed to operate behind the keck observatory s ao system @xcite .",
    "an ifs is an instrument that takes contiguous spectra over a rectangular field of view ( fov ) . in the case of osiris",
    ", a microlens array is placed in the focal plane of the instrument to separate the field points , where each lenslet becomes a spatial pixel element ( spaxel ) in the final data cube .",
    "each lenslet focuses the incident light to a pupil plane located directly behind the lenslet array .",
    "these pupils are dispersed by a diffraction grating and subsequently focused onto a detector in such a way that each spectrum lies 2 pixels above its neighbor on the detector .",
    "the osiris ifs employs a rockwell hawaii ii hgcdte detector ( 2048@xmath132048 pixels , 32 channel output ) to achieve high quantum efficiency in the @xmath14 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 bands with low read noise ( 13 -e pix@xmath15 ) .",
    "the actual near - ir filters are spectroscopic filters and do not correspond exactly to any near - ir standard .",
    "these broad bands correspond to different orders of the diffraction grating , as defined by the blaze angle .",
    "@xcite presents a comprehensive review of the osiris instrument design .",
    "we made natural guide star ( ngs ) ao observations of gq lup in the @xmath2 and @xmath3-broad bands over a 0@xmath1632@xmath131@xmath1628 fov at 0@xmath16020 spaxel@xmath15 . in each of the observations , the position angle of the long axis fov was set to 90@xmath17 in order to align the rectagular field of view along the separation axis of the gq  lup  a and b components .",
    "the @xmath2-band images were obtained in a 3 point raster scan pattern with a 0.15@xmath18 dither to the east between each of the 600  s integrations , thus moving gq  lup  a from the center of the field to just off the field of view in the final frame .",
    "the science frames were followed by a sky of similar integration time .",
    "a single 600  s @xmath3-band image was obtained of the gq  lup system , with a 3@xmath18 dither to a sky position .",
    "observing conditions were photometric , with the keck ao system running on - axis using gq  lup  a ( @xmath0=11  mag ) as the reference star .",
    "we measure the ao point spread function ( psf ) full - widths at half - maximum of gq  lup  a to be 0@xmath1606 and 0@xmath1605 at @xmath2 and @xmath3 band , respectively .",
    "afterwards , we observed the a0v star hd  152384 in the @xmath2 and @xmath3 band , with a similar instrument configuration and at a comparable airmass ( 1.78 ) as the science frames , in order to calibrate the telluric and instrumental absorption profile .",
    "the osiris data reduction pipeline ( drp ) was used to process and extract the raw , two - dimensional ( 2d ) spectra and place them back into their spatial positions , producing a data cube of two spatial dimensions @xmath19 and one wavelength dimension ( @xmath20)@xcite . as explained in @xcite , the drp consists of a main processing routine that calls data reduction modules in a sequential order to fully reduce the data from the raw frames into a final data product .",
    "the 2d raw data were first processed by performing a pair - wise sky subtraction , a removal of the spectral crosstalk associated with extremely bright spectra on one row of the detector , an adjustment of the 32 individual channels on the detector to remove any systematic bias , a rejection of electronic glitches that occur during the readout of the detector , and a cleaning of pixels overexposed by cosmic rays .",
    "the above procedures eliminate instrumental artifacts prior to the spectral extraction .",
    "the most unique step within the osiris pipeline is the extraction of the spectra from the 2d raw frames .",
    "this process requires that the psf of every lenslet position as a function of wavelength has been mapped using a white light calibration lamp .",
    "these psfs appear to be stable over many months and the calibration is performed infrequently either by the instrument team or keck staff . the extraction routine uses the spectral psfs to iteratively assign flux from a particular pixel into its corresponding lenslet spectrum . once the spectra are assigned to the appropriate lenslet , each individual spectrum is resampled onto a regular wavelength grid using linear interpolation and a global wavelength solution determined from 19 spectral arc lines .",
    "finally , the extracted spectra are inserted into their respective spatial locations in a data cube .",
    "a visual inspection of the @xmath2- and @xmath3-band data cubes confirmed the companion gq  lup  b in the position identified by @xcite .",
    "the reduced @xmath3-band image of the gq  lup system is displayed in figure  [ fig_image ] .",
    "the fully reduced data cube exhibits the effects of differential atmospheric dispersion , as demonstrated by the spatial motions of the stellar location as a function of wavelength .",
    "therefore , the profile of the differential dispersion was calculated by measuring the centroid in each of the spectral channels and fitting these data with a second order polynomial .",
    "the telluric spectra were obtained by measuring their centroids at the front of the data cube ( shortest observing @xmath20 ) and extracting from this center along the dispersion direction using a 2  spaxel ( 0@xmath16040 ) radius circular aperture .",
    "we correct for the intrinsic features in the a0v spectra by fitting lorentzian profiles to each of the hydrogen paschen and brackett lines and subtracting these fits from the original telluric spectrum .",
    "the telluric and instrument absorption profiles were removed from the final data cube by dividing each spatial location by the normalized telluric spectrum and multiplying by a normalized blackbody curve of @xmath21=10000  k ( corresponding to spectral type a0v ) .",
    "the spectra of gq  lup  a and b were extracted from the telluric corrected data cubes using the same technique that was applied to the telluric standard .",
    "however , at a separation of just 0@xmath167 the spectrum of gq  lup  b was significantly contaminated by the bright halo of its host star .",
    "we approximated the background at the companion location by extracting spectra of the halo of gq  lup  a at 1  spaxel ( @xmath22 ) intervals along a radial line connecting the host and companion .",
    "we then fit a third - order polynomial to each spectral bin as a function of radial separation , and used the interpolated halo spectrum at the distance of the companion as an estimate of the halo contamination in the spectrum of gq  lup  b. the halo contamination was subsequently subtracted from the extracted spectrum of gq lup b. the reduced @xmath2- and @xmath3-band spectra of gq  lup  b are shown in figures  [ fig_jspec_comp ] and [ fig_hspec_comp ] .",
    "we compare our @xmath2-band spectrum of gq  lup  b to the spectra of field m6l5 dwarfs from the nirspec brown dwarf spectroscopic survey of @xcite in figure  [ fig_jspec_comp]a .",
    "our @xmath0@xmath13700 spectrum from osiris has been smoothed to the @xmath0@xmath122000 resolution of the comparison nirspec spectra .",
    "the spectrum of gq  lup  b exhibits a depression due to water absorption longward of 1.33  @xmath23 consistent with the spectra of other m6l5 dwarfs in the field .",
    "however , unlike the several gyr - old field dwarfs , gq  lup  b does not show absorption at 1.243 and 1.254  @xmath23an indication that gq  lup  b has low surface gravity .",
    "a comparison with @xmath0@xmath12000 @xmath2-band spectra of m9l0 dwarfs of various ages exemplifies this point ( fig .",
    "[ fig_jspec_comp]b ) . with its lack of absorption at @xmath2 band ( 3@xmath24 upper limit of 1.2    on the equivalent width at 1.244 and 1.253  @xmath23 ) ,",
    "gq  lup  b closely resembles the @xmath121  myr m9 dwarf hc  372 in the orion nebular cluster @xcite , but not the older l0 dwarfs 2mass  j014158234633574 ( @xmath1210  myr and log ( @xmath25 ) to the theoretical models of @xcite and find their best guess age estimate is 510  myr . ] ; @xcite ; ew ( ) = 3.5@xmath260.5    at each of the two central wavelengths ) and hd  89744b ( @xmath122  gyr ; * ? ? ?",
    "the low surface gravity of gq  lup  b indicates that it is a very young brown dwarf , as we later confirm from an age analysis of its pre - main sequence primary (  [ sec_age ] ) .    a visual comparison of the @xmath2-band continuum shapes of gq  lup  b and the m6l5 dwarfs in figure  [ fig_jspec_comp]a indicates that the spectral type of gq  lup  b is intermediate between those of mid - m and early - l dwarfs .",
    "we test this result by calculating the @xmath2-band h@xmath5o indices of @xcite and @xcite , which measure the onset of water absorption at 1.34  @xmath23 .",
    "the strength of water absorption has been reported to be gravity - sensitive in the @xmath3-band , as displayed in the peaked shapes of @xmath3-band continua of young ultra - cool dwarfs @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite find that at 1.34  @xmath23 water absorption is unaffected by surface gravity in ultracool dwarfs , and is thus an adequate indicator of effective temperature .",
    "we verify this claim by applying the @xmath2-band h@xmath5o index of @xcite to the low - gravity l dwarf 2mass  j014158234633574 @xcite , and obtain a formal spectral type estimate of m9.5@xmath261.1 for that object , fully consistent with the @xmath12l0 classification of @xcite .",
    "thus , using the @xmath2-band h@xmath5o indices of @xcite and @xcite , we infer a spectral type of m6l0 for gq lup b. the range in spectral type is determined by observing the variations in the inferred spectral type as a result of small shifts ( up to 50   ) in the centers of the spectral windows used in the index definitions .",
    "this method allows a better sampling of the noise in our spectrum .",
    "the @xmath3-band spectrum of gq  lup  b is shown in figure  [ fig_hspec_comp ] , where it is compared to the spectra of the @xmath1210  myr old 2mass  j014158234633574 @xcite , and the @xmath122  gyr old hd  89744b @xcite .",
    "the sharply peaked , triangular continuum of the spectrum of gq  lup  b strongly resembles that of the young l0 object , while both differ from the plateau - shaped continuum of the older l0 dwarf .",
    "similarly shaped @xmath3-band continua have been reported in 110  myr - old late - m / early - l dwarfs before , and are now known to be indicators of low surface gravity and youth @xcite .",
    "the strong gravity - dependence of the @xmath3-band continuum shape and the lack of other obvious spectroscopic features ( though feh absorption at 1.625  @xmath23 can be seen in the higher signal - to - noise spectrum of 2mass  j014158234633574 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) prevent us from using the @xmath3-band spectrum of gq  lup  b for accurate spectroscopic classification .",
    "we only note that the overall similarity between the spectra of gq  lup  b and 2mass  j014158234633574 indicate proximity in spectral type  in agreement with our @xmath2-band spectroscopic classification (  [ sec_spectrum_j ] ) .",
    "in addition to the spectral information obtained from the osiris data cube , typical imaging measurements can be performed on the three - dimensional data cube .",
    "relative astrometry of the binary was calculated through measurements of the component centers in collapsed narrowband ( 100 spectral channel bins ) images for each of the two @xmath2-band frames that contained both gq lup a and b. we fit 2d gaussian profiles to the clearly resolved cores of the psfs of each component in order to attain their respective location in the frame .",
    "we measure the separation between the components to be 0@xmath1673@xmath260@xmath1601 with a position angle of 276.2@xmath17@xmath260.3@xmath17 .",
    "our astrometric observations are fully consistent with the values reported in @xcite , and we agree that gq lup a and b comprise a common proper motion system .",
    "magnitudes for the system were obtained by comparing the relative spectral intensities of the 2 spaxel radius extracted spectra .",
    "it was necessary to derive a flux for gq lup a instead of using the published 2mass value because this source is variable at many wavelengths (  [ sec_age ] ) .",
    "we calibrate our photometry with the telluric standard ; however , since the telluric standard was intrinsically brighter than gq lup a , the ao performance on the telluric standard was better and therefore the core of the psf was narrower .",
    "consequently , we could not directly compare the total flux of the 2 spaxel radius extracted spectrum of the telluric standard with that of gq lup a. we derive a radial profile curve of growth for both gq lup a and the telluric standard , and we approximate the total enclosed flux by assuming circular symmetry .",
    "the magnitudes were estimated from 30 spaxel radius apertures , which alleviates the effect of different psf shapes . in the @xmath2-band",
    ", we use the 2mass magnitude for the telluric standard ( hd  152384 ) to calibrate the system photometry .",
    "our derived @xmath2-band magnitude for gq lup a is @xmath2=8.69@xmath260.04 mag , which is consistent with the 2mass quoted value of 8.605@xmath260.021 , meaning that the system is in the same photometric state .",
    "however , in the @xmath3-band , we find that our derived magnitude for gq lup a is @xmath3=8.0@xmath260.2 mag , a value significantly larger than the 2mass value of 7.702@xmath260.033 mag .",
    "this inconsistency is probably due to errors in fitting the radial profile for gq lup a since the @xmath3-band center of gq lup a is on a spaxel at the edge of the field of view ( see figure  [ fig_image ] ) , instead of some intrinsic color variability of gq lup a. for this reason , we calculate the gq lup b @xmath3-band magnitude using the 2mass magnitude quoted for gq lup a , but we propagate an appropriate error term to account for this discrepancy .",
    "we find that gq lup b has @xmath2=14.90@xmath260.11 mag ( @xmath27@xmath2=6.21@xmath260.12 mag ) and @xmath3=15.2@xmath260.5 mag ( @xmath27@xmath3=7.5@xmath260.5 mag ) . as mentioned above",
    ", these near - ir magnitudes are unique to the osiris instrument where each filter corresponds to the different orders of the diffraction grating .",
    "following @xcite , we estimate that for an object of spectral type m6l0 , an error of @xmath120.1 magnitudes is necessary to translate to the standard near - ir standard filters in the @xmath2 or @xmath3-band , and this error has been added to our uncertainty .",
    "in order to determine the luminosity and model - dependent mass of gq  lup  b , we need accurate estimates of its distance from the sun and its intrinsic age . we will assume throughout this discussion that gq  lup  b is gravitationally bound to gq  lup  a , which implies that it resides at an identical heliocentric distance as the primary .",
    "we also assume that physical association in the binary implies coeval formation .",
    "the final spectral type of gq  lup  b is consistent with , albeit somewhat earlier than , the m9l4 determination from @xmath4-band spectroscopy in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the estimates in these two papers are primarily based on the continuum slope around 2.0  @xmath23 , where spectra of ultra - cool dwarfs exhibit h@xmath5o absorption .",
    "the effect of surface gravity on this absorption band has not been empirically determined , and it is possible that enhanced water absorption in low surface gravity photospheres may be depressing the continuum near 2  @xmath23 , thus making objects appear cooler .",
    "such an interpretation draws an analogy with the perceived role of water absorption in creating the peaked @xmath3-band continua of young ultra - cool dwarfs @xcite .",
    "however , the lack of sensitivity to surface gravity of the 1.34  @xmath23 water absorption band @xcite is perplexing in this context .",
    "a more self - consistent picture of the shapes of the near - ir spectra of young ultra - cool dwarf near - ir spectral shape has been recently offered by @xcite .",
    "these authors argue that , rather than due to enhanced water absorption , the triangular - shaped continua at @xmath3-band are caused by a reduction in h@xmath5 collision induced absorption ( cia ) at low surface gravity @xcite .",
    "@xcite show that at the temperatures of late - m and early - l dwarfs ( @xmath1223002500  k ) h@xmath5 cia peaks in strength near 2.5  @xmath23 , and weakens toward shorter wavelengths , or with decreasing surface gravity .",
    "@xcite find that the theoretical picture of @xcite correctly predicts two main features of young late - m / early - l dwarfs : redder @xmath28 colors and peaked @xmath3-band continua . indeed , employing the @xmath29 magnitude from @xcite with the photometry presented herein , we find a @xmath2-@xmath29 color of 1.8@xmath260.1 mag , significantly redder than the @xmath2-@xmath4@xmath30=1.01.2 for typical field m6-l0 dwarfs @xcite . given the decreasing strength of h@xmath5 cia toward shorter wavelengths , this interpretation also explains the diminished sensitivity to surface gravity in the depth of the 1.34  @xmath23 water absorption band in ultra - cool dwarfs .",
    "the effect is strongest at @xmath4-band , where the decreasing strength of h@xmath5 cia with decreasing surface gravity makes the continuum redder . in particular",
    ", @xmath4-band spectroscopic classification of young ultra - cool dwarfs based on the water - band continuum slope near 2  @xmath23 will produce later spectral types than other classification schemes ( e.g. , spectral types based on the strength of the 1.34  @xmath23 water band ) .",
    "hence , this scenario offers an explanation of the slightly later spectral type obtained for gq  lup  b by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a comparison of the absolute magnitude of gq  lup  b with other similiarly young brown dwarfs suggests that gq  lup  b is , in fact , of an earlier spectral type than @xmath12l0 . at an @xmath31  mag ( adopting a distance of 150+/-20 pc to gq lup ;  [ sec_dist ] ) ,",
    "gq  lup  b is 12  mag brighter than the 110  myr @xmath12m9.5 dwarfs ots  44 ( @xmath32  mag ) and cha  110913773444 ( @xmath33  mag ) in chamaeleon @xcite , and the 15  myr old m9/l0 binary oph  162225240515  a / b ( @xmath34  mag ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in ophiuchus . in addition , gq  lup  b is also of approximately the same bolometric luminosity ( @xmath35 ;  [ sec_mass ] ) and age as the 35  myr m7m7.5 dwarfs usco  128 and usco  130 ( @xmath36 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in upper scorpius",
    ". therefore , our mean spectral type estimate of m8 for gq  lup  b is in agreement with expectations when compared to the spectral types of similar objects from the literature .",
    "a different explanation for the discrepancy between the spectral types of gq  lup  b inferred in the present work and in @xcite may be suggested as a result of previously noted difficulties in reproducing the correct continuum slopes of objects observed with ao long - slit spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "the width of spectroscopic slits used with ao is often 12 times the fwhm of the psf ( @xmath1260  mas at 2.2  @xmath23 on 810  meter class telescopes ) , and of order of the accuracy ( @xmath120  mas ) with which an object can be positioned and maintained on the slit during dithers . because the psf possesses a strong radial chromatic gradient , any misalignment of the target on the slit can lead to an artificial change in the measured continuum .",
    "furthermore , in high - contrast observations of binary systems ( i.e. , when one object is much fainter than the other ) it is desirable to have the slit oriented along the binary axis to allow accurate determination of the contamination of the secondary spectrum by the halo of the primary . as a result , spectroscopy of binaries rarely benefits from having the slit oriented along the parallactic angle , and can suffer additional slit losses due to differential atmospheric refraction ( dar ) , especially at high ( @xmath371.5 ) airmasses and short ( @xmath61.5@xmath23 ) wavelengths .    given that @xcite observed gq  lup at @xmath4 band and at low ( @xmath71.1 ) airmass , the above described slit losses due to dar are negligible .",
    "however , the effect of potential misalignment of gq  lup  b and the slit could be significant .",
    "@xcite find that a misalignment equal to half the slit width changes the measured continuum slope by 78% per @xmath23 at @xmath3 band .",
    "the effect is likely less pronounced at @xmath4 band , and the width of the slit used by @xcite ( 172  mas ) is larger than that of the one used by @xcite ( 100  mas ) in their experiment .",
    "hence , maintaining adequate alignment on the slit should have been easier to achieve in the case of the @xmath4-band spectroscopic observations of gq  lup  b by @xcite .",
    "therefore , we conclude it is improbable that slit losses have significantly altered their @xmath4-band continuum shape , and that the likely reason for the discrepancy between the spectral types of gq  lup  b inferred by @xcite and in the present work remains h@xmath5 cia .",
    "gq  lup  a is a t  tauri star located in the lupus  1 star - forming region @xcite . with a visual magnitude of @xmath38  mag @xcite ,",
    "it is too faint to have a trigonometric parallax measurement from _",
    "however , its heliocentric distance can be inferred from the distance to its parent molecular cloud ; as determined from interstellar reddening , polarization , or absorption in the spectra of objects along the same line of sight , or from the mean distance to brighter early - type members of the cloud . @xcite and @xcite summarize the available distance estimates for gq  lup from the literature , and converge on a value of 140@xmath2650  pc .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . a more precise estimate can be obtained from a joint comparative analysis of the techniques employed in the various studies , and by discriminating among the four sub - groups @xcite of the lupus molecular cloud complex .",
    "such a comprehensive analysis is presented in @xcite , who concludes that the mean distance to the entire molecular cloud complex , and to lupus  1 in particular , is @xmath1150  pc . according to @xcite , the near edge of the lupus  1",
    "cloud is at least 130140  pc away , based on studies of interstellar polarization @xcite and absorption @xcite toward lupus  1 .",
    "hence , we conservatively adopt a 20  pc uncertainty in the inferred 150  pc distance to lupus  1 .      from a comparison to stellar evolutionary models ,",
    "@xcite find that the age of gq  lup  a is between 0.1  myr and 2  myr .",
    "while this is less than the median age ( 3  myr ) of the lupus star - forming region @xcite , this region contains both classical and weak - line t  tauri populations that may have different ages .",
    "the lupus  1 and 2 sub - regions , in particular , have the highest concentration of classical t tauri stars and are considered to be the youngest ( 0.11  myr ; * ? ? ?",
    "the location of gq  lup in lupus  1 indicates that indeed an age younger than 3  myr may be warranted .",
    "however , we note that gq  lup has alternately been classified both as a weak - line t  tauri star ( h@xmath39 equivalent width of 2.8   ; * ? ? ? * ) and as a classical t  tauri star ( h@xmath39 equivalent width of 38.6   ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the variation in the strength of its h@xmath39 emission precludes a conclusive association with either the classical or weak - line populations in lupus .",
    "therefore , we proceed to derive an independent estimate of the age of gq  lup .",
    "we use @xmath0- and cousins @xmath40-band photometry from the literature to place gq  lup on a @xmath41 vs.  @xmath42 color - magnitude diagram and compare its position to the predictions of theoretical models for pre - main - sequence stars .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath40 bands are not strongly affected by excess uv and ir emission , and are thus suitable proxies for the bolometric luminosities and effective temperatures of pre - main - sequence stars . @xmath0- and @xmath40-band photometry of pre - main - sequence stars is also often obtained simultaneously- and @xmath2-band photometry are another suitable filter pair for estimating bolometric luminosities and effective temperatures , but these filter complements require two different detectors . ] , and thus allows self - consistent measurements of the color of variable stars .",
    "this is a particularly important consideration in the case of gq  lup , which is strongly variable ( up to 2  mag at @xmath43 ; * ? ? ?",
    "gq  lup is further known to have non - negligible visual extinction , where reports vary in the literature@xmath44  mag @xcite , @xmath45  mag @xcite , or @xmath46  mag @xcite . barring systematic differences in the approaches used to determine the visual extinction in the three cases ,",
    "the variability in visual extinction may be linked to the photometric variability of gq  lup , pointing to a probable circumstellar origin for the extinction .",
    "such a conclusion is supported by simultaneous @xmath47 monitoring observations of gq  lup , from which @xcite find that the changes in the optical colors approximately follow a standard interstellar extinction law .",
    "we adopt the mean of the above extinction values and their standard deviation , i.e. , @xmath48  mag , as representative of the extinction toward gq  lup at any given time , and use the interstellar extinction law of @xcite to convert @xmath49 to @xmath0- and @xmath40-band extinction .",
    "gq  lup is also known to exhibit variable veiling in its optical spectrum @xcite , with the amount of excess emission ( @xmath50 ) being 0.51.5 times the photospheric level ( @xmath51 ) at @xmath43-band , and 1.04.5 times at @xmath52-band .",
    "veiling of the optical continuum in t tauri stars occurs as a result of excess emission at the location where the accretion column collides with the stellar surface in a radiative shock . adopting a simple blackbody model for the veiling with the derived effective temperatures in @xcite ,",
    "we find that the veiling of gq  lup makes , on average , the @xmath40-band photometry 0.35  mag brighter ( amplitude of variation : @xmath260.24  mag ) and the @xmath42 color 0.15  mag bluer ( amplitude of variation : @xmath260.07  mag ) .",
    "figure  [ fig_cmd ] shows the photometric measurements of gq  lup from each of four separate optical data sets .",
    "solid circles and solid triangles show the original data , without de - reddening and de - veiling , whereas the open circles and open triangles correspond to the de - reddened and de - veiled data .",
    "the error bars on the photometry and colors correspond to the quadrature sum of the amplitude of the observed variability and the 1@xmath24 uncertainty ( 0.32  mag ) in the distance modulus . for the de - reddened and de - veiled data we also include the full ranges of the inferred reddening and veiling .",
    "also overlaid are isochrones ( solid curves ) and evolutionary tracks ( dashed curves ) from @xcite with the mixing length parameter @xmath53 . in a comparative analysis of theoretical evolutionary tracks , @xcite find that this set of models most accurately predicts the dynamical masses of pre - main - sequence stars .",
    "as is evident in figure  [ fig_cmd ] , the photometric data reveal that the age of gq  lup is @xmath13  myr , although ages from 1  myr to @xmath1250  myr are within the allowed @xmath41 and @xmath42 locus .",
    "an age @xmath910  myr can be excluded if we treat gq lup a as a classical t  tauri star which are not typically found in associations older than @xmath1210  myr ( the approximate age of the tw  hya association ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , we argue that because circumstellar extinction probably contributes significantly to the observed variability , we need to weigh the data in figure  [ fig_cmd ] more heavily toward higher luminosities ( i.e. , younger ages ) , which likely represent the unextincted state . we therefore conclude that gq  lup is @xmath13  myr old , with a possible age range of 110  myr , i.e. , marginally older than the 1@xmath261  myr estimate of @xcite .",
    "our age estimate for gq  lup from the evolutionary tracks of @xcite suggests an older age for the lupus  1 star - forming region as a whole , than the currently quoted value of 0.11  myr .",
    "the latter age range was derived by @xcite based on models from @xcite , which have now been shown to systematically under - estimate the masses of pre - main - sequence stars @xcite .",
    "indeed , at an inferred age of 0.1  myr , gq  lup is ranked as one of the youngest stars in lupus according to @xcite our updated , older age for gq  lup indicates that the entire region is probably @xmath110 times older than found by @xcite , i.e. , 110  myr .",
    "the color - magnitude diagram in figure  [ fig_cmd ] contains all fourteen lupus  1 members listed in @xcite . for all stars",
    "we have adopted the photometry and extinctions listed in table  3 of @xcite and the same veiling as for gq  lup .",
    "figure  [ fig_cmd ] demonstrates that the majority of the lupus  1 members are at least 3  myr - old , with an age scatter of 1100  myr .",
    "however , ages of @xmath910  myr would be highly unusual for any members in this molecular cloud , which has a high incidence of classical t  tauri stars . barring major inaccuracies in the @xcite models , the old appearance of some of the stars",
    "could be explained by local deviations from the adopted interstellar extinction law .",
    "indeed , because of dust grain growth in primordial circumstellar disks , extinction and reddening due to circumstellar dust is not always described adequately by the standard interstellar medium ( ism ) extinction law , which holds for grains 0.010.1  @xmath23 in size .",
    "instead , circumstellar extinction is often more neutral in color ( `` gray '' ) , especially in systems with close to edge - on viewing geometries , where the light from the central source passes through a non - negligible part of the disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "hence , because @xcite determine extinctions based on observed @xmath42 colors and a priori known spectral types , the inferred ism - like extinctions may under - estimate the actual ones . as a result , on a color - magnitude diagram",
    "the stars would appear fainter , but not redder .",
    "that is , the stars would appear older .",
    "it is possible that some of the de - reddened and de - veiled data points in figure  [ fig_cmd ] , especially along the older isochrones , under - estimate the actual unextincted stellar luminosities and ages .",
    "an upper age limit of @xmath1210  myr can be inferred by comparison to the tw  hya association , which is the oldest stellar association known to harbor classical t  tauri stars .",
    "considering the upper envelope of the data , which presumably are least affected by gray extinction , there is a strong reason to believe that the stellar population in the lupus  1 molecular cloud is @xmath541  myr old .",
    "the above reasoning leads us to infer that the age of lupus  1 is 110  myr , or 10 times older on average than previously presumed .",
    "similar analysis leads to an analogous conclusion for the ages of other young star - forming regions of ages comparable to that of lupus 1 ( e.g. , taurus ) . in view of the continuous improvement in stellar evolutionary models , a broad re - analysis of stellar ages in star - forming regions",
    "may indeed be necessary in the future .",
    "however , given the remaining uncertainties in the theory at @xmath121  myr ages , we can not claim a need for a significant re - evaluation of pre - main - sequence ages , despite the relative success of the @xcite models of the lyon group in reproducing dynamical masses of pre - main - sequence stars .",
    "we adopt these models to estimate the age of gq  lup ( and lupus  1 ) in the present analysis to ensure self - consistency with the evolutionary models ( * ? ? ?",
    "* also from the lyon group ) that we will use to estimate the mass of gq  lup  b (  [ sec_mass ] ) .",
    "in addition to being some of the most widely used and successful (  [ sec_mass ] ) sub - stellar evolutionary models to date ( the other set coming from the arizona group ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the sub - stellar evolutionary models of @xcite allow us to estimate the mass of gq  lup  b based on the same theoretical framework used in estimating the age of the primary .",
    "we base our estimate of the mass of gq  lup  b on the the models of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we obtain its bolometric luminosity using the derived @xmath2 magnitude , our distance estimate (  [ sec_dist ] ) , and @xmath4-band bolometric corrections for m6l0 dwarfs from @xcite .",
    "although based solely on optical  near - ir data , the values of the bolometric corrections have been largely confirmed by recent 5.538  @xmath23 _ spitzer_/irs spectra of ultra - cool dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the bolometric corrections are translated from the @xmath4 to @xmath2 band assuming the @xmath2-@xmath4 color for m6-l0 dwarfs is 1.1@xmath260.1 mag @xcite .",
    "we note that the bolometric corrections in @xcite are compiled from data for @xmath91  gyr - old , high - surface gravity field dwarfs , and may need to be corrected for the expected @xmath11  dex lower surface gravity of gq  lup  b. the sense and magnitude of this correction is unknown empirically , as the body of data on young ultra - cool dwarfs is extremely limited .",
    "we use the models of @xcite to infer that the correction to bc@xmath55 for a + 1  dex change in surface gravity is @xmath10.15  mag .",
    "we adopt @xmath260.10  mag as an error estimate for the surface gravity correction to bc@xmath56 , i.e. , of the same order as the precision of empirical bolometric corrections .",
    "we have not applied an extinction correction to our @xmath2-band photometry . at @xmath2-band",
    "the amount of extinction is only a third of the visual extinction ( for an ism extinction law ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and given the adopted @xmath48  mag toward gq  lup  a it would be @xmath57  mag , i.e. , the estimated luminosity of gq  lup  b would increase by @xmath130% . however , we choose not to apply this correction because we concluded that the extinction toward gq  lup  a is probably circumstellar in origin (  [ sec_age ] ) .",
    "given the relatively wide separation ( @xmath1110  au ) between the primary and the secondary , and the lack of evidence ( e.g. , much higher circum - primary extinction ) for a high - optical - depth edge - on viewing geometry for the system , we believe that near - ir light from the secondary is negligibly extincted by dust in the circum - primary disk .",
    "the resulting estimate for the bolometric luminosity of gq  lup  b is @xmath58 .",
    "the effective temperature estimate is 2450  k with a range of 23002900  k , corresponding to the spectral type m8@xmath262 , according to the t@xmath59/spectral type relation from @xcite .",
    "comparisons of these values with sub - stellar evolutionary models from @xcite and @xcite are presented in figure  [ fig_mass ] .",
    "we estimate the mass of gq  lup  b at @xmath120.0120.040  based on its bolometric luminosity , or @xmath120.0100.040  based on its effective temperature . despite the use of the same photometry ,",
    "our mass estimate for gq  lup  b is a factor of @xmath121.52 higher than that of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* based on the same models ) , largely because of the older age that we estimate for the primary (  [ sec_age ] ) .",
    "we have not performed a detailed estimate of the mass of gq  lup  b based on the models of @xcite as done in @xcite because these models are not publicly available . nevertheless ,",
    "if we overlay the values for the effective temperature and luminosity of gq  lup  b on an h - r diagram containing tracks from @xcite ( e.g. , figure  4 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we confirm the 12  mass estimate of @xcite this result is favored by @xcite , who argue that at the very young age of gq  lup the models of @xcite provide a more realistic account of the collapse and formation of sub - stellar objects . @xcite and @xcite model sub - stellar evolution only post - collapse , by assuming a pre - existing fully convective internal structure which is adiabatic at all stages of evolution ( i.e. , a `` hot start '' ) .",
    "such models are thus uncertain at ages up to a few myr @xcite , and may be inadequate for the @xmath123  myr - old gq  lup  b. however , @xcite argue that the version of the @xcite models used by @xcite , based on a core - accretion  gas - capture scenario within a circumstellar disk , are also inappropriate at the young age of gq  lup because they may not allow sufficient time for the formation of the secondary .",
    "the decision of which models to use in this scenario is therefore best taken in the context of existing empirical constraints on the models .",
    "dynamical masses of very young sub - stellar objects did not exist at the time of the investigation of @xcite , but the first dynamical masses were recently reported for the @xmath121  myr - old eclipsing sub - stellar binary 2mass  j053521840546085  a / b @xcite .",
    "we use this young brown - dwarf binary to decide which set of models is more accurate at predicting the mass of the objects in this system . we find that the `` hot - start '' models reproduce the individual component masses at an age of 1  myr to within 30% of their dynamically measured values .",
    "@xcite s evolutionary tracks , on the other hand , under - predict the dynamical masses by a factor of @xmath123too large a discrepancy to be explained by , e.g. , a potential 15  myr under - estimate of the age of the binary .",
    "while we acknowledge that 2mass  j053521840546085  a / b provides only two empirical data points , and that a broader comparison between data and theory will be needed to conclusively test the models , we consider the above test a sufficient demonstration that the `` hot - start '' models are more accurate at ages of 13  myr , and favor their predictions for the mass of gq  lup  b. hence , we conclude that gq  lup  b is not a jupiter - like object in its initial phase of contraction , but rather a @xmath5410 times heavier brown dwarf .",
    "gq  lup is known to possess a strong ir excess ( fig .",
    "[ fig_sed ] ) from _ iras _ @xcite that signals the presence of an optically thick circumstellar disk .",
    "the co - existence of this disk with a low - mass sub - stellar companion is highly relevant for theories of planet and brown - dwarf formation .",
    "the initial claim of @xcite that the mass of gq  lup  b could be as small as 1  posed significant difficulties for planet - formation theories .",
    "the existence of such a young planet at @xmath9100  au from its host star required that the planet formed in the denser inner reaches ( @xmath1230  au ) of the stellar system and was then ejected through a dynamical interaction with a more massive third body @xcite .",
    "while realizing the obvious bias in favor of discovering such ejected planets through direct imaging , a conceptually simpler account of the formation of gq  lup  b may offer a more viable solution . in view of our present results , the requirement that gq  lup  b must have formed near its present separation can be satisfied given the higher inferred mass for the companion . at a minimum mass of 10  @xmath60 ,",
    "gq  lup  b is more massive than the opacity mass limit for turbulent fragmentation ( @xmath125  ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , the gq  lup  a / b system probably formed through direct collapse and fragmentation of the parent molecular cloud into a binary .",
    "moreover , as pointed out by @xcite , gq  lup  a / b is far from unique in the realm of wide ( @xmath9100  au ) very low mass ratio ( @xmath61 ) binaries , where it is joined by systems such as hr  7329  a / b @xcite , ab  pic a / b @xcite , and most recently , hd  203030  a / b @xcite and hn  peg  a / b @xcite .",
    "the characteristics of these objects suggest formation through cloud fragmentation , and we infer that gq  lup  a / b followed the same formation scenario .",
    "we have presented near - ir integral field spectroscopic ao observations of the gq  lup  a / b binary system obtained with the osiris ifs on keck .",
    "our results demonstrate the utility of adaptive optics ifs spectroscopy in studying faint close - in sub - stellar companions buried in the complex speckle - dominated haloes of bright stars .",
    "our @xmath2- and @xmath3-band spectra of gq  lup  b show the typical characteristics of very young ultra - cool dwarfs , such as the lack of alkali absorption and triangularly shaped @xmath3-band continua . from our @xmath2-band spectra , we determine a spectral type of m6l0 for gq  lup  b , in marginal agreement with previous @xmath4-band spectroscopy from @xcite , who find m9l4 .",
    "we argue that the difference in the spectral type estimates from the @xmath2- and @xmath4-band spectroscopy arises from the sensitivity to surface gravity of the 2  @xmath23 continuum slope indices used by @xcite , and that the true spectral type of gq  lup  b is indeed earlier .",
    "this claim is sustained by a comparison of gq  lup  b to other sub - stellar objects of similar luminosities in young stellar associations of similar ages . following a careful analysis of the age and heliocentric distance of gq  lup  a",
    ", we conclude that the mass of gq  lup  b is 0.0100.040  .",
    "the mass estimate is based on the `` hot - start '' models from @xcite and @xcite , and is @xmath54510 times higher than the mass predicted by the core - accretion  gas - capture models of @xcite .",
    "we favor the use of the `` hot - start '' models because they more accurately predict the dynamical masses of the newly - discovered @xcite 1  myr brown - dwarf binary 2mass  j053521840546085  a / b .",
    "the inferred mass of gq  lup  b makes it an improbable wide - orbit analog of the present population of @xmath715  radial - velocity extra - solar planets .",
