    "the design of effective numerical methods for solving structured generalized eigenvalue problems has recently attracted a great deal of attention .",
    "palindromic matrix polynomials arise in many applications @xcite .",
    "an @xmath0 matrix polynomial of degree @xmath1 @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , is said to be t - palindromic if @xmath6 for @xmath7 .",
    "it is well - known @xcite , @xcite that the palindromic structure induces certain spectral symmetries : in particular if @xmath8 is an eigenvalue of @xmath9 then @xmath10 is also an eigenvalue of @xmath9 .",
    "numerical solution methods are generally asked to preserve these symmetries .",
    "the customary approach for polynomial eigenproblems consists in two steps : first @xmath9 is linearized into a matrix pencil @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and then the eigenvalues of @xmath13 are computed by some iterative solver .",
    "the usual choice of the matrix qz algorithm applied to a companion linearization @xcite of @xmath9 is implemented in the matlab function _ polyeig_. an alternative solver based on the ehrlich - aberth root finding algorithm is proposed in @xcite for dealing with certain structured linearizations .",
    "specifically the method of @xcite is designed to solve generalized tridiagonal eigenvalue problems but virtually , as shown below , it can be extended to several other rank structures . a generalization for tridiagonal quadratic eigenvalue problems",
    "is presented in @xcite . a similar strategy using newton s iteration directly applied to compute the zeros of @xmath9",
    "is pursued in @xcite .",
    "modified methods for palindromic eigenproblems which are able to preserve their spectral symmetries have been proposed in several papers .",
    "the construction of t - palindromic linearizations of palindromic eigenproblems is the subject of @xcite and @xcite , whereas numerical methods based on matrix iterations have been devised in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for computing the eigenvalues of these linearizations by maintaining the palindromic structure throughout the computation . to date , however , the authors are not aware of any specific adaptation of the root - finding based methods to palindromic structures .",
    "the contribution of this paper is to fill the gap by developing a root finder specifically suited for t - palindromic matrix polynomials , with particular emphasis on the case of large degree .",
    "t - palindromic polynomials of large even degree arise as truncation of fourier series in several applications such as spectral theory , filtering problems , optimal control and multivariate discrete time series prediction @xcite .",
    "the polynomial root - finding paradigm is a flexible , powerful and quite general tool for solving both structured and unstructured polynomial eigenproblems . in its basic form it proceeds in four steps :    1 .",
    "the matrix polynomial is represented in some convenient polynomial basis .",
    "2 .   the transformed polynomial is linearized .",
    "the linearization is reduced in the customary hessenberg - triangular form .",
    "a root - finding method is applied for approximating the eigenvalues of the ( reduced ) pencil .",
    "this scheme has some degrees of freedom concerning the choice of the polynomial basis at step 1 and the choice of the linearization at step 2 which can be used to exploit both structural and root properties of the matrix polynomial .",
    "the complexity heavily depends on the efficiency of the polynomial zero - finding method applied to the determinant of the pencil .",
    "steps 2 and 3 are optional but can substantially improve the numerical and computational properties of the method .",
    "some caution should be used at step 1 since the change of the basis could modify the spectral structure of the matrix polynomial .",
    "the key idea we propose for the implementation of step 4 is the use of the jacobi formula @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that , although in this paper we focus on palindromics and on a version of the method that is able to extract the palindromic spectral structure , this strategy may be used to address the most general case of an unstructured matrix polynomial eigenproblem , for instance by applying it to the companion linearization .",
    "an analysis of the application of the method to a generic matrix polynomial will appear elsewhere .",
    "in this paper we consider the polynomial root - finding paradigm for solving t - palindromic eigenproblems .",
    "in particular , we address the main theoretical and computational issues arising at steps 1 , 2 and 4 of the previous scheme applied to t - palindromic matrix polynomials , and also we indicate briefly how to carry out the reduction at step 3 .",
    "the proposed approach relies upon the representation and manipulation of t - palindromic matrix polynomials in a different degree - graded polynomial basis @xmath14 , namely the dickson basis , satisfying a three - term recurrence relation and defined by @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 for @xmath18 . for the given t - palindromic polynomial @xmath9 of degree",
    "@xmath19 we determine a novel polynomial @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , with the property that if @xmath24 and @xmath25 are two distinct ( i.e. @xmath26 ) finite semi - simple eigenvalues of @xmath9 with multiplicity @xmath27 , then @xmath28 is a semi - simple eigenvalue for @xmath29 with multiplicity @xmath30 .",
    "moreover , we find that @xmath31 ^ 2 = p(y ) \\cdot p(y),\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is a polynomial of degree @xmath33 at most .",
    "solving the algebraic equation @xmath34 is at the core of our method for t - palindromic eigenproblems .",
    "our computational experience in polynomial root - finding indicates that the ehrlich - aberth method @xcite , @xcite for the simultaneous approximation of polynomial zeros realizes a quite good balancing between the quality of convergence and the cost per iteration .",
    "the main requirements for the effective implementation of the ehrlich - aberth method are both a fast , robust and stable procedure to evaluate the newton correction @xmath35 and a reliable criterion to stop the iteration .",
    "concerning the first issue it is worth noting that @xmath36 and , therefore , the computation immediately reduces to evaluating the newton correction of @xmath37 .",
    "a suitable structured linearization @xmath38 of @xmath29 can be obtained following @xcite which displays a semiseparable structure . in this way , in view of the celebrated jacobi formula@xcite @xmath39 , the newton correction can be evaluated by performing a qr factorization of @xmath38 , say @xmath40 , at low computational cost and fulfilling the desired requirements of robustness and stability . also , since @xmath41 for @xmath42 we obtain at no additional cost a reliable stop condition based on an estimate of the backward error given by higham and higham @xcite .",
    "if @xmath1 , the degree of the matrix polynomial , is large with respect to @xmath43 , the size of its matrix coefficients , our approach looks appealing since with a smart choice of the starting points it needs @xmath44 operations , whereas the qz method makes use of @xmath45 operations .",
    "the unpleasant factor @xmath46 in our cost estimate depends on the block structure of the linearization used in our current implementation and can in principle be decreased by performing the preliminary reduction of the linearization in hessenberg - triangular form as stated at step 3 of the basic scheme .",
    "the reduction can be carried out by a structured method exploiting the semiseparable structure of the block linearization to compute a rank - structured hessenberg - triangular linearization .",
    "incorporating the structured method in our implementation would finally lead to a fast method that outperforms the qz algorithm for large degrees and is comparable in cost for small degrees .    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the theoretical properties of the considered linearizations of t - palindromic matrix polynomials expressed in the dickson basis are investigated in section [ teo ] and [ teo1 ] .",
    "the derivation of the proposed eigenvalue method for t - palindromic eigenproblems is established in section [ main1 ] and [ main2 ] .",
    "the complete algorithm is described in section [ alg ] .",
    "numerical experiments are presented in section [ exp ] to illustrate the robustness of our implementation and to indicate computational issues and possible improvements of our algorithm compared with other existing methods .",
    "finally , conclusion and future work are discussed in section [ end ] .",
    "this preparatory section recalls some basic definitions , background facts and notations used throughout the paper .    for @xmath47 let @xmath48 , @xmath49 , be constant matrices and consider the matrix polynomial @xmath50 .",
    "the generalized polynomial eigenproblem ( pep ) associated to @xmath51 is to find an eigenvalue @xmath52 and a corresponding nonzero eigenvector @xmath53 satisfying @xmath54 in this paper , we will always suppose that @xmath51 is _ regular _",
    ", i.e. its determinant does not identically vanish .",
    "a _ linearization _ of @xmath51 is defined as a pencil @xmath55 , with @xmath56 , such that there exist unimodular polynomial matrices @xmath57 and @xmath58 for which @xmath59 moreover , if one defines the reversal of a matrix polynomial as rev@xmath60 , the linearization is said to be _ strong _ whenever rev@xmath61 is a linearization of rev@xmath62 .    following the work of mackey , mackey , mehl and mehrmann @xcite , in the paper @xcite higham , mackey , mackey and tisseur study the two ( right and left ) _ ansatz vector linearization spaces _ : having introduced the vector @xmath63 , these spaces are defined as follows : @xmath64 it is shown in @xcite that almost every pencil in these spaces is a linearization , while in @xcite two binary operations on block matrices , called column shifted sum and row shifted sum , are first introduced and then used to characterize the above defined spaces .",
    "on the other hand , in @xcite amiraslani , corless and lancaster consider linearizations of a matrix polynomial expressed in some polynomial bases different than the usual monomial one .",
    "equation ( 7 ) in @xcite resembles closely the defining equation of @xmath65 .",
    "the authors themselves stress this analogy , that suggests an extension of the results of @xcite to the case of different polynomial bases .",
    "let @xmath66 be a basis for the polynomials of degree less than or equal to @xmath1 . in @xcite degree - graded bases that satisfy a three - terms recurrence relation ( for instance ,",
    "orthogonal polynomials always do so ) are considered : @xmath67 the @xmath68 are obviously linked to the leading - term coefficients of the @xmath69 . specifically , calling @xmath70 such coefficients , one has that @xmath71 .",
    "we wish to consider the expansion of the polynomial @xmath51 in this basis : @xmath72 we introduce the vector @xmath73 by generalizing the linearizations studied in @xcite , for each choice of @xmath74 two new ansatz vector linearization spaces can be defined : @xmath75 it is worth noticing that it is not strictly necessary for the new basis to be degree - graded , nor it is to satisfy a three - term recurrence relation .",
    "in fact , it is sufficient that @xmath76 are linearly independent and have degree less than or equal to @xmath77 , so that there exists an invertible basis change matrix @xmath78 such that @xmath79 .",
    "the basis is degree - graded if and only if @xmath78 is lower triangular .    in the light of the above definitions it is immediately seen that the main results of @xcite , @xcite remain valid in the case of a more general polynomial basis . in particular the following result holds .",
    "[ prop2 ] let @xmath80 @xmath81 .",

    "_ it is a corollary of theorem 4.3 of @xcite .",
    "in fact , any @xmath84 @xmath85 can be written as @xmath86 @xmath87 for some @xmath88 @xmath89 .",
    "therefore , @xmath82 has each of the three properties above if and only if @xmath90 has the corresponding property .",
    "@xmath91    this proposition guarantees that almost every ( more precisely , all but a closed nowhere dense set of measure zero ) pencil in @xmath92 @xmath81 is a strong linearization for @xmath83 . for a proof , see theorem 4.7 of @xcite .",
    "the eigenvectors of @xmath82 are related to those of @xmath83 .",

    "moreover , if @xmath82 is a linearization then every eigenvector of @xmath82 is of the form @xmath95 for some eigenvector @xmath96 of @xmath83 .",
    "a similar recovery property holds for the left ansatz vector linearizations .",

    "roughly speaking , lemma [ laurent ] makes us able to switch between regular and laurent polynomials without worrying about changes in eigenvalues and generalized eigenvectors .",
    "actually , this result can be slightly generalized with the next lemma , which is just an adaptation of a well - known result in @xcite for the case where the four matrix functions that we are going to consider are polynomials . in order to prove the lemma , we recall @xcite that a vector polynomial @xmath119 is called a root polynomial of order @xmath120 corresponding to @xmath52 for the matrix polynomial @xmath51 if the following conditions are satisfied : @xmath121    obviously a root polynomial of order @xmath120 is defined up to an additive term of the form @xmath122 for any suitable vector polynomial @xmath123 .",

    "the shortcoming is that the jordan structure at @xmath210 changes .",
    "let @xmath211 be a polynomial of even degree .",
    "by lemma [ laurent ] , switching to the laurent form is not harmful for finite nonzero eigenvalues and the corresponding ( generalized ) eigenvectors ; we can therefore consider its laurent counterpart @xmath212    three different kinds of palindromic structure can be defined .",

    "the proposed approach can however be described very easily with purely palindromic polynomials .",
    "thus we first consider this case for the sake of clarity .",
    "the most obvious way to deal with this kind of palindromicity is via introduction of the change of variable @xmath220 , in order to halve the degree of the polynomial .",
    "more explicitly , one can define @xmath221 ; clearly , the purely palindromic structure of @xmath51 guarantees that @xmath222 is itself a polynomial in the new variable @xmath150 . the next proposition is a simple application of lemmas [ laurent ] and [ change ] , and it relates eigenvectors and jordan chains of the two polynomials :    when @xmath223 , the jordan structure of @xmath222 at the eigenvalue @xmath224 is equal to the jordan structure of @xmath51 at either @xmath52 or @xmath148 . if @xmath156 , @xmath222 has a jordan chain of length @xmath27 at @xmath225 if and only if @xmath51 has a jordan chain of length @xmath30 at @xmath156 .",

    "albeit very attractive , from a numerical point of view this trick is not very suitable as soon as one considers a high degree polynomial .",
    "in fact , the matrix coefficients of @xmath222 need to be computed as linear combinations of the ones of @xmath51 .",
    "since the powers of a binomial are involved , the coefficients of these linear combinations would exponentially grow with the polynomial degree . to circumvent this difficulty , we shall make use of the dickson polynomials .",
    "the polynomial @xmath222 is readily expressed in terms of the @xmath226s since in the dickson basis the coefficients are just the old ones and therefore no computation at all is needed , namely , @xmath227 the associated linearization has several computational advantages with respect to other customary linearizations of @xmath51 .",
    "its size is @xmath228 versus @xmath229 , the spectral symmetries are preserved and , moreover , the linearization displays a semiseparable structure .",
    "more precisely , it is of the form @xmath230 where @xmath231 is identity plus low rank while @xmath232 is hermitian plus low rank .",
