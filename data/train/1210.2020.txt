    "nuclei are aggregates of protons and neutrons interacting through forces arising from the underlying theory of quantum chromodynamics .",
    "understanding how the strong force binds nucleons together in nuclei is fundamental to explain the very existence of the universe .",
    "indeed , the mutual interactions between nucleons led to the formation of the lightest nuclei a few minutes after the big bang , and the following nuclear processes , producing heavier nuclei during stellar evolution and in violent events like supernovae , have been crucial in shaping the world we leave in",
    ". therefore , one of the central goals of nuclear physics is to come to a basic understanding of the structure and dynamics of nuclei . the _ ab initio _",

    "applications of the ncsm / rgm approach to the description of nucleon- and deuteron - nucleus type of collisions based on two - nucleon ( @xmath31 ) realistic interactions have already led to very promising results  @xcite . in most instances , we employed similarity - renormalization - group ( srg )  @xcite evolved potentials , and in particular , those obtained from the chiral n@xmath0lo  @xcite @xmath31 interaction . here",
    "we briefly review two of such applications , the calculation of the @xmath32be@xmath33b radiative capture  @xcite , and the study of the @xmath0h@xmath34he and @xmath0he@xmath35he fusion reactions  @xcite .",
    "recently , we have performed the first _ ab initio _ many - body calculation of the @xmath32be@xmath33b radiative capture  @xcite , the final step in the nucleosynthetic chain leading to @xmath36b and one of the main inputs of the standard solar model .",
    "this calculation was carried out in a model space spanned by @xmath22-@xmath32be channel states including the five lowest eigenstates of @xmath32be ( the @xmath37 ground and the @xmath38,@xmath39 , and first and second @xmath40 excited states ) in an @xmath41 ncsm basis , and employed the srg - n@xmath0lo @xmath31 interaction with @xmath42 @xmath43 , where @xmath44 denotes the srg evolution parameter  @xcite .",
    "we first solved eq .",
    "( [ rgmeq ] ) with bound - state boundary conditions to find the bound state of @xmath36b , and then with scattering boundary conditions to find the @xmath22-@xmath32be scattering wave functions .",
    "former and latter wave functions were later used to calculate the capture cross section , which , at solar energies , is dominated by non - resonant @xmath45 transitions from @xmath22-@xmath32be @xmath46- and @xmath47-waves into the weakly - bound ground state of @xmath36b .",
    "all stages of the calculation were based on the same ho frequency of @xmath48 mev , which minimizes the g.s .",

    "energy is very close to convergence as indicated by a fairly flat frequency dependence in the range @xmath49 mev , and the vicinity to the @xmath50 result obtained within the importance - truncated ncsm  @xcite . with the chosen value @xmath42 @xmath43 for the srg evolution of the n@xmath0lo @xmath31 interaction ,",
    "we obtain a single @xmath51 bound state for @xmath36b with a separation energy of 136 kev , which is quite close to the observed one ( 137 kev ) .",
    "this is very important for the description of the low - energy behavior of the @xmath32be@xmath33b astrophysical s - factor , known as @xmath52 .",
    "while for a complete _ ab initio _ calculation one should include also the three - nucleon ( @xmath53 ) interaction induced by the srg evolution of the @xmath31 potential as well as the srg - evolved attractive initial chiral @xmath53 force , we note that in the @xmath44-range @xmath54-@xmath55 @xmath43 , and , in very light nuclei , the former interaction is repulsive and the two contributions cancel each other to a good extent  @xcite .",
    "figure 1 compares the resulting @xmath52 astrophysical factor with several experimental data sets .",

    "@xcite , while somewhat underestimating the direct data of junghans _",
    "et al_.  @xcite .",
    "the resonance due to the @xmath56 capture , particularly evident in these and filippone s data and missing in our results , does not contribute to a theoretical calculation outside of the narrow @xmath36b @xmath57 resonance and is negligible at astrophysical energies  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath56 operator , for which any dependence upon two - body currents needs to be included explicitly , poses more uncertainties than the siegert s @xmath45 operator .",
    "in addition , the treatment of this operator within the ncsm / rgm approach is slightly complicated by the contributions coming from the core ( @xmath32be ) part of the wave function .",
    "nevertheless , we plan to calculate its contribution in the future .",
    "our calculated @xmath58 mev b is on the lower side , but consistent with the latest evaluation @xmath59(expt)@xmath60(theory )  @xcite .",
    "the 0.7 ev b uncertainty was estimated by studying the dependence of the s - factor on the harmonic oscillator ( ho ) basis size @xmath61 as well as the influence of higher - energy excited states of the @xmath32be target .",
    "more precisely , we performed calculations up to @xmath50 within the importance - truncation ncsm scheme  @xcite including ( due to computational limitations ) only the first three eigenstates of @xmath32be .",
    "the @xmath41 and @xmath62 s - factors are very close .",
    "in addition , the convergence in the number of @xmath32be states was explored by means of calculations including up to 8 @xmath32be eigenstates in a @xmath63 basis ( larger @xmath61 values are currently out of reach with more then five @xmath32be states ) .",
    "this last set of calculations is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : p7be2 ] , from which it appears that , apart from the two @xmath40 states , the only other state to have a significant impact on the @xmath52 is the second @xmath64 , the inclusion of which affects the separation energy and contributes somewhat to the flattening of the @xmath46-factor around @xmath65 mev . for these last set of calculations we used srg - n@xmath0lo interactions obtained with different @xmath44 values with the intent to match closely the experimental separation energy in each of the largest model spaces .",
    "based on this analysis , we conclude that the use of an @xmath41 ho model space is justified and the restriction to five @xmath32be eigenstates is quite reasonable .",
    "in the following we present the first _ ab initio _ many - body calculations of @xmath0h@xmath34he and @xmath0he@xmath35he fusion reactions  @xcite starting from the srg - n@xmath0lo @xmath31 interaction with @xmath66 @xmath43 , for which we reproduce the experimental @xmath67-value of both reactions within @xmath68 .",
    "these reactions have important implications first and foremost for fusion energy generation , but also for nuclear astrophysics , and atomic physics . indeed , the deuterium - tritium fusion is the easiest reaction to achieve on earth and is pursued by research facilities directed at reaching fusion power .",
    "both @xmath0h@xmath34he and @xmath0he@xmath35he affect the predictions of big bang nucleosynthesis for light - nucleus abundances .",
    "in addition , the deuterium-@xmath0he fusion is also an object of interest for atomic physics , due to the substantial electron - screening effects presented by this reaction .",
    "the model spaces adopted are characterized by ho model basis sizes up to @xmath69 with a frequency of @xmath70 mev and channel bases including @xmath71-@xmath72he ( @xmath22-@xmath72he ) , @xmath73-@xmath0h ( @xmath73-@xmath0he ) , @xmath74-@xmath0h ( @xmath74-@xmath0he ) and @xmath75-@xmath0h ( @xmath75-@xmath0he ) binary cluster states . here ,",
    "@xmath74 and @xmath75 denote @xmath76-@xmath77 and @xmath78 deuterium excited pseudostates , respectively , and the @xmath0h ( @xmath0he ) and @xmath72he nuclei are in their ground state .",
    "the results obtained for the @xmath0he@xmath35he s - factor are presented in figure  [ fig : d3he ] .",
    "the deuteron deformation and its virtual breakup , approximated by means of @xmath73 pseudostates , play a crucial role in reproducing the observed magnitude of the s - factor .",
    "convergence is reached for @xmath79 .",
    "the typical dependence upon the ho basis sizes adopted is illustrated by the @xmath0h@xmath34he results of fig .",
    "[ fig : d3h ] .",
    "the convergence is satisfactory and we expect that an @xmath80 calculation , which is currently out of reach , would not yield significantly different results . while the experimental position of the @xmath0he@xmath35he s - factor is reproduced within few tens of kev and we find an overall fair agreement with experiment ( if we exclude the region at very low energy , where the accelerator data are enhanced by laboratory electron screening ) , the @xmath0h@xmath34he s - factor is not described as well with @xmath66 @xmath43 . due to its very low activation energy ,",
    "the @xmath0h@xmath34he s - factor , particularly the position and height of its peak , is extremely sensitive to higher - order effects in the nuclear interaction , such as the @xmath53 force ( not yet included in the calculation ) and missing isospin - breaking effects in the integration kernels ( which are obtained in the isospin formalism ) . with a very small change in the value of the srg evolution parameter we can compensate for these missing higher - order effects in the interaction and reproduce the position of the @xmath0h@xmath34he s - factor .",
    "this led to the theoretical s - factor of fig .",
    "[ fig : d3h ] ( obtained for @xmath81 @xmath43 ) , that is in overall better agreement with data , although it presents a slightly narrower and somewhat overestimated peak .",
    "this calculation would suggest that some electron - screening enhancement could also be present in the @xmath0h@xmath34he measured s - factor below  10 kev c.m .",
    "however , these results can not be considered conclusive until more accurate calculations using a complete nuclear interaction ( that includes the @xmath53 force ) are performed .",
    "work in this direction is under way .",
    "here we outline some of our more recent efforts in the development of the ncsm / rgm approach , namely the progress toward the inclusion of the three - nucleon force into the formalism , and the treatment of three - body clusters and their dynamics .              in past applications for light - ion reactions , we omitted the @xmath53 interaction induced by the srg renormalization of the @xmath31 potential as well as the initial chiral @xmath53 force . by neglecting induced forces",
    ", we introduced a dependence on the srg parameter @xmath44 , which was then chosen so that the particle separation energies were well reproduced . for low - energy thermonuclear reactions , this is a dominant effect , and overall such a procedure led to ( never obtained before ) realistic results .",
    "a truly accurate _ ab initio _ description demands the inclusion of both induced and chiral @xmath53 interactions .",
    "while the inclusion of the @xmath53 force into the ncsm / rgm formalism is conceptually straightforward , in practice it poses major challenges having to deal with : 1 ) the large number of @xmath53 matrix elements , which makes it essential to work within the jt - coupled scheme ; and 2 ) the appearance of kernels depending on the three - body densities of the target already for nucleon - nucleus processes , which demands new efficient computing strategies for applications with @xmath22-shell targets to be possible .",
    "figures  [ fig : n4he-1 ] and [ fig : n4he-2 ] present initial results for @xmath72he@xmath82he scattering phase shifts with inclusion of the @xmath53 force .",
    "the use of srg - evolved interactions facilitates the convergence of the calculation within @xmath83 . at the same time ,",
    "[ fig : n4he-2 ] highlights the influence of induced and initial components of the @xmath53 force on the resonant phase shifts . the largest splitting between @xmath84 and @xmath85",
    "is found when both induced and chiral @xmath53 forces are included ( nn+nnn curve ) .",
    "it should be noticed that these results are still preliminary , as not all relevant excitations of the @xmath72he nucleus have been taken into account yet .",
    "in particular , the resonances are sensitive to the inclusion of the first six excited states of the @xmath72he  @xcite ( here only the g.s .",
    "is included ) .",
    "we will complete this study in the coming months .",
    "we have also obtained first results for the @xmath86he scattering phase shifts and the ground state of @xmath87li including both srg - induced and chiral @xmath53 forces .",
    "the model spaces adopted so far contain only the g.s . of the @xmath72he and @xmath73 nuclei within a @xmath88 ho basis size . while calculations for larger @xmath61 values and including pseudo - excited states of the deuteron ( fundamental to model the deformation and virtual breakup of this nucleus ) are under way , these preliminary results are already very promising .",
    "in particular , the inclusion of the @xmath53 force produces a change in position and splitting of the @xmath77 and @xmath78 scattering phase shifts , which were not well described in our former calculation with only the @xmath31 part of the srg interaction .",
    "the @xmath53 force has also the effect of increasing the binding energy of the @xmath87li nucleus .",
    "a proper description of borromean halo nuclei and three - body breakup reactions ( but also virtual breakup effects ) within the ncsm / rgm approach requires the inclusion of three - cluster channel states and the treatment of the three - body dynamics .",
