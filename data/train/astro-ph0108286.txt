    "this is the first paper in a series of three concerning the supercosmos sky survey ( hereafter sss ) programme .",
    "this ambitious project aims to digitise the sky in three colours  ( bri ) , one colour  ( r ) at two epochs , via automatic scans of sky atlas photographs .",
    "the source photographic material comes from schmidt telescopes , observations being taken during the second half of the twentieth century ( see later ) .",
    "ultimately we aim to digitise the entire sky , but due to the time required to do so data are being ` released ' to the community as they become available . the first release of data consisted of 5000  square degrees of the southern sky at high galactic latitude ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "this became known as the south galactic cap ( hereafter sgc ) survey .",
    "all three papers in this series make reference to data from the sgc survey , but are generally relevant to the sss as a whole .",
    "this paper ( paper  i ) is intended as a general introduction and user guide to the sss .",
    "paper  ii ( hambly , irwin & macgillivray  2001a ) describes image detection , parameterisation , classification and photometry while paper  iii ( hambly et al .",
    "2001b ) is concerned with astrometry .",
    "these latter two papers contain much technical information about the sss .",
    "this paper summarises that information and compares with similar data from other survey programmes .",
    "we also describe how to access the data and give examples of results from the sss .    astronomical photography , which revolutionised astronomy in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries , has a history almost as long as that of photography itself ( lankford  1984 and references therein ) . digitised photographic sky surveys revolutionised astronomy in the late twentieth century ; their evolution over the last few decades has been dictated by developments in microdensitometry and digital electronics ( e.g.  klingsmith  1984 ; macgillivray & thomson  1992 ) .",
    "of course , in the modern era the sky is being digitised directly , bypassing photography altogether .",
    "this brings many advantages , not the least of which are the ability to survey faster , deeper and at wavelengths other than the optical  e.g.the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , york et al .",
    "2000 ) and the two ",
    "micron all  sky survey ( 2mass , kleinmann et al .",
    "however , it must be emphasised that for time ",
    "dependent phenomena for example ( e.g.  object position and brightness ) photographic sky atlases represent a vast archive of invaluable measurements for _ billions _ of objects .",
    "this has been suitably demonstrated recently by the addition of astrographic catalogue measurements of the carte du ciel plates to tycho positions from the hipparcos mission ( urban , corbin & wycoff  1998 ; hg et al .",
    "2000 and references therein ) .",
    "this juxtaposition of century  old photographic astrometry with a state  of  the  art space  based mission has yielded stellar proper motions on an unprecedented scale : _ millions _ of objects have proper motions measured to a precision of 2.5  mas  yr@xmath1 .",
    "it was the development of the schmidt telescope in the 1930s that revolutionised wide ",
    "angle photographic surveys ( e.g.  cannon  1995 ) . along with developments in fast photographic emulsions , these enabled sky atlas production to faint limiting magnitudes .",
    "the 1.2 m palomar oschin , 1.0 m eso and 1.2 m uk schmidt telescopes have been systematically photographing the whole sky over the last half  century .",
    "photographs have been taken in the blue , red and near  infrared passbands , with both blue and red passbands having observations at two epochs per field . for a concise summary of these photographic survey programmes ,",
    "see morgan  ( 1995 ) . given the vast numbers ( @xmath2 ) of plates in these sky atlases , it is clear that it is only through digitisation that these surveys can be fully exploited .",
    "there are several major digitisation programmes completed or currently in progress .",
    "these projects consist of scanning various subsets of the available sky survey atlas photographs ( in some cases glass or film copies of the original schmidt photographs ) and release of various data to the community .",
    "the scope of the various projects and their emphasis is different in each case .",
    "we now consider each in turn :      the automatic plate measuring ( apm ) machine is a ` flying  spot ' microdensitometer with pixel size of @xmath3 m ( or 0.5  arcsec at the schmidt plate scale of @xmath4  arcsec  mm@xmath1 ) .",
    "for details concerning the apm hardware , see kibblewhite et al .",
    "( 1984 ) ; more information is also available at ` http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/~mike/casu/apm/apm.html ` .",
    "the apm facility has produced the apm northern sky catalogue ( irwin & mcmahon  1992 ) which is based on scans of the first epoch palomar ( poss  i )  o and  e glass copy atlases and covers the northern sky down to galactic latitudes @xmath5 .",
    "this programme is currently being extended into the southern hemisphere using the serc ",
    "j / ej and serc  er / aao  r surveys .",
    "the apm sky catalogues provide paired lists of blue and red objects with morphological parameters and image classification .",
    "currently , they do not include pixel data , object proper motions or any information in the near  infrared . for more details , see the web pages accessed via the above url .",
    "the automated plate scanner ( aps ) machine is described by pennington et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and is similar in design to the apm .",
    "this machine is also undertaking a scanning programme based on the poss ",
    "i glass copies , but supplemented by the corresponding second epoch red plates obtained for the luyten proper motion surveys ( e.g.  luyten  1979 and references therein ) and ultimately poss  ii .",
    "all 664 poss ",
    "i fields having galactic latitude @xmath6 have been included .",
    "the aps object catalogue database ( see ` http://aps.umn.edu/ ` ) is similar in content to that of the apm ; proper motions will additionally be available in the future .",
    "also , restricted numbers of plates have thresholded pixel data available online ( the pixel size of the aps scans is 0.8  arcsec ) .",
    "these thresholded images have all sky areas set to zero intensity . once again , no near  infrared data are available . for more information concerning the aps database ,",
    "see cornuelle et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "the cosmos machine ( e.g.  macgillivray & stobie  1984 ) , also a ` flying  spot ' microdensitometer , was a development of the original galaxy plate measuring machines ( e.g.  murray & nicholson  1975 ) .",
    "cosmos ceased operation in late 1993 and has now been superseded by supercosmos ( see section  [ scos ] ) .",
    "the older machine had pixel size 1.1  arcsec and undertook a single colour  ( b@xmath7 ) survey of the southern sky using the serc ",
    "j / ej atlas glass copies and uk schmidt ` short ' red ( sr ) originals at low galactic latitude .",
    "the resulting database , the cosmos / ukst catalogue of the southern sky , included all fields at or south of the equator and having galactic latitude @xmath8 ( j ) or @xmath9 ( sr ) .",

    "the object catalogue contains position , morphological , photometric and classification information for each object in one colour ( b@xmath7 or  r depending on galactic latitude ) .",
    "no pixel data , proper motions or near  infrared data are available .      probably the greatest in scope of all the digitisation programmes is the digitised sky survey at the space telescope science institute ( lasker  1992 ) .",
    "this project was originally set up to provide guide stars for use with the hubble space telescope ( jenker , russell & lasker  1988 ) .",
    "two modified pds machines ( known as guide star automatic measuring machines , or gammas ) were constructed for the purpose of scanning the photographic material , and the first generation scanning programme was implemented with 1.7  arcsec pixels .",
    "the surveys scanned consisted of the serc ",

    "1990 ; russell et al .",
    "1990 ; jenker et al .",
    "1990 ) has since proven to be a major astronomical resource , far beyond its original goal of supporting hst operations .",
    "in addition , it was quickly realised that there was a large demand for the pixel data from the gsc ",
    "i scans , and the dss has also become a major astronomical resource ( for more information and online database access , see ` http://archive.stsci.edu/dss/ ` ) . the volume of raw pixel data in the dss ",
    "i necessitated the use of image compression techniques in order to make distribution possible ( see section  [ hcomp ] ) .",
    "the second generation survey ( dss ",
    "ii ) is now nearly complete .",
    "this includes modified scanning hardware ( the major change from dss ",
    "i is that the pixel size is now 1  arcsec ) and the addition of multiple colours and epochs from the poss  ii material in the northern hemisphere , and serc ",
    "i / serc  er / aao  r material in the south .",
    "a number of survey databases are in production .",
    "the second generation guide star catalogue ( gsc  ii ) is under construction ( mclean et al .",
    "1997 ) and will include  bri colours as well as proper motion information , for all objects down to m  @xmath10 .",
    "this catalogue is envisaged as being important for supporting various ground and space  based instruments ( e.g.  lasker et al .",
    "compressed pixel data in the r band are being made available online at the above url to supplement that available from dss ",
    "moreover , the palomar  stsci digital sky survey ( dposs ) is a project to archive and analyse the raw pixel data in each of the three colours ( bri ) to the plate limits in every poss  ii survey field ( e.g.  weir  1995 and references therein ; djorgovski et al .",
    "once complete , the three  colour northern sky catalogue is expected to be released to the astronomical community .",
    "the precision measuring machine ( pmm ) programme is operated at the united states naval observatory ( usno ) .",

    "note that , in some cases , glass or film copies have been scanned as opposed to glass originals ; note also that some fields have a recent non  atlas plate or glass copy plate of the original atlas plate substituted where the original was unmeasurable ( e.g.  because of severe degradation due to ` microspots '  see morgan  1995 ) .",
    "all of the scanning programmes listed in section  [ intro ] have made use of copy material for some areas / passbands .",

    "( 170,200 )      each digitised schmidt plate produces @xmath30  gbyte of 10  @xmath31 m ( @xmath32  arcsec ) pixel data ( paper  ii ) .",

    "note that sss object catalogue data are derived from the _ raw _ pixel data before these are archived to tape for offline storage ; however white et al .",
    "( 1992 ) demonstrate the effect of image compression on astrometric and photometric performance .",
    "furthermore , in figure  [ nmcomp ] ( see section  [ mmcomp ] later ) we show how image detection performs relative to uncompressed data as a function of compression factor to show quantitatively the effects of using h  compress . clearly , there is no loss in ` depth ' as measured by this test even for the relatively high compression factor of @xmath34 .",
    "pixel data extracted from the sss database are currently provided in density units ( paper  ii , equation  1 ) arbitrarily scaled to maximise use of the range of 16bit integers per pixel .",
    "no photometric calibration is provided with the images since the dynamic range of the data are image  morphology dependent , and generally limited to around a factor @xmath35 in density ( e.g.  hambly et al .",
    "1998 ) which corresponds to a factor of @xmath36 in incident intensity ; however approximate relative intensities for pixel values are given by @xmath37 where the exponent  0.4 takes into account the specularity of the supercosmos imaging optics .",
    "each image extracted from the database is output in standard flexible image transport system format ( see ` http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/heasarc/fits.html ` ) with comprehensive fits header information giving details of the source photographic material , measurement and astrometric calibration .",
    "additionally , fits world co - ordinate system keywords describing the local astrometry are included ( see paper  iii ) .",
    "each image extracted from the database also comes with an associated object catalogue so that the image data can be examined in conjunction with the detected sources in that area ( e.g.  by using gaia / skycat , draper  1999 ) .",
    "two object lists are attached as binary table extensions to the image .",
    "the first table consists of the ` most useful ' subset of all the image parameters available from the field / colour in question along with proper motion and colour information from other colours of the same field ; the second table gives the remainder of the full 32 parameters set for each image from the plate of the specified colour .",
    "the equinox of the co - ordinates in object catalogues associated with images is always j2000.0 while the epoch is always that of the plate from which the positions are derived ( as given in the fits image header ) .",
    "presently , images up to 30  arcmin in size can be extracted online . given an input position , the access software determines from which field the best image can be obtained ( taking into account field overlaps and proximity to respective field centres ) .",
    "image detection and parameterisation are described in paper  ii .",
    "each individual plate s pixel dataset has a raw object catalogue associated with it ; each detected image has 32  parameters describing such quantities as position , brightness , morphology and image class .",
    "photometric calibration is described in paper  ii while astrometric calibration is described in paper  iii .",
    "object catalogue formats currently supported in the sss are ascii ( i.e.  plain text , the most human  readable format ) , the so  called tab  separated table ( tst , davenhall  2000 and references therein ) and fits binary table extensions .",
    "paper  ii gives details of the internal storage units for object catalogue data ( table  1 , section  2.1.4 ) . at access time",
    ", data are translated into more conventional units depending on which type of output file is being written .",
    "note that for the tst and fits formats , browsers and manipulation software may translate units internally for display purposes ( for example , sss fits binary tables use double  precision floating point numbers in units of radians for celestial co - ordinates , and these will often be translated into sexagesimal for display ) .",
    "ascii format object catalogues ( e.g.  figure  [ ltable ] ) consist of object lists with sexagesimal celestial co - ordinates at the equinox / epoch specified by the user ; proper motion measures and error estimates in units of mas  yr@xmath1 ( defaulting to @xmath38 if no measurement is available ) ; br@xmath39r@xmath40i magnitudes in the natural photographic systems ( described , for example , in bessell  1986 and evans  1989 and references therein ) , defaulting to 99.999 when no measurement is available in any particular colour ; morphological data from the master plate , including semi  major and semi  minor ellipse  fit axes in mas , celestial position angle in degrees , classification flag ( 1=non  stellar , 2=stellar , 3=unclassifiable and 4=noise ) and profile classification statistic in units of sigma from an ideal stellar image ( see paper  ii , section  2.2.3 ) ; image blending and quality information ; and finally a field number of origin .",
    "tst files give the same information , but the units for the celestial co - ordinates are decimal degrees , as required by the tst standard .",
    "furthermore , the ellipse  fit axes are given in units of 10  @xmath31 m pixels , where 10  @xmath41  arcsec . fits tables again give the same information , but celestial co - ordinates are stored in units of radians .",
    "( 170,220 )      the online server giving access to the sss data provides a number of options for object catalogue generation . these fall into the two broad categories of basic options , and those of a more advanced or expert nature .",
    "basic user options consist of : search centre and equinox ; primary ( or ` master ' ) survey waveband , size of extracted area ( rectangular or circular ) ; primary magnitude range ; output equinox ; output epoch ( celestial co - ordinates can be proper motion corrected to a given epoch , or alternatively left at the epoch of observation ) ; and finally output format ( ascii , tst or fits ) .",
    "more advanced options ( which default to sensible values for general queries ) are : i ) an option to purge or keep duplicate image in overlap regions ; ii ) subset of parameters or all  32 per object ; iii ) a blending option allowing one of four choices in the presence of blended images ; and iv ) an image quality threshold .",
    "the image analyser ( described in paper  ii ) flags images according to detection of multiple components and various quality issues .",
    "the blend flag can be used to discard ` parent ' images of multiple components ( i.e.  the single image comprising the components ) or alternatively the component ( ` child ' ) images may be discarded .",
    "the other two choices available are to keep _ all _ images ( i.e.  parents and children ) or to keep only unblended images .",
    "if completeness is not an issue , then a clean catalogue of isolated , well defined images can be obtained using this last option .",
    "the quality bit flags are described in paper  ii , table  2 and a given quality threshold can be specified to discard images , since in general the more significant quality bits indicate more severe quality issues .",
    "for example , once again if completeness near bright stars is not an issue , a quality threshold of  1023 will reject all objects near a bright star as described in paper  ii , section  2.2.2 . since bit  10 in the quality flag is used to signify proximity to a bright star , and @xmath42 , then any object having quality @xmath43 is not affected by this particular quality issue ",
    "i.e.  is not near a bright star .",
    "conversely , a quality threshold of  2047 would _ include _ all those objects ( and a good many spurious images due to diffraction spikes and low ",
    "level scattered light halos as well ) .",
    "the lower the quality threshold , the more strict the quality assurance is .",
    "note that both blend and quality options are applied to every plate in creating the object catalogue ( i.e.  if other colours are available in addition to the primary colour , then the quality and blend tests are applied to their parameters also ) .",
    "all other selection options are applied to just the primary .",
    "finally , the advanced options also include a pairing proximity choice of either  3 or 6  arcsec ( the latter allows investigation of possible high proper motion objects ",
    "paper  iii , section  2.2.1 ) and a colour correction option allowing the switching on / off of correction of systematic errors as a function of position / magnitude ( paper  ii , section  2.3.4 ) .",
    "the modern schmidt atlas surveys have varying degrees of overlap between adjacent fields .",
    "also , the sss is an on  going project requiring several years to complete the photography and scanning and , if data are to be made generally available as soon as possible , some data will be unavailable in specific areas .",
    "moreover , paired information ( i.e.  colours and proper motions ) are not always available if , for example , an image appears in one passband only . for all these reasons ,",
    "a decision has to be made as to what to do in the case that more than one set of records , or no records at all , are available for given images or areas .    for the case of duplicate images in overlap regions the sss database access software uses proximity to respective plate centres combined with quality information to decide which image to keep in the case that duplicates exist .",
    "briefly , out of the list of duplicates available ( which can be up to four in the extreme field corners ) , any having quality indicating proximity to a plate label or wedge ( paper  ii , section  2.2.2 ) are discarded and then the object nearest the respective field centre is chosen as the ` best ' image .",
    "note that ` parent ' images are unpaired in the database and will not be purged in overlap regions if selected .    for situations where paired information is not available (",
    "because the required data have not yet been included in the database , or because no image pairs with other colours exist ) then null values are output for proper motions and colours .",
    "these are @xmath44 for proper motion components and errors and @xmath45 for magnitudes . of course",
    ", in the case that no primary image records are available in a requested area , then nothing will appear in the extracted object catalogue dataset .",
    "for a quantitative comparison of the stsci and supercosmos pixel data products , a @xmath46  arcmin region in eso / serc field  411 ( i.e. at the south galactic pole ) was chosen for test purposes . first",
    "( j ) and second ( r ) generation dss data were retreived from the stsci data server .",
    "these data are compressed by a factor @xmath36 to facilitate on  line storage at stsci ; the supercosmos data were compressed using h  compress ( white et al .",
    "1992 ) by factors of  10 and  20 to compare directly with dss data and also to show the effects of using higher compression factors . in order to assess quantitatively and objectively the information content of the images",
    ", the data were run through pisa ( draper & eaton  1999 ) which is an isophotal pixel analysis package similar to the cosmos image analyser ( beard , macgillivray & thanisch  1990 ) that both roe and stsci use to generate object catalogues ( note of course that both groups provide object catalogues derived from uncompressed data ; running decompressed images through object detection software is done here for illustrative purposes only ) .",
    "the data were thresholded ( in density space ) at @xmath47 above the mean sky level ( paper  ii , section 2.1.4 ) and a minimum of 6  pixels was required to define an image in all cases .",
    "note that this minimum pixel area cut was kept the same for the tests despite the fact that the stsci data have larger pixel sizes ( @xmath48 m and @xmath49 m for first and second generation data respectively ) , since reducing the cut for the coarser sampled data to an area equivalent to that of the higher resolution supercosmos data results in large numbers of spurious noise images being detected  it is fair to say that the fact that the supercosmos data has higher spatial resolution allows fainter detection limits , and this should be reflected in any test .",
    "figure  [ nmcomp ] shows the results of the image detection tests when compared against a ccd image of the same field which reaches much fainter limits than the photographs . from the plots",
    ", it can be seen immediately that the supercosmos pixel data are superior ( in this test , they reach @xmath50  mag deeper ) than the dss  i data , while the dss  ii and supercosmos data are broadly similar . interestingly",
    "( and counter  intuitively ) , the image detection is deeper for higher compression factors .",

    "the calibrations converge so systematic errors in photometry from incorrect classification will be negligible . however , for bright images , incorrect classification ( e.g.  because of deblending errors ) can produce incorrect magnitude calibration .      in paper",
    "iii we show that the positional absolute astrometric accuracy is limited by field position dependent systematic errors for most images , resulting in errors with respect to the icrf of typically @xmath127  arcsec with some dependence on passband and field position",
    ". a very small number of very low galactic latitude  b@xmath7 and  r plates have absolute positional errors up to @xmath128 worse than this due to extreme crowding of the tycho2 astrometric standards . such fields may be identified by examining the fits headers for extracted images . two keywords ( ` astsigx ` and ` astsigy ` ) are written with the wcs keywards which give the average residual of the tycho2 standards used in the global field astrometric solution ( see paper  iii ) ; these figures may be taken as an indication of the likely level of any systematic errors within the field in such cases .",
    "note that on scales of @xmath12 or less , and provided a field boundary is not being crossed , the systematic errors are constant so relative accuracy is typically better than 0.1  arcsec .",

    "the question of noise detections at the plate limit is as yet unmeasured and is difficult to quantify theoretically .",
    "although images are rigorously required to have 8 connected pixels with intensities @xmath133 above local sky ( paper  ii ) , the pixel  to  pixel noise is correlated to varying degrees in the image data . all that can be said here",
    "is that not every faint image will be real , and if clean and reliable datasets are required then it is advisable to use datasets paired between two or more colours when using sss data . in any case , great care should be taken when using data within @xmath50  mag of the respective plate limits .",

    "( 160,80 )    briefly , deblending can only take place when rethresholding detects the fragmentation of an image ; when a faint image is deblended from a bright image , object parameterisation ( particularly the second moments ) for the faint image can be badly affected . if completeness is not an important issue , then it is of course possible to use the deblending flag to choose only isolated images ( e.g.  section  [ options ] ) .",

    "( 1990 ) demonstrates the relative completeness as a function of image density when deblending is / is not employed . at object densities of @xmath24  arcmin@xmath136 ( corresponding to @xmath137 for example )",
    "completeness is @xmath138% without deblending whereas it is @xmath139% when deblended images are used .    for bright galaxy work , it is important to note that the image deblending algorithm tends to ` break up ' such extended , structured images . in figure  [ gblend ]",
    "we show an example for the cartwheel galaxy ( @xmath140 )",

    "( 160,70 )      again , paper  ii quantifies the reliability of image classification with respect to external datasets  a typical figure is @xmath130% reliability of correct classification to b@xmath132 .",
    "however , it is important to note that two classification parameters are available for each image in each passband in sss data : the discrete classification code or flag , and the normalised profile classification statistic @xmath142 .",
    "the discrete code is defined as 4 ( noise ) for @xmath143 , stellar for @xmath144 and non  stellar for @xmath145 .",
    "hence , the classification flag is conservative in the sense of defining a clean but incomplete stellar sample",
    ". some applications may require a less strict cut on image class ( or a more strict cut on non  stellar class ) , in which case it may be advisable to use @xmath142 as opposed to the flag to define , for example , a stellar selection having @xmath146 .",
    "this is equivalent to a k ",
    "sigma cut on the classification statistic , with corresponding confidence levels on stellar completeness assuming @xmath142 is normally distributed for stars .",
    "finally , we address the issue of image defects and spurious objects . as stated before , the combination of the photographic emulsion , digitisation and subsequent supercosmos pixel analysis is by no means a perfect imaging system .",
    "the following defects may be present in sss data ( more description of some of these may be found in tritton  1983 ) :      figure  [ spots ] shows some examples of image data containing microspots , or emulsion flaws which appear over time on stored photographic material .",
    "these include classic ` gold spot ' , ` gold rings ' and ` yellow spots ' .",
    "many of these flaws tend to be associated with higher density regions in the developed emulsion ( e.g.  around bright stars ) and nearer the edges of the photographs . where spotting was severe over large areas of the original atlas plates we have substituted a copy plate ( made soon after the original was taken and developed )  see table  [ atlases ] .",
    "hence , the online digital data may differ from previously issued film atlases for example .",
    "note that in the interests of a uniform survey we have limited substitution of originals by copies , and note also that where any spotting is present at the edges of fields , the adjacent plate overlap object data are generally available .",
    "moreover , as shown in figure  [ spots ] , because microspots for the most part tend to produce higher transmission values than the sky level ( i.e.  apparent emulsion ` holes ' ) they do not give rise to spurious object detections .",
    "however , one effect that has been noticed in the data is that bright images affected by ` gold rings ' tend to be flagged as noise images by the image classifier , so in the very rare instances that microspots are present , image parameters may be affected .",
    "( 160,70 )      as an inevitable consequence of long exposures over wide angles in the modern age , many satellite trails are present on schmidt atlas photographs .",
    "moreover , trails resulting from meteors and other atmospheric phenomena can be present . under pixel analysis",
    ", trails tend to fragment into a series of faint , elliptical images classed as galaxies .",
    "the easiest way to eliminate such spurious detections from an sss catalogue is to use a paired dataset  for example , brown et al .",
    "( 2001 ) used a b@xmath7/r paired galaxy catalogue ( i.e.  a galaxy catalogue made by using the b@xmath7 plates as the master but in subsequent analysis only images with a corresponding r magnitude were used ) despite the fact that the statistics were computed from the b@xmath7 data alone . for stellar work ,",
    "an ellipticity cut can go a long way to eliminating spurious objects resulting from trails ( as well as those from other sources ",
    "e.g.  see the next section ) .      in figure  [ bright](a ) and",
    "( b ) we show b@xmath7 image data in the vicinity of a bright ( m  @xmath36 ) star along with and ellipse plot of the raw image catalogue from those data .",

    "clearly , there are advantages and disadvantages to each of these methods . for example",
    ", using the quality flag to ` drill ' around bright stars is conservative in that _ all _ images ( including real ones ) are expunged from the circular region , while the ellipticity cut necessarily removes real galaxy images that are elliptical .",
