    "spin diffusion is one of the basic transport processes which tends to compensate an imbalance of magnetization between regions of a sample .",
    "it has been studied , e.g. , in liquid helium @xcite , spintronics @xcite , and recently in ultracold atomic gases @xcite .",
    "if one writes the local magnetization vector as @xmath6 , the magnetization gradient @xmath7 has two contributions : longitudinal diffusion acts between regions of different magnitude of magnetization @xmath8 , i.e. , different polarization .",
    "second , transverse spin diffusion arises for spins of the same magnitude @xmath8 but different orientation @xmath9 , and determines the damping of transverse spin waves .",
    "the diffusivities associated with both channels have equal magnitude at high temperatures in the nondegenerate regime ( boltzmann limit ) , as well as for an unpolarized gas .",
    "however , they differ for the most interesting case of a polarized gas at low temperature in the quantum degenerate regime , since different scattering processes are responsible for the two channels .",
    "while the longitudinal spin diffusivity @xmath0 grows as @xmath10 for a fermi liquid at low temperature @xmath11 due to pauli blocking , the transverse spin diffusivity @xmath1 is much lower  corresponding to larger spin drag  and reaches a constant value as @xmath2 in the normal phase , i.e. , in the absence of a phase transition .",
    "experiments in dilute solutions of @xmath12he in liquid @xmath13he can be understood essentially within kinetic theory and the born approximation for weakly interacting quasiparticles .",
    "kinetic equations for transverse spin transport were derived by landau and silin @xcite and applied to degenerate and/or polarized gases @xcite .",
    "transverse diffusion is influenced by the spin - rotation effect by which the spin current precesses around the molecular field of a polarized gas @xcite ; a similar effect of identical particle spin rotation occurs when two scattering spins rotate around the common axis given by the sum of the two spins @xcite .",
    "still , in dilute solutions of @xmath12he strong magnetic fields are required to reach a fully polarized state .",
    "the advent of ultracold atomic gases @xcite provides new experimental opportunities : one can selectively drive radiofrequency transitions between atomic hyperfine levels and coherently control the population of different `` spin '' states . in this way , both longitudinal @xcite and transverse @xcite spin transport have recently been measured .",
    "crucially , in ultracold atomic gases the scattering length can be tuned to become much larger than the particle spacing . in such strongly interacting fermi gases",
    "new transport phenomena arise , for instance , almost perfect fluidity @xcite , where the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density @xmath14 is bounded from below by quantum mechanics . the related question of whether quantum mechanics provides a bound @xmath15 for spin diffusion has recently been studied in the normal fermi liquid phase for longitudinal @xcite and transverse @xcite spin diffusion ; a sum rule for the spin conductivity is derived in @xcite . in current experiments interactions",
