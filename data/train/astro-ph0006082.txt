    "in a recent paper prochaska & wolfe ( 2000 ) reported new data on [ fe / h ] for damped ly@xmath1 systems at high redshifts .",
    "they also summarized available data with redshifts from @xmath6 to 4.5 ( e.g. , lu et al .",
    "1996 ; lu , sargent , & barlow 1997 ; prochaska & wolfe 1999 ) .",
    "their observations are in general accord with previous studies and expand the database at @xmath10 substantially .",
    "prochaska & wolfe ( 2000 ) emphasized that there is a wide spread in [ fe / h ] at a given @xmath3 and no damped ly@xmath1 system has [ fe / h ]  @xmath11 ( see also lu et al .",
    "1996 , 1997 ) .",
    "they also pointed out that there is only a minimal growth of [ fe / h ] from @xmath12 to 1.5 . in a theoretical study of fe and @xmath0-process abundances in very metal - poor stars in the galaxy by wasserburg & qian ( 2000 , hereafter wq ) , it was proposed that the first stars formed after the big bang were very massive ( @xmath13 ) and promptly enriched the interstellar medium ( ism ) to [ fe / h ]  @xmath2 , at which metallicity formation of normal stars ( with masses @xmath14@xmath15 ) took over .",
    "subsequent fe enrichment was provided by a subset of type ii supernovae .",
    "the interpretations of wq were based on observations of metal - poor stars in the galaxy by gratton & sneden ( 1994 ) , mcwilliam et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , mcwilliam ( 1998 ) , and sneden et al .",
    "( 1996 , 1998 ) .",
    "the apparent agreement between the lower bound on [ fe / h ] of damped ly@xmath1 systems and the critical metallicity [ fe / h ]  @xmath2 deduced by wq for transition from formation of very massive stars to normal stars suggests that this fe enrichment model deserves further study .    here",
    "we present a phenomenological model for the range of [ fe / h ] at a given @xmath3 for damped ly@xmath1 systems based on the model of wq .",
    "it is assumed that formation of normal stars started in a damped ly@xmath1 system ( i.e. , a protogalactic system turned on ) at a time @xmath4 after the big bang .",
    "the assembly of [ fe / h ] at a given @xmath3 is interpreted as a sampling of @xmath4 ranging from 0 to the age of the universe at @xmath3 , @xmath16 .",
    "the value @xmath17 corresponds to the upper bound on [ fe / h ] .",
    "furthermore , the distribution of @xmath4 at a given @xmath3 indicates the rate of turn - on of protogalaxies prior to @xmath16 .",
    "the data near @xmath18 suggest that this rate was initially very low and slowly reached a maximum at @xmath9  gyr after the big bang .",
    "we describe the fe enrichment model in detail in  2 and apply it to explain the data on [ fe / h ] of damped ly@xmath1 systems in  3 .",
    "discussion and conclusions are given in  4 .",
    "the fe enrichment model of wq was developed to explain the relation between abundances of fe and @xmath0-process elements ( @xmath0-elements ) in metal - poor stars in the galaxy .",
    "meteoritic data on the inventory of radioactive @xmath19i and @xmath20hf in the early solar system require at least two distinct type ii supernova sources for the @xmath0-process ( wasserburg , busso , & gallino 1996 ; qian , vogel , & wasserburg 1998 ; qian & wasserburg 2000 ) .",
    "these are the high - frequency h events responsible for heavy @xmath0-elements with mass numbers @xmath21 ( e.g. , ba and eu ) and the low - frequency l events responsible for light @xmath0-elements with @xmath22 ( e.g. , ag ) .",
    "the recurrence timescales for the h and l events are @xmath23  yr and @xmath24  yr , as required by replenishment of the appropriate radioactive nuclei in a standard mixing mass ( @xmath25 the size of a molecular cloud ) for a supernova .",
    "additional evidence in support of different sources for the heavy and light @xmath0-elements has been found by sneden et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .    the observed wide dispersion in abundances of the heavy @xmath0-elements such as ba and eu over a narrow range of [ fe / h ]  @xmath2 to @xmath26 ( mcwilliam et al .",
    "1995 ; mcwilliam 1998 ; sneden et al .",
    "1996 , 1998 ) led wq to conclude that the h events can not produce a significant amount of fe .",
    "in contrast , there is a correlation between abundances of fe and the heavy @xmath0-elements at [ fe / h ]  @xmath27 ( gratton & sneden 1994 ; see also mcwilliam et al .",
    "1995 ) . as type ia supernovae would occur only at metallicities much higher than [ fe / h ]  @xmath28 , fe enrichment of very metal - poor stars with [ fe / h ]  @xmath27 must be provided by the l events .",
    "consequently , the l events are responsible for the part of fe contributed by type ii supernovae in general",
    ". there are @xmath29 l events during the time of @xmath30 prior to solar system formation .",
    "to provide @xmath31 of the solar fe inventory by these events , each l event must enrich a standard mixing mass with [ fe / h]@xmath32 .    the near absence of the heavy @xmath0-elements in stars with [ fe / h ]  @xmath33 to @xmath34 ( mcwilliam et al .",
    "1995 ; mcwilliam 1998 ) and the sharp increase in the abundances of such elements at [ fe / h ] @xmath2 to @xmath26 led wq to conclude that a source other than type ii supernovae must exist to produce fe ( along with other elements such as c , n , o , mg , and si ) at [ fe / h ]  @xmath35 .",
    "this source was attributed by wq to very massive stars ( with masses @xmath13 ) that first formed after the big bang .",
    "they further argued that formation of normal stars could not occur until [ fe / h ]  @xmath2 was reached .",
    "presumably , this critical metallicity corresponds to conditions in the ism that permit sufficient cooling and fragmentation to occur in collapsing gas clouds .",
    "a recent study by bromm , coppi , & larson ( 1999 ) suggests that the very first stars were rather massive .",
    "the products of very massive stars formed from big bang debris have been discussed earlier by ezer & cameron ( 1971 )",
    ". however , nucleosynthesis in such stars remains to be tested with adequate stellar models .",
    "to discuss [ fe / h ] of a damped ly@xmath1 system at a given @xmath3 , we assume the following history for its evolution : ( 1 ) at time @xmath36 after the big bang , matter consisting of big bang debris was isolated to form a system ; ( 2 ) prompt enrichment by the first very massive stars ended at time @xmath37 , resulting in [ fe / h ]  @xmath2 in the ism ; and ( 3 ) formation of normal stars began at time @xmath4 , with the l events providing further fe enrichment to an average ism at regular intervals .",
    "the above times are related as @xmath38 .",
    "as @xmath39 , it is necessary to define the value of @xmath16 that is used .",
    "we take the redshift @xmath3 to correspond to a time @xmath40 after the big bang .",
    "we take the hubble constant @xmath41 and the matter contribution to the critical density @xmath42 [ equation ( [ tz ] ) gives essentially the exact result for @xmath16 at @xmath43 for a flat universe with @xmath42 and a cosmological constant ] . by our assumption , for @xmath44 the metallicity of a damped ly@xmath1 system is at least [ fe / h ]  @xmath2 .",
    "prochaska & wolfe ( 2000 ) reported that no system at @xmath6 to 4.5 has [ fe / h ]  @xmath11 .",
    "this means that the time required to provide prompt fe enrichment must be less than @xmath45  gyr .",
    "the lower bound on [ fe / h ] due to prompt enrichment is shown as a band between @xmath34 and @xmath26 in figure 1 together with the data summarized in prochaska & wolfe ( 2000 ) .    in general ,",
    "for @xmath46 the metallicity of a specific damped ly@xmath1 system at @xmath3 is given by @xmath47 where the number ratio in round brackets ( fe / h ) is related to the standard square bracket notation by [ fe / h ]  @xmath48 , with ( fe / h)@xmath49 corresponding to the prompt enrichment and ( fe / h)@xmath50 to the contribution from a single l event to a standard reference mass of hydrogen .",
    "we take [ fe / h]@xmath51 , [ fe / h]@xmath52 , and @xmath53  yr , the same parameters used by wq . as recognized by lu et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , the scatter in [ fe / h ] at a given @xmath3 for damped ly@xmath1 systems might result from their different formation histories .",
    "equation ( [ fe ] ) explicitly states that the range of [ fe / h ] at @xmath3 is caused by the different start times @xmath4 for normal star formation in individual systems ( see figure 2a ) .",
    "the values for [ fe / h ] corresponding to @xmath54 and 1.5  gyr are shown in figure 1 .",
    "damped ly@xmath1 systems that just turned on at @xmath55 would have [ fe / h ]  @xmath56  [ fe / h]@xmath49 .",
    "an upper bound on [ fe / h ] exists as damped ly@xmath1 systems that turned on at @xmath57 would have the longest history of normal star formation , and hence , the highest [ fe / h ] .",
    "this bound is insensitive to the choice of [ fe / h]@xmath49 .",
    "it can be seen from figure 1 that almost all the data lie below the upper bound ( usually well below this bound ) .",
    "even the three exceptions are close to this bound ( see  4 ) .    at a fixed @xmath3 , equation ( [ fe ] ) with equation ( [ tz ] ) can be used to determine the start time @xmath4 for normal star formation in a damped ly@xmath1 system from its [ fe / h ] . in turn , a histogram of the number of systems at @xmath3 within a given [ fe / h ] interval determines the probability @xmath58 for normal star formation to start in the interval between @xmath4 and @xmath59 after the big bang . knowing the probability distribution @xmath60 over @xmath61 at @xmath3",
    ", we expect that the probability distribution at @xmath62 can be obtained by discarding the part of @xmath63 for @xmath64 and renormalizing the remaining part over @xmath65 ( see figure 2b ) . for the case of a simple power - law distribution @xmath66[t^\\star / t(z)]^\\alpha$ ] . in this case , the average start time for normal star formation in damped ly@xmath1 systems at @xmath3 is @xmath67t(z)$ ] .",
    "the data in figure 1 show a relatively high concentration in the interval @xmath68 .",
    "the average start time in this interval is @xmath69  gyr .",
    "the frequency of occurrences of @xmath4 calculated from the data in this interval is shown as a histogram in figure 3 .",
    "it can be seen that the frequency of occurrences is low for @xmath57 ( close to the big bang ) and slowly increases to a maximum at @xmath70  gyr . assuming a power - law distribution for @xmath71",
    ", we obtain @xmath72 , for which @xmath73 ( see the corresponding curve for [ fe / h ] shown in figure 1 ) .",
    "values of @xmath71 for all the data are shown in figure 4 .",
    "the clustering of @xmath71 close to @xmath16 indicates that typically there is a long delay between the big bang and the start time @xmath71 for normal star formation in damped ly@xmath1 systems .",
    "we consider the dominant cause of dispersion of [ fe / h ] at a given @xmath3 for damped ly@xmath1 systems to be the variation in the start time @xmath74 after the big bang for normal star formation in different protogalaxies .",
    "the bounds on [ fe / h ] from our model appear to closely define the observed ranges .",
    "the average @xmath4 for damped ly@xmath1 systems at @xmath3 is @xmath75 .",
    "the rate of turn - on of protogalaxies was initially very low and slowly increased to a maximum at @xmath9  gyr after the big bang .",
    "it is not possible to identify a turnover in this rate without more data at @xmath76 .",
    "we suggest that the approach outlined here is a method for dating the start time for normal star formation in protogalaxies . as the formation of quasars",
    "is closely related to star formation , we consider that the histogram shown in figure 3 may offer some insights into the rate of formation of quasars .",
    "for example , if the rate of quasar formation @xmath77 is proportional to the turn - on rate of protogalaxies , figure 3 suggests that @xmath78 at @xmath79 .",
    "this gives a decrease by a factor of 2.7 in @xmath77 from @xmath80 to 4 , consistent with the drop in quasar comoving space density at these redshifts ( schmidt , schneider , & gunn 1995 ) .",
    "the three data points that lie above the upper bound in figure 1 could be explained if the enrichment rate @xmath81 of l events were increased by a factor @xmath82 .",
    "it is possible that @xmath83 has a spread of a factor of 2 or 3 .",
    "alternatively , we can consider the enrichment rate as a steep function of time , with @xmath84 starting quite high and then settling down to the value proposed by wq . in this case",
    "( fe / h ) @xmath85  ( fe / h)@xmath86 and the straight line evolution in figure 2a would be replaced by a curve .",
    "we note that fe enrichment by type ia supernovae would not be significant for most damped ly@xmath1 systems as such enrichment appears to be significant only at [ fe / h ]  @xmath87 in the galaxy ( timmes , woosley , & weaver 1995 ) .",
    "a more difficult matter is the timescale for condensing protogalactic globs during the expansion of the universe and the timing sequence outlined above .",
    "the range in @xmath4 required is large and indicates that the time required to form protogalaxies and condense most of the baryonic matter into stars is comparable to the age of the universe at @xmath88 ( @xmath89 gyr after the big bang ) or possibly even longer .",
    "this is in conflict with ab initio models that report almost complete condensation of dark matter and possibly cloud or protogalaxy formation at @xmath9020 ( e.g. , kamionkowski , spergel , & sugiyama 1994 ) . the occurrence of [ fe / h ]  @xmath91 at @xmath92 implies that there are regions where formation of normal stars did not begin until @xmath93 gyr after the big bang .",
    "the occurrence of [ fe / h ]  @xmath91 to @xmath94 in the range of @xmath95 to 4.2 indicates that a large fraction of the baryonic matter has not been condensed into protogalaxies and stars over the corresponding extended time range .",
    "if damped ly@xmath1 systems are random samples of the original medium , this indicates that the reservoir of original uncondensed baryonic material may not have been seriously diminished over @xmath89  gyr .",
    "indeed , it is possible that the bulk of this baryonic matter is dispersed and has not condensed today . measurements of damped ly@xmath1 systems at lower redshifts ( but at times before type ia supernovae contribute fe ) would provide a test .",
    "we have no means of establishing a priori whether the intrinsic rate of protogalaxy formation decreases with time ( possibly due to decrease in global density ) without appreciably depleting the reservoir of baryonic matter .",
    "a variant of the above scenario is possible which would not be in conflict with the models that suggest almost complete condensation of baryonic matter by @xmath96 .",
    "the modified scenario would be that most baryonic matter in the potential well created by non - baryonic dark matter is rapidly collected into ur - protogalaxies , that formation of very massive stars from big bang debris is rapid [ @xmath97 , and that the explosion of these very massive stars destroys the ur - protogalaxies and redistributes matter into the general medium providing a uniform source of fe ( and other elements such as c , n , o , mg , and si ) .",
    "the material in this second generation medium is then the source for much slower aggregation and formation of protogalaxies and stars .",
    "the explosion of very massive stars is likely to be very energetic .",
    "the potential wells formed by dark matter are considered to have a typical escape velocity of @xmath98  km  s@xmath99 .",
    "the velocity of debris ejected from explosion of very massive stars is almost certainly much larger than this value .",
    "the inter - protogalactic medium would then be supplied with hot matter containing fe , mg , o , si , and c. a hint in favor of this is found in the recent detection of o vi quasar absorption systems at low redshifts ( tripp , savage , & jenkins 2000 ) .",
    "knowledge of the explosion dynamics and nucleosynthetic products of very massive stars formed from big bang debris is fundamental to further progress .",
    "we want to thank roger blandford and marc kamionkowski for their ongoing interest in this work and for generously giving their time and providing , as usual , deep cosmic insights and education .",
    "sir maarten schmidt has been kind enough to expose us to the details of quasar distribution .",
