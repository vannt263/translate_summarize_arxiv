    "cp violation in the @xmath12 meson decay processes @xmath13 is highly suppressed in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "given its small sm expectation , cp violation in @xmath12 meson decay play important role to probe models beyond sm ( see , for example @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "recently , the lhcb collaboration has reported a measurement of difference in cp asymmetry , @xmath1 based on the data of 580  pb@xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the measured difference in cp asymmetry , a_cp = [ -0.820.21()0.11()]% which corresponds to the sm prediction of @xmath15 . the deviation from the sm prediction is then 3.5  @xmath16 evidence .",
    "the cpv in @xmath13 arises from the interference between tree level amplitude of sm charged current and the qcd penguin amplitude . as a result of gim - mechanism @xcite ,",
    "the qcd penguin amplitude completely vanish at the limit when internal quarks in penguins are massless . within the sm framework , non - zero contribution to direct",
    "cp violation comes only from the bottom quark which is proportional to @xmath17 .",
    "the ckm factor here is very small , suppressed by @xmath18 . with additional loop factor suppression ,",
    "the cp violation in @xmath13 is typically of @xmath19 in short distance calculation .",
    "it is unlikely that nonpertubative effects may enhance the direct cp violation to be above @xmath20 .",
    "the recent measure of difference in @xmath21 and @xmath22 basically minimize the effect from indirect cp violation , namely cp violation in the @xmath11 mixing .",
    "the significant @xmath23 clearly indicates that the observed cp violation should occur in the @xmath13 decay directly . to solve the anomaly , new physics",
    "is required to enhance the cp violation in @xmath13 decay @xcite .",
    "one simple extension of sm is to introduce a fourth family of quarks and leptons , the fourth generation down quark @xmath24 of 400  gev can enhance the penguin amplitude by @xmath25 in mass squared but with suppression from quark mixing .",
    "the cabibbo - koboyashi - maskawa quark mixing matrix ( ckm ) of fourth family is constrained by precision electroweak tests , for instance @xmath26-parameter and the @xmath27-mixing of @xmath28 is allowed @xcite .",
    "we estimate the suppression from quark mixing of ckm4 is about @xmath29 and the penguin amplitude is then enhanced by @xmath30 from the fourth generation @xmath24 contribution .",
    "it does provide possible parameter space to accommodate the about @xmath31 cp violation . at the same time , the contribution to the @xmath11 mixing is under control with additional ckm suppression .",
    "however , in this paper , we would like to focus on the other possibility involving top quark .",
    "top quark contribution is gim violation . as the heaviest known particle that gets its mass via electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) ,",
    "top quarks couples to the longitudinal polarized @xmath32 state strongly and leads to the enhancement as @xmath33 in the sm penguin of @xmath34 transition . on the other hand , in many new physics models",
    ", top quark very often appears in @xmath35 transition and the @xmath36 decay like @xmath13 is very sensitive to such models .",
    "more interestingly , since top quarks decay before hadronization and can be directly measured at detectors , if the new physics involves top quarks , both @xmath36 and @xmath37 can also be tested at the collider directly . @xmath7 and @xmath38 ( or @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) .",
    "a recent anomaly observed at the tevatron basically motivated most of such models of @xmath35 transition involving the top quarks .",
    "cdf collaboration at tevatron in this january reported the reconstructed top quark forward - backward asymmetry in the semi - leptonic @xmath41 system .",
    "the most significant deviation appears in the @xmath41 sample with large @xmath41 invariant mass @xmath42 while the others are mostly within 2  @xmath16 . for @xmath43 ,",
    "the forward - backward asymmetry for reconstructed top quark measured in the @xmath41 rest frame is a^t|t_fb(m_t|t > 450  ) = 0.4750.112  .",
    "the measurement corresponds to the sm prediction @xmath44 @xcite which includes both qcd @xmath45 and electroweak @xmath46 corrections .",
    "again , this deviation appears as over 3  @xmath16 .",
    "the unfolded d@xmath47 measurement of @xmath48 which is within 1  @xmath16 of sm prediction@xcite . ] since the other measurements in @xmath41 like total production rate @xmath49 are in good agreement with the sm predictions , the proposals to solve the large @xmath50 all require destructive interference between the new physics and the sm @xmath51 , @xmath52 .",
    "in addition , since the anomaly corresponds to a large @xmath42 region , the @xmath53-channel proposal @xcite which maximize the asymmetry at rutherford singularity @xmath54 match the basic feature of the measurement . among the proposals , @xmath53-channel",
    "neutral current process interferes with the largest sm mode @xmath55 and spin - correlation also maximize the positive forward - backward asymmetry @xcite .",
    "however , in order to explain the top quark forward - backward asymmetry puzzle , only significant @xmath9 coupling is required and this is not sufficient to generate the @xmath35 transition . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the possibility of generating @xmath35 transition mediated by the top quark penguin .",
    "not surprisingly , the most stringent constraint would come from @xmath11 mixing . unlike the qcd penguin , @xmath11 mixing in the sm is dominated by the strange quark contribution . at amplitude level ,",
    "the bottom quark contribution in the box diagram is suppressed by a factor of @xmath56 while the corresponding strange quark contribution is only @xmath57 suppression but the mass dependence is still quadratic as @xmath58 .    in the next section ,",
    "we discuss the model setup .",
    "then we study the model parameter space required by the @xmath0 measurement in the third section . in section iv ,",
    "various constraints of the model are discussed , in both low energy physics like @xmath59 and collider experiments like same - sign top quark , inclusive @xmath41 search .",
    "we then conclude in the final section .",
    "in order to achieve large @xmath35 transition induced by top quark penguin , the new gauge interaction must couple to both @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "flavor changing interactions in the sm can only be measured via electroweak charged current interactions . for the sm fermion rotation matrixes ,",
    "the left - handed ones get constrained from the ckm matrix @xmath62 but only the product instead of the @xmath63 and @xmath64 respectively .",
    "the rotations for the right - handed states are then completely unknown and this gives large degree of freedom .",
    "we first study an abelian model , a @xmath65 gauge symmetry under which only right - handed up - type quarks transform . with only the sm particle contents",
    ", the @xmath65 is anomalous so we expect a uv completion theory .",
    "presumably a much larger gauge group is broken at very high energy and only a @xmath65 survive to low energy and is broken around tev scale . in this paper , we do nt discuss the detail of the uv theory .",
    "instead , we concentrate on the low energy theory of the electroweak scale @xmath65 gauge boson interacting with the sm fermions .    in the flavor basis of @xmath66",
    ", @xmath65 is @xmath67 which shows only @xmath9 couples to the @xmath68 .",
    "as discussed earlier , there also exists degree of freedom of right - handed up quark rotation .",
    "we take a special choice of the rotation @xmath69 to illustrate the feature . @xmath70",
    "the cp violating phase @xmath71 can be easily included into the above rotation .",
    "the effective lagrangian is then z^ _",
    "( |t_r^ u_r c_+ |t_r^ c_r s _ ) where @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 is the coupling constant of the @xmath65 .    if the particle @xmath68 is completely neutral which enable @xmath68 to couple @xmath75 , @xmath76 at the same time .",
    "both @xmath77 and @xmath78 exist and the first one dominates at the @xmath79 collisions at tevatron while the second one dominates at the large hadron collider(lhc ) .",
    "given its huge @xmath80-valence quark flux at the @xmath81 collider lhc , even with 7  tev total energy , the @xmath68 receives severe constrain from direct search of @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "to resolve the same - sign top puzzle , non - abelian horizontal gauge symmetry models are proposed in @xcite . in principle , a non - abelian model where @xmath83 form a doublet under a @xmath84 and can avoid large same - sign top quark production and box contribution to @xmath11 mixing .",
    "however , the rotation to give @xmath10 couplings will generate large @xmath85-mixing mediated by the @xmath86 . @xmath87 and @xmath88 are nearly degenerate at the @xmath84 limit",
    ". then the tree level @xmath11 mixing is inevitable .",
    "the parameter space that generates the @xmath0 will correspond to unacceptable @xmath11 mixing .",
    "for singly cabibbo suppressed ( scs ) d decays , the sm penguin contributions can be safely neglected , as they are highly suppressed by the ckm factor @xmath89 , the gim suppression @xmath90 and the loop factors ( see , for example @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however the @xmath91-induced fcnc is only loop suppressed , which may provide large enough cp violation effects to account for the lhcb measurement .",

    "for order - of - magnitude estimation for @xmath101 , @xmath102 decays , we use naive factorization with the wilson coefficients at leading order .",
    "the magnitude of direct cp violation is determined by the ratio of new physics amplitude over the sm amplitude @xmath103 where @xmath104 in the su(3 ) flavor limit with @xmath105 .",
    "@xmath106,@xmath107 and @xmath108 in the naive factorization .",

    "the wilson coefficients at the scale @xmath114 can then be evaluated as @xmath115 with the expression of @xmath116 given in @xcite .",
    "here we have ignored the @xmath117 quark mass threshold for simplicity .",
    "as the u - spin symmetry predicts @xmath118 , the lhcb evidence implies @xmath119 in the flavor symmetry limit .",

    "as we discussed earlier , the up fcnc model is motivated to explain the top quark forward - backward asymmetry .",
    "figure [ dcpv ] shows the best fit parameter region for such @xmath68 .",
    "the dominant contribution for top quark @xmath50 is through @xmath9 coupling which is @xmath128 in the above model . for a particular choice of @xmath129 ,",
    "the parameter space is consistent with the 1  @xmath16 fitting of @xmath130 @xcite .",
    "the flavor violating processes not only appear in the low energy physics but also appear in the collider experiments .",
    "however , due to the challenge in the identification of the light quarks states , only when the flavor violation involves top quarks directly , the measurements become possible . in these models with up fcnc , both @xmath5 and @xmath6 effects are observable at hadron collider .",
    "the @xmath5 processes correspond to single top production associated with the @xmath68 @xmath7 or @xmath131 . for abelian model",

    "the bounds from flavor physics is only on @xmath137 .",
    "in addition , without phase - space suppression at the 7 tev lhc , the @xmath138 associate production is significant .",
