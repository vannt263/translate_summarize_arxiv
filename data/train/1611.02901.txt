    ", a dessin denfant has associated a bipartite graph , but the dessin is not uniquely determined up to isomorphisms by it . in this paper",
    "we provide an algorithm which permits to construct all non - isomorphic dessins denfants , together their automorphims group , monodromy groups and orientability type , having the same underlaying bipartite graph . in section [ sec : appendix ] we describe , for a particular bipartite graph , the implementation of the above algorithm into gap @xcite which we have used for all our examples in section [ sec : ejemplos ] for certain classical bipartite graphs .    as an example of our algorithm , for the double - prism shown in figure [ doubleprism ] ( see example [ sec : doble - prisma ] ) , we are able to find two non - isomorphic dessins denfants @xmath6 and @xmath7 with the same bipartite graph , both of genus one , the same passport @xmath8 and isomorphic monodromy groups .",

    ", each loop @xmath20 provides an extra involution @xmath86 that permutes both edges of @xmath83 contained in @xmath20 and acts as the identity on all other edges ; and the group generated by @xmath87 and all the involutions @xmath88 ( where @xmath20 runs over all lops of @xmath1 ) generates the group @xmath89 . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath1 has no loops , @xmath89 is naturally isomorphic to @xmath70 .",
    "next , we will recall some definitions and facts about dessins denfants ( the reader may look , for instance , at @xcite ) .    an _ embedding _ ( or a drawing ) of a graph @xmath45 on a closed orientable surface @xmath2 , denoted this by the symbol @xmath90 , is a pair of injective functions @xmath91 and @xmath92 , so that @xmath93 is a an arc homeomorphic to the unit open interval , @xmath94 for @xmath95 , @xmath96 ( for every @xmath53 and every @xmath97 ) , if @xmath53 is incident to @xmath20 , then @xmath98 belong to one extreme of @xmath93 and every extreme of @xmath93 belongs to @xmath99 .",

    "in this way , the study of @xmath0-cell embedding of finite and connected graphs on closed orientable surfaces is , in some way , equivalent to the study of @xmath0-cell embeddings of clean bipartite graphs .",

    "the genus of @xmath2 is also called the genus of the dessin denfant .",
    "a face of the dessin denfant is topologically a polygon of @xmath104 sides , where @xmath105 ; we say that that face has degree @xmath106 .",
    "the passport of the dessin denfant is the tuple @xmath107 where @xmath76 @xmath108 @xmath109    note that the tuple @xmath110 is the passport of the underlying bipartite graph @xmath1 .",

    "next , we label the edges of @xmath1 with numbers in @xmath21 without repeating . for each black ( respectively , white ) vertex we chose a cyclic permutation of the edges at the @xmath113-image of that vertex in counterclockwise order ( here we are using the orientation of @xmath2 ) .",
    "we then consider , in @xmath38 , the permutation @xmath114 ( respectively , @xmath115 ) obtained as the product of all these cyclic permutations at black ( respectively , white ) vertices .",
    "the subgroup @xmath37 of @xmath38 , which is a transitive subgroup by the connectivity of the underlying graph , is called the _ monodromy group _ of the dessin denfant .    by the construction , the number of disjoint cycles of @xmath114 ( respectively , @xmath115 ) is @xmath14 ( respectively , @xmath16 ) and the number @xmath116 of faces is equal to the number of disjoint cycles of @xmath117 .",

    "two dessins denfants @xmath122 and @xmath123 are called _ isomorphic _ ( respectively , _ non - orientable - isomorphic _ ) if there is an orientation - preserving ( respectively , orientation - reversing ) homeomorphism @xmath124 and an isomorphism of bipartite graphs @xmath125 ( i.e. , @xmath126 sends black ( respectively , white ) vertices to black ( respectively , white ) vertices , so that @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",

    "let us enumerate the edges of each dessin and consider the corresponding monodromy groups @xmath131 and @xmath132 , respectively .",

    "we have that @xmath139 ( this happen when the dessin has no orientation - reversing automorphisms ) . a dessin denfant admitting an orientation - reversing automorphism is called _",
    "reflexive_. there is a natural homomorphism @xmath140 ( which is injective if the graph can not be embedded in a circle ) and its restriction @xmath141 ( which is always injective ) .",
    "if we fix a labelling of the @xmath20 edges of @xmath1 using numbers in @xmath21 without repeating , then the obtain a monodromy group @xmath142 of @xmath42 and also an injective homomorphism @xmath22 .",
    "the isomorphic image @xmath143 is the centralizer of the monodromy group , that is , the group formed by those permutation commuting with @xmath114 and with @xmath115 .",
    "the group @xmath144 is the monodromy group of some dessin denfant @xmath145 ; called the _ conjugated dessin _ of @xmath42 . the riemann surface structure defined by @xmath145 is the conjugated of that defined by @xmath42 .",
    "these two conjugated dessins are isomorphic if and only if @xmath42 admits an anticonformal automorphism ( i.e. , if the dessin is reflexive ) ; otherwise , @xmath42 and @xmath145 is a chiral pair .",

    "as consequence of weil s descent theorem @xcite , every belyi pair can be defined over the field @xmath151 of algebraic numbers .",
    "on the other direction , belyi s theorem @xcite asserts that if @xmath147 is a closed riemann surface which can be defined by an algebraic curve over @xmath151 , then @xmath147 is a belyi curve ( and its has a belyi map over @xmath152 ) .",

    "it is well known that there is bijective correspondence between the equivalence classes of the following objects ( see e.g @xcite )    1 .",

    "finally , two permutations @xmath164 , of orders @xmath165 and @xmath166 as in ( 4 ) , with @xmath167 , give rise to a fuchsian group @xmath155 as in ( 3 ) by considering the epimorphism @xmath168 obtained by sending the generators @xmath169 of @xmath170 to @xmath114 and @xmath115 , respectively , and setting @xmath171 .",
    "we use freely this correspondence and we will speak of the belyi pair , the fuchsian group and the permutation representation ( or monodromy group ) defining ( or associated to ) a dessin @xmath42 .    as a consequence of the previous correspondence , there is a faithful action of @xmath5 on the collection of dessins denfants . if @xmath42 is a dessin d enfant and @xmath172 , then @xmath173 will denote the image of the dessin denfant @xmath42 by the action of @xmath114 .",
    "the following properties of the dessin denfant are invariant under the action of the absolute galois group @xcite :    1 .   the number of edges . 2 .   the passport .",
    "3 .   the genus .",
    "4 .   the monodromy group .",
    "the group of automorphisms .",
    "a consequence of the above is that the passport of the underlying bipartite graph is also kept invariant under the action of the absolute galois group ; but not necessarily the isomorphism type of the graph .",
    "unfortunately , the above galois - invariants are not in general enough to decide if two dessins denfants belong to the same galois orbit ( examples can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "a dessin denfant @xmath102 is called _ orientable _ if we may paint its faces in two different colours so that adjacent faces have different colours . in @xcite",
    "it has been shown that orientability is another galois invariant of a dessin denfant and the following fact .",
    "let @xmath102 be a dessin denfant with associated permutations @xmath114 and @xmath115",
