    "v we present our conclusions .",
    "inflation not only explains the large - scale homogeneity of the universe , but also provide a mechanism for explaining the observed level of _ inhomogeneity _ as well . during inflation , quantum fluctuations on small scales",
    "are quickly redshifted to scales much larger than the horizon size , where they are `` frozen '' as perturbations in the background metric .",
    "the metric perturbations created during inflation are of two types : scalar , or _ curvature _",
    "perturbations , which couple to the stress - energy of matter in the universe and form the `` seeds '' for structure formation , and tensor , or gravitational - wave perturbations , which do not couple to matter . both scalar and tensor perturbations contribute to cmb anisotropies .",
    "scalar fluctuations can also be interpreted as fluctuations in the density of the matter in the universe .",
    "scalar fluctuations can be quantitatively characterized by the comoving curvature perturbation @xmath20 . as long as slow - roll is attained ,",
    "the curvature ( scalar ) perturbation at horizon crossing can be shown to be @xcite @xmath21_{k = a h}.\\ ] ] here , @xmath22 denotes the slow - rolling scalar field dominating the energy density of the universe during inflation , the so - called _ inflaton _ , @xmath23 is the hubble rate and @xmath24 gev is the planck scale .",
    "the slow roll approximation is consistent if both the slope and curvature of the inflaton potential @xmath25 are small ( in planckian units ) , @xmath26 . in this case",
    "the slow - roll parameter @xmath18 can be expressed in terms of the potential as @xmath27 we will also need in the following a second `` slow - roll parameter '' @xmath19 defined by @xmath28.\\ ] ] slow roll is then a consistent approximation for @xmath29 .",
    "the fluctuation power spectrum is , in general , a function of wavenumber @xmath30 , and is evaluated when a given mode crosses outside the horizon during inflation , @xmath31 . outside the horizon , modes do not evolve , so the amplitude of the mode when it crosses back _ inside _ the horizon during a later radiation- or matter - dominated epoch is just its value when it left the horizon during inflation . instead of specifying the fluctuation amplitude directly as a function of @xmath30 , it is convenient to specify it as a function of the number of _ e_-folds @xmath32 before the end of inflation at which a mode crossed outside the horizon .    the _ scalar spectral index _",
    "@xmath6 for @xmath20 is defined by @xmath33 so that a scale - invariant spectrum , in which modes have constant amplitude at horizon crossing , is characterized by @xmath11 .",
    "the power spectrum of tensor fluctuation modes and the corresponding tensor spectral index is given by @xcite @xmath34_{k = ah } \\nonumber \\\\ n_t & \\equiv & \\frac{d\\ln p_t}{d\\ln k}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the ratio of tensor - to - scalar modes is then @xmath35 , so that tensor modes are negligible for @xmath36 . in the limit of slow roll , the spectral indices @xmath6 and",
    "@xmath37 vary slowly or not at all with scale . we can write the spectral indices @xmath6 and @xmath37 to lowest order in terms of the slow roll parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 as @xmath38 the tensor / scalar ratio is frequently expressed as a quantity @xmath7 , which is conventionally normalized as @xmath39 the tensor spectral index is _ not _ an independent parameter , but is proportional to the tensor / scalar ratio , given to lowest order in slow roll by @xmath40 .",
    "this is known as the consistency relation for inflation .",
    "a given inflation model can therefore be described to lowest order in slow roll by three independent parameters : @xmath20 , @xmath41 , and @xmath6 .",
    "if we wish to include higher - order effects , we would have to include a fourth parameter describing the running of the scalar spectral index , @xmath42 .",
    "the method we adopt is based on the publicly available markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) package ` cosmomc ` @xcite .",
    "we sample the following eight - dimensional set of cosmological parameters , adopting flat priors on them : the physical baryon and cdm densities , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , the ratio of the sound horizon to the angular diameter distance at decoupling , @xmath45 , the scalar spectral index , its running , and the overall normalization of the spectrum , @xmath6 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 at some pivot scale @xmath30 ( either @xmath48 mpc@xmath49 or @xmath50 mpc@xmath49 ) , the tensor contribution @xmath7 , and , finally , the optical depth to reionization , @xmath51 .",
    "furthermore , we consider purely adiabatic initial conditions , we impose spatial flatness , and we use the inflation consistency relation to fix the value of the tensor spectral index @xmath52 .",
    "we also restrict our analysis to the case of three massless neutrino families ; introducing a neutrino mass in agreement with current neutrino oscillation data does not change our results in a significant way .",
    "we include the five - year data @xcite ( temperature and polarization ) with the routine for computing the likelihood supplied by the wmap team and available at the ` lambda ` web site http://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/. we also perform an analysis based on the wmap five - year data in combination with results from the arcminute cosmology bolometer array ( acbar ) @xcite .",
    "the mcmc convergence diagnostic is done on @xmath53 chains though the gelman and rubin `` variance of chain mean''@xmath54``mean of chain variances '' @xmath55 statistic for each parameter .",
    "our 1d and 2d constraints are obtained after marginalization over the remaining `` nuisance '' parameters , again using the programs included in the ` cosmomc ` package .",
    "furthermore , we make use of the hst measurement of the hubble parameter @xmath56 @xcite by multiplying the likelihood by a gaussian likelihood function centered around @xmath57 and with a standard deviation @xmath58 . finally , we include a top - hat prior on the age of the universe : @xmath59 gyrs .",
    "we perform the analysis in two ways : first , we constrain parameters with a prior assumption of @xmath60 , _",
    "i.e. , _ an exact power - law perturbation spectrum , and second , with @xmath61 a free parameter in the mcmc .",
    "we include lensing in the calculation , and marginalize over the sunyaev - zeldovich amplitude using the wmap v - band template .",
    "all fits are performed at a pivot scale of @xmath62 , which is different from our previous analysis and the analysis of dunkley _",
    "et al . _ and komatsu _ et al . _",
    ", all of which are normalized to a pivot scale of @xmath63 .",
    "the reason for the different choice of pivot scale is to mitigate the parameter degeneracy between @xmath6 and @xmath61 @xcite , which significantly improves convergence of the mcmc code . in the case of @xmath64 ,",
    "the choice of pivot scale has no effect on the spectral index @xmath6 , since a change of pivot affects only the normalization : @xmath65 however , the change of pivot results in a rescaling of the tensor / scalar ratio @xmath7 which is dependent on @xmath7 and @xmath6 , since @xmath66 and therefore , using the consistency relation @xmath67 , @xmath68    figure [ fig : wmapnorun ] shows @xmath69% and @xmath70% confidence limits on @xmath7 and @xmath6 in the case of a no - running prior , @xmath64 .",
    "clearly the choice of the pivot scale makes very little difference in this case ( and since it is just a normalization for @xmath7 , no difference at all in the @xmath14 case . )    in fig .",

    "in this paper we presented an analysis of the recent wmap five - year data set with an emphasis on parameters relevant for distinguishing among the various possible models for inflation .",
    "this analysis is an update to our similar analysis of the wmap three - year data set @xcite . in that analysis",
    ", we reached three main conclusions , which are either unchanged or slightly strengthened by the new data : ( 1 ) the harrison ",
    "zeldovich model is within the @xmath0 confidence level contour .",
    "we find that marginalizing over all parameters except @xmath6 and @xmath7 in the wmap5 data , the likelihood of the h - z point @xmath10 , @xmath11 is 0.0988 , corresponding to exclusion of the h - z model with confidence level of @xmath12 .",
