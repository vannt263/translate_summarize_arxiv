    "these `` linearizable '' boundary conditions were identified by the requirement that the eigenfunction @xmath102 , which satisfies the @xmath35-part of the associated lax pair evaluated at @xmath26 ( as well as the condition that @xmath246 equals the identity matrix ) , satisfies the `` symmetry '' relation @xmath247 in this equation the map @xmath108 is the map which leaves the dispersion relation of the linearized version of the given nonlinear pde invariant ( for the sg , @xmath248 ) and @xmath92 is a non - singular matrix .    in this paper",
    "we have generalized equation ( 5.1 ) to the equation @xmath249 where @xmath250 is a nonsingular matrix .",
    "furthermore we have given an algorithmic way of constructing @xmath251 by making use of the existence of different lax pair formulations for the same nonlinear pde .",
    "we expect that the systematic use of bcklund transformations will provide an approach to computing @xmath250 for any linearizable boundary condition .",
    "the main advantage of our method is _ not _ that it identifies linearizable boundary conditions , but that for such boundary conditions it expresses the solution @xmath2 in terms of a simple riemann - hilbert ( rh ) problem .",
    "the basic features of this problem are similar with the basic features of the rh problem characterizing the solution of the classical initial - value problem , namely these two rh problems : ( a ) have the _ same _ explicit @xmath234 dependence .",
    "( b ) their jump matrices involve the functions @xmath5 and @xmath6 which are constructed from the initial conditions in a similar manner . regarding differences between these two rh problems , we note that the rh problem associated with initial - boundary value problems has the novelty that it is formulated on a more complicated contour , and it also involves some additional jump functions which however can be _ explicitly _ written in terms of @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( see equations ( 1.10 ) ) .",
    "the existence of a more complicated contour does _ not _ add any significant complexity to the analysis of the rh problem .",
    "also in some cases it is possible to map this contour to the usual contour which is the real @xmath4-axis .",
    "this is actually the case for the sg and the nonlinear schrdinger [ 7 ] ( but _ not _ for the korteweg - devries and the modified korteweg - devries ) .",
    "the simplicity of the basic rh problem has important implications for the analysis of the long time asymptotics .",
    "indeed , in the case that the boundary conditions decay as @xmath252 , it is possible using the deift - zhou approach [ 8 ] to obtain a complete characterization of the solution as @xmath253 and @xmath254 .",
    "the general structure of the asymptotics is given in [ 9 ] , where it is shown that the solution is dominated by solitons .",
    "a detailed investigation of these solitons for the boundary condition ( 1.4b ) , as well as for the boundary condition @xmath255 will be presented elsewhere .",
    "we also note that the simplicity of the basic rh problem makes it possible , using the deift - zhou - venakides approach [ 10 ] , to study the zero dispersion limit of initial - boundary value problems [ 7 ] , [ 11 ] .",
    "several authors have identified linearisable boundary conditions using the existence of symmetries and conservation laws , see for example [ 12][13 ] . the analysis of such boundary conditions using several formal rh problems was presented in [ 14 ] .",
    "the particular cases of either @xmath256 or @xmath257 are discussed in [ 15 ] using an extension of the problem from the half line to the infinite line ( such an extension is _ not _ possible for pdes with a third order derivative such as the kdv and the modified kdv equations ) .",
    "a discussion of the physical significance of the sg with the boundary condition ( 1.4b ) as well as several approaches for the analysis of this problem can be found in [ 16][21 ] . in particular in [ 18 ] the question of the integrability of both the classical and quantum sine - gordon theory involving @xmath258 with the boundary condition @xmath259 was investigated . by demanding that a modification of the first non - trivial integral of motion of the usual theory remain conserved",
    "it was found that in general @xmath260 where @xmath261 and @xmath262 are arbitrary real constants . in [ 18 ]",
    "the existence of an infinite number of integrals of motion for this system was assumed and the associated quantum field theory was studied . in [ 17 ]",
    "the question of integrability of the classical system with the boundary condition ( 5.3 ) was addressed .",
    "the results of [ 16 ] were used to prove that an infinite number of integrals of motion do exist , but only for certain @xmath263 .",
    "it was found that ( 5.4 ) is the most general boundary term compatible with the existence of infinitely many conserved quantities .",
    "this result thus agrees with [ 18 ] . the boundary condition ( 5.4 ) with @xmath264 or @xmath265 has appeared in classical considerations of sine - gordon theory .",
    "it was suggested in [ 18 ] that the scattering theory can depend on the extra parameter @xmath262 ; a similar question was investigated in [ 20 ] for real coupling affine toda field theory .",
    "i am deeply grateful to e. corrigan for suggesting this problem to me , and to a.r . its for some important suggestions and in particular for showing me the relation between the two different lax pair formulations of the sg equation .",
