    "the manipulation of a spin polarization is also crucial .",
    "a spin polarization can be genegrated by optical , magnetic and electrical means .",
    "optically , one uses light to transfer angular momentum to charge carriers during interband transitions.@xcite this reliable procedure has been tested successfully decades ago , yet devices that require an input of light are currently impractical .",
    "magnetically , one uses the zeeman effect , to which similar observations apply .",
    "electrically , one drives a current from a spin - polarized material into an unpolarized one and thus carry spin - polarized electrons across the interface .",
    "this works in the case of metals but modern technology relies overwhelmingly on semiconductors , and spin injection from ferromagnetic metals into semiconductors is hampered by the resistivity mismatch @xcite at the interface between the metal and the semiconductor , which causes most of the spin polarization to be lost at the interface .",
    "another avenue explores the use of ferromagnetic semiconductors@xcite as spin injection devices , but room temperature ferromagnetism in semiconductors remains a long - term goal .    as a result of these challenges , purely electrical means of spin generation",
    "have been sought .",
    "the past decade has witnessed an explosion of interest in electrically - induced spin phenomena in semiconductors and metals , which has accompanied significant experimental and theoretical progress .",
    "it has been found that the application of an electric field gives rise to a nonequilibrium spin density in the bulk of the sample , discussed in refs .",
    "[ @xcite-@xcite ] , and a nonequilibrium spin current , discussed in refs .  [ @xcite-@xcite ] .",
    "the appearance of a steady - state spin density in an electric field was predicted several decades ago @xcite and subsequently observed in tellurium .",
    "@xcite this work was followed by a number of theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite studies .",
    "spin currents also have a long history , their theoretical prediction stretching back almost four decades to the work of dyakonov.@xcite the theoretical work was , however , not followed by experiments , and the topic was silent for over a quarter of a century , until the theory picked up again , led by hirsch @xcite , murakami _ _ et al.__@xcite and sinova _",
    "et al_.@xcite during the recent surge of interest in electrically - induced spin phenomena the focus has been principally on spin currents , with the ultimate goal of _ measuring _ spin flow in a given direction . in the absence of",
    "a _ spin - ammeter _ , initially the only way of detecting a spin current relied on measuring the spin accumulation it produced at the edge of the sample .",
    "this procedure , as will be discussed below , is complicated by the fact that the spin current is often not well defined and its relationship to spin accumulation is not clear . thus one can detect a spin accumulation at the edge of the sample as a result of the spin current , but inferring the size of the spin current from such a measurement is beyond current understanding .",
    "nevertheless , in just a few years experiment has been surging ahead .",
    "first , in a recent experiment , crooker and smith @xcite imaged the flow of spin in semiconductors in the presence of electric and magnetic fields , as well as strain . following that , spin accumulations resulting from spin currents were measured by several groups .",
    "@xcite in what is surely a new generation of experiments , valenzuela and tinkham@xcite made use of the fact that a spin current gives rise to a transverse charge current . relying on a nonlocal technique ,",
    "their group successfully detected a charge current flowing as a result of a spin current in al metal .",
    "cui _ _ et al.__@xcite also observed an electrical current induced by a spin current , though in that case the spin current was generated optically .",
    "this technique was used by several groups @xcite shortly afterwards in the study of platinum- and gold - based structures . in gold",
    "an unusually large spin current was observed@xcite even at room temperature .",
    "room temperature spin currents were also reported by stern _",
    "et al _ @xcite in znse .",
    "thus , from their initial observation four years ago , spin currents have begun an experimental revolution , and the field has matured to the point where experiment and theory interact constructively .",
    "the phenomena discussed in this review are all related to spin - orbit interactions , which are present in the band structure and in potentials due to impurity distributions .",
    "band structure spin - orbit interactions are frequently the most important factor determining spin dynamics in solids , and are particularly important in semiconductors , where carriers involved in steady - state processes have wave vectors well within the first brillouin zone . at these wave vectors , while the spin - orbit contribution to the carrier energy is still smaller than the kinetic energy , it plays an important role in determining the energy spectrum",
    ". band structure spin - orbit coupling may arise from the inversion asymmetry of the underlying crystal lattice @xcite , from the inversion asymmetry of the confining potential in two dimensions @xcite , and may be present also in inversion symmetric systems .",
    "@xcite spin - orbit coupling is also in principle present in impurity potentials .",
    "spin - orbit interactions in the impurity potentials cause skew scattering , or asymmetric scattering of up and down spins , giving scattering - dependent or _",
    "extrinsic _ contributions to spin currents .",
    "finallly , spin - orbit interactions cause a modification of the position and velocity operators , which affects the interaction with an electric field as well as the scattering term .",
    "this last mechanism is referred to as side jump and is typically classified as extrinsic although its contributions are manifold .",
    "these extrinsic mechanisms were discovered in the anomalous hall effect @xcite but have acquired a new relevance in recent years in electrically - induced _ spin _ phenomena .    in charge transport",
    ", the steady state is characterized by a nonequilibrium density matrix that is divergent in the clean limit , indicating a competition between the electric field , accelerating charge carriers , and scattering , which inhibits their forward motion .",
    "the density matrix is a scalar and the correction to it caused by the electric field is @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the impurity density .",
    "when considering the steady state of systems with spin - orbit interactions three different situations are distinguished : the case when only extrinsic mechanisms are important , the case when only band - structure mechanisms are important , and the case when both extrinsic and band - structure mechanisms are important .",
    "the differences between these cases are significant and nontrivial .",
    "if band structure spin - orbit interactions are negligible and only extrinsic mechanisms are important , there is no spin precession and the correction to the spin density matrix due to an electric field is very similar to the correction to the scalar density matrix in charge transport .",
    "this correction is @xmath0 and it gives rise to a steady - state spin current but not to a steady - state spin density .",
    "there have been many studies of extrinsic spin currents in semiconductors ( refs .",
    "[ @xcite-@xcite ] ) and metals ( refs .  [ @xcite,@xcite ] . )",
    "nonequilibrium corrections that arise as a result of band structure spin - orbit coupling in crystal hamiltonians represent a different kind of interplay between the electric field and scattering processes .",
    "the spin - orbit splitting of the bands gives rise to spin - dependent scattering even from spin - independent potentials , and spin currents and spin densities in an electric field arise from linearly independent contributions to the density matrix .",
    "the steady - state density matrix contains a contribution due to precessing spins and one due to conserved spins .",
    "steady - state corrections @xmath0 are associated with the _ absence _ of spin precession and steady - state corrections independent of @xmath1 are associated with spin precession .",
    "steady - state corrections @xmath0 give rise to spin densities in external fields while steady - state corrections independent of @xmath1 give rise to spin currents in external fields .",
    "scattering between these two distributions induces significant corrections to steady - state spin currents , and may cause spin currents to vanish .    the phrase _ spin current _ refers to the flow of spins across a sample and ,",
    "if spin were conserved , one could distinguish between spin - up and spin - down charge currents . in systems with band structure spin - orbit interactions",
    "the spin current is not well defined @xcite and its relationship to spin accumulation is unclear .",
    "spin transport in these systems usually does not involve charge transport as the charge currents in the direction of spin flow cancel out .",
    "in addition , since spin currents may be accompanied by steady - state spin densities , this makes it more difficult to separate experimentally the signals due to these contributions .",
    "the study of spin currents in systems with band structure spin - orbit interactions has thus encountered a number of profound physical issues on which no consensus exists at present .",
    "there has been considerable research has on definitions of spin currents in such systems ( refs .",

    "spin densities in semiconductors were first predicted by ivchenko @xcite and observed the following year in tellurium by vorobev .",
    "@xcite recent experiments@xcite have also reported the observation of a steady - state spin density in semiconductors . experimentally the spin density can be found by kerr rotation , in which a beam of linearly - polarized light is sent into the sample and its polarization vector rotates by an angle that is proportional to the spin polarization .    in so far as measuring a spin current ,",
    "the situation is more complicated .",
    "initially the approach adopted was to generate a spin current which would flow to the edges of the sample where it would produce a spin accumulation .",
    "this spin density at the edge of the sample could then be detected by kerr rotation or an equivalent technique .",
    "j.  wunderlich _ et al . _",
    "@xcite used photoluminescence to detect a spin accumulation due to a spin - hall current in a two dimensional hole gas , which is believed to be due to spin - orbit interactions in the band structure .",
    "@xcite used kerr rotation to detect a spin accumulation due to a spin - hall current in @xmath257-gaas , in which the spin current is believed to be due to extrinsic mechanisms @xcite .",
    "a similar experiment was carried out shortly thereafter by sih _",
    "@xcite used the same technique to detect a spin - hall current in znse at room temperature . following this work , sih _ et al . _",
    "@xcite performed an experiment designed to demonstrate explicitly that the observed edge spin accumulation was due to the spin - hall effect , as opposed to edge effects associated with the electric field .",
    "the group manufactured samples with a series of transverse channels , such that the spin - hall current generated by the electric field was allowed to drift into regions where the electric field was effectively zero . since",
    "a spin accumulation was still measured at the edge , this showed unambiguously that the effect was due to the spin current .",
    "further experiments by stern _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite imaged the spatial distribution of the spin accumulation generated by the spin - hall effect as well as its behavior in a magnetic field .",
    "_ et al.__@xcite also reported , using photoluminescence , a spin accumulation due to the spin - hall effect in ingan / gan superlattices .",
    "a second type of experiments relies on an effect referred to as the inverse spin - hall effect .",
    "briefly , a spin current in turn generates a charge current , which can be detected by conventional means .",
    "this was shown by hirsch @xcite and its extension to a landauer - buttiker type multi - terminal nonlocal measurement was presented by hankiewicz _",
    "et al_.@xcite this technique was used by valenzuela and tinkham @xcite to detect a charge current as a result of the spin current in aluminium , and by saitoh _",

    "@xcite reported a giant spin hall effect in fept / au devices .",
    "the group used a multi - terminal device with a gold cross and fept acting as a spin injector .",
    "the spin - hall resistance was measured to be 2.9 m@xmath187 and is attributed to the large skew scattering in gold , being thus extrinsic in nature .",
    "_ @xcite carried out similar experiments on platinum , aluminium and gold and obtained results in agreement with those found to date .",
    "it should be noted that cui _ _ et al.__@xcite also observed an electrical current induced by an optically - generated spin current .",
    "whereas the scientific community working on steady - state spin densities and currents appears to be in agreement that spin currents exist and are experimentally measurable , a number of questions remain to be addressed in the future .",
    "for example , the relative magnitude of band structure spin currents and spin currents due to extrinsic mechanisms such as skew scattering and side jump remains to be determined for a general band structure spin - orbit interaction .",
    "in addition , the fact that no unique definition of the spin current exists causes difficulties in the comparison of experimental data with theoretical predictions .",
    "this ambiguity is exacerbated by the fact that different definitions of the spin current give results that often differ by a sign .",
    "@xcite thanks to the non - conservation of spin , the relationship between spin current and spin accumulation at the boundary remains to be clarified .",
    "it appears that what happens at the boundary is sensitive to the type of boundary conditions assumed.@xcite thus so far as quantitative interpretation of experimental data is concerned , theory still has some way to go .    on the experimental side , despite tremendous progress , the community is still searching for a reliable way to _ measure _ , as opposed to _ detect _ , spin currents directly .",
    "a possible new experimental avenue relies on magnetoresistance caused by an edge spin accumulation , proposed by dyakonov .",
    "@xcite a spin current produces a spin accumulation near the sample edges , which in turn causes the sample resistance to decrease by a small amount , whereas an external magnetic field can destroy the edge spin polarization and yield a positive magnetoresistance .",
    "an alternative path was followed by wang _",
    "et al._,@xcite who started from the dirac equation and obtained in the weakly relativistic limit a set of maxwell equations in the presence of spin - orbit interactions .",
    "although the spin current does not appear explicitly , it is contained in the maxwell equations and the authors demonstrate that the relativistic conservation laws imply that the spin current yields an electrical polarization , which could be detected directly .",
    "similarly , a set of maxwell - like equations for spin was formulated by bernevig _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite these methods remains to be attempted experimentally .",
    "practically , the question of what to do with the electron spin once it has been generated or transported to the edge of the sample remains . the revolutionary electronic device that harnesses spin currents for a practical purpose remains to be made , and the challenge of its design confronts experimentalists and theorists alike .                                                                                                                                                                                                      out of the many texts on this topic , the excellent exposition by j.  rammer , _ quantum transport theory _ ( perseus books , reading ma , 1998 ) stands out .",
