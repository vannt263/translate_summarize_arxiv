    "one of the central results of the theory of phase transitions and critical phenomena is the formulation of the universality hypothesis  @xcite . according to the theory ,",
    "all systems with the same dimensionality , the same symmetry of the ordered phase and the same number of order parameters are described by the same set of critical exponents at the critical point . additionally , thermodynamic functions vary with temperature in such a way that some combinations of their amplitudes take the same values for all systems within a universality class  @xcite . for many systems , critical exponents",
    "are known by approximate methods ( field theoretical perturbation theory , series expansions , monte carlo simulations ) and have been derived exactly in some cases , mainly for two - dimensional models  @xcite . the extensive research in the last 50 years gives strong support for the universality hypothesis in the context of the critical exponents  .",
    "at the same time , the issue of critical amplitude ratios was checked only for a few models  @xcite .",
    "special interest in the properties of universality classes derives from cases in which the singular behavior is complicated by logarithmic corrections @xcite .",
    "there are some systems which belong to the same universality class but whose off - critical behavior may be modified by logarithmic corrections .",
    "this is the case for the universality class of the two - dimensional 4-state potts model .",
    "the model , which gives the name to this universality class , the 4-state potts model  @xcite contains logarithmic corrections to the critical behavior  @xcite of thermodynamic quantities .",
    "for example , the free energy @xmath0 and the magnetization @xmath1 in the ordered phase behave at criticality as  @xcite @xmath2^{\\alpha_l } \\",

    "it is known exactly  @xcite that close to the critical temperature , the free energy and the magnetization in the ordered phase behave as @xmath10 with the same values for the critical exponents as in ( [ f-4-potts ] ) and ( [ mag-4-potts ] ) , but without logarithmic corrections to the singular behavior .",
    "a possible explanation for the difference in the off - critical behavior of the baxter - wu and 4-state potts models is that for some unknown reason the coefficient behind the logarithmic correction is zero for the baxter - wu model  @xcite , although the leading critical behavior for both models seems to be described by the same fixed point in the renormalization - group space  @xcite .",
    "critical amplitudes are not universal and one should not expect that the free - energy amplitudes @xmath11 of the baxter - wu model and @xmath12 of the 4-state potts model are equal . at the same time , some combinations of the amplitudes are universal . for example , the ratio of the free - energy amplitude @xmath13 in the high - temperature phase of the baxter - wu model to the amplitude @xmath14 in the low - temperature phase equals unity , as well as the ratio of the corresponding amplitudes of the 4-state potts model @xmath15 .",
    "this is a consequence of the duality relation for the free energy of the two models  @xcite .",
    "the ratio of the susceptibility amplitudes @xmath16 , on the other hand , is not known exactly and different approximations ( analytical , series expansions , monte carlo data ) from different groups are not coherent and differ substantially ( for a recent discussion , see the papers  @xcite ) . it is well known that logarithmic corrections , if they exist , complicate the critical behavior and render the analysis of the critical behavior extremely difficult if possible at all , and the determination of critical exponents from monte carlo ( mc ) and series expansions ( se ) became non - trivial . in fact , the determination of critical exponents and corrections to scaling may lead to indecisive conclusions  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to estimate numerically critical amplitudes of the baxter - wu model , which is free of logarithmic corrections , and to compare universal amplitude ratios with the ones available for the 4-state potts model .",
    "it should be emphasized that critical amplitude ratio universality is a non - local property of the renormalization group phase space whereas the critical exponents characterize its behavior only in the vicinity of the corresponding fixed point .",
    "we use the traditional metropolis mc algorithm to simulate the baxter - wu model , and analyze the magnetization and polarization in the ordered phase , and the energy , specific heat and magnetic susceptibility in both phases .",
    "we estimate the accuracy of our data by comparing the magnetization , polarization , energy and specific heat to available exact results .",
    "in particular , we use the known results for the energy , specific heat , magnetization and polarization in order to estimate the critical temperature window , i.e. , the range of temperatures in which the system on a finite lattice behaves to a very good approximation as on an infinite one .",
    "this allows us to estimate the critical ratio of the susceptibility amplitudes in the high- and low - temperature phase with good accuracy , @xmath17 .",
    "the analytical estimate of this ratio , obtained by delfino and cardy  @xcite using some approximation of the exact scattering field theory  @xcite , is only slightly larger , @xmath18 .",
    "delfino and grinza  @xcite obtained practically the same value @xmath19 using the same approximation for the ashkin - teller model with parameters which correspond to the 4-state potts model universality class .",
    "a recent analysis of the mc and se data for the 4-state potts model gives an amplitude ratio in the range of about @xmath20  @xcite . at the same time , the values for the universal combination of amplitudes @xmath21 in the low - temperature phase reported in ref .",

    "@xcite are @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the specific - heat and magnetization amplitudes ) .",
    "this is in perfect agreement with our estimate @xmath26 we present here for the baxter - wu model .    in the rest of the paper we present the details of our analysis of the amplitude ratios for the baxter - wu model . in section  [ sec - model ] and",
    "[ sec - previous ] we first give an overview of known analytical results and previous numerical simulations which support them .",
    "we then discuss in section  [ sec - simulations ] details of our simulation algorithm realization , including the special choice of the lattice , averaging , etc .",
    "section  [ sec - results ] presents the details of our critical amplitude estimation , and the discussion in section  [ sec - discussion ] summarizes our results and touches on some open questions .",
    "in this section we summarize those known analytical results for the baxter - wu model which will be used in the lattice construction , algorithm realization and data analysis .",
    "the baxter - wu model is defined on a triangular lattice , with spins @xmath27 located at the vertices .",
    "the three spins forming a triangular face are coupled with a strength @xmath28 , and the hamiltonian reads    @xmath29    where the summation extends over all triangular faces of the lattice , both pointing up and down .",
    "the model is self - dual as found by wood and griffiths  @xcite and merlini and gruber  @xcite , who applied the kramers - wannier construction developed for the square - lattice ising model , and showed that both models , ising on the square lattice and baxter - wu on the triangular lattice , share the same self - dual temperature ( see also the book  @xcite ) .",
    "the partition function reads @xmath30 \\ , , \\label{part - z}\\ ] ]    where @xmath31 .",
    "the dimensionless free energy per site is @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the number of lattice sites .",
    "it satisfies the duality relation    @xmath34    where @xmath35    this is precisely the duality relation of the square lattice ising model .",
    "the argument of kramers - wannier can be applied : if there exists just one critical point , then it must occur when @xmath36 , where @xmath37      let @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 denote all the spins on the @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 sub - lattices , respectively .",
    "any total configuration @xmath44 of spins has the same energy as three others .",
    "these configurations can be obtained by flipping all spins on two of the sub - lattices .",
    "the spin configurations can be grouped in equal - energy sets of four : @xmath45 the ground state is thus four - fold degenerate : one ferromagnetic state with magnetization ( per site ) @xmath46 and three ferrimagnetic states with @xmath47 .",
    "baxter and wu solved the model at the critical temperature exactly  @xcite and found that the critical value of the energy @xmath48 is @xmath49 , the specific heat @xmath50 diverges at @xmath9 as  @xcite @xmath51 and the critical behavior of the magnetization for @xmath52 is  @xcite @xmath53 where here the reduced temperature is defined as @xmath54 .",
    "the critical exponents thus take the values @xmath3 and @xmath4 , which is the two - dimensional 4-state potts model universality class .",
    "joyce established analytic properties of the free energy per spin and found the explicit form  @xcite @xmath55 where @xmath56 \\ , , \\label{lambda - joyce}\\ ] ] with @xmath57 denoting the hypergeometric function and @xmath58 such that the critical point value in this variable is @xmath59 .",
    "the specific heat critical behavior follows as @xmath60 where @xmath61    the magnetization reads  @xcite ( @xmath62 ) @xmath63 where @xmath64    some time later , baxter  @xcite found an elegant form for the free energy in terms of an infinite sum of the ratio of some polynomials .",
    "the magnetization ( and also the polarization defined below in eqs .",
    "( [ pol - d ] ) and  ( [ bw - pol ] ) ) can be expressed in terms of an infinite product of ratios of polynomials .",
    "these expressions may be used to obtain the energy , specific heat , magnetization and polarization with any desired accuracy .",
    "the summary of analytical results is presented in this section in a form which is most suitable for the analysis of the data discussed here .",
    "in course of their simulation study of the influence of quenched impurities on the critical behavior , novotny and landau  @xcite performed for comparison also first monte carlo analyses of the pure baxter - wu model .",
    "they defined the magnetic order parameter @xmath65 as the root - mean - square ( rms ) of the magnetization on the three sub - lattices .",
    "the polarization order parameter @xmath66 was defined as the rms average of the two - spin correlation functions for the nearest - neighbor spins between different sub - lattices .",
    "they pointed out that the rms rather than the the absolute value of the sum of the sub - lattice magnetizations was used because the susceptibilities calculated using the rms definition gave results that were in closer agreement with high- and low - temperature series - expansion results .",
    "finite - size scaling plots of the order parameters , the magnetization @xmath67 and polarization @xmath68 , as functions of @xmath69 are consistent with @xmath70 and @xmath71 . in the symmetric phase ( @xmath72 ) those plots show in a log - log representation a decay with slope @xmath73 , approaching asymptotic values at very large values of @xmath69 .",
    "the energy , specific heat , and susceptibility also behave according to the baxter - wu predictions .",
    "they simulated lattices with linear size @xmath74 up to @xmath75 and estimated magnetic susceptibility amplitudes , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , and polarization amplitudes , @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "therefore , the ratio of amplitudes is about @xmath80 with an uncertainty of about 50 per cent .",
    "in their monte carlo renormalization - group ( mcrg ) analysis , novotny , landau , and swendsen  @xcite did not find any evidence for logarithmic corrections in the baxter - wu model on lattices with sizes @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 .",
    "for the rg eigenvalues they estimated @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and results for @xmath86 were consistent with the barber ansatz  @xcite @xmath87 , based on the renormalization group analysis .",
    "the latter exponent is the correction - to - scaling magnetic exponent @xmath88 ( see , refs .",
    "@xcite and the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which produces the correction - to - scaling exponent @xmath89 in the specific heat  ( [ heat - joyce ] ) and magnetization  ( [ m - joyce - t ] ) .",
    "the operator content of the baxter - wu model has been discussed by alcaraz and xavier  @xcite , who extended the original bethe ansatz solution of the site - coloring problem and solved numerically the corresponding equations of the transfer matrix for toroidal boundary conditions .",
    "they found that the latter problem has the same operator content as the 4-state potts model .",
    "the correction - to - scaling effects seem , however , to correspond to different perturbations of the fixed point of the renormalization group .",
    "the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite claim that the correction - to - scaling terms contain only integer powers , like those in the ising model .",
    "genuine critical behavior can be observed only in the thermodynamic limit , when the system approaches infinite size .",
    "simulations , on the other hand , are always performed on finite lattices  .",
    "finiteness of the lattice leads to such effects as scaling of thermodynamic quantities with the lattice size at criticality  @xcite , and the shift  @xcite of the pseudo - critical point   in the limit of infinite lattice size , and the maximum value of thermodynamic quantities diverges accordingly . ] .",
    "an additional source for systematic deviations in the simulations is due to the approximation of the aspect ratio which is often overlooked .",
    "the central idea is to choose such a form of the finite lattice and boundary conditions for which the number of sites and number of bonds would be the same in either direction , and on both the prime and its dual lattice  .",
    "this is the property of the model on the infinite lattice .    .",
    "]    we construct the triangular lattice by using the three elements shown in the top row of fig .",
    "[ fig - drei - elem ] .",
    "we associate one of the three colors with each site and bond , and use the convention that the sum of r ( red ) , g ( green ) , and b ( blue ) vanishes , or , equivalently , equals to w ( white ) color .",
    "the rule of construction is that a site of the same color should never be a neighbor , and the same condition should hold for the bonds .",
    "this is the natural partition of the baxter - wu lattice on the three sub - lattices .",
    "we denote in fig .",
    "[ fig - drei - elem ] a r - site with a circle , a g - site with a box , and a b - site with a triangle .",
    "g - bonds are denoted in fig .",
    "[ fig - drei - elem ] with a solid line , b - bonds with a dashed line , and r - bonds with a dotted line .    the minimal lattice size which follows the above mentioned requirements is shown at the bottom of fig .",
    "[ fig - drei - elem ] .",
    "it contains exactly three sites of different colors and three bonds of different colors in any of the three lattice directions with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the sum of site colors and bond colors is white along any lattice direction ( by definition , @xmath90 ) .",
    "this @xmath91 lattice can be used as an elementary building block for constructing larger lattices .",

    "there are the three sub - lattices for the baxter - wu model labeled r , g , and b , therefore the total number of sites ( and bonds ) should be a multiple of three .",
    "the bonds between each two sub - lattices form a hexagonal lattice : for removed sites r it is composed by the hexagons formed by the red bonds @xmath94 , for removed sites g by the hexagons formed by the green bonds @xmath95 , and for removed sites b by the hexagons formed by the blue bonds @xmath96 .",
    "such construction keeps the symmetry of the baxter - wu model .",
    "in addition , the baxter - wu model is self - dual and our choice of the lattice construction keeps self - duality not only in the thermodynamic limit , but also for any finite size of the lattice .",
    "this in turn minimizes the possible influence of the approximation for the aspect ratio  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that monte carlo simulations of the baxter - wu model experience strong finite - size effects and an application of the traditional metropolis algorithm becomes costly due to the critical slowing down .",
    "novotny and evertz  @xcite proposed some time ago a cluster algorithm for the baxter - wu model .",
    "recently , this algorithm has been extended to the generalized self - dual baxter - wu model  @xcite .",
    "the main idea is that the hamiltonian is invariant under the transformation where all spins on the two sub - lattices are changed .",
    "the algorithm fixes the spins on one sub - lattice and builds up clusters of correlated spins on the remaining two sub - lattices ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - drei ] ) .",
    "it is , however , not obvious that such clusters which live on the subspace of possible configurations will percolate at the critical point of the baxter - wu model .",
    "indeed , we found that the percolation point of such clusters seems to be shifted a little bit to lower temperatures . as a result",
    "this leads to the shift of the curves for some observables .",
    "the same effect was found recently for the behavior of fortuin - kasteleyn clusters in the z@xmath97 spin model  @xcite . despite the slowing - down problem , we therefore resorted in our simulations to the traditional metropolis update algorithm .      to update the spin configurations with the metropolis algorithm  @xcite we calculate the local energy of a spin at position @xmath98 , @xmath99    if @xmath100 , we flip spin @xmath101 .",

    "[ c - ht - fin ] , where one can see visible deviations of the mc data sets from the exact solution for very small @xmath144 . for temperatures @xmath145 , however , the shown data sets coincide with each other and with the exact result .",
    "for that values of temperature , the correlation length becomes smaller than the system size and the relation @xmath146 holds better for larger reduced temperatures .    for large ( absolute ) values of reduced temperature ,",
    "the computational data become more and more close to the exact values . at the same time , the solid line , which represents an approximation to the exact solution , starts to diverge from the computational data , because higher - order correction - to - scaling terms , which are not included in the approximation , become more and more important for larger reduced temperatures .",
    "so , the critical temperature window is bounded for smaller reduced temperatures @xmath147 by finite - size effects and for larger reduced temperatures @xmath147 by the neglected correction - to - scaling terms in the analysis .",
    "we have to stress that the left boundary of the temperature window is determined clearly by the nature of the phase transition  it is the temperature at which two length scales coincide : the ( randomly ) fixed system size and the temperature dependent correlation length",
