    "the study of the propagation of flexural waves in thin plates has received an increasing attention recently , due to the possibilities in their control offered by new structures like phononic crystals @xcite , arrays of attached resonators @xcite or transformation - coordinate based devices @xcite .",
    "therefore , applications such as cloaking shells @xcite or negative refractive lenses @xcite have been experimentally demonstrated , opening the door to new and exciting devices for the control of vibrations .",
    "in addition to all these phenomena related with classical waves in general , the propagation of flexural waves in thin plates presents the peculiarity that it can be controlled by means of thickness variations , as was theoretically studied by v.v .",
    "krylov @xcite . known as wedges ,",
    "these structures produce a gradual reduction in the velocity of the wave by changing the plate s local thickness .",
    "experimental investigations have been carried out on a variety of plate - like and beam - like structures @xcite .",
    "the principle of wave control by locally changing the plate s thickness has been applied to achieve efficient damping of flexural waves in plate - like structures using the so called `` acoustic black holes '' ( abh ) @xcite , which consist of specifically designed pits with small pieces of absorbing materials attached in the middle @xcite .",
    "oboy introduced then a modification in the abh by perforating a hole in the center of the pit @xcite and e.p .",
    "bowyer studied the effect of imperfections in the fabrication method of the abh @xcite and the result of placing multiple abh together in a plate @xcite . for more information on these topics ,",

    "@xcite and using the ross - ungar - kerwin ( rku ) model @xcite , in this work a new device is designed and numerically tested .",
    "the objective of the proposed device is to isolate a given area in a thin plate from vibrations .",
    "this objective is accomplished by surrounding it by a properly designed thickness - inhomogeneous region which will attract and dissipate vibrations on the plate , accomplishing then a double objective . from one side , the central region will be properly isolated , from the other one",
    ", the device will dissipate the vibrations on the plate .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : theory ] introduces the kirchoff - love approximation for modeling the behavior of flexural waves in thin plates and the method to design the structure is explained .",
    "section [ sec : absorbing ] explains the ross - kerwin - ungar ( rku ) theory used to model the behavior of an absorbing layer placed on top of an elastic plate .",
    "following , in section [ sec : design ] the design and optimization of the device are explained and in section [ sec : results ] the performance of the device is tested using a numerical simulator based on a multilayer algorithm .",
    "finally , the conclusions are presented in the last section and the multilayer algorithm is explained in appendix a.",
    "the equation of motion describing flexural waves in thin plates is modeled using the kirchoff - love approximation @xcite , in which the vertical displacement @xmath0 of the plate is obtained from the bi - helmholtz equation ( assuming harmonic time dependence of frequency @xmath1 )    @xmath2    being @xmath3 the flexural rigidity , @xmath4 the mass density , @xmath5 the thickness of the plate , @xmath6 the young modulus and @xmath7 the poisson ratio . for plane wave propagation with wavenumber",
    "@xmath8 the above equation gives a quadratic dispersion relation    @xmath9    and a phase velocity @xmath10    it can be seen that the phase velocity @xmath11 is a function not only of the physical properties of the plate , but it also depends on its thickness .",
    "this dependence allows the design of gradient index devices for flexural waves easily by means of local variation of the plate s thickness .",
    "effectively , the refractive index as a function of the plate s thickness is    @xmath12    @xmath13 being the wave speed in the background , @xmath14 the background s thickness and @xmath15 the position - dependent thickness .",
    "it has been assumed that all the other elastic properties of the plate remain unchanged .",
    "equation [ refindx ] describes how the refractive index increases with decreasing thickness .",
    "it is important to notice that , despite being an intrinsically dispersive medium , the refractive index does not depend on the frequency of the wave , thus the functionality of the designed devices will be limited by the accuracy of the flexural wave model only .",
    "schematic view of the structure studied in the present work .",
    "the central circular region is surrounded by a thickness - varying shell so that it is isolated from the propagation of flexural waves on the plate .",

    "it consist of a circularly symmetric region in which the thickness of the plate is gradually changed according to the desired functionality . in this case",
    ", a well - like profile is placed surrounding a central area , which corresponds to the region that has to be isolated from external vibrations . following the analogy with acoustic and electromagnetic waves for similar devices @xcite , the objective of the decreasing height ( increasing refractive index ) region is to act as an `` attractive '' potential , so that it tends to concentrate vibrations , while the inner region of increasing height ( decreasing refractive index ) will act as a `` repulsive '' potential , isolating in this way the central region .",
    "all waves traveling around this device will be concentrated at the bottom of the well where , as will be explained below , they will be dissipated .",
    "the proposed structure will be theoretically studied by means of a multiple scattering method , where the variation of the height is discretized and then the structure is modeled as a multilayered shell .",
    "this method requires the application of the proper boundary conditions at each layer , for which it is necessary to know their physical properties .",
    "as has been previously said , the only parameter that changes from layer to layer is the plate s thickness , except at the bottom of the well , where a dissipative material will be placed .",
    "next section will describe the model to be used to analyze this absorbing layer .",
    "the objective of the device analyzed in this work is to concentrate waves in a given region and then dissipate them .",
    "this dissipation will be made by placing an absorptive material of thickness @xmath16 in contact with a plate of thickness @xmath17 on the region of interest , as shown in figure [ fig_schemelayer ] . to properly apply to this system the multiple scattering method described in the appendix , this region",
    "must be modeled as a single layer with a given young modulus @xmath18 , thickness @xmath19 , poisson ration @xmath20 and density @xmath21 .",
    "absorption is introduced in the model by adding a complex part in the young modulus called the loss factor @xmath22 , such that @xmath23 , therefore the model must also provide the composite loss factor @xmath24 .     geometry employed to dissipate the vibrations on the plate .",
    "an absorbing layer ( thickness @xmath16 ) is placed on the top of the plate ( thickness @xmath17 ) .",

    "the material properties are the ones from table [ tab_mat ] .",
    "it is seen that when the thickness of the plate decreases , a minor change in the thickness of the layer changes the loss factor greatly .",
