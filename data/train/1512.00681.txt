    "the solution of the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) that describes the interaction of an intense electromagnetic pulse with an atom or a molecule is a very challenging problem from the numerical point of view .",
    "this is particularly true in the long wavelength limit where the numerical calculations become rapidly intractable even for one - active electron systems . in this situation",
    ", one has to rely on analytical or semi - analytical models that , in addition , offer the advantage of providing valuable insight into the physical mechanisms that underly the interaction processes .",
    "+ the first model that laid the foundation of our understanding of laser - atom interactions has been developed by keldysh . in 1965 , he published a seminal paper @xcite on the nonlinear ionization of atoms and dielectrics by strong electromagnetic waves .",
    "this model describes , in the length gauge , the transition of an atom , from an initially unperturbed bound state to a dressed continuum state .",
    "this dressed continuum is a volkov state @xcite .",
    "it takes into account the electron - field interaction at all orders while neglecting completely the coulomb potential .",
    "keldysh introduced the adiabaticity parameter @xmath0 where , in atomic units , @xmath1 is the photon energy , @xmath2 the ionization potential and @xmath3 the electric field amplitude .",
    "he showed that tunneling and multiphoton ionization are actually two limiting cases of nonlinear ionization : tunneling is the dominant process for @xmath4 while for @xmath5 , ionization proceeds by the absorption of many photons .",
    "+ soon after keldysh s contribution , perelomov , popov and terentev ( ppt ) published a series of papers @xcite .",
    "their model is based on the approximate solution , in the length gauge , of a time - dependent lippmann - schwinger like equation .",
    "it involves a green s function which is expressed in terms of the classical action and it is assumed that the initial state is hardly depleted . for electrons bound by short range forces , the ppt approach reproduces the keldysh theory . in the limit where the coulomb field is much smaller than the external field",
    "so that it can be regarded as a small perturbation , effects due to the long range of the coulomb potential are accounted for in the classical action @xcite .",
    "in addition , and contrary to keldysh theory , the ionization rate , averaged over the laser period , tends to the correct value in the adiabatic ( quasi - static ) limit .",
    "+ later , when the first experimental data on the above - threshold ionization spectra became available , reiss @xcite and faisal @xcite developed an approach based on the s - matrix theory in the velocity gauge .",
    "it is after these papers that the terminology `` strong field approximation '' ( sfa ) appeared .",
    "in fact , what is understood as the sfa , is the first term of the perturbative series in the coulomb potential associated to the s - matrix .",
    "high order terms of sfa describe multiple re - scattering of the electron by the ionic core @xcite as this electron undergoes a quiver motion driven by the external electric field .",
    "it is important to note that the s - matrix treatment can also be developed in the length gauge by using the @xmath6 form of the interaction hamiltonian . in that case one",
    "obtains the keldysh result at the first order .",
    "+ sfa has been widely used to describe the mechanism for many strong field phenomena such as high order harmonic generation @xcite , high energy electron spectra and even processes involving more than one electron like non - sequential double photoionization @xcite .",
    "however , sfa has a serious flaw : the length and velocity gauge versions of sfa give results that may differ significantly @xcite .",
    "this problem is still unsolved . within this context ,",
    "it is interesting to mention here three commonly accepted viewpoints which are nicely summarized in @xcite : ( i ) the problem of the gauge invariance is misunderstood and a proper treatment of the full `` atom+field '' hamiltonian should make the velocity and the length gauge versions of the sfa amplitude equivalent ; ( ii ) there is a preferable gauge ( depending on the physical process under consideration ) which should be used in the calculations ; ( iii ) in the present stage , the theory is essentially non - invariant and should be modified to restore the gauge invariance property .",
    "+ in attempting to modify the sfa theory along the lines of the third viewpoint , faisal @xcite managed to reformulate his s - matrix based approach and obtained a new gauge invariant sfa .",
    "in fact , his new sfa is identical to the old length - gauge sfa but differs from the old velocity - gauge sfa .",
    "this might also indicate that the length gauge is the preferable one .",
    "however , we show that it is not the case .",
    "+ in this contribution , we consider the interaction of atomic hydrogen with a strong pulsed oscillating field and we develop a rather transparent approach that shows that the different sfa schemes can be grouped into a set of different families . in a given family , the length and the velocity sfa schemes give the same results at all orders in the coulomb potential .",
    "however , irrespective of the gauge , two sfa schemes belonging to different families give different results .",
    "the two gauge invariant sfa schemes obtained by faisal belong to the same family .",
    "the main idea of the present method is to introduce an ansatz that describes the electron wave packet as the sum of the initial wave function times a phase factor and a function which is the solution of an inhomogeneous tdse that can be solved iteratively to generate a perturbative series in the coulomb potential .",
    "it is essentially the phase factor that defines a given family .",
    "furthermore , this simple reformulation of the sfa schemes allows us to address the two following important questions regarding the validity of the sfa schemes .",
    "the first one concerns the final state on which the sfa wave packet should be projected on to get the electron energy spectrum . in principle",
    ", this final state must be a coulomb wave .",
    "however , in order to avoid enormous difficulties from the analytical point of view , coulomb waves are usually replaced by plane waves .",
    "this further approximation is questionable in the case of very low energy electrons .",
    "the second important question concerns the convergence of the perturbative series in the coulomb potential .",
    "we address this question by solving numerically and iteratively the inhomogeneous tdse and show in one particular case how the electron energy spectrum changes after the inclusion of increasing order terms . in all cases , the sfa results are compared to those obtained by solving numerically the tdse . +",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii is devoted to the theory .",
    "we first transform the tdse into a time - dependent lippmann - schwinger like equation .",
    "it is this equation that is the starting point of the ppt approach .",
    "the problems inherent to that equation are discussed in detail and justify the introduction of the particular ansatz we use to generate various families of sfa schemes .",
    "we focus on two particular families and establish their connection to existing sfa schemes .",
    "the third section is devoted to the numerical treatment of the tdse within the sfa schemes . finally , before concluding , we compare two schemes based on an ansatz belonging to different families .",
    "this is done by calculating in a realistic situation the electron energy distribution along the polarization axis and by comparing the sfa results to those obtained by solving the tdse .",
    "+ atomic units ( @xmath7 ) combined with the gaussian system for the electromagnetic field are used throughout unless otherwise specified .",
    "in this contribution , we consider fields linearly polarized along the z - axis and assume that the dipole approximation is valid . at this stage , we define the vector potential and the electric field for a given time @xmath8 as follows : @xmath9 where @xmath10 , the expression of which will be specified later , vanishes for @xmath11 and @xmath12 , with @xmath13 being the total pulse duration .",
    "@xmath14 is a unit vector along the z - axis .",
    "it is also convenient to define the following quantity : @xmath15 ^ 2,\\ ] ] and to write the canonical momentum @xmath16 and the action @xmath17 in terms of @xmath10 : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the electron momentum . in the following ,",
    "we use a tilde accent for quantities defined in the configuration space and no accent if the same quantity is defined in momentum space .",

    "however , this is only true for the exact solution . in the case of the sfa for instance , neglecting this term may lead to wrong results @xcite .",

    "their solutions are related by the well known gppert - mayer gauge transformation : @xmath25 in the case of weak fields , we could treat the dipole interaction hamiltonian as a perturbation .",

    "( [ eq_tdse_vg ] ) and proceed as we did above .",

    "( [ eq_green_vg])-([eq_iv ] ) by its l - gauge version @xmath35 .",

    "a closer look to the first term @xmath32 in the integral equation ( [ eq_phi_vg_green ] ) shows that it undergoes a rapid dispersion due to the presence of the @xmath40 term in the expression ( [ eq_volkov_vg ] ) of the volkov wave function @xmath34 .",
    "in addition , since this exponential term @xmath40 does not depend on the external field , it means that this rapid dispersion occurs even in the absence of the external field .",

    "this may be justified when @xmath43 is an arbitrary wave packet . in our case",
    "however , the atom is and must stay in a stationary state in the absence of an external field .",
    "one can prove that @xmath44 satisfies eq .",
    "( [ eq_phi_vpt ] ) which can not be solved iteratively .",
    "+ there are at least two ways of circumventing this difficulty .",
    "the first one is to follow the ppt approach .",
    "the starting point of this approach is the l - gauge version of the integral equation ( [ eq_phi_vg_green ] ) .",
    "since the first term is affected by a rapid dispersion , it does not contribute to the current and can be neglected .",
    "furthermore , the exact wave packet that enters in the second term is replaced by the initial state wave function under the assumption that the mean time of ionization is much larger than the atomic times .",
    "the second way consists in introducing an ansatz to describe the exact wave packet as the sum of the initial stationary state times a phase factor and a function that is the solution of an inhomogeneous tdse .",
    "+      let us first consider the v - gauge .",
    "the ansatz we introduce consists in separating the initial bound state component from the other components of the electron wave packet @xmath24 .",

    "let us mention that a more rigorous calculation of the electron energy spectrum requires the projection of the full wave packet on coulomb waves with incoming wave asymptotic behavior .",

    "<S> we consider the interaction of hydrogen - like atoms with a strong laser field and show that the strong field approximation and all its variants may be grouped into a set of families of approximation schemes . </S>",
    "<S> this is done by introducing an ansatz describing the electron wave packet as the sum of the initial state wave function times a phase factor and a function which is the perturbative solution in the coulomb potential of an inhomogeneous time - dependent schrdinger equation . </S>",
    "<S> it is the phase factor that characterizes a given family . in each of these families , the velocity and length gauge version of the approximation scheme lead to the same results at each order in the coulomb potential . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , irrespective of the gauge , approximation schemes belonging to different families give different results . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , this new formulation of the strong field approximations allows us to gain deeper insight into the validity of the strong field approximation schemes . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we address two important questions : the role of the coulomb potential in the output channel and the convergence of the perturbative series in the coulomb potential . in all the physical situations we consider here , </S>",
    "<S> our results are compared to those obtained by solving numerically the time - dependent schrdinger equation . </S>"
