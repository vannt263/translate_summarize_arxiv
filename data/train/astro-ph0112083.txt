    "there are strong reasons for suspecting that the emitting plasma of @xmath0-ray bursts ( grbs ) is geometrically beamed in a cone .",
    "the energy requirements can then be reduced below the exorbitant levels that isotropic emission would imply ( kulkarni et al .",
    "1999 ) and in most models for the long bursts it is in any case a natural expectation  borne out by simulations ( macfadyen & woosley 1999 ; macfadyen , woosley & heger 2001 )  that the relativistic outflow from a central engine should be collimated along a channel that opens up along the rotation axis of a massive star .",
    "although the relativistic mhd that gives rise to jets is uncertain , and surely very complicated , most discussions of the radiation from gamma ray bursts ( and their afterglows ) has postulated a jet with a well - defined angle ( meszaros & rees 1997 ) , though this angle may differ for different bursts ( see , however , meszaros , rees & wijers 1998 ; salmonson 2001 ) .",
    "we discuss here an alternative model where the jet , rather than having a uniform profile out to some definite cone angle , has a `` beam pattern '' where the power per unit solid angle ( and perhaps also the initial lorentz factor ) is maximal along the axis , but drops off gradually away from the axis .",
    "this would be expected if there is mixing and entrainment from the borders of the funnel .",
    "we discuss the expected time - dependence of the afterglow if it is triggered by a jet with this more general profile .",
    "we conclude that the time of the observed break ( which , for a uniform jet viewed along its axis , depends on the cone angle ; see , e.g. , rhoads 1997 ) instead depends on the angle between the line of sight and the symmetry axis : such a jet viewed nearly head - on simulates a narrow uniform jet , whereas the afterglow from the same jet viewed more obliquely would simulate a wider uniform jet .",
    "grb have been proposed recently to be explosions releasing a standard power that can be either injected in very different jet opening angles or distributed within the jet in some universal emission diagram , ( postnov et al .",
    "2001 ) . while frail et al .",
    "( 2001 , hereafter f01 ) , support with their data the first interpretation , we show that their observational results could instead be attributed to a more standard set of objects viewed at different angles to their symmetry axis .",
    "we suppose that all long grbs have jets with a standard opening angle @xmath1 , total kinetic energy and beam profile for @xmath2 .",
    "we consider a relativistic outflow where both the bulk lorentz factor and the energy per unit solid angle depend as power laws motivated by f01 correlation .",
    "this is not , however , a necessary ingredient of the model as discussed in  6 ( see also fig . 3 and 4 ) ] on the angular distance from the center @xmath3 @xmath4 and @xmath5 where @xmath6 is introduced just for formal reasons to avoid a divergence at @xmath7 , but can be taken to be smaller than any other angle of interest . a lower limit to this angle is @xmath8 degrees , where @xmath9 is the maximum value to which the fireball can be accelerated ( piran 1999 ) . the power law index of @xmath10 , @xmath11 , is not important for the dynamics of the fireball and the computation of the light curve as long as @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "nevertheless , it plays a role when we want to calculate the fraction of grbs - afterglow without prompt @xmath0-ray emission , as we discuss in  6 .",
    "consider an observer at an angle @xmath14 with respect to the axis of the jet .",
    "he measures an isotropic equivalent energy @xmath15 from the @xmath0-ray fluence .",
    "if also the afterglow emission is dominated by the component pointing the earth , he will infer @xmath16 as the half - opening angle of the jet by means of the break time in the light curve , @xmath17 ( sari , piran & halpern 1999 ) @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the external medium density .",
    "since the total energy inferred from all viewing angles is @xmath20const , the observer will derive the same conclusions obtained by f01 and panaitescu & kumar ( 2001 , hereafter pk01 ) of grbs as fireballs with the same total kinetic energy but very different jet apertures .    to evaluate how the contributions of the other components add to the light curve from the zone with @xmath21 we calculate when their beamed emission include the observer direction , ( when @xmath22 ) and which energy per unit solid angle they have at that time compared to @xmath23 .",
    "we show that under the assumptions of eq .",
    "[ eq : top ] the afterglow light curve is indeed dominated by the fireball element along the line of sight : neither the `` core '' of the jet with @xmath24 nor the regions with @xmath25 make substantial contributions .    for an effective though simplified discussion",
    "we consider only three components of the jet corresponding to @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "we call them `` cone @xmath29 '' , where @xmath30 , respectively",
    ". this approach is justified by the fact that only the very inner parts of the jet with @xmath31 and the much wider ( @xmath32 ) outer parts could contribute and substantially modify the light curve of cone @xmath33 .",
    "we approximate cone @xmath34 as a relativistic source moving at an angle @xmath16 with respect the observer , while the observer is approximately considered on the symmetry axis for cones @xmath33 and @xmath35 .",
    "the cones , that are not causally connected ( @xmath36 ) , evolve independently and adiabatically in a constant density medium and spread sideways when @xmath37 drops below @xmath38 ( rhoads 1997 ) .",
    "we consider relativistic lateral expansion of the cones so that their geometrical angles @xmath39 grow as @xmath40 since the dynamics of the fireball components changes at @xmath41 , also @xmath10 decreases with time differently before and after the break time . for @xmath42 @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the deceleration time at which @xmath45 and the jet begins to decelerate significantly . from eq .",
    "[ eq : gamma ] to eq .",
    "[ eq : tb ] we drop the subscript @xmath29 for an easier reading . for @xmath46 @xmath47 this on - axis calculation is valid for all @xmath48 , because @xmath49 soon after the break time and the emitting plasma enters the line of sight : from this moment we can consider the observer to be on the cone axis .",
    "the lateral expansion starts at a time @xmath50 where the deceleration time , @xmath44 , depends on @xmath51 and consequently @xmath52 therefore from eq .",
    "[ eq : top ] it follows that @xmath53=constant and @xmath54 cones @xmath33 and @xmath35 are hollow but they spread only outwards because the inner components which have already expanded ( for cone @xmath35 ) or are about to do so ( for cone @xmath33 ) have higher pressure .",
    "[ eq : tb ] shows also that when @xmath55 and the part of the blast generated by the core of the jet becomes visible to the observer , cone @xmath33 has just started spreading .",
    "the contribution of region @xmath34 to the light curve of the cone with @xmath16 is not dominant because when @xmath56 the energy per unit solid angle is comparable to @xmath57 @xmath58 the regions with @xmath59 spread at later time , so when @xmath60 the energy per solid angle of cone @xmath33 has already decreased with time but it remains always comparable to @xmath61 @xmath62    where @xmath63 is the break time for cones @xmath29 and we used eq .",
    "[ eq : gammatb ] and eq .",
    "[ eq : tb ] .",
    "therefore the regions with @xmath64 , ( or those with @xmath3 substantially above @xmath16 ) , do nt determine the overall shape of the light curve , because they are hidden by the dominant emission from the component along the line of sight . in principle , the superposition of many components of energy given by eq .",
    "[ eq:9 ] and  [ eq : dtb ] may give rise to a sizable contribution .",
    "as shown by the more detailed calculation of   3.2",
    "( see fig  2 ) , this is not the case and the only effect is to delay by a factor of 2 the time of the break .",
    "consequently the energy per unit solid angle that is measured modeling the afterglow is @xmath57 and the time break depends only on the viewing angle @xmath16 .",
    "in order to compute a reasonably accurate lightcurve in our model , we adopt the following approach .",
    "we divide the inhomogeneous jet in @xmath65 hollow cones ( all but the very central one ) , each characterized by energy per unit solid angle and lorentz factor given by eq .",
    "[ eq : top ] .",
    "we compute an approximate lightcurve for each sub - jet using three asymptotic behaviors .",
    "for the cones with @xmath66 and @xmath67 we adopt the @xmath24 and @xmath25 approximations described in   2 , .",
    "for the cones defined by @xmath68 which point towards the observer since the beginning , we again consider the observer along the symmetry axis , but the emission is calculated in a filled cone geometry , instead of the hollow one adopted for the other cases .",
    "for @xmath69 we use the usual afterglow theory to perform the lightcurve calculations , while for @xmath66 we generalize it for an off - axis observer as explained in the following section .      consider a uniform jet with lorentz factor @xmath10 and initial half - aperture @xmath70 .",
    "the radiative process is synchrotron emission ( meszaros & rees 1997 ) and we concentrate on the power law branch of the spectrum between the peak , @xmath71 , and the cooling , @xmath72 , frequencies . the observed flux at a frequency @xmath73 , time @xmath74 and viewing angle @xmath16 is @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the emitting area and @xmath77 is the relativistic doppler factor .",
    "@xmath78 is the comoving intensity at the comoving frequency @xmath79 and at the comoving time @xmath80 @xmath81 due to the relativistic beaming , the observed flux depends on the observer angle . in particular , if @xmath82 @xmath83 while for @xmath84 @xmath85 in this case the jet is initially a source moving at an angle @xmath16 with the observer . at the break time @xmath86",
    "and then it starts decreasing very fast ( eq .",
    "[ eq : gamma ] ) until @xmath87 and we can again use the approximation that the jet is viewed on - axis .",
    "so the intensity , the change in the slope and the break time of the afterglow depend on the observer viewing angle . in fig .",
    "[ fig : jetto ] we show the resulting off - axis lightcurve for a jet with opening angle @xmath88 as viewed with off - axis angles @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 degrees .",
    "the flat part of the lightcurves corresponds to the time interval between the beginning of the jet spreading and the time in which the jet enters the line of sight . in this time interval",
    "our approximations are no longer valid and we simply model the lightcurve with a flat component connecting earlier and later times .",
    "this crude approximations is likely responsible for the slight flattening of the final lightcurves ( see below and fig .  [",
    "fig : jetti ] ) just before the break .",
    "using eq .",
    "[ eq : fon ] and eq .",
    "[ eq : foff ] we can compute the total light curve as a sum over the fireball components according to the scheme described at the beginning of this section .",

    "n is the number of jet components that are beamed around the line of sight at small times .",
    "the results of this calculation are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : jetti ] for different viewing angles . on top of the solid lines we plot with a dashed line the lightcurve of a homogeneous fireball with @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "this shows that , for @xmath100 , the lightcurve of an inhomogeneous jet can be successfully modelled with the lightcurve expected for a homogeneous jet : @xmath101 for @xmath102 and @xmath103 for @xmath104 .",
    "one of the main simplifications that we made in eq .",
    "[ eq : lc ] is to assume that the observer is on the jet axis of the cones with @xmath105 .",
    "the main consequence is to predict a transition between the two power - law branches sharper than what we expect from the exact integration .",
    "this is due to the fact that , even in a uniform jet , off - axis observers sees smoother transitions ( see fig . 4 of ghisellini & lazzati 1999 ) .",
    "recently an important observational result on the energetic content of grb < s was published by pk01 and f01 .",
    "they found an anti - correlation between the isotropic equivalent energy , @xmath106 and the break time in the afterglow lightcurves .",
    "f01 in particular derived @xmath107 from gamma ray fluences , @xmath108 and their data are consistent with @xmath109 .",
    "they explain it in the framework of collimated , uniform , lateral spreading jets interacting with a constant , low density ( 0.1 @xmath110 ) , external medium .",
    "the observer is postulated to be along the jet axis .",
    "they assume that the afterglow emission steepens because at that time the lorentz factor has dropped to @xmath111 , so that the on - axis observer sees the edge of the jet and the lateral jet spreading becomes important . in this case",
    "@xmath112 is predicted , which matches observation .",
    "they convert the observed break times in jet opening angles through the formulation of sari et al .",
    "the @xmath0-ray energy measured and corrected for the inferred geometry of the jet is clustered around @xmath113 erg .",
    "they concluded that grbs central engines release the same amount of energy through jets with very different opening angles . in this framework , then , the wide distributions in kinetic energy per unit solid angle , which spans 3 orders of magnitude , is due only to the distribution of jet solid angles .",
    "pk01 obtained the same results , modeling a subset of multiwavelength afterglows from which they could assign an external density , a time break and an equivalent isotropic energy for the fireball .",
    "both f01 and pk01 found geometric angles that span an order of magnitude but strongly concentrate around @xmath114 in the framework of our model an alternative explanation of the observed relation between @xmath107 and @xmath17 can be found . as discussed in",
    " 2 and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : jetti ] , we can infer from observations only the properties of the cone pointing towards the observer and not those of the whole jet .",
    "so @xmath115 and using eq .",
    "[ eq : tb ] and eq .",
    "[ eq : top ] we obtain @xmath116 then , the observed distribution of @xmath107 and its relation with @xmath17 is due to an inhomogeneous jet and the possibility to view it from different angles .",
    "under our assumptions , each @xmath0-ray luminosity corresponds to a particular viewing angle . the probability to see a jet between @xmath3 and @xmath117",
    "is given by @xmath118 @xmath119 and the highest probability is for @xmath120 .",
    "therefore it is highly improbable to see a jet on axis .",
    "consequently we expect more faint grbs then very luminous ones according to a luminosity function @xmath121 where @xmath122 .",
    "since there are only a small number of grbs with observed red - shift , the comparison of our predicted luminosity function with data is far from being definitive .",
    "recently bloom at al .",
    "( 2001 ) published an histogram of the bolometric k - corrected prompt energies for 17 grbs .",
    "the distribution is roughly flat from @xmath123 to @xmath124 erg but as the authors emphasize this analysis applies only to observed grbs with redshifts and several observational biases obscure the true underlying energy distribution . the main bias that overcasts faint grbs is the detection threshold of the instruments : this sample is thus flux and not volume limited .",
    "moreover redshift determination encounters more problem for faint grbs .",
    "based on @xmath125-hardness correlation , schmidt ( 2001 ) derived a luminosity function without using any redshift .",
    "they had to assume how the comoving grbs rate varies with redshift and they based their calculations on three star forming rate models . in this case",
    "a power - law luminosity function was derived , but flatter than the @xmath126 predicted in the simplest version of our model . a luminosity function",
    "not based on assumed burst rate evolution can be derived by measuring the burst distance scale through the recently discovered variability - luminosity relation ( fenimore & ramirez - ruiz 2000 , reichart et al .",
    "2001 ) . a cumulative analysis of a sample of 220 bursts ( fenimore & ramirez - ruiz 2000 ) yielded a power - law luminosity function @xmath127 , which compare more favorably with our prediction .",
    "more recently , lloyd - ronning , fryer & ramirez - ruiz ( 2001 ) find that the typical luminosity of grbs evolves with redshift . as a consequence",
    ", a flatter power - law index @xmath128 is obtained .",
    "we stress , however , that our deduced luminosity function can be altered by distributions in total energy or geometric angles or by luminosity evolution with redshift . given the somewhat contradictory observational results discussed above , we conclude that more accurate spectral and fluence measures and a larger sample of bursts are needed for a proper comparison .",
    "we considered inhomogeneous grbs jets with a standard total energy , opening angle and local energy distribution , @xmath129 .",
    "we show that this jet structure can reproduce the observed correlation between isotropic energy and break - time . in this model",
    "both measurements depend only on the viewing angle because the @xmath0-ray fluence and the afterglow emission are dominated by the components of the jet pointing towards the observer at small times .",
    "since all cones have the same total energy @xmath130 , we recover the results of f01 and pk01 but the constrains on the geometrical beaming can be relaxed and an appealing more standard structure for all grbs can be adopted .",
    "the jet total energy can be calculated from eq .",
    "[ eq : top ] @xmath131 and compared to @xmath132 , the total energy inferred from observation , @xmath133 .",
    "to give an example , for a fireball with @xmath134 and @xmath135 , we have @xmath136 , i.e. the true energy of the fireball can be one order of magnitude larger than what inferred with the models of f01 and pk01 .    in addition",
    "(   5 ) we can derive the grbs luminosity function from the probability distribution of the viewing angle and compare it to data .",
    "the comparison is , at this stage , still uncertain because more accurate spectral and fluence measures are required to build a volume limited sample and confirm ( or rule out ) this model .    in any fireball model",
    "considering a jet - like grb structure , a certain number of afterglows without @xmath0-ray emission ( orphan afterglows ) is expected . for an homogeneous jet ,",
    "orphan afterglows are possible only for viewing angles greater than @xmath137 . in our jet configuration",
    "a fraction of the total area could have a lorentz factor lower than the minimum @xmath10 necessary for @xmath0-ray radiation .",
    "consequently , considering the same opening angle , an inhomogeneous jet could produce an higher fraction of orphan afterglows than an homogeneous one .",
    "this intrinsic fraction depends above all on the @xmath10 distribution within the jet ( @xmath11 in eq  [ eq : gammadis ] ) and on the minimum lorentz factors to produce @xmath0-ray radiation and afterglow emission .",
    "the observed number of orphan afterglows depends also on flux detection limits , grb explosion rates with redshift and cosmology .",
    "an accurate calculation of the expected orphan afterglow rates is therefore beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we emphasize that we implicitly assumed the radiation efficiency of the fireball to be weakly dependent on @xmath10 or @xmath138 .",
    "this is a plausible assumption in internal - shocks scenario .",
    "if it was not the case and the efficiency grew with @xmath138 , a different relation between @xmath138 and @xmath3 should be postulated in order to reproduced observations .    in this paper we concentrated for simplicity on a beam profile @xmath139 which is consistent observational results but it is interesting to briefly discuss other power - law relations @xmath140 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : alfae ] ) . a decay flatter",
    "then 2 would cause two breaks in the light curve : the first due to the cone pointing the observer when @xmath141 and the second , at later times , when the observer sees the edge of the jet and @xmath142 .",
    "the power law index after the first break is flatter then @xmath143 because the cones with @xmath144 enter the line of sight with @xmath145 and substantially modify the light curve shape . with a steeper decay in the distribution of @xmath138 the time break and the emission after that break",
    "would be dominated by the jet along the axis rather then by the very much weaker part directed to the observer .",
    "the jet break would then be preceded by a prominent flattening in the lightcurve , especially for @xmath146 , difficult to reconcile with observations . in this case",
    "we would have @xmath0-ray emission only for very small angles and the number of orphan afterglows would be much greater then expected from the @xmath147 model . from eq .",
    "[ eq : tb ] we can derive the relation between the index @xmath148 and @xmath149 ( where @xmath150 ) . we obtain @xmath151 for @xmath152 and @xmath153 for @xmath154 , when the first break is considered . in fig .",
    "[ fig : indi ] we plot this relation overlaid on the interval in @xmath149 allowed by observations ( we used f01 data ) .",
    "we derive @xmath155 , at the @xmath156 level . further @xmath0-ray and afterglow observations will allow to constrain this parameter much better in the future .",
    "besides the luminosity function discussed in   5 , there are several ways in which this model can be proved or disproved .",
    "first , we have shown that the real total energy of the fireball can easily be an order of magnitude larger than what estimated by pk01 and f01 . in this case , after the fireball has slowed down to mild - relativistic and sub - relativistic speed , radio calorimetry ( frail , waxman & kulkarni 2000 ) should allow us to detect the excess energy .",
    "in addition , in this model we naturally predict that the more luminous part of the fireball have higher lorentz factors .",
    "this may help explaining the detected luminosity - variability ( fenimore & ramirez - ruiz 2000 ) and luminosity - lag ( norris , marani & bonnell 2000 ) correlations ( salmonson 2000 , kobayashy , ryde & macfadyen 2001 ; ramirez - ruiz & lloyd - ronning 2002 ) .",
    "another constrain is given by polarization . since",
    "fireball anisotropy is a basic ingredient of this model , inducing polarization ( ghisellini & lazzati 1999 ; see also sari 1999 and gruzinov & waxman 1999 ) .",
    "the time evolution of the polarized fraction and of the position angle are however different from a uniform jet ( rossi et al . in preparation ) .",
    "finally , the properties of the bursts should not depend on the location of the progenitor in the host galaxy , and therefore this model can accommodate the marginal detection of an @xmath157-offset relation ( ramirez - ruiz , lazzati & blain 2001 ) only if a distribution of @xmath70 is considered .",
