    "topological transitivity is a global property of dynamical system . under the assumption of transitivity",
    "the whole space becomes a global attractor , making the dynamics indivisible in some sense .",
    "it also represents a minimal requirement to be able to speak about mixing in the dynamics .",
    "hence , it is not surprising that transitivity is an important ingredient of global ( and topological ) definitions of chaos @xcite .",
    "one of the most known definitions of chaos was introduced by devaney in his book @xcite . in this definition ,",
    "a map is chaotic when it is transitive , sensitive and contains a dense subset consisting of periodic points .",
    "it was soon noticed , that when periodic points are dense and the space is infinite ( in particular , when the space is a non - degenerate continuum ) , transitivity implies sensitivity ( see @xcite or @xcite ) . it is well know ( and not hard to prove @xcite ) that for dynamical systems on the unit interval , transitivity implies that periodic points are dense . in other words ,",
    "each transitive dynamical system on the unit interval is chaotic in the sense of devaney .",
    "it is also known that if the dynamical system @xmath0,f)$ ] is transitive but not mixing , then @xmath1 $ ] decomposes in two proper subintervals @xmath2 $ ] , @xmath3 $ ] such that @xmath4 is a fixed point , @xmath5 and @xmath6 is mixing ( for @xmath7 .",
    "it can also be proven ( see @xcite ) , that on the unit interval , closure of the set of periodic points coincides with the closure of the set of recurrent points ( so - called @xmath8 property ) . in general , dynamics on the unit interval",
    "is well understood and many beautiful and surprising results can be proved in that context @xcite ( e.g. the celebrated sharkovsky theorem ) . an interesting exposition on transitivity and its connection to other notions , with special emphasis on one - dimensional dynamics , can be found in the survey paper by kolyada and snoha @xcite .",
    "a natural questions that comes to mind when considering one - dimensional dynamics is to what extent these results can be generalized beyond the unit interval and what are the minimal assumptions that suffice for these results to hold .",
    "a natural directions of research is to consider a class of  similar  one - dimensional continua and actually it is the way how it was done in the literature .",
    "many authors investigated dynamical properties ( related to density of periodic points ) on topological trees , the circle and next on topological graphs .",
    "in many cases ( after appropriate adjustment ) this direction was successful ( e.g. see appendix in @xcite ) .",
    "a good example of necessary adjustments is the @xmath8 property .",
    "it is still true when we consider topological trees , but on topological graphs it is no longer valid ( e.g. consider an irrational rotation of the unit circle ) .",
    "however it is possible to prove in that case that @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote the set of periodic and recurrent points , respectively ( see @xcite or more recent @xcite ) . of  course",
    ", while the result looks similar , usually there was necessary an essential modification of the arguments in the proof . in some other cases",
    "only partial answers are known ( e.g. characterization of the structure of periods of maps on topological graphs is far from being complete ) . in spite of technical difficulties , in the case of topological graphs dynamical properties",
    "remain to large extent ",
    "similar  to those known from the unit interval .",
    "the first serious problems arise when we consider dendrites . on",
    "these ( one - dimensional ) continua various counterexamples to facts known from the unit interval ( or topological trees ) can be constructed and concrete properties hold only in special cases . for example , if a dendrite has countable set of endpoints then the @xmath8 property holds ( see @xcite ) , but when the set of endpoints points is uncountable then a counterexample can be constructed @xcite .",
    "it was recently proved by dirbk , snoha and pitalsk in @xcite that in the case of dynamical systems on continua with a free interval ( in particular , on dendrites whose endpoints are not dense ) , a transitive map always has dense set of periodic points and has a terminal periodic decomposition .",
    "furthermore , an appropriate iterate restricted to any of the sets in the decomposition is mixing . on the other hand , recently there was constructed an example of a dendrite and a weakly mixing map on it which is not mixing @xcite .",
    "it is also known that there are dynamical systems on dendrites without a maximal @xmath12-limit set @xcite , while for dynamical system on a topological graph , every @xmath12-limit set is contained in a maximal one .",
    "motivated by the above mentioned results for topological trees ( and difficulties in the case of dendrites ) we state the following questions for the future research .",
    "does every transitive dynamical system on a dendrite admit a terminal periodic decomposition ?    provide a complete characterization of transitive dynamical systems on dendrites with dense periodic points .    while we do not know complete answers to the above questions , we are able to provide some partial answers . in theorem  [ main ] we prove that if a dynamical system on a dendrite has at least one point with dense orbit which is not an endpoint then the set of periodic points of @xmath13 is dense in @xmath14 .",
    "we also prove that it may happen that there is a unique periodic point ( thus a fixed point ) but the map is transitive ( construction from @xcite serves as an example ) , or the set of periodic points ( as well as point with dense orbit ) , while dense , is contained in the set of endpoints .",
    "we also provide an example of a map ( and a dendrite with dense set of endpoints ) which satisfies the assumptions of theorem  [ main ] .",
    "this leads us to another open question .",
    "does there exist a dendrite @xmath14 and a mixing dynamical system on it which does not have dense periodic points ?    in section  [ sec :",
    "decomp ] we prove that a totally transitive dynamical system on a dendrite which has periodic points that are not end points at the same time must be mixing .",
    "we also prove that at least one point with dense orbit which is not an endpoint is sufficient for terminal decomposition .",
    "finally , we prove that on almost meshed continua , periodic points of @xmath15 are dense iff they are dense for the induced dynamical system @xmath16 on the space of compact subsets . the class of almost meshed continua , among others , contains all topological graphs and dendrites with closed set of endpoints .",
