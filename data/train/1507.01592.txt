    "the evolution of the clustering amplitude provides the growth factor and the shape of the clustering correlation function or power spectrum depends on early universe conditions and later , scale dependent effects . in addition , redshift space distortions ( rsd ) cause anisotropy in the clustering between the transverse and radial directions , and this probes the velocity field and the law of gravity  @xcite .",
    "general relativity ( gr ) predicts scale independent growth in the linear perturbation regime and specific redshift distortion patterns , and so probing for scale dependence or distortion deviations can test the theory of gravity . our aim is to investigate the general relativity cosmological framework by fitting the galaxy clustering data while allowing for scale dependence , and constrain such deviations .",

    "furthermore , we generalize the previous scale independent growth factor to two quantities : one scale independent ( corresponding to the large scale limit of the growth factor ) and one scale dependent ( which can be thought of as characterizing the scalar - tensor modification , e.g.  @xmath7 or @xmath1 ) .    while we concentrate here on improving the rsd and galaxy clustering analysis for testing gr , various other methods have also been used .",

    "information on the late - time cosmological expansion is encoded in the distances along and transverse to the line of sight .",
    "the distance measurements are not affected by the scale dependent growth functions in @xmath0 gravity models . in section iii",
    ", we varied the scale dependent growth function @xmath146 and the growth rate @xmath147 and found that the bao ring is invariant ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : xivariation_test ] ) . as a consequence ,",
    "there is little change in the measured @xmath105 and @xmath106 from our previous result where scale independent growth functions are assumed  @xcite .",
    "the measured @xmath105 is @xmath148 , and the measured @xmath106 is @xmath149 .",
    "the prediction of the @xmath6cdm model is indicated by the x in fig .",
    "[ fig:2dparam ] , and the measured values , with uncertainties , are presented as filled contours in the top - left panel .",
    "the @xmath6cdm prediction is within the 1-@xmath84 confidence level .",
    "the measured distances are consistent with the results using @xmath6cdm templates presented in the fifth column of table  [ tab : measurements ] .",
    "although we vary galaxy bias @xmath54 in the fitting procedure , it is degenerate with the variation of @xmath93 on quasilinear scales .",
    "thus as previously stated we can regard the combined measurement of @xmath54 and @xmath93 as a probe of @xmath150 , whose measured value is @xmath151 .",
    "again there is little difference from the previous result of @xmath150 using @xmath6cdm templates presented in the fifth column of table  [ tab : measurements ] .",
    "when we fit the measured @xmath87 , the amplitudes of the growth function and growth rate are determined at an effective scale @xmath152 in our analysis . in @xmath0 gravity",
    "the growth functions are enhanced in a scale dependent manner",
    ". therefore if the amplitude of the growth function and growth rate at @xmath153 are tuned to be nearly the same as the @xmath6cdm model ( e.g.  to agree with data ) , then the measured @xmath150 and @xmath46 must be smaller to offset the enhancement .",
    "so for appreciable @xmath154 we expect an anti - correlation between @xmath124 and @xmath46 .",
    "this is visible in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : con_fr_gt ] for the larger values of @xmath124 .",
    "since the best fit @xmath124 is slightly larger than the lcdm bound , this may contribute to why the measured @xmath155 is smaller than the @xmath6cdm result .",
    "however , the prediction of @xmath6cdm presented by the x in fig .  [ fig:2dparam ] is still within the 68% cl measured @xmath46 contours .",

    "the scale dependent growth functions @xmath146 and @xmath147 alter at late times the initial broadband shape probed by the cmb experiments , but the comoving scale of the sound horizon is not affected , and we find the measured bao ring remains the same as in @xmath6cdm and so the distances @xmath105 and @xmath106 do also .",
    "the effect of modified gravity would be most evident in the redshift space distortions and hence anisotropy of the clustering .",
    "we demonstrated how @xmath87 alters with increments of @xmath146 and @xmath147 for small and large @xmath1 values in fig .",
    "[ fig : xivariation_test ] .",
    "this shifts the correlation amplitude at the bao scale and other scales compared with the scale independent growth functions case . at small @xmath99",
    ", there is no significant anisotropic variation with @xmath156 ; the peak locations move nearly coherently anti ",
    "clockwise along the bao ring .",
    "but when @xmath25 increases and it becomes larger than @xmath157 , the effect of anisotropic amplification dominates and @xmath87 departs from @xmath6cdm .    using the boss dr11 data we measure the anisotropic @xmath87 , presented as blue filled contours in fig .",
    "[ fig : dr11 ] , and find a best fit @xmath99 , with an upper bound @xmath158 at the 68% confidence level ; the lower 68% confidence level is consistent with @xmath6cdm .",
    "we also note an anticorrelation between @xmath1 and the scale independent growth rate @xmath55 that could reduce the measured value of @xmath55 despite the enhancement of growth due to @xmath0 gravity .",
    "we tested our data analysis pipeline by applying it to @xmath6cdm mock catalogues , and we reproduced the @xmath6cdm bound of @xmath103 .",
    "we also tested the robustness of our results against the change of the cmb prior .",
    "there is a slight difference in the measured early broadband shape of spectra between wmap9 and planck 2013 , but the measured @xmath25 is independent of this difference .",

    "again our results were shown to be insensitive to a possible scale dependent galaxy bias .",
