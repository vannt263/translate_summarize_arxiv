    "since the discovery of the 125-gev higgs boson at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) , efforts have been made to study in more detail its properties , particularly how it interacts with other particles in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "such an endeavor has partly the mission of exploring whether there is an extended higgs sector and , if so , how it will help us understand the nature .",
    "if certain new physics models , such exotic higgs bosons may hold answers to some long - lasting questions in particle physics , such as the origin of neutrino mass , the identity of dark matter , and the realization of a strong first - order phase transition for electroweak baryogenesis .    as an extension of the sm in the higgs sector , the georgi - machacek ( gm ) model  @xcite has some unique and desirable properties in comparison with other higgs - extended models .",
    "the gm model has a doublet field @xmath2 with hypercharge @xmath3 and a triplet field composed of a complex triplet @xmath4 with @xmath5 and a real triplet @xmath6 with @xmath7 . by starting with a higgs potential with the custodial @xmath0 symmetry and the vacuum alignment between the complex and real triplets",
    ", the model preserves the electroweak rho parameter @xmath8 at tree level while allowing the possibility of a triplet vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , @xmath9 , as large as up to a few tens of gev . through appropriate yukawa couplings with the leptons ,",
    "such a vev can contribute to the mass of neutrinos _  la _ type - ii seesaw mechanism  @xcite .",
    "the couplings between the triplet field and leptons lead to lepton number - violating processes and possibly even lepton flavour - violating ones .",
    "another consequence of the custodial symmetry is mass degeneracy within each higgs multiplet  @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated to be possible to determine the mass and check this property at the large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite .",
    "a distinctive feature of the model is that , among the exotic higgs bosons , there is a doubly - charged higgs boson , @xmath10 , in the 5-plet representation .",
    "such a particle can lead to phenomenologically prominent and interesting signatures at colliders : decays into a pair of like - sign leptons or @xmath11 bosons , depending on the magnitude of @xmath9 . due to the mixing between the higgs doublet and triplet fields",
    ", the couplings between the sm - like higgs boson @xmath12 and the weak gauge bosons can be stronger than their sm values  @xcite and lead to discriminative phenomena  @xcite .",
    "another consequence of significant mixing between the higgs doublet and triplet fields is the possibility of a strong first - order phase transition for electroweak baryogenesis in some parameter space  @xcite .",
    "besides , the model has a tree - level @xmath13 coupling , which is known to be small in multi - doublet models because they appear only at loop levels  @xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , the doubly - charged higgs boson can be searched using the like - sign dilepton and diboson modes . lhc results on the former in the past few years",
    "had placed a lower bound of about 400  gev on its mass for some generic benchmark points of the model  @xcite . the like - sign diboson production with leptonic decays of the @xmath11 bosons",
    "had also been searched for by the atlas collaboration using the @xmath14 fb@xmath15 data at the 7-tev run  @xcite , from which a mass lower bound of @xmath16  gev was derived  @xcite .",
    "more recently , the atlas also measured the total production cross section of like - sign @xmath11 bosons and a pair of jets in the 8-tev run  @xcite .",
    "the reported production cross section in the vector boson scattering fiducial region had been employed to constrain the triplet vev as a function of the doubly - charged higgs mass  @xcite .",
    "of particular interest to the current work is that the 95%  cl upper bound on @xmath9 from the lhc data  @xcite is at the level of several tens of gev , opening up the possibility of studying the gm higgs bosons at lepton colliders .",
    "although in the case of a large triplet vev the exotic higgs bosons have diminishing yukawa couplings with charged leptons , the 5-plet higgs bosons can still be produced via productions in association with weak gauge bosons that serve as promising detection channels at lepton colliders , such as the international linear collider ( ilc )  @xcite , the compact linear collider ( clic )  @xcite , and the circular electron - position collider ( cepc )  @xcite or the electron - positron branch of the future circular collider ( fcc - ee ) .",
    "there are a few earlier studies in this direction .",
    "@xcite examined the possibility of probing this sector using the uniquely featured tree - level vertex of @xmath17 at high - energy @xmath18 colliders .    in this paper ,",
    "we concentrate on the study of how one can test the gm model at the ilc with proposed colliding energies of 500  gev and 1  tev .",
    "we show that with a cleaner collider environment , it is easier to determine the 5-plet mass with high precision at the ilc than the lhc .",
    "we point out that the vector boson associated production processes with the @xmath1 channel can be used to determine the masses of @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "besides , this channel has a wider probing range in the 5-plet mass than the other related multiple weak boson modes .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : model ] reviews the georgi - machacek model and , in particular , give the relations between model parameters and physical observables . in section  [ sec:5plet ] ,",
    "we discuss possible decay patterns of the 5-plet higgs bosons in the model . branching ratios of different charged states",
    "are explicitly worked out as a function of the mass difference between the 5-plet and 3-plet higgs bosons . in section",
    "[ sec : production ] , we give numerical results regarding the production of the 5-plet higgs bosons at the ilc , assuming a center - of - mass energy of 500  gev and 1  tev .",
    "after analyzing the sm backgrounds of several possible gauge boson final states of the exotic higgs production in the model , we concentrate in section  [ sec : reconstruction ] on the @xmath1 events and show that the energy and invariant mass distributions of a subset of these final - state particles can be used to determine the 5-plet mass .",

    "it must be emphasized here that the above - mentioned processes are not significant in the minimal higgs triplet model because of the strong restriction on the triplet vev from the electroweak rho parameter .",
    "the discovery reaches for these processes are worse than that of @xmath192 because of larger cross sections in the sm backgrounds .",
    "a dedicated simulation study for these vbf processes had been done in ref .",
    "@xcite , and it was shown that the significances of the signatures via the @xmath19 and @xmath20 productions are smaller than that via the @xmath10 production .",
    "for example , in the case of @xmath193 gev and @xmath194 gev , the signal significance has been given to be about @xmath195 , @xmath196 and @xmath197 for the collision energy of 14 tev and the integrated luminosity of 100  fb@xmath15 after imposing appropriate kinematic cuts  @xcite . in the analysis , the leptonic decays of @xmath11 and @xmath64 bosons were assumed . as noted in sec .",
    "iii , the sm - like higgs boson coupling @xmath123 can be larger than the corresponding sm value when @xmath198 and @xmath125 .",
    "if such an enhancement is realized , the cross section of the vbf process mediated by the neutral higgs bosons ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath12 , @xmath199 and @xmath105 ) would also be enhanced , rendering a larger signal significance for the process .",
    "the vbf processes with an enhanced @xmath123 coupling had been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and were found to be promising for discovering the 5-plet higgs bosons at the lhc .    a further test for the identification of the gm model is to check the mass degeneracy among @xmath200 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 . in order to reconstruct the masses of these higgs bosons",
    ", it is better to use the hadronic decays of the weak bosons from the decays of the 5-plet higgs bosons .",
    "the energy resolution for the dijet system turns out to be important for the reconstruction .",
    "in particular , the ability to discriminate the dijet event from a @xmath11 boson and a @xmath64 boson is crucial in the test of mass degeneracy .",
    "now , let us discuss the value of ilc experiments for testing the gm model after the lhc experiments .",
    "one of the most important advantages at the ilc is the good energy resolution for jet systems . at the ilc ,",
    "the target energy resolution @xmath201 for a dijet system is @xmath202  gev  @xcite where @xmath203 is the dijet energy .",
    "therefore , @xmath204 gev for @xmath205 gev , which allows us to distinguish dijets from @xmath11 and @xmath64 .",
    "because of this detector performance , there are the following two advantages to test the gm model at the ilc .",
    "first , the precise measurement of the @xmath17 vertex ( or more generally the @xmath104 vertex for physical singly - charged higgs bosons @xmath103 ) is possible via the @xmath206 process . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the feasibility of measuring the @xmath104 vertex has been discussed by using the recoil method ; _ i.e. _ , the reconstruction of a hadronic @xmath11 boson decay , where only leptonic decays of @xmath103 were considered .",
    "second , the good dijet energy resolution makes the analysis of the @xmath207 process discussed in sec .",
    "v realistic . as discussed in sec .",
    "v , the observation of the distinctive peaks at the same position in the invariant mass distributions of @xmath183 and @xmath182 indicates that there are neutral and singly - charged particles with degenerate mass .",
    "testing the mass degeneracy can be the direct evidence for these particles to be identified as the 5-plet higgs bosons @xmath19 and @xmath20 for the gm model .",
    "finally , we would like to comment on a signal and background simulation of the @xmath142 process with the actual final state such as multi - lepton plus jets at a detector level , which is not performed in this paper . such an analysis is needed to clarify the feasibility of the method proposed in this paper to test the masses of 5-plet higgs bosons , and",
    "that would be best done by the experimental colleagues who have full information about detector design and efficiency .",
    "we studied in this work the phenomenology of exotic higgs bosons in the georgi - machacek ( gm ) model in the environment of the ilc , assuming the colliding energies of 500  gev and 1  tev .",
    "we showed how the decay branching ratios of the three charged states of 5-plet higgs fields depend on the mass difference between the 5-plet and the 3-plet .",
    "it was found that except in the large mass splitting regime , the branching ratios did not change much as the parameter @xmath81 varies from @xmath208 to @xmath209 , except that the @xmath210 decay rates became larger in the latter case .",
    "it was also noted that the @xmath211 decay rates were expected to differ from their sm values due to the participation of the charged higgs bosons in the loop .",
    "we then studied the production of the 5-plet higgs bosons at the ilc , _",
    "i.e. _ , the pair production , the vector boson associated production and the vector boson fusion production at @xmath212  gev and 1 tev . while the pair productions can only be used in the case of @xmath213 , the vector boson associated and vector boson fusion processes are valid even when the mass is larger than @xmath214 . in particular , we found that the vector boson associated production had a bigger cross section than the vector boson fusion processes at @xmath133 gev . for @xmath215  tev , the cross section of the vector boson fusion process is larger than that of the vector boson associated process , especially in the small mass region , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath216  gev , while they become comparable when @xmath217  gev .",
    "we showed explicitly that with a cleaner collider environment , it was easier to determine from various energy and invariant mass distributions of the @xmath218 final state the masses of @xmath98 and @xmath20 with high precision at the ilc than the lhc .",
    "combined with the information of the @xmath10 mass , one would be able to have a comprehensive test of the mass degeneracy within the 5-plet , thereby identifying the gm model .",
    "finally , we discussed how the ilc study of the higgs bosons in the gm model would complement that at the lhc .",
