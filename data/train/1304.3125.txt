    "recently , @xcite conducted a search for debris discs in a sample of 85 m stars using data from the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ) .",
    "they reported a null detection rate , which they attributed to either the different evolution of dust around m stars or to an age effect .",
    "by contrast , debris disc detections are prevalent around a , f and g stars @xcite .",
    "the null result of @xcite motivates a theoretical interpretation in terms of the _ planetesimals _ that are widely believed to reside in these discs @xcite .",
    "the traditional view of debris discs is that they are _ dust _ discs generated by collisions between parent planetesimals , which are much larger in size @xcite . only _ dynamically hot _",
    "discs produce debris discs .",
    "these are discs in which collisions occur and produce enough dust such that the infrared emission associated with the dust grains ( from reprocessing the incident starlight ) exceeds the detection threshold and is hence observable using an infrared telescope . in other words ,",
    "debris discs are the progeny of dynamically hot planetesimal discs .",
    "by contrast , _ dynamically warm _",
    "discs contain planetesimals with smaller sizes and in larger numbers than those found in dynamically hot discs @xcite .",
    "collisions occur frequently between the planetesimals , but they are non - destructive and do not produce dust in any significant amount . however , the planetesimals are small and numerous enough that they provide a non - negligible covering fraction around the star .",
    "it is the planetesimals themselves that reprocess the incident starlight into infrared flux .",
    "in essence , dynamically warm discs may _ mimic _ debris discs , although most of the debris discs observed so far are not believed to be dynamically warm discs .",
    "corvi are known to possess such silicate features , which provides direct evidence for the presence of small dust grains ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "another method is to compare the disc size , inferred from fitting a blackbody to the excess emission , with the actual size if the disc is resolved ; if the resolved size is larger , then small dust grains are likely to be dominating the emission .",
    "yet another test is to determine if the far - infrared and sub - millimetre spectrum of the disk follows a blackbody or exhibits a steeper drop - off due to inefficient emission from small grains , which argues for the presence of a dynamically hot disc . ]",
    "there are two plausible approaches to modeling dynamically hot and warm discs .",
    "the first approach is to construct a formation model , starting from the birth of the gaseous , dusty , protoplanetary disc and ending with a gas - poor disc populated with planetesimals ( and possibly planets ) .",
    "the multitude of poorly - understood processes associated with planet formation renders this a formidable task . parametrizing our ignorance of these processes produces a model with a large number of free parameters .",
    "the second approach is to construct a _ survival _",
    "model @xcite , which addresses the following question : given a planetesimal disc described by a small number of parameters , can it survive a series of dynamical processes that act to destroy it on time scales possibly smaller than its age ?    ) .",
    "for comparison , we include the distances associated with the spitzer 70 @xmath0 m channel .",
    "note that we have assumed @xmath2 in these plots . for small dust grains ( @xmath3 ) , the distances involved are larger and the chances of survival are more favourable ; in this context , these distances are lower limits",
    ". see  [ subsect : ir ] for a discussion of other interpretations when @xmath4 . ]    in the present study , we employ the survival models of @xcite to examine a suite of model discs that are both dynamically hot and warm .",
    "we apply these models to discs around m stars and specialize to the wavebands of wise .",
    "we demonstrate that a possible reason for the dearth of debris discs observed around m stars is because the wise wavebands generally probe semi - major axes @xmath5 au or less ( figure [ fig : mstar ] ) , where dynamical survival conditions are unfavourable for the parent planetesimals in discs to persist for @xmath6 myr or longer .",
    "this interpretation becomes less clear when the associated dust grains or planetesimals deviate from blackbody behaviour or emit at wavelengths longer than 22 @xmath0 m .",
    "we gain further confidence in our interpretation by demonstrating that we can produce infrared excesses for discs around sun - like stars that are broadly consistent with reported values @xcite , as well as obtain model disc solutions for the infrared excesses observed from au mic and gj 581 .",
    "in  [ sect : obs ] , we review the observational constraints . in ",

    "@xcite searched for debris discs at 3.4 @xmath0 m and 12 @xmath0 m around 85 m stars and at 22 @xmath0 m around 84 m stars using data from the wise satellite .",
    "they reported a detection rate of @xmath7 and estimated the detection threshold for the infrared excess to be @xmath80.3 .",
    "we define the infrared excess to be @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the observed flux at a wavelength @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the photospheric flux from the star at the same wavelength ( as given by , e.g. , kurucz models ) .",
    "while no stellar ages are tabulated , @xcite do remark that they expect the majority of the stars in their sample to have ages exceeding 300 myr .",

    "is set by the minimum value of @xmath28 assumed in our monte carlo calculations , but this ultimately does not affect the maximum value of @xmath116 for a given suite of model discs . rather , it is set by the non - erosive condition , which depends on the value of @xmath151 , the binding energy of the planetesimals .",

    "these conclusions are unaffected by the degeneracies involving the non - blackbody behaviour ( or peak versus observed wavelength probed ) of dust grains .",

    ", @xcite previously demonstrated that poynting - robertson drag may be neglected when computing the emission properties of dust grains ( see their ",
    "however , this may not generally be the case for m stars , since @xcite and @xcite have shown that stellar wind drag may dominate over poynting - robertson drag .",
    "this result may be reproduced by examining the efficiency factor describing both types of non - gravitational drag , @xmath164 where @xmath165 is the efficiency factor of poynting - robertson drag .",

    "@xcite showed that collisions generally dominate over poynting - robertson drag .",
    "we now elucidate the conditions under which collisions dominate over stellar wind drag for dust populations around m stars .    denoting the radius of a dust grain by @xmath28 , the time scale for poynting - robertson and stellar - wind drag to act on it is @xcite @xmath176",

    "collisions occur on a time scale of @xmath182 , while stellar wind drag occurs on a time scale of @xmath183 , implying that there is a maximum distance beyond which collisions do not occur fast enough .",

    "these estimates imply that for debris discs that are at least roughly as massive as our asteroid belt , the effects of stellar wind drag may be neglected when they are observed at infrared wavelengths .",
    "more precise constraints may be obtained by examining the values of @xmath187 , also shown in figure [ fig : nongrav ] . to relate these estimates to both the observations of @xcite and @xcite",
    ", we adopt @xmath193 and 22 @xmath0 m , respectively .",

    "@xcite searched for @xmath196 @xmath0 m infrared excesses around 9 m stars , but did not report any detections .",
    "if stellar wind drag is to be invoked as an explanation for these non - detections , the discs around these m stars must have masses lower than the @xmath187 values estimated at @xmath197 @xmath0 m ( even leaving aside the issue that such low - mass discs probably emit infrared radiation below the detection limits ) .    among the ensembles of both debris discs and dynamically warm planetesimal discs simulated by our monte carlo calculations ,",
    "the most massive members are unaffected by stellar wind drag . even considering the wide range of stellar mass loss rates associated with m stars , the discs that are affected by stellar wind drag have low enough masses that they are undetectable using current instrumentation . when stellar wind drag is considered for these low - mass discs , the associated dust grains ( or planetesimals , if considering dynamically warm discs ) become both undetectable and non - existent .",
    "our results in figures [ fig : firmax ] and [ fig : firmax2 ] suggest that m stars with @xmath21 myr are at best marginally detectable by the wise satellite at 22 @xmath0 m , while those with @xmath198 myr should be easily detectable  an age effect .",
    "the caveat to this statement is that the dust grains ( in debris discs ) or planetesimals ( in dynamically warm discs ) either behave like or mimic blackbodies emitting predominantly at the observed wavelength ( see  [ subsect : ir ] for details ) .",
    "conversely , if this caveat was strongly violated , then figures [ fig : firmax ] and [ fig : firmax2 ] predict that debris discs around m stars should be prevalent , a phenomenon that is not observed",
    ". considerations of formation , rather than survival , may further inform this issue .",
    "the ability to compute @xmath116 values that are consistent with the measured ones for the 12 myr - old au mic debris disc further buttresses the suggestion about the non - detections by wise being an age effect .",
