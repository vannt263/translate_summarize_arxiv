    "quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) of light interacting with matter has had great successes and has been tested to a high degree of accuracy . as emphasized not the least by dirac @xcite , feynman @xcite , jaffe @xcite , and many others , it is strange but apparently true that qed on its own is not mathematically consistent because it is not asymptotically free at short distances .",
    "infinite charge and mass renormalizations are required at short distances , ensuring that the resulting perturbed masses and charges agree with observed values . from a fundamental point of view",
    ", qed raises the puzzling questions with regard to the meaning of equations involving infinite constants and mathematically undefined operations of infinite subtractions .",
    "dirac @xcite expresses the point of view that in analogy to the bohr quantum theory , the present day qed formalism will probably be supplanted ultimately by a formalism that will not embody infinite charge and mass renormalizations .",
    "thus the  successes of the renormalization theory would then be seen to be on the same footing as the successes of the bohr orbit theory applied to one - electron problems .",
    "feynman himself , in a book published one year before he died @xcite , described the qed renormalization scheme in less kind words as a hocus pocus ``  process that has prevented the proof that qed is mathematically consistent . in fairness to the memory of feynman , however , it must be pointed out that when he learned that there was no landau pole in qcd , he agreed that unlike qed , qcd is mathematically self - consistent .  perhaps in the hope that mathematicians may , as in times past with earlier problems , be able to rectify by more rigorous treatments on the problems of qed , wightman @xcite and later jaffe @xcite developed and applied the methods of axiomatic field theory .",
    "the conclusion is that lacking asymptotic freedom , it is unlikely that qed could be brought fully into the arena of mathematics''@xcite .",
    "this still leaves however dirac s basic objection related to the appearances of the infinite subtractions .    in the classical theory of electrodynamics ,",
    "the self - energy is infinite for a point particle .",
    "weinberg has pointed out that the infinite classical self - energy for a point particle should be taken as a warning of similar problems to come in the nature of infinity subtractions of the masses and charges for particles in quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "the point nature of particles is therefore intimately related to the infinite self - energy and the question of renormalization .",
    "is it necessary to introduce unknown interactions or unknown electron structure to remove the ambiguities arising from the infinities , as was suggested in early classical models by abraham @xcite and later dirac @xcite , and the axiomatic field theory of wightman @xcite and jaffe @xcite ?",
    "if so , what types of interactions and electron structure will be needed to examine such a problem ?",
    "is it alternatively necessary to bypass the problem of infinite self - energies by postulating fields which only act on other particles and only by action - at - a - distance @xcite ?",
    "one can also avoid classical point - particle mass and charge singularities by using wheeler s geometrodynamical wormhole descriptions of a charge without charge `` and a mass without mass '' @xcite .",
    "rather than focus on theoretical models related to the point - particle nature , we look for observable properties of @xmath3 bound states that may depend on this point - particle property of the constituents .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the concept of an electron point charge has been commonly assumed . from the close agreement of experimental and theoretical electron @xmath4-values , an upper limit for the electron radius of @xmath5 m ,",
    "may be extracted @xcite .",
    "it is reinforced by the absence of a form factor in high - energy electron scattering measurements with an upper limit of the interaction distance scale of order @xmath6 m @xcite , and the small magnitude of the upper limit of the electron dipole moment , @xmath7 @xmath8 cm @xcite .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to examine the consequences of the point electron concept and look for related physical observables that may be probed by experimental measurements .",
    "it is clear that the point charge property has the greatest effects on the interaction between the electron and the positron at short distances . in this regard",
    ", we note that the magnetic hyperfine interaction between the electron and the positron in the @xmath9 state is given by eq .",
    "( 5.73 ) of @xcite , @xmath10 where the magnetic moments @xmath11 of @xmath12 and @xmath13 are related to their spins @xmath14 by @xmath15=@xmath16 . in the spin - singlet @xmath17 state for which both @xmath12@xmath13 and @xmath18@xmath19@xmath20 are negative , the above spin - spin interaction is attractive and singular at short distances and may lead to observable point - charge effects in @xmath3 bound states . the traditional treatment of the above interaction presumes the usual positronium of radius @xmath21 and treats the interaction as a perturbation .",
    "it does not touch upon nonperturbative bound - state effects that can be investigated only by solving the bound - state equation with the inclusion of the spin - spin interaction .",
    "however , the attractive delta - function interaction of eq . ( [ 1a ] ) is too singular to be solved if it is included in the non - relativistic schrdinger equation .",
    "therefore , the presence of the strongly attractive spin - spin interaction in the @xmath17 state necessitates a proper nonperturbative relativistic treatment of the two - body bound - state problem .",
    "the two body dirac equations ( tbde ) of dirac s constraint dynamics have been previously tested and found to be a proper formalism to study relativistic two - body bound states . in qcd , they lead to a good relativistic description of meson spectroscopy in terms of quark - antiquark bound states for both light and heavy mesons @xcite . in qed , they yield not only a perturbative spectra that agree with qed standard results but also distinguish themselves from other bound - state approaches in their ability to reproduce these same spectral results by nonperturbative bound - state methods , both numerically and analytically @xcite .",
    "they give the singular spin - spin interaction of eq .",
    "( [ 1a ] ) in the non - relativistic limit .",
    "it is therefore appropriate to use the tbde to study point - charge effects in @xmath3 bound states .",
    "using the tbde equations , we found point - charge effects which appears as the presence of new positronium bound states , in addition to the usual positronium states @xcite .",
    "their origin was made clear by the schrdinger - like equation that comes from the pauli reduction of the tbde ( see eq .",
    "( [ sle ] ) below ) .",
    "in particular the magnetic spin - spin interaction in the @xmath1 states state refer to those of the @xmath22 wave function in eq .",
    "( [ sle ] ) , a four component subset of the full sixteen component spinor . ] is indeed very attractive at short distances , modified by the relativistic structure of the equations to become less singular in relativistic constraint dynamics than the delta function in the non - relativistic approximation state , see eq .",
    "( 21 ) of @xcite . ] .",
    "however , in the @xmath0 state , the magnetic interaction exactly cancels the very repulsive darwin interaction , resulting in a quasipotential that behaves as @xmath23 near the origin , for point electron and positron .",
    "the bound - state equation then admits two different types of states which we designate as usual and peculiar .",
    "they possess distinctly different properties at short distances .",
    "in particular , the peculiar @xmath1 state , yet to be observed , has a root - mean - square radius of approximately @xmath24 and a rest mass approximately @xmath25 , in contra - distinction from the usual @xmath1 state with a root - mean - square radius of @xmath26 and a mass of approximately @xmath27 .",
    "the existence of the usual and peculiar states for the positronium system poses conceptual and mathematical problems @xcite . if we keep both sets of states in the same hilbert space , then each set is complete by itself , but the two sets of states are not orthogonal to each other .",
    "our system is thus over - complete .",
    "furthermore , the matrix element of the scaled invariant mass operator for these states between states of one type and the states of the other type are not symmetric and thus the invariant mass operator is not self - adjoint .    with the quasipotential @xmath23 at short distances for the @xmath28 state as it has been determined by the tbde constraint dynamics ,",
    "both the usual and peculiar states are physically admissible and there do not appear to be compelling reasons to exclude one of the two sets as being unphysical .",
    "we were therefore motivated to introduce a  peculiarity \" quantum number @xmath29 , such that @xmath30 for usual states that have properties the same as those one usually encounters in qed , and @xmath31 for peculiar states .",
    "the introduction of the peculiarity quantum number enlarged the hilbert space to contain both usual and peculiar states in a complete set and made the mass operator self - adjoint .",
    "it should be emphasized that if the electron is not a point particle , then the peculiar state will not exist .",
    "therefore , an experimental search of the peculiar states can be used to find out whether the electron is a point particle or not .",
    "as the usual @xmath1 state of mass @xmath32@xmath33 lies above the peculiar state of mass @xmath32@xmath25 , the usual @xmath1 state can decay into the peculiar @xmath1 state by a @xmath34@xmath35@xmath34 transition , with the emission of two photons . because such a decay has not yet been observed , it is reasonable to consider the usual @xmath0 state to be predominantly a peculiarity @xmath36=1 state , with a small admixture amplitude @xmath37 of the peculiarity @xmath38=@xmath391 component . through its admixture to the peculiar sector",

    "on the other hand , the failure to find the peculiar state may provide an experimental limit on the point nature of the particles and may stimulate the search for a description of the structure of the electron . a proper description of an electron structure may help resolve the problem of infinite subtractions and infinite renormalization in qed because these large quantities are limited by the length scale of the electron structure .",
