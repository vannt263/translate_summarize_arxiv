    "diffractive vector meson production opens a precious window on the interface between perturbative qcd and hadronic physics . while elastic processes are commonly described through non - perturbative , phenomenological methods , as , for instance , soft pomeron exchange @xcite , hard inclusive reactions ",
    "most prominently deep inelastic lepton scattering  are , in a sense , exactly calculable as a consequence of the qcd factorization theorem .",
    "these two classes of processes now meet at hera .",
    "however , similar to inclusive deep inelastic scattering , also the amplitude for diffractive ( coherent ) production of vector mesons in deep inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering factorizes into a hard part calculable in pqcd convoluted with the non - perturbative off - diagonal gluon distribution in the target @xcite . a rigorous qcd - based proof of the factorization theorem for hard exclusive electroproduction of vector mesons , valid to all orders in perturbation theory , was recently given in ref . @xcite .",
    "this theorem holds if only short distances contribute , which is the case for the production of longitudinally polarized @xmath5 at sufficiently large @xmath6 or heavy flavor photo- and electroproduction @xcite .    for large but non - asymptotic photon virtuality ,",
    "the hard amplitude for exclusive vector meson production is sensitive to the transverse momentum distribution in the light - cone wave function of the @xmath3 leading fock component of the produced vector meson @xcite .",
    "this leads to a suppression of the asymptotic amplitude , i.e. , to an interplay between the quark(antiquark ) momentum distribution in the vector meson and the @xmath6 dependence of the corresponding cross section . that , in turn , allows to extract information on this wave function  and hence on the three dimensional distribution of color in the produced hadron  from the @xmath6 and the @xmath7 dependences of the cross section .    in this work ,",
    "we focus the qcd analysis of refs . @xcite and @xcite on heavy quarkonium ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) photo- and electroproduction .",
    "furthermore , we extend the respective formalism , which in refs . @xcite and",
    "@xcite was applied to the production of longitudinally polarized vector mesons only , to transverse polarizations as well .",
    "the important role the vector meson s @xmath3 light - cone wave function plays in diffractive photo- and electroproduction at non - asymptotic @xmath6 requires a detailed study of this quantity .",
    "motivated by the large value of the quark mass in heavy quarkonia , we start from conventional non - relativistic potential models @xcite and/or a non - relativistic light - front qcd bound state calculation @xcite .",
    "we then critically examine the respective wave functions and confront them with qcd expectations .",
    "in particular for the @xmath0 meson , our numerical analysis yields a significant value for the high momentum component in the respective non - relativistic wave functions @xmath8 .",
    "for instance for the potential model of ref .",
    "@xcite , the region @xmath9 , where the non - relativistic approximation is definitely inadequate , contributes over 30% to the integral @xmath10 .",
    "latter integral appears in the expression for the @xmath11 decay width .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "6 , and it is in line with the qcd prediction of large relativistic corrections to the corresponding bound state equations @xcite .",
    "those large relativistic effects put the validity of a non - relativistic description of @xmath0 mesons  and , in particular , a non - relativistic evaluation of their production in high energy processes  seriously into question .",
    "our analysis shows that the @xmath6 dependence of @xmath0 electroproduction , the photoproduction cross section ratios of @xmath1 and @xmath0 mesons , and modifications in the @xmath7 slope of those cross sections are good probes for the color distribution in the light - cone wave function of the vector mesons as well as the dependence of the parton distribution in the target on the produced meson s transverse size .",
    "in particular , these effects lead to an enhancement of the cross section ratio for diffractive electroproduction of @xmath1 and @xmath0 mesons by a factor @xmath12 for the same @xmath13 as compared to the naive scaling estimate .",
    "this was discussed already in ref .",
    "in addition , if we express the non - relativistic wave functions in terms of light - cone coordinates , we find that they do not display the expected asymptotic behavior @xcite @xmath14 in the vicinity of @xmath15 or @xmath16 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "another mismatch between the non - relativistic and the light - cone approach appears within the evaluation of the @xmath11 decay width .",
    "when @xmath17 is calculated from the non - relativistic wave function @xmath8 , a qcd correction factor , @xmath18 , appears @xcite , which can be numerically large ( @xmath19 for @xmath0 where we use @xmath20 ) while no such term is present in the relation @xcite with the light - cone @xmath3 wave function @xmath21 .",
    "this difference may be important in practice since the schwinger formula for the positronium decay @xcite becomes inaccurate for charmonium where the high momentum component in the wave function is not small . to remedy these deficiencies , we designed an interpolation for the wave function of heavy quarkonia which smoothly matches the wave functions obtained at average inter - quark separations from non - relativistic potential models ( or within a light - front qcd bound state calculation ) with qcd predictions at small distances .",
    "the basic difference of the current work from ref .",
    "@xcite is that the formulae valid in leading order in @xmath22 are derived by decomposing feynman diagrams over the _",

    "note that , due to the difference in the invariant mass between the photon and the vector meson , the light - cone momentum fractions of the gluons in the initial and final state , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , are not the same , and therefore , in principle , an off - diagonal gluon distribution should enter into eqs .",

    "the non - diagonal gluon distribution is shown @xcite to be not far  at the small @xmath13 that are important experimentally  from the diagonal one .",

    "( [ eq7 ] ) will be discussed in more detail later .",
    "it can be seen from fig .",
    "2 that the relevant transverse distances for @xmath5 electroproduction are larger than those characteristic for the longitudinal structure function , i.e. , @xmath99 . therefore , for @xmath5 production , the virtuality @xmath32 that enters in the argument of @xmath100 is smaller than @xmath6 .",
    "we find , to leading order , @xmath101 which , for @xmath5 production , yields @xmath102 .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) is an approximate relation designed to overcome the scale ambiguity which is inherent to leading order calculations .",
    "this  rescaling of hard processes \" effectively relates the scales in different processes via the dominant @xmath103 distances in the respective quark loops .",

    "@xcite . fig .",
    "2 also indicates that the relevant transverse distances are small , and hence the qcd factorization theorem is applicable , for @xmath5 production at large @xmath6 and heavy meson photo- and electroproduction .",
    "the discussion in the above refers to the production of longitudinally polarized vector mesons only . for light vector mesons ,",
    "the formalism at hand can not be extended to transverse polarizations because of the endpoint singularities , i.e. , the contribution from very asymmetric @xmath3 pairs with @xmath105 or @xmath106 , where non - perturbative effects dominate .",
    "for the production of heavy quarkonia @xmath107 , when @xmath108 and @xmath109 however , effects of large transverse distances are strongly suppressed . here , @xmath110 is the radius of the hadron target .",
    "so , the production of transversely polarized heavy quarkonia can be legitimately evaluated using the qcd factorization theorem . at the same time , for @xmath55 the end point contribution ( @xmath105 or @xmath106 ) is enhanced in the amplitude for the diffractive elctroproduction of transversely polarized vector mesons .",
    "thus , the region of applicability of non - relativistic wave function models for heavy quarkonia to the production of transversely polarized vector mesons ( but not of the applicability of the qcd factorization theorem ) is restricted by the kinematical constraint @xmath111 . employing the notations of ref .",

    "in particular , we compare a calculation where the fermi motion corrections were left out ( dotted lines ) , with an evaluation were the latter effects were included while either using just the non - relativistic wave functions ( dashed lines ) or also accounting for the  hard physics \" corrections ( solid lines ) .    as can be seen from fig .",
    "12 , the fermi corrections are necessary to achieve agreement with the data .",
    "however , at this point , the quality of the data is not sufficient to distinguish between the various potential models or to decide whether the  hard physics \" corrections which were imposed on those wave functions at small transverse inter - quark distances ",
    "[ iii.c ]  lead to an improvement .",
    "this should change if the 95 data , which have much better statistics , become available .",
    "the fact that we somewhat underestimate the @xmath0 photoproduction cross section  see fig .",
    "11  and , at the same time , overestimate the @xmath6 dependence of @xmath0 electroproduction  see fig .",
    "12  suggests that our quark motion correction factor @xmath265 of eq .",
    "( [ eqx2 ] ) is too small at @xmath74 and it falls off too quickly at larger @xmath6 .",
    "this implies that the wave functions which we use fall off too slowly in transverse momentum space and they are too steep as a function of the impact parameter @xmath64 , i.e. , the respective @xmath291 is too large .",
    "although the main topic of this work is heavy meson photo- and electroproduction , we still consider an update of our predictions of ref .",
    "@xcite in regards to @xmath5 electroproduction warranted in light of the new data as well as theoretical developments in that realm . currently , absolute cross sections for exclusive @xmath170-meson production are available from nmc @xcite , zeus @xcite , and h1 @xcite , and preliminary results exist from zeus from the 1994 run @xcite . from our predictions for the forward differential cross section , @xmath292 of eq .",
    "( [ eq0c ] ) , the total cross section was calculated using a slope parameter of @xmath293 gev@xmath172 . this is consistent with the values given by the nmc @xcite ( @xmath294 gev@xmath172 ) and zeus @xcite ( @xmath295 gev@xmath172 ) collaborations and slightly smaller than that obtained by h1 @xcite ( @xmath296 gev@xmath172 ) .    to indicate separately the spread that arises from the different available gluon densities and the uncertainty that stems from the various proposed @xmath170-meson wave functions ,",
    "the theoretical predictions are shown for two ( extremal ) gluon densities , grv94(ho ) of ref .",
    "@xcite and mrsr2 of ref .",
    "@xcite , and two different wave functions , termed  soft \" and  hard \" .",
    "the  soft \" wave function refers to a @xmath297 with an average transverse quark momentum of @xmath298 gev@xmath201 as extracted from a qcd sum rule analysis by halperin and zhitnitsky @xcite , and the  hard \" wave function corresponds to a @xmath299 obtained in another qcd sum rule analysis ( for pions ) by lee , hatsuda and miller @xcite . for the latter , @xmath300 gev@xmath201 .",
    "as outlined in detail in the above , the wave function enters through the fermi motion suppression factor , @xmath33 of eq .",
    "( [ eq0d ] ) .",
    "@xmath33 is depicted in fig .",
    "13 for various available @xmath170-meson wave functions :  hard \" and  soft \" were discussed in the above ,  soft@xmath301 \" refers to a duality wave function of the form @xmath302 with @xmath303 gev@xmath201 obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite and used for a similar analysis in @xcite , and ",
    "soft@xmath304 \" labels a two - peak gaussian favored in the analysis of halperin and zhitnitsky @xcite .",
    "note that the latter wave function seems quite extreme as it would correspond to a transverse spread of the @xmath3 component which is larger than the meson s size !",
    "the comparison of our predictions with the most recent experimental data is shown in fig .",
    "14 . in the kinematic domain were our approach is expected to be applicable , @xmath305 and/or @xmath306 gev , our predictions agree with the data within the spread through the various parameterizations for the gluon density and the uncertainty which stems from the vector meson s wave function .",
    "note , in particular , that as @xmath6 increases the energy dependence of the preliminary zeus data @xcite approaches more and more the hard physics limit , @xmath287 , which is very different form the soft pomeron prediction @xcite , @xmath307 .",
    "this could indicate a transition form soft to hard physics in the @xmath6 range depicted in fig .",
    "there are two reasons why our predictions should not really reproduce the data very well at smaller @xmath6 .",
    "firstly , smaller @xmath6 correspond to larger transverse distances , and hence the pqcd approach outlined here loses some of its validity .",
    "secondly , at very small @xmath13 , the increase of these cross sections with energy is restricted by the unitarity of the @xmath308-matrix , and even more stringent restrictions follow from the condition that the leading twist term should be significantly larger than the next to leading twist term @xcite .",
    "the kinematical region where this limit becomes important moves to larger @xmath13 for decreasing @xmath6 .",
    "however , whether the softer energy dependence of the cross sections at the smaller @xmath6 is really due to the unitarity limit slow - down is unclear at the moment .",
    "further work is in progress in that realm @xcite .    the @xmath6 dependence of the cross section is commonly parameterized through a quantity @xmath309 , where ( for fixed @xmath282 ) @xmath310 the various experiments yield @xmath311 @xcite , @xmath312 @xcite and @xmath313 @xcite at @xmath314 gev@xmath201 and @xmath315 gev . neglecting the fermi motion corrections and the  rescaling of hard processes \" ,",
    "our theoretical predictions yield @xmath316 without the corrections , while we find @xmath317 if we take the quark motion and  rescaling of hard processes \" into account . to evaluate the correction factor @xmath33 of eq .",
    "( [ eq13 ] ) , we again used the wave function @xmath318 with an average transverse quark momentum of @xmath298 gev@xmath201 as extracted from a qcd sum rule analysis @xcite . hence ,",
    "our predictions agree with the measurements only if the fermi motion corrections and the  rescaling of hard processes \" are taken into account .",
    "this underlines our claim @xcite that the @xmath6 dependence of those cross sections could eventually be used to probe the transverse momentum distributions within the produced vector mesons .",
    "however , at present , the data are still far too crude to extract conclusive information on this quantity .",
    "note , furthermore , that our prediction refers to the @xmath6 dependence of the longitudinal cross section , @xmath319 , while the experimental values listed in the above correspond to the @xmath6 dependence of the total cross sections , @xmath320 .",
    "in this work , we focused the qcd analysis of refs . @xcite and @xcite on heavy quarkonium ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) photo- and electroproduction , and we extended the respective formalism , which in refs . @xcite and",
    "@xcite was applied to the production of longitudinally polarized vector mesons only , to transverse polarizations as well .    for non - asymptotic momentum transfers ,",
    "the respective hard amplitude is sensitive to the transverse momentum distribution in the @xmath3 light - cone wave function of the leading fock component in the produced vector meson .",
    "this leads to a suppression of the asymptotic predictions , i.e. , to an interplay between the quark(antiquark ) momentum distribution in the vector meson and the @xmath6 dependence of the corresponding cross section .",
    "we derived the respective expressions for the fermi motion suppression factor , @xmath33 of eqs .",
    "( [ eq0 g ] ) and ( [ eq13 ] ) , and the relative enhancement of the transverse cross section , @xmath46 of eqs .",
    "( [ eq0f ] ) and ( [ eq14 ] ) , to leading order in @xmath49 .",
    "the evaluation of these factors required a detailed study of the vector meson s @xmath3 light - cone wave function .",
    "motivated by the large value of the quark mass in heavy quarkonia , we started from conventional non - relativistic potential models , which we critically examined and confronted with qcd expectations .",
    "in particular for the @xmath0 meson , our numerical analysis yields a significant value for the high momentum component in the respective wave functions , visible in the lower part of fig . 5 , and a significant contribution of the  relativistic region \" @xmath321 to the integral @xmath10 , displayed in fig .",
    "this is in line with large relativistic corrections to the corresponding bound state equations @xcite .",
    "these large relativistic effects question the feasibility of a description of heavy meson production in high energy processes based on a non - relativistic ansatz .",
    "this is a very important result which should have consequences far beyond the scope of diffractive vector meson production , and it indicates that the @xmath0 meson is not really a non - relativistic system ! we therefore designed an interpolation for the wave function of heavy quarkonia which smoothly matches the results obtained from non - relativistic potential models with qcd predictions at short distances .",
    "we then used the latter to evaluate the finite @xmath6 corrections for diffractive @xmath0 as well as @xmath1 production .",
    "we find fairly good agreement of our predictions with the @xmath0 data , and we predict a measurable production of @xmath1 mesons at hera  especially after a luminosity upgrade .",
    "we also update our comparison of longitudinal @xmath5 electroproduction with the data , putting special emphasis on preliminary zeus 94 data @xcite that became available only recently .",
    "the discussion in this work affirms that hard diffractive vector meson production is exactly calculable in qcd in the same sense as leading twist deep inelastic processes .",
    "this holds if only short distances contribute , which is the case for heavy flavors or production of longitudinally polarized @xmath5 at large @xmath6 .",
    "the respective amplitude is expressed through the distribution of bare quarks in the vector meson and the gluon distribution in the target .",
    "this is qualitatively different from an application of the constituent quark model to these processes , as in refs . @xcite and @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it makes these processes an ideal laboratory to study the @xmath3 leading fock state in vector mesons .",
