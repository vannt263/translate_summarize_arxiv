    "the advent of terahertz ( thz ) spectroscopy has ushered in a new field of research as scientists seek to exploit the electromagnetic signatures of materials in the thz range of the spectrum . specifically , the ability to perform imaging in the thz would have profound impact on the areas of security@xcite , biology@xcite , and chemistry@xcite .",
    "however , imaging in the terahertz is complicated by the a lack of easily accessible electromagnetic responses from naturally occurring materials .",
    "@xcite    electromagnetic metamaterials ( mms)@xcite are one potential solution to overcoming this",
    " thz gap\"@xcite .",
    "the operational frequency of a given mm design is geometrically scalable to other regimes of the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "various mm structures have been shown to naturally couple to either the electric and / or magnetic components of light in frequency ranges from radio  @xcite , microwave  @xcite , mm - wave  @xcite , thz  @xcite , mir  @xcite , nir  @xcite , to the near optical  @xcite .",
    "a great deal of effort has been exerted to create low - loss metamaterial devices such as negative index ( ni ) structures @xcite and electromagnetic cloaks@xcite .",
    "however , the substantial loss tangent that occurs at the center frequencies of metamaterial resonances can be exploited as well .",
    "this resonant loss phenomenon serves as the starting point for the investigation of mms as narrow - band absorbing elements for thermal imaging devices .",
    "we present the theory , design , fabrication , and measurement of a single - frequency metamaterial absorbing element .",
    "the simulated design reaches a peak absorptivity of @xmath0 at 1.13 thz and the fabricated structure reaches a measured absorptivity of @xmath1 at 1.145 thz .",
    "this absorptivity is comparable to existing mm absorber designs @xcite , but our design is also polarization insensitive , which maximizes the absorption of light .",
    "the absorptivity a(@xmath2 ) of a given material is given by the transmission t(@xmath2 ) and reflectance r(@xmath2 ) as @xmath3 . in terms of the complex transmissivity ( @xmath4 ) and reflectivity ( @xmath5 ) ,",
    "this can be written as @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , @xmath7 when @xmath8 . in reference",
    "@xcite , the frequency - dependent transmissivity @xmath9 was determined to be dependent on the complex index of refraction @xmath10 and impedance @xmath11 for a slab of length @xmath12 as :    @xmath13    where @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the speed of light in vacuum .",
    "we use the convention where a subscripted 1 and 2 denote the real and imaginary parts of a complex function , respectively .    as @xmath16 approaches unity ( the free space value )",
    ", the reflectivity will drop to zero and the transmissivity will be determined entirely by @xmath17 :    @xmath18    upon substitution of the exponential forms this becomes :    @xmath19    so the transmission ( @xmath20 ) is    @xmath21    therefore , as @xmath22 approaches infinity ,    @xmath23    the combined dielectric and magnetic losses in the system are characterized by @xmath22 .",
    "therefore the physical interpretation of the above derivation is that , ( in the absence of reflections ) , the transmission of an electromagnetic wave with a given wavevector @xmath24 through a slab of given thickness @xmath12 is determined entirely by losses in the slab . to create a very high absorber",
    "it is then necessary for @xmath25 at a point where @xmath22 is large .",
    "precise control of @xmath17 and @xmath16 is necessary to realize a high absorber .",
    "electromagnetic mms are prime candidates for this task since they can be designed to couple to electric and magnetic components of light .",
    "this enables precise tuning of the complex , frequency - dependent permittivity @xmath26 and permeability @xmath27 of a mm slab .",
    "the index @xmath17 and impedance @xmath28 are in turn given by @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "mms are typically highly resonant in @xmath31 and / or @xmath32 , where the relevant optical constants approximate the form of a complex oscillator in frequency :    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the oscillator strength , @xmath35 is the damping , @xmath36 is the center frequency of the oscillator , and @xmath37,@xmath38 are high frequency contributions to @xmath39,@xmath40 .",
    "this form for an oscillator describes the frequency response of metamaterials , and we term this a  pendrian \" after ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we consider a single frequency operation point , defined by @xmath36 , such that when @xmath41 then @xmath42=1 and @xmath43 is maximized with a value of :    @xmath44    which , according to eq .",
    "[ matchedt ] , yields    @xmath45    for the more realistic case , when @xmath46 , then @xmath47 and @xmath48 is no longer determined solely by @xmath49 .",
    "however , for large @xmath49 , @xmath50 remains low and @xmath51 can be written approximately in terms of @xmath52 @xcite such that    @xmath53    regardless of @xmath37 and @xmath38 , an optimal narrow - band absorber must maximize @xmath34 with respect to @xmath35 in both @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "@xmath34 is determined by the geometry , filling factor , and conductivity of the two metallizations .",
    "@xmath35 is determined by losses in the metalization and substrate .",
    "the optimal absorber will then use the mm geometries with the maximum possible filling factor .",
    "furthermore , metallization and substrate should be chosen to minimize losses at the operation frequency as determined by eq .",
    "[ n2fgamma ] above .",
    "from a theoretical viewpoint , it would seem simple to design a mm that would provide such a response in @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "however , there are several complications to the theoretical analysis presented above due to the specific properties of mms .",
    "for instance , the periodicity inherent to most mms contributes to spatial dispersion , i.e. @xmath54 and @xmath55.@xcite this spatial dispersion causes the optical parameters to deviate from the pure form of eq .",
    "[ pendrian ] .",
    "spatial dispersion also causes antiresonances in @xmath32 ( @xmath31 ) due to resonances in @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) @xcite .",
    "additionally , conventional electric @xcite and magnetic @xcite mms are highly coupled when they share a center resonant frequency @xcite .",
    "typically , electric metamaterials have higher order electric resonances , and thus in general one does not necessarily have the condition that @xmath56 , leading to a nonzero reflectivity as described above . in our particular case for the design of a narrow - band high absorber ,",
    "a solution to the latter problem was to use two electric resonances ; one to raise and lower the curve at the operational frequency and one to couple to @xmath40 to create a region of high absorption .",
    "[ ptb ]    fig1.eps    the electric responses were provided by a modified electrically coupled ring resonator ( err ) , shown schematically in fig.[fig1](a ) .",
    "the err chosen had fourfold rotational symmetry about the propagation axis and was therefore polarization insensitive @xcite .",
    "the lower - frequency electric response used to tune the @xmath57 curve was driven by the lc loop in the err .",
    "the higher - frequency response used to couple to @xmath57 was created by the dipole - like interaction of the metallizations in adjacent unit cells .",
    "the magnetic response was created by combining the err with a cross structure fig.[fig1](b ) in a parallel structure separated by a layer of benzocyclobutane ( bcb ) fig.[fig1](c ) . the magnetic component * h * of a tem wave coupled to the center stalks of the two metallizations that were perpendicular to the propagation vector , such that anti - parallel currents were driven .",
    "a polarization - sensitive design based on similar parameters has been shown at both thz @xcite and microwave@xcite frequencies",
    ".    practical realization of metamaterials dictates the use of a support substrate that complicates the theoretical optimization of the structure .",
    "this substrate is typically thick in the propagation direction compared to the thickness of the metamaterial and the lateral unit cell dimensions .",
    "this supporting structure introduces ambiguity in the definition of the unit cell as well as significant asymmetry in the propagation direction , both of which complicate the definition of @xmath58 and @xmath59.@xcite however , some portion of the substrate must be included in simulation because it has a measurable effect on the form of the mm resonances due to the dielectric of the substrate , @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "the effect of the substrate on the mm s resonances can be shown directly in simulation .",
    "a parameter sweep of the substrate thickness @xmath12 shows that the effect of the added dielectric on the mm resonance saturates near a value of @xmath61 . for @xmath62 ,",
    "the only added effect is a factor @xmath63 to @xmath9 .",
    "as substrates are typically chosen for low loss in the frequency range of interest , @xmath64 is virtually unchanged and the extended substrate only adds phase . the appropriate unit cell boundary in the propagation direction is therefore given by @xmath65 and the mm elements on the substrate .",
    "the impedance mismatch at the mm - substrate and substrate - air boundaries can then be incorporated into the homogenized effective medium as these boundaries are within the unit cell .",

    "the real and imaginary components @xmath31 and @xmath32 , as plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( a),(c ) , are complicated by the effects of spatial dispersion , as previously mentioned .",
    "however , various features of the plots enable interpretation of the forms of these curves . the lowest frequency feature in @xmath66 at @xmath67 ghz , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](c ) , is the conventional mm elc resonance .",
    "notice this is accompanied by an antiresonance in @xmath27 , which is characterized by a negative imaginary component that peaks at the center frequency of @xmath68 , defined by the cusp near @xmath69 thz , and in accord with previous work@xcite .",
    "a second electric resonance appears at approximately @xmath701.125 thz due to the cut - wire response of the cross .",
    "this is accompanied by an antiresonance in @xmath27 centered at the same frequency .",
    "the resonance in @xmath27 is weak relative to the neighboring resonances in @xmath39 , and thus difficult to observe .",
    "however , @xmath71 has a distinct positive peak at 1.13 thz .",
    "this , combined with an approximately pendrian curve in @xmath72 , indicates the presence of a magnetic response centered a this frequency .",
    "there is also a small but distinct kink in @xmath26 due to the antiresonance caused by the magnetic response .",
    "figure [ fig2](b ) shows the refractive index @xmath73 and ( d ) impedance @xmath74 and demonstrates how close the structure approximates an ideal absorber . at 1.13 thz",
    "the real impedance is near unity , @xmath75 , and the complex impedance @xmath76 is minimized , such that @xmath77 . as desired , the imaginary index , @xmath22 , is maximized near a value of @xmath78 , which minimizes t. this results in a peak absorptivity of @xmath0 , plotted as the green solid curve shown in fig .",
    "the two layer metallization mm absorber sample was fabricated on a high resistivity 1 mm thick silicon substrate .",
    "a 3 um thick sio2 layer was deposited on the si substrate using plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition ( pecvd ) .",
    "the bottom , cross - shaped metallization ( 30 nm ti/40 nm pt/200 nm au ) was patterned using standard negative lithography , metal evaporation , and metal lift - off .",
    "the bcb dielectric ( cyclotene 3022 - 46 , dow ) was deposited using two consecutive spin - coat depositions and soft cures in a vacuum oven , resulting in a final thickness of approximately six microns .",
    "the top elc metallization layer structure and patterning used the same process as that of the cross .",
    "the two unit cells ( one for each layer ) are shown as the insets to the bottom panel of fig.4 .",
    "the mm absorber sample was examined experimentally using a fourier transform infrared ( ftir ) spectrometer .",
    "polarized light from a mercury arc - lamp was transmitted and reflected from both the sample and a reference substrate , and then focused on the detector , a liquid helium cooled si - bolometer .",
    "measurements of the sample for both polarizations where characterized and we found no deviations within experimental error . measured @xmath79 and @xmath80 were used to calculate the experimental @xmath81 .",
    "fabrication tolerances in the structures resulted in some deviation from the theoretically optimized case , and are shown in figure 4 .",
    "the corners of the elc and cross structures are slightly rounded , and the bcb thickness was 6 um rather than the optimal 5.8 um .",
    "all of these factors were incorporated into the computer model and the re - simulated transmission , reflection , and absorbtion for the metamaterial absorber are shown in figure 4 , with the experimental measurement of @xmath79 and @xmath80 . in comparison to the theoretically optimized structure results shown in figure 2 , the fabricated sample exhibits a shift in the mm resonances .",
    "the first transmissive minimum has shifted by 10ghz , while the second minimum has shifted by 54ghz , both to higher frequencies .",
    "the minimum in reflectance has shifted from 1.128 thz to 1.15 thz .",
    "this is expected as electric responses are sensitive to metallic structure rounding @xcite and the thickness of the bcb layer partially determines the magnetic coupling .",
    "however , this change in geometrical parameters does not fully account for the disagreement between figures 2 and 4 .    at 0.5 thz , @xmath79 and @xmath80",
    "are well matched in experiment and simulation , but the forms deviate as the curves approach the mm resonances . specifically , the experimental reflectivity reaches a minimum of only @xmath82 compared to the simulated value of @xmath83 .",
    "likewise , the first and second transmissive minima reach values of @xmath84 and @xmath84 , respectively , as opposed to less than @xmath85 in simulation",
    ". several mechanisms may be behind this disparity .",
    "the off - resonant agreement indicates that the discrepancies are related to resonant forms of the constitutive parameters @xmath31 and @xmath32 . as indicated by eq .",
    "[ n2fgamma ] lowering @xmath34 or increasing @xmath35 of the resonances translates into a higher minimum in @xmath79 as the peak value of the effective loss ( @xmath49 ) is decreased .",
    "this also changes the form of @xmath74 , and therefore the form of @xmath80 .    for both the electric and magnetic resonances ,",
    "@xmath35 is primarily determined by the loss in the bcb substrate between the elc and cross .",
    "previous work has determined that dielectric losses are the primary mechanism , and may be an order of magnitude greater than ohmic loss@xcite . also , because bcb is the primary dielectric that tunes the capacitance of each structure , any deviation from the nominal value of @xmath862.5 will lead to variation in absorbance .",
    "further , it is well known that the dielectric value of many polymer compound have significant dependence on frequency , especially within the thz range@xcite .",
    "as previously mentioned , the  strength of the oscillator \" @xmath34 is determined by the geometry , filling fraction , and conductivity of the two metallizations .",
    "therefore , the deviation of experimental curves in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] may be caused by a combination of increased loss in the bcb and lowered conductivity in the metallizations .",
    "the best fit of simulation to experimental data is shown in figures 4 and 5 .",
    "the loss tangent of bcb was found to be approximately one order of magnitude greater than the nominal value , while the conductivity of gold was found to have decreased an order of magnitude . as a consequence of the non - uniform shift of both the magnetic and electric resonances , as well as",
    "increased damping due to loss , @xmath17 and @xmath28 have deviated from their optimum values , resulting in a peak absorptivity of @xmath87 ( fig .",

    "our device is narrow band .",
    "this enables spectrally - selective applications , such as in the detection of explosives .",
    "however , unlike previous mm absorber designs@xcite , our device is polarization insensitive .",
    "this may be ideal for certain applications , as it maximizes absorption for arbitrarily polarized or incoherent light . as a mm device , our design is geometrically scalable to different frequency ranges .",
    "this scalability is limited only by limitations in fabrication and loss in constituent materials .",
    "the limitations of the narrow band , resonant design could be overcome by using multiple distinct unit cells@xcite or by incorporating tunable or frequency agile metamaterial components @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that designs presented here are bianisotropic - a result of asymmetry in the propagation direction - and belong to shnflies point group @xmath88.@xcite we have performed simulations , ( not shown ) , in order to elucidate the impact of the bianisotropy on absorptive properties of the metamaterial .",
    "we studied the cross polarization in transmission as a function of frequency for the design shown in fig .",
