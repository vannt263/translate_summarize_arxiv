    "the suppression of upsilon @xmath1 states in aa collisions , observed by the star collaboration at rhic  @xcite and by the cms  @xcite and alice  @xcite collaborations at lhc , is one of the most convincing evidence for the creation of the quark gluon plasma .",
    "the precise survival of excited @xmath2 and @xmath3 states vs ground state could even allow to measure the highest temperature reached in those collisions , according for instance to the sequential suppression scenario which is substantiated by calculations of the dissociation temperature based on lattice potentials evaluated at finite temperature . in a previous work  @xcite",
    ", we have addressed the question of upsilon dissociation resorting to a dynamical approach , i.e. the non - linear schroedinger - langevin equation ( sle ) . in this scheme ,",
    "the time - dependent real potential implements the debye - screening while the stochastic forces express the ( hard ) interactions between the qgp and the @xmath4 state .",
    "the sle allows to treat transitions between bound and open quantum states ( the `` suppression '' ) , but also transitions between bound states , a feature usually lacking in other treatments . in a stationary qgp",
    ", sle naturally leads to asymptotic distributions of y(1s ) , y(2s ) , ... following correct statistical weights  @xcite , which allows to make the link with models based on the hypothesis of statistical recombination .",
    "this sanity check is another appealing feature of our approach .    in this work ,",
    "we iterate on our previous predictions @xcite for upsilon suppression in urhic at lhc energy . in order to achieve more reliable comparisons between our model and experimental measurements ,",
    "two improvements were implemented , as described in sections [ section_model ] and [ section_productionpp ] .",
    "as detailed in @xcite , we resort to the so - called schrdinger - langevin equation ( sle ) to deal with the dynamics of the @xmath5 internal state : @xmath6\\,\\psi\\ , \\;\\;{\\rm with}\\;\\ ; \\hat{h}_0 = -\\frac{\\hbar^2 \\delta}{m_b}+v_{\\rm mf}({\\bf x})\\ , . \\label{sleq}\\ ] ] in this equation , the non linear term @xmath7 is a dissipative friction term based on the wave function phase @xmath8 while the term @xmath9 represents stochastic dipolar forces mocking the scatterings on qgp constituents . the hamiltonian @xmath10 encodes the dynamics in the absence of such stochastic interactions with the medium , resorting to the mean field potential @xmath11",
    ".    solving ( [ sleq ] ) in 3 + 1d is still beyond our present implementation of the numerical scheme .",
    "consequently , we adopt a 1 + 1d modeling of the @xmath12 pairs , with even ( resp .",
    "odd ) 1d - states mocking s ( resp .",
    "p ) 3d - states . in vacuum ,",
    "the potential in @xmath10 is taken as @xmath13 , truncated to @xmath14 .",
    "such an approximation was already adopted in @xcite , with ( set i ) @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , following lqcd calculations  @xcite .",
    "the masses of the various upsilon states were found in good agreement with their experimental values but the binding energies a bit too low ( in particular for @xmath3 , whose binding energy was just 20 mev in our model ) . in this work ,",
    "we use slightly different values of the parameters , i.e. ( set ii ) @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , which leads to very good values of the bottomonia masses ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) and even leads to a 3p state ( not found for the set i ) , with @xmath26 . with set",
    "ii , the binding energy of the 3s state is 120  mev , which is the correct value in the vacuum .",
    "the main improvement of this contribution wrt our previous work consists in dealing with the feed - downs . for this purpose ,",
    "we need a fair understanding of the direct production of the various bottomonium states within our scheme , starting from the pp case .",
    "this is not a trivial issue , as the debate between various descriptions ( color evaporation model , color singlet model , color octet model ) is still not settled  @xcite .",
    "our _ bona fide _",
    "prescription is to consider some trial initial state @xmath27 in the singlet representation containing even ( @xmath28 s wave ) and odd ( @xmath28 p wave ) components : @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are free parameters . in pp ,",
    "the direct production of @xmath32 or of @xmath33 is then modeled as @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the eigenstates for @xmath36 . the prompt production",
    "is then obtained from the branching ratios @xmath37 through @xmath38 .",
    "this allows to deduce the various contributions from feed - downs and extract the optimal parameters @xmath31 and @xmath30 by comparison with experimental results  @xcite .",
    "let us insist that this procedure is pretty much specific to quantum treatments while semi - classical modeling like transport equations `` just '' rely on the probabilities and can thus be initiated with the mere numbers extracted from measured @xmath39 .",
    "the extraction of the optimal parameters was made considering the experimental values measured at small @xmath40 which represents the bulk of the production .",
    "for the purpose of illustration we show in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( left ) , the proportion of 1s prompt production stemming from 1p decay , as a function of both parameters . rather unexpectedly , it appears to be possible to reproduce all low-@xmath40 feed - downs ratios with the simple form ( [ eq_init_state ] ) as initial state for @xmath41 and @xmath42 . with these parameters , the absolute ( direct ) weights in 1s , 1p , 2s ,  , 3p are 5.5% , 3.6% , 1.5% , 3.3% , 0.9% and 2.5% respectively",

    "an increase of the feed - down contribution from 1p@xmath43 1s ( lhcb ) as well as the increase of the ( prompt ) @xmath44 ratios ( atlas , cms ) , reaching @xmath45 for @xmath46 which , to our knowledge has not yet been explained on theoretical grounds .     for various @xmath30 values .",

    "[ fig1 ] for the @xmath47 ratio ) which are significantly smaller than the ratios found experimentally at large @xmath40 . as a consequence",
    ", more sophisticated production mechanisms should be investigated and understood in this domain , for which our predictions are thus less robust .",
    "in pbpb collisions , the initial state ( [ eq_init_state ] ) is evolved as in @xcite . the temperature and velocity profile is modeled by epos2  @xcite , which provides good predictions in the soft sector , despite resorting to an ideal fluid dynamics evolution ( this being somehow compensated by broader initial flux tubes ) . in order to model the temperature dependence of the mean - field @xmath50 , we _ bona fide _",

    "we also notice that the s - states benefit from some extra population from the p states during the first fm / c , due to the dipolar nature of the stochastic forces , a feature lacking in @xcite where an initial s - state corresponding to @xmath57 was chosen .",
    "the @xmath40 dependence is found to be mild . in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we show the `` survival '' of @xmath1  i.e. the instantaneous 1s - component of the state relative to the initial one  for various models .",
    "we see that this survival is not much affected by the new set of parameters , neither by the specific wave packet in the initial s wave ( gaussian of 1s - eigenstate ) , while starting from mixed s+p wave packet leads to a larger survival ( of the order of 80% instead of 60% ) , mostly due to the initial p@xmath43 s transitions .     of various bottomonium states as a function of the number of participants in the collision .",

    "we fear we can not conclude on this point without including cold nuclear matter effects and considering auau and uu collisions at rhic as well , what will be done in a future work .",
