    "a metastable configuration of an element , alloy , or compound possesses different , perhaps superior , properties than its stable counterpart . the most spectacular demonstration of such behavior is probably embodied in carbon whose mechanical , thermal , and optical properties vary greatly with the allotropic form  @xcite .",
    "the pressure - temperature phase diagrams of metallic elements , including the technologically important transition metals , are also rich in structural modifications  @xcite .",
    "the properties of these high - pressure or high - temperature bulk phases can , however , not be exploited under equilibrium conditions because the reverse phase transition takes place upon unloading or cooling .",
    "surprisingly , the transition from a high - temperature phase to a low - temperature phase can be suppressed in nanometer - sized materials if the particle size or grain size is smaller than a specific critical value  @xcite .",
    "an intriguing example are tens of nanometers large co nanoparticles stabilized in the fcc phase at ambient conditions while bulk co crystallizes in hexagonal close - packed ( hcp ) structure  @xcite . besides cooling ,",
    "other preparation routes like high - pressure torsion , milling , epitaxial growth , chemical reduction , and microwave irradiation have been proven fruitful to stabilize pure metals in non - equilibrium crystalline phases of their phase diagram ( e.g. , fcc fe nanoparticles  @xcite , fcc co films  @xcite ) or to reveal _ unique _ crystalline phases , i.e. , phases not known from their pressure - temperature phase diagram ( e.g. , nanoparticles of fcc ru  @xcite , fcc zr  @xcite , tetragonal ag  @xcite , fcc hf  @xcite , and bcc co films  @xcite ) .",
    "the common interest that drives current research on such nanostructured materials is related to their potentially shape- or size - enhanced mechanical , magnetic , optical , electronic , or catalytic properties  @xcite .    up to a scale of tens of nanometers , the phase stability of nano - particles is to a large extend dictated by thermodynamic surface properties , in particular by the surface energy  @xcite .",
    "the dependence of phase stability on particle - size was demonstrated for fcc co  @xcite , but recently theory even predicted that bulk fcc co is dynamically stable at 0k and , consequently , corresponds to a metastable bulk phase of co  @xcite .",
    "fcc la was found to be metastable down to very low temperatures in crystals large enough to permit the experimental determination of its phonon dispersion relations  @xcite , which were later confirmed by theory  @xcite .",
    "these examples suggests a connection between non - equilibrium crystal structures observable in nanostructures and a potential isostructural metastable bulk phase .",
    "here , we present the results of a systematic investigation on 24 transition metal elements , that we screened for possible metastable phases by density - functional calculations .",
    "we chose to consider the bct structure space which includes fcc and bcc structures , common to many transition metals , as special cases of higher symmetry .",
    "the findings of this work may encourage experimentalists to prepare metastable phases of the considered elements , e.g. , as thick epitaxial films or as small particles .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : sec .",
    "[ sec : method ] elaborates on our methodological and computational approaches .",
    "in particular , we briefly describe the concept of the epitaxial bain path ( ebp )  @xcite , which we use to indentify possible metastable structures .",
    "criteria for elastic and dynamical stability are briefly reviewed for the sake of a self - contained presentation .",
    "results of the computations are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : res ] and discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : disc ] , which is followed by a short summary .",
    "the bct structure with lattice parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 coincides with the bcc ( fcc ) structure if @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) . this allows to construct homogeneous lattice transformations , referred to as bain transformations , in the space of bct structures passing through the fcc and bcc high symmetry points  @xcite . in general , infinitely many bain transformations can be distinguished embodied in the freedom to define the functional relationship between @xmath2 and @xmath1 . the corresponding path traversing the space spanned by @xmath1 and @xmath2 is referred to as bain path .",
    "the ebp is one possible realization of a bain path , the principles of which were discussed by alippi _",
    "_  @xcite and marcus _ et al . _",
    "the ebp assumes those bct structures for which the lattice parameter @xmath5 is relaxed for every lattice parameter @xmath1 .",
    "hence , the ebp @xmath6 is defined by the minimization of the total energy @xmath7 at fixed @xmath1  @xcite , @xmath8 for the total energy along the ebp we define @xmath9 .",
    "the ebp conditions , i.e. , structural relaxation in the out - of plane direction parallel to @xmath2 and an isotropic distortion of the quadratic basal plane along the in - plane directions , describe the situation met in coherently grown bct films on substrates with four - fold surface symmetry . more specifically ,",
    "the ebp models the interior of the film ( i.e. , the bulk part ) neglecting surface and interface effects except the determination of @xmath1 by coherency with the substrate . for the present purpose , the ebp is a merely technical tool , as a substrate is not necessarily needed to stabilize a phase .",
    "one can imagine to grow the predicted metastable phases by epitaxy , though .",
    "the first important symmetry - dictated demand on the total energy along the ebp arises from the fact that @xmath7 is stationary at points of cubic symmetry  @xcite .",
    "thus , provided that the two points of cubic symmetry belong to the ebp , @xmath10 is not only extremal at these two points but there is at least one additional extremal point with noncubic ( bct ) symmetry  @xcite . in some cases , one of the cubic points does not belong to the ebp but @xmath10 assumes a maximum close to this point  @xcite . in the absence of spin - orbit coupling",
    ", the symmetry property also holds for ferromagnetically ordered states since the magnetization density preserves the full symmetry of the lattice .",
    "second , the ebp is a bain path that passes through global or local minima of the energy @xmath11 by virtue of its definition [ eq .  ] .",
    "the minima of @xmath11 are the minima of the ebp and referred to as tetragonal minima  @xcite .",
    "these minima possess vanishing normal stresses @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 , @xmath15 , are the normal components of the stress tensor and the strain tensor , respectively . although these special unstressed bct states are minima of @xmath11 they are not necessarily stable .",
    "we consider bct states as stable phases , if @xmath10 assumes a global minimum and the phase is known to be the experimental ground state ( e.g. , bcc vanadium or fcc palladium ) .",
    "metastable phases are characterized by @xmath10 at a local minimum and stability against arbitrary small homogeneous lattice distortions and lattice vibrations .",
    "unstable bct states are local minima of @xmath10 which are stable only against homogeneous distortions preserving the bct symmetry .",
    "the present task is to identify those bct minima of @xmath10 which do not coincide with an equilibrium phase and to characterize their vibrational properties .",
    "the conditions for dynamical and elastic stability are discussed in the next section .",

    "a lattice instability associated with an unstable acoustic long - wavelength phonon mode is called elastic instability . in this case , the lattice instability is often related to negative values of an elastic constant ( or combinations thereof ) , see table  [ table : christoffel : bct ] for different high - symmetry branches in the bct structure .",

    "elastic stability in the absence of external forces is defined by a positive definite total energy for any small homogeneous deformation , which implies restrictions on the elastic constants expressed by the born stability criteria ( scs )  @xcite .",
