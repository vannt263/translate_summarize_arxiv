    "in the last decade or so gravitationally lensed qsos , both doubles and quads , have been used mostly for the determination of the hubble parameter ( see @xcite for the latest work , and summary of earlier results ) , and for the estimation of the mass distribution in the lensing galaxies . in this paper",
    "we will concentrate on the latter .",
    "one can loosely divide the information on the lens mass distribution into two categories : radial and angular .",
    "much attention has been paid in the literature to the sky - projected radial mass distribution in lenses because the slope of the density profile , and its variation with radius is a test of cosmological models @xcite .",
    "the density profile slope in the central regions is also important because it is affected by the ( adiabatic ) contraction of dark matter halos in response to the collapsing baryons during galaxy formation @xcite .    the angular distribution of lensing mass , for example , the degree of ellipticity , the change in the ellipticity position angle with radius , etc .",
    "have received some attention as well @xcite , but mostly as `` nuisance '' parameters in determining the radial density profile or the hubble constant .",
    "it is somewhat ironic that the generally uninteresting ellipticity position angle can be unambiguously estimated by any reasonable modeling method , even by eye @xcite , whereas , the more interesting density profile slope is often very uncertain because of the mass - sheet , or steepness degeneracy @xcite .",
    "the positions of lensed images of a quad or a double can also be looked at as consisting of angular and radial information . by radial information",
    "we mean the relative spread of images in distance from the lens center .",
    "the angular information is the angular separation of the images as viewed from the lens center .",
    "for example , in the cloverleaf , h1413 + 117 , and the einstein cross ,",
    "q2237 + 030 any two adjacent images are roughly @xmath7 apart . in doubles ,",
    "the two non - central images tend to be separated by @xmath8 .",
    "obviously there is no simple one - to - one relation between , say , the radial structure of the lensing mass and the radial distribution of lensed images .",
    "however , there are some qualitative connections between the two .",
    "for example , a steep lens mass distribution tends to produce quads with narrow radial spread of images , largely independent of the angular distribution of these images , or the ellipticity of the lensing mass .",
    "conversely , if the lensing mass has a shallow density profile the images tend to have a wider radial spread . in the appendix of this paper",
    "we show that one angular property of the lensing mass , its ellipticity position angle can be straightforwardly and rather precisely estimated from the angular positions of the four images of the quad ( section  [ estimatingpa ] ) .    the main work presented in this paper",
    "is loosely motivated by the preceding paragraph .",
    "specifically , we ask what information about the lensing mass can be retrieved by looking solely at the angular distribution of lensed images around the lens center .",
    "following @xcite , we refer to the four images of a quad by their arrival time , as 1 ,  2 ,  3 ,  4 .",
    "image 1 is the global minimum of the arrival time surface and hence is the first arriving image .",
    "image 2 is the second arriving image , and is also a minimum .",
    "images 3 and 4 are saddles of the arrival time surface .",
    "image 5 , a maximum , is the central demagnified image , and is usually not detected .",
    "( see figure  [ fourpanels ] ) . as explained in @xcite",
    "figuring out the arrival _ order _ of images in observed quads can be done , in most cases , based on the morphology of the image distribution alone , without measuring the time delays .",
    "images 2 and 3 ( minimum and saddle ) often appear close together ; these are the two images that merge and disappear when the source moves away from the lens center . because of that , the angular separation of these two images ( as seen from the lens center ) , which we will call @xmath5 can be a measure of the `` quadrupoleness '' of a quad system .",
    "when 2 and 3 are close together the system is barely a quad , and could have been a double if the source happened to be somewhat further away from the lens center , whereas a quad with images 2 and 3 about @xmath7 apart is a `` well established '' quad .",
    "we also define @xmath9 , as the ray anchored at the lens center that bisects the angle between images 1 and 2 .",
    "if we further specify that @xmath9 points roughly away from image 4 , then the definition of @xmath9 is unambiguous .",
    "similarly , we define @xmath10 as the ray bisecting the angle between images 3 and 4 , and pointing roughly away from image 1 .",
    "the two lower panels in figure  [ fourpanels ] show both these rays for a synthetic mass distribution , whose projected density contours are shown in the upper left panel .",
    "the images are filled circles .",
    "the arrival time surface is shown in the upper right .",
    "the lower left panel shows that the images are found as the intersection of the solution of the lens equation in the @xmath11 and @xmath12 directions , shown by thick ( red ) and thin ( blue ) curves , respectively .",
    "the lower right panel shows the source plane caustics , the source position ( empty green circle ) , and the two bisector rays .",
    "these angles and bisector rays turn out to have some very interesting properties , which relate to certain aspects of the lens mass distributions .",
    "a two - fold symmetric lens is a projected mass distribution that has two orthogonal axes of bilateral symmetry .",
    "a wide class of popular lens models are two - fold symmetric .",
    "for example , this category includes elliptical lenses , with any radial density profile .",
    "the degree of ellipticity can be a function of radius , but the ellipticity position angle ( pa ) should not change with radius .",
    "lenses with single or multiple external shear axes , as long as the shear axes are arranged so as to obey the symmetry , also belong in this category .",
    "two lens classes commonly used for parametric modeling , pseudo isothermal elliptical mass distributions ( piemd ) and pseudo isothermal elliptical potentials ( piep ) @xcite are also members of the two - fold symmetric family of lenses .",
    "we exclude lenses that , even though two - fold symmetric , have wavy isodens .",
    "( isodens are contours of equal projected surface mass density in the lens . ) for example , lenses whose isodens follow @xmath13 , with @xmath14 , or where isodens look like petals . in other words , mass distributions with non - convex isodens are excluded .",
    "this is further discussed in section  [ invariant ] .",
    "the mass distributions thus defined will be referred to as two - fold symmetric .    in this paper",
    "we examine mass distributions through the properties of the quad lenses they generate .",
    "our study is statistical in nature ; we use the properties of the entire quad population produced by a given mass distribution .",
    "insights gained from this study help to draw conclusions from the real data , where a given galaxy lenses one , or maybe a small handful of sources .    in this section",
    "we discuss two - fold symmetric lenses and show that members of this family are indistinguishable when viewed in a diagnostic plane whose axes are certain combinations of image angles .",
    "next , we discuss this diagnostic bisector plane .      the lower right panel of figure  [ fourpanels ] suggests that the axes containing @xmath9 and @xmath10 are good indicators of the orientation of the diamond caustic , and by extension , the pa of the major and minor axes of the lensing mass distribution around the image ring .",
    "this statement is quantified in the appendix ; here we use this observation to motivate our choice of @xmath15 as an angle that contains useful information about the lensing mass .    in the main portion of figure  [ bisector_twofold ] ( upper right panel ) we plot @xmath15 vs. @xmath5 .",
    "each ( red ) dot represents a 4-image lens configuration ( a quad ) ; all the dots arise from the same galaxy , but each dot has a different source position , picked randomly on the source plane .",
    "( sources that do not produce quads did not make it into this plot . )",
    "the galaxy lens used here has an `` isothermal '' projected density profile @xmath16 with a small core to avoid central singularity .",
    "the ellipticity , @xmath17 , is constant with radius .",
    "( the relation between @xmath18 and the axis ratio , @xmath19 is , @xmath20/[1+r]$ ] . )",
    "we call the distribution of points in the @xmath15 vs. @xmath5 plane , the bisector plot . the first thing to note",
    "is that the distribution of points in the bisector plot is not random .",
    "there are no quads with the bisector difference less than @xmath7 .",
    "more interestingly , there is a well defined envelope , a curved line above and to the right of which there are no quads .",
    "we will call this the ` envelope ' .",
    "the bisector plot of figure  [ bisector_twofold ] is flanked by two panels .",
    "the solid line histogram in the left side panel shows the distribution of bisector plot points along the @xmath5 direction ; the @xmath15 values have been `` marginalized '' over .",
    "the solid line histogram in the bottom panel is the distribution of @xmath15 values ; here , the @xmath5 values have been marginalized over .",
    "these two histograms do not fully quantify the distribution of points in the main two - dimensional bisector plot , but they do give us an easy , though incomplete way of examining that distribution .",
    "as an example consider a hypothetical quad lens at ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "when projected on to the two histograms the point falls in the middle of both the distributions .",
    "so , if one is to ask if this point could have been drawn from the two distributions , the answer would be yes in both cases .",
    "however , looking at the full 2-d bisector plane it is obvious that the quad can not be generated by this lens , as it lies above the bounding envelope , well outside the distribution .      in the previous section we looked at the bisector plot of one type of lens , with a certain density profile and certain ellipticity .",
    "we have also generated bisector plots for many types of lenses , with varying density profiles , varying degrees of ellipticity , including ellipticity @xmath22 which changes in radius , lenses with and without external shear , etc .",
    "our numerous experiments suggest that _ all lenses that possess two - fold symmetry , regardless of the radial density distribution and the magnitude or radial dependence of ellipticity and external shear generate the same distribution of points in the bisector plot , bounded by a vertical line and a concave envelope . _",
    "we conclude that all two - fold symmetric lenses , as defined in section  [ deftwofold ] are indistinguishable in the bisector plot .",
    "this is one of the main findings of this paper .",
    "this invariance must derive from the shape of the caustic in the source plane . from our experiments",
    "we have noticed that the inner ( five image ) caustics of all two - fold symmetric lenses are diamond - shaped , and appear to share the following two features .",
    "first , the diamond caustic itself has two - fold symmetry ( and so the two lines connecting the opposite cusps are perpendicular to each other ) , and second , the diamond caustics of any two such lenses can be made to have the same shape if one is allowed to linearly stretch or shrink them in the directions along the lines connecting the opposite cusps . by symmetry arguments ,",
    "the first feature seems natural for lens mass distributions that have two - fold symmetry .",
    "the lines connecting opposite cusps of the diamond caustic of a lens with no such symmetry , for example the one shown in figure  [ fourpanels ] ( lower right panel ) , do not intersect at right angles .",
    "the second feature implies the invariance of the caustic itself ( modulo linear stretching of the @xmath11 or @xmath12 coordinates ) , and is probably the crux of the bisector plot invariance shown in figure  [ bisector_twofold ] .",
    "the invariance does not extend to lenses that have wavy isodens ; such lenses tend to produce caustics more complicated than diamond shapes .",
    "the invariance does not apply to lenses with naked cusps , i.e. lenses whose diamond caustic cusps stick outside of the oval caustic because of large ellipticity in the mass distribution .",
    "the set of quads that delineate the upper bounding envelope of the bisector plane , shown , for example in figure  [ bisector_twofold ] , must correspond to a continuous set of sources in the source plane of any two - fold symmetric lens .",
    "we speculate , and confirm using experiments with synthetic lenses , that the envelope quads , when mapped back to the source plane , form a straight line that connects the center of the lens to the point on the diamond caustic closest to the center ; we call this the point of closest approach , and denote it @xmath23 .",
    "if the bisector plane is indeed universal , as we claim , then the envelope must be described by a universal analytical expression . here",
    "we derive the equation for the envelope for a specific type of a two - fold symmetric lens .",
    "we start with a lensing potential of the form , @xmath24 @xcite , and work in cylindrical coordinates on the plane of the sky .",
    "the arrival time surface is , @xmath25 .",
    "the lensing equation , @xmath26 , in the @xmath27 and @xmath28 directions is written as , @xmath29 using these , the square of the distance of the source from the lens center is , @xmath30 the determinant of the magnification matrix for our lensing potential is , @xmath31 \\label{deta}\\ ] ]    for sources on the caustic , @xmath32 , and so @xmath33 .",
    "the caustic equation becomes @xmath34 the two lensing equations , eq.[lenseq ] can then be rewritten as , @xmath35 equations  [ rs2caus ] and [ lenseqcaus ] make it apparent that the caustic is oval shaped in the plane defined by orthogonal axes equal to the second and first derivatives of @xmath36 with respect to @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "the angle that specifies position in that plane is @xmath38 .",
    "this oval is illustrated in figure  [ oval ] , with filled points , and the right and upper axes .",
    "note that this plane , where the caustic has an oval shape is not same as the source plane . for comparison ,",
    "the caustic in the source plane is also shown in figure  [ oval ] , with empty points , and the left and lower axes . in the source plane",
    "the caustic has the usual diamond shape .",
    "the point of closest approach belongs to the oval and is either on the @xmath39 axis , or on the @xmath40 axis , i.e. either @xmath41 , or @xmath42 , respectively .    to proceed",
    "further we specify the form of @xmath43 , @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are constant for any given lens .",
    "this is the lensing potential of a singular isothermal sphere with an added elliptical perturbation , @xmath46 , which generates shear .",
    "if there were no shear , @xmath45 would be the einstein ring radius of the sis lens .",
    "this sis+elliptical lens model is discussed , for example in @xcite . for this lens , @xmath47 which implies that the point of closest approach corresponds to @xmath42 .",
    "( this is shown as the solid line segment in figure  [ oval ] . ) from the first of equations  [ lenseqcaus ] , and restricting ourselves to the 1st and 4th quadrants ( the other two are redundant because of symmetry ) we derive that @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and so @xmath50 .",
    "here , @xmath37 is the lens plane angle of only one of the images .",
    "@xmath51 is the angle of the point of the closest approach , @xmath23 in the source plane , which is shown as the dashed line segment in figure  [ oval ] ( left and lower axes refer to the source plane ) .    according to our hypothesis all the points defining the bisector plot envelope lie on a straight line",
    "therefore , having found its angle , namely @xmath51 we can now solve for the source positions themselves .",
    "to do this we use the second of equations  [ lenseqcaus ] .",
    "squaring it , and using  @xmath52 we get , @xmath53 ^ 2(1-\\sin 2\\theta ) = \\sin^2 2\\theta \\label{quadratic}\\ ] ] here , @xmath37 refers to any one of four images , two minima and two saddles , and in fact this quadratic equation does have four solutions .",
    "there are two solutions for @xmath54 from the quadratic itself , and each one of these gives two solutions because  @xmath55 .",
    "the two images with @xmath56 are in the 1st and 2nd quadrants , while the other two are in the 3rd and 4th . for each of these two pairs of images their @xmath11-coordinates place them equidistantly on either side of the @xmath12-axis .",
    "this implies that the angular distribution of the four images is symmetric about the @xmath12-axis .",
    "we can take advantage of this in determining how to sort these 4 images in order of arrival time .",
    "first note that images 2 and 3 are interchangeable ; the same is true for images 1 and 4 .",
    "images 2 and 3 are the ones that merge together when the source is on the caustic .",
    "this happens for the largest possible @xmath57 , i.e. @xmath58 . by considering various pairs of adjacent images in turn , one can show that of the 4 images the two that satisfy the merging criterion are the ones with @xmath59 , where @xmath60 , and @xmath61 ^ 2=\\frac{1}{2}[r_s/2b\\gamma]^2 $ ] .",
    "when the source is on the caustic @xmath62 for both of these .",
    "the other two images have to be 1 and 4 .",
    "the angular separation between images 2 and 3 is then @xmath63 .",

    "our quad lenses are taken from the castles data set @xcite .",
    "we used all quads , except , pmnj0134 - 0931 , whose lensing galaxy s position is ambiguous ; b0128 + 437 , whose lens center is unknown ; sdss1406 + 6126 , which has partial data ; and q0047 - 2808 , sdss1029 + 2623 , sdss1402 + 6321 which have no data at all .",
    "we also used two lenses that are not in castles : sdss j125107.57 + 293540.5 @xcite , and he1113 - 0641 @xcite .",
    "cluster lens sdss j1004 + 4112 , with qso image separation of @xmath67 was excluded because the images are formed by the central part of a galaxy cluster , not a galaxy .",
    "the source in b1933 + 503 is a double lobed radio source , whose core and one of the lobes are each lensed into quads .",
    "these two quads were included as two separate lenses .",
    "this gives us a total of 26 quad lenses listed in tables  [ table1 ] and [ table2 ] .",
    "lenses in table  [ table1 ] have unambiguous arrival time ordering of images .    in some cross - like quads",
    "it is hard to know what the correct numbering of images should be . in the most ambiguous cases we can only be certain that images 1 and 2 should lie across from one another , and so should images 3 and 4 . using this as the only rule gives us four distinct @xmath68 pairs .",
    "however , two of these have unrealistically large @xmath5 values , generally in excess of @xmath69 , and can therefore be discarded , leaving us with two possibilities for the @xmath68 pair .",
    "there are 10 ambiguous lenses , and each one generates two lines in table  [ table2 ] .",
    "the quad data is shown in the bisector plot of figure  [ bisector_data ] .",
    "the unambiguous arrival time order lenses are represented by bold star symbols .",
    "each one of the 10 ambiguous time order lenses is represented by two smaller star symbols , connected by a thin line .",
    "it is apparent from figure  [ bisector_data ] that the real quads are not drawn from the quad distribution generated by two - fold symmetric lenses .",
    "this is most clearly seen close to the apex of the bisector plot , near @xmath70 . here ,",
    "nearly all star symbols lie outside of the apex outlined by two - fold symmetric lenses",
    ". the lower portion of the two - fold symmetric lens bisector plot , roughly below @xmath71 also appears to be inconsistent with the observed quad population : the latter are distributed more or less evenly in the region below the envelope , whereas the density of small points ( from two - fold symmetric lenses ) in figure  [ bisector_twofold ] increases sharply as one approaches the envelope from below .",
    "the final major difference is that there is an apparent dearth of real lenses with @xmath72 , which is not reproduced in the two - fold symmetric lenses .",
    "the two solid line histograms in ( the two side panels of ) figure  [ bisector_data ] represent two - fold symmetric lenses , while the histogram delineated with star symbols are the quad data .",
    "the kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test as applied to the @xmath5 distribution states that the real quads could not have been drawn from the two - fold symmetric lenses at 95% confidence level .",
    "the main reason for this is the lack of real quads with @xmath5 around @xmath73 , exactly where the two - fold symmetric lenses predict most of the quads to lie .",
    "the ks test applied to the @xmath74 distribution is far less conclusive , but note that the ks test is not the optimal test here . in section  [ twofold ]",
    "we saw that no strictly two - fold symmetric lens can produce @xmath74 even a degree smaller than @xmath7 .",
    "so the presence of real quads with @xmath75 rules out these lenses .",
    "we conclude that the population of real quads could not have been generated by two - fold symmetric galaxy lenses only .",
    "many lensing galaxies must have more complicated mass distributions .    in the next section",
    "we explore lenses with twisting isodens and lenses with various degrees of substructure . that substructure may be important is already suggested by he0230 .",
    "this lenses image time ordering is unambiguous .",
    "its coordinates in the bisector plot of figure  [ bisector_data ] are at approximately ( @xmath76,@xmath77 ) , quite far above the envelope . according to the arguments of section  [ twofold ]",
    ", the lens mass distribution must deviate strongly from two - fold symmetric . and if fact , looking at the optical image of the lens ( see castles ) it is apparent that in addition to the main lensing galaxy there is a secondary galaxy , located close to image 4 .",
    "the spectroscopic data of @xcite shows that the main lensing galaxy and the smaller secondary one are most probably members of a galaxy group .",
    "a tentative conclusion , to be tested in the next section , is that lens substructure in he0230 and other lenses is responsible for the disagreement between the bisector plots of two - fold symmetric lenses and the real quad population .",
    "this is a large class of lens models , for example , lenses with twisting density contours , lenses with internal and external shear of different amplitudes and pas , lenses with substructure , etc .",
    "many real lenses belong in this vast category .    as a first example we take a synthetic galaxy lens with highly twisting isodens ,",
    "the one shown in figure  [ fourpanels ] , and also in the lower left inset in figure  [ bisectorrt ] .",
    "the thick ( blue ) contour has the surface mass density equal to critical for lensing .",
    "the main portion of the same figure is the bisector plot .",
    "the single peak of figure  [ bisector_twofold ] has now split into two peaks .",
    "the upper right inset in a plain line box shows the source plane caustics .",
    "in contrast to the caustics of two - fold symmetric lenses , this diamond caustic is not two - fold symmetric , for example , the lines connecting its opposite cusps are not perpendicular to each other .",
    "the left and bottom side panels of figure  [ bisectorrt ] show , in bold , the @xmath5 and @xmath15 histograms for this lens . as in the case of two - fold symmetric lenses",
    ", the real quad @xmath5 distribution does not match that of the synthetic lens with twisting isodens , because the latter peaks , instead of dipping around @xmath73 .",
    "the mass distribution of the figure  [ bisectorrt ] lens was not meant to represent any real projected galaxy .",
    "isoden twists in real galaxies result from the projection of intrinsically triaxial galaxies with radially dependent axes ratios . to produce a more realistic isoden twisting",
    "we start with a three dimensional mass distribution given by , @xmath78 where @xmath79 , a parameter proportional to @xmath11 , governs the rate of change of axis ratios with radius .",
    "we used @xmath80 . projecting this triaxial galaxy on to the plane of the sky using euler angles @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 we get the mass map shown in the lower left inset of figure  [ bisectorx1 ] .",
    "the normalization of the mass distribution is such that the thick ( blue ) contour has the critical surface mass density for lensing .",
    "the difference in the pa of the inner and outer isodens is about @xmath84 , consistent with what is observed for nearby galaxies @xcite . for our purposes ,",
    "this synthetic galaxy is a reasonable approximation for a typical projected triaxial galaxy .    sampling the source plane caustic , shown in the upper right inset ,",
    "using randomly placed sources we get the main panel of figure  [ bisectorx1 ] .",
    "this bisector plot looks similar to the one in figure  [ bisectorrt ] , only the separation of the peaks around @xmath85 is smaller . in general , the spread of the peaks is directly related to the degree of isoden twisting in the lens . just as in the case of figure  [ bisectorrt ] , this lens model , and by extension the population of realistic triaxial galaxies can not reproduce the bisector plot distribution of the real quads , primarily because of the dearth of observed quads with @xmath5 near @xmath73 .    before we leave lenses with twisting isodens we note that elliptical lenses with external shear whose axis does not coincide with the pa of the lens produce bisector plots similar to the ones in figures  [ bisectorrt ] and  [ bisectorx1 ] .    next , we turn to lenses with substructure lumps , like secondary or satellite galaxies located close the primary lens galaxy . our goal here is to consider a few representative substructure types . a systematic exploration of the substructure and what matches observations best will be done in a later paper .",
    "figures  [ bisectorr5 ] and [ bisectorr7 ] show results for lenses with one subclump each . in the first case ,",
    "figure  [ bisectorr5 ] , the subclump represents a small perturbation to the lens , so the caustic is only slightly distorted from its two - fold symmetric diamond shape . because the lens is now more complex",
    ", the bisector plot is also more complex .",
    "however , the @xmath5 distribution still does not look like that of the real quads .    in the second case ,",
    "figure  [ bisectorr7 ] , the subclump is compact and relatively more massive . here , the lens @xmath5 distribution ( left side panel ) looks quantitatively different from all the ones we have considered so far ; it is not a single peaked distribution , centered at about @xmath86 .",
    "the main peak has moved to @xmath87 , and there is an incipient second peak close to @xmath88 .",
    "furthermore , the bisector plot points are beginning to extend far above the envelope , almost reaching he0230 , the outlier at ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "perhaps it is not surprising that this lens model ( almost ) reproduces he0230 ; the lens model contains a major secondary perturber , just as the real lens in the he0230 system .",
    "figure  [ bisectorr6 ] shows the results for a lens with two substructure clumps .",
    "the caustic bears no resemblance to a diamond shape , and the bisector plot distribution is very complex .",
    "this lens model reproduces , at least qualitatively , major features of the observed quad distribution in the bisector plane .",
    "note that we did not aim to do so ; no effort was put into matching the observed distribution in any detail .",
    "the dearth of quads at @xmath72 is present in the synthetic lens , and the distribution of points in the bisector plane extends all the way to he0230 , something that even the lens of figure  [ bisectorr7 ] could not do .",
    "figures  [ bisectorx1][bisectorr6 ] are meant only as qualitative guides to different types of non two - fold symmetric lenses .",
    "based on these we tentatively conclude that the real population of quad lenses requires lumpy substructure ; features like twisting isodens and external shear are not enough .",
    "however , a thorough exploration of the parameter space of lenses is needed to make robust conclusions .",
    "this will be the subject of a later paper .",
    "as the source of a quad system moves further away from the lens center images 2 and 3 move closer to each other , and closer to the critical line , and eventually disappear , transforming the lens into a double .",
    "as a quad turns into a double , @xmath90 and the remaining images , 1 and 4 , become the two images of a double .",
    "figure  [ bisector_twofold ] tells us that the largest bisector difference in a quad is @xmath91 . combining this with eq .",
    "[ bisd ] tells us that `` newly formed '' doubles should have @xmath92 , i.e. their image separation should be at least @xmath93 .",
    "so , there should be no doubles with image separation @xmath94 .",
    "if the lens is not two - fold symmetric this limiting angle can change a little .    because doubles have only two images",
    "there is no such thing as a bisector plot for doubles , however , one can make a plot equivalent to the bottom panels of figures  [ bisector_twofold]-[bisectorr6 ] .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ doubles ] .",
    "the thick solid line histograms the angle between the two images of 39 doubles taken from castles . as expected , the angle between the two images generally stays above @xmath91 .",
    "the other four histograms in figure  [ doubles ] represent synthetic lenses .",
    "the two thin solid line histograms correspond to galaxy lenses whose projected density profile is proportional to @xmath95 .",
    "the two dashed histograms represent `` isothermal '' lenses with a small core ; outside the core the projected density scales as @xmath96 .",
    "each one of these density profiles was given two , constant in radius , ellipticities : @xmath97 ( axis ratio , @xmath98 ) and @xmath17 ( axis ratio , @xmath99 ) .",
    "each one of the two shallower lenses were given the same ellipticities .",
    "the ellipticities are labeled in the plot .",
    "all four synthetic lenses are two - fold symmetric , but , in contrast to the quads , the distributions of these lenses in the equivalent @xmath15 are different .",
    "the conclusion we draw is that the distribution of doubles in angles is a more complex function of the galaxy lens parameter that is the case for quads .",
    "a more detailed exploration of the doubles distribution in angles , perhaps coupled to the analysis of the quads , will be a subject of another paper .",
    "we introduce a novel way of analyzing the projected mass distribution in galaxy lenses that relies on the angular distribution of images in quads and doubles around the lens center .",
    "if the images of a quad are numbered in order of arrival , as @xmath0 , through @xmath1 , and @xmath2 is the angle between images @xmath3 and @xmath4 then we define the bisector plane whose axes are linear combinations of @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "we show empirically that all two - fold symmetric lenses with convex isodensity contours are identical when considered in the bisector plane .",
    "we derive an analytical expression for the boundary envelope of the allowed region , for a specific type of lens .",
    "these results concerning the invariance of the bisector plane for two - fold symmetric lenses is one of the main findings of the paper .",
    "it means , for example , that from the point of view of @xmath5 and @xmath6 of quads , a pseudo isothermal elliptical mass distribution is identical to a circular lens , with any density profile plus an external shear .",
    "this invariance of the bisector planes of two - fold symmetric lenses can be used to examine the structure of the real galaxy lenses .",
    "we conclude that the observed quad population was not produced by two - fold symmetric lenses .",
    "we also look at three realistic types of non two - fold symmetric mass distributions , ( 1 ) galaxies with twisting isodensity contours , and elliptical galaxies with external shear axis , ( 2 ) galaxies with single substructure clumps , and ( 3 ) galaxies with two substructure clumps .",
    "it appears that only the last type of lenses is able to reproduce the real quad population .",
    "this of course does not mean that all galaxies with observed quads are of type ( 3 ) , but it does suggest that kpc - scale substructure is a common feature in galaxy lenses .    to confirm and quantify this conclusion a much more detailed exploration of the parameter space of non two - fold symmetric lenses",
    "is needed .",
    "such a study should also include potential sources of bias in the quads .",
    "for example , in this paper we have assumed that the real lenses represent a random sampling of the relevant region in the source plane ; in other words , all sources have the same weights .",
    "this means that we have neglected magnification bias , which makes sources at certain source plane locations more magnified , and hence more likely to enter a magnitude limited sample .",
    "the bias is probably negligible for quads , since they are already highly magnified ; after all , quads are closely related to einstein rings .",
    "it is unlikely that there is a missing population of faint quads .",
    "however , the magnification bias could be an issue for the doubles , and will need to be taken into account in future work .",
    "two final notes are in order .",
    "first , the lumpy substructure we refer to here is different from that searched for using image flux anomalies , e.g. @xcite . in the latter case",
    "substructure lumps are small , and have to lie close to the line of sight to the images .",
    "our substructure lumps are larger , kpc - sized , more extended and can live anywhere within the central several kpc of the galaxy lens center .",
    "second , the varied and complex lumpy substructure that our analysis implies the lenses should have argues strongly for using non - parametric , or semi - parametric modeling techniques .",
    "this work was supported in part by nsf grant ast 03 - 07604 , and hst - ar-10985.01-a .",
    "a given lens system can produce a variety of image configurations , depending on the location of the source .",
    "the four panels of figure  [ bisec ] show the same lens galaxy with four different source positions . as the source location changes the angular positions of the images , and",
    "their angular separation also change considerably .",
    "however , the axis containing the bisector rays @xmath9 and @xmath10 change very little ( i.e. @xmath9 and @xmath10 modulo @xmath100 ) .",
    "furthermore , the axes containing @xmath9 and @xmath10 coincide with the major and minor axes of the diamond caustic , respectively , to within @xmath101 .",
    "figure  [ angles5 ] this observation ; it histograms the angle containing the @xmath9 . because this can be either @xmath9 or @xmath102 the full possible range is @xmath100 .",
    "each point contributing to the histogram represents a random source position .",
    "the thick down - arrow indicates the actual pa of the major axis of the diamond caustic .",
    "this is very nearly the same as the mode ( peak of the histogram ) and the median ( central thin arrow ) of the @xmath9 distribution .",
    "the other two thin arrows mark the 10th and 90th percentiles .",
    "the half - width of the @xmath9 distribution is about @xmath103 , i.e. the axis containing @xmath9 is @xmath104 from the true pa of the major axis of the diamond caustic .",
    "this means that for an unknown position of the source , measuring the axis of @xmath9 and equating it to the axis containing the cusps of the caustic will typically result in a @xmath103 error , or , fractional error of about 4% .    in the absence of strong external shear the direction of the major axis of the diamond caustic",
    "is aligned with the major axis of the mass distribution in the ring of the images .",
    "therefore the pa of the axis containing bisector @xmath9 is aligned with the major axis of the mass distribution at the radius of the images . in",
    "@xcite we noted that the direction of the dominant shear or ellipticity in a lens can be determined from the images : the images lie on an eccentric ellipse whose major axis is perpendicular to the major axis of the dominant shear ( whether it is internal or external ) .",
    "here we suggest a more precise measure of the direction of the mass ellipticity , namely , the axis containing @xmath9 .",
