    "the large - rapidity - gap events , observed in deep inelastic scattering at hera @xcite , are a puzzling phenomenon .",
    "as the data show , the cross section for these ` diffractive ' events is not suppressed at large values of @xmath3 relative to the inclusive cross section , i.e. , these events represent a ` leading twist ' contribution to the inclusive structure function .",
    "however , since the initial proton escapes essentially unscathed , they can not be described by ordinary perturbation theory within the parton model .",
    "one may therefore hope that the study of deep inelastic diffractive processes will lead to a deeper understanding of the interplay between ` soft ' and ` hard ' processes in qcd .",
    "a theory of hard diffractive processes , which does not yet exist , has to provide a clean separation between the perturbative and the non - perturbative aspects of the scattering process .",
    "in particular , it should explain why the large - rapidity - gap events are a ` leading twist ' phenomenon , and it should yield a quantitative description of at least some aspects of the diffractive structure functions . at present the basic mechanism responsible for hard diffraction has not yet been unequivocally identified .",
    "several phenomenological approaches have been developed which may be partially interrelated .",
    "these include the aligned - jet model @xcite ( whose origin dates back before the development of qcd ) , the idea of a ` pomeron ' structure function @xcite , perturbative 2-gluon exchange @xcite and partonic models supplemented by soft colour interactions @xcite .",
    "recently , a semiclassical approach to diffractive deep inelastic scattering has been proposed @xcite . in the proton rest frame",
    "the dominant process is the dissociation of the virtual photon into a quark antiquark pair , and further gluons and quark pairs generated by radiation , which then interact with the proton .",
    "the basic idea of the semiclassical approach is to treat the proton at small values of @xmath4 , where the momentum transfer is generally small , as a classical colour field localized within a radius @xmath7 .",
    "deep inelastic scattering is then viewed as scattering of this system of fast quarks and gluons off the classical colour field . if this system happens to be in a colour singlet state after the interaction one obtains a ` diffractive ' final state with a large rapidity gap between the fast proton and the diffractive hadronic system .",
    "otherwise , an ordinary non - diffractive final state is produced .",
    "in @xcite the dominant contributions to inclusive and diffractive structure functions , due to a virtual quark - antiquark initial state , were calculated .",
    "the results depend on non - perturbative averages over the colour field inside the proton . here",
    "we compute @xmath8-corrections to these results by taking the radiation of a gluon in the initial state into account .",
    "this allows us to discuss the cross section for the production of high-@xmath5 jets .",
    "furthermore , we will clarify the connection of our approach to previous work on pair production in external fields based on light - cone quantization @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .  2 we discuss the applicability of the semiclassical approach to high energy diffractive scattering .",
    "in sect .",
    "3 we then rederive the results obtained in @xcite in a way closely related to the techniques used in @xcite .",
    "this calculation is extended to the case of an initial quark - antiquark - gluon system in sect .  4 with emphasis on the production of high-@xmath5 jets .",
    "our results are summarized in sect .  5 , and some details of the calculations we performed",
    "are explained in the appendices .",
    "the subject of the present paper is the analysis of diffractive deep inelastic scattering in terms of the production of quark - antiquark and quark - antiquark - gluon final states .",
    "these processes are considered in the small-@xmath4 or high - energy limit , where a considerable part of the total @xmath9 cross section is diffractive .",
    "the gluon densities are known to grow rapidly in this small-@xmath4 region .",
    "therefore , as already discussed in @xcite , a description of the proton in terms of a classical colour field should be adequate .",
    "this is closely related to the description of high energy processes in terms of wilson lines , which has been discussed by several authors @xcite . in this section the basis of the semiclassical approach",
    "shall be discussed in more detail .",
    "it is similar to the method developed by balitsky @xcite for small-@xmath4 deep inelastic scattering .",
    "however , in the following more emphasis shall be placed on the connection with the proton wave functional in the schrdinger picture .    to keep the discussion as simple as possible ,",
    "consider first the elastic scattering of a quark off a proton .",
    "although this process is unphysical since quarks are confined , it can serve to illustrate the method of calculation .",
    "therefore , in the following confinement is ignored and quarks are treated as asymptotic states .",
    "the generalization to the physical case of diffractive electroproduction is straightforward and will be discussed subsequently .",

    "in contrast to the quark - proton scattering discussed above , here a colour neutral state is scattered off the proton . therefore no immediate contradiction with colour confinement arises .",
