    "in the sparre anderson model , the ( continuous - time ) surplus process @xmath0 has the form @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the initial surplus , @xmath3 is the premium rate , and @xmath4 is a delayed renewal process generated by a sequence of inter - claim times @xmath5 : @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the sequence of claim sizes ( so that a claim of size @xmath8 is made at time @xmath9 , etc ) .",
    "we assume that the random variables from the above sequences are jointly independent , with @xmath10 and @xmath7 being i.i.d .  sequences .",
    "the goal of the present note is to derive an explicit formula for the distribution of the ruin time @xmath11 in the special case when the @xmath12 s follow the exponential distribution .",
    "when claims occur according to a poisson process and the claim size distribution is exponential , a solution for the distribution of the ruin time @xmath13 has been known for many years .",
    "see , for example , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for different solutions to this problem .",
    "in the recent paper @xcite , the authors used analytical techniques to obtain an explicit formula for the density of @xmath13 in the case when the @xmath14 s have an erlang distribution . in the present note , we present an alternative probabilistic method , which enables one to derive such an explicit formula in the more general case when the @xmath14 s follow an arbitrary distribution .",
    "we assume that the claim sizes @xmath12 follow the exponential distribution with parameter  @xmath15 : @xmath16 while the positive random variables @xmath9 and @xmath17 , @xmath18 have densities @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively . by @xmath21",
    "we denote the convolution of the functions @xmath22 defined on @xmath23 : @xmath24 and by @xmath25 @xmath26 , the @xmath27-fold convolution of @xmath28 with itself .    under the above assumptions ,",
    "the ruin time @xmath13 has a ( defective ) density @xmath29 given by @xmath30\\biggr\\ } , \\label{main}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath31    _ proof_. the idea of the proof is similar to the one used in  @xcite : first we will translate our problem into the problem of the crossing of a linear boundary by the pure jump process @xmath32 and then swap the roles of the time and space coordinates",
    ". then we notice that the generalised inverse of the function @xmath33 is nothing else but the trajectory of a compound poisson process .",
    "eventually , the original problem proves to be equivalent to finding the distribution of the hitting time of a level by a skip - free lvy process , of which the solution is well - known and is given by kendall s identity ( see e.g.  12 , theorem  1 in  @xcite , or @xcite ) .",
    "( i )  we will assume in parts ( i)-(ii ) of the proof that @xmath34 ( which is equivalent to conditioning on @xmath9 , but is more convenient from a notation viewpoint ) .    as we have just said , it is easily seen that , for the pure jump process @xmath35 one has @xmath36 next we ` translate ' the origin to the point @xmath37 and swap the roles of coordinates by introducing the new ` time ' @xmath38 and ` space ' @xmath39 ( where @xmath40 and @xmath41 respectively represent the original time and space ) . in the new system of coordinates , the trajectory of our process",
    "@xmath42 is again a pure step function , which starts at zero at ` time ' @xmath43 and has jumps of sizes @xmath44 at ` times ' @xmath45 due to our assumption  , this will be a trajectory of the compound poisson process @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a poisson process with rate @xmath48 . the distribution of the r.v .",
    "@xmath49 with @xmath50 has an atom @xmath51 at zero and a density on @xmath23 given by @xmath52    to a crossing of the ( lower ) linear boundary @xmath53 by the process @xmath42 at time @xmath13 ( this necessarily is a jump epoch ) there corresponds a ( continuous ) crossing of the ( again lower linear ) boundary @xmath54 by the process @xmath55 at ` time ' @xmath56 , so that @xmath57    finally , we notice that @xmath58 is the crossing time of the ( lower ) level @xmath59 by the process @xmath60 which is clearly a skip - free in the negative direction lvy process .",
    "figure 1 illustrates the translation of the original problem .",
    "the original surplus process starts at level @xmath61 , and ruin occurs at the fifth claim .",
    "rotating the figure anti - clockwise through 90 degrees we see the corresponding path of the pure jump process @xmath62 .",
    "[ fig1 ]    ( ii )  therefore , provided that @xmath63 has a density @xmath64 at the point @xmath65 the crossing ` time ' @xmath58 also has a density @xmath66 at the point @xmath67 , which is given by kendall s identity ( see e.g.  12 , theorem  1 in  @xcite , or @xcite ) : @xmath68 this together with implies that , for @xmath69 the r.v .",
    "@xmath58 has the density @xmath70 therefore , it follows now from   that , given @xmath71 , for @xmath72 the stopping time @xmath13 has a conditional density given by @xmath73    \\(iii ) to obtain the density of @xmath13 in the general case , we observe that @xmath74 always and so , using , @xmath75 f_0 ( v ) dv.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] differentiating both sides and substituting the representation for @xmath76 from yields the density of @xmath13 : @xmath77\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] ( the change of the order of integration / summation is justified as the integrand is a non - negative function ) .",
    "as the last expression is equivalent to the rhs of  , the theorem is proved .",
    "let us first consider the situation where claims occur according to an ordinary renewal process , so that each @xmath14 , @xmath79 has density function @xmath80where @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "it is well known that@xmath83and it is straightforward to show that@xmath84then formula gives@xmath85 in the special case when @xmath27 is a positive integer , we can compute this as @xmath86where @xmath87is the generalised hypergeometric function ( and @xmath88 is pochhammer s symbol ) .",
    "formula follows from the identity @xmath89 which can be derived by applying the multiplication formula of gauss as described in  @xcite .",
    "next , let us consider the special case when @xmath96 , and let us further assume that claims occur according to a stationary renewal process , so that the distribution of @xmath9 is the equilibrium distribution of @xmath97 .",
    "then we find that @xmath98giving @xmath99further,@xmath100giving@xmath101then formula gives      and we can incorporate @xmath103 into the sums so that both start at @xmath104 . for computational purposes we can write this in terms of generalised hypergeometric functions as @xmath105 table [ table1 ] shows some values of finite time ruin probabilities when @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "we use the notation @xmath109 to denote the probability of ruin by time @xmath40 from initial surplus @xmath110 when the density of @xmath111 is given by formula with @xmath96 , and @xmath112 denotes the corresponding probability when the density of @xmath111 is given by formula .",
    "these values have been found by integrating the density functions numerically using mathematica .",
    "we can observe from this table that for each combination of @xmath110 and @xmath40 , the finite time ruin probability is greater when the distribution of @xmath113 is the equilibrium distribution of @xmath114 .",
    "this arises because both the mean and variance of @xmath9 are smaller than the corresponding values for @xmath97 ."
