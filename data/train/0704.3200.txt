    "the investigation of the energy spectra and elemental composition of primary cosmic rays in the knee region ( @xmath0 tev ) remains one of the intriguing problems of modern high energy cosmic - ray physics . despite the fact that these investigations have been carried out for more than half a century , the data on the elemental primary energy spectra at energies @xmath6 tev still need improvement .",
