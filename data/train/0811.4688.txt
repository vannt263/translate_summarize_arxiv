    "single - top quarks are produced via the electroweak interaction and at leading order there are three different production mechanisms ; s - channel , t - channel , and @xmath4-channel , each of which are depicted in figure  [ fig : singletop ] . the theoretical cross sections for the single - top processes are @xmath5",
    "@xcite for the t - channel , @xmath6  @xcite for the s - channel , and @xmath7  @xcite for the @xmath4-channel .",
    "note that each single - top process has a @xmath8 vertex .",
    "only single - top events with an isolated and high-@xmath9 electron or muon in the final state are included in this study since events with only hadrons in the final state are difficult to distinguish from background .",

    "semi - leptonic @xmath10  decay is most likely to mimic single - top events . due to the lack of leptons in the final state , fully - hadronic @xmath10  events are not a major contributor to single - top background .",
    "@xmath13 + jets production constitutes a significant background since the cross - sections for these processes are several orders of magnitude greater than the single - top cross sections .",
    "the background from di - boson events is minimal .",
    "qcd will be estimated by data driven methods and is not considered in these studies .",
    "the amount of qcd contamination depends on the specific selections used in the analyses .",
    "the single - top processes were generated using pythia  @xcite , with the matrix element calculated using acermc  @xcite .",

    "mcfm  @xcite was used to derive the k - factors needed to scale the lo processes calculated with alpgen to nlo .",
    "the three single - top processes shared a common pre - selection . muons and electrons were required to satisfy reconstruction requirements of @xmath14 and @xmath15 and an isolation requirement of @xmath16 in a cone of radius 0.2 around the particle axis .",
    "events were required to contain one muon or electron with @xmath17 and events with secondary leptons were removed to eliminate contamination from di - lepton @xmath10  events and to ensure the orthogonality of the muon and electron samples .",
    "jet candidates were reconstructed using a cone algorithm with @xmath18 and were required to satisfy @xmath19 to be considered a jet . an event was required to have between 2 and 4 jets , with at least two of the jets having @xmath17 and at least one of the jets being @xmath11-tagged .",
    "events were required to have @xmath20 , which corresponds to the energy of the non - detected neutrino present in leptonic @xmath13 decay .",
    "the measurement of the single - top cross sections in the atlas detector  @xcite will be obtained using the formula @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the total number of events in the data , @xmath23 is the number of expected background events , @xmath24 is the selection efficiency for single - top signal events , and @xmath25 is the luminosity .",
    "cross section errors were estimated by randomly generating @xmath22 according to a poisson distribution and randomly varying @xmath23 and @xmath24 for every systematic quantity by an amount determined by a gaussian distribution around the central value of that quantity .",
    "the sources of experimental uncertainty were jet energy scale ( jes ) , @xmath11-tagging likelihood , and luminosity .",
    "the sources of theoretical uncertainties were background cross sections , initial state radiation ( isr ) and final state radiation ( fsr ) , pdfs , and @xmath11 quark fragmentation .",
    "cut - based and multivariate analyses of the cross section measurements were performed for each of the three single - top channels in order to understand the size of the statistical and systematic errors and the amount of integrated luminosity needed to obtain evidence and achieve discovery of the single - top quark . a full description of the single - top analyses can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the cut - based analysis for the t - channel was performed by requiring , in addition to the event pre - selection , a @xmath11-tagged jet with @xmath26 in order to remove low-@xmath9",
    "@xmath13 + jets background and @xmath27 for the hardest light jet to remove @xmath10  contamination . after this selection",
    ", there were 1,460 signal and 3,906 background events for a 1@xmath3  sample .",
    "the quantity of @xmath10  background remaining after the t - channel specific event selection necessitated the use of a boosted decision tree ( bdt ) .",
    "variables providing a good signal to background separation were used as input to the bdt and a cut of 0.6 on the bdt output minimized the total uncertainty on the cross section and corresponded to a signal over background ratio of 1.3 .",
    "the bdt output is shown on the left side of figure  [ fig : t - channel : bdt ] and the leptonic top mass distribution using a cut of 0.6 on the bdt output is shown on the right side of figure  [ fig : t - channel : bdt ] .",

    "the systematic uncertainties far outweigh the statistical uncertainties .",
    "the main systematic uncertainties on the t - channel cross section measurement were jes , isr and fsr , and luminosity .",
    "the systematics achieved using the bdt were approximately half of those obtained with the cut based analysis .",
