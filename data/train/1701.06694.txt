    "al - based alloys are attractive materials for various industrial applications owing to their low density combined with sufficient mechanical strength and ductility .",
    "the severe plastic deformation ( spd ) of metals is a method to improve the mechanical properties of the material via a strong microstructure refinement and the formation of nanostructures @xcite .",
    "equal channel angular pressing ( ecap ) is one such deformation technique beside of high pressure torsion ( hpt ) or accumulative roll bonding ( arb ) that allows producing materials with ultra - fine grain ( ufg ) microstructure and supports industrial up - scaling @xcite .",
    "ecap processing at elevated temperatures was , e.g. , applied to achieve superplastic properties of al - based alloys @xcite .",
    "the material modification via spd processing is not only limited to grain refinement , but also includes modifications of the grain boundary ( gb ) kinetics , structure and segregation @xcite simultaneously with the production of abundant point defects and dislocations in the processed material @xcite .",
    "for example , an enhancement of grain boundary self - diffusion rates by orders of magnitude was established for ecap - processed ni @xcite or ti @xcite , a fact which was unambiguously attributed to a deformation - modified ( in pioneering works termed as `` non - equilibrium '' @xcite ) state of the interfaces due to defect incorporation and enhancement of the excess free volume @xcite . in some cases ,",
    "an extra - ordinary high strength of ufg materials was attributed to specific grain boundary segregations @xcite .",
    "it is well known that beyond a critical strain , a further increase of the applied total strain does not produce further grain refinement , and a saturation of the microstructure modification is observed which corresponds to a balance between the rates of defect generation and their annihilation @xcite . for the given deformation temperature and strain rate , the relative rate of recovery processes will be facilitated in the case of materials with a lower melting point due to a known semi - empirical relationship between the diffusion rates and the melting temperatures of various classes of materials @xcite .",
    "as stated above , the deformation - modified state of grain boundaries was documented for ni and ti with relatively high melting points deformed at room temperature .",
    "does the spd processing of low - melting point materials like al or al - based alloys induce the deformation - modified grain boundaries with enhanced diffusion rates , too ?",
    "cold plastic deformation of al has been shown @xcite to modify the interface structures in pure al by introducing so - called extrinsic grain boundary dislocations .",
    "still these modifications were limited exclusively to special grain boundaries in al , whereas the general high - angle gbs relaxed too fast already at room temperature for any modification to be observed .",
    "addition of mg to al stabilized extrinsic grain boundary dislocations and a deformation - modified state of interfaces was stated to have been observed which then relaxed at elevated temperatures @xcite .",
    "for example , zigzag , highly stepped configurations of grain boundaries in an ufg al3% mg alloy which recovered after irradiation by the electron beam in tem were reported @xcite .",
    "although these observations were discussed in terms of the deformation - modified ( non - equilibrium as it was originally introduced @xcite ) state of the interfaces @xcite , it is known that even well - annealed grain boundaries may also be faceted and dissociated on the atomic scale @xcite .",
    "thus , kinetic measurements would be helpful to elucidate a hypothetical deformation - modified character of the grain boundaries in addition to the microstructure observations .",
    "the present work is focused on studying the effect of severe plastic deformation on the kinetic properties of interfaces in an al - based alloy and contributes to a better understanding of the coupling between the microstructure evolution , precipitate formation and local strain - stress fields as a function of annealing conditions .",
    "for these purposes , the tracer diffusion method is applied to follow the rate of atomic transport , which is extremely sensitive to the state of the grain boundaries , grain boundary segregation and grain boundary precipitation @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0co isotope is chosen as a convenient tracer element and its grain boundary diffusion is measured at about room temperature in al - alloys which were subjected to different heat treatments at elevated temperatures .",
    "thus , the determined diffusion coefficients represent a specific probe of the given grain boundary state on a time scale when bulk diffusion of all substitutional elements in al is frozen and the attained state is not modified during low - temperature diffusion measurements .",
    "a complex al - based aa5024 alloy was chosen for the investigation , with mg , sc , and zr as main alloying components .",
    "sc was added on purpose to facilitate the grain refinement via nano - precipitation @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a strong segregation of mg in this alloy is to be expected , too @xcite . as a result , a sophisticated interplay of hypothetical deformation - induced grain boundary modifications ,",
    "grain boundary segregation and precipitation may be expected .",

    "this is a reasonable asumption , since the strain dependencies in the exponent are more significant than in the prefactor .",

    "co still has a higher coordination ( 11-fold ) than in the saddle point configuration .",
    "this could explain why the latter is comparatively more sensitive to the compressing / stretching ( compressive / dilatational strain ) of the lattice ( see figure  [ fig : diffbarrier]b ) .",
