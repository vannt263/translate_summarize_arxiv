    "the glass transition is still not well understood despite extensive study .",
    "there have been two main theoretical approaches to the problem : dynamic and thermodynamic .",
    "theories in the first category view the glass transition as a kinetic phenomenon characterized by a growing relaxation time and viscosity @xcite . when the relaxation time exceeds the measurement time , particle motion appears to be arrested resulting in the glass transition .",
    "one of the most prominent theories espousing this view is the mode coupling theory ( mct ) in which ideally the relaxation time diverges at a temperature @xmath1 above the experimental glass transition temperature @xcite .",
    "interesting and fruitful concepts such as dynamic inhomogeneities @xcite and the influence of the energy landscape on relaxation processes @xcite have resulted from this approach .",
    "the thermodynamic viewpoint attributes the glass transition to an underlying phase transition hidden from direct experimental observation by extremely long relaxation times @xcite . in most scenarios there is an underlying second order phase transition associated with a growing correlation length which produces diverging relaxation times as well as diverging static susceptiblities @xcite .",
    "more recently mezard and parisi @xcite have argued that the underlying transition is actually a random first order transition signaled by a jump discontinuity in the specific heat .",
    "experimentally the glass transition is characterized by both kinetic and thermodynamic features .",
    "for example in the supercooled liquid kinetic quantities such as the viscosity and relaxation time grow rapidly as the temperature is lowered .",
    "when the system falls out of equilibrium below a certain temperature , thermodynamic quantities exhibit features reflecting the glass transition .",
    "for example as the system is cooled the specific heat has a step  like form and the dielectric constant exhibits a peak at a frequency dependent temperature .    in an effort to better characterize the glass transition we introduce a novel probe which we call a generalized compressibility @xcite .",
    "unlike the specific heat which monitors energy fluctuations , this linear compressibility is a function of the microscopic structure of the system : it depends solely on the positions of the particles and not on their previous history .",
    "since we do not need to compare the system s state at different times , it is not a dynamic or kinetic quantity .",
    "rather it is a thermodynamic quantity in the sense that it is purely a function of the microstate of the system dictated by its location in phase space .",
    "the generalized compressibility is easy to compute numerically , and it is simpler than the dielectric constant which involves both the translation and orientation of electric dipoles .",
    "in addition it does not suffer from finite size effects that can often plague measurements of the ordinary compressibility deduced from simulations .",
    "the generalized compressibility can be calculated in either the canonical or grand canonical ensembles .",
    "in particular it is well defined for a system with fixed volume @xmath2 and particle number @xmath3 in contrast to the ordinary compressibility which is defined for a system that has fluctuations in @xmath3 or @xmath2 .",
    "the generalized compressibility should be directly measurable experimentally in colloidal suspensions of polystyrene spheres @xcite and possibly in other systems as well . in this paper",
    "we present measurements of this quantity in a molecular dynamics simulation of a two component system of soft spheres .",
    "we find that the linear generalized compressibility drops sharply as the temperature decreases below the glass transition temperature @xmath4 .",
    "the drop becomes more and more abrupt as the measurement time increases .",
    "this is consistent with the structural arrest associated with a kinetic transition in which the system falls out of equilibrium .",
    "similar results are seen as the density is increased at fixed temperature .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii describes the molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "section iii describes how the relaxation times and mode coupling @xmath0 are determined .",
    "these are useful for setting the time and temperature scales .",
    "section iv describes our specific heat measurements which show a peak at the glass transition .",
    "section v derives the expressions for the linear and nonlinear generalized compressibilities , and shows our results for these quantities .",
    "the linear generalized compressibility shows an abrupt drop at the same temperature and density as the peak in the specific heat .",
    "section vi compares the ordinary isothermal compressibility with our linear generalized compressibility and shows the advantages of the latter .",
    "section vii gives our results for the diffusion constant .",
    "section viii explains the relation between the linear generalized compressibility and the static structure factor .",
    "finally we summarize our results in section ix . a brief description of some of these results as well as results for a single component fluid that forms a crystal",
    "was reported earlier @xcite .",
    "we have performed a molecular dynamics simulation on a glass forming liquid @xcite consisting of a 50:50 binary mixture of soft spheres in three dimensions .",
    "the two types of spheres , labelled a and b , differ only in their sizes .",
    "the interaction between two particles a distance @xmath5 apart is given by @xmath6 $ ] where the interaction length @xmath7 with @xmath8 ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 a , b ) .",
    "for numerical efficiency , we set the cutoff function @xmath11 with @xmath12 .",
    "the interaction is cutoff at the minimum of the potential @xmath13 .",
    "energy and length are measured in units of @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "temperature is given in units of @xmath16 where @xmath17 is boltzmann s constant , and time is in units of @xmath18 where @xmath19 , the mass of the particles , is set to unity .",
    "the equations of motion were integrated using the leapfrog method @xcite with a time step of 0.005 . during each",
    "run the average density @xmath20 was fixed , and the temperature was kept constant using a constraint algorithm @xcite . the volume @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath22 is the total number of particles .",
    "the system occupies a cube with dimensions ( @xmath23 l/2 , @xmath23 l/2 , @xmath23 l/2 ) and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we have done sweeps of both temperature and density .",
    "we fix the parameters so that crystallization is avoided upon cooling or when the density is increased . for the temperature sweeps",
    ", we fix the density at @xmath24 . for @xmath8 ,",
    "this corresponds to a packing fraction of 1.04 . having a packing fraction larger than 1 means that each particle was interacting with other particles most , if not all , of the time .",
    "our measuring procedure is the following . for runs where we cool the system , we start each run at a high temperature ( t=1.5 ) and lower the temperature in steps of @xmath25 . at each temperature",
    "we equilibrate for @xmath26 molecular dynamics steps ( md steps ) and then measure the quantities of interest for @xmath27 additional md steps where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , or @xmath32 .",
    "all the particles move at each md step .",
    "the results are then averaged over up to 40 different initial conditions ( different initial positions and velocities of the spheres ) .",
    "we have done some runs in which we heat the system of particles by starting at our lowest temperature @xmath33 with a configuration obtained by cooling the system .",
    "we then increased the temperature in steps of @xmath34 .",
    "as before we equilibrate at each temperature for @xmath26 time steps and then measure quantities for an additional @xmath30 time steps .",
    "we have also done some density sweeps in which we fix the temperature ( t=1.0 ) and systematically change the density .",
    "the glass transition occurs as we increase the density .",
    "colloidal experiments often study the glass transition as a function of density .",
    "we start each run at a low density ( @xmath35 ) and increase the density in steps of @xmath36 . at each density",
    "we equilibrate for @xmath26 md steps and then measure the quantities of interest for @xmath27 additional md steps .",
    "the glass transition occurs either as the temperature is lowered or as the density is raised .",
    "it is worth noting that temperature and density can be combined into a dimensionless parameter @xmath37 @xcite : @xmath38 where @xmath39 represents an effective diameter for particles in the mixture .",
    "the concentration of each type of particle is given by @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "for our simulations @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath37 is the relevant parameter when the particles spend most of their time sampling a nonzero interparticle potential , i.e. , for @xmath43 .",
    "thus @xmath37 is particularly useful for interparticle interactions which fall off with distance as a power law and do not have a cutoff beyond which the interaction is zero . when cooling from the liquid phase , the glass transition is known to occur around @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "we have looked for phase separation of the two types of spheres by examining the distribution of large and small spheres in the neighborhood of large spheres and in the neighborhood of small spheres .",
    "we see no evidence for phase separation at either high ( @xmath45 ) or low ( @xmath46 ) temperatures at a density of @xmath47 .",
    "as points of reference for the time and temperature scales , it is useful to find the mode coupling @xmath0 and the @xmath9 relaxation times . we can find the relaxation times using the intermediate scattering function @xmath48 which is a useful probe of the structural relaxation .",
    "it is the spatial fourier transform of the van hove correlation function @xmath49 and the inverse time transform of the dynamic structure factor @xmath50 .",
    "there are two different types of intermediate scattering function : the self ( incoherent ) intermediate scattering function @xmath51 and the full ( coherent ) intermediate scattering function @xmath48 .    in a computer simulation",
    ", the self ( incoherent ) part of the partial intermediate scattering function @xmath52 can be calculated directly using @xcite @xmath53 where the subscript @xmath9 refers to the particle type , a or b. @xmath54 is the position of particle @xmath55 at time @xmath56 , and @xmath57 refers to an average over different configurations .",
    "the wave vector @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a vector of integers . for an isotropic system @xmath52 depends only on the magnitude @xmath60 .",

    "the caging temperature is the highest temperature at which a plateau is present in the intermediate scattering function versus time .",
    "the plateau represents the temporary localization of a particle by a cage of other particles surrounding it .",
    "fig1.eps    mode coupling theory is applicable in the temperature range below the caging temperature and somewhat above the mode coupling @xmath0 .",
    "we define the relaxation time @xmath66 by @xmath67 .",
    "we determine the relaxation times for the seven highest temperatures shown in figure [ fig : selffkt ] and then fit the temperature dependence of @xmath68 to the mode coupling form @xmath69 to find @xmath0 . for the self part of the intermediate scattering function , the actual value of @xmath70 increases as the magnitude of the wave vector decreases @xcite . however , the value of @xmath0 is independent of @xmath71 .",
    "@xmath68 versus temperature and the mode coupling fit are shown in figure [ fig : mct_tau ] .",
    "we find the best fit with the mode coupling temperature @xmath72 which corresponds to @xmath73 .",

    "is the fit to the vogel  fulcher form @xmath74 $ ] with @xmath75 which corresponds to @xmath76 . in doing the vogel  fulcher fit",
    ", we were able to use a much broader range of temperatures since @xmath77 is much lower than the mode coupling @xmath1 .",
    "fig2.eps    the full intermediate scattering function @xmath48 is given by @xcite @xmath78 where the fourier transform of the density @xmath79 .",
    "the subscript @xmath9 refers to the particle type , a or b. the longest @xmath9 relaxation time can be determined from the full intermediate scattering function evaluated at @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "we set @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) which is the location of the first peak in the structure factor for type b particles .",
    "we define the @xmath9 relaxation time @xmath82 as the time where @xmath83 decays to @xmath84 . at a temperature @xmath85 which is just below the mode coupling @xmath0 , we find that @xmath86 has fallen to @xmath84 at @xmath87 md time steps for a system with 512 particles of which half are type b. this gives us a time scale by which to compare other times such as our run times .",
    "this value of @xmath82 shows no signs of aging @xcite and stays about the same even after 10@xmath88 time steps . at higher temperatures this relaxation time is much shorter .",
    "the runs used to determine the intermediate scattering function were done in a slightly different way from the other measurements .",
    "these runs were performed at a given temperature and density for @xmath27 md time steps with no change in temperature or density .",
    "the runs were started from a configuration that had been equilibrated at that temperature and density using parallel tempering .",
    "the parallel tempering technique is described in the appendix .",
    "the specific heat is a thermodynamic quantity which undergoes a change signaling the glass transition . in experimental systems under constant pressure the specific heat exhibits a smooth step down as the temperature is lowered through the glass transition . in our simulations which are done at constant volume , the specific heat has a peak at the glass transition .",
    "it is a useful check of our calculation to see if the peak occurs at the same temperature ( or density ) as the drop in the linear generalized compressibility .",
    "there are two ways to compute the specific heat @xmath89 per particle at constant volume @xmath2 .",
    "the first is by taking a derivative of the average energy @xmath90 per particle with respect to temperature : @xmath91 .",
    "since we study the system at discrete temperatures , we approximate the derivative by a finite difference : @xmath92 where @xmath93 for all integers @xmath94 . the second way to calculate the specific heat is from the fluctuations : @xmath95 where @xmath17 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath96 is the inverse temperature , and @xmath97 is the potential energy per particle . in our three dimensional simulations",
    "the kinetic energy per particle is given by @xmath98 , so it is the fluctuations in the potential energy @xmath97 per particle which determine the temperature dependence of the specific heat .",
    "thus @xmath99 in equilibrium these two ways of calculating the specific heat should agree .",
    "so we compare the results of calculating @xmath89 both ways as a check on our calculation and to make sure the system has equilibrated in all the basins that were visited in the energy landscape .      the specific heat at constant volume exhibits a peak at the glass transition as shown in figure [ fig : sphtfluctdedt ] .",
    "the data in this figure is for 512 particles and was averaged over 6 runs with a measurement time of @xmath31 md steps .",
    "notice that there is good agreement between calculating the specific heat by taking a derivative of the energy with respect to temperature ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : sphtderiv ] ) ) and by using fluctuations ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : sphtfluct ] ) ) .",
    "this implies that the system has equilibrated within the basins that it visits in the energy landscape .",
    "we find similar agreement for other run times . at low temperatures",
    "the specific heat goes to 3@xmath17 as expected for classical oscillators while at high temperatures @xmath89 approaches @xmath100 which corresponds to an ideal gas .",
    "fig3.eps    the peak in the specific heat occurs at @xmath101 which corresponds to @xmath102 .",
    "the temperature of the peak coincides with the mode coupling @xmath103 that we deduced from the intermediate scattering function data .",
    "longer run times lead to a sharper peak in the specific heat as can be seen in figure [ fig : spht_8_time ] which shows the specific heat for 512 particles for several different measuring times .",
    "the peaks would presumably be sharper if we had used a finer temperature scale . at high temperatures",
    "the agreement between the different times is very good .",
    "perera and harrowell @xcite have found a specific heat peak in a two dimensional binary mixture of soft spheres .",
    "they argue that their peak is an equilibrium feature .",
    "however , in our case , at temperatures below the peak , the system has fallen out of equilibrium and has become trapped in a basin in the energy landscape .",
    "we shall see this later by examining the energy of the inherent structures ( potential energy minima ) as a function of temperature .",
    "thus the fact that the peak in the specific heat occurs at or very close to the mode coupling @xmath0 is a result of the relaxation times ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : mct_tau ] ) becoming comparable to and exceeding the simulation run times as the temperature drops below @xmath0 .",
    "when this happens , the system falls out of equilibrium and undergoes a kinetic glass transition .",
    "fig4.eps    the specific heat @xmath104 of experimental systems at constant pressure exhibits a downward step at the glass transition during cooling and a peak at slightly higher temperatures upon heating @xcite . as can be seen in figure [ fig : sphtcoolheat ] , in our warming up simulations , which are done at constant volume , the specific heat peak sharpens and moves toward higher temperatures compared to the cooling runs .",
    "this is consistent with what is seen in experiments .",
    "the hysteresis is consistent with the system falling out of equilibrium and getting stuck in a basin of the energy landscape .",
    "fig5.eps    as we mentioned in the introduction , some have suggested that the glass transition has an underlying second order phase transition @xcite .",
    "unlike typical second order phase transitions , there is no experimental evidence that the specific heat diverges at the glass transition .",
    "this is consistent with our simulations . in simulations",
    "one looks for a divergence by examining whether the quantity increases systematically with system size . in figure",
    "[ fig : sphtsize ] we plot @xmath89 for systems with 64 , 216 , 512 and 1000 particles . as",
    "one can see , the specific heat does not exhibit any size dependence .",
    "however , we can not rule out the possibility that a thermodynamic phase transition occurs at temperatures below where we fall out of equilibrium .",
    "indeed theories which postulate a thermodynamic transition put the transition temperature well below the mode coupling @xmath0 .",
    "fig6.eps      in figure [ fig : sphtdens ] we show the specific heat as a function of density . as the density increases ,",
    "the specific heat rises to a peak at @xmath105 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath106 which is in good agreement with the @xmath37 value of 1.46 that we found for the specific heat peak when we varied the temperature .",
    "going to higher densities corresponds to going to lower temperatures . at",
    "densities higher than 0.8 , the system falls out of equilibrium .",
    "as we mentioned in the introduction , the generalized compressibilities are thermodynamic probes that are a function of the microscopic structure of the system .",
    "they are solely a function of the positions of the particles and do not depend on their histories .",
    "so one could take snapshots of the configurations of the particles at different instances , scramble the order of the snapshots , and still be able to calculate the generalized compressibilities .",
    "averaging over these snapshots corresponds to ensemble averaging . in this sense",
    "the generalized compressibilities are thermodynamic quantities which can be calculated solely from the microstates of the system and do not depend on the system s dynamics or kinetics .",
    "we now derive expressions for the linear and nonlinear generalized compressibility . to probe the density fluctuations , we follow the approach of linear response theory and consider applying an external potential @xmath107 which couples to the local density @xmath108 where @xmath109 denotes the position of the @xmath110 particle .",
    "@xmath111 is the average density .",
    "@xmath112 has units of pressure and sets the magnitude of the perturbation .",
    "@xmath113 is a dimensionless function of position that must be compatible with the periodic boundary conditions imposed on the system , i.e. , it must be continuous across the boundaries , but is otherwise arbitrary .",
    "this adds to the hamiltonian h of the system a term @xmath114 where we have defined @xmath115 .",
    "@xmath116 is the inner product of @xmath117 and @xmath118 , and we can regard it as a projection of the density onto a basis function @xmath119 , i.e. , @xmath120 .",
    "it weights the density fluctuations according to their spatial position .",
    "the application of the external potential will induce an average change @xmath121 in @xmath116 : @xmath122 where the thermal average @xmath123 is given by @xmath124\\quad   \\label{eq : av}\\ ] ] the partition function @xmath125 and @xmath96 is the inverse temperature . for small values of @xmath112 , this change can be calculated using perturbation theory @xcite . up to third order in @xmath112 , we find @xmath126 where the cumulant averages are @xmath127 with the thermal average @xmath128 .",
    "the third order cumulant , eq.([eq : cumu3 ] ) , is zero in the liquid phase because for every configuration there exists an equivalent configuration with the opposite sign of @xmath129 and so we will not consider this term any further .",
    "we can recast eq .",
    "( [ eq : expansion ] ) as a power series in the perturbation @xmath112 : @xmath130 where @xmath131 in this paper we will focus our attention on the linear ( @xmath132 ) and nonlinear ( @xmath133 ) dimensionless generalized compressibilities defined by the above expressions .",
    "we now discuss the choice of the function @xmath117 .",
    "we consider applying the potential along the direction @xmath134 of one of the coordinate axes so that @xmath135 . a natural candidate for @xmath136 is @xmath137 ( no implied sum over repeated indices ) with @xmath138 , where @xmath139 in this case , @xmath116 is the @xmath140 mode of the cosine transform of the density .",
    "we will also consider the simpler function @xmath141 .",
    "the absolute value corresponds to the case where all the particles feel a force along the @xmath134th direction pointing towards the origin .",
    "it gives results very similar to @xmath142 for small @xmath71 at a fraction of the computational cost .",
    "( no sum over repeated indices . )",
    "so our results in this paper correspond to two cases : @xmath143 which is rather like a center of mass , and @xmath144 since the system is isotropic , we compute the compressibilities for each direction and then average over the direction @xmath134 .    in most of our calculations we work in the canonical ensemble where we fix the volume @xmath2 , the number @xmath3 of particles and the density @xmath111 .",
    "however , it is straightforward to generalize our results to the grand canonical ensemble where the number of particles is not fixed .",
    "we simply replace the thermal average defined in equation ( [ eq : av ] ) by @xmath145\\quad \\label{eq : grandcanonicalav}\\ ] ] where @xmath134 is the chemical potential , @xmath146 is the hamiltonian with @xmath3 particles , @xmath147 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : u ] ) for a system with @xmath3 particles , and @xmath148 is the grand canonical partition function given by @xmath149\\ ] ] the generalized compressibilities can be defined using equations ( [ eq : cumu2 ] ) through ( [ eq : susceptibilities ] ) with the thermal averages @xmath128 defined in the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "we now turn to our results for the binary glass forming liquid .      we will first discuss the linear generalized compressibility calculated from the absolute values of the particle positions using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : susceptibilities ] ) and ( [ eq : abs ] ) .    fig8.eps    figure [ fig : glass_lin_susc ] shows the linear generalized compressibility as a function of temperature for different run times .",
    "the compressibility at high temperatures is independent of @xmath150 . in the vicinity of the glass transition",
    "@xmath132 drops .",
    "notice that as the measuring time @xmath151 increases ( and hence as the cooling rate decreases ) , the temperature of the drop decreases and becomes more abrupt .",
    "the measuring time can be thought of as the number of snapshots at a single temperature that we use to calculate the compressibility .",
    "the linear compressibility is proportional to the width of the distribution of @xmath116 , so the drop in @xmath132 corresponds to the sudden narrowing of the distribution @xmath152 . if we regard @xmath116 as a generalized center of mass , then the drop in @xmath132 signals the sudden arrest in the fluctuations of the generalized center of mass . in other words , at the glass transition the motion of the particles is largely frozen and hence , the generalized center of mass does not move around much .",
    "this is consistent with recent observations of the colloidal glass transition in which the size of the clusters of `` fast '' particles drops dramatically at the glass transition @xcite .",
    "notice that at longer measuring times , the temperature @xmath153 at which the generalized linear compressibility drops is roughly at the mode coupling temperature @xmath103 .",
    "let us define @xmath153 as the temperature at which @xmath132 has dropped halfway down . for @xmath30 md steps , @xmath154 ; for @xmath31 md steps , @xmath155 ; and for @xmath32 md steps , @xmath156 .",
    "thus we are able to stay in equilibrium down to the mode coupling temperature for our longer runs .",
    "this is what we would expect when we compare these run times , which are longer than 1 million time steps , to the @xmath9 relaxation time @xmath82 which is about 1 million time steps at @xmath157 which is just below @xmath0 .",
    "thus the fact that the drop in the linear generalized compressibility occurs at or very close to the mode coupling @xmath0 is a result of the relaxation times ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : mct_tau ] ) becoming comparable to and exceeding the simulation run times as the temperature drops below @xmath0 .",
    "when this happens , the system falls out of equilibrium and undergoes a kinetic glass transition .",
    "the behavior exhibited by @xmath158 can be quantified using a scaling ansatz : @xmath159 , where the characteristic time has the volgel  fulcher form @xmath160 .",
    "the inset of figure [ fig : glass_lin_susc ] shows that the data collapse onto a single curve with @xmath161 , @xmath162 .",
    "( the data could not be fitted using @xmath163 as suggested by simple mode coupling theories @xcite . )",
    "notice that @xmath164 lies below the vogel  fulcher temperature @xmath75 and the mct critical temperature @xmath165 deduced by fitting the temperature dependence of the relaxation times .",
    "this scaling suggests that @xmath132 becomes a step function for infinite @xmath151 and that the drop in the compressibility would become a discontinuity at infinitely long times .",
    "this abrupt drop is consistent with a sudden arrest of the motion of the particles in the liquid which is the kinetic view of the glass transition .",
    "the abrupt drop also appears to be in agreement with mezard and parisi s proposal that the glass transition is a first order phase transition with a jump in the specific heat @xcite .",
    "indeed the temperature at which @xmath132 drops agrees with the temperature of the peak in the specific heat shown in figure [ fig : spht_8_time ] .",
    "the specific heat provides an independent check of the glass transition temperature .",
    "however , the drop in @xmath158 and the specific heat peak are due to the system falling out of equilibrium , and therefore we can not really tell if there is an underlying true thermodynamic transition .    one way to see that the system is falling out of equilibrium is to plot the inherent structure energy per particle @xcite .",
    "an inherent structure is a particular system configuration whose energy corresponds to the minimum of a basin in the energy landscape .",
    "the energy landscape is a 3n dimensional surface defined by the potential energy of the system which is a function of the particles coordinates . during each run",
    "we sampled the configurations found at each temperature .",
    "each configuration lies somewhere in a basin and we used the method of conjugate gradients @xcite to find the inherent structure energy of that basin .",
    "the result is shown in figure [ fig : inherent_structure ] where we plot the average inherent structure energies versus the temperature of the configuration that was originally saved . at high temperatures",
    "the inherent structure energy @xmath166 per particle is flat as a function of temperature .",
    "as the system is cooled , @xmath166 decreases rather steeply @xcite .",
    "the inherent structure energy flattens off at low temperatures where the system has fallen out of equilibrium and has become stuck in one basin . for each measuring time",
    "the temperature below which the generalized linear compressibility drops corresponds to the temperature below which the inherent structure energy flattens off at low temperatures .",
    "thus the temperature of the drop in @xmath158 and the peak in the specific heat corresponds to the temperature below which the system falls out of equilibrium and ceases to explore deeper basins of the energy landscape .",
    "fig9.eps    fig10.eps    the behavior of the linear generalized compressibility seen in figure [ fig : glass_lin_susc ] is similar to that seen in measurements of the real part of the frequency dependent dielectric function @xmath167 @xcite . in that case",
    "as the frequency decreased , the temperature of the peak in @xmath167 decreased and the drop in @xmath167 below the peak became more abrupt . by extrapolating their data to @xmath168 ,",
    "menon and nagel @xcite argued that @xmath169 should diverge at the glass transition , signaling a second order phase transition .",
