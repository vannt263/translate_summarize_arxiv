    "magnetoresistance  @xcite , the change of a material s resistivity in the presence of an external magnetic field , has been of interest both as a tool to probe the fundamental properties of an electronic material and for technological applications .",
    "classically , the magnetoresistivity effect depends on both the strength of the magnetic field and the relative direction of the magnetic field with respect to the current due to the lorentz force . for nonmagnetic metals , magnetoresistivity effects at low magnetic fields",
    "are very small , although the effect can become quite large for high magnetic fields .",
    "the magnetoresistance of graphene , a one atom thick layer of carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice  @xcite , in the presence of the in - plane magnetic field has been studied by hwang and das sarma by using the boltzmann approach  @xcite . in the presence of an in - plane magnetic field ,",
    "charge carriers of graphene are spin polarized and the effect of the magnetic vector potential is negligible owing to the one atom thickness of graphene .",
    "the authors showed that the applied magnetic field gives rise to the increase of the resistivity of graphene up to a saturation field where all electrons of the conduction band are spin polarized .",
    "the magnetic field beyond the saturation field excites electrons from the valence band to the conduction band and leads to a negative differential magnetoresistance . in practice",
    ", it is difficult to reach the saturation magnetic field of a graphene layer , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is in units of @xmath2@xmath3 and @xmath4 is scaled by units of tesla . although using the low electron density of graphene is feasible in experiments  @xcite , one has to use an extremely clean and pristine sample to meet the necessary condition in which impurity density is much less than the charge carrier density to avoid any localization regime .",
    "the magnetoresistance properties of a graphene layer are in contrast to those obtained in conventional two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) systems in which the resistivity increases up to a certain magnetic field and then saturates  @xcite .",
    "the magnetoresistance behavior of the 2deg system can be understood by the zeeman coupling and the reduction of screening of charge impurities in a polarized fermi liquid system .    if the magnetic field has a small deviation from the sample plane , in addition to the spin polarization of conduction electrons , it gives rise to the hall effect . tilting the magnetic field",
    "has been shown to be a straightforward tool to disentangled spin and orbit effects in 2deg systems  @xcite .",
    "the longitudinal resistivity and hall coefficient of a conventional 2deg have been investigated experimentally  @xcite and theoretically  @xcite in a slightly tilted magnetic field .",
    "assembling graphene , on the other hand , with various 2d layers into artificial heterostructures to explore novel or tailed properties has been proposed  @xcite and realized in tunneling effect transistors  @xcite .",
    "hybridizing a gapless graphene layer with another gapless graphene layer makes the system a decoupled layer graphene ( dlg )  @xcite where both layers are chiral and differs from a situation in which a gapless graphene is assembled by a 2deg sample ( g-2deg )  @xcite which is a chiral - nonchiral hybrid system .",
    "this structure makes it possible to study transport properties of the graphene layer according to an interlayer electron - electron interaction .",
    "in this paper , we consider a hybrid structure in the presence of a tilted magnetic field to explore the effect of the interlayer interaction on the magnetoresistance properties of the studied layer . the longitudinal resistivity and hall coefficient of the studied graphene layer",
    "are explored and the results are compared with those results obtained for only a single layer graphene in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "we also analyze the dependence of the dielectric material which fills the space between the two layers as well as the distance between layers on the magnetoresistance and hall coefficient and show that the interlayer interaction plays a vital role even at longer distances by using a strong dielectric material between the two layers .",
    "the angle dependence of the hall coefficient is obtained and we show that a quite large hall resistivity occurs in graphene for certain values of the carrier density and screened interaction .",
    "this particular result is in contrast to that obtained in a 2deg system where the hall coefficient increases up to @xmath5 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we describe a model hamiltonian of double layer systems and then derive the conductivity and hall coefficient of the studied layer in a tilted magnetic field .",
    "section  [ sec3 ] is devoted to our numerical results of the longitudinal conductivity and hall coefficient of the studied graphene layer in a hybrid structure .",
    "finally , a brief summary of results is given in sec .",
    "and the second layer ( layer ii ) is either a graphene layer or a 2deg layer which is separated by a distance @xmath6 from the studied graphene layer .",
    "the materials in the hybrid structure are indicated by their dielectric constants .",
    "[ fig : schem ] ]    we consider a double layer structure incorporating a dopped graphene layer ( layer i ) placed on another two - dimensional layer ( layer ii ) with a separate distance @xmath6 .",
    "a schematic of the structure is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schem ] , where layer ii can be a chiral ( another graphene ) layer or a nonchiral ( 2deg ) layer .",
    "we assume each layer is of zero thickness in the direction normal to the plane of the system at zero temperature .",
    "the layers are separated by a dielectric material ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schem ] ) with a dielectric constant @xmath7 and we suppose that the tunneling of electrons between the layers is negligible ; however , the coulomb interlayer interaction plays a role in the system .",
    "the hamiltonian of such a system can be written as  @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 are pseudospin indexes in the @xmath10 and @xmath11 directions , @xmath12 is layer index , @xmath13 m/s is the fermi velocity of graphene and @xmath14 denotes the density operator in layer @xmath15 with the momenta @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath17 denotes the kinetic energy of layer ii which is the same as the dirac equation for a dlg system , while it is @xmath18 in the case of a g-2deg hybrid  @xcite where @xmath19 is the electron band mass .",
    "the last term @xmath20 , refers to the inter- and intralayer electron - electron coulomb interactions that can be obtained by using electrostatic relations for a two parallel conducting systems  @xcite .",

    "[ fig : schem ] .",
    "furthermore , the interaction in layer ii can be obtained by replacing @xmath25 in @xmath26 .",
    "notice that , we are interested in the transport properties of layer i in the presence of layer ii .      applying a tilted magnetic field with a small deviation from the layers plane @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the angle between the plane and the applied magnetic field , has two impacts .",
    "first of all , the parallel component of the magnetic field , @xmath29 gives rise to the spin polarization of carriers in the system and changes the chemical potential by @xmath30 where @xmath31 with @xmath32 being the effective lande @xmath33-factor and @xmath34 is the bohr magneton .",
    "an enhanced @xmath33-factor , @xmath35 for a single and bilayer graphene has been measured  @xcite .",
    "this enhancement is due to the impact of the electron - electron interaction in electronic liquid systems  @xcite .",
    "notice that for @xmath36 , the spin degeneracy is @xmath37 whereas for large @xmath29 , the degeneracy factor is given by @xmath38 and for the intermediate fields , the system is partially spin polarized .",
    "furthermore , the electron density for spin up and spin down are given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the chemical potential , @xmath41 is the valley degeneracy and @xmath42 is @xmath43 . by increasing the magnetic field , the number of electrons with spin up increases and therefore the number of electrons with spin down decreases up to the saturation field , @xmath44 in which @xmath45 . at this field",
    "@xmath46 , thus the saturation field is @xmath47 in which we use @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the fermi energy . therefore , charge densities in term of the magnetic field can be changed and we thus have @xmath50 where @xmath51 , @xmath52 is a kronecker delta and @xmath53 .",
    "accordingly , @xmath29 leads to a decomposition of the conductivity into two different spin dependent channels , namely @xmath54 and @xmath55 and the total conductivity is @xmath56 since the contributions of the spin up and down channels are parallel .",
    "notice that in our study here , there is no mechanism to change spin direction .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the magnetic field also affects the transport properties of layer ii and leads to a change in the electron density distribution . for a dlg system ,",
    "the aforementioned formula remains the same for layer ii with the electron density @xmath57 , since generally , the two layers can have different electron densities . if we consider a 2deg system as layer ii , the magnetic field polarizes the spin of the conduction electron up to a saturation field which is @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the fermi energy of the 2deg layer .",
    "increasing the magnetic field can not excite electrons from the valence band owing to the existence of a large band gap in the dispersion relation of the 2deg system .",
    "therefore , the electron density in such a layer is @xmath60    the second consequence of the tilted magnetic field refers to the perpendicular component in which @xmath61 .",
    "we assume that the field of strength is not strong enough to change the dispersion relation into the landau levels producing the quantum hall conductivity  @xcite and therefore it only results in an ordinary hall conductivity , @xmath62 .",
    "thus the electromagnetic fields , by using semiclassical relations  @xcite , are given by    @xmath63    where @xmath64 , @xmath65 indicates spin up or spin down and @xmath66 denotes the fermi wave vector of @xmath67th spin component with the electron density @xmath68 . by using a current vector such as @xmath69 and the eq .",

    "we thus have @xmath72 in which @xmath73 and @xmath74 now , by considering the electric field , @xmath75 , we calculate the magnetoresistance and hall coefficient expressions as @xmath76    @xmath77 is the longitudinal resistivity and @xmath78 is the hall coefficient which depend on the conductivities of spin up and spin down which will be explored in the next section within the boltzmann approximation .    before describing the boltzmann equation ,",
    "it is worth mentioning that the conductivity of a two - component system can be written as @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the drag conductivity . to calculate the resistivity",
    ", one should take the inverse of the conductivity matrix @xmath81 using the fact that @xmath82 , the resistivity of each layer is obtained as @xmath83 and we therefore define the inverse of the conductivity as the resistivity in both longitudinal and hall conductivities of layer i.      to calculate the conductivity of layer i in which the electron density , @xmath84 is much larger than the concentration of impurities @xmath85 , we therefore can use the boltzmann approach which is based on the relaxation time approximation .",
    "our theory is formulated for weak disorder and we consider only charged impurity scattering without spin - flip processes . in this approach , the conductivity of the system is given by  @xcite @xmath86\\ ] ] where @xmath87 is the fermi distribution function .",
    "at zero temperature , the above equation reduces  @xcite to @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the density of states at the fermi energy and in the case of graphene @xmath90 .",

    "short - range disorder plays a role in resistive scattering at higher carrier density and also high mobility  @xcite , however for mid - range densities , the main scattering source is the charged impurity disorder  @xcite .",
    "we thus neglect all disorder mechanisms other than random charged impurities in the system and assume the charged impurities to be of random negative sign of units of the electron charge .",

    "figure [ fig : rxyg ] shows the behavior of the normalized @xmath208 as a function of the magnetic field for different values of @xmath10 for different systems .",
    "as shown , the hall coefficients have a peak in region @xmath137 which is the same as one gets in a 2deg system however it changes for @xmath209 and the results depend on the value of @xmath10 .",
    "the peak at @xmath209 becomes larger by reducing @xmath57 and increases the interlayer correlation . by increasing @xmath10 value ,",
    "the shape of the hall coefficient changes significantly and decreases rapidly as @xmath10 increases .",
    "contrary to the @xmath77 where the interaction with graphene ( 2deg ) makes lower ( higher ) values of the magnetoresistance of layer i , the interlayer interaction always makes @xmath210 increase compared to its single layer values .",
    "in summary , we calculated the longitudinal resistivity and hall coefficient of the gapless graphene ( layer i ) in a hybrid structure and compared the results with those of a single layer of graphene in the presence of a tilted magnetic field .",
    "we have assumed that the magnetic field is slightly off the electronic planes so that there is a weak perpendicular component .    for a parallel magnetic field , @xmath126",
    "we have analyzed the dependence of the dielectric material which fills the space between the two layers as well as the distance between the layers on the magnetoresistances of layer i and shown that the interlayer interaction plays an important role even at longer distances by using large values of the dielectric constant .",
    "our numerical results show that the resistivity of layer i is significantly modified when @xmath131 .",
    "moreover , the resistivity shows a negative differential magnetoresistance for a small @xmath6 and for a region in which @xmath29 is much smaller than the saturation magnetic field .",
    "we have also obtained the reduction of the resistivity when the dielectric constant between two layers increases and obtained the negative differential magnetoresistance in the area where @xmath211 due to the correlation effects induced on layer i from another layer .",
    "we have shown that the @xmath77 in a g-2deg structure decreases at a small @xmath6 , behaves nonmonotonically as a function of @xmath6 and the results show in different trend as compared to those in dlg systems .    in the presence of a tilted magnetic field , @xmath129 , the hall coefficient of layer i shows two peaks at finite @xmath10 values",
    "in which one peak occurs just below the @xmath44 value and another takes place above that .",
    "these peaks become sharper at very small @xmath10 values . accordingly , a giant like hall coefficient behavior for layer i can be reached in a hybrid graphene structure .",
    "we have shown that the magnetoresistance and the hall coefficient of a doped graphene layer can be tuned by the electron density and dielectric constants of the materials in a hybrid structure .",
    "our results should be verified by experiments .",
