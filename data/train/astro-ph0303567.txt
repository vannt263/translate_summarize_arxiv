    "it is widely accepted that molecular outflows take place during low - mass protostellar formation .",
    "the origin of molecular outflows is still debatable , whereas recent observational and theoretical studies have suggested that high - velocity neutral jets from the vicinity of protostars drive molecular outflows by entraining the material along the jet path @xcite .",
    "those jets could cause shocks and alter the physical and chemical conditions of the entrained material drastically .",
    "in fact , there is observational evidence of such shocks from some class 0 sources , such as l1157 @xcite , ngc 1333 iras 2 @xcite , iras 4 @xcite , iras 16293 - 2422 @xcite , l1448 @xcite , hh25mms @xcite , and bhr71 @xcite .",
    "these sources show that , in the positions where jets hit and entrain the ambient dense gas , molecular lines such as sio , so , cs , and ch@xmath0oh are much more intense than those in the positions of the protostars .",
    "these results have been interpreted as the case where molecules on dust grains evaporate into gas phase through the c - type shock heating or sputtering due to the interaction with jets , resulting in enormous abundance enhancement of these molecules @xcite .",
    "however , studies of the interaction between outflows and parent cloud cores have been so far limited to some representative sources with strong shocks like those mentioned above .",
    "hence , we do not know how ubiquitous and how important the interaction between outflows and cores is in the process of low - mass star formation .",
    "for example , there is no thorough observational studies on this issue in the taurus molecular cloud complex , even though it is one of the nearest ( 140 pc ; elias 1978 ) and the most representative low - mass star - forming regions .",
    "iram 04191 + 1522 ( hereafter referred to as iram 04191 ) is a class 0 protostar , recently discovered by andr et al .",
    "( 1999a ) in the southern part of the taurus molecular cloud .",
    "this source , with a very low bolometric temperature ( t@xmath10 ) of @xmath7 18 k , is located at @xmath7 1@xmath11 southwest of the class i infrared source iras 04191 + 1523 ( not to be confused with iram 04191 ) , and is considered to be one of the youngest protostars among the known class 0 objects @xcite .",
    "iram 04191 is associated with a well - collimated molecular outflow that extends from northeast ( red ) to southwest ( blue ) @xcite . since such an extremely young protostar",
    "should be surrounded by a plenty of material which is less disrupted by the associated outflow , we may expect a more clear case of the interaction between the outflow and the surrounding material .",
    "in fact , belloche et al . (",
    "2002 ) have recently found evidence of such an interaction toward the blue lobe of the molecular outflow in the cs(21 ) line .",
    "it is therefore quite interesting to study the interaction between the outflow and the core toward this very young protostar in detail .",
    "we adopted a band of ch@xmath0oh ( @xmath1=2@xmath21@xmath2 ) lines @xcite as a probe to study interaction between the outflow and the parent cloud core associated with iram 04191 .",
    "as mentioned above , the ch@xmath0oh line can be a good tracer of shock interaction , since ch@xmath0oh molecules on dust grains evaporate into gas phase by mean of shock heating and the abundance is greatly enhanced toward those interaction regions @xcite .",
    "in addition to the ch@xmath0oh lines , the c@xmath3s ( @xmath4=21 ) line , the enhancement of which is also observed in some sources with outflow - core interaction @xcite , was observed simultaneously .",
    "belloche et al .",
    "( 2002 ) also observed c@xmath3s ( @xmath4=21 ) as well as the main isotope in iram04191 .",
    "we carried out mapping observations of the ch@xmath0oh ( @xmath12=2@xmath21@xmath2 ) and c@xmath3s ( @xmath4=21 ) lines with the 45 m telescope at nobeyama radio observatory from the 8th to the 11th of january , 2000 .",
    "the mapping observations have been performed at a grid spacing of 20@xmath13 and a position angle of 30@xmath14 , to align the mapping grid to the axis of the outflow .",
    "the observed molecular lines are summarized in table 1 .",
    "we used two sis receivers with 500 mhz bandwidth by dividing the beam into two linear polarized waves through a wire grid , each of which covered the frequency range of the molecular lines listed in table 1 , and co - added the data to improve the signal to noise ratio .",
    "the beam squint between the two receivers was confirmed to be less than 1@xmath13 . typical single sideband ( ssb ) system noise temperature was @xmath7 300 k for both receivers . the beam size and",
    "the main beam efficiency of the telescope was 17@xmath13 and 0.5 , respectively , at 96 ghz .",
    "the telescope pointing was checked every 60 - 90 minutes by observing sio maser emission from nml - tau at 43 ghz , and was confirmed to be better than 5@xmath13 .",
    "the observational mode was position - switching .",
    "we used a bank of eight high - resolution acousto - optical spectrometers ( aos ) with a bandwidth of 40 mhz and a frequency resolution of 37 khz .",
    "the frequency resolution corresponds to @xmath7 0.11 km s@xmath8 for the observed lines .",
    "typical rms noise per channel was @xmath7 0.06 k in units of t@xmath15@xmath16 ( hereafter we present line intensities in units of t@xmath15@xmath16 ) .    in order to calibrate the intensity variation caused by different receiver gains and/or sky conditions",

    "figure 1 shows profiles of the ch@xmath0oh and c@xmath3s lines toward the central position of iram 04191 . since the integration time toward the central position was much longer ( 37 min ) than that in other mapping positions , signal - to - noise ratios of these spectra ( rms @xmath7 0.025 k ) are better than those at other points .",

    "both the ch@xmath0oh and c@xmath3s lines at the position of iram 04191 show single - peaked , gaussian - like profiles with possible redshifted wings .",
    "gaussian fittings to these profiles show that peak velocities and line widths of the spectra are @xmath7 6.6 - 6.7 km s@xmath8 and @xmath7 0.4 - 0.5 km s@xmath8 , respectively ( see table 2 ) .",
    "the c@xmath3s profile is essentially same as in belloche et al .",
    "andr et al .",
    "( 1999a ) have shown that cs ( @xmath4=21 ) and h@xmath30co ( 2@xmath31 1@xmath32 ) lines from iram 04191 exhibit the double - peaked , asymmetric spectral signature of protostellar collapse @xcite .",
    "the peak velocity of the ch@xmath0oh and c@xmath3s lines corresponds to the velocity of the absorption `` dip '' of the cs ( @xmath4=21 ) and h@xmath30co ( 2@xmath331@xmath32 ) profiles , suggesting that the ch@xmath0oh and c@xmath3s lines are optically thin .",
    "hereafter , we refer to 6.7 km s@xmath8 as a systemic velocity of iram 04191 , which is shown in a vertical dotted line in figure 1 .      in this subsection , spatial and velocity distribution of the ch@xmath0oh emission is discussed .",
    "we only adopt the ch@xmath0oh ( 2@xmath241@xmath24 a@xmath25 ) line here because the 2@xmath261@xmath34 e transition shows essentially the same distribution as that the 2@xmath241@xmath24 a@xmath25 transition shows in our mapping observations , and because the 2@xmath241@xmath24 e transition , which has a higher energy level than the other two detected lines ( see table 1 ) , is detected only at several positions in the mapping observations .",

    ", another ch@xmath0oh emission feature was detected in the vicinity of iram 04191 .",
    "the peak position of this emission feature shifts from the northwest ( at 6.3 , 6.5 and 6.7 km s@xmath8 ) to the southeast ( at 6.9 and 7.1 km s@xmath8 ) , and then to the northeast of the central star ( at 7.3 km s@xmath8 ) . at redshifted velocities ( 6.9 - 7.3 km s@xmath8 )",
    ", there is an additional ch@xmath0oh emission feature detected at @xmath7 60@xmath13 west to the central star .",
    "this feature is likely to be independent of the 6.3 - 6.7 km s@xmath8 component seen at the northwest , since the line profile toward this feature shows a double peak , one from the 6.3 - 6.7 km s@xmath8 component and the other from this new feature ( see figure 3 ) . at the northeastern edge of the mapping region",
    ", there appears strong ch@xmath0oh emission but the limited observing time prevented us from extending our mapping region to cover this component .",
    "hence , this emission will not be discussed in this paper .",
    "we note that toward iras 04191 + 1523 ( filled squares in figure 2 ) the ch@xmath0oh emission distribution seems to be local minimum and there is no clear ch@xmath0oh condensation associated with iras 04191 + 1523 .",
    "the above examination of the ch@xmath0oh channel maps shows that four ch@xmath0oh emission features at different velocities are present in iram 04191 . in order to investigate the nature of these different emission features in more detail ,",
    "the channel maps are integrated over three different velocity ranges , i.e. , 5.0 - 6.5 km s@xmath35 , 6.5 - 6.9 km s@xmath8 , and 6.9 - 7.4 km s@xmath8 , which roughly distinguish the different ch@xmath0oh emission components from each other .",
    "figure 3 shows three maps integrated over the above velocity ranges , superposed on the co ( @xmath4=21 ) outflow map obtained by andr et al .",
    "( 1999a ) .",
    "the map of the systemic velocity ( figure 3 ; 6.5 - 6.9 km s@xmath8 ) shows a ch@xmath0oh condensation elongated in the east - west direction ( p.a . @xmath7 110@xmath14 ) , which is almost perpendicular to the outflow axis .",
    "the southern side of the condensation shows a concavity , through which the blueshifted outflow extends to south .",
    "this condensation is most likely a molecular envelope associated with iram  04191 , although the position of iram  04191 is slightly ( @xmath7 20@xmath13 east ) offset from the center of the condensation .",
    "this kind of the elongated envelope is often associated with protostars @xcite .",
    "hence , hereafter we call this condensation `` env '' . the deconvolved size and the deconvolved line width of env",
    "were measured to be @xmath7 0.07 pc @xmath5 0.04 pc and @xmath7 0.5 km s@xmath8 , respectively .",
    "these values are comparable to the typical size and line width of envelopes associated with low - mass protostellar sources @xcite .    as has been suggested by the channel maps in figure 2 ,",
    "there is a velocity gradient along the major axis of env .",
    "figure 4 , the position - velocity ( p - v ) diagram cutting along the major axis , demonstrates the velocity gradient clearly , as indicated by the thick dashed line .",
    "this velocity gradient is most probably attributed to rotation of env because it is obviously seen along the major axis of env .",
    "this velocity gradient was also seen in the n@xmath30h@xmath36 ( @xmath4=10 ) line ( belloche et al .",
    "it should be noted that , the velocity gradient can be seen only in the vicinity of the central star ( within @xmath7 0.01  pc from the central star ) , while the outer part of env , particularly the western side , does not show a clear velocity shift from the systemic velocity .",
    "this might be because the rotation of env is differential , so that the rotation velocity becomes larger in the inner part of env .",
    "the velocity gradient was measured to be @xmath7 40  km  s@xmath8  pc@xmath8 , which is 10 - 100 times larger than that in other molecular cores measured by goodman et al .",
    "this difference may result from the difference in the radius where velocity gradients are measured , i.e. , in our case the gradient was measured at @xmath7 0.01  pc in radius , while goodman et al .",
    "( 1993 ) measured those gradients typically at @xmath7 0.1  pc in radius .",
    "the map integrated over 5.0 - 6.5 km s@xmath8 ( the middle panel in figure  3 ) shows two compact ( @xmath7 0.03 pc ) condensations , connected by extended emission at lower levels .",
    "these condensations correspond to the two emission features seen at blueshifted velocities in the channel maps .",
    "hereafter , we will call these compact ch@xmath0oh condensations `` blue1 '' ( the western , stronger one ) and `` blue2 '' , respectively .",
    "these two blueshifted gas components were also detected in the cs(21 ) line ( belloche et al .",
    "2002 ; see their fig .",
    "as described below , physical properties of blue1 and blue2 are significantly different from those of env :    * blue1 and blue2 are not located in the vicinity of the central star , but located at the southern edge of env .",
    "comparison with the co outflow map shows that blue1 and blue2 locate on the the western and eastern sides of the blueshifted outflow lobe , respectively .",
    "specifically , the peak of blue1 locates just beside the strongest peak in the blueshifted co outflow .",
    "* line profiles toward blue1 and blue2 show non - gaussian shapes , with much wider line widths ( up to 2.0 km s@xmath8 ) than that of env and centroid velocities blueshifted by @xmath7 0.8 km s@xmath8 from the systemic velocity ( table 2 , 3 ) .",
    "the p - v diagram ( figure 5 ) of the ch@xmath0oh emission along the blueshifted outflow ( solid line in figure 3 ) shows abrupt increase of the line width from @xmath7 0.5 km s@xmath8 to @xmath7 2.0 km s@xmath8 at the position of blue 1 .",
    "these results suggest that blue1 and blue2 are physically different from env .",
    "the origin of blue1 and blue2 will be discussed in @xmath374 in detail .    in the map integrated over 6.9 - 7.4 km s@xmath8 ( the lower panel in figure  3 ) ,",
    "there is a ch@xmath0oh condensation detected to the west of the protostar , as well as a condensation appearing to the east of the protostar .",
    "as seen in figure 2 , the eastern condensation seems to be a part of env , while it delineates the southeast side of the redshifted outflow and could represent the interaction region between env and the redshifted outflow @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the western condensation is not a part of env , but the one corresponding to the emission feature detected at redshifted velocities in the channel maps .",
    "hereafter , we will call the redshifted western condensation `` red '' .",
    "the line profile toward red shows a double - peaked feature , i.e. , one peaked at 6.7 km s@xmath8 arising from env , and the other peaked at 7.1 km s@xmath8 arising from red .",
    "it is found that , while the size of red is as compact as that of blue1 or blue2 ( @xmath7 0.03 pc ) , the line width is narrow ( @xmath7 0.3 km s@xmath8 ) .",
    "figure 6 shows velocity channel maps of the c@xmath3s ( @xmath4=21 ) emission",
    ". the velocity range and interval of figure 6 are same as those of the ch@xmath0oh ( 2@xmath241@xmath24 a@xmath36 ) channel maps shown in figure 2 .",
    "the typical intensity of the c@xmath3s emission is a factor of 2 lower than the intensity of the ch@xmath0oh emission in the mapped area .",
    "the c@xmath3s emission was not detected at every velocity channel where the ch@xmath0oh emission was detected , but only in the velocity range from 6.3 to 7.1 km s@xmath8 where env and a part of red were detected in the ch@xmath0oh map . in that velocity range ,",
    "the spatial distribution of the c@xmath3s emission is similar to that of the ch@xmath0oh emission .",
    "since the c@xmath3s emission is weaker than the ch@xmath0oh emission , we will concentrate on the ch@xmath0oh data in the following discussions .",
    "the molecular abundance is one of the most important parameters to describe chemical properties of the four condensations , that is , env , blue1 , blue2 , and red .",
    "we have estimated the molecular abundance of ch@xmath0oh for each condensation by dividing the ch@xmath0oh column density ( @xmath38 ) by the molecular hydrogen column density ( @xmath39 ) , both of which are measured at the central position of each condensation . in order to estimate @xmath40 , we assume that the emission lines are optically thin , which is valid for the emission lines we observed ( see table 3 ) .",
    "in addition we assume local thermal equilibrium ( lte ) condition of the ch@xmath0oh transitions and the equal partition function for both a - state and e - state ch@xmath0oh @xcite . under these conditions ,",
    "the column density is given by the following formula ; @xmath41 where @xmath42 in the above expressions , @xmath43 is the planck constant , @xmath44 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath45 is the speed of light , @xmath46 is the line frequency , t@xmath47 is the excitation temperature of the ch@xmath48oh transitions , @xmath49 is the background radiation temperature , @xmath50 is the einstein a coefficient of the transition , @xmath51 is the partition function , @xmath52 is the rotational energy level of the lower energy state , @xmath53 is the rotational quantum number of the lower energy state , and @xmath54v is the integrated line intensity .",
    "we adopted t@xmath47 of 10 k for all the condensations , according to our estimation of t@xmath47 from excitation analyses using the data of the ( @xmath1=5@xmath24@xmath2 ) band obtained with the jcmt and the data of the ( @xmath1=2@xmath21@xmath2 ) band presented here on the assumption of the large velocity gradient ( lvg ) condition @xcite .",
    "details of the lvg analyses with the multi - transitional ch@xmath0oh lines will be presented in a subsequent paper .",
    "the column densities of molecular hydrogen , on the other hand , were estimated using the 1.3 mm dust continuum data of iram  04191 taken with the iram 30  m telescope @xcite .",
    "we read out intensity values of the dust continuum emission at each central position , and calculated @xmath55 by using the formula and the dust temperature used in andr et al .",
    "( 1999a ) and motte & andr ( 2001 ) .",
    "ch@xmath0oh abundances were estimated from these @xmath40 and @xmath39 . here , we did not take into account the difference of the beam size between our observations ( 17@xmath13 ) and the 1.3 mm continuum observations with the iram 30 m telescope ( 13@xmath13 ) .",
    "all the derived values are listed in table  3 .",
    "the ch@xmath0oh abundance toward the protostar was estimated to be @xmath7 2.1 @xmath5 10@xmath56 , which is indistinguishable from the ch@xmath0oh abundance toward the cyanopolyyne peak in tmc-1 ( @xmath7 2.0 @xmath5 10@xmath56 ; pratap et al .",
    "1997 , takakuwa et al .",
    "on the other hand , the ch@xmath0oh abundances toward blue1 , blue2 , and red are 5 - 10 times larger than that toward the protostar .",
    "we will discuss this abundance enhancement later in more detail .",
    "in addition to the chemical properties of the ch@xmath0oh condensations discussed above , we examined the physical properties of the condensations .",
    "the lte mass of each condensation , m@xmath57 , was calculated using the column density and size listed in table  3 .",
    "the fractional abundance of ch@xmath0oh for each condensation we estimated in the previous section ( also listed in table  3 ) was used to estimate the total h@xmath58 gas mass .",
    "the lte mass obtained in this way is 2.3 m@xmath6 for env , while less than 0.1 m@xmath6 for the other three condensations . in order to examine whether or not the ch@xmath0oh condensations are gravitationally bound , we compared m@xmath57 with the virial mass ( m@xmath59 ) calculated from the size ( d ) and the fwhm line width ( @xmath60v ) using the following formula , @xmath61 where @xmath62 in the above expressions @xmath63 is the effective sound speed of gas and @xmath64 is the gravitational constant .",
    "note that the above expressions assume a condensation with a uniform density distribution .",
    "the masses of each ch@xmath0oh condensation derived from these two different ways are listed in table 3 .",
    "the virial mass of env is similar to its lte mass , suggesting that env is probably virialized .",
    "in addition , the derived mass is comparable to the typical mass of the low - mass star - forming envelopes @xcite .",
    "these results suggest that env is an envelope being in the course of star - formation , and env is indeed associated with the protostar of iram  04191 .",
    "in contrast to env , the virial masses of blue1 and blue2 are @xmath7 30 - 100 times larger than their lte masses , suggesting that the blueshifted components are most likely gravitationally unbound . similarly to the blueshifted components , the virial mass of red is @xmath710 times larger than its lte mass , which suggests that red is also likely gravitationally unbound .",
    "our ch@xmath0oh observations of iram 04191 have revealed that , in addition to the envelope ( env ) associated with star formation activity , there are two blueshifted gas condensations ( blue1 , blue2 ) and one redshifted gas condensation ( red ) .",
    "the observed properties of the blueshifted components , i.e. , located at the periphery of the blueshifted co outflow , the wider line width , and the centroid velocity blueshifted from the systemic velocity , suggest that the blueshifted components are likely to be related to the blue lobe of the co outflow .",
    "the total momentum of the blueshifted components is comparable to the co outflow momentum ( @xmath7 0.12  m@xmath6 km s@xmath65 ; andr et al .",
    "1999a ) , suggesting that the blueshifted components can be pushed by the outflow .",
    "in addition , offset velocities ( v@xmath66 @xmath67 ( v@xmath68  v@xmath69 ) / cos @xmath70 ; where @xmath70 is the inclination angle of the outflow from the line of sight ) of the blueshifted ch@xmath0oh condensations are comparable to velocities necessary for the blueshifted condensations to escape from the gravitational potential of the central star - forming system , that is , v@xmath71",
    "@xmath67 @xmath72 , where m is the mass of the envelope ( @xmath73 = 2.3 m@xmath6 ) + star ( 0.05 m@xmath6 ) and r is the projected distance from the protostar ( table 4 ) .",
    "these results suggest that both blue1 and blue2 are most likely to be formed in consequence of interaction between the outflow and the ambient dense gas surrounding the protostar , and that the blueshifted components are pushed away from the ambient cloud core .",
    "the eastern condensation , which seems to be a part of env and delineates the southeast side of the redshifted outflow ( figure 3 lower panel ) , might also represent a core interacting with the redshifted outflow @xcite .",
    "nakano , hasegawa , & norman ( 1995 ) theoretically investigated mechanisms of setting the final stellar mass in the process of star formation , and proposed that the dispersal of the parent cloud core as a result of the interaction with the mass outflow ( e.g. momose et al .",
    "1996 ; velusamy & langer 1998 ) is crucial for fixing the final stellar mass .",
    "hence , it is interesting to discuss whether the interaction with the iram  04191 molecular outflow plays an important role in the dissipation of the surrounding molecular cloud core and the process of the stellar mass determination . as discussed in @xmath373.5 , the blueshifted components are gravitationally unbound , suggesting that they will most likely dissipate eventually .",
    "the time scale of the dissipation , roughly estimated as @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the size of the condensation and @xmath63 is the effective sound speed derived from the line width , is @xmath7 5 @xmath5 10@xmath76 yr .",
    "this time scale is comparable to the typical life time of the accreting protostar , @xmath77  yr @xcite .",
    "hence , the dissipation of the surrounding cloud core may sufficiently proceed around iram  04191 during the main accretion phase , resulting in setting the stellar mass .",
    "we note , however , that the total mass of the blueshifted components ( @xmath7 0.15 m@xmath6 ) , which will most likely dissipate , is at most 7@xmath23 of the total mass of the envelope , suggesting that the total amount of the dissipating gas may not be high enough to have a significant impact onto the supply of matter for the mass accretion .",
    "since iram  04191 is considered to be a very young class 0 protostar @xcite , the outflow may just have started interacting with the surrounding cloud core so that the core dissipation may not proceed enough yet .",
    "we speculate that the outflow will keep interacting with the surrounding cloud core , resulting in dissipation of significant fraction of the surrounding cloud core .",
    "the origin of the redshifted component , on the other hand , is less clear .",
    "its narrow line width ( @xmath7 0.3  km s@xmath8 ) suggests that the redshifted component is not related to the outflow .",
    "there is no clear star formation activity found in the redshifted condensation .",
    "the physical properties of the redshifted condensation , i.e. , the narrow line width , the small mass ( @xmath7 0.07 m@xmath6 ) and size ( @xmath7 0.02 pc ) , and non - virialization , are rather similar to those of small - scale clumps found in starless cores @xcite .",
    "previous observations of molecular outflows associated with l1157 @xcite , ngc1333 iras 2 @xcite , and bhr 71 @xcite have also showed ch@xmath0oh emission arising from regions where the outflows interact with the surrounding dense gas .",
    "an important , common result obtained from these previous observations is that the ch@xmath0oh emission arising from the interaction regions is much more intense and broader than that from the positions of the driving sources .",
    "the more intense emission has been attributed to bowshock heating , caused by the interaction between the outflows and the dense gas , leading to the enhancement of the ch@xmath0oh abundance ( see table 5 ) .",
    "is the blueshifted ch@xmath0oh emission in iram  04191 under influence of such bowshock heating ?    as discussed in @xmath373.4 .",
    ", the ch@xmath0oh abundance in the blueshifted condensations is enhanced by a factor of @xmath7 10 with respect to that at the position of the protostar .",
    "this abundance enhancement might be due to shocks associated with the interaction between the blueshifted outflow and the surrounding dense gas .",
    "however , the enhancement seen in the blueshifted condensations is not as dramatic as that seen in the above - mentioned three outflows associated with shocks : the ch@xmath48oh abundances in these outflows with shocks were estimated to be enhanced by more than 2 orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "we also note that the c@xmath3s emission , which is also enhanced in the shocked regions @xcite was barely detected at the positions of the blueshifted components in iram 04191 .",
    "if ch@xmath0oh is enhanced due to shocks caused by the outflow , then the ch@xmath0oh enhancement should be localized on the shocked regions . in order to see if there is such localization of the ch@xmath0oh enhancement , the ch@xmath0oh abundance map in the iram  04191 region , shown in figure 7 ,",
    "was made from the ratio of the total integrated intensity map of the ch@xmath0oh emission to the 1.3 mm dust continuum map @xcite .",
    "we adopted the same assumptions as those in @xmath373.4 to create this abundance map .",
    "we can clearly see that the ch@xmath0oh abundance is extensively enhanced in the periphery of the entire region , including the position of red , which shows no sign of interaction .",
    "there is no local enhancement of the ch@xmath0oh abundance toward blue2 and probably blue1 , for which the fractional abundance was not determined because of less signal - to - noise ratio of the 1.3 mm dust continuum map @xcite .",
    "we have also conducted sub - millimeter ch@xmath0oh ( @xmath1=5@xmath784@xmath2 , 7@xmath26@xmath2 ) observations with the jcmt toward blue1 , and have found the temperature of the blueshifted component is cold ( @xmath7 10 k ) , suggesting that there is no local shock heating toward the blueshifted component ( our forthcoming paper ) .",
    "these results suggest that the ch@xmath0oh abundance enhancement seen in the blueshifted components is not due to shocks associated with the interaction between the blueshifted outflow and the dense core .",
    "we consider that the observed abundance gradient is likely to reflect the chemistry in the protostellar core rather than the effect of shocks due to the outflow .",
    "recently , aikawa et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have constructed chemical evolutionary models of a collapsing dense core .",
    "they found that chemical abundances of molecules are functions of both the evolutionary time - scale and the distance from the core center .",
    "they showed that , the abundances of `` early - type '' molecules , which are considered to be more abundant in the early stage of chemical evolution of dense cores , significantly decrease in the central regions of the dense core as the evolutionary time goes on , resulting in abundances of early - type molecules appearing `` enhanced '' in the periphery of the dense core .",
    "since ch@xmath0oh is considered to be one of the early - type molecules @xcite , the observed ch@xmath0oh abundance variation in iram 04191 is consistent with their model .",
    "such abundance gradients of early - type molecules such as ccs were also shown in other observations @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to discuss why the blueshifted ch@xmath79oh emission in iram  04191 is not due to shock heating by the blueshifted outflow , which most probably interacts with the ambient cloud . in table 5 ,",
    "dynamical properties of the co outflow from iram  04191 are compared with those of the three outflows with shock - enhanced ch@xmath0oh emission .",
    "the table shows that the flow velocities ( v@xmath80 ) of the co outflows are very different between the three co outflow and iram  04191 outflow .",
    "the flow velocities of the three co outflows in the shocked regions are all above 20 km s@xmath8 , whereas the flow velocity of iram  04191 outflow is below 10 km s@xmath8 .",
    "we also note that the line widths and the offset velocity ( v@xmath66 ) of the ch@xmath0oh components in iram 04191 are also small as compared to those in the other shocked outflows ( table 5 ) .",
    "shocks associated with molecular outflows from protostars are generally considered to be c - type shocks @xcite . according to detailed models of c - type shocks including the calculation of the chemical composition ( i.e. , coolants ) and the grain size distribution ,",
    "heating caused by c - type shocks is a strong function of the flow velocity , or the shock velocity @xcite .",
    "these models show that shock velocity higher than @xmath7 10 km s@xmath8 is necessary to yield temperature enhancement higher than 120 k , which is considered to be the minimum required temperature to release ch@xmath0oh on dust grains into gas phase @xcite .",
    "thus , the difference in v@xmath80 may explain why iram  04191 is not associated with ch@xmath0oh emission enhanced due to shocks .",
    "we have carried out mapping observations around the young class 0 protostar , iram 04191 + 1522 , in the ch@xmath0oh ( @xmath12=2@xmath21@xmath2 ) and c@xmath3s ( @xmath4=21 ) lines with the nro 45 m telescope .",
    "the main results are as follows .",
    "a dense gas envelope surrounding the protostar was traced both in the ch@xmath0oh and c@xmath3s lines .",
    "the envelope has a size of @xmath7 0.07 pc @xmath5 0.04 pc , line width of @xmath7 0.5 km s@xmath8 , and lte mass of @xmath7 2.3 m@xmath6 .",
    "there is a steep velocity gradient of @xmath7 40 km s@xmath8 pc@xmath8 along the nw - se direction , i.e. , perpendicular to the axis of the outflow , in the envelope .",
    "this velocity gradient is interpreted as the rotation of the envelope .",
    "the ch@xmath0oh map shows two compact ( @xmath7 0.03 pc in size ) , blueshifted ( @xmath7 0.8 km s@xmath8 from the systemic velocity ) condensations with wide line widths ( up to 2.0 km s@xmath8 ) at the periphery of the blueshifted lobe of the co outflow .",
    "the compact condensations have momenta ( @xmath7 0.06 m@xmath6 km s@xmath8 ) comparable to that of the blueshifted molecular outflow .",
    "these results suggest that the two blueshifted components are likely to be formed by means of interaction between the outflow and its surrounding dense gas .",
    "the lte masses of these blueshifted components ( @xmath7 0.07 m@xmath6 ) are two orders of magnitude lower than their virial masses , suggesting that these condensations are not bound by their self - gravity , and most likely will dissipate eventually .",
    "\\3 . the ch@xmath0oh abundance in the two blueshifted condensations",
    "is enhanced by a factor of @xmath7 10 with respect to that toward the position of the protostar ( @xmath7 2.1 @xmath5 10@xmath56 ) . however , this abundance enhancement is less significant as compared to that seen in the outflows with shock heating .",
    "in addition , the spatial variation of the ch@xmath0oh abundance does not show the local enhancement at the positions of the blueshifted condensations , but shows the trend of decrease toward the center and increase toward the periphery .",
    "such an abundance variation is explained by the effect of chemical evolution of the collapsing dense core rather than by the shock chemistry .",
    "a comparison of the properties of the co outflow in iram 04191 with those with shock heating suggests that the velocity of the outflow in iram 04191 ( less than 10 km s@xmath8 ) is not high enough to produce shocks that can release the ch@xmath0oh molecules from dust mantles .",
