    ", we can modify @xmath17 to a minimal filling @xmath90 that admits an allowable symplectic lefschetz fibration due to theorem  [ thm : lefschetz ] .",
    "it then follows from eliashberg s topological characterization of stein manifolds @xcite ( see also @xcite ) that @xmath90 is symplectically deformation equivalent to a stein domain .",
    "recall that by a result of giroux @xcite , a contact @xmath4manifold is stein fillable if and only if it admits a supporting open book whose monodromy is a product of positive dehn twists .",
    "one can understand this in the context of lefschetz fibrations as follows : if @xmath10 is a stein filling of @xmath9 , then it admits a lefschetz fibration over the disk by a result of loi - piergallini @xcite or akbulut - ozbagci @xcite .",
    "the monodromy of the resulting open book decomposition of @xmath3 can then be obtained by composing positive dehn twists along the vanishing cycles of each singular fiber ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "conversely , any open book with this property can be realized as the boundary of some lefschetz fibration , which admits a stein structure due to eliashberg @xcite .",
    "giroux asked whether it might in fact be true that _ every _ open book of @xmath9 must have this property when @xmath9 is stein fillable .",
    "theorem  [ thm : lefschetz ] implies an affirmative answer at least for the planar open books :    [ cor : monodromy ] if @xmath9 is a planar contact manifold , then it is strongly ( and thus stein ) fillable if and only if every supporting planar open book has monodromy isotopic to a product of positive dehn twists .    as an immediate consequence of corollary  [ cor : stein ] ,",
    "we also obtain a new obstruction to the existence of planar open books :    [ cor : planar ] if @xmath9 is a contact manifold which is strongly fillable but not stein fillable , then it is not planar .",
    "[ remark : paolo ] it was not known until recently whether strong and stein fillability are equivalent notions : a negative answer was provided by a construction due to p.  ghiggini @xcite of strongly fillable contact manifolds that are not stein fillable .",
    "it follows then from the above results that ghiggini s contact structures are not planar .",
    "the reason here for the restriction to planar contact structures is that a planar open book can always be presented as the projection of a @xmath5dimensional @xmath91invariant family of @xmath1holomorphic curves in the symplectization @xmath92 .",
    "this is a special case of a construction due to c.  abbas @xcite that relates open book decompositions on general contact manifolds to solutions of a nonlinear elliptic problem , which specifically in the planar case gives @xmath1holomorphic curves .",
    "( an existence proof for the planar case is also given in @xcite . ) for analytical reasons , @xmath1holomorphic curves with the desired properties and higher genus generically can not exist .",
    "nonetheless , one can sometimes derive interesting results for non - planar contact manifolds using other kinds of decompositions with genus zero fibers , of which the following is an example .",
    "let @xmath93 with coordinates @xmath94 , and write the standard contact structure on @xmath0 as @xmath95 where @xmath96 this can be identified with the canonical contact form on the unit cotangent bundle @xmath97 as follows : writing points in @xmath98 as @xmath99 , we use the natural identification of @xmath2 with @xmath100 and write the canonical @xmath101form as @xmath102 .",
    "the @xmath4torus is then @xmath103 , with the @xmath104coordinate corresponding to the point @xmath105 , and @xmath106 is the restriction of @xmath102 to this submanifold .",
    "the canonical symplectic form @xmath107 on @xmath108 can then be written as @xmath109 for the proper plurisubharmonic function @xmath110 , thus @xmath111 is a stein domain ; we shall refer to it as the _ standard _ stein filling of @xmath112 .",
    "more generally , one has the following construction :    a _ star shaped domain _",
    "@xmath113 is a subset of the form @xmath114 $ ,   $ ( q , p ) \\in s^*t^2 $ } \\}$ ] for some smooth function @xmath115 .",
    "observe that the boundary @xmath116 of a star shaped domain is always transverse to the radial liouville vector field @xmath117 , thus @xmath118 is clearly an exact filling of  @xmath0 .",
    "eliashberg showed in @xcite that @xmath119 is the _ only _ strongly fillable contact structure on  @xmath0 .",
    "it is not planar due to @xcite*theorem  4.1 , as the standard filling has @xmath120 , though van horn - morris @xcite has shown that it does admit a genus  @xmath101 open book .",
    "it also admits the following decomposition , which one might think of as a generalization of an open book with planar pages .",
    "let @xmath121 , a union of two disjoint pre - lagrangian @xmath5tori , and define @xmath122 this is a smooth fibration , and we can think of it intuitively as a union of two open book decompositions with cylindrical pages , and the subset @xmath123 playing the role of the binding . it supports the contact structure in the sense that @xmath124 is positive on each fiber , and the fibers have natural compactifications with boundary in @xmath123 such that @xmath106 is positive on these boundaries . as with an open book , one can `` fatten '' @xmath123 to a neighborhood @xmath125 and deform @xmath33 to a nearby fibration @xmath126 whose fibers are compact annuli .    [ thm : t3 ] suppose @xmath10 is any strong symplectic filling of @xmath112 .",
    "then one can attach to @xmath17 a trivial symplectic cobordism , producing an enlarged filling @xmath87 that admits a symplectic lefschetz fibration @xmath127 \\times s^1 $ ] for which @xmath128 .",
    "moreover , every singular fiber is the union of an annulus with an exceptional sphere ; in particular , there are no singular fibers if @xmath10 is minimal .",
    "there is also a stability result for the lefschetz fibrations considered thus far .",
    "note that in the following , we do nt assume the symplectic forms @xmath129 are cohomologous .",
    "this result is applied in @xcite to classify strong fillings of various contact manifolds up to symplectic deformation equivalence .",
    "[ thm : stability ] if @xmath130 for @xmath131 $ ] is a smooth @xmath101parameter family of strong fillings of either a planar contact manifold @xmath9 or @xmath112 , then by attaching a smooth family of trivial symplectic cobordisms , one can construct a smooth family of strong fillings @xmath132 for which @xmath133 is independent of @xmath72 near @xmath134 , and there exists a smooth family of @xmath133symplectic lefschetz fibrations @xmath135 as in theorems  [ thm : lefschetz ] and  [ thm : t3 ] , such that the critical points vary smoothly with  @xmath72 .",
    "stipsicz showed using a gauge theory argument @xcite that all stein fillings of  @xmath0 are homeomorphic to @xmath111 , and conjectured that this result can be strengthened to a diffeomorphism .",
    "in fact , more turns out to be true : by theorem  [ thm : t3 ] , every minimal strong filling @xmath17 of @xmath0 admits a symplectic fibration over the annulus with cylindrical fibers .",
    "one can now repeat this construction starting from a different decomposition of @xmath0 ( corresponding to a change in the @xmath99coordinates ) , and thus show that @xmath17 admits two symplectic fibrations over the annulus , with cylindrical fibers such that any two fibers from each fibration intersect each other once transversely .",
    "this provides a diffeomorphism from @xmath17 with an attached cylindrical end to @xmath2 , and in  [ sec : t3 ] we will use moser isotopy arguments to show :    [ thm : steint3 ] all minimal strong fillings of @xmath0 are symplectically deformation equivalent , and every exact filling of @xmath0 is symplectomorphic to a star shaped domain in @xmath136 .",
    "every minimal strong filling of @xmath0 , and in particular every stein filling , is diffeomorphic to @xmath111 .",
    "the first uniqueness result of this type was obtained by eliashberg @xcite , who showed that all stein fillings of @xmath137 are diffeomorphic to the @xmath36ball . shortly afterwards ,",
    "mcduff @xcite classified stein fillings of the lens spaces @xmath138 with their standard contact structures up to diffeomorphism , showing in particular that they are unique for all @xmath139 .",
    "mcduff argued by compactification in order to apply her classification results for rational and ruled symplectic @xmath36manifolds , and several other uniqueness and finiteness results have since been obtained using similar ideas , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "many of these uniqueness results can be recovered , and some of them strengthened or generalized , using the punctured holomorphic curve techniques introduced here ( cf .",
    "by contrast , there are also contact manifolds that admit infinitely many non - diffeomorphic or non - homeomorphic stein fillings : see @xcite and the references mentioned therein .",
    "the aforementioned result of mcduff for @xmath138 was strengthened to uniqueness up to stein deformation equivalence by r.  hind @xcite , using a construction similar to ours , though the technical arguments are somewhat different .",
    "hind uses a foliation by @xmath1holomorphic planes asymptotic to a multiply covered orbit ; since planes can not undergo nodal degenerations unless there are closed curves involved , singular fibers are ruled out and the result is a smooth symplectic fibration outside of the asymptotic orbit .",
    "this fibration can then be used to construct a plurisubharmonic function with control over the critical points , thus leading to a uniqueness result up to stein homotopy .",
    "it is plausible that one could apply hind s idea to our construction and further sharpen our classification of stein fillings for @xmath0 , though we will not pursue this here .",
    "another consequence of theorem  [ thm : steint3 ] ( and also a step in its proof ) is that every exact filling of @xmath0 becomes symplectomorphic to @xmath136 after attaching a positive cylindrical end .",
    "it is then natural to ask about the topology of the compactly supported symplectomorphism group . in ",
    "[ sec : t3 ] we will prove :    [ thm : sympt3 ] the group @xmath140 of symplectomorphisms with compact support is contractible .",
    "the results stated so far all start with the assumption that a filling exists , and then use the existence of some @xmath1holomorphic curves to deduce properties of the filling . in other situations , the same argument can sometimes lead to a contradiction , thus defining an obstruction to filling  to understand this , we must first recall some general notions about holomorphic curves in symplectizations and finite energy foliations .    if @xmath25 is a contact form on @xmath3 , then the _ reeb vector field _",
    "@xmath141 is defined by the conditions @xmath142 the _ symplectization _",
    "@xmath92 then admits a natural splitting of its tangent bundle @xmath143 ; let us denote the @xmath91coordinate on @xmath92 by @xmath144 and let @xmath64 denote the corresponding unit vector field .",
    "there is now a nonempty and contractible space @xmath145 of almost complex structures @xmath1 on @xmath92 having the following properties :    * @xmath1 is invariant under the @xmath91action by translation on @xmath92 * @xmath146 * @xmath147 and @xmath148 is compatible with the symplectic structure @xmath149    given @xmath150 , we will consider @xmath1holomorphic curves @xmath151 where @xmath152 is a closed riemann surface , @xmath153 is the punctured surface determined by some finite subset @xmath154 , and @xmath155 has _",

    "@xmath156 for any @xmath157periodic orbit @xmath158 of @xmath159 .",
    "we will not need to recall the precise definition of the energy here , only that its finiteness constrains the behavior of @xmath155 at the punctures : each puncture is either removable or represents a positive / negative _ cylindrical end _ , at which @xmath155 approximates an orbit cylinder , asymptotically approaching a ( perhaps multiply covered ) periodic orbit in @xmath160 .",
    "recall that a @xmath157periodic orbit is called _ nondegenerate _ if the transversal restriction of the linearized time  @xmath157 flow along the orbit does not have @xmath101 as an eigenvalue .",

    "we say that @xmath25 is _ morse - bott _ if every periodic orbit belongs to a morse - bott submanifold ; this will be a standing assumption throughout .",

    "now consider a compact @xmath4dimensional submanifold @xmath163 , possibly with boundary , such that @xmath164 is a morse - bott submanifold .",

    "* every @xmath168 is the image of an embedded finite energy @xmath1holomorphic curve satisfying a uniform energy bound .    in light of the second requirement",
    ", we shall often blur the distinction between leaves and the @xmath1holomorphic curves that parametrize them .",
    "the definition has several immediate consequences : most notably , let @xmath169 denote the set of all simple periodic orbits that have covers occurring as asymptotic orbits for leaves of @xmath165 .",
    "then an easy positivity of intersections argument ( see e.g.  @xcite ) implies that for each @xmath170 , the orbit cylinder @xmath171 is a leaf in @xmath165 , and every leaf that is nt one of these remains embedded under the natural projection @xmath172 in fact , abusing notation to regard @xmath169 as a subset of @xmath3 , the quotient @xmath173 defines a smooth foliation of @xmath174 by embedded surfaces transverse to @xmath159 .",

    "global constructions are harder but do exist , for instance on the tight @xmath4sphere @xcite , on overtwisted contact manifolds @xcite and more generally on planar contact manifolds @xcite .",
