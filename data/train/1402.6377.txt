    "fibonacci cubes were introduced by hsu  @xcite as a model for interconnection networks . like the hypercube graphs ,",
    "fibonacci cubes have several properties which make them ideal as a network topology , yet their size grows significantly slower than that of the hypercubes .",
    "fibonacci cubes have been extensively investigated ; see , for example , the recent survey by klavar  @xcite and even more recent papers of klavar and mollard  @xcite and vesel  @xcite . in the first of these papers , different asymptotic properties of fibonacci cubes are established , while in the latter a linear recognition algorithm is designed for recognizing fibonacci cubes , improving the previous best recognition algorithm of taranenko and vesel  @xcite .",
    "later , ili , klavar , and rho  @xcite introduced the idea of generalized fibonacci cubes ( as defined above ) . under the same name ,",
    "the graphs @xmath27 were studied by liu , hsu , and chung  @xcite and zagaglia salvi  @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the properties of generalized fibonacci cubes led to the study of several problems related to the combinatorics of words .",
    "to study their isometric embeddability into hypercubes , good and bad words were introduced by klavar and shpectorov  @xcite , where it was proved that about eight percent of all words are good .",
    "isometric embeddability and hamiltonicity of generalized fibonacci cubes motivated the ideas of the index and parity of a binary word , as defined by ili , klavar , and rho  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider the following fundamental question about the generalized fibonacci cubes : for which binary strings @xmath3 and @xmath8 and positive integers @xmath1 are the generalized fibonacci cubes @xmath0 and @xmath28 isomorphic ?",
    "it is easy to see that if @xmath8 is the binary complement of @xmath3 , or if @xmath8 is the reverse of @xmath3 ( the reverse of @xmath29 is @xmath30 ) , then @xmath4 for any dimension @xmath1 .",
    "hence we say that a pair of binary strings @xmath6 is _ trivial _ if @xmath8 can be obtained from @xmath3 by binary complementation , reversal , or composition of these mappings .",

    "we prove that there exist non - trivial pairs @xmath6 such that @xmath4 and @xmath7 .",
    "we also conjecture that for any non - trivial pair @xmath34 such that @xmath4 , we must have @xmath7 .    the _ autocorrelation polynomial _ @xmath35 associated to a binary string @xmath36 is defined as @xmath37 where @xmath38 if the length @xmath39 suffix of @xmath3 is equal to the length @xmath39 prefix of @xmath3 , i.e. , if @xmath40 , and @xmath41 otherwise",
