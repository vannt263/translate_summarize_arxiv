    "since the end of 2004 , the voyager 1 space probe has been exploring the region of space downstream of the solar wind termination shock , known as the heliosheath ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "observations showed that the heliosheath plasma is generally in a turbulent state @xcite with the mean magnetic field magnitude increasing with heliocentric distance from some 1 @xmath1 g just beyond the shock ( 94 au ) to about 3 @xmath1 g by mid-2012 when the spacecraft was at 122 au from the sun @xcite .",
    "the heliosheath is permeated by energetic ions with energies below several mev , produced inside the heliosphere from interstellar material ( neutral atoms ) and accelerated at the termination shock ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "starting in august of 2012 , the hep intensity experienced a series of rapid drops and increases after which they disappeared altogether @xcite .",
    "the last event was accompanied by a jump in the magnetic field strength from 3 @xmath1 g to 4 @xmath1 g without a change in direction @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the magnetic field became very smooth after crossing the boundary with turbulent fluctuations virtually absent .",
    "such a change in the properties of the magnetic field was expected to happen across the heliopause since it was generally thought that interstellar turbulence existed on vastly greater scales @xcite .",
    "the absence of magnetic field rotation casts some doubt on the interpretation that the boundary just crossed is indeed the heliopause .",
    "it is clear , however , that particle escape along the field lines in the new region is very efficient , which prompted the name `` magnetic highway '' ( mh ) .",
    "it is not clear at this time whether the new region is part of the heliosphere or the interstellar cloud around it , because of the nonfunctional plasma instrument on voyager 1 . in the scenario discussed below this difference",
    "is of no significance as long as the magnetic field remains turbulence free beyond the boundary .    in this letter",
    "we simulate the process of energetic particle crossing from a turbulent region ( the heliosheath ) into a laminar region ( the mh or lism ) .",
    "specifically , we propose an explanation for the observational result that the intensity of particles streaming along the magnetic field decreased faster than those gyrating at nearly @xmath2 angles resulting in a double loss cone pitch - angle distribution @xcite . because the hep intensity changes occurred on short time scales ( i.e. , comparable to @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is voyager 1 speed and @xmath5 is the cyclotron radius of a typical hep ion )",
    ", a model must be capable of resolving scales of @xmath5 and smaller .",
    "a diffusive approach is obviously invalid here because the particle populations were highly anisotropic immediately beyond the boundary . using a fully kinetic approach in a simple numerical model",
    "we show that a flattened pitch - angle distribution is a natural consequence of gyrating particles traveling farther from the boundary before escaping under scatter - free conditions .",
    "the large - scale geometry of our model is illustrated schematically in figure [ fig_draping ] .",
    "we consider a narrow region immediately adjacent to the boundary on either side .",
    "the @xmath6-axis is normal to the boundary and the @xmath7-axis is in the direction of the mean magnetic field .",
    "it is assumed that the magnetic field lines in the mh region are pressed against the boundary for a distance @xmath8 ( the `` connection region '' in fig . [ fig_draping ] )",
    "after which they separate from the boundary .",
    "a particle reaching the end of the connection region is assumed to escape the region and is removed from the system .",
    "the background plasma velocity indirectly measured by voyager 1 was very small during 20102012 @xcite .",
    "for simplicity we assume here that the plasma velocity is zero on both sides of the boundary ( this assumption is not critical as long as the plasma speed is much less than the particle velocity @xmath9 , which is usually satisfied everywhere in the heliosheath ) .",
    "we take the mean field to be @xmath10 @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xmath11 on the heliosheath side , and the mh side of the boundary , respectively .",
    "the general boltzmann equation describing energetic particle transport in a magnetized plasma with turbulent fluctuations may be written as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the phase space density , @xmath1 is the pitch - angle cosine , @xmath15 is the gyrophase , and @xmath16 is the cyclotron frequency .",
    "the operator @xmath17 , describing particle scattering in solid angle , could be obtained from the theory of wave - particle interaction ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the transport across the magnetic field is produced entirely by scattering of the particles in gyrophase .",
    "because the plasma is stationary , there is no electric field and the energy of the particles is assumed to be conserved .    for simplicity",
    "we adopt a model with an isotropic scattering operator , @xmath18 + \\frac{d}{1-\\mu^2}\\frac{\\partial^2f}{\\partial\\varphi^2},\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the scattering coefficient .",
    "the parallel mean free path corresponding to ( 2 ) is @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the scattering rate . for large @xmath22 used here",
    "the transport is predominantly along the magnetic field ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "equation ( 1 ) is solved numerically along the characteristics using a stochastic integration method ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . instead of using eq .",
    "( 2 ) directly , we use the random walk on a sphere technique of @xcite that avoids the singularity at @xmath23 . for small",
    "scattering angles the process is identical to a two - dimensional random walk on a plane .",
    "we performed a series of simulations varying the scattering rates , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and the length of the connection regions @xmath8 , within a sufficiently wide range .",
    "figure [ fig_hpcross ] shows a typical result for 1 mev protons obtained with @xmath26 s@xmath27 , @xmath28 s@xmath27 , and @xmath29 au .",
    "such a large difference in scattering rates is required to produce a noticeable difference between particles traveling at different pitch angles .",
    "the mh region is essentially scatter - free ( @xmath30 au ) and particles are only able to penetrate a distance comparable to @xmath31 au before escaping into the lism .",
    "intensity profiles of @xmath32 and @xmath33 ions are shown with a solid and dashed lines , respectively .",
    "the particle distribution is assumed to be isotropic at the left ( heliosheath ) boundary of the simulation and the two curves are almost identical up to @xmath34 .",
    "afterwards , ions streaming along the magnetic field diminish earlier than ions near @xmath2 pitch angle .",
    "the right ( mh ) boundary plays no role in the simulation because all particles exit the simulation box before reaching it .",
    "the difference in penetration depth is of the order of a cyclotron radius in the mh .",
    "we note that the result remains essentially unchanged if the ratio @xmath35 is kept a constant .",
    "this means that the model applies for larger or smaller scattering rates as long as the unknown escape distance is adjusted accordingly .",
    "figure [ fig_pitch ] plots the hep pitch - angle distributions on the heliosheath side at @xmath36 au ( solid line ) and on the mh side at @xmath37 au ( dashed line ) .",
    "the initially isotropic ion population becomes highly anisotropic past the boundary as it becomes depleted in @xmath23 particles .",
    "some @xmath33 particles have also scattered and escaped from the system , so that the total intensity is significantly reduced .",
    "this result is consistent with voyager 1 observations showing a flattened ( pancake like ) pitch - angle ion distribution beyond the boundary @xcite .",
    "in this letter we proposed a simple model to explain the double loss cone type distributions of mev heliosheath particles observed immediately beyond the boundary crossed by voyager 1 in 2012 .",
    "the model is based on a concept that particle scattering rates are much smaller in the mh region than in the heliosheath .",
    "particles gyrating near @xmath32 are able to penetrate deeper into the new region because of their larger gyro - radius , whereas particles streaming along the field rapidly escape into the lism .",
    "the model does not require magnetic mirrors on either side of the voyager crossing point , but only that there exist a boundary magnetic connection region of considerable extent ( a few tens of au ) .",
    "our model is unrelated to the concept proposed by @xcite , where the drop in energetic particle flux is a consequence of voyager 1 leaving the region magnetically connected to the termination shock .",
    "our very simple model qualitatively reproduces the observed changes in particle distribution across the boundary . the same model",
    "may be applied to ions with higher and lower energies by adjusting the scattering rate accordingly .",
    "the contrast between particles traveling at 0 and @xmath2 pitch angles in our model appears to be less than observed .",
    "this is primarily due to a strictly perpendicular magnetic field geometry used here .",
    "the model therefore lacks diffusive transport across the magnetic field from magnetic field line meandering .",
    "a proper statistical treatment of this effect on kinetic scales requires a prescription of the complete three - dimensional turbulent magnetic field , which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "magnetic field line diffusion would make particle intensity decrease at a slower rate .",
    "consequently , the heps may be still around several @xmath5 deep into the mh region .",
    "another simplification is our use of a very thin boundary between the two regions .",
    "the boundary could be diffuse and/or turbulent , which would also make the hep intensity decrease slower than predicted here .",
    "it should be pointed out that the true radial extent of the particle decrease region is unknown because of a large uncertainty in the background plasma speed measurement .",
    "if the flow was slightly anti - sunward , the region could be very thin ( perhaps of the order of @xmath5 ) .",
    "irrespective to this result , we think that the basic premise of our model ( particle escape into the lism at different rates ) adequately describes the fundamental physics of the newly discovered boundary ."
