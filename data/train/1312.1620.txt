    "light metal hydride mgh@xmath0 is one of the most promising hydrogen - storage materials for on - board clean - fuel application , because it has both high gravimetric ( 7.7wt% ) and volumetric densities ( 6.7@xmath6 10@xmath7 ) @xcite .",
    "however , their dehydrogenation process is too slow to be practically useful , and for bulk materials as high as about 300 k above room temperature is required to obtain an equilibrium h@xmath0 pressure of 1 bar @xcite .",
    "such poor dehydrogenation kinetics is primarily due to the strong ionic bonding between mg and h and large enthalpy of formation of mgh@xmath0 ( @xmath8 75kj / molh@xmath0 ) , as evidenced by both experiments @xcite and first - principles calculations @xcite .",
    "various attempts have been made to help facilitate dehydrogenation process .",
    "for example , to improve the kinetics , ball milling processing @xcite has been used to shorten the diffusion length , doping of transition metals @xcite were adopted to reduce the strength of h - mg bond , and applying tensile stress was tried to weaken the mg - h stability @xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", doping has been known to enhance h diffusion in metal hydrides , which is usually mediated by h vacancy , by inducing a higher concentration of h - vacancy @xcite .",
    "for example , van de walle _ et . al _ recognized that in certain charged state , zr(ti ) can enhance the dehydrogenation kinetics of naalh@xmath9 @xcite , because the formation energy of h - vacancy is decreased upon doping .",
    "in particular , when the h - vacancy is charged , its formation energy depends on the position of fermi energy ; and conversely , selective doping of the hydride with impurities that take different charged states will tune the fermi energy with respect to the dopant - free system . and the shift of fermi energy can result in a decrease of h - vacancy formation energy depending on the sign of the h - vacancy charge state . consequently , the concentration of h - vacancy will increase to enhance the vacancy - mediated h diffusion .    in this work , we investigated the effects of li doping on h diffusion in mgh@xmath0 .",
    "one important reason that we chose li is because it is a lighter metal than mg , so that it will not degrade the high h gravimetric density .",
    "we focused on the effects of charge state of li impurity and h - vacancy , as recognized before in other systems@xcite , but also went beyond the previous works by taking into account the effects of interaction between the charged impurities and defects .",
    "in many previous studies of the charged - impurity - enhanced h diffusion@xcite , it implicitly assumed no interaction between the dopant and defect .",
    "this might be true in the limit of low doping concentration and weak defect - dopant interaction , but unlikely at high doping concentration . especially , if there is an attractive impurity - defect interaction , such as the binding between the li - dopant and h - vacancy in mgh@xmath0 as shown by smith _",
    "@xcite , the impurity may immobilize the h - vacancy , counteracting the enhancement effect of h - vacancy on h diffusion .",
    "therefore , by taking into account the binding between li and h - vacancy and its dependence on the charge states of li and h - vacancy , we have systematically studied the effects of li doping on h diffusion in mgh@xmath0 as a function of li concentration .",
    "we have determined the favored charge states of li by calculating its formation energy as a function of fermi energy , the equilibrium concentration of h vacancies by calculating the h vacancy formation energy as a function of li doping concentration , and the percentage of immobilized h - vacancies by calculating the binding energies between h - vacancy and li - dopant .",
    "we have also calculated the diffusion barrier of h - vacancy in the presence of li dopant .",
    "our first principles calculations based on density functional theory ( dft ) were conducted using projector augment wave pseudopotential ( paw ) @xcite with the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) @xcite to the exchange - correlation functional , as implemented in vasp package @xcite .",
    "supercell technique was used to calculate the formation energy of defects and dopants , interaction energy and diffusion barrier .",
    "we used a supercell comprised of @xmath10 primitive mgh@xmath0 rutile unit cells with the dimensions of @xmath11 .",
    "400 ev energy cutoff and @xmath12 k - mesh were used for wavefuntion expansion and k - space integration , respectively .",
    "all the structures were relaxed in terms of internal atomic coordinates using conjugate gradient method until the force exerted on each atom was smaller than @xmath13 .",
    "the charged system was simulated by adding to or removing from the system electrons with a compensating uniform opposite charge background .",
    "diffusion barrier was calculated using the nudged elastic band method @xcite .",
    "the formation energy @xmath14 of defect or dopant ( @xmath15 ) with charge q was computed according to ref.@xcite : @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the total energies of supercell for pure mgh@xmath0 and for mgh@xmath0 containing defect or dopant ( @xmath19 ) , respectively .",
    "@xmath20 is chosen to be the valence band maximum ( vbm ) energy .",
    "@xmath21 is the fermi energy with respect to @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath22 is additional electrostatic energy alignment due to different energy references between the defect - containing structure and defect - free structure .",
    "@xmath23 denotes h - defect or dopant li and @xmath24 is the number of species @xmath23 in the supercell .",
    "@xmath25 is the chemical potential of species @xmath23 . in low concentration limit",
    ", the equilibrium defect concentration can be related to the formation energy using : @xmath26 n is the number of sites that can be occupied by defect , @xmath27 is boltzman constant and t is temperature in k.    for the chemical potential @xmath25 , the externally added dopant li is assumed to have its bulk chemical potential @xmath28 .",
    "the chemical potential of h , @xmath29 is in between @xmath30 ( h - poor condition ) and @xmath31 ( h - rich condition ) , considering thermodynamic equilibrium between mgh@xmath0 , mg and h@xmath0 .",
    "@xmath32 is enthalpy of formation of mgh@xmath0 , e(h@xmath0 ) is the energy of hydrogen molecule at 0 k. similarily , the chemical potential of mg is in between e(bulk mg ) and e(bulk mg)+@xmath33h@xmath34(mgh@xmath0 ) .",
    "we specifically considered two extreme cases : h poor condition and h rich condition .",
    "first we calculated the formation energy of native defects : h - vacancy ( v@xmath35 with charge -1 , 0 , + 1 ) and interstitial h ( h@xmath36 with charge -1 , 0 , + 1 ) .",
    "the preferred defects are @xmath37 and @xmath38 in h - poor condition , and @xmath37 and @xmath39 in h - rich condition , respectively .",
    "charge neutrality condition requires fermi - energy to be 2.85 ev and 2.65 ev for the h - poor condition and h - poor condition , respectively .",
    "these results are in good agreement with those for mgh@xmath0 in ref .",
    "@xcite . in table [ tablec ] we give an estimate of the concentration for the favored h - defects from equation ( [ concentration ] ) .",
    "formation energy of li - dopant in mgh@xmath0:(a ) h - poor condition .",
    "( b ) h - rich condition .",
    "the vertical solid and dashed lines indicate the fermi energy in mgh@xmath0 with and without li , respectively .",
    "e@xmath40=0 ev corresponds to the vbm and e@xmath40=3.8 ev corresponds to the cbm . ]    in order to study how the formation energies of the h - related defects are affected by li doping , we then calculated the formation energy for both substitutional li configuration ( li@xmath41 ) and interstitial li configuration ( li@xmath36 ) in the ( -1 , 0 , + 1 ) charge states . as shown in figure [ fig1 ] for both h - poor and h - rich conditions",
    ", li@xmath4 is more stable than li@xmath42 and li@xmath43 in almost the whole range of fermi energy in the gap except very close to the vbm . while li@xmath5 is more stable than other two charge states in almost the whole range of fermi energy in the gap except very close to conduction band minimum ( cbm ) .",
    "this indicates that the defect level remains close to the vbm and cbm for li@xmath41 and li@xmath36 , respectively ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for similar behavior of native defects in anatase tio@xmath0 ) . under the charge - neutrality condition ,",
    "the fermi energy of the li - doped system ( vertical solid lines ) is shifted to the left by 0.25 ev ( fig .",
    "1(a ) ) and 0.39 ev ( fig .",
    "1(b ) ) with respect to the fermi energy of the undoped system ( vertical dashed lines ) for the h - poor and h - rich condition , respectively , assuming the concentration of dopant li is much higher than that of h - defects so that the li@xmath5 and li@xmath4 are the dominant charged dopants to maintain the charge - neutrality condiction .",
    "the fermi energy in both situations is deep inside the band gap .",
    "thus , the thermally excited free carriers in both valence and conduction band are negligible .",
    "the consequence of the shift of fermi energy is that the formation energy of v@xmath2 is reduced by 0.25 ev and 0.39 ev under the h - poor and h - rich condition , respectively , according to eq .",
    "( 1 ) . and",
    "the opposite effect happens to v@xmath44 and h@xmath45 : their formation energy is increased by 0.25 ev and 0.39 ev , respectively . as shown in table",
    "[ tablec ] , at 400k the concentration of v@xmath2 in the li - doped system is 1.40@xmath610@xmath46 and 8.12@xmath610@xmath47 times larger than that in the undoped system under the h - poor and h - rich condition , respectively . on the contrary , the concentration of h@xmath45 in the li - doped system is @xmath810@xmath48 and @xmath49 times lower than that in the undoped system under the h - poor and h - rich condition , respectively .",
    "a previous calculation@xcite showed that in the undoped mgh@xmath0 the diffusion barrier of @xmath37 is 0.25 ev smaller than that of @xmath38 under the h - poor condition , and the diffusion barrier of @xmath37 is 0.36 ev higher than that of h@xmath45 under the h - rich condition .",
    "this means that without li doping , the @xmath37 is the dominant diffusing species under the h - poor condition , while the h@xmath45 is the dominant diffusing species under the h - rich condition .",
    "our calculations show that upon li doping , the formation energy of @xmath37 is decreased by 0.25 ev under that h - poor condition , while that of h@xmath45 is increased by 0.39 ev under h - rich condition . because the h - related defect diffusion is determined by the activation barrier , which is the sum of the diffusion barrier and the formation energy .",
    "the @xmath37 remains the dominant diffusing species under the h - poor condition because its formation energy is decreased , leading to a lower activation barrier .",
    "in contrast , the h@xmath45 becomes the less favorable diffusing species under the h - rich condition because its formation energy is increased , leading to a higher activation barrier .",
    "consequently , the li doping makes the @xmath37 the dominant diffusion species in the whole range of h chemical potential .",
    "we note that we have neglected entropy contribution in our analysis .",
    "usually , this is a good approximation because the contribution due to the entropy difference is much smaller than the contribution due to the total energy difference .",
    "of course , more accurate results can be obtained by calculating the phonon spectra of all the mgh@xmath0 systems and h@xmath0 . on the other hand , for the mgh@xmath0 system we consider",
    ", it has been shown that even though h has a low mass , but the vibrational entropies for h in the lattice and in the h@xmath0 reservoir are rather similar and hence the net entropy difference is small @xcite .",
    "also we have used a relatively large supercell dimension so that the added defect charge density in the supercell is very low .",
    "consequently , the interaction energy between the charged defects in the neighboring cells is expected to be sufficiently small , not to affect our conclusion .",

    "however , we did nt consider the interaction between v@xmath50 and li@xmath4 .",
    "next , we calculated the attractive interaction energy between v@xmath50 and li@xmath4 as a function of their separation as shown in fig . [ binding ] .",
    "we did nt consider the interaction between v@xmath50 and li@xmath5 because it is repulsive .",
    "two key features are found in fig .",
    "[ binding](b ) : ( 1 ) v@xmath50 prefers to sit in one of the six nearest - neighbor h - sites ( site 1 and site 2 in fig .",
    "[ binding](a ) ) of li with binding energy of 0.50 - 0.55 ev ; ( 2 ) once beyond the nearest - neighbor h - site , their attraction decays rapidly to be insignificant .",
    "based on this observation , we propose a nearest - neighbor interaction model to determine how many v@xmath50 being trapped by li@xmath4 as a function of li doping concentration .",

    "[ binding](c ) shows the calculated r@xmath63 as a function of li doping concentration .",
    "we see that even in the low concentration ( for example , @xmath64 ) , the trapping ratio r@xmath63 is very close to one , indicating that almost all the v@xmath50 next to li are immobilized due to their attractive interaction .",
    "this also indicates that h vacancy prefers to stay next to li@xmath4 , because its formation energy is effectively decreased by 0.55 ev .     to diffuse away further way from li site .",

    "the purple ball indicates the position of v@xmath35 in our calculation .",
    "the arrow indicates the diffusion path ]    furthermore , we studied kinetically how h - vacancy diffusion is affected by the presence of li@xmath41 through the calculation of diffusion barriers . in fig .",
    "3 , we show the barriers for the h - vacancy diffusing from the nearest - neighbor sites of li ( sites 1 and 2 in fig .",
    "3(a ) ) to its closest h site ( sites 4 and 5 ) ( path 1 ) and from the next nearest - neighbor site ( site 3 ) to its closet h site ( site 5 ) ( path 2 ) . for the path 1",
    ", the diffusion barrier is found to increase by 0.15 ev compared to that in the undoped mgh@xmath0 .",
    "for the path 2 , the diffusion barrier is found only @xmath6530 mev higher than that in the undoped mgh@xmath0 .",
    "this strong site dependence of h - vacancy diffusion barrier is consistent with the fast decay of the attractive interaction between v@xmath35 and li@xmath41 as shown in fig .",
    "the 0.15 ev increase of diffusion barrier , together with the large v@xmath35 trapping ratio suggest that h vacancies will mostly be immobilized in the vicinity of li dopants , inhibiting the v@xmath35 mediated h diffusion .",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated the effects of li - doping in mgh@xmath0 on the h - vacancy meditated h - diffusion , using dft calculations .",
    "the formation energy calculation shows that the li dopant favors two charged configurations of li@xmath4 and li@xmath5 .",
    "the charge neutrality condition requires the fermi energy be shifted towards the vbm by 0.25 ev and 0.39 ev upon li doping under the h - poor and h - rich conditions , respectively , which decreases the formation energy of v@xmath50 by the same amount .",
    "this leads to an increase of v@xmath50 concentration by up to about 5 orders of magnitude at t=400 k. furthermore , the calculations of interaction energy between v@xmath2 and li@xmath4 as well as diffusion barrier of h vacancy in the presence of li show that almost all the h - vacancy next to li are immobilized .",
    "therefore , the h - diffusion is enhanced by li doping in mgh@xmath0 only at the low li doping concentration but not at the high concentration .",
