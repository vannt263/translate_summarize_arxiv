    "of particular importance in modern accelerators and storage rings operating at high beam currents and charge densities are the effects of the intense self - fields produced by the beam space charge and current on determining detailed equilibrium , stability and transport properties . in general , a complete description of collective processes in intense charged particle beams is provided by the vlasov - maxwell equations for the self - consistent evolution of the beam distribution function and the electromagnetic fields . as shown in @xcite in the case of a sheet beam with constant phase - space density the vlasov - maxwell equations are fully equivalent to a warm - fluid model with zero heat flow and triple - adiabatic equation - of - state .    in the present paper",
    "we demonstrate that starting from the hydrodynamic equations , and using the renormalization group ( rg ) technique @xcite a nonlinear schroedinger equation for the slowly varying single - wave amplitude can be derived .",
    "the renormalized solution for the beam density describes the process of formation of periodic _ holes _ in intense particle beams .",
    "we begin with the hydrodynamic model derived in @xcite @xmath0    @xmath1    @xmath2    here @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the normalized density and the current velocity , respectively , @xmath5 is the periodic focusing lattice coefficient , @xmath6 is the normalized thermal speed - squared , and @xmath7 is a constant coefficient @xcite , where @xmath8 is the area density of sheet beam particles , and @xmath9 is the constant phase - space density .",
    "moreover , @xmath10 is the normalized self - field potential @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the electrostatic ( space - charge ) potential , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the rest mass and charge of a beam particle , and @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the relative particle velocity and lorentz factor , respectively . finally , the quantity @xmath17 is the normalized self - field perveance defined by @xmath18 in what follows the analysis is restricted to the smooth focusing approximation @xmath19 and assume that there exist nontrivial stationary solutions to ( [ hydrodynamic ] ) in the interval @xmath20 , and that the sheet beam density is zero @xmath21 outside of the interval .",
    "the change of variables @xmath22 enables us to rewrite ( [ hydrodynamic ] ) in the form @xmath23",
    "@xmath24 @xmath25 clearly , the system ( [ hydrodyn ] ) possesses a stationary solution @xmath26 here , the uniform density @xmath27 is normalized according to @xmath28",
    "following the basic idea of the rg method , we represent the solution to equations ( [ hydrodyn ] ) in the form of a standard perturbation expansion @xcite in a formal small parameter @xmath29 as @xmath30 @xmath31 before proceeding with explicit calculations order by order , we note that in all orders the perturbation equations acquire the general form @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 where the functions @xmath35 and @xmath36 involve contributions from previous orders and are considered known . eliminating @xmath37 and @xmath38 , it is possible to obtain a single equation for @xmath39 alone , i.e. , @xmath40 it is evident that in first order @xmath41 . imposing the condition @xmath42 which means that linear perturbation to the uniform stationary density @xmath27 should average to zero and not affect the normalization properties on the interval @xmath43",
    ", we obtain the first - order solution @xmath44 here , @xmath45 are constant complex wave amplitudes , and the following conventions and notations @xmath46 have been introduced .",
    "moreover , the discrete mode frequencies @xmath47 are determined from the dispersion relation @xmath48 in addition , the first - order solution for the current velocity and for the self - field potential can be expressed as @xmath49 @xmath50 in obtaining the second - order perturbation equation ( [ basicrhon ] ) , we note that @xmath51 thus the second - order solution for the density @xmath52 is found to be @xmath53 } } ,   \\label{solrho2}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 @xmath55 } ,   \\label{alphamkpm}\\ ] ] @xmath56 having determined @xmath57 , the second - order current velocity @xmath58 can be found in a straightforward manner .",
    "the result is @xmath59 } } ,   \\label{solv2}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 in third order , the functions @xmath61 and @xmath62 entering the right - hand - side of equation ( [ basicrhon ] ) can be calculated utilizing the already determined quantities from the first and second orders , according to @xmath63 @xmath64 it is important to note that the right - hand - side of equation ( [ basicrhon ] ) for @xmath65 contains terms which yield oscillating terms with constant amplitudes to the solution for @xmath65 . apart from these",
    ", there is a resonant term ( proportional to @xmath66 ) leading to a secular contribution . to complete the renormalization group reduction of the hydrodynamic equations , we select this particular resonant third - order term on the right - hand - side of equation ( [ basicrhon ] ) .",
    "the latter can be written as @xmath67 @xmath68 where @xmath69 @xmath70}.   \\label{gammamk}\\ ] ] some straightforward algebra yields the solution for @xmath71 to equation ( [ basicrhon ] ) in the form @xmath72 where the dots stand for non - secular oscillating terms .",
    "moreover , the amplitude @xmath73 is secular and satisfies the equation @xmath74 where the operator @xmath75 is defined by @xmath76 we can now construct the perturbative solution for @xmath77 up to third order in the small parameter @xmath29 .",
    "confining attention to the constant stationary density @xmath27 and the fundamental modes ( first harmonic in the phase @xmath78 ) , we obtain @xmath79 } e^{i \\chi_m   { \\left ( \\xi ; s \\right)}}.    \\label{solrhogen}\\ ] ] following the basic philosophy of the rg method , we introduce the intermediate coordinate @xmath80 and `` time '' @xmath81 and transform equation ( [ solrhogen ] ) to @xmath82 @xmath83 }   \\right\\ } } e^{i \\chi_m { \\left ( \\xi ; s \\right)}}.    \\label{solrhoren}\\ ] ] note that the transition from equation ( [ solrhogen ] ) to equation ( [ solrhoren ] ) can always be performed by enforcing the constant amplitude @xmath45 to be dependent on @xmath80 and @xmath81 , which is in fact the procedure for renormalizing the standard perturbation result .",
    "since the general solution for @xmath84 should not depend on @xmath80 and @xmath81 , by applying the operator @xmath85 [ which is the same as that in equation ( [ operatlm ] ) but with @xmath86 and @xmath87 on both sides of equation ( [ solrhoren ] ) , we obtain @xmath88 where we have dropped the formal parameter @xmath29 on the right - hand - side . since the above equation should hold true for any choice of @xmath80 and @xmath81 , we can set @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "thus , we obtain the so - called proto rg equation @xcite @xmath91 introducing the new variable @xmath92 and neglecting the second order derivatives @xmath93 and @xmath94 , we finally arrive at the rg equation for the @xmath95-th mode amplitude @xmath96",
    "equation ( [ rgequation ] ) represents a system of coupled nonlinear schroedinger equations for the mode amplitudes . neglecting the contribution from modes with @xmath97 , for a single mode amplitude @xmath45",
    ", we obtain the equation @xmath98 where @xmath99 it is easy to verify that @xmath100 is always positive . in nonlinear optics equation ( [ nschroedeq ] ) is known to describe the formation and evolution of the so - called _ dark solitons _ @xcite . in the case of charged particle beams",
    "these correspond to the formation of _ holes _ or _ cavitons _ in the beam .",
    "since the renormalized solution for the beam density @xmath84 can be expressed as @xmath101 these holes have periodic structure in space @xmath102 and `` time '' @xmath103 .",
    "based on the renormalization group method , a system of coupled nonlinear schroedinger equations has been derived for the slowly varying amplitudes of interacting beam - density waves . under the approximation of an isolated wave neglecting the effect of the rest of the waves , this system reduces to a single nonlinear schroedinger equation with repulsive nonlinearity .",
    "the latter describes the formation and evolution of holes in intense charged particle beams .",
    "we are indebted to e. startsev for many illuminating discussions concerning the subject of the present paper .",
    "it is also a pleasure to thank y. oono for careful reading of the manuscript and for making valuable suggestions .",
