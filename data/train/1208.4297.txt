    "establishing an interparticle hamiltonian , which is the fundamental ingredient for microscopic many - body calculations of atomic nuclei and nucleonic matter , is a difficult and on - going challenge for low - energy nuclear physics .",
    "chiral eft and rg methods make feasible a controlled description of nuclear interactions , grounded in qcd symmetries , which in turn makes possible the description of nuclei across the nuclear many - body landscape  @xcite .",
    "the two - body sector has been solved in the sense that various nucleon - nucleon interactions are available that reproduce low - energy scattering phase shifts to high accuracy .",
    "the unsettled frontier is three- and higher - body forces , which play a key role in many - nucleon systems .",
    "nuclear structure calculations are complicated due to the coupling of low to high momenta by nuclear interactions .",
    "a fruitful path to decoupling high - momentum from low - momentum physics is the similarity renormalization group ( srg ) , which is based on a continuous sequence of unitary transformations that suppress off - diagonal matrix elements .",
    "the decoupling of momenta via the srg has been demonstrated for nuclear nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interactions  @xcite and very recently for the first time also for three - nucleon forces ( 3nf )  @xcite .",
    "the decoupling in 3nf is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:3nf_decoupling ] : at large resolution scales @xmath0 the potential contains significant off - diagonal couplings . as we evolve to lower resolution",
    ", these couplings get successively suppressed and finally at @xmath1 the non - perturbative features are substantially softened as we find only non - vanishing strength at small momenta and around the diagonal .",
    "srg - evolved potentials are automatically energy independent and the same transformations renormalize all operators , including many - body operators , and the class of transformations can be tailored for effectiveness in particular problems . when evolving nuclear interactions to lower resolution , it is inevitable that many - body interactions and operators are induced even if initially absent .",
    "this might be considered as unnatural if nuclei could be accurately calculated based on only nn interactions , as was assumed for much of the history of nuclear structure calculations .",
    "however , chiral eft reveals the natural scale and hierarchy of many - body forces , which dictates their inclusion in modern calculations of nuclei and nucleonic matter .     and @xmath2 for a fixed hyperangle .",

    "progress towards controlled nuclear matter calculations has long been hindered by the non - perturbative nature of the nuclear many - body problem when conventional nuclear potentials are used .",
    "the novel developments described above open new ways to overcome these obstacles .",
    "calculations of finite nuclei based on consistently evolved nn _ and _ 3n potentials are now available ( see refs .",
    "such fully consistent calculations of the nuclear equation of state do not easily follow , but the framework recently presented in ref .",
    "@xcite makes them likely in the near future .    as an alternative simplified strategy",
    "it is also possible to evolve only the nn interactions with rg methods and then fix the the short - range parameters of the 3n forces from fits to few - body systems at the low - momentum scale  @xcite .",
    "this procedure assumes that the long - range part of the 3n forces remains invariant under the rg transformations and that the operator structure of the chiral interaction is a sufficiently complete basis so that induced contributions can be absorbed to good approximation . as shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : eos_snm_pnm ] , we find realistic saturation properties within our theoretical uncertainty bounds without adjustment of free parameters .",
    "the two pairs of curves show the difference between the nuclear matter results for nn - only and nn plus 3n interactions .",
    "it is evident that saturation is driven by 3nf . even for @xmath3 , which is similar to the lower cutoffs in chiral eft potentials ,",
    "saturation is at too high density without the 3nf .",

    "only the long - range 2@xmath4-exchange 3nf contribute  @xcite , which implies that all three- and four - neutron ( 4n ) forces are predicted up to n@xmath5lo .",
    "the physics of neutron matter ranges from the universal regime at low densities that can be probed in experiments with ultracold atoms up to high densities relevant for the structure of neutron stars . for these extreme conditions , controlled calculations with theoretical error estimates",
    "are essential . as a result of effective range effects , restricted phase space at finite density and weaker tensor forces between neutrons neutron matter behaves more perturbative than symmetric nuclear matter . in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : eos_snm_pnm ] we present results for neutron matter based directly on chiral eft interactions without rg evolution including all nn , 3n and 4n contributions up to n@xmath5lo  @xcite . we find relatively large attractive contributions from n@xmath5lo 3n forces , which might be an indication that a chiral eft with explicit @xmath6 degrees of freedom may be more efficient  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , contributions from 4n interactions appear to be very small in neutron matter .",
    "core densities inside a neutron star can reach several times nuclear saturation density .",
    "for this reason , we need to extend the microscopically calculated eoss to higher densities .",
    "to do so we use a general strategy which does not rely on assumptions about the nature of the constituents of the matter and their interactions at higher densities : we employ a piecewise polytopic ansatz @xmath7  @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) , whereas the values of the parameters are limited by physics and constraints from observations . as constraints",
    "we require that ( a ) the speed of sound remains smaller than the speed of light for all densities , and ( b ) the eos is able to support a neutron star of mass @xmath8 , where the value of @xmath9 is given by experimental neutron star observations . for @xmath9",
    "we consider two cases : first , @xmath10 , which is currently the heaviest confirmed observed neutron star mass  @xcite , and second , a hypothetical mass @xmath11 .",
    "we generate a very large number of eoss for different values of parameters and retain only those which fullfill the causality and mass conditions .",
    "this results in uncertainty bands for the pressure and neutron star radii , which are shown in fig .",

    "recent experimental studies of proton knock - out reactions off nuclei at high - momentum transfer have been explained by invoking short - range correlations ( src ) in nuclear systems  @xcite .",
    "such explanations may seem at odds with rg evolution , which leads to many - body wave functions with highly suppressed src .",
    "the key is that not only the hamiltonian but every other operator must also evolve .",
    "recent advances make it possible to systematically evolve operators using the srg as shown in ref .",

    "we choose as initial hamiltonian the highly non - perturbative argonne v18 nn potential and evolve consistently density operator and hamiltonian via the srg , each truncated at the two - body level .",
    "as shown in the left panel , already at this level of approximation , the pair momentum distribution function is invariant to good approximation in back - to - back kinematics , in contrast to the case without operator evolution ( dotted lines ) .",
    "in addition , we are also able to reproduce the enhancement of neutron - proton pairs over neutron - neutron pairs due to the tensor interaction of the initial hamiltonian ( see right panel ) . furthermore , in the present kinematic conditions there is factorization of the unitary transformation , which leads to significant simplifications and an alternative interpretation of the universal high - momentum dependence and scaling  @xcite .",
