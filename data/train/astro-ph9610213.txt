    "the traditional method for obtaining masses and orbital parameters of binary pulsars consists of fitting keplerian or post - newtonian models to timing data covering at least one complete orbit . for wide - orbit binary pulsars , with orbital periods",
    "longer than a few years to decades , fitting a complete orbit may not be possible .",
    "for such systems , we present a method for obtaining the masses and orbital parameters using measured values of the successive time derivatives of the pulse frequency ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , etc . ) . given the high precision of millisecond pulsar timing it is sometimes possible to measure these frequency derivatives up to high order with only a few years of observations .",
    "we show below that with _ five derivatives _ a complete solution may be obtained , with the orbital parameters and companion mass fully determined up to the usual unknown inclination factor @xmath1 .",
    "this solution is constructed under the assumption that all frequency derivatives are _ dynamically induced _ rather than being intrinsic to the pulsar spin - down .",
    "this is a crucial assumption which may not always be justified .",
    "its validity , and the effects of relaxing it , must be examined for each particular application .",
    "if only three or four derivatives have been measured , significant constraints can still be placed on the parameters of the system . with just three dynamically - induced derivatives and the assumption of a circular orbit ( often justified , e.g. , for a planet ) a complete solution",
    "can again be obtained .",
    "our method is not a substitute for the standard fitting procedure to data covering a complete orbit .",
    "instead , it provides a way of obtaining the orbital parameters of wide - orbit binaries which can not be observed over a complete orbit due to their very long orbital periods .",
    "the method can only be successfully applied to binaries containing fast millisecond pulsars with low timing noise , in which one can reasonably expect the dynamically - induced pulse frequency derivatives to dominate over intrinsic changes .    applications of our method to two systems , psr  b1620@xmath1226 and psr  b1257@xmath612 , will be presented in this paper .",
    "both of these systems are thought to contain planetary - mass companions to the millisecond pulsar ( wolszczan 1994 ; arzoumanian 1996 ) .",
    "their properties are of great interest for our understanding of planet formation outside the solar system .",
    "this is particularly true in light of the many recent detections of extrasolar planets around nearby stars , which show a great diversity of properties ( mayor & queloz 1995 ; butler & marcy 1996 ; marcy & butler 1996 ) .",
    "psr  b1620@xmath1226 , in the globular cluster m4 , is in a hierarchical triple configuration .",
    "previously available timing data allowed a second companion mass anywhere in the range @xmath13@xmath14 ( michel 1994 ; sigurdsson 1995 ) , i.e. , including the possibility of a jupiter - type planet .",
    "psr  b1257@xmath612 has three confirmed low - mass planets , and there is recent evidence for a fourth more massive one ( wolszczan 1996 ) .    our paper is organized as follows . in  2 , we describe our general method for obtaining the companion mass and the orbital parameters using measured pulse frequency derivatives . in  3 ,",
    "we apply our method to psr  b1620@xmath1226 .",
    "we also incorporate into our analysis preliminary measurements of secular perturbations of the inner binary by performing monte - carlo simulations with the undetermined parameters in the system to obtain the most probable mass for the second companion . in  4 , we apply our method to check whether the observed frequency derivatives of psr  1257@xmath612 are consistent with the possible existence of a fourth object in the planetary system .",
    "in the standard method for determining the parameters of binary pulsars , the data ( consisting of radio pulse arrival times ) are fitted to the predictions of a keplerian or post - newtonian model of the binary orbit . to obtain a reliable fit",
    ", one usually needs timing data covering at least a few complete orbital periods .",
    "however , even if the data do not cover a full period , it is still possible to determine , at least approximately , the companion mass and orbital parameters of the system if sufficiently accurate timing data are available .",
    "the method we develop here uses time derivatives of the pulse frequency ( basically the coefficients in a taylor expansion of the pulse frequency around a particular epoch ) .",
    "pulse frequency derivatives are a convenient way in which radio astronomers can present the results of their observations when a clear periodicity can not be recognized in the timing data .      assuming that the pulsar mass ( @xmath15 ) is known , there are five parameters that can in principle be determined using our method : the mass of the companion @xmath2 ( up to the unknown inclination angle @xmath16 ) , the semi - major axis @xmath17 , the eccentricity @xmath18 , the longitude of pericenter @xmath19 ( measured from the ascending node ) and the longitude @xmath20 of the companion at the reference epoch ( measured from pericenter ) .",
    "the inclination angle @xmath16 is the angle between the normal to the orbital plane and the line of sight ; this angle can not be determined directly from the timing data . here and throughout this paper",
    "a subscript  1 refers to the pulsar , a subscript  2 refers to the companion , and all orbital elements correspond to the motion around the center of mass of the system ( e.g. , the distance between the pulsar and its companion is @xmath21 ) .",
    "if frequency derivatives up to the _ fifth order _ are measured , all five parameters ( @xmath2 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) can in principle be determined . for small values of @xmath22",
    "the usual combination @xmath23 can be obtained ( see the discussion for psr  b1620@xmath1226 in  3 ) . for larger companion masses , the dependence of the solutions on @xmath16 is more complicated and one needs to adopt a particular value of @xmath24 ( in practice @xmath25 for a random orientation ) in order to solve explicitly for @xmath2 .",
    "our method assumes that the measured frequency derivatives are purely those induced by the motion of the pulsar ( acceleration , jerk , and higher derivatives ) around the binary center of mass .",
    "this requires correcting the measurements for other possible kinematic effects ( see , e.g. , camilo 1994 ) .",
    "more importantly , one must assume that any intrinsic contribution from the pulsar spin - down can be neglected , or determined to some extent from the known properties of other millisecond pulsars and subtracted from the measured values .",
    "in particular , the observed first frequency derivative @xmath9 is in general determined by a combination of acceleration and intrinsic spin - down of the pulsar , @xmath26 it is not possible to measure the two components separately in general . for some systems",
    ", however , it is reasonable to assume that @xmath27 if @xmath28 is large .",
    "for example , the observed @xmath29 may be positive , a clear sign that it is determined predominantly by acceleration ( as in the m15 pulsars psr 2127 + 11  a and  d ; wolszczan et al .",
    "the expected value of @xmath30 may also be estimated from the pulse frequency @xmath31 and from the assumption that the timing age @xmath32 of a millisecond pulsar should satisfy @xmath33 .",
    "indeed most millisecond pulsars with reliably measured timing ages appear to satisfy this property ( e.g. , phinney & kulkarni 1994 ) .",
    "note that the true ages of some millisecond pulsars may be considerably smaller ( cf .",
    "lorimer 1995 ) , but this does not affect our argument .",
    "similarly , the expected value of @xmath34 can be estimated from the predicted level of _ timing noise _ for the pulsar , which , although very small for millisecond pulsars , may also affect the interpretation of @xmath35 ( see , e.g. , arzoumanian 1994 ; kaspi 1994 ) .",
    "intrinsic higher derivatives ( @xmath11 , etc . ) are normally not measurable for millisecond pulsars , and therefore we can always assume safely that any measured values are dynamically induced .",
    "after subtraction of known kinematic and intrinsic contributions , we can write the time derivatives of the pulse frequency at a particular reference epoch as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the speed of light , @xmath38 is the acceleration of the pulsar , and @xmath39 is a unit vector in the direction of the line of sight , and a dot indicates a time derivative . the second term in the expression for @xmath10 is smaller than the first by a factor @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the orbital velocity of the neutron star , i.e. , @xmath42 . for @xmath11 , we have @xmath43 , etc .",
    ", so that all similar terms can be neglected in taking higher and higher derivatives . therefore , we can write the first five frequency derivatives simply as @xmath44 equations ( 3 ) form a system of five nonlinear algebraic equations with five unknowns ( @xmath2 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath20 , and @xmath19 ) which must be solved numerically .",
    "it is straightforward but tedious to write down explicitly the right - hand sides of these equations in terms of the five unknowns , and we will omit their explicit forms in the general case . some of the steps involved , however , are described below in  2.2 .",
    "when four derivatives ( @xmath9 through @xmath45 ) are known , one can obtain a one - parameter family of solutions . in practice",
    ", the problem can be reduced to solving a system of _ three _ nonlinear equations as follows .",
    "if @xmath46 is the mass of the pulsar , and @xmath2 is the mass of the companion , the acceleration of the pulsar in its motion around the center of mass of the binary is of magnitude @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the distance from the pulsar to the center of mass and @xmath49 for an elliptic keplerian orbit of semimajor axis @xmath50 and eccentricity @xmath51 , the distance @xmath48 is given by @xmath52 where @xmath53 .",
    "equations  ( 3 ) for the pulse frequency derivatives can then be written @xmath54 where we have defined @xmath55 and a prime indicates a derivative with respect to @xmath56 .",
    "using equation ( 6 ) , we can rewrite equations ( 7)(9 ) as @xmath57 this is a nonlinear system of three equations with four unknowns- @xmath18 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 . assuming a value for one of them we can solve for the remaining parameters .",
    "we have chosen to use the eccentricity @xmath18 as our free parameter .",
    "for an assumed value of @xmath18 , we solve equations ( 11)(13 ) for @xmath56 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 using the newton - raphson method ( see e.g. , press 1992 ) .",
    "this method requires an initial guess for the unknown parameters , which is then successively improved until convergence to an actual solution is obtained .",
    "one must be careful to experiment with many different initial guesses , since nonlinear systems like this one often have multiple branches of solutions .",
    "in addition , symmetries must also be taken into account . here",
    "physically equivalent solutions are obtained if the direction of motion is reversed , and the signs of @xmath61 and @xmath56 are also reversed .",
    "this gives a different but equivalent orientation of the system .",
    "once @xmath56 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 are known , conservation of angular momentum together with equation  ( 6 ) gives @xmath62 using equations ( 14 ) and  ( 15 ) , we can calculate @xmath63 and @xmath64 , @xmath65 it is now straightforward to obtain @xmath2 ( from @xmath63 , assuming that the pulsar mass @xmath46 is known ) and the semi - major axis @xmath66 .",
    "when @xmath67 , we can directly obtain @xmath23 as follows . for small @xmath2 , @xmath68 .",
    "therefore @xmath69 and equation  ( 17 ) gives @xmath70 for larger values of @xmath22 , one needs to assume a value for @xmath24 and solve equation  ( 4 ) numerically for @xmath2 .",
    "when only three derivatives are known , one can assume values for two parameters and solve for the remaining three parameters in the same way as above .",
    "alternatively , in the special case of a circular orbit ( @xmath71 ) , the system can be solved completely ( to within @xmath24 ) using only three derivatives . in that case",
    ", we have @xmath72 note that here @xmath56 is the longitude of the pulsar _ measured from the ascending node _ ( _ not _ from pericenter as before ) .",
    "using equation  ( 19 ) to eliminate @xmath73 , we get @xmath74 this gives @xmath75.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using equation  ( 19 ) and conservation of angular momentum , we have @xmath76 dividing equation ( 26 ) by equation  ( 27 ) , and then using equations ( 24 ) , ( 25 ) and  ( 27 ) , we get @xmath77 where @xmath56 is given by equation ( 25 ) . for @xmath67 , @xmath68 . then , for given values of the frequency derivatives and the pulsar mass @xmath46 , @xmath2 can be calculated explicitly using equation  ( 29 ) .",
    "we find @xmath78 where @xmath56 is given by equation  ( 25 ) .",
    "finally we can calculate @xmath79 , where @xmath50 is given by equation  ( 28 ) .",
    "when only two derivatives are available , one can obtain a one - parameter family of solutions , assuming again that @xmath80 .",
    "we can use @xmath11 ( or equivalently @xmath60 , using eq .",
    "[ 24 ] ) as the free parameter and then use the equations of  2.3 to construct a one - parameter family of solutions explicitly .",
    "the millisecond pulsar psr  b1620@xmath1226 , in the globular cluster m4 , has a low - mass binary companion ( probably a white dwarf of mass @xmath81 for a pulsar mass @xmath82 ) in a @xmath83day low - eccentricity orbit ( lyne 1988 ; mckenna & lyne 1988 ) . the unusually large frequency second and third derivatives indicate the presence of a _ second companion _ around the inner binary , forming a hierarchical triple configuration ( backer 1992 ; backer , foster , & sallmen 1993 ; thorsett , arzoumanian , & taylor 1993 ) . such hierarchical triple systems",
    "are expected to be produced quite easily in dense globular clusters through dynamical interactions between binaries . in a typical interaction ,",
    "one star would be ejected , leaving the other three in a stable triple system ( rasio , mcmillan , & hut 1995 ; sigurdsson 1995 ) .",
    "previous calculations ( done using frequency derivatives up to the third order ) showed that the mass of the second companion could be anywhere from @xmath84 to @xmath85 ( michel 1994 ; sigurdsson 1995 ) .",
    "recently , a measurement has been made of the fourth derivative of the pulse frequency , along with preliminary measurements of secular changes of the inner binary parameters due to the perturbation of the second companion ( arzoumanian 1996 ) .",
    "these include a precession of the inner binary orbital plane ( measured as a change in the projected semi - major axis of the binary ) , and possible changes in the eccentricity and longitude of periastron .      in this section ,",
    "we apply the method described in  2.2 to analyze the properties of the second companion in the psr  b1620@xmath1226 triple system .",
    "since the orbital period of the second companion is much longer than that of the inner binary ( for all solutions obtained below ) , we treat the inner binary as a single object . keeping the same notation as before ,",
    "we let @xmath86 be the mass of the inner binary pulsar , with @xmath87 the mass of the neutron star and @xmath88 the mass of the ( inner ) companion , and we denote by @xmath2 the mass of the second companion ( to be determined ) . as in  2 the orbital parameters ( @xmath20 , @xmath19 , @xmath18 , @xmath17 and @xmath16 ) refer to the orbit of the ( second ) companion with respect to the center of mass of the system ( here the entire triple ) .",
    "however , a subscript 1 for the orbital elements refers to the orbit of the inner binary .",
    "the results presented in this section are all for @xmath89 ( assuming @xmath90 , @xmath91 ; cf .",
    "thorsett 1993 ) .",
    "however , we have have checked that they are not very sensitive to small changes in the value of @xmath46 .",
    "in particular the companion mass @xmath2 varies only as @xmath92 ( cf .",
    "[ 4 ] ) .",
    "we use the latest available values of the pulse frequency derivatives ( arzoumanian & thorsett 1996 ) for the epoch mjd 48725.0 : @xmath93 these values take into account a ( very precise ) keplerian model of the inner orbit .",
    "the corrections to @xmath9 due to proper motion are negligible for this pulsar .",
    "the frequency derivatives should therefore reflect the residual motion of the pulsar caused by the presence ( unmodeled ) of a second companion .",
    "however , as discussed in  2.1 , the observed first derivative @xmath29 can be a combination of the intrinsic spin - down of the pulsar and the acceleration due to the second companion .",
    "since @xmath29 is negative , and @xmath30 is always negative , @xmath94 can in principle be either positive or negative .",
    "if it is negative , then its magnitude must be @xmath95 .",
    "if it is positive , its magnitude can in principle be larger .",
    "however , it can not be much larger than @xmath96 since this would imply a very large intrinsic spin - down rate , and a short characteristic age @xmath97 , which is not expected for a millisecond pulsar ( cf .",
    "thorsett 1993 and  2.1 ) . in practice",
    ", we find that varying @xmath98 in the entire range @xmath99 to @xmath100 does not affect our solutions significantly ( see below ) .",
    "the expected value of @xmath10 due to timing noise can be estimated using , e.g. , figure  1 of arzoumanian ( 1994 ) , which gives the timing noise parameter @xmath101 as a function of period derivative .",
    "this gives an _ upper limit _ on the contribution to @xmath10 due to intrinsic timing noise of @xmath102 , which is an order of magnitude smaller than @xmath103 .",
    "the same conclusion is reached if we consider for comparison psr  b1855 + 09 , which has a comparable spin rate ( @xmath104 ) but a frequency second derivative @xmath105 i.e. , at least four orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath35 in psr  b1620 - 26 ( kaspi 1994 ) .",
    "figure  1 illustrates our `` standard solution '' , obtained under the assumption that @xmath106 and using the current best - fit value for the fourth derivative , @xmath107 . following the method of  2.2 , we use @xmath18 as the free parameter .",
    "we see that there are no solutions for @xmath108 .",
    "hence a nearly circular orbit is ruled out . for @xmath109",
    "there are two solutions for each value of the eccentricity , and hence two possible values of @xmath2 .    in the first branch of solutions , @xmath2 approaches zero as the eccentricity approaches the value @xmath110 .",
    "however for very small @xmath2 the second companion gets close enough to the inner binary to make the triple configuration dynamically unstable .",
    "the stability of the triple system can be checked using an approximate criterion of the form @xmath111 ( for stability ) , where @xmath112/[(a_p+a_c)(1+e_1)]$ ] is the ratio of the outer pericenter separation ( from the center of mass of the inner binary to the second companion ) to the apastron separation of the inner binary .",
    "here we have used the results of eggleton & kiseleva ( 1995 ) , who give @xmath113 here @xmath114 and @xmath115 are the inner and outer mass ratios . using the values @xmath116 , @xmath117 , and @xmath118 , we get @xmath119 .",
    "thus we require that @xmath120 for a dynamically stable solution .",
    "this gives us a lower limit on the second companion mass @xmath121 .",
    "in addition , we can rule out solutions with orbital periods @xmath122 since this would have been detected already in the timing residuals ( s.  e.  thorsett , personal communication ) .",
    "this gives us a somewhat stricter lower limit of @xmath123 .",
    "for the second branch of solutions , @xmath2 increases monotonically from @xmath124 to @xmath125 ( i.e. , jupiter to brown - dwarf masses ) as @xmath18 increases from @xmath126 to @xmath127 . as @xmath18 approaches 1.0 ,",
    "the mass @xmath2 remains bound .",
    "so even though the solutions with @xmath128 are a priori unlikely , they provide a strict upper limit @xmath129 .",
    "since all our solutions have @xmath67 , our method gives in fact the product @xmath23 ( cf .",
    " 2.2 ) , which we show in figure  1 .",
    "the effect of varying @xmath98 in the range 01.0 is shown in figure  2 .",
    "we see that smaller values of @xmath98 give slightly smaller mass solutions , but the overall mass range is not significantly affected . in particular , we see that stellar - mass solutions for @xmath2 are not allowed even if the observed value of @xmath9 is assumed to be mostly intrinsic .",
    "negative values of @xmath98 give similar results .",
    "we see that our standard solution excludes the stellar mass range ( @xmath130 ) for the second companion , and this is rather surprising .",
    "a stellar mass would provide a natural explanation for the anomalously high eccentricity of the inner binary ( @xmath131 ) in terms of secular perturbations ( rasio 1994 ) .",
    "in addition , a stellar mass would also be consistent with a preliminary identification of an optical counterpart for the system ( bailyn 1994 ) .",
    "we have seen already that assuming a different value for @xmath94 does not change our conclusions .",
    "alternatively , we can try to vary the value of @xmath45 within its fairly large error bar .",
    "however , we find that varying @xmath45 within its formal @xmath132 error bar still does not produce significant changes in @xmath2 . in order to obtain stellar - mass solutions",
    ", we find that we must vary @xmath45 within a larger @xmath133 error bar around the best fit value @xmath134 given above .",
    "note that this allows for a change of sign in the actual value of @xmath45 .",
    "the results are illustrated in figure  3 .",
    "here we assume that @xmath135 .",
    "we find that stellar - mass solutions ( with @xmath136 ) are possible only if @xmath137 , i.e. , @xmath45 must be more than @xmath138 away from its present best - fit value ( assuming @xmath139 )",
    ".      we can further constrain the system by considering secular perturbations in the orbital elements of the inner binary .",

    "we use these measurements to further constrain the system by requiring that all our solutions be consistent with these secular perturbations .    since the period @xmath142 of the second companion is much larger than the period of the inner binary",

    "note that proper motion can also lead to a change in the projected semi - major axis @xmath157 of the pulsar .",
    "however , if the observed @xmath156 were due to proper motion , arzoumanian ( 1996 ) find that the inner binary companion of the pulsar would then have a mass @xmath158 , with @xmath159 for a @xmath160 pulsar , which seems very unlikely .",
    "hence we assume here that the observed @xmath156 is caused by the secular precession of the inner orbit induced by the presence of the second companion .    to incorporate these measurements into our theoretical model , we have performed monte - carlo simulations with the unknown variables in the system , namely @xmath161 , @xmath16 , @xmath18 , @xmath144 , and @xmath145 .",

    "we then calculate the secular perturbation rates using equations ( 33)(36 ) , and we check for consistency with the observed values of the perturbations .",
    "we use a simple rejection algorithm , accepting or rejecting a trial configuration based on a three - dimensional gaussian probability distribution which is the product of gaussian distributions for @xmath167 , @xmath168 and @xmath156 centered around their mean values and with standard deviations equal to the error bars given above .    in figures  4 and  5",

    "fig .  6 ) .",
    "the eccentricity of the second companion , @xmath18 , is also poorly constrained .",
    "we can obtain a predicted value of the fifth pulse frequency derivative @xmath185 at the current epoch for each of our solutions by differentiating equation  ( 9 ) for a specified value of @xmath18 . in figure  7",
    ", we show the most probable values for @xmath185 from the monte - carlo simulations of  3.2 . for @xmath186 ( standard solution )",
    ", we find that the most probable value is @xmath187 , whereas for @xmath170 ( which gives stellar mass solutions ) , @xmath188 .",
    "thus even a crude measurement of @xmath189 should completely settle the question of the second companion s mass .",
    "we have also calculated the predicted evolution of the frequency derivatives @xmath9 through @xmath45 for the next 20 years .",
    "we show the results for the typical orbit of a jupiter - to - brown - dwarf - size companion ( @xmath190 ) in figure  8 , and for a stellar - mass companion ( @xmath191 ) in figure  9 . in the first case ,",
    "the orbit has @xmath192 , a period @xmath193 and @xmath194 .",
    "we see that @xmath9 changes sign in about 10 years , and that @xmath11 decreases surprisingly fast , changing sign in about 1.5 years . for the stellar - mass case , only @xmath9 changes sign in 10 years .",
    "the other frequency derivatives do not change significantly over 20 years .",
    "the orbit in this case has @xmath195 , a period @xmath196 and @xmath197 .",
    "thus a change in sign of @xmath11 within the next couple of years would provide additional support for the existence of a planet or brown dwarf in this system .",
    "we also find that , in all cases , the values of @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath45 at _ apastron _ are at least two , three , and five orders of magnitude smaller , respectively , than their present observed values .",
    "this means that the triple nature of the system would probably remain undetectable near apastron .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to find the second companion relatively close to periastron in our solutions ( within @xmath198 for the case illustrated in fig .  8 , and @xmath199 for the case considered in fig .",
    "as mentioned previously , the method for determining the orbital parameters of a binary pulsar presented in  2 , although quite general in its formulation , can only be applied successfully to systems containing fast millisecond pulsars in which the dynamically - induced frequency derivatives dominate the measurements . parts .",
    "in addition , it requires several successive higher - order frequency derivatives to be measured accurately .",
    "the psr  b1620@xmath1226 triple system satisfies all of these conditions , and hence is ideally suited for analysis using our method .",
    "psr  b1620@xmath1226 has been observed for more than seven years , and its hierarchical triple structure is strongly supported by all current observations ( backer , foster , & sallmen 1993 ; thorsett , arzoumanian , & taylor 1993 ; arzoumanian & thorsett 1996 ) .",
    "the error bar on @xmath45 is likely to shrink rapidly as more timing data become available .",
    "if the actual value of @xmath45 is close to the current best - fit value @xmath200 , then the second companion must have a mass @xmath201 as long as the system has an inclination @xmath202 , with the most probable mass ( given by our monte - carlo simulations ) being @xmath4 ( the error - bar indicates an 80% confidence interval ) .",
    "if @xmath45 is within @xmath132 of @xmath134 , then the same result holds to within a factor of two . a rather low inclination angle ( @xmath203 ) or @xmath204 ( i.e. , @xmath45 more than @xmath138 away from @xmath134 )",
    "would be required if the second companion is a main - sequence star with @xmath205 .",
    "instead our results clearly suggest that the second companion is a @xmath206 brown dwarf or giant planet .",
    "this is surprising since low - mass objects are not expected to be found in the cores of globular clusters .",
    "the reason is that low - mass objects have higher velocities in energy equipartition and are preferentially ejected from globular clusters as they evaporate in the tidal field of the galaxy .",
    "hence we do not expect to find very low - mass stars or brown dwarfs in globular clusters , especially not near the core .",
    "recent hst observations of globular clusters ( e.g. , paresce , de marchi , & romaniello 1995 ) also support this view by finding that stellar mass functions in clusters flatten or even drop for masses below @xmath207 .",
    "in addition , if the second companion of psr  b1620@xmath1226 is indeed of low mass , then the unusually high eccentricity of the inner binary pulsar can not be explained by secular perturbations due to the second companion , since that would require a stellar - mass second companion ( rasio 1994 ) .",
    "it would also preclude any possibility of an optical identification of the triple system .",
    "bailyn ( 1994 ) have searched deep optical images of m4 for an optical counterpart of the pulsar .",
    "they have identified a candidate which , if interpreted as a single object , could be a @xmath208 main - sequence star within @xmath209 of the nominal pulsar position . however , it is possible that this object is in fact a blend of fainter stars not associated with the pulsar , or simply a chance superposition .",
    "future observations of the region with hst , as well as improved ground - based astrometry , should help resolve the issue .",
    "low - mass stars and brown dwarfs could exist in dense globular cluster cores as binary companions to more massive stars .",
    "dynamical interactions could then lead to an exchange , leaving the low - mass object in orbit around a neutron star . indeed , sigurdsson ( 1992 )",
    "had discussed the possibility of finding planetary companions to pulsars in globular clusters even before the triple nature of psr  b1620@xmath1226 was established .",
    "a possible formation scenario for the triple system starts with an interaction between a neutron - star - white - dwarf binary and a main - sequence star with a large jupiter - type planet or brown - dwarf companion ( cf .",
    "sigurdsson 1995 , 1993 ) . as a result of this interaction the white dwarf",
    "is ejected while the main - sequence star and its planet or brown - dwarf companion remain in orbit around the neutron star . the main - sequence star ,",
    "as it evolves and later expands as a red giant , would then transfer mass onto the neutron star , thus spinning it up and forming the millisecond pulsar in the triple configuration we see today .",
    "however , tidal dissipation during the mass transfer phase would effectively circularize the orbit of the binary , leaving a residual eccentricity @xmath210 ( phinney 1992 ) .",
    "therefore this formation scenario leaves the much higher observed eccentricity ( @xmath131 ) of the inner binary unexplained .",
    "it has been suggested that the eccentricity of the inner binary may have been induced during a dynamical interaction with another cluster star .",
    "the probability of disrupting the triple during such an interaction is only @xmath211 ( sigurdsson 1995 ) .",
    "based on the results of rasio & heggie ( 1995 ) , however , we find that the observed eccentricity would require an encounter with a distance of closest approach of @xmath212 , considerably smaller than the size of the outer orbit , and occuring on average once in @xmath213 . for comparison ,",
    "the lifetime of the triple system in the cluster is only about @xmath214 , where @xmath215 is the density near the center of m4 , @xmath216 is the velocity dispersion , and @xmath17 is the size of the outer orbit ( rasio 1994 ) . for one interaction that could have produced the eccentricity of the inner binary ,",
    "we therefore expect @xmath217 interactions that could have disrupted the triple , each with probability @xmath211 , leaving the probability of survival at @xmath218 .",
    "an additional problem is that the age of the millisecond pulsar in this scenario must be comparable to the age of the triple ( @xmath219 ) , which requires the millisecond pulsar to be extremely young .",
    "this problem could be avoided if the triple was instead formed during an interaction involving a _ pre - existing _ binary millisecond pulsar and another primordial binary ( containing the present second companion and another star that was ejected during the interaction ; see rasio , mcmillan , & hut 1995 ) .",
    "the current eccentricity of the ( inner ) binary pulsar could then have been induced during the same interaction that formed the triple , although this would require some fine tuning .",
    "more significantly , one would expect the more massive member of the other binary rather than the low - mass object ( jupiter or brown dwarf ) to be preferentially retained in the triple while the other gets ejected .",
    "naturally , if the low - mass object ( jupiter or brown dwarf ) was attached to a much more massive star , it is easier to understand how it was retained by the cluster and why it is now found close to the cluster core . in particular , in the first formation scenario discussed above , the main - sequence star must have been fairly massive ( @xmath220 ) to have evolved into a red giant after the triple was formed .",
    "two - body relaxation in the cluster will tend to bring this main - sequence star ( with its attached low - mass companion ) down to the cluster core since it is more massive than the average object in the cluster .",
    "confirmation of the existence of a @xmath206 object in psr  b1620@xmath1226 would therefore provide further indication that many stars , even in globular clusters , could have very low - mass companions or planets .",
    "this is especially important in the light of recent discoveries of several @xmath221 objects around nearby stars ( e.g. , mayor & queloz 1995 ; butler & marcy 1996 ; marcy & butler 1996 ) .",
    "we now turn to the application of our method to the planetary system around the millisecond pulsar psr  b1257@xmath612 .",
    "this system contains three confirmed earth - mass planets in quasi - circular orbits ( wolszczan & frail 1992 ; wolszczan 1994 ) .",
    "the planets have masses of @xmath222 , @xmath223 , and @xmath224 , where @xmath161 , @xmath16 and @xmath225 are the inclinations of the orbits with respect to the line of sight , and are at distances of 0.19au , 0.36au , and 0.47au , respectively , from the pulsar .",
    "in addition , the unusually large second and third frequency derivatives of the pulsar suggest the existence of a fourth , more distant and massive planet in the system ( wolszczan 1996 ) .",
    "the residual pulse frequency derivatives for psr  b1257@xmath612 ( after subtraction of a model for the inner three planets ) are @xmath226 , @xmath227 , and @xmath228 ( wolszczan 1996 ) , while the frequency @xmath229 .",
    "the value of @xmath9 has been corrected for the apparent acceleration due to the pulsar s transverse velocity ( the so - called shlovskii effect ; cf .",
    "camilo 1994 ) .",
    "the error bars on @xmath31 and @xmath9 , for the purposes of this discussion , are negligible .",
    "note that the measurement of @xmath11 is only preliminary , but we assume here that the value quoted above ( from wolszczan 1996 ) is correct . comparison with psr  b1855@xmath609 , which has a very similar pulse frequency , @xmath230 , and first frequency derivative @xmath231 ( kaspi 1994 ) indicates that the observed @xmath9 for psr  b1257@xmath612 could well be entirely ( or in large part ) intrinsic rather than acceleration - induced .",
    "the timing age for the pulsar , @xmath232 , is entirely consistent with that expected for a millisecond pulsar .",
    "therefore we will treat @xmath94 essentially as a free parameter in our analysis .",
    "the observed @xmath10 , on the other hand , is two orders of magnitude larger than for psr  b1855@xmath609 , which has @xmath233 .",
    "thus the observed @xmath10 is almost certainly due to the presence of another planet rather than intrinsic timing noise in the pulsar .    with three frequency derivatives measured , we can use the method of  2.3 to model the system . given the near - circular orbits of the three inner planets ,",
    "it is natural to assume that the orbit of the fourth planet also has a low eccentricity .",
    "in addition , it is easy to show that dynamical interactions with passing stars in the galaxy are not likely to produce any significant perturbations of the system ( which could otherwise increase the eccentricity of an outer planet s orbit ; cf .",
    "heggie & rasio 1996 ) .",
    "since the value of @xmath94 is uncertain , we explore a wide range , @xmath234 .",
    "note that , for a circular orbit , @xmath94 and @xmath11 must have opposite signs ( cf .",
    "[ 19 ] and [ 21 ] ) .",
    "hence @xmath94 can not be positive .",
    "for each value of @xmath94 , we calculate the mass and semi - major axis of the fourth planet using equations  ( 25 ) , ( 28 ) and  ( 30 ) .",
    "we illustrate the results in figure  10 .",
    "we find that the mass of the fourth planet varies significantly , from @xmath235 ( for @xmath236 ) to @xmath237 ( for @xmath106 ) .",
    "the simplest interpretation of the present best - fit values of the frequency derivatives , assuming @xmath106 , implies a mass of about @xmath238 ( i.e. , comparable to saturn s mass ) for the fourth planet , at a distance of about @xmath239 ( i.e. , comparable to pluto s distance from the sun ) , and with a period of about @xmath240 in a circular , coplanar orbit ( wolszczan 1996 ) .",
    "however , if @xmath241 , then the fourth planet can have a wide range of masses .",
    "in particular , it can have a mass comparable to that of mars ( at a distance of 9 au ) , uranus ( at a distance of 25 au ) or neptune ( at a distance of 26 au ) , for @xmath242 , 0.30 , or @xmath243 respectively .      in this system the perturbations of the inner planets produced by the fourth planet are probably far too small to be detected .",
    "this is in contrast to the mutual perturbations of the inner planets themselves , which are important and have been detected ( rasio et al .",
    "1992 ; wolszczan 1994 ) .",
    "using equations ( 33)(36 ) , we predict @xmath244 and @xmath245 for the orbit of the third planet , assuming that all orbits are coplanar and that the mass of the fourth planet is @xmath246 .",
    "the perturbations for the two innermost planets are even smaller .",
    "hence the existence of the fourth planet is likely to be confirmed only through further measurements of pulse frequency derivatives .",
    "it has been pointed out that the masses and radii of the three inner planets in psr  b1257@xmath612 are in the same ratios as the masses and radii of the corresponding first three planets in the solar system ( mazeh & goldman 1995 ) .",
    "this might perhaps be indicative of a global underlying formation mechanism for the two systems .",
    "although the fourth planet could have the same mass ( normalized to the mass of the third planet ) as that of mars , uranus , or neptune ( normalized to the mass of the earth ) , the ratio of radii in each case would be much larger than the corresponding ratio for the solar system ( cf .",
    "thus this system does not seem to maintain its regularity with the solar system , since the mass and radius ratios of the fourth planet would not simultaneously match those of any planet in the solar system .",
    "this is true for the entire range of values of @xmath94 considered above .",
    "we are very grateful to z.  arzoumanian , s.  e.  thorsett and a.  wolszczan for many useful discussions and for communicating results of observations in progress .",
    "we also thank c.  bailyn and s.  sigurdsson for helpful comments .",

    "the orbit of the inner binary and the orbit of the second companion in general do not lie in the same plane .",
    "the inclinations of the two planes with respect to the line of sight are given by @xmath161 and @xmath16 .",
    "to specify the plane of an orbit completely , one needs the inclination angle together with another azimuthal angle @xmath162 ( which lies between 0 and @xmath247 ) .",
    "since the reference axis for @xmath162 is arbitrary , we can take it to lie in the plane of one of the orbits , so that @xmath162 is the difference between the azimuthal angles of the two planes . in random monte - carlo trials , @xmath162 is then taken to be uniformly distributed between @xmath248 and @xmath247 .    in order to determine @xmath144 and @xmath145 using the other angles , we need to change coordinates between two reference frames .",
    "the first frame has its origin at the center of mass of the inner binary , with the x - axis in the plane of the orbit of the second companion , the y - axis passing through the pericenter of the orbit , and the z - axis perpendicular to the plane of the orbit , so that the motion of second companion is counterclockwise around the z - axis .",
    "we shall refer to the coordinates of the second companion in this frame as ( @xmath249 , @xmath250 , @xmath251 ) .",
    "then , @xmath252 , @xmath253 , and @xmath254 .",
    "the second frame similarly has its origin at the center of mass of the inner binary , with the x - axis in the plane of the orbit of the inner binary , the y - axis passing through the pericenter of the orbit , and the z - axis perpendicular to the plane of the orbit , so that the motion of pulsar is counterclockwise around the z - axis .",
    "we wish to find the coordinates ( @xmath255 , @xmath256 , @xmath257 ) of the second companion in this frame .",
    "we can then calculate @xmath144 and @xmath145 using the formulae @xmath258 and @xmath259 , keeping in mind that for @xmath260 , we must add @xmath261 to @xmath145 in order to get the correct quadrant .    in order to get ( @xmath255 , @xmath256 , @xmath257 ) from ( @xmath249 , @xmath250 , @xmath251 ) , we shall rotate the first frame to the second frame using the standard euler angles formalism ( see , e.g. , goldstein 1980 ) . in this formalism , any arbitrary rotation of an object is represented as a sequence of three consecutive rotations- first about the z - axis by an angle @xmath262 , then about the new x - axis by an angle @xmath263 , and finally again about the new z - axis by an angle @xmath264 .    in order to use this formalism , we will use an intermediate frame of reference that is fixed in space , with its origin at the center of mass of the inner binary , the y - axis along the line of sight , the x - axis in the plane of the orbit of the second companion , and the z - axis such that the motion of the second companion is counterclockwise about the z - axis .",
