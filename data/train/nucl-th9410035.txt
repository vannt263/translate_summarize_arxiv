    "the structure properties of hypernuclei reflect the nature of the underlying baryon - baryon interactions , for which there is very little two - body data other than for the nucleon - nucleon interaction , and thus can provide rather stringent tests of models for the free - space @xmath6 and @xmath7 interactions . over the years",
    ", the nijmegen group has constructed a number of one - boson - exchange models for the baryon - baryon interaction ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 ) using su(3)@xmath11 symmetry to relate baryon - baryon - meson coupling constants and phenomenological hard or soft cores at short distances .",
    "more recently , the jlich group has constructed meson - exchange models for the @xmath6 interaction along the lines of the bonn model for the @xmath8 interaction using su(6 ) symmetry to relate coupling constants and short - range form factors ( reviews of all the relevant models appear in the proceedings of the shimoda conference on hypernuclear and strange particle physics @xcite ; in particular , see the reviews by rijken and holinde ) .    to test these models against the considerable body of information on @xmath0 hypernuclei @xcite , effective interactions appropriate for use in limited spaces of shell - model orbits must be calculated .",
    "this has been done by calculating nuclear - matter g - matrices @xcite for the coupled @xmath12 and @xmath13 channels . for most models , the resulting @xmath0",
    "well depth is in reasonable agreement with the empirical value deduced from fitting the binding energies of @xmath0 single - particle states @xcite observed via the @xmath14,k@xmath15 reaction @xcite , but the partial - wave contributions vary widely for the different models .",
    "in fact , the spin - dependence of the central interaction varies considerably in the different models @xcite .",
    "while empirical @xmath12 effective interactions fitted to the properties of light @xmath0 hypernuclei are more attractive in the singlet than the triplet state @xcite , a conclusive choice between the models can not be made since the effective @xmath16 interaction resulting from @xmath17 coupling , which contributes strongly to the spin - dependence for a=4 @xcite , has yet to be evaluated in a consistent way .",
    "the baryon - baryon interactions which result from an extension of the boson - exchange models to the @xmath18 sector can be qualitatively quite different from one another at long range @xcite , even before the uncertainties at short range , where quark model calculations may provide some guidance ( k. shimizu in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , are considered .",
    "rather little is known about @xmath18 systems .",
    "there are only a a few examples of @xmath19 hypernuclear events seen in emulsion experiments with @xmath20 beams , and a few others attributed to the formation of @xmath1 hypernuclei ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for references ) .",
    "the binding energies of the three examples of light @xmath19 hypernuclei indicate that the effective @xmath19 interaction is quite strongly attractive , with a relative @xmath21 matrix element of magnitude @xmath22 mev .",
    "also , when taken at face value , the @xmath1 hypernuclear events indicate an attractive @xmath1-nucleus potential with a strength roughly comparable to that for @xmath0 hypernuclei @xcite .",
    "when the short - range behavior of the @xmath7 interaction is chosen to be similar to that of the @xmath8 interaction , only model d of the nijmegen interactions can provide sufficient attraction to account for the empirical @xmath19 matrix element @xcite .",
    "model d also gives an attractive @xmath1-nucleus potential @xcite .",
    "in contrast , model f gives repulsion in both cases .",
    "improved data for the @xmath18 sector would put strong constraints on baryon - baryon interaction models . to this end",

    "a more intense separated 12 gev / c @xmath20",
    "beam @xcite is now available for @xmath3 studies .",
    "the first use of this beam line has been in a search for the @xmath23 dibaryon but new proposals are focussed on more general studies of @xmath24 spectroscopy .",
    "several of these concentrate on the detection of @xmath19 hypernuclei produced by @xmath25 interactions with nuclei .",
    "another attractive possibility would be to look for @xmath1 hypernuclear states using the @xmath3 reaction in analogy to studies of @xmath0 hypernuclei using the @xmath26 reaction .",
    "unfortunately , the @xmath3 cross sections leading to single - particle @xmath1 configurations are small , of the order of a few hundred nb / sr for light systems @xcite , and somewhat below current detection capabilities .",
    "nevertheless , an important question , should this type of experiment become feasible , concerns the width of @xmath1 hypernuclear states which arises from the mixing of @xmath1 and @xmath19 hypernuclear states and depends directly on the strength of the @xmath27 interaction .",
    "there have been two recent estimates of these widths @xcite using rather different approaches .",
    "our own estimates @xcite of the decay ( escape ) widths arising from strong @xmath28 , @xmath29 or @xmath0 emission from @xmath1-nucleus configurations were made using standard shell - model techniques . for pedagogical reasons related to the simplicity of nuclear parentages , we concentrated on calculations for a @xmath30n target . in this paper",
    ", we make estimates for the escape widths of bound @xmath25 hypernuclear states likely to be produced in the more practical @xmath31c@xmath32be reaction considered by ikeda _",
    "_ @xcite . while the two calculations give comparable estimates of the widths for @xmath27 interactions of the same strength , the partial decay widths from different sources are quite different .",
    "consequently , we point out some of the reasons for these differences .",
    "the early emulsion data which suggested the existence of bound @xmath1 states in various nuclear systems were analyzed by dover and gal @xcite in terms of a @xmath1-nucleus single - particle woods - saxon well with a depth @xmath33 mev , radius parameter @xmath34 fm and diffuseness @xmath35 fm ( or a depth of 21 mev for @xmath36 fm ) .",
    "this value of @xmath37 , comparable to that for the @xmath0-nucleus potential @xcite , binds a @xmath25 in both @xmath21 and @xmath38 states to a @xmath39b core with binding energies of 10.7 and 1.5 mev , respectively @xcite . since stable targets",
    "have @xmath40 , the @xmath1 states of interest will be essentially pure @xmath25 charge states ( with @xmath41 ) .    the spectrum for the @xmath31c@xmath32be reaction should be qualitatively very similar ( see fig .  1 of ref",
    "@xcite ) to that for the well - studied @xmath31c@xmath42c reaction @xcite . the cross sections will , however , be considerably smaller on account of the smaller elementary cross section and the somewhat higher momentum transfer ( around 420 mev / c to 500 mev / c over the angular range @xmath43 compared with @xmath44 mev / c over the same range , respectively ) .",
    "the distorted - wave impulse approximation calculations for @xmath45 gev / c by ikeda _",
    "@xcite for the natural parity @xmath46 configurations give @xmath47 cross sections of 0.25 @xmath48b / sr for the @xmath49 ground - state peak and 0.50 @xmath48b / sr for the @xmath50 complex of @xmath51 states , if the recent kek measurement of the elementary cross section ( averaged over @xmath52 from @xmath53 to @xmath54 ) by iijima _ et al . _ @xcite is used .",
    "these cross sections at @xmath55 gev should be multiplied by @xmath56 , representing the parentage for proton pickup from @xmath31c to the ground state of @xmath39b . however",
    ", this factor is gained back at @xmath57 gev / c where the elementary cross section appears to peak ( see fig .  5 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) and for which the d6 beamline at brookhaven is optimized @xcite .",
    "the relevant basis for comparison for these predicted cross sections is the sensitivity of @xmath58 @xmath48b / sr achieved for the @xmath26 reaction with a flux of @xmath59 @xmath60 on target per spill and an energy resolution of @xmath61 mev @xcite . for @xmath20 at 1.8 gev , a flux of @xmath62 per @xmath63 protons with a @xmath64 of 2.5:1 was typical in 1992 ( note added in proof to ref .",
    "@xcite ) ; the flux is limited by the proton flux that the production target can stand but runs have been made using @xmath65 protons per spill .",
    "the question of how much improved resolution can improve the sensitivity depends on the natural width of the @xmath1 hypernuclear states , each of which is broadened by the strong decay processes @xmath66 in fact ,",
    "the first concern is that @xmath1 hypernuclear states could have widths that are some appreciable fraction of the nuclear matter estimate ( @xmath67 mev @xcite ) and therefore comparable with the spacings between @xmath1 single - particle levels .",
    "our recent estimates @xcite and those of ikeda _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , both of which use @xmath68 conversion potentials based on the nijmegen model d interaction , give much smaller widths of around 1.5 mev . since the calculated widths depend quadratically on the strength of the conversion potential , which involves the exchange of strange mesons and varies widely in different baryon - baryon models , the widths could differ considerably from these estimates .",
    "of course , both the positions and widths of @xmath1 hypernuclear levels , if they exist and can be observed with sufficiently high resolution , together with apparently strong attraction in the @xmath19 interaction , would put very strong constraints on baryon - baryon interaction models .    in the next section , we present in some detail our calculation of the widths of @xmath1 hypernuclear states based on the mixing of @xmath1 and @xmath19 hypernuclear states through the @xmath68 interaction .",
    "we concentrate on the case of states in @xmath69be since @xmath31c is the most likely target for attempts to observe bound @xmath1 hypernuclear states using the @xmath3 reaction .",
    "we also compare our calculation with that of ikeda _ et al .",
    "it is the admixtures of @xmath19 hypernuclear states into a @xmath1 hypernuclear state which give the state its decay width into single @xmath0 , nucleon and other channels .",
    "the advantage of a microscopic shell - model treatment is that the decay energies are defined in terms of the energies of the nuclear cores and the interaction of the two @xmath0 s with these cores and each other .",
    "the decay energies are then quite well determined in terms of our empirical knowledge of single and double @xmath0 hypernuclei . in practice",
    ", we make a weak - coupling approximation in which we couple the hyperons to specific nuclear core states and do not consider the mixing of these states in a shell - model diagonalization ; there are , however , constraints imposed the fact that there should be no spurious center of mass motion , which we take into account as necessary . in this basis , an estimate of the mixing matrix elements in terms of the two - body matrix elements of the @xmath71 transition potential is straightforward .",
    "the actual admixures are calculated in first - order perturbation theory and the spectroscopic amplitudes for each decay channel are then calculated by standard parentage and recoupling techniques .      the energies of the most important @xmath25 and @xmath19 weak - coupling basis states and the relevant decay channels are given in fig . 1 for the specific case of a @xmath31c target , with the energies measured with respect to the @xmath72be ground state which is bound with respect to the @xmath73 threshold by b@xmath74 where @xmath75 the single-@xmath0 binding energies are known quite accurately for many @xmath29-shell hypernuclei @xcite and can be quite reliably estimated in cases for which a measurement does not exist .",
    "for example , in the present case , one obtains b@xmath76be ) = 10.46 mev by adding the 0.22 mev charge - dependent difference between b@xmath77be ) and b@xmath77b ) to b@xmath76b ) . alternatively , charge - independent estimates using empirically determined @xmath0-nucleus potentials @xcite would be quite accurate enough for the present purposes .",
    "@xmath78 is the interaction energy of a pair of @xmath0 particles in the @xmath79 state and is around 4.5 mev for the three known examples of @xmath80 hypernuclei @xcite .",
    "the @xmath81 threshold is a further 28.34 - s@xmath82 mev above the @xmath83 threshold .",
    "as noted in the previous section , the binding energy of the @xmath21 ( @xmath38 ) @xmath25 state is about 10.7 ( 1.5 ) mev for the @xmath25-nucleus potential of dover and gal @xcite , which has a woods - saxon form with a well depth of 24 mev for @xmath34 fm and @xmath84 fm . in the weak - coupling limit",
    ", the @xmath3 reaction will populate the @xmath25 states in proportion to the proton pickup spectroscopic factor relating the target and core states @xcite . for no spin - flip ,",
    "the @xmath21 states will have spin - parity @xmath49 and two @xmath38 @xmath85 states will be most strongly produced , with equal cross sections in the weak - coupling limit . in practice , the @xmath85 states will be mixed and separated by about an mev @xcite , depending on the @xmath86 interaction strength and the @xmath1 spin - orbit splitting @xcite , which is of the same order as the expected widths of the states .    the @xmath80 admixtures into the @xmath1 state , by conversion on a @xmath21- or @xmath38-shell proton , give rise to decay amplitudes into the single - baryon escape channels shown at the left of fig .",
    "the lowest threshold is for neutron emission , as will generally be the case since the transformation of two protons from the @xmath29-shell target nucleus leaves a neutron - rich a-2 core for the @xmath80 hypernucleus . for reference",
    ", the separation energies with respect to the @xmath70 hypernuclear ground state are ( assuming a constant @xmath78 for all species ) @xmath87 and so on .",
    "also important for neutron emission is the channel in which @xmath88be is left with one of the @xmath0s in a @xmath21 state and the other in a @xmath38 state .",
    "the separation between the @xmath21 and @xmath38 @xmath0 single - particle states is very close to 10 mev , a value that we take for definiteness .",
    "of course , the nuclear core may be left in an excited state and this energy is easily taken into account in the weak - coupling approximation .",
    "the @xmath19 states which are most important for @xmath89 conversion from the @xmath21 @xmath25 hypernuclear ground state are shown at the right in fig .  1 .",
    "in the case of @xmath90 @xmath89 conversion , the @xmath38 proton parentage of the @xmath39b ground state is spread over four @xmath91be levels , namely the @xmath92 ground state and the first three @xmath29-shell @xmath85 levels ( identified with the 3.37 and 5.96 mev levels and a level around 10 mev excitation energy ; the 7.54 mev level and possibly the 9.4 mev level are predominantly @xmath93 in nature ) .",
    "also , to a first approximation , we need to take into account conversion only in spin - singlet states since this forces the interaction to take place in a relative @xmath21 state for the interacting baryons ( the relative @xmath29 state interaction associated with spin - triplet states will be much weaker ) .",
    "thus , @xmath94b@xmath95 is the same for the @xmath96 and @xmath97 singlet configurations and the @xmath91be@xmath98 has an excitation energy of 10 mev , determined by the @xmath99 single - particle energy difference .",
    "the energy denominators , @xmath100 in fig .  1 , for a perturbative estimate of the admixtures then range from @xmath101 to @xmath102 mev .",
    "the @xmath89 conversion on a @xmath21-shell proton is not so clearcut to describe and make simple estimates for since the @xmath21 nucleon - hole strength occurs at a rather high excitation energy in the core nucleus .",
    "the @xmath21 proton - hole strength appears as a broad distribution of strength , with a width of 10 mev or more , in @xmath103 and @xmath104 reactions @xcite .",
    "the corresponding @xmath21 neutron strength is seen in the production of @xmath0 hypernuclei at low momentum transfer in the @xmath105 reaction @xcite .",
    "the spreading of the @xmath21 hole strength is apparent even in @xmath106 shell - model calculations for @xmath29-shell nuclei @xcite .",
    "the basis for these calculations consists of @xmath107 and @xmath108 configurations ( with @xmath109 for @xmath39b ) which are necessarily admixed to ensure that the center of mass is in a @xmath21 oscillator state .",
    "the @xmath110 strength then gets spread in the @xmath106 shell - model diagonalization , with the major fragments typically spread over 10 mev or more in excitation energy @xcite .",
    "each fragment acquires substantial nucleon escape widths through the @xmath108 components in the wave function .",
    "the centroid of the observed strength is quite well described in these calculations and the @xmath21 proton separation energy in @xmath29-shell nuclei can be adequately parametrized by the relation ( in mev ) s@xmath111 , where @xmath112 is the number of @xmath29-shell nucleons , giving s@xmath113 mev for @xmath39b .",
    "the corresponding excitation energy in the @xmath91be core nucleus for the @xmath70 hypernuclear states is s@xmath114 mev .",
    "then , the energy separation @xmath115 ( see fig .  1 ) between the @xmath116be @xmath21 state and the centroid of the @xmath117 configurations based on the @xmath21 proton hole strength in @xmath39b is given ( in mev ) by @xmath118 leading to a rough estimate for @xmath115 of 10 mev for a=12 .",
    "our width estimates are obtained by concentrating the @xmath21 hole strength at its centroid energy and making a perturbative calculation of the admixture of the @xmath19 state based on this pure @xmath21-hole state .      the wave function of a strangeness -2 hypernuclear state containing the lowest - energy @xmath1 configuration with admixtures of the configurations considered above will be of the form ( the basis is formed from @xmath106 excitation energy configurations with respect to the lowest @xmath70 configurations ) @xmath119 the coefficient @xmath120 provides immediate access to @xmath121-wave and @xmath122-wave neutron emission channels . in our weak - coupling approximation to the full shell - model calculation",

    "these widths should be increased slightly to take into account the effect of unbound @xmath0 orbits that we do not consider in our essentially bound - state approach .",

    "if the @xmath1 state comes close in energy to @xmath19 states based on major fragments of the @xmath21-hole strength , it could be fragmented by configuration mixing and thus acquire a spreading width .",

    "however , the separation of about 10 mev between the @xmath1 states of interest for a=12 and the centroid of @xmath19 states based on nuclear @xmath21-hole states suggests that the @xmath1 states will not be appreciably fragmented by this mechanism . for somewhat heavier systems",

    "for example , we estimate that the 10 mev separation for a=12 is reduced to about 3 mev for a=16 .",
    "a caveat to the results obtained in this paper is that the decay widths of @xmath1 hypernuclear states depend quadratically on the strength of the effective @xmath286 interaction in the medium , about which there is , at present , considerable uncertainty .",
