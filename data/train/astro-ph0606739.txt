    "nearly every elliptical galaxy and spiral bulge has a black hole at its center @xcite .",
    "the masses of the black holes , @xmath16 are related to the @xmath17-band luminosity , @xmath18 and average stellar velocity dispersion , @xmath2 of their host galaxies @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1 relationships are powerful tools as they allow the prediction of black hole masses  which are difficult to measure directly  from readily available galaxy parameters .",
    "the black hole population in the most massive galaxies has yet to be assayed , however , which means that estimates of @xmath3 in these objects are based on extrapolations of relationships defined by smaller galaxies .",
    "the current record for largest black hole mass measured directly is @xmath19 in m87 @xcite , yet m87 is only the _ second_-ranked galaxy in a cluster of modest richness .",
    "brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) in nearby abell clusters are typically @xmath20 more luminous @xcite and may host proportionately more massive bhs .",
    "testing this hypothesis through measurements of stellar dynamics requires both high sensitivity and high spatial - resolution , given the low central surface brightnesses and relatively large distances of bcgs .",
    "such observations were not possible with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) even before the failure of the _ space telescope imaging spectrograph ; _ they are only now becoming feasible with the advent of adaptive optics spectroscopy on 10 m class telescopes .",
    "a number of arguments suggest that black holes with @xmath14 do exist , even if this conclusion is not universal ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite argues that some qsos have @xmath21 based on an empirical relationship between @xmath16 broad - line width and nuclear luminosity for agn . @xcite and",
    "@xcite also argue that some qsos have black holes approaching this mass .",
    "of particular relevance for bcgs is the hypothesis that cluster cooling flows are inhibited by agn heating from the central galaxy @xcite .",
    "recent _ chandra _ observations support a picture in which episodic agn outbursts in bcgs heat the intra - cluster medium @xcite ; the energetics required to terminate cooling flows imply @xmath21 for many clusters @xcite .",
    "arguments for such massive black holes appear to be in conflict , however , with the expectations from the @xmath0 relationship applied to the local galaxy velocity - dispersion distribution function .",
    "@xcite find @xmath22 for @xmath23 ( which we will use throughout this paper ) .",
    "the @xcite local velocity dispersion function shows a strong cut - off at @xmath24 which implies that galaxies harboring black holes with @xmath14 would be extremely rare . @xcite",
    "have identified a handful of galaxies with @xmath25 but their results do not alter this conclusion .",
    "extrapolation of the @xmath0 relationship to galaxies more massive than m87 assumes that @xmath9 ( and not galaxy mass ) is the fundamental parameter for determining @xmath7 the uncertainty in such an extrapolation is underscored by @xcite , who argues that the @xmath0 relationship is curved rather than linear in log - log space , in the sense that , at the high-@xmath9 end , the `` log - quadratic '' relationship predicts higher @xmath3 than does equation ( [ eqn : msig ] ) .",
    "the wyithe @xmath0 relationship , implies that the space density of black holes with @xmath26 may be substantially higher than that implied by equation ( [ eqn : msig ] ) ( although the exact difference is highly sensitive to both the details of the velocity dispersion distribution function , and the assumed level of cosmic scatter in the @xmath0 relationship ) .    in this paper",
    "we point out that the @xmath1 relationship applied to the most luminous galaxies predicts @xmath3 values that are significantly larger than those predicted by either the @xcite or @xcite @xmath0 relationships .",
    "this difference arises because bcgs do not follow the @xcite relationship between @xmath8 and @xmath27 the relationship between @xmath8 and @xmath9 `` plateaus '' at large @xmath8 in the sense that bcgs have relatively low @xmath9 for their high @xmath8 ( @xcite ; see also @xcite , who have seen this effect in simulations . )",
    "resolution of which of the @xmath1 or @xmath0 relationships is most representative of the black hole population in the most massive galaxies will only be possible when black hole masses can be measured in such galaxies . in advance of such work , however , we can advance a number of arguments that suggest that the @xmath1 is a plausible and perhaps even preferred description for such systems .",
    "the first set of arguments are based on the central structure of bcgs and other luminous elliptical galaxies that have cores in their central brightness profiles @xcite . a core is evident as a radius at which the steep envelope of the galaxy `` breaks '' and transitions to an inner cusp with a shallow slope in logarithmic coordinates .",
    "the favored theory for core formation posits that cores are formed when stars are ejected from the galaxy s center by the decay of a binary bh created in a merger @xcite .",
    "the size of the core then reflects the total mass ejected , which should be a function of @xmath7 the size of the core may thus be an independent witness of @xmath7 in bcgs and other galaxies of similar luminosity , galaxy luminosity is more closely related to the physical scale of the cores than @xmath2 and the observed core size @xmath3 relationship for galaxies with cores and directly measured black hole masses appears to be consistent with the @xmath1 relationship .",
    "a second set of arguments come from considering the formation of bcgs .",
    "if bcgs are formed in `` dry '' mergers , then the ratio of black hole to stellar mass should be preserved over mergers , leading to the observed @xmath1 relationship .",
    "in contrast , @xmath9 may change little over such mergers , and no longer track black hole mass as well it does for the less luminous galaxies from which the @xmath0 has been determined .",
    "lastly , we consider the relative predictions of the @xmath1 and @xmath0 relationships for the volume mass distribution function of black holes and which we compare to the predictions from qso luminosity functions .",
    "a decisive discrimination between the two relationships is not possible without a better understanding of the cosmic scatter in both relationships , but the @xcite version of the @xmath1 relationship probably predicts too few high mass black holes to support the qso luminosity function .",
    "we start by comparing the two predictions @xmath28 ( @xmath3 predicted from the @xmath0 relationship ) and @xmath29 ( @xmath3 predicted from the @xmath1 relationship ) for a sample of 219 galaxies for which we have central structural parameters derived from _",
    "imagery @xcite .",
    "we then present the separate relationships between core structure versus @xmath9 and @xmath30 this leads in turn to two separate predictions for how core size should be related to @xmath16 which can be compared to the observed relationship between core size and @xmath3 for 11 core galaxies that have direct @xmath3 determinations .",
    "the galaxy sample combines several different _ hst _ imaging programs that all used the nuker - law parameterization @xcite to characterize the central starlight distributions .",
    "the properties and definition of this sample are presented in detail in @xcite , but briefly , we combine surface photometry presented in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . this diverse source material has been transferred to a common photometric system ( @xmath31band ) and a common distance scale , adopting @xmath32 km s@xmath33 mpc@xmath34 the primary source of distances is the sbf survey of @xcite , but when possible we use the group memberships in @xcite and average sbf distances over the group . as the @xcite sbf scale is consistent with @xmath35 we scale up their sbf distances by 6% .",
    "the treatment of galaxies not in the sbf survey is detailed in @xcite .",
    "the sample is listed in table [ tab : glob ] .",
    "it comprises 120 core galaxies , 87 power - law galaxies , and 12 intermediate galaxies .",
    "the most important nuker - law parameter for the present analysis is the break radius , @xmath36 which is used to calculate the cusp radius , @xmath6 which in turn is used to represent the physical scale of the core ( this parameter is discussed in detail in @xmath37 and appendix [ sec : rgam2 ] ) .",
    "the average error in @xmath10 is 30% , based on comparison of nuker parameters to non - parametric estimates of the same parameters .",
    "central velocity dispersions are provided by the `` hyperleda '' augmentation of the @xcite compendium of published velocity dispersions ; no values were available for 30 of the total of 219 galaxies .",
    "we adopt a 10%  typical error in @xmath27 the @xmath0 relationship as initially presented by @xcite used the average luminosity - weighted velocity dispersion measured in a slit along the major axis interior to the effective radius .",
    "velocity dispersion profiles are unfortunately not available for the bulk of the galaxies ; however , @xcite showed that the central values are likely to be within 5%  of the radial averages .",
    "the sources of the present galaxy luminosities are discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "most of the magnitudes are derived from @xmath38 or @xmath39 values drawn from the rc3 @xcite .",
    "bulge luminosities are given for s0 and spiral galaxies based on bulge / disk decompositions in the literature .",
    "absolute luminosities were calculated using the @xcite galactic extinction values ; we assume a typical @xmath40 error of 10% .",
    "the accuracy of the bcg luminosities is of special concern as we will argue that they imply higher @xmath3 than would be inferred from the @xmath9 values for the same galaxies .",
    "the present bcg luminosities are based on fitting @xmath41 laws to the inner portions ( @xmath42 kpc ) of the r - band @xcite brightness profiles , limiting the fits to radii that are well matched by this function .",
    "@xcite show that bcg brightness profiles are better described by s ' ersic  profiles with s ' ersic  @xmath43 which is also true of giant elliptical galaxies in general ( e.q .",
    "however , bcgs with s ' ersic  @xmath43 typically have extremely large effective radii that are factors of several larger than the actual radial limit of the surface photometry ; this in turn implies unrealistically large total luminosities .",
    "the @xmath41 laws give a conservative lower limit for bcg total luminosities .",
    "even so , the derived luminosities are systematically much larger than those provided by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "we resolve this issue in appendix [ sec : bcg ] with a demonstration that the sdss bcg luminosities are strongly biased to low values by excessive sky subtraction .",
    "the nir apparent magnitudes provided by the 2mass extended source catalogue @xcite have also been used to provide bcg total luminosities @xcite ; however in appendix [ sec:2mass ] we show that the 2mass apparent magnitudes are also likely to be underestimates .",
    "a separate issue raised by a number of our colleagues is that bcg luminosities may need to be `` corrected '' for intracluster light ( icl ) .",
    "one such treatment of icl assumes that the bcg is coincident with the center of the cluster potential , and that the composite bcg+icl can be modeled as two superimposed @xmath41 laws ( cf .",
    "the icl component is then subtracted to yield the `` true '' bcg luminosity .",
    "a key feature of such models is that the icl profile is assumed to continue to rise in brightness at radii well interior to where it dominates , thus implying a substantial contribution at even small radii .",
    "there is little physical justification for a correction of this form , however .",
    "as noted above , giant elliptical galaxies in general ( not just bcgs ) have s ' ersic  @xmath44 further , the presumption that bcgs sit exactly at the center of their clusters is an idealization that is actually realized in only a small fraction of systems .",
    "@xcite show that bcgs are typically displaced from the geometric cluster center by @xmath45 kpc in projection and @xmath46 in velocity .",
    "@xcite showed that bcgs are typically displaced from the centroid of cluster x - ray emission by 129 kpc , consistent with the @xcite analysis .",
    "lastly , the presumption that the icl follows an @xmath41 law into small radii is not uniquely demanded , and is probably inconsistent with the large velocity dispersion of stars truly not bound to the bcg .",
    "again , bcgs are well described over a large radial range by s ' ersic  laws ; in no case in the @xcite sample are there any profiles that have a distinct feature that objectively supports a two component model .",
    "this is not to say that icl is not present , but the surface brightness at which it dominates even in the two component models are well outside the radii at which we measure the @xmath41 laws used to estimate total luminosity ( typically less than 50 kpc ) .",
    "the @xcite models of icl show that it begins to dominate the bcgs at @xmath47 kpc from the bcg centers , corresponding to @xmath48 we conclude that a strong correction to our bcg luminosities for icl is poorly justified .",
    "the @xmath1 relationship emerged from the first attempts to relate black hole mass to properties of the host galaxy @xcite .",
    "much of the recent work on this problem , however , has focused on the @xmath0 relationship due to its apparent smaller scatter ( although see @xcite on the significance of this ) , as well as arguments that @xmath2 rather than galaxy luminosity is the more fundamental parameter that determines how galaxies were formed ( e.g. , @xcite ) . while @xmath8 and @xmath9 are related by the @xcite relationship , since the discovery that galaxies lie on a `` fundamental - plane '' determined by @xmath18 @xmath2 and the effective radius , @xmath13 @xcite , we know that neither @xmath8 nor @xmath9 alone is sufficient to codify the full range of galaxy properties .",
    "the @xmath1 relationship thus may contain information that is not a trivial projection of the @xmath0 relationship .",
    "the relationship between @xmath3 and @xmath8 is shown in figure [ fig : ml ] .",
    "most of the galaxies shown are those presented in @xcite , determinations in ngc 1399 @xcite , ngc 3031 @xcite , ngc 3998 @xcite , ngc 4374 @xcite , ngc 4486b @xcite , ngc 4945 @xcite , ngc 5128 @xcite , ngc 7332 @xcite , and cygnus a @xcite . ] transformed to @xmath49 due to the large scatter of the data points in figure [ fig : ml ] , estimating a mean @xmath1 relationship is likely to be sensitive to the fitting algorithm .",
    "we have elected to use the `` symmetric '' least - squares algorithm of @xcite throughout this analysis .",
    "this technique allows for errors in both variables being fitted , and finds the best slope and intercept parameters without assigning either parameter as the independent or dependent variable . as a way of bracketing uncertainties in the mean @xmath1 relationship",
    ", we performed one fit using all the data points , but for a second fit we used only galaxies with @xmath50 because they appear to have less scatter .",
    "the fit to all data points gives @xmath51 which is shown as the dashed line in figure [ fig : ml ] .",
    "just fitting galaxies with @xmath52 gives @xmath53 which is shown as the dotted line in figure [ fig : ml ] .",
    "both relationships agree well for @xmath54 their differences in slope cause them to diverge slightly when extrapolated to more luminous galaxies .",
    "both relationships also agree well with the @xcite relationship between @xmath3 and galaxy _ mass _ transformed back to luminosity , which we consider as a third @xmath1 relationship .",
    "@xcite found that the @xmath3-mass relationship was not significantly less tight than the @xmath0 relationship , given the errors of the various samples .",
    "if so , then the reduced scatter in the @xmath3-mass relationship means that it should serve well as a relationship between @xmath3 and @xmath55 we transform it by adopting @xmath56 based on the @xmath57 estimates given in @xcite ; this gives @xmath58 this is shown in figure [ fig : ml ] as the solid line ; within errors it is essentially identical to equation ( [ eqn : ml_all ] ) for @xmath59 the interval over which we will be extrapolating the @xmath1 relationship to the most luminous galaxies in the sample .",
    "figure [ fig : bh_pred ] shows @xmath29 based on a combination of the three relationships presented in figure [ fig : ml ] plotted against @xmath28 from equation ( [ eqn : msig ] ) for the sample .",
    "the error bars along the @xmath29 axis reflect the minimum and maximum predictions of @xmath3 given by the three relationships shown in figure [ fig : ml ] ; the central values plotted are the mean of the minimum and maximum predicted @xmath7 the @xmath8 and @xmath9 predictors diverge at large @xmath18 with all three @xmath1 relationships predicting @xmath60 for the most luminous galaxies , while equation ( [ eqn : msig ] ) predicts no values of @xmath3 larger than @xmath61 the errors in @xmath29 increase somewhat with galaxy luminosity but are much smaller than the differences between @xmath29 and @xmath62 which approach an order of magnitude for some of the most luminous galaxies . do not include the systematic errors associated with the uncertainties in the individual relationships themselves . ]",
    "the differences between @xmath29 and @xmath28 can not be reconciled by the @xcite log - quadratic @xmath0 relationship .",
    "the asymmetric error bars in the @xmath9-based predictions of @xmath3 shown in figure [ fig : bh_pred ] reflect the implied change in predicted @xmath3 if the @xcite relationship is used instead of the @xcite log - linear @xmath0 relationship .",
    "the @xcite relationship predicts slightly larger @xmath3 only for the largest @xmath9 values ( @xmath63 ) , but still does not match the even larger @xmath29 for the same galaxies .",
    "as expected , @xmath29 and @xmath28 do agree on average for the sample galaxies that actually have direct @xmath3 determinations , since it was this subset of galaxies that defined the relationships in the first place .",
    "the disagreement of the two @xmath3 predictors for the larger set of galaxies lacking direct @xmath3 determinations can be traced to changes in the form of the @xmath64 relationship as a function of galaxy luminosity .",
    "figure [ fig : mv_sig ] shows this relationship for the sample galaxies .",
    "the typical @xmath9 value appears to level off for large @xmath8 ; indeed , there appears to be little relationship between @xmath9 and @xmath8 for galaxies with @xmath65 while most of the galaxies in this luminosity range are bcgs , other bright ellipticals show the same behavior .",
    "put simply , the high luminosities of bcgs and other similarly bright ellipticals are not matched by similarly large velocity dispersions .",
    "the @xmath0 relationship thus predicts unexceptional black hole masses for these exceptionally luminous galaxies .",
    "this `` saturation '' in @xmath9 at bcg luminosities was noted in the bcg velocity dispersion study of @xcite , but it appears only weakly in the sdss study of @xcite .",
    "we suggest that this may be due to the use of different bcg luminosities , based on the analysis of the sdss magnitudes of bcgs presented in appendix [ sec : bcg ] . for the core galaxies ,",
    "we find @xmath66 a much steeper relationship than the classic @xmath67 specifically , a symmetrical least - squares fit @xcite to the 99 core galaxies with @xmath68 and having a @xmath9 value produces : @xmath69 however , since the @xmath64 relationship appears to be nonlinear , even this fit may not be the best approximation for the most luminous galaxies .",
    "this result also contrasts with the relationship measured for power - law galaxies alone , @xmath70    the distribution of points with @xmath3 measurements shows what appears to be a bias in the bh sample : galaxies with @xmath71 with measured @xmath3 have a higher - than - average @xmath9 than typical galaxies at this luminosity  or conversely have low luminosities for their @xmath9 values ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the 7 galaxies with measured @xmath3 at @xmath71 have average @xmath72 while equation ( [ eqn : fj ] ) predicts only @xmath73 at @xmath71 in agreement with the average @xmath9 at this luminosity for the sdss sample @xcite . if @xmath9 is the best predictor of @xmath16 then the black holes in these galaxies should be on average @xmath74 more massive than is typical for galaxies with @xmath75 the @xmath1 relationship in turn would be biased at the high luminosity end , and the large black hole masses predicted from @xmath8 shown in figure [ fig : bh_pred ] will be over - estimates .",
    "conversely , if @xmath8 is the better predictor of @xmath16 then then the @xmath0 relationship would be biased to predict lower @xmath3 than would be correct .",
    "the possibility that the galaxies with measured @xmath3 are a biased sampling of the @xmath64 relationship is echoed in figure [ fig : bh_pred ] . for @xmath76 @xmath29 is on average greater that @xmath28 for galaxies in the present sample .",
    "lowering @xmath29 by the bias factor inferred above , or increasing @xmath28 by a similar factor would bring the average predictions into excellent agreement , however . note the galaxies with measured @xmath3 in figure [ fig : bh_pred ] , are presently in excellent agreement , since these are the very systems used to define the @xmath0 and @xmath1 relationships .",
    "figure [ fig : bh_pred ] also shows , however , that the large @xmath29 predicted for the most luminous galaxies still deviate from @xmath28 by a much larger factor than this putative bias .",
    "the strong curvature in @xmath64 relationship leads to the upward curvature in @xmath29 versus @xmath28 well in excess of the selection biases implied by figure [ fig : mv_sig ] . any luminosity - based predictor of @xmath3 calibrated for @xmath77 would still predict @xmath3 in excess of the @xmath0 relationship for @xmath78 since @xmath9 for the brightest galaxies does not increase with luminosity .",
    "resolving whether @xmath8 or @xmath9 is the best predictor for @xmath3 for galaxies with @xmath79 will only be possible when real @xmath3 determinations can be made in this luminosity regime . lacking this",
    ", we can attempt to obtain preliminary information by considering whether the central structure of galaxies may provide an independent witness to @xmath7 we characterize the physical scale of the core by the `` cusp radius , '' @xmath6 which is the radius at which the negative logarithmic - slope of a galaxy s surface brightness profile reaches a pre - specified value @xmath80 this measure of core size was first proposed by @xcite ; we will discuss it in detail in appendix [ sec : rgam2 ] .",
    "the core is also characterized by the cusp brightness , @xmath81 the local surface brightness at @xmath10 ( @xmath82 is @xmath83 expressed in magnitude units ) . in terms of the nuker - law parameters , for @xmath84 @xmath85 @xmath83 is then found directly from the fitted nuker - law , @xmath86^{(\\gamma-\\beta)/\\alpha}. \\label{eqn : rgam}\\ ] ] @xcite advocated use of @xmath10 with @xmath87 as a core scale - parameter .",
    "we show in appendix [ sec : rgam2 ] that using @xmath10 with @xmath88 indeed gives tighter correlations with other galaxy parameters than the choice of @xmath89 as a scale parameter .",
    "while the nuker - law @xmath89 is still used to calculate @xmath6 we no longer use it directly as a measure of core size , in contrast to the analysis presented in @xcite .",
    "lastly , we emphasize that since @xmath10 is generally well interior to @xmath89 it is not meant to describe the actual complete extent of the core ; it is just a convenient representative scale .",
    "it has long been known that the physical scale of cores in early - type galaxies is correlated with galaxy luminosity @xcite .",
    "this relationship may be due to the action of central black holes on the central distribution of stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "figures [ fig : sigrc ] and [ fig : mvrc ] show the relationships between @xmath2 @xmath18 and cusp radius , @xmath6 for the present sample .",
    "the @xmath90 relationship is particularly steep , as @xmath10 varies by over two orders of magnitude , while @xmath9 changes by only a factor of two . for core galaxies with @xmath91",
    "a symmetrical least - squares fit gives @xmath92 while the @xmath93 relationship is @xmath94 of the two relationships , @xmath8 is the better predictor of @xmath6 with only 0.31 rms scatter in @xmath95 while the scatter of @xmath96 versus @xmath9 is 0.63 .",
    "note that bcgs and non - bcg core galaxies appear to follow the same relationships between @xmath10 and @xmath9 or @xmath30 for the non - bcg core galaxies , @xmath97 and @xmath98 while for the bcgs , @xmath99 and @xmath100 while the slopes of the relationships are different from those for the entire sample of core galaxies , there is no significant difference between the relationships within the parameter ranges in which bcgs and non bcgs overlap .",
    "a critical result that is evident in figure [ fig : mvrc ] is that while bcgs have larger cores than less luminous core galaxies , they are completely consistent with the larger total luminosity of bcgs . in contrast , there is essentially no correlation between @xmath10 and @xmath9 for @xmath101 pc , as is evident in figure [ fig : sigrc ] ; luminosity is a much better predictor of core size in bcgs than @xmath27    the core is characterized by a surface brightness as well as a physical scale , thus one could also explore the relationships between @xmath83 and @xmath9 or @xmath18 but as we show in figure [ fig : rc_ic ] , @xmath83 and @xmath10 are so closely related that they can be regarded as interchangeable .",
    "the fitted relationship between the two parameters for core galaxies with @xmath68 is @xmath102 where @xmath82 is @xmath83 in units of @xmath31band magnitudes per square - arcsecond .",
    "lastly , @xmath83 and @xmath10 can be combined to estimate the stellar mass of the core interior to the cusp as @xmath103 again using the conversion between mass and light given in the context of equation ( [ eqn : ml_hr ] ) .",
    "symmetrical fits give the relationships between @xmath104 and @xmath8 or @xmath9 as ; @xmath105 and @xmath106        the existence of the @xmath90 and @xmath93 relationships implies empirical relationships between @xmath10 and @xmath16 given the separate @xmath0 and @xmath1 relationships . by combining equation ( [ eqn : msig ] ) with equation ( [ eqn : r_sig ] ) we find @xmath107 or more precisely , @xmath108 at the same time , we can also combine equations ( [ eqn : r_mv ] ) and ( [ eqn : ml_hr ] ) to find @xmath109 or @xmath110 equations ( [ eqn : mbh_rs ] ) and ( [ eqn : mbh_rl ] ) are inconsistent .",
    "the conflict between @xmath29 and @xmath28 leads in turn to contradictory predictions for how the physical scale of cores is related to black hole mass .",
    "comparison of the observed @xmath11 relationship to the two inferred relationships presented above may offer a path to determining which of @xmath28 or @xmath29 is more accurate for the most massive galaxies . in the `` core - scouring '' scenario , cores are created by the orbital decay of a massive binary black hole , which would be formed during the merging of two galaxies . as the merger progresses , black holes in the nuclei of the progenitor galaxies are brought to the center of the merged system by dynamical friction .",
    "while the center of the merger may initially be highly concentrated @xcite , as is the case for power - law galaxies , central stars interacting with the binary black hole are ejected from the center as the binary hardens .",
    "the ejection of stars erodes the steep central stellar density profile , creating a shallow cusp , or break from the steeper profile that still persists at larger radii .",
    "a core is the region of the galaxy interior to the break ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    under this hypothesis , the relationship between core scale and @xmath3 ought to be more fundamental than either of the @xmath90 or @xmath93 relationships alone .",
    "the action of the black hole mass on stellar orbits at the galaxy center _ creates the core structure directly , _ and the @xmath90 and @xmath93 relationships are then merely consequences of the separate @xmath0 and @xmath1 relationships . according to this logic , we would conclude that the larger cores of bcgs are evidence of higher bh masses .",
    "a major caveat standing in the way of this conclusion is that core scouring may not lead directly to a clean relationship between @xmath10 and @xmath7 the binary bh ejects a total mass of stars , @xmath111 that is expected to be proportional to the total merged @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "however , the resultant @xmath10 would depend on the radii over which stars are ejected from the center . further",
    ", @xcite presents simulations that show that core formation should be a cumulative process .",
    "cores formed in one merger event will be depleted even further in subsequent mergers , presumably leading to even larger increases in @xmath10 that would reflect not only the total bh mass , but the integrated merger history as well . under this hypothesis",
    ", cores resulting from successive dry mergers would be abnormally large compared to their bh masses , potentially explaining the extra - large cores of bcgs , which are thought to be formed by such multiple mergers . under scrutiny",
    ", however , this explanation seems difficult to support , since the cores of bcgs show no excess _ compared to the luminosities of their host galaxies , _ and it is this latter quantity that is probably the best indicator of the amount of dry merging that any massive elliptical has experienced . in other words , the core masses of bcgs galaxies are the same fixed fraction of their total light as in other galaxies , not some amplified value driven by multiple mergers .",
    "thus , we seem to be driven back to the basic explanation that the larger cores of bcgs are due simply to larger bh masses .    can we use actual core data to identify the correct @xmath11 relationship ?",
    "figure [ fig : bh_rc ] tries this by plotting @xmath10 versus @xmath3 for the 11 core galaxies for which there are direct determinations of @xmath7 a symmetric fit to @xmath10 and @xmath3 for these galaxies has the form @xmath112 this equation is essentially consistent with equation ( [ eqn : mbh_rl ] ) , the relationship inferred from @xmath113 rather than equation ( [ eqn : mbh_rs ] ) , which inferred from @xmath114 at the same time , the scatter in figure [ fig : bh_rc ] is large , thus this result is sensitive to how the @xmath11 relationship is fitted .",
    "for example , if @xmath10 is treated as the independent variable in an attempt to predict @xmath16 given @xmath6 then @xmath115 ( although we express @xmath10 as the dependent variable for comparison with the relationships above ) .",
    "the slope of this relationship is intermediate between that in equations ( [ eqn : mbh_rs ] ) and ( [ eqn : mbh_rl ] ) .",
    "for completeness , if @xmath3 is treated as the independent variable , which corresponds to the scouring hypothesis that @xmath3 determines @xmath6 then @xmath116    these three fits do not in fact suffice to identify the ",

    "figures [ fig : mv_sig ] to [ fig : rc_ic ] ) , and any new fit based on these galaxies might therefore not be representative .",
    "on this last point , we emphasize caution .",
    "while the galaxies with measured @xmath3 may on average have offsets in the parameter plots shown , this does not mean _ a priori _ that the directly observed @xmath11 relationship is biased .",
    "the small number of core galaxies with measured @xmath3 plus the number of parameters in play means that understanding any biases must await a richer sample .",
    "likewise , the sample of core galaxies with measured @xmath3 will have to be increased considerably before it can be used to convincingly discriminate between the @xmath29 and @xmath28 relations .",
    "nevertheless , we may be able to obtain some guidance in advance of such observations by comparing @xmath3 estimated from @xmath10 to values estimated from @xmath8 or @xmath27 figure [ fig : bh_rgpred ] shows the results of using either equation ( [ eqn : mbh_r_fit ] ) or ( [ eqn : mbh_r_ind ] ) to predict @xmath3 from @xmath6 in analogy to figure [ fig : bh_pred ] , which compared predictions of @xmath3 based on @xmath9 versus @xmath30 both versions of the @xmath11 relationship predict larger @xmath3 than would be inferred from @xmath114 the symmetrically - fitted @xmath11 in equation ( [ eqn : mbh_r_fit ] ) appears to be consistent with @xmath113 also predicting @xmath117 for the most massive galaxies .",
    "presently , the large scatter in the observed @xmath11 relationship and the attendant uncertainties in any empirical relationship derived from it does not decisively favor @xmath29 over @xmath114 equations ( [ eqn : mbh_r_fit ] ) and ( [ eqn : mbh_r_ind ] ) however , on average predict greater @xmath3 than would be inferred from @xmath62 while equation ( [ eqn : mbh_r_fit ] ) is consistent with the larger black hole masses implied by @xmath8 for the most massive galaxies .",
    "at this early stage the @xmath11 relationship thus may favor consistency with the @xmath29 relationship .",
    "the fact that the scatter of @xmath10 on @xmath8 is smaller than that on @xmath9 ( as would be expected if @xmath10 is produced directly by black hole scouring and @xmath3 correlates more closely with @xmath8 ) as well as the fact that @xmath29 plausibly explains the large core of bcgs as being due to more massive black holes , whereas @xmath28 seems to provide no ready explanation this , may offer additional support that @xmath29 is more appropriate for the most massive galaxies .      an alternative approach to explore the relationship between core structure and black hole mass is to compare the core mass , @xmath118 , rather than @xmath6 to @xmath7 although , as we noted earlier , @xmath83 and @xmath10 are closely related , so the relationship between @xmath104 and @xmath3 will contain information similar to the @xmath11 relationship , core mass should be a more direct indicator of the amount of core scouring and its relationship to black hole mass . if cores are created from power - law galaxies by core scouring following a dry merger",
    ", one might expect that the core mass would be approximately proportional to the black - hole mass .",
    "this conjecture is supported by n - body calculations by @xcite , who argues that the core mass produced by scouring in a single merger is @xmath119 , where @xmath3 is the mass of the merged black hole and @xmath120 , largely independent of the mass ratio of the merging black holes ; he also argues that the total core mass after @xmath121 dry mergers should be given by @xmath122 .",
    "direct estimation of the mass ejected from the core by scouring is much more difficult observationally than theoretically , because we do not know the state of the galaxy before the merger .",
    "thus we will simply use @xmath104 as an  indicative \" core mass , recognizing that the factor @xmath123 relating indicative core mass to black - hole mass is very uncertain , but should be approximately independent of galaxy luminosity for core galaxies .",
    "figure [ fig : corem ] shows the relationships between @xmath104 and @xmath3 as derived from the @xmath0 and @xmath1 relationships . by combining @xmath28 ( equation [ eqn : msig ] ) with the @xmath124 relationship ( equation [ eqn : mc_sig ] ) , we find @xmath125 while the combinations of @xmath29 ( equation [ eqn : ml_hr ] ) with the @xmath126 relationship ( equation [ eqn : mc_l ] ) gives @xmath127 the relation between indicative core mass and black - hole mass predicted by the @xmath1 relation is essentially linear , as expected , while the relation predicted by the @xmath0 relation is twice as steep .",
    "moreover the ratio of indicative core mass to black - hole mass is @xmath128 at @xmath129 from the @xmath1 relation , not far from the value of order unity that we might expect , while the corresponding value from the @xmath0 relation is @xmath130 .",
    "it is difficult to devise dynamical models in which core scouring could be efficient enough to create cores with mass so much bigger than the black - hole mass .",
    "having found suggestive but not conclusive arguments to prefer one relation over the other , we turn now to physical arguments for additional guidance . we stress again that the tension between @xmath29 and @xmath28 arises due to the breakdown , or curvature , in the @xmath64 relationship at high galaxy masses .",
    "it is appropriate to inquire at least briefly into physical reasons why this might happen , and whether this offers insight into which of @xmath29 and @xmath28 might be preferred for the most massive galaxies .",
    "curvature in a gravitational scaling relation may signal a breakdown in perfect homology in galaxy formation , which in turn may reflect a change in the relative importance of different physical processes as a function of galaxy size .",
    "one such effect , suggested some time ago , is an increase in the importance of dissipationless ( i.e. ,  dry \" ) merging in forming the most massive ellipticals @xcite .",
    "a second effect , following logically from the first , is a change in the nature of dissipationless mergers with galaxy mass . as hierarchical clustering proceeds , clusters of galaxies become more massive , and previously formed elliptical galaxies at the centers of these clusters merge .",
    "each new round of merging thus increases the galaxy stellar mass along with the cluster dark halo mass in which it is embedded .",
    "the largest ellipticals are thus produced by dry mergers at the centers of the largest clusters .",
    "these are bcgs .",
    "the above scenario is supported by the steep environmental dependence among bright ellipticals , the brightest ones being found in the densest environments @xcite .",
    "there are at least two trends that might contribute to a breakdown in perfect homology for dry merging to produce the observed curvature in the @xmath64 relationship .",
    "the first is a change in the typical orbital eccentricity of central merging pairs as cluster mass grows .",
    "@xcite have suggested that head - on collisions may become more frequent when massive clusters merge , and their n - body simulations indicate less loss of energy from stars to dark matter in such collisions .",
    "the resultant stellar remnants are puffed up in radius and have significantly lower stellar velocity dispersions compared to encounters with normal orbital geometry .",
    "a second effect , not considered by them , is the fact that the ratio of cluster velocity dispersion to internal galaxy velocity dispersion also rises as clustering proceeds .",
    "this appears to happen because gas cooling is reduced in large dark - matter halos ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which means that the baryonic masses of central galaxies grow more slowly than their dark - matter halos .",
    "this is why the stellar velocity dispersions within bcg galaxies in large clusters are so much lower than those of their surrounding clusters , whereas the same is not true of ellipticals in small groups ( cf .",
    "figure 2 of @xcite ) .",
    "the net result is that central merging pairs will approach each other at relatively higher speeds , with the potential of injecting more orbital kinetic energy into the final stellar remnant .",
    "this would also cause the remnant to puff up and have smaller final velocity dispersion .",
    "the relative importance of these two effects can only be decided using realistic two - component n - body simulations containing both stars and dark matter that are appropriately embedded in a cosmological clustering scenario .",
    "it seems probable that both effects will be found to play a role .",
    "the point for now is that there are at least two reasons to expect non - homology in dissipationless mergers , and thus two reasons for curvature in the @xmath64 relationship .",
    "if this logic is correct , it points towards @xmath29 as being the proper scaling law for massive galaxies .",
    "that is because the major growth in black hole mass during dissipationless merging occurs by merging black holes as the galaxies themselves merge . with little mass accretion directly onto black holes during this stage and no attendant star formation , black hole mass should increase in proportion to galaxy mass .",
    "the ratio of stellar mass to black hole mass is constant over dry merging , consistent with @xmath3 scaling linearly with galaxy mass .",
    "conversely , for @xmath28 to be maintained over dry merging , given the plateau in @xmath9 at high galaxy luminosity , would require one of the two merging black holes to be ejected from the galaxy as a common occurrence .",
    "these arguments provide yet a another reason to prefer the @xmath29 relation over @xmath114    regardless of which mechanism is dominant for determining the velocity dispersion of the merged galaxy ,  puffing - up \" of the remnant does appear to happen in the most luminous galaxies , supporting an overall scenario in which velocity dispersion in the largest galaxies does not increase strongly via mergers .",
    "the evidence for this comes from the effective radii of the largest galaxies ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ fig : mvre ] shows the @xmath131 relationship for the whole sample , where @xmath132 is the effective radius measured from @xmath41-law fits to those galaxies that have ground - based surface photometry extending to large radii @xcite . for low galaxy luminosity , the the mean @xmath131 relationship is relatively shallow .",
    "we find @xmath133 based on fits to just power - law galaxies .",
    "this stands in contrast to the steeper relationship defined by core galaxies with @xmath91 @xmath134 the transition between the two forms occurs at @xmath135 which corresponds to the luminosity at which the average central structure changes from power - law to core @xcite .",
    "this is also the scale at which @xmath9 starts to plateau in figure [ fig : mv_sig ]  the leveling - off of the @xmath64 relationship is thus associated with a rapid increase in @xmath132 with @xmath8 not seen in less luminous galaxies .",
    "this is as predicted if extra energy is injected into these galaxies by merging : the objects will have lower @xmath9 but larger @xmath136    it should be stressed that the arguments presented in support of the @xmath29 relation in this section apply only to bright ellipticals , which are those produced by _",
    "dissipationless _ merging .",
    "the mass - accretion processes that built black holes when galaxies were younger were drastically different and might have obeyed different scaling laws .",
    "the @xmath28 law might be a better fit to such galaxies , which in general will be smaller than the objects considered in this paper .",
    "the broader point of this discussion , however , is that  non - homology \" processes may have affected the growth of galaxies generally , with the result that a single black hole scaling law with global galaxy properties might not fit all galaxies .",
    "the preceding sections have presented suggestive if not conclusive reasons to suspect that the @xmath137 relation might be a better predictor of black hole mass than the @xmath138 relation for the most massive galaxies .    1",
    ".   the velocity dispersions of the most massive elliptical galaxies rises slowly if at all with galaxy luminosity implying that their black holes are no larger than those of much smaller ellipticals if @xmath138 is the governing relation  this seems rather surprising .",

    "the largest elliptical galaxies are believed to be formed by dry merging , which predicts that black hole mass should grow in proportion to stellar mass ; the observed @xmath140 relation is thus the simplest relation predicted on these grounds .",
    "by contrast , the saturation of black holes mass in the largest galaxies that is predicted by the @xmath0 relation requires that one of the two merging bhs be ejected from the galaxy as a common occurrence , which may not by natural .",

    "there are two different approaches that can be used to infer the present bh mass function from quasar counts ( specifically from the joint distribution of quasar numbers as a function of redshift and luminosity ) .",
    "one line , started by @xcite , relies on energy conservation . under that argument",
    ", the energy emitted by the quasars at any redshift propagates through the universe declining in co - moving density due to the redshift of the photons as @xmath181 , and thus behaves exactly like a background .",
    "hence the observed quasar flux translates directly to the total energy emitted given a known redshift distribution of emitters , and further translates into the total mass accreted by black holes , given their radiative efficiency .",
    "an alternate approach , started by @xcite , is to assume that all quasars go through a phase in which they accrete at the eddington limit , followed by a period of slower or intermittent accretion according to a universal model dependent on bh mass and time .",
    "this assumption , together with a continuity argument ( the number of bhs at a given mass changes only by accretion and merging ) permits the recovery , not merely of the local bh density , but also of the local bh mass function .",
    "this second approach achieves a more detailed result than the sotan argument , but at the expense of additional assumptions .",
    "a third more limited approach , which shares some logic with small - blanford , is to assume simply that the bhs of known mass accrete near the eddington limit for some period and to ignore their fainter growth period  the so called `` lightbulb model . '' in this model quasars are either on or off .",
    "because the number of luminous quasars in the universe varies strongly with time , the model does nt count bhs directly , rather it counts those that are accreting . in",
    "what follows , we evaluate the lightbulb model at @xmath182 where the top end of the quasar lf is largest .",
    "we assume that no bhs above @xmath183 are destroyed by mergers since that time , so the fall - off in the lf is due to a halt in accretion . at earlier times",
    "the bh mass function may be evolving .",
    "the full - width half maximum of the bright quasar lf is about @xmath184 yrs .",
    "so our lightbulb model implicitly assumes that every massive bh accretes for @xmath185 yrs , where @xmath123 is defined as the duty fraction , and then shuts off .",
    "this idealization ignores low mass bhs and low - level accretion .",
    "another significant limitation is that the model provides no procedure to identify the mass below which it fails , although that failure is implicit within the assumptions : some of the lower luminosity quasars must be high mass bhs accreting at less than their eddington limit .",
    "a third limitation is that the model is fundamentally inconsistent : the assignment of mass corresponding to a quasar luminosity gives the instantaneous mass of an accreting bh , while the present day mass function depends on its final mass .",
    "if the quasar is `` on '' for less than the salpeter time ( for bh mass to e - fold in eddington - limited accretion ) , then the problem is small , but if it is on for much longer than the salpeter time it is catastrophic : the present bh mass may be much larger than that assigned to the quasar .    nonetheless , the lightbulb model permits a comparison of the quasar lf with the number density of the most massive bhs in the local universe , with the duty fraction as a free parameter , under the assumption that the brightest objects in the quasar luminosity function are accreting near the eddington limit .",
    "this approach was used by @xcite to make a crude estimate of the duty fraction of bh accretion .",
    "we perform a similar analysis here .",
    "we start with the @xcite luminosity function at @xmath182 , where the bright quasar density is greatest .",
    "the @xcite fit reports number densities per magnitude at an ab absolute magnitude at rest - frame @xmath1861500 .",
    "we integrate their fitting function from a given luminosity to infinity to get a cumulative number of objects brighter than that luminosity , we apply a bolometric correction of 5 @xcite , and then we deduce a mass from the eddington limit .",
    "this procedure identifies the number density of bhs greater than a given mass accreting at a given redshift .",
    "we compute this cumulative density at redshift @xmath182 where the density of bright quasars is greatest .",
    "we divide this result by the duty fraction @xmath187 we adopt @xmath188 based on the extensive work by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this yields the line labeled `` lightbulb '' in figure [ fig : bh_mf ] .",
    "an improvement on both the lightbulb approach and the small - blandford approach is to use a physical model for the accretionary evolution of the bhs .",
    "one such model is the merger - induced accretion model that has been explored in detail by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they simulate the merger of disk+bulge+bh galaxies containing gas using the gadget code , treating the bh growth by computing the eddington - limited bondi accretion rate at their smallest resolution element .",

    "we summarize the salient points of their model below .",
    "the @xcite simulations exhibit very complex behavior of luminosity as a function of time for a given galaxy merger , but the time spent above a given luminosity turns out to be a universal profile over a wide range of galaxy or merger parameters , provided it is scaled appropriately with the peak luminosity and relic bh mass of the merger . for their simulations , the lifetime near a given bolometric luminosity l can be parametrized as @xmath189 where the timescale @xmath190 ( a crude quasar lifetime ) and luminosity scale @xmath191 are functions of the peak luminosity @xmath192 as follows .",

    "figure [ fig : bh_mf ] permits us to compare the lightbulb and hopkins models with the two relic bh mass functions .",
    "the bh mass functions diverge at about @xmath183 .",
    "the dispersion - based predictors predict considerably fewer bh at above @xmath183 than the luminosity - based predictors .",
    "they are not consistent with the lightbulb model ; consistency with the hopkins model is possible with the @xcite form of @xmath62 but with the assumption of more cosmic scatter in the @xmath0 relationship than is probably realistic .",
    "the luminosity - based mass function is barely consistent with the lightbulb model , but probably overpredicts the agn density compared to the hopkins model .",
    "we thus can not make a clear determination between the dispersion - based and luminosity - based bh mass predictors by comparing zero redshift bh demographics to quasar demographics ; however , the linear @xcite @xmath28 relationship is disfavored in all of the present models to explain the qso population .",
    "an important caveat is that our calculations have neglected the effects of dry merging on the most massive galaxies _",
    "after _ the epoch of qsos .",
    "merging might produce high mass black holes as a relatively recent phenomenon , thereby helping to reconcile the estimates made from @xmath29 with the qso population .",
    "another caveat for both results is the possibility of super - eddington accretion among the biggest bhs @xcite .",
    "if common , super - eddington accretion would make it very hard to make any estimates of the mass function of relic bhs from quasar lfs .",
    "the @xmath0 relationship has come to be the  gold standard \" for predicting black hole masses from galaxy properties due to its small scatter and its implications for illuminating the co - formation of galaxies and their nuclear black holes . at first sight",
    ", the @xmath1 relationship might be dismissed as a simple consequence of the faber - jackson relationship . with @xmath213 and @xmath214 one",
    "would expect something like @xmath215 the larger scatter in the @xmath1 relationship further suggests that the @xmath0 relationship is really more fundamental .",
    "but as galaxy luminosity increases , @xmath9 levels off and the basic faber - jackson relationship does not appear to hold . at bcg luminosities",
    "there are no direct measurements of @xmath3 and @xmath28 versus @xmath29 present contradictory extrapolations .",
    "the contradiction essentially begs the question , do these exceptionally luminous galaxies have exceptionally massive black holes ?",
    "the @xmath1 relationship answers this in the affirmative , while for the @xmath0 relationship to be correct we must accept the puzzling result that the black holes in bcgs have relatively modest masses .",
    "but this question leads to a broader issue , namely .",
    "is is there a significant population of black holes with @xmath3 approaching @xmath216 in the local universe ?    the best way to answer these questions is to attempt to weigh the bhs in bcgs . with the advent of laser - guided adaptive optics - fed spectrographs on 10 m class telescopes",
    ", it is now possible to do this .",
    "this paper may therefore be premature .",
    "however , given the high attention to the @xmath0 relationship and its implications for galaxy formation , we believe that advancing the implications of @xmath1 relationship offers an important alternative view that should not be overlooked . lacking hard measures of @xmath3 in the most massive galaxies",
    ", we have marshalled a number of less - direct arguments that this hypothesis may be favored for the most luminous galaxies .",
    "the first set of arguments is based on the hypothesis that cores in the most luminous galaxies are created in a `` core scouring '' process in which a binary bh created in the merger of two galaxies evacuates stars from the center of the newly - merged product .",
    "there presently is little observational support for the creation of binary black holes in mergers , but abundant theoretical work shows that realistic cores can be created by binary black holes , and the prevalence of nuclear black holes in galaxies overall strongly argues that such binaries must be created as a natural consequence of mergers .",
    "if so , the physical scale of cores , which we have parameterized as @xmath10 may be an independent witness of @xmath16 and thus use the large cores in bcgs as an indicator of their black hole masses .    based on central structural parameters derived from _",
    "hst _ observations , we find that the large cores in bcgs are commensurate with their high luminosities , while @xmath9 is a poor predictor of @xmath10 for @xmath101 pc .",
    "the scatter in the @xmath93 relationship is much smaller than that in the @xmath90 relationship , again implying that @xmath8 and core scale are more closely related .",
    "the observed @xmath11 relationship for 11 core galaxies with directly determined black hole masses has large scatter , but appears to be more consistent with the @xmath1 rather than the @xmath0 relationship .",
    "the core masses in bcgs are over an order of magnitude larger than the black hole masses estimated from @xmath62 but are only a few times larger than those estimated from @xmath217 making such large cores with the smaller @xmath9-based black hole masses would be a strong challenge for the core - scouring hypothesis of core formation .",
    "the second set of arguments comes from considering theoretical arguments concerning whether or not @xmath8 rather than @xmath9 should predict @xmath3 in bcgs .",
    "the favored origin of bcgs is that they are the remnants of dissipationless purely - stellar mergers of less - luminous elliptical galaxies , augmented by ongoing galactic cannibalism of elliptical galaxies in the rich environments at the center of galaxy clusters .",
    "the plateau in the @xmath64 relationship plus but the steeper @xmath218 relationship at high galaxy luminosity presented here strongly favor this formation scenario .",
    "the luminosity of a bcg is the sum of the luminosities of its progenitors .",
    "similarly , setting aside the possible ejection of nuclear black holes in the final stages of a merger , the final nuclear black hole mass should be the sum of the progenitor black holes .",
    "stated more directly , the ratio @xmath219 should be largely invariant over dissipationless mergers , leading to @xmath12 at the high end of the galaxy lf .",
    "in contrast , @xmath9 appears to be nearly constant over these mergers . in effect , even if a relationship between @xmath3 and @xmath9 were set up in the initial stages of galaxy formation , it might not survive in a dissipationless merging hierarchy .",
    "a final argument comes from attempting to infer the @xmath166 space density of the remnant black holes associated with the most luminous qsos seen at @xmath220 as noted in the introduction , the properties of the broad - line regions in the most luminous qsos argue that they are powered by black holes with @xmath221 the heating of the intra - cluster medium in the richest galaxy clusters may also demand that some black holes in bcgs approach this mass .",
    "the critical part of this analysis is understanding how to correct the qso space density for qso luminosity evolution .",
    "the remnant black holes last forever , but the qsos represent only those bhs made visible during an epoch of high mass - accretion , which presumably lasts only a small fraction of the age of the universe .",
    "we used the @xcite simulations to estimate the qso lifetimes . the resulting shape and",
    "space density of the bright end of the qso lf falls between the higher space density of the most massive black holes implied by @xmath29 and those implied by @xmath62 while the simple `` lightbulb '' model of qso duty cycles favors the @xmath29 relation .",
    "this treatment is sensitive to the assumed amount of cosmic scatter in both @xmath3 relationships ; however , it appears difficult for the log - linear @xmath0 relationship to explain the the observed space densities of the most luminous qsos without assuming that its cosmic scatter is larger than is likely to be the case .",

    "we also thank the referee for many excellent suggestions .",
    "our analysis depends critically on the accuracy of the absolute luminosities of the brightest galaxies in the sample , such as bcgs .",
    "this is underscored by the bright - end disagreements of our @xmath64 relationship and galaxy luminosity function with those based on sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data ( @xcite and @xcite , respectively ) .",
    "we thus describe the derivation of our bcg luminosities , and compare them to magnitudes based on the sdss for bcgs in common .",
    "we conclude that the sdss bcg magnitudes are strongly affected by sky subtraction errors , causing them to be biassed to significantly fainter values .",
    "the bcgs in the present sample come from the @xcite _ hst _ bcg study .",
    "this program , in turn , was based on the volume - limited @xcite bcg sample , which provides ground - based profiles and aperture photometry . as outlined in @xmath222",
    ", we derive apparent magnitudes of the bcgs by fitting the classic @xmath41 form to the inner portions of the brightness profiles , where the inner limit of the fit was set to avoid seeing and the outer limit was specified to avoid portions of the profile that appeared to rise _ above _ the @xmath41 fit .",
    "@xcite showed that the bcg profiles could be described by single - component @xcite forms , but ones that often had index @xmath44 the apparent magnitudes , which were derived by integrating the @xmath41-law over radius , thus if anything are _ underestimates _ of the total bcg fluxes .",
    "an alternative to this procedure would be to integrate the s ' ersic forms , however , as is shown in @xcite , the s ' ersic @xmath132 and @xmath223 values are closely coupled , such that large @xmath223 is matched with large @xmath13 the implied total magnitude strongly diverges as @xmath223 increases , and must essentially be regarded as unphysical extrapolations because the derived @xmath132 is typically well outside the actual radial domain of the surface brightness profile for large @xmath224 this is not true for @xmath225 a contrasting treatment that occurs in much of the literature is based on the presumption that bcg must be completely well described by @xmath41-laws ( in contrast to other giant elliptical galaxies , which also have @xmath226 ) , and that s ' ersic @xmath226 is really the signature of an intracluster light component that must be subtracted .",
    "we conclude that an unambiguous procedure to derive total bcg luminosity does not presently exist .",
    "our procedure of deriving magnitudes from just the inner portion of the profile that is well described by an @xmath41-law again should give a sensible lower limit to the total luminosity .",
    "the high luminosity end of the @xcite luminosity function falls well below the bcg space densities measured by @xcite .",
    "the @xcite @xmath64 relationship shows no plateau at its bright limit .",
    "these discrepancies would both be explained if the total magnitudes for bcgs in the sdss database are significantly underestimated .",
    "we checked this hypothesis by examining the 25 @xcite bcgs present in the sdss dr4 database . in detail , we compared the total @xmath227 apparent magnitude in @xcite against the sdss @xmath228 `` model magnitude , '' ( which in almost all cases is the most luminous total magnitude provided by the sdss database ) transformed by @xmath229 the results are shown in figure [ fig : sdss_comp ] as a function of effective radius ( based on our fits ) .",
    "a strong systematic trend is evident such that larger galaxies have greater offsets between the two total magnitudes .",
    "the median @xmath230 value is 0.54 mag and rises to 1.57 mag for the ngc 6166 ( the bcg in a2199 ) . as an additional check",
    ", we also compared the sdss @xmath228 magnitudes against the maximum @xmath227 aperture magnitude published by @xcite .",
    "the maximum aperture radius was not defined in any rigorous way and does not correspond to any fixed fraction of the total galaxy flux , but the magnitude is a model - independent integration of all the flux within the published radius .",
    "the median difference between the sdss model @xmath228 magnitudes ( transformed to @xmath227 ) and the maximum aperture magnitude is 0.24 mag and rises to values over a full magnitude for the largest galaxies .",
    "this demonstrates directly that the sdss model magnitudes for the galaxies in question can not be regarded as total magnitudes .    conversations with a number of experienced users of the sdss database for bright galaxies warned us that the sdss pipeline measured sky levels on angular scales too small to accommodate bright nearby bcgs of the sort observed by @xcite , and indeed the results shown in figure [ fig : sdss_comp ] strongly suggest that a sky - subtraction error affects the sdss magnitudes .",
    "as a check , we plot the sdss @xmath228 surface brightness profiles against the @xcite profiles for three of the bcgs with the largest magnitude differences in figure [ fig : profile ] .",
    "the sdss profiles agree well at small radii but all fall below the @xcite profiles at large radii , consistent with large sky subtraction errors .    the large sdss sky - subtraction errors for bright galaxies may have important implications for the @xcite and @xcite studies , but exactly how is not clear .",
    "both sdss studies are based on galaxy samples with higher mean redshifts than the @xcite sample .",
    "their bcgs should be angularly smaller and thus be less vulnerable to sky subtraction errors .",
    "typical bcgs in the sdss sample are listed in the @xcite sample of galaxy clusters identified from sdss galaxy catalogues .",
    "figure [ fig : bcg_lf ] shows a histogram of sdss model @xmath228 magnitudes ( converted to @xmath40 ) for the bcgs identified by @xcite compared to a histogram of all @xcite bcgs with @xmath40 based on their total @xmath227 magnitudes .",
    "there is a clear offset between the two samples , with the @xcite bcgs appearing to be typically one magnitude brighter than the @xcite bcgs .",
    "however , a histogram of sdss @xmath228 magnitudes for the 25 @xcite bcgs in common with sdss agrees well with the @xcite bcg histogram , yet these are the magnitudes shown to in be error .",
    "we conclude that the total magnitudes of nearby sdss bcgs are wrong .",
    "after the first version of this paper was posted on astro - ph , @xcite presented a @xmath1 relationship for bcgs based on apparent magnitudes extracted from the 2mass extended source catalogue ( xsc ) @xcite .",
    "the implied nir luminosity differential between bcgs and other giant elliptical galaxies is greatly reduced from that of the present work . as a result",
    ", the plateau in the @xmath64 relationship presented here is greatly reduced in the nir and the conflict between @xmath28 and @xmath29 is thus resolved . @xcite",
    "further suggest that the relatively higher luminosities inferred from the optical photometry may imply that the envelopes of the bcgs are extremely blue .",
    "we have not conducted a complete comparison of the present photometry with that provided by the 2mass xsc , but a spot check of a few systems makes it clear that the 2mass imagery from which the catalogue magnitudes were derived is extremely shallow compared to that of @xcite , which is the source of the @xmath231 band optical photometry ( transformed to @xmath17 ) used in this paper .",
    "the most likely explanation for the difference between the present and @xcite results is that the 2mass images are simply not deep enough to obtain accurate total luminosities of the bcgs , at least as represented by the automatic reductions used to generate the xsc magnitudes .",
    "figure [ fig : a0779i ] shows the @xmath232 band 2mass image of ngc 2832 , the bcg in a0779 compared to the central portion of the @xmath231 band image obtained by @xcite .",
    "the @xmath232 sky level is 15.67 magnitudes per square arcsecond versus the @xmath231 band sky level of 20.90 .",
    "accounting for the @xmath233 color in the center of the galaxy implies that the @xmath232 band has a sky level effectively @xmath234 brighter .",
    "further , the 2mass image is a 7.8s exposure obtained with a 1.3 m telescope as compared to the 200s @xmath231 image obtained with a 2.1 m telescope @xcite .",
    "the @xmath232 image is thus considerably shallower than the @xmath231 image as is evident in figure [ fig : a0779i ] .",
    "the galaxy envelope in the @xmath232 band image disappears into the noise at radii at which it is still clearly present in @xmath235 this problem is exacerbated in the @xmath236 and @xmath237 bands , which have yet brighter sky levels .    despite the much brighter @xmath232 sky level ,",
    "the @xmath232 and @xmath231 band profiles of the a0779 bcg are consistent , as is evident in figure [ fig : warp_2mass ] , which compares the @xmath231 profiles measured by @xcite to @xmath232 profiles derived by us from the 2mass archive images for the three bcgs shown earlier in figure [ fig : profile ] .",
    "the final @xmath232 band isophote shown for a0779 falls fully @xmath238 magnitudes below the sky level , but is still in agreement with the @xmath231 band profile within the large error bars , which represent a 0.004 magnitude error in the 2mass @xmath232 sky level .",

    "these values are in poor agreement with the xsc isophotal ( @xmath242 ) , and extrapolated ( @xmath243 ) @xmath244 values of 9.78 and 9.67 , respectively , however . the isophotal radius",
