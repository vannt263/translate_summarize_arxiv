    "since e. witten suggested that strange quark matter may be the true ground state of color interaction system @xcite , it has been of great interest to find such matter in reality .",
    "there are hitherto many kinds of attempts , which can be classified into two ways .",
    "one is to detect directly strange quark matter on earth or in space ( e.g. , the ground and the ams - ii observations of strangelets in cosmic rays ) , the other is to study distant objects by means of astrophysics ( e.g. , to identify quark stars with strangeness ) . as for the nature of quark matter of strange stars , current researchers are focusing on quark condensation in momentum space ( e.g. , 2sc , cfl and loff states ) .",
    "recently it has been proposed alternatively that quarks in strange quark matter with high density and low temperature may condense in position space ( i.e. , forming quark clusters which are _ not _ color - confined ) , and may be in a solid state when the temperature is much low @xcite .",
    "this kind of solid quark stars could be applied to explain well the discrepancy between the observed glitches and free - precessions of pulsars @xcite .    in the following sections , based on the idea of quark clustering , observational constrains on the nature of quark matter with quark clusters are derived .",
    "the 500ks chandra observation of rxj1856.5 - 3754 @xcite shows a featureless plank - like spectrum , which is not natural to be explained in the atmosphere models of normal neutron star .",
    "however , for the simplicity nature , the spectrum might be fitted well in a solid quark star model @xcite .",
    "but if a cluster possesses more charges , it may behave like an atom which should have complex energy levels and would thus show corresponding atomic features in the spectrum . because the observational low - band of thermal x - ray spectra is @xmath0 kev ,",
    "this kind of `` atomic features '' can not be observed if the charge number per cluster , @xmath1 , is not greater than @xmath2 . in order to explain the observational fact of featureless spectra , the number of quarks per cluster , @xmath3 ,",
    "ca nt be too large , because @xmath1 can be simply written as @xmath4 . in order to know the upper limit of @xmath3",
    ", we calculate electron density , @xmath5 , as well as baryon density @xmath6 near the surface of the star .",
    "as will be shown , these two parameters can be obtained by solving the charge neutrality equation and state equation of zero pressure @xcite , and are determined by three physical constant from mit bag model .",
    "the charge neutrality equation is @xmath7 and the zero - temperature equation of state is @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes up , down , and strange quarks , and electron ; @xmath10 , the thermal dynamic potentials ; @xmath11 , the chemical potentials ; and @xmath12 , the number densities .",
    "here we take the formulae in the appendix of @xcite to relate @xmath10 and @xmath11 , @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15+\\frac{3}{2}m_s^4\\ln[\\frac{\\mu_s+(\\mu_s^2-m_s^2)^{1/2}}{m_s}]\\\\ -\\frac{2\\alpha_s}{\\pi}[3\\{\\mu - s(\\mu_s^2-m_s^2)^{1/2}-m_s^2\\ln[\\frac{\\mu_s+(\\mu_s^2-m_s^2)^{1/2}}{\\mu_s}]\\}^2 - 2(\\mu_s^2-m_s^2)^2\\\\ -m_s^4\\ln^2\\frac{m_s}{\\mu_s}+6\\ln\\frac{\\rho_r}{\\mu_s}\\{\\mu_sm_s^2(\\mu_s^2-m_s^2)^{1/2}-m_s^4\\ln[\\frac{\\mu_s+(\\mu_s+(\\mu_s^2)-m_s^2)^{1/2}}{m_s}]\\ } ] ) , \\end{array}\\ ] ] @xmath16 beside eqs.(1)-(6 ) , as a result of weak - interaction equilibriums between quarks and electrons , the chemical potential @xmath17 of them have the following relations , @xmath18 @xmath19 we have also the relations between the number densities and the thermodynamic potentials , @xmath20    using above equations , the number densities of quarks and electrons can be obtained , which are found to be dependent only on three parameters of mit bag model : the vacuum energy density @xmath21 , strange quark mass @xmath22 , and strong interaction coupling constant @xmath23 .",
    "our results show that for some value of these parameters the electron density can drop to zero very fast . beyond these parameter values ,",
    "no solution for @xmath5 exists any more .",
    "fig [ fig : ctb ] shows the electron densities as parameters of @xmath22 and @xmath23 for different @xmath21 .",
    "it is found that low @xmath22 and/or high @xmath23 favor low @xmath5 .",
    "this means that the electric field occurred on the quark - star surface could be very weak if @xmath22 is low and/or @xmath23 is high .",

    "the maximum value of quark number in a clusters , @xmath27 , is calculated .",
    "fig [ fig : ncl ] shows the results of @xmath27 for different parameters in the mit bag model ( we choose @xmath28 in the computations ) .",
    "we find that the maximum quark number in clusters can vary in a very large range of values . for @xmath29 and @xmath30",

    "it was pointed out by @xcite that if strange quark stars are in a solid state , pulsar glitches could be understood well by a sudden release of elastic energy accumulated when the shape of a star changes as its spin slows down .",
    "the elastic energy of a solid quark star is microscopically the sum of bond - energies of all links between clusters , and is determined by the strength of interactions and the sizes ( i.e. , @xmath3 ) of clusters .",
    "unfortunately up to now the strength of interaction ca nt be calculated from first principles .",
    "we suppose thus its value to be of the same order of the chemical potential of quarks ; that is within @xmath34 . by input different strengthes of interactions by hand ,",
    "we can obtain the magnitude of corresponding elastic energy .",
    "a strange star should be in a solid state before a glitch occurs due to increasing elastic energy .",
    "there are generally two kinds of movement that are against the solidification of strange stars ; one is thermal motion , and the other is the quantum uncertainty ( i.e. , the zero - point energy ) . from the x - ray observation , we know that the thermal energy may be at the magnitude of @xmath35 . the zero - point energy can be written as @xmath36 if quark clusters are moving non - relativistically , where @xmath37^{1/3}$ ] is the average distance between clusters . from these expressions",
    "we can find that , for small clusters which have less then thousands or hundreds of baryon numbers , the effect of quantum uncertainty could be larger than that of thermal motion .",
    "this zero - point energy should be much smaller than the depth ( @xmath38 ) of potential well between clusters , @xmath39 , where @xmath6 is in unit of @xmath40 and @xmath41 mev is suggested .",
    "we have @xmath42 if @xmath43 is chosen .",
    "this result means that , for @xmath44 , the bond - energy between clusters must be much higher than @xmath45 ; otherwise the matter should become a quantum fluid . in an other word ,",
    "if the interactions between clusters do exceed much from @xmath45 , then it is natural for quark matter to be solidified even when the clusters have only @xmath46 quarks .    to generate glitches ,",
    "a solid quark star should have shear modulus @xcite @xmath47 .",
    "the shear modulus @xmath17 can be derived from the young s modulus @xmath48 via @xmath49 $ ] , where @xmath50 is called poisson ratio , @xmath51 .",
    "we see @xmath17 and @xmath48 are of a same order of magnitude . for simplicity",
    "we can assume the potential of interaction is linard - jones potential , @xmath52 , and we have then @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "for finding a linear coefficient which cause the hook s law , we extract the taylor expansion near the bottom of the potential well , @xmath55 ^ 2 +    o[r-(\\frac{2b}{a})^{1/6}]^3,\\ ] ] from which we find that the second order term can be written as @xmath56 .",
    "using @xmath57 and @xmath38 to eliminate @xmath58 and @xmath21 , the second order term becomes @xmath59 . at the same time , by considering a cylinder of length @xmath60 and cross section @xmath61 , the number of links between clusters at the direction of length in this volume is @xmath62 ; thus the value of elastic energy can be written as , @xmath63 we can then easily get the young s modulus @xmath64 .",
    "the typical value of shear modulus is @xmath65 in which @xmath66 , consequently , @xmath67 as mentioned before , from observations , we have shear modulus @xmath68 erg/@xmath69 .",
    "the number of quarks per cluster , @xmath3 , has resultantly an upper limit , which is @xmath70 for @xmath71 and @xmath72 for @xmath73 .",
    "we have obtained the upper limits of the quark number per cluster , @xmath3 , from featureless spectra and pulsar glitches .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath3 , @xmath74 , constrained from featureless spectra is @xmath75 for parameters of @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and reasonable bag constants @xmath21 .",
    "the upper limit of @xmath3 for generating pulsar glitches is @xmath72 if bond - energy between clusters is 10mev .",
    "we conclude therefore that the upper limit of quark number per cluster could be @xmath76 in order for bare strange stars to reproduce both featureless x - ray spectra and pulsar glitches .    what have been done in this paper",
    "are based on the solid quark star model .",
    "this model is only a phenomenological model , into which it is very necessary to research from first principles .",
    "nevertheless , the conclusion of our paper may provide helpful information about the detail processes of quark clustering and matter solidifying .",
    "one problem in our paper is that we had used an equation of state derived from the traditional concept of free - quark matter , not clustered - quark matter",
    ". this problem may affect the result significantly if clustering changes the equation of state too much .",
    "although this issue needs to be treated seriously , the deviation of equation of state may be slight , since color - confinement does not occur yet in the quark - clustering matter and the property of the vacuum could thus be not much different from that described by @xcite ."
