    "we will discuss the following consequences of this calculation :    *   the calculation of the final spin given in @xcite contains an implicit reference to the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) of a test particle orbiting the kerr black hole that results from the merger .",

    "the inspiral phase of two compact objects is generally considered to end when the binary has evolved to an innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) , should it exist .",
    "the isco can be defined by waveform models and numerical relativity @xcite .",
    "unfortunately there is a difference in the numbers obtained from different methods .",
    "some ligo searches for non - spinning systems have taken the conservative approach to use the isco defined for a test particle orbiting a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "intuitively the space - time of an inspiralling comparable mass binary system will not be well described by a schwarzschild space - time , and thus the schwarzschild isco will not capture the dynamics correctly . if the merger product is a black hole , it will be a kerr - like black hole with a final spin that is a function of the masses and spins of the components .",
    "recently @xcite has proposed a simple set of assumptions that predict the final spin of the black hole merger product to well within 10% of numerical simulations based on first principle arguments .",
    "implicitly in the derivation of @xcite is the isco radius of a test particle orbiting a kerr black hole having a final spin equal to the spin of the merger product .",
    "the fact that the isco radius used gives the correct answer for the final space - time suggests that it plays an important role in the pre - merger dynamics .",

    "the free fall time scale will under predict the time since the system may still complete some ( unstable ) orbits before merging .",
    "the estimate that agrees best with numerical relativity simulations is the infall time of a test particle falling from a circular orbit just below the isco to the light ring of the the merged kerr black hole .",
    "figure [ tfvolume ] shows the time - frequency volume for the merger epochs as a function of mass ratio for non - spinning binaries .",

    "as mentioned previously , there is ambiguity on how to define when the inspiral phase ends .",
    "however , what is really necessary is the characteristic frequency at which a given template waveform ceases to resemble the numerical simulations .",
    "some searches for low mass binary systems of non - spinning component masses use the isco of a test particle orbiting a schwarzschild black hole @xcite .",
    "other searches use the iscos calculated from explicit pn energy considerations , and some abandon the use of an isco altogether and use the schwarzschild light ring as a termination frequency @xcite .    recall that for low mass ratio ( @xmath26 ) systems of non - spinning objects , the schwarzschild test particle limit is a good approximation for the expected isco frequency since the merger product will be a schwarzschild - like black hole .",
    "however , for systems with comparable masses and/or spin the true isco frequency may be different since the non - trivial contribution from the orbital angular momentum will have a strong impact on the final black hole s spin , and the space - time in the near merger epoch .",

    "most approximants stay faithful through the schwarzschild isco frequency @xcite .",
    "some approximants fare extremely well beyond this point @xcite .",
    "the fact that some approximants do remain faithful far beyond the schwarzschild isco leads us to examine using the isco frequency described in the previous section , equation ( [ eq : bklisco ] ) , as the termination frequency for inspiral data analysis . as shown , this frequency is consistent with some of the pn and eob models for predicting the isco in the equal mass regime ( fig .",
    "[ pn_isco ] ) and is consistent with exact solutions in the test particle limit",
    ". it also has the advantage of being waveform model , or fit , independent ( based on first principles ) and is easy to calculate .",
    "we will conservatively model the impact of possible phase errors incurred by using an approximant that does nt quite match numerical relativity results in our assessment .",
    "we use the stationary phase approximation waveforms , which are often employed in searches , and can be defined as , @xmath27 where @xmath2 is the total mass and @xmath28 is the reduced mass @xcite . in order to ascertain the phase fidelity we turn to comparisons given in @xcite which show for equal mass binary simulations the phase difference between numerical results and 3.5 pn waveforms as a function of frequency .",
    "the figures in @xcite indicate a good fidelity in phase through the schwarzschild isco frequency .",
    "however substantial phase errors may accumulate between the schwarzschild and bkl isco frequencies . in order to accurately predict the impact of integrating pn waveforms to the bkl isco we decided to model the possibility that secular phase errors could be @xmath29 or more radians between the schwarzschild and bkl iscos .",
    "we propose calculating the snr ratio of an ensemble of waveforms where phase errors are allowed to accumulate linearly between the schwarzschild isco @xmath30 and the bkl isco @xmath31 given by , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a normally distributed variable with mean 0 and variance 1 .",

    "since search results are maximized over snr this is an important possibility .",
    "2 ) the phase errors do not accumulate linearly between these frequencies , most of the phase error occurs near the bkl isco . using the \\{@xmath36 } dependent isco frequencies as @xmath31 and the schwarzschild isco frequencies as @xmath37 we plot the expected snr ratio for initial ligo @xcite in figure [ f : snrratiomvsq ] , which shows that for some total mass and mass ratio combinations there is an appreciable gain in snr by integrating to the new isco frequencies despite modeled phase errors .",
    "this calculation is not intended to suggest that spa templates cut at the bkl isco produce the optimal gain in snr , since other approximants or frequency cut offs could do better .",
    "instead , it aims to simply illustrate the effect of integrating to the bkl isco as a function of @xmath2 and @xmath38 for present searches .",
    "the mass range is limited to 80 @xmath39 so that at least two cycles exist in the waveform between 40hz and the schwarzschild isco frequency .     the snr ratio defined by equation ( [ eq : snrratio ] ) for the non - spinning case @xmath40 .",

    "if the bkl isco truly marks the transition from an inspiral , radiation - dominated evolution to a dynamical one then it does have some consquence for the ability to probe the tidal disruption of neutron stars through gravitational waves .",
    "estimation of gravitational - wave frequencies for tidal disruption of ns - bh binaries may be useful for determining various properties of the neutron star , such as the radius @xcite .",
    "knowing the radius of the neutron star would in turn provide information about its equation of state @xcite .",
    "however , as pointed out in @xcite , it would be difficult to extract information about the disruption unless it occurs before the binary reaches the isco .",
    "if the disruption occurs afterwards , its signature in the produced gravitational waves might be too weak for extracting accurate information .",
    "thus , the `` useful '' cases are those for which the tidal - disruption frequency is less than the frequency at the plunge ( @xmath41 )",
    ".    a more accurate calculation of @xmath42 would imply a better estimate of the range of ns - bh binaries for which the disruption is more plausible to be measured . in this section",
    "we show how that range changes when the formalism of section  [ s : formalism ] is applied , as compared to that in @xcite .",
    "the frequencies obtained in @xcite correspond to the extreme mass ratio case , @xmath43 , and non - spinning neutron star , @xmath44 . in figure",
    "[ f : rvsf ] we reproduce those results ( compare to figure  2 of @xcite ) , together with the values obtained using the formalism presented in this work",

    "filled circles correspond to the extreme mass ratio approximation .",
    "the meaningful part of each curve will be that to the left of the white circles ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "the plunge frequencies calculated in @xcite for the case with @xmath51 ( black circles in the right - hand - side curve of figure  [ f : rvsf ] ) correspond to retrograde orbits .",
    "however , for that mass ratio ( @xmath52 ) , the test particle orbiting the merger product isco does so in a prograde fashion due to the orbital angular momentum dominating the final spin .",
    "thus , the final spin is aligned with the orbital angular momentum even though its initial spin is anti - aligned .",
    "we now compare with the nr results obtained in @xcite .",

    "although the models studied in @xcite expand only a small range of parameters ; we see that , at least in that range , the frequencies obtained with the bkl approach are consistent with the nr results ( see figure  7 of @xcite ) - that is they predict in every case a higher value than the measured @xmath56 caused by the tidal effects .",
    ".[t : shibata ] bkl frequencies for the same parameters as models a - f of @xcite .",
    "these values are consistent with the nr results - that is the bkl isco frequency is higher than the observable @xmath56 from the simulations @xcite [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the estimate for the spin of the black hole that results from bh - bh , bh - ns , and some ns - ns mergers found in @xcite leads to an estimate for the isco , light ring , and quasinormal mode ring - down frequencies of a general compact binary system that is waveform model independent .",
    "both frequencies have impact on searches for the inspiral , merger and ring - down epochs of the gravitational waves emitted by these systems .",
    "we have shown that the most interesting merger - epoch time - frequency volumes are for extreme mass ratios .",
    "more work may have to be done to model merger epochs for these systems .",
    "the formalism presented here to describe inspiral , merger and ring - down epochs can be extended to arbitrary spin configurations and may help guide the construction of better analytic models .    as for inspiral epoch searches alone",
    ", we have shown that for symmetric mass , non - spinning systems with greater than 45 @xmath39 total mass there can be a 30% gain in snr over using the schwarzschild isco radius as is done currently @xcite even including conservative phase errors .",
    "it is worth noticing that more general fittings can be computed in order to cover the full range of parameters @xmath57 within the bkl approximation .",
    "additionally we discussed cases where neutron star tidal disruption may be observed more easily through gravitational waves .",
    "we would like to stress that this work is open ended .",

    "<S> improved knowledge about the end of the inspiral phase , the beginning of the merger , and the ring - down frequencies could increase the efficiency of both coherent inspiral - merger - ring - down ( imr ) searches and searches over each phase separately . </S>",
    "<S> insight can be gained for all three cases through a recently presented theoretical calculation , which , corroborated by the numerical results , provides an implicit formula for the final spin of the merged black holes , accurate to within 10% over a large parameter space . </S>",
    "<S> knowledge of the final spin allows one to predict the end of the inspiral phase and the quasinormal mode ring - down frequencies , and in turn provides information about the bandwidth and duration of the merger . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we will discuss a few of the implications of this calculation for data analysis . </S>"
