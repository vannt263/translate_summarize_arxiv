    "in recent years the physical properties of mott ( or charge transfer ) insulators are in the focus of interest in the condensed matter theory @xcite . in order to develop theoretical understanding of complex phenomena in doped correlated insulators , including high temperature superconductivity in the cuprates and the colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) in the manganites",
    ", it is necessary to describe first the undoped materials , such as la@xmath6cuo@xmath7 and lamno@xmath1 . in both cases the local coulomb interactions ( hubbard @xmath8 ) is large and suppresses charge fluctuations , leading to low - energy effective hamiltonians with superexchange interactions which stabilize antiferromagnetic ( af ) spin order at low temperature @xcite .",
    "however , these two compounds are qualitatively quite different . on the one hand ,",
    "the degeneracy of partly filled @xmath9 orbitals is lifted in la@xmath6cuo@xmath7 by the tetragonal distortions of cuo@xmath10 octahedra , resulting in two - dimensional ( 2d ) af superexchange of @xmath11 holes in @xmath12 orbitals of cu@xmath13 ions . on the other hand , in lamno@xmath1 @xmath9",
    "orbital degeneracy plays a fundamental role and , together with the jahn - teller ( jt ) distortions , is required to understand the origin of the anisotropic @xmath14-type af ( @xmath14-af ) order @xcite . as realized already three decades ago @xcite ,",
    "in this latter case the orbital degrees of freedom , which are described by the components @xmath15 of pseudospin @xmath16 and contribute explicitly to the structure of the superexchange .",
    "thus they have to be included on equal footing with ionic spins in a spin - orbital superexchange model . in the last two decades",
    "several new concepts were developed , such as enhanced quantum fluctuations due to orbital degrees of freedom which participate in joint spin - orbital excitations @xcite , and spin - orbital entanglement which occurs in cases when spin and orbital operators can not be decoupled from each other @xcite .",
    "the actual physical problems in this emerging and rapidly developing field were reviewed in the focus issue _ orbital physics _ in new journal of physics @xcite a few years ago .",
    "here we want to focus on a few representative recent developments in the field of spin - orbital physics .",
    "before we will discuss a few consequences of realistic spin - orbital models , let us consider first purely orbital superexchange interactions , as realized in ferromagnetic ( fm ) 2d systems , such as k@xmath6cuf@xmath7 , or in fm @xmath17 planes of three - dimensional ( 3d ) perovskites , either in kcuf@xmath1 or in lamno@xmath1 .",
    "the superexchange originates from charge @xmath18 excitations ( with @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) in the first case ( for cu@xmath13 ions ) , and from @xmath21 ( with @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 ) excitations in the second one ( for mn@xmath25 ions ) @xcite .",
    "these charge excitations can be transformed away by applying a similar canonical transformation to the one leading to the @xmath26-@xmath27 model @xcite , commonly used to describe the superconducting cuprates .",
    "for the fm compound only high - spin excited states contribute , and in the strong - coupling regime ( @xmath28 ) one obtains the effective low - energy hamiltonian describing orbital superexchange between pseudospins @xmath16 due to @xmath9 electrons ( holes in kcuf@xmath1 ) in a cubic crystal @xcite , @xmath29 the first term @xmath30 in eq .",
    "( [ orbis ] ) describes superexchange interaction which depends on the superexchange constant @xmath31 [ here @xmath26 is the @xmath32 hopping element between two @xmath33 orbitals along the @xmath34 axis , and @xmath8 is the intraorbital coulomb interaction ] , and on hund s exchange element @xmath35 this interaction parametrizes the multiplet structure of transition metal ions when anisotropy of coulomb and exchange elements is neglected @xcite . in the simplest case of @xmath36 system ,",
    "the singlet - triplet splitting between the two lowest @xmath37 excited states is @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we will consider below a 3d ( perovskite ) system with fm spin order and orbital interactions described by the hamiltonian ( [ orbis ] ) .",
    "the origin of intrinsic frustration in the orbital superexchange is best realized by considering its form  @xmath39 where @xmath40 refers to the cubic axes , and @xmath41 follows from the energy of the high - spin charge excitation @xcite .",
    "the pseudospin operators are defined as follows , @xmath42 where @xmath43 are pauli matrices and sign @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) is selected for a bond @xmath46 along @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) axis .",
    "the pseudospin interactions @xmath49 favor alternating orbitals ( aos ) on each bond .",
    "they are fundamentally different from the su(2)-symmetric spin interactions , as they : ( @xmath50 ) obey only lower cubic symmetry , ( @xmath51 ) are ising - like , having only one component of the pseudospin interaction which favors pairs of orbitals oriented along the bond ( @xmath52-like ) and in the plane perpendicular to the bond ( @xmath53-like ) , and ( @xmath54 ) change their form when the cubic direction is changed .",
    "the interactions ( [ hj0 ] ) look to be classical , but in fact due to the form of of the pseudospin @xmath9 operators ( [ eg ] ) they are not .",
    "however , the quantum corrections generated by them are rather small @xcite .",
    "the second term @xmath55 in eq .",
    "( [ orbis ] ) stands for the orbital splitting ( by @xmath56 ) , and follows from finite crystal field at either cu@xmath13 or mn@xmath25 ions , @xmath57 the crystal - field splitting favors electron ( hole ) occupancy in @xmath53 ( @xmath52 ) orbital for @xmath58 or ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "this term is induced by static distortions in the tetragonal field and is of particular importance in 2d systems , e.g. in the high-@xmath60 cuprates .",
    "the directional nature of pseudospin orbital interactions is responsible for their intrinsic frustration @xcite .",
    "in fact , the pair of orbitals which would minimize the energy for a bond @xmath46 is different for each cubic axis .",
    "therefore , while for a single bond the minimal energy of @xmath61 can easily be obtained by selecting a pair of orthogonal orbitals on both sites , such as @xmath33 and @xmath62 orbital for a bond along the @xmath34 axis ( note that this corresponds to the ising superexchange interaction as only one orbital is active in intersite charge excitations ) , this is no longer possible for a 2d ( or 3d ) system .",
    "thus , unlike in spin systems , the tendency towards disorder ( quantum _ orbital liquid _ ) is enhanced with increasing system dimension @xcite .",
    "the essence of orbital frustration which characterizes the @xmath9 orbital superexchange ( [ hj0 ] ) is captured by the 2d compass model , originally developed as a model for mott insulators @xcite .",
    "intersite interactions in the compass model are descibed by products @xmath63 of pseudospin components , where @xmath64 , rather than by a scalar product @xmath65 .",
    "@xmath66 where @xmath64 , rather than by a scalar product @xmath65 . in the 2d case",
    "the @xmath67 interactions for bonds @xmath46 along the @xmath47 axis compete with the @xmath68 ones along the @xmath48 axis @xcite .",
    "recently certain aspects of this model were investigated by analytic @xcite and numerical @xcite methods . despite its closeness to ordinary models used in quantum magnetism , there is no ordered phase with finite magnetization .",
    "thus , this case is qualitatively different from the frustrated ising interactions on the 2d square lattice , where it was proven rigorously that magnetic order develops below certain transition temperature which depends on the ratio of frustrated to nonfrustrated plaquettes @xcite .",
    "a competition of pseudospin interactions along different directions results instead in intersite correlations similar to the anisotropic xy model , and competition between two types of ising - like order generates a quantum phase transition with high degeneracy of the ground state when all interactions have the same strength @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that a similar quantum phase transition exists also in the one - dimensional ( 1d ) compass model @xcite , when both above interactions alternate along the chain ( @xmath69 is the number of unit cells ) : @xmath70 this model was solved exactly in the whole range of @xmath71 parameters @xcite by maping to the exactly solvable quantum ising model @xcite in different subspaces ( see also this volume @xcite )",
    ". equal coupling constants @xmath72 correspond to the the quantum critical point , where the orbital liquid emerges from two different disordered phases , with hidden order of pairs of pseudospins on every second bond .",
    "presented here 1d model model ( [ h1 ] ) provides thus a beautiful example of a first order quantum phase transition .",
    "the structure of spin - orbital superexchange involves interactions between su(2)-symmetric spin scalar products @xmath73 on each bond @xmath46 connecting two nearest - neighbor transition metal ions , each one coupled to orbital operators @xmath74 which obey only much lower symmetry ( at most cubic for a cubic lattice ) and its general form is @xcite , @xmath75 the orbital operators @xmath76 and @xmath77 involve the active orbitals on each bond @xmath78 along direction @xmath79 , either @xmath80 or @xmath81 , which participate in @xmath82 virtual excitations , and thus have the symmetry of the lattice ( _ e.g. _  cubic in the perovskites ) . the superexchange model ( [ som ] )",
    "consists of several terms which originate from different charge excitations .",
    "this feature made it possible to relate the averages of these different excitations to the spectral weights in the optical spectroscopy @xcite , and this serves now as a theoretical tool to explain the observed anisotropy and temperature dependence of the spectral weights in the optical spectra @xcite .",
    "the best known spin - orbital model is the kugel - khomskii model for @xmath36 cu@xmath13 ions which involves the @xmath9 orbital operators ( [ eg ] ) and includes both fm and af spin interactions , depending on whether the above charge excitation ( for @xmath83 ) involves the high - spin ( triplet ) or one of the low - spin ( singlet ) @xmath37 states .",
    "these excitations are parametrized by the coefficients @xmath41 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",

    "( [ som ] ) , @xmath87 this procedure assumes implicitly that spin and orbital operators can be decoupled from each other and ignores the possibility of entanglement and composite spin - orbital excitations introduced in ref .",
    "it turns out that such excitations play a prominent role in destabilizing the classical af long - range order in the @xmath36 spin - orbital model @xcite .",
    "qualitatively , the classical phase diagram of model ( [ som9 ] ) including the crystal - field term ( [ hz ] ) consists in the @xmath88 plane of four af phases shown schematically in fig .",
    "1 . first ,",
    "if @xmath89 is small , then : ( @xmath50 ) if @xmath58 , the order is af and the holes occupy @xmath62 orbitals ( 2d afx phase ) , while ( @xmath51 ) for @xmath59  @xmath33 orbitals are occupied in the anisotropic 3d afz phase .",
    "second , if @xmath90 is large the high - spin excitations become important for the bonds with different orbitals on both sites , and weak fm interactions ( @xmath91 ) occur within the @xmath17 planes , accompanied by strong ( @xmath92 ) af interactions along the @xmath34-axis , leading to @xmath14-af phase . depending on the actual value of @xmath93 , either ( @xmath54 ) @xmath14-af1 phase , or ( @xmath94 ) @xmath14-af2 phase [ with af @xmath95 planes and fm bonds along the @xmath47 axis ]",
    "is stable on the classical level .",
    "the energies of all the classical phases are degenerate at the @xmath96 point .",
    "the competition between the above types of spin and orbital order leads here to the quantum critical point at @xmath96 .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that , similar to the situation in frustrated @xmath97-@xmath98-@xmath99 spin models in quantum magnetism where the quantum corrections obtained from the spin - wave theory diverge and suppress the long - range order near quantum critical points @xcite , the spin order in all the @xmath100-af and @xmath14-af phases is suppressed near the @xmath101 point .",
    "although couterarguments were also given that the af@xmath52 ( but not af@xmath53 ! ) phase could be stabilized by order - out - of - disorder mechanism @xcite and this controversial issue awaits still an answer with a more sophisticated treatment , it is believed that only short - range order with correlations of valence - bond ( vb ) type may survive near the transitions between different phases with classical order ( fig .",
    "1 ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite a few representative variational vb wave functions ( see fig .",
    "2 ) were constructed , with spin singlets on individual bonds @xmath102 accompanied by the variationally optimized orbitals pointing predominantly along the bond .",
    "each vb phase is characterized by a set @xmath103 which defines the bonds @xmath102 occupied by spin singlets , covering the 3d lattice .",
    "the two simplest ( dimer ) vb states are ( see fig .",
    "2 ) : ( @xmath50 ) singlets along the @xmath47 axis with orbitals close to @xmath104 ( vb@xmath47 phase , degenerate with the analogous vb@xmath48 phase ) , ( @xmath51 ) singlets along the @xmath34-axis with @xmath33 orbitals ( vb@xmath34 ) , are indeed more stable than the above classical af phases , and we emphasize that this happens in three dimensions .    further improvement of the energy might be expected by including leading quantum fluctuations in the vb ( vb@xmath47 and vb@xmath34 ) states . in case of the vb@xmath47 phase",
    "this would lead to resonance on each plaquette between the two components composed of spin singlets along the @xmath47 and @xmath48 axis , respectively , but this is hindered by the optimized @xmath52-like orbitals , oriented in these states either along the @xmath47 , or along the @xmath48 axis ( therefore the overlap between these two configurations is severly reduced ) .",
    "unlike in the heisenberg antiferromagnet , the bonds not occupied by singlets _ contribute finite energy _ due to the orbital terms similar to those in sec .",
    "i , and it turns out to be better to optimize the orbital energies due to those bonds depending on whether the bond connects two singlets : either ( @xmath50 ) along a single ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 , or @xmath34 ) axis , or ( @xmath51 ) oriented along two different axes with an angle of @xmath105 , or ( @xmath54 ) parallel to each other , with the bond making itself an angle of @xmath105 to both of them . as the second type of non - singlet bond is energetically the most favorable one , more energy is gained if plaquettes occupied by singlets along @xmath47 and @xmath48 axis alternate and form a 3d superlattice , a plaquette vb alternating ( pvba ) state ( fig .",
    "2 ) , giving a lower energy that the quantum - corrected @xmath14-af phase .",
    "in contrast , the energy of the vb@xmath34 phase is decreased more by the resonance between the vertical singlets ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "the energy of the resulting resonating vb@xmath34 ( rvb@xmath34 ) state could be obtained using the bethe ansatz result for the 1d heisenberg antiferromagnet , and adding the orbital energies due to the bonds @xmath107 .",
    "furthermore , a pvb interlayered phase along the @xmath34 axis ( pvbi@xmath34 ) , composed of single planes of the pvba phase interlayered with two planes of vb@xmath34 vertical singlets ( fig .",
    "2 ) , is more stable in the crossover regime between the rvb@xmath34 and pvba phases for @xmath108 .",
    "the orbital energies @xmath92 in the bonds which connect the singlets on the bonds along the @xmath34 axis with those lying in the @xmath17 planes are then optimized , while the energies @xmath109 are gained in the double layers of vb@xmath34 phase . for @xmath110 ,",
    "a rotated interlayered phase ( pvbi@xmath47 ) is more stable before the pvba takes over .",
    "altogether , one finds @xcite that an exotic spin - orbital liquid state , represented here by rvb@xmath34 , pvbi@xmath34 , pvbi@xmath47 and pvba phases , is favored in an extended regime of parameters , in analogy with a 2d 1/5-depleted lattice @xcite , but the present instability is stronger and happens in a 3d model .",
    "finally , we remark that the present @xmath36 model ( [ som9 ] ) applies also to @xmath111 low - spin ni@xmath25 ions in linio@xmath6 via a particle - hole transformation . however , the situation is rather complex there and also other models were proposed .",
    "first , it was argued that a model based on symmetry arguments @xcite , characterized by a large number of low - lying singlets associated to dimer coverings of the triangular lattice , could explain the properties of linio@xmath6 .",
    "second , it was shown that charge - transfer terms contribute to the superexchange and they change the balance between different terms in the hamiltonian , making the orbital interactions stronger than the spin ones @xcite . in any case",
    ", interplane jt interplane coupling seems to be too weak in linio@xmath6 to stabilize the orbital long - range order .",
    "the observed difference in the physical properties between nanio@xmath6 and linio@xmath6 remains one of the puzzling phenomena in the field @xcite and awaits a future study which has to include all the above aspects .",
    "future developments in the theory to understand better the nature of ordered and disordered states in spin - orbital systems have to take into account possible entanglement between both spin and orbital degrees of freedom on the bonds , as for instance in the states of fig .",
    "2 . it is a common wisdom that the magnetism of correlated mott insulators can be understood by means of the goodenough - kanamori rules .",
    "they originate from the mean - field ( mf ) picture and predict that the superexchange interaction between two magnetic ions with degenerate orbitals is strongly af because of the pauli principle if the overlap between the occupied orbitals is large , whereas it is weakly fm when the overlap is weak or virtually disappears .",
    "this means that spin order and orbital order are complementary  ferro orbital ( fo ) order supports af order , while ao order supports fm spin order . indeed , these celebrated rules are well followed in the manganites @xcite , where the ao is robust in the fm @xmath17 planes , while the orbitals obey the fo order along the @xmath34 axis , supporting the af coupling and leading to the @xmath14-af phase .",
    "in fact , one may use here the mf decoupling of the spin and orbital operators , which is sufficient to explain both the magnetic and optical properties of lamno@xmath1 @xcite . the orbital order ( or liquid )",
    "state determines as well whether the intersite spin correlations are af or fm in monolayer @xcite and in bilayer @xcite manganites , while in the perovskite la@xmath112sr@xmath113mno@xmath1 systems the magnons in the fm metallic phase are well explained by the orbital liquid state @xcite .    as a prominent example of the goodenough - kanamori complementarity we would like to mention also the af phases realized in yvo@xmath1 @xcite , which are the subject of intense research in recent years .",
    "while @xmath114 orbitals of v@xmath25 ions are occupied due to gdfeo@xmath1 distortions , the second electron of the @xmath115 ionic configuration may occupy either @xmath116 or @xmath117 orbital . depending on whether these orbitals follow fo or ao order along the @xmath34 axis , the magnetic correlations are there either af or fm , explaining the origin of the two observed types of af order shown in fig . 3 : ( @xmath50 ) the @xmath118-af phase , and ( @xmath51 ) the @xmath100-af phase ( with af spin order along all three cubic directions ) .",
    "= 5.5 cm    one may verify the goodenough - kanamori rules by evaluating intersite spin and orbital correlations , @xmath119 and comparing them with each other .",
    "in addition , spin - orbital entanglement can be measured by the composite correlation function defined for a bond @xmath46 @xcite , @xmath120 when @xmath121 , the spin and orbital operators are disentangled and their mf decoupling can be applied , while if @xmath122  spin and orbital operators are entangled .",
    "consider again the structure of spin - orbital superexchange models ( [ som ] ) derived for @xmath81 systems from charge excitations between transition metal ions in configurations : @xmath123 ( ti@xmath25 ions in cubic titanates ) with @xmath11 @xcite , and @xmath115 ( v@xmath25 ions in cubic vanadates ) with @xmath124 @xcite , for more details about the structure of @xmath125 in both @xmath123 and @xmath123 model see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    to capture the essence of spin - orbital entanglement",
    "it is sufficient to solve @xmath81 models for @xmath123 and @xmath115 configurations on four - site chains oriented along the @xmath34 axis using periodic boundary conditions .",
    "one finds entangled spin - orbital states in both models , and nontrivial spin - orbital dynamics strongly influences both intersite spin and orbital intersite correlations ( [ sij ] ) . in the @xmath123 ( titanate )",
    "case one recovers the su(4 ) model with @xmath126 at @xmath127 [ fig .",
    "4(a ) ] . at finite @xmath89 the su(4 ) degeneracy of all intersite correlations is removed and @xmath128 , as long as the spin singlet ( @xmath129 ) ground state persists , i.e. , for @xmath130 .",
    "in this regime the goodenough - kanamori rule with complementary correlations ( implying different signs of @xmath131 and @xmath132 ) , is violated .",
    "instead , by analyzing the values of the intersite correlations one finds that the ground state wave function for each bond @xmath46 is close to a total spin - orbital singlet , involving a linear combination of ( spin singlet / orbital triplet ) and ( spin triplet / orbital singlet ) states .",
    "the vanadate @xmath115 model behaves in a similar way , with all three @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath133 correlations being negative in the spin - singlet ( @xmath129 ) regime of fluctuating @xmath116 and @xmath117 orbitals obtained for @xmath134 [ fig .",
    "4(b ) ] . therefore , the composite spin - orbital correlations are here finite ( @xmath122 ) , spin and orbital variables are _ entangled _ , and the mf factorization of the ground state fails .    to provide further evidence that the goodenough - kanamori rules do not apply to @xmath81 systems in the regime of small @xmath89 , we compare spin exchange constants @xmath135 ( [ jij ] ) with the actual values of intersite spin correlations @xmath131 ( [ sij ] ) .",
    "one finds that exchange interaction is formally fm ( @xmath136 ) in the orbital - disordered phase at low values of @xmath89 [ figs .",
    "[ fig : enta](c ) and [ fig : enta](d ) ] is in fact accompanied by af spin correlations ( @xmath137 ) , so @xmath138 and the ground state energy calculated in the mf theory is _ enhanced _ @xcite . in contrast , similar analysis ( not shown ) performed for spin - orbital model ( [ som9 ] ) , derived for @xmath36 ions with @xmath9 orbital degrees of freedom , gave @xmath139 , so here spin correlations follow the sign of the exchange constant @xcite .",
    "this remarkable difference between @xmath81 and @xmath9 systems originates from composite spin - orbital fluctuations , which are responsible for the _ ` dynamical ' _ nature of exchange constants in the former case .",
    "they exhibit large fluctuations around the average value , measured by @xmath140 .",
    "as an illustrative example , we give here the values found in the @xmath123 and @xmath115 model at @xmath127 .",
    "while the average spin exchange constant is small in both cases ( @xmath141 for @xmath123 , @xmath142 for @xmath115 ) , @xmath143 fluctuates widely over both positive and negative values . in the @xmath123 case",
    "the fluctuations between ( @xmath129/@xmath144 ) and ( @xmath124/@xmath145 ) bond wave functions are so large that @xmath146 !",
    "they survive even quite far from the high - symmetry su(4 ) point ( at @xmath147 ) , and stabilize spin - orbital singlet phase in a broad regime of @xmath89 . also in the @xmath115 model the orbital bond correlations change dynamically from singlet to triplet , resulting in @xmath148 , with @xmath149 , while these fluctuations are small for @xmath36 model ( [ som9 ] ) with @xmath9 orbitals .",
    "we emphasize that composite spin - orbital fluctuations which occur in spin - orbital entangled states for realistic parameters determine the magnetic and optical properties of titanates and vanadates .",
    "for instance , such composite spin - orbital fluctuations are responsible for the temperature dependence of the optical spectral weights in lavo@xmath1 @xcite and trigger spin - orbital dimerization in the @xmath118-af phase of yvo@xmath1 in the intermediate temperature regime ( see below ) @xcite . remarkably , the observed dimerization in the magnetic excitations may be sees as a signature of entanglement in excited states which become relevant at finite temperature .",
    "it is activated by thermal fluctuations in the spin chain @xcite , which couple to dimerized correlations in the orbital sector .",
    "recent progress in experimental studies of transition metal oxides provided exceptionally detailed information on the phase diagrams of the @xmath0mno@xmath1 manganites @xcite and the @xmath0vo@xmath1 vanadates @xcite ( where @xmath0=la , pr,@xmath2,lu ) . in the manganites",
    "the orbital order appears first when the temperature is lowered ( at @xmath150 k ) , and its onset is accompanied by a lattice distortion .",
    "the magnetic order follows at much lower temperature @xmath151 k. this separation of the spin and orbital energy scales follows also from the jt distortions which contribute to the orbital interactions and enhance the value of @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "recent experiments showed that the orbital transition temperature @xmath3 is enhanced when the ionic radius @xmath5 of the @xmath152 ions decreases along the @xmath0mno@xmath1 perovskites , while @xmath153 is drastically reduced , resulting in the change of magnetic order from the @xmath14-af to the @xmath154-af phase @xcite .",
    "this behavior could not be understood until now and is one of the challenges for the theory .",
    "the experimental situation in the cubic vanadates is different and even more complex . on the one hand ,",
    "the magnetic order in yvo@xmath1 is @xmath100-af [ fig .",
    "[ fig : rvo](b ) ] at low temperature , and changes at the first order magnetic transition at @xmath155 k to the @xmath118-af structure , which remains stable up to @xmath156 k. the magnetic transition at @xmath157 is particularly surprising as the staggered moments change their direction from approximately parallel to the @xmath34 axis in the @xmath100-af phase to lying almost within the @xmath17 planes in the @xmath118-af phase , with some small alternating @xmath100-af component @xcite .",
    "although it was argued that the entropy due to magnetic and orbital excitations is higher in the @xmath118-af phase @xcite , the magnetization reversal at the lower magnetic transition remains misterious , and this phenomenon is still puzzling and far from being completely understood . on the other hand , only the @xmath118af order develops in lavo@xmath1 below a somewhat higher @xmath158 k , and is almost immediately followed by a weak structural transition stabilizing the weak @xmath100ao order at @xmath159 k @xcite [ fig .",
    "[ fig : rvo](a ) ] .",
    "remarkably , the magnetic order parameter in the @xmath118-af phase of lavo@xmath1 is strongly reduced to @xmath160 , much below the reduction expected from quantum fluctuations in the @xmath118-af phase ( being only 6% for @xmath124 spins ) @xcite  also this reduction of the measured magnetization could not be explained so far .",
    "experimental studies have shown that the @xmath118-af order is common to the entire family of the @xmath0vo@xmath1 vanadates , and in general @xmath161 , except for lavo@xmath1 with @xmath162 @xcite .",
    "when the ionic radius @xmath5 decreases , the nel temperature @xmath4 also decreases , while orbital transition temperature @xmath3 increases , passes through a maximum close to yvo@xmath1 , and decreases again towards luvo@xmath1 .",
