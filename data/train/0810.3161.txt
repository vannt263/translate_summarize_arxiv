    "at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) top quark pairs ( @xmath0 ) will be produced copiously .",
    "the next - to - leading order cross section at lhc energies has been estimated to be 833 pb  @xcite . due to this large cross section , at fairly low integrated luminosities ranging from approximately 10 @xmath1 to 100 @xmath1 of lhc data , a top quark signal could be established and the first top quark pair production cross section measurements could be performed .",
    "more details are provided in section 2 .",
    "in addition , top quark events can be used for the calibration of residual jet energy scale corrections , as it is presented in section 3 , or b - jet identification efficiencies  @xcite .    for all samples used in the different studies presented here",
    "@xmath2 collisions were generated at @xmath3 tev . in order to mimic the realistic conditions during the early data taking ,",
    "effects due to tracker misalignment and calorimeter miscalibration were taken into account in the reconstruction .",
    "the effect of multiple proton - proton interactions was not included .",
    "for the different analysis reviewed in this section the event selection strategy is based on a sequential cut procedure based on robust variables . among them ,",
    "lepton and jet transverse momentum or energy , lepton isolation variables , electron identification related variables , or missing transverse energy .",
    "all relevant backgrounds , except the single top production have been taken into account .",
    "different sources of systematic errors have been considered , including those associated to lepton energy scale , trigger efficiencies , jet reconstruction and energy scale , missing transverse energy , parton distribution functions and background cross sections .",
    "the observability and cross section measurements of the @xmath0 production are reviewed in the following subsections for different possible final states of the @xmath0 decay .",
    "the semileptonic muon channel , the dilepton channel and the @xmath4 and @xmath5 channels are considered in sections 2.2 , 2.3 and 2.4 respectively .",
    "more details are provided in  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "a simple and robust event selection was developed , requesting exactly one tightly isolated muon with @xmath6 gev and at least four jets with @xmath7 gev for the leading jet and @xmath8 gev for the other jets . for 10 @xmath1 of integrated luminosity ,",
    "128 signal events are expected , corresponding to a selection efficiency of 10.3@xmath9 , together with 25 other @xmath0 final state events , as well as 45 ( 7 ) w+jets ( z+jets ) events .",
    "the number of qcd background events is determined as 11 with a large uncertainty .",
    "figure  [ semifig ] shows the jet multiplicity distribution for events passing the final selection except the requirement of @xmath10 and the invariant mass of the three jets with the highest vectorially summed @xmath11 for the final selection .          a clear signal stands out in the first 10 @xmath1 of cms data in events selected with two high momentum leptons , missing transverse energy , and at least two jets with expected signal - to - noise ratio of 7 to 1 in all events combined and 25 to 1 in electron - muon final state alone .",
    "the most important background comes from z+jets events . for an integrated luminosity of 100 @xmath1 the detector",
    "is assumed to be calibrated and aligned with an amount of data corresponding to 10 @xmath1 .",
    "an additional cut on a robust b - jet identification discriminator based on a track counting algorithm leads to an almost background free event selection where about 160 signal events are expected . for this scenario",
    "the cross - section can be extracted by means of a robust event counting method and the associated statistical uncertainty is found to be @xmath12 .",
    "figure  [ dilfig ] shows the expected number of dilepton events in the first 10 @xmath1 passing the final selection except the requirement of @xmath13 and the missing transverse energy for the final selected events in @xmath14 channel for a total integrated luminosity of 100 @xmath1 .          for this study taus",
    "are defined as tracks approximately collinear with a jet @xmath15 and isolated of other tracks in the cone @xmath16 . using an event selection strategy similar to the ones described in 2.2 or 2.3 , approximately 86 events are found in a simulated event sample corresponding to the first 100 @xmath1 of integrated luminosity .",
    "a signal - to - background ratio @xmath17 is found for 1-prong tau decays , where the most important background comes from the w+jets events .",
    "a least - square kinematic fit using lagrange multipliers can be applied to enforce the mass constraint in the reconstructed @xmath18 events .",
    "both the w boson mass and the top quark mass in the hadronic top quark decay , @xmath19 , are constrained to agree with their measured values .",
    "residual corrections are estimated on the energy scale of the jets arising from both the light quarks in the w boson decay and the heavier bottom quark in the top quark decay . utilizing the first integrated luminosity of 100 @xmath1 of cms data , an uncertainty smaller than 1@xmath9 can be obtained on the jet energy scale for both light and heavy jets .",
    "more details can be found in  @xcite",
    "observability of top quark signal for different final states of @xmath0 production has been presented .",
    "it has been shown that the top quark signature can be established with the first 10 @xmath1 in both the semileptonic muon channel , where about 128 signal events are expected with a signal - to - noise ratio of about 1.5 , and in the dilepton channel , where about 80 signal events are expected in the 3 possible final states with a combined signal - to - noise ratio of 7 to 1 .",
    "in addition the semileptonic muon channel final state can be used to obtain the jet energy scale corrections for both light and heavy jets with an uncertainty smaller than 1@xmath9 for an integrated luminosity of 100 @xmath1 ."
