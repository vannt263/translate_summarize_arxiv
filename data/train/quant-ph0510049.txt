    "the conventional energy eigenvalues become degenerate but the degeneracy is lifted if one diagonalizes the geometric terms .",
    "our analysis shows that the topological interpretation@xcite of geometric phases such as the topological proof of the longuet - higgins phase - change rule@xcite fails in the practical born - oppenheimer approximation where @xmath0 is identified with the period of the slower system .",

    "also , the difference between gauge symmetries for adiabatic phase and `` non - adiabatic phase '' by aharonov - anandan@xcite becomes quite clear in this formulation .",
    "we start with the generic hermitian hamiltonian @xmath1 for a single particle theory in a slowly varying background variable @xmath2 .",

    "the second term is defined by @xmath9    in the operator formulation of the second quantized theory , we thus obtain the effective hamiltonian @xmath10    when we define the schrdinger picture @xmath11 by replacing all @xmath12 in @xmath13 we can show@xcite @xmath14 both - hand sides of this formula are exact , but the difference is that the geometric terms , both of diagonal and off - diagonal , are explicit in the second quantized formulation on the right - hand side .",
    "the state vectors in the second quantization are defined by @xmath15 , and the state vectors in the first quantized states by ( 2 ) .",
    "if one retains only the diagonal elements in this formula ( 7 ) , one recovers the conventional adiabatic formula@xcite @xmath16\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the above formula ( 7 ) represents the essence of geometric phases : if one performs an exact evaluation one does not obtain a clear physical picture of what is going on . on the other hand , if one makes an adiabatic approximation one obtains a clear universal picture .",
    "the path integral formula ( 4 ) is based on the expansion ( 3 ) , and the starting theory depends only on the field variable @xmath17 , not on @xmath18 and @xmath19 separately .",
    "this fact shows that our formulation contains a hidden local gauge symmetry @xmath20 where the gauge parameter @xmath21 is a general function of @xmath22 . by using this gauge freedom",
    ", one can choose the phase convention of the basis set @xmath19 at one s will such that the analysis of geometric phases becomes simplest .",

    "for a simplified two - level problem , the hamiltonian is defined by the matrix in the neighborhood of level crossing  @xcite @xmath25 after a suitable re - definition of the parameters by taking linear combinations of @xmath26 . here",
    "@xmath27 stands for the background variable and @xmath28 for the pauli matrices , and @xmath29 is a suitable ( positive ) coupling constant .",
    "the eigenfunctions in the present case are given by @xmath30 by using the polar coordinates , @xmath31 .",
    "note that , by using hidden local symmetry , our eigenfunctions are chosen to be periodic under a @xmath32 rotation around 3-axis , which is quite different from a @xmath32 rotation of a spin-1/2 wave function . if one defines @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 run over @xmath36 , we have @xmath37    the effective hamiltonian ( 6 ) is then given by @xmath38 with @xmath39 .",
    "the point @xmath40 corresponds to the level crossing . in the adiabatic approximation ,",
    "one neglects the off - diagonal terms in the last geometric terms , which is justified for @xmath41 , where @xmath42 stands for the magnitude of the geometric term times @xmath0 . the adiabatic formula ( 8) then gives the familiar result @xmath43 \\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for a @xmath32 rotation in @xmath44 with fixed @xmath45 , for example .    , whereas the path 2 gives a trivial geometric phase for a fixed finite @xmath0 .",

    ", we can choose in the infinitesimal neighborhood of level crossing @xmath53 . in this new basis",
    ", the geometric phase appears only for the mode @xmath54 which gives rise to a phase factor @xmath55 and thus no physical effects . in the infinitesimal neighborhood of level crossing ,",
    "the states spanned by @xmath56 are transformed to a linear combination of the states spanned by @xmath57 , which give no non - trivial geometric phase .",
    "we emphasize that this topological property is quite different from the familiar aharonov - bohm effect  @xcite , which is topologically exact for any finite time interval @xmath0 .",
    "besides , the setting of the aharonov - bohm effect differs from the present level crossing problem in the fact that the space is not simply connected in the case of the aharonov - bohm effect .",
    "we comment that the non - adiabatic phase by aharonov and anandan  @xcite is based on the equivalence class ( or gauge symmetry ) which identifies all the schrdinger amplitudes of the form @xmath58 this gauge symmetry is quite different from our hidden local symmetry which is related to an arbitrariness of the choice of coordinates in the functional space .",
    "the notion of berry s phase is known to be useful in various physical contexts@xcite .",
    "our analysis however shows that the topological interpretation of berry s phase associated with level crossing generally fails in the practical born - oppenheimer approximation where @xmath0 is identified with the period of the slower system .",
    "the notion of `` approximate topology '' has no rigorous meaning , and it is important to keep this approximate topological property of geometric phases associated with level crossing in mind when one applies the notion of geometric phases to concrete physical processes .",
