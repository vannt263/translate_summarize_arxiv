    "in 1992 , a numerical investigation of the equation of state ( eos ) of the st2 model  @xcite in the supercooled region suggested the possibility of a liquid - liquid ( ll ) critical point in water  @xcite . this initial study has subsequently generated a large amount of numerical and experimental work  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the conceptual novelty of a one - component system with more than one liquid phase , the existence of the associated ll critical point can also rationalize many of the thermodynamic anomalies which characterize liquid water ( e.g. the density maximum and compressibility minimum ) , and which become more pronounced in the supercooled regime .",
    "furthermore , the existence of two distinct liquid phases of supercooled water can explain the polyamorphism which characterizes the glassy phase  @xcite .",
    "indeed , simulations suggest that the low density amorphous solid form of water is similar to the structure of the low density liquid ( ldl ) phase , while the relaxed very - high density amorphous solid is related to the high density liquid ( hdl)@xcite .",
    "evidence in support of a liquid - liquid critical point in water , and in other liquids with tetrahedral structure , has increased over time .",
    "a number of classical models for water , including the recently developed and optimized tip4p/2005  @xcite , exhibit a van  der  waals inflection in their eos at low temperature @xmath0 that is evidence of phase coexistence between two liquid states  @xcite .",
    "the occurrence of a ll transition has also been proposed for silica  @xcite , and more recently , evidence for a ll critical point and its associated thermodynamic anomalies have been presented for the stillinger - weber model of silicon  @xcite .    indeed , it is notable that the most compelling evidence for ll critical points has been generated _ in silico _  @xcite . in almost all cases ,",
    "ll critical points are predicted to occur in deeply supercooled liquids , where crystallization ( in experiments ) has so far prevented direct observation of such phenomenon in bulk systems .",
    "compared to experiments , ll phase transitions are more readily observed in numerical studies because heterogeneous nucleation is not a factor , and the small system size ( usually less than one thousand molecules ) decreases the probability of observing the appearance of a critical crystal nucleus in the simulation box on the time scale of typical simulations .",
    "computer simulations have thus allowed the study of the liquid eos under deeply supercooled conditions , on time scales longer than the structural relaxation time of the liquid but smaller than the homogenous nucleation time . under these conditions ,",
    "equilibrium within the metastable basin of the liquid free energy surface can be achieved without interference from crystal nucleation processes .",
    "nonetheless , evaluations of the eos via simulations in the canonical ensemble , or at constant pressure , do not provide a way to accurately estimate the location of the ll critical point found in water models , or to determine its universality class . only recently , in 2009 , liu , et al .",
    "@xcite reported the first numerical investigation of st2 water in the ll critical region , performing simulations in the grand canonical ensemble for different values of @xmath0 and of the chemical potential @xmath1 , and implementing ewald sums to account for the long - range contributions to the electrostatic interactions . in this important contribution , the authors provided for the first time evidence of a density of states that is a bimodal function of the density @xmath2 , a necessary feature of a ll critical point .",
    "importantly , the authors also showed that the fluctuations of the order parameter ( a combination of density and energy ) are consistent with the expected shape for a critical system in the ising universality class .",
    "more recently , limmer and chandler  @xcite have questioned the interpretation of all previously published simulations based on the st2 potential , arguing that `` that behaviors others have attributed to a liquid - liquid transition in water and related systems are in fact reflections of transitions between liquid and crystal . '' in the case of the recent calculations of liu , et al .",
    "@xcite , ref .",
    "@xcite proposes that `` the liu et al .",
    "result is a non - equilibrium phenomenon , where a long molecular dynamics run initiated from their low - density amorphous phase and run at constant @xmath0 and @xmath3 will eventually equilibrate in either the low density crystal or ( more likely ) in the higher density metastable liquid . ''",
    "it is thus of paramount importance to independently check the findings of liu , et al .",
    "@xcite , and at the same time , test whether or not the ldl phase is truly a disordered liquid phase characterized by a well - defined metastable equilibrium that is distinct from the crystal phase .    in this article , we conduct these tests by carrying out an independent evaluation of the density of states based on the successive umbrella sampling technique  @xcite .",
    "we implement the original st2 model , with the reaction field correction for the long range electrostatic forces , rather than ewald sums , to be able to strictly compare our results with previously published data for st2  @xcite , as well as to test if the ll transition is robust and independent of the treatment of the long range interactions . as we show below",
    ", we find that our results are entirely consistent with those of liu , et al .",
    "@xcite , as well as with earlier simulation data .",
    "we further find that there is no contribution to the density of states due to crystal formation , confirming the distinct existence of both the hdl and ldl phases for @xmath0 less than @xmath4 , the temperature of the ll critical point .",
    "we study the original st2 potential as defined by rahman and stillinger  @xcite , with reaction field corrections to approximate the long - range contributions to the electrostatic interactions . in the st2 potential ,",
    "water is modeled as a rigid body with an oxygen atom at the center and four charges , two positive and two negative , located at the vertices of a tetrahedron .",
    "the distances from the oxygen to the positive and negative charges are 0.1 and 0.08  nm , respectively .",
    "the oxygen - oxygen interaction is modeled using a lennard - jones potential with @xmath5  nm and @xmath6 kj / mol .",
    "we truncate this lennard - jones interaction at @xmath7 , accounting for the residual interactions through standard long range corrections , i.e. assuming the radial distribution function can be approximated by unity beyond the cutoff .",
    "the charge - charge interactions are smoothly switched off both at small and large distances via a tapering function , as in the original version of the model  @xcite .",
    "our grand canonical monte carlo ( mc ) algorithm is based on roto - translational moves , insertions , and deletions , each attempted with ratios 2:1:1 .",
    "our simulation box is cubic with sides of length @xmath8  nm .",
    "the displacement move is accomplished by a random translation in each direction of up to @xmath9  nm and a random rotation of up to @xmath10  rad around a random direction , resulting in an acceptance ration of about 50@xmath11 .",
    "insertion and deletion moves have a much smaller acceptance ratio , of the order of @xmath12 .",
    "the simulations have thus been performed for more than @xmath13 attempted insertion / deletion moves . to determine the dependence of the density of states on @xmath0 we have investigated four distinct temperatures , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17  k. previous numerical estimates based on the eos indicate @xmath18 k  @xcite .",
    "to study the phase behavior of the system we implement successive umbrella sampling ( sus ) mc simulations  @xcite , from which we evaluate the probability density @xmath19 for the values of @xmath2 sampled by the equilibrium system at fixed @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and volume @xmath20 , and in which the number of molecules @xmath21 in the system fluctuates . in the sus method , the pertinent range of @xmath2 to be investigated , written in terms of the lower and upper number of molecules ( respectively @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) , is divided into many small overlapping windows of size @xmath24 . for each window , a separate grand canonical mc simulation monitors how often a state of @xmath21 particles is visited .",
    "moreover , the simulations are constrained using appropriate boundary conditions on @xmath21 , such that deletions or insertions that would cause @xmath21 to vary outside the range assigned to that window are rejected  @xcite .",
    "the density histograms for each window can then be combined to obtain the full @xmath19 curve , by imposing the equality of the probability at the overlapping boundary . in our study @xmath25 ( corresponding to a minimum density @xmath26 g/@xmath27 ) and @xmath28 ( corresponding to @xmath29 g/@xmath27 ) .",
    "we have chosen @xmath30 , i.e. @xmath21 is only permitted to take on one of two adjacent integer values within each window .",
    "the sus method has a number of advantages .",
    "the use of narrow windows in @xmath21 allows an effective sampling of the microstates without the use of biasing functions .",
    "since the windows are independent , all the simulations can be run in parallel , with a gain in throughput that scales linearly with the number of processors employed . in our case ,",
    "approximately 130 processors are used for the calculations at each @xmath0 , one for each window . at the lowest @xmath0 ,",
    "more than two months of simulation time for each window is required for good sampling .",
    "once we obtain @xmath19 at fixed @xmath0 and @xmath1 , histogram reweighting techniques  @xcite can be applied to obtain @xmath19 at different values of @xmath1 . keeping track of the coupled density - energy histogram during the sus simulations",
    "also allows us to estimate @xmath19 at different @xmath0 via temperature reweighting .",
    "finally , each window provides accurate information on a specific density , allowing us to compare the results with eos data from previous simulations in the canonical ensemble .    to facilitate comparison of our data with future studies , in the following",
    "we will report the activity as @xmath31 ( in units of @xmath32 ) , where @xmath1 is the chemical potential , @xmath33 is @xmath34 , @xmath35 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath36 , @xmath37 is the principal moment of inertia in the direction @xmath38 , @xmath39 is the planck constant and @xmath40 is the de broglie wavelength .",
    "@xmath41 is the quantity that enters in the mc acceptance probability in the insertion - deletion moves .",
    "before discussing the behavior of @xmath19 , we compare our results for the liquid eos as obtained from our sus simulations , with the best available published data . in particular , we focus on the potential energy @xmath42 and the pressure @xmath3 . the pressure is evaluated from the virial using configurations sampled at each density .",
    "[ fig : comparison ] shows results from ref .",
    "@xcite , obtained from molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations , compared with our mc grand - canonical sus results . at all @xmath0 and @xmath2 , we find excellent agreement between these two completely independent numerical methods .",
    "it is worth noting the prominent minimum observed in @xmath42 near @xmath43 g/@xmath27 , the so - called optimal network density  @xcite . at this density",
    "the system has the possibility to be able to satisfy all possible bonds , reaching at low @xmath0 the ideal random tetrahedral network state . at lower densities ,",
    "gas - liquid phase separation intervenes , while at larger densities closer packing prevents the system from satisfying the angular and distance constraints required to form linear hydrogen bonds between all pairs of molecules .",
    "in order to establish that the ll phase transition is a genuine liquid - state phenomenon , we must confirm ( i ) that all our simulations are carried out over a time scale that is much longer than the structural relaxation time of the liquid ; and ( ii ) that the time scale for crystal nucleation is much longer than the time scale for liquid - state relaxation .",
    "the separation of these two time scales provides the `` window '' within which the equilibrium behavior of a supercooled liquid can be defined and quantified .",
    "the ability of modern computer simulations to establish liquid - state equilibrium in simulations near a ll critical point is well documented  @xcite .",
    "in particular , ref .",
    "@xcite presents the dynamical behavior of the same st2 model as is studied here , as determined from md simulations . in fig .",
    "2(a ) of ref .",
    "@xcite , it is shown that the self diffusion constant @xmath44 for oxygen atoms is greater than @xmath45  @xmath46/s at @xmath47  k for all densities from @xmath48 to @xmath49  g/@xmath27 .",
    "this density range spans the same range within which we find bimodal behavior for @xmath19 at @xmath47  k ( see below ) . for the st2 system",
    ", @xmath50  @xmath46/s corresponds to a range of @xmath38-relaxation times @xmath51  ns  @xcite .",
    "time scales well in excess of @xmath52  ns are readily accessible in current md simulations , especially for a small system of a few hundred molecules , as is studied here .",
    "correspondingly , mc simulations of the kind reported here can also easily be run for the number of mc steps required to access equilibrium liquid properties . to demonstrate this , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : eq ] the @xmath19 histograms generated in our simulations as a function of the computing time invested , for @xmath53  k at a fixed value of the activity @xmath41 .",
    "we find that @xmath19 converges to well - defined values for all densities considered here .",
    "in addition we also check that the energy autocorrelation function decays to zero , in all sus windows , in a number of steps smaller than the simulation length .",
    "we also note that ref .",
    "@xcite demonstrates that the dynamical properties of the liquid state of st2 in the low density region near the optimal network density ( @xmath54  g/@xmath27 ) have a very simple and well - defined dependence on @xmath0 , including in the region where @xmath0 approaches @xmath4 and the ldl emerges as a distinct phase .",
    "to to    to",
    "having shown in the previous section that liquid equilibrium is established in our simulations , we next test if crystal nucleation is occurring on the mc time scale of our runs .",
    "this is particularly relevant in view of the conclusions presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which it is argued that the ldl phase does not exist and that the only well - defined state of the system at low density is the crystal .",
    "we therefore must quantify the degree of crystalline order in our system at low @xmath0 , especially in the ldl region , where crystallization might occur on a shorter time scale due to the similarity between ice and the liquid in terms of density and local structure .",
    "to to to    the degree of crystalline order can be quantified using the steinhardt bond order parameters  @xcite based on spherical harmonics of order @xmath55 and @xmath56 , which are particularly suited for discriminating disordered fluid configurations from the open structure of hexagonal ( as well as cubic ) ice . for each particle",

    "are considered neighbors if their oxygen - oxygen distance is smaller than @xmath65  nm , the position of the first minimum of the radial distribution function . in the case of @xmath56 , to be consistent with ref .",
