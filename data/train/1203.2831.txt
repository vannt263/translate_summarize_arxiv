    "in 1976 , de gennes coined the nickname _ ant in the labyrinth _ for the problem of random walks on a fractal structure such as a percolation cluster near the percolation point  @xcite . in 1982 ,",
    "wilke , gefen , ilkovic , aharony , and stauffer  @xcite introduced the _ parasite _ problem as a variant of the former problem in which a random walk takes place on a lattice animal , i.e. , a large percolation cluster in the region right below the percolation point .",
    "the statistics of lattice animals belong to the same universality classes as the statistics of randomly branched polymers ( rbps ) in dilute solutions in their swollen phase and at the collapse transition ( @xmath0-line ) , respectively  @xcite . because cycles or loops of the animals and rbps are irrelevant for these universality classes , they are the same as for lattice trees . in other words ,",
    "the animal or plant on which a random walk takes place in these universality classes is tree - like .",
    "thus , the random walks we are studying in this paper remind us more of a _ monkey on a tree _ than a _ parasite _ on a loop - containing animal , and we prefer to glean our nickname from primatology rather than parasitology .",
    "topologically , trees are @xmath1-dimensional structures .",
    "hence , the backbone between two separated points on a tree consists of an single unique self avoiding walk ( saw ) .",
    "therefore , all the scaling dimensions @xmath2 of the backbone fractals  the backbone itself , the minimal , the mean , and the maximal path , the electrical resistance , the red bonds , _ etc_.   are identical : @xmath3 a clever monkey will climb the minimal path with fractal dimension @xmath4 to get a coconut at the end of the path .",
    "this is in contrast to diffusion , which corresponds to an erratic motion of a monkey .",
    "diffusion , on a fractal medium with fractal dimension @xmath5 is described by the scaling law @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the position of the walker ( here , the monkey ) at time @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the gyration radius of the fractal with mass ( number of sites ) @xmath10 and @xmath11 is a scaling function with the properties @xmath12{lll } 1 & \\text{for } & x\\rightarrow\\infty\\\\ x^{2/d_{w } } & \\text{for } & x\\rightarrow0 \\end{array } \\right .   \\ , .",
    "\\label{scfuprop}\\ ] ] as a result of einstein s relation @xmath13 for the fractal dimension of the random walk , it follows that @xcite @xmath14    as mentioned above , the _ monkey on a tree _ problem has been around under a different name for some 30 years now . for background , we refer to the review article on diffusion in disordered media by havlin and ben - avraham @xcite . in recent years",
    ", significant advancements have been made in numerical simulations on problems different from but closely related to the _ monkey on a tree _ problem .",
    "a sophisticated monte carlo algorithm has been used to simulate lattice animals and trees in 2 to 9 dimensions  @xcite and to measure their static scaling exponents with high precision  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , simulations have been performed to determine with high precision the fractal and multifractal dimensions of saws on percolations clusters in @xmath15 to @xmath16 dimensions  @xcite .",
    "hence , we feel that state of the art simulations of diffusion and transport and lattice animals in dimensions suitable for reliable comparison to field theory have become within reach .",
    "thus , we think it is worthwhile to take a fresh look at the _ monkey on a tree _ problem with field theoretic methods .",
    "the static fractal dimension @xmath17 of the randomly branched polymers or trees are well known @xcite . here",
    ", we apply renormalized dynamical field theory to calculate @xmath4 and the related exponents in an @xmath18-expansion to 2-loop order .",
    "since @xmath4 is equal to the dynamical exponent @xmath19 , the scaling exponent of the time a monkey needs to reach a coconut on a tree , we can and will calculate @xmath4 via calculating @xmath19 of a stochastic process that generates rbps @xcite .",
    "this section serves 2 purposes .",
    "first , we review the field theoretic model for rbps that we have developed recently  @xcite .",
    "some of the steps involved in its derivation are far from trivial , and its symmetry contents is rich and interesting .",
    "hence , we think it is worthwhile to review the model in some detail",
    ". this will also have the benefit of making the present paper more self - contained .",
    "second , we discuss in broad terms the diagrammatics resulting from our dynamical model for the swollen phase and the collapse transition .",
    "we will make the observation that the dynamical self - energy diagrams decompose into a quasi - static part and a saw - part that contains all the frequency dependence .",
    "this observation is a key to the subsequent sections as it simplifies the dynamical field theory for the transport and diffusion exponents considerably .",
    "our field theoretic model for rbps is based on the idea of generating their statistics through a mesoscopic stochastic growth process .",
    "it is well known that the general epidemic process ( gep ) @xcite leads to random structures with the properties of percolation clusters @xcite which are , depending on the parameter - values of the gep , below , at , or above the percolation point .",
    "the primary density - fields describing this process are the field of agents @xmath20 and the field of the inactive debris @xmath21 which ultimately forms the polymer cluster .",
    "the following extension of the gep is a modification of a process that we have introduced for the description of tricritical isotropic percolation @xcite .",
    "the non - markovian langevin equation describing such this process ( or rather its universality class ) is given by @xmath22 here , the parameter @xmath23 tunes the `` distance '' to the percolation threshold .",
    "below this threshold , in the absorbing phase , @xmath23 is positive which we assume throughout this paper . in this case",
    "the typical final clusters of the debris generated from a source @xmath24 of agents consists of @xmath25 particles of the debris , and has a mean diameter ( gyration radius ) @xmath26",
    ". however , here we are _ not _ interested in these typical clusters .",
    "rather , we are interested in the large non - typical clusters , the rare events of the stochastic process , with @xmath27 ( in this sense @xmath28 is a small parameter ) .",
    "we know from percolation theory @xcite that these clusters belong to the universality class of lattice animals .",
    "hence , they are the same in a statistical sense as randomly branched polymers ( rbps ) as far as their universal properties go .",
    "the gradient - term proportional to @xmath29 describes the attractive influence of the debris on the agents if @xmath29 is negative ( as a negative contribution to @xmath30 does ) . in principle , other gradient - terms like @xmath31 and @xmath32 could be added to the langevin equation .",
    "however as long as we have any one of these gradient terms into our theory , an omission of the others has no effect on the final results , and we choose to work with the term proportional to @xmath29 only for simplicity . for usual percolation problems ( ordinary or tricritical ) ,",
    "all of these gradient terms are irrelevant .",
    "as long as @xmath33 , the third order term @xmath34 is irrelevant near the transition point and the process models ordinary percolation near @xmath35 @xcite or non - typical very large clusters , the swollen rbps , for @xmath36 .",
    "we permit both signs of @xmath30 ( negative values of @xmath30 correspond to an attraction of the agents by the debris , see above ) .",
    "hence , our model allows for a tricritical instability ( tricritical percolation near @xmath35 @xcite or the collapse transition of the rbps for @xmath36 @xcite ) .",
    "consequently we need the third order term with @xmath37 ( representing self - avoidance ) to limit the density to finite values in these cases .",
    "physically it originates from the suppression of agents by the debris .",
    "the gaussian noise - source @xmath38 has correlations @xmath39 the first part of the noise correlation ( [ abs - noise ] ) takes into account that the agents can decay spontaneously , and thus @xmath40 .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath11 simulates the anticorrelating or correlating ( from attraction ) behavior of the noise in regions where debris has already been produced . if the coupling constant @xmath11 becomes negative , attraction effects prevail . for ordinary percolation",
    "this term is irrelevant .",
    "the form of the dependence of both parts of the noise correlation on the field is mandated by the fact that the process has to be strongly absorbing in order to model rbps .    in the past",
    ", there have been misconceptions about the relation between absorptivity and the form of the noise correlation , and we think that it is worthwhile to address this relation here in a little more detail . as we just mentioned , our rbp - generating process is like all percolation processes strongly absorbing , i.e. , its extinction probability ( probability that the process becomes extinct in a _ finite _ time - interval @xmath41 ) is larger than zero , @xmath42 for @xmath43 . to guarantee this property , all terms in the equation of motion ( [ lang - eq ] )",
    "must contain of course at least one power of @xmath44 .",
    "moreover , and this is the important point here , the expansion of the noise - correlation function  ( [ abs - noise ] ) in the density @xmath44 _ must _ begin with a _ linear _ term @xcite .",
    "with respect to enforcing strong absorptivity , a quadratic part in @xmath44 of the noise correlation is insufficient .",
    "the upshot is that phenomenological considerations are sufficient to uniquely determine the form of the noise .",
    "there is no need to resort to a microscopic formulation in terms of master equations or the like to figure out the proper relevant contributions to the noise correlations for the current process nor is it for percolation processes in general .      to proceed towards a field theoretic model ( for the general method of field theory in statistical physics see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) , the langevin equations ( [ lang - eq ] ) and ( [ abs - noise ] ) are now transformed into a stochastic response functional in the ito - sense @xcite @xmath45   &   = \\int d^{d}x\\big\\{\\lambda\\int dt\\,\\tilde{n}\\big(\\lambda^{-1}\\partial_{t}-\\nabla^{2 } \\nonumber\\\\ & -c\\nabla m\\cdot \\nabla + r_{p}+g^{\\prime}m + \\frac{f^{\\prime}}{2}m^{2}-\\frac{g}{2}\\tilde{n}\\big)n \\nonumber\\\\ & + \\frac{f } { 2}\\big(\\lambda\\int dt\\,\\tilde{n}n\\big)^{2}\\big\\}\\ , .",

    "when a source - term @xmath48 is added , where @xmath49 and @xmath50 denotes an integral of a product of two fields over space and time , this functional describes , in particular , the statistics of clusters of debris generated by the stochastic growth process ( [ lang - eq ] ) from a source of @xmath28 agents at the point @xmath51 at time zero . denoting by @xmath52 $ ] the functional integration over the fields with boundary conditions @xmath53 , we generally have for the generating functional @xmath54=\\operatorname*{tr}\\bigl[\\exp\\bigl(-\\mathcal{j } _ { \\text{egep}}[\\tilde{n},n]+(\\tilde{j},\\tilde{n})+(j , n)\\bigr]=1\\ ] ] if the arbitrary sources @xmath55 _ or _ @xmath56 are zero .",

    "then , @xmath127 reduces to the dynamical response functional of the usual simple gep .",
    "recently , we have shown that @xmath111 becomes weakly irrelevant ( with a correction exponent of order @xmath128 ) at the rg fixed point corresponding to the collapse transition of rbps  @xcite .",

    "in other words : large rbps in the swollen phase and at the collapse transition are dominated by tree - configurations .",
    "the last step in setting up the response functional for the dynamical description of swollen or collapsing rbps is a duality transformation that interchanges absorptivity in favor of causality : @xmath129 this step leads to the response functional @xmath130 which will serve us in the following as the vantage point of our dynamical field theory .    in this paper",
    ", we are mainly interested in the dynamical aspects of our theory . on occasion , however , we will also discuss some of its static aspects .",

    ", we do not need the full response functional .",

    "in addition to these elements represented by lines , there are the 3 vertices shown at the bottom of fig .",
    "[ fig : elements ] .",
    "recall that we are primarily interested in scaling exponents for transport and diffusion on rbps .",

    "its dynamical renormalization is known only to 1-loop order for the swollen phase as shown by one of us @xcite and entirely unknown for the collapse transition .",
    "hence , it is our main task here to calculate the renormalization factor @xmath144 pertaining to the dynamical coefficient @xmath145 . to this end , we consider the one - particle irreducible amputated self - energy diagrams with an outgoing amputated @xmath146-leg and an ingoing amputated @xmath142-leg .",
    "let us forget for the moment all the static @xmath147-lines of a diagram that are introduced by the couplings to the static field @xmath135 .",

    "it is clear need to put these insertions only into the @xmath148-lines forming the connecting saw .",

    "then , fourier - transformation from time - arguments to frequencies shows that the frequency flowing out through a @xmath146-leg is the sum of the frequencies flowing into the diagram through the corresponding set of @xmath142-legs .",

    "having derived the theorems ( [ theoremt ] ) and ( [ theoremc ] ) , we now can use them to extract relations between the counter - terms encountered in our 2-loop calculations . applying the @xmath416-procedure , we obtain @xmath417 the @xmath418-procedure provides us with the relations @xmath419 these five relations determine all the four 2-loop counter - terms near @xmath126 dimensions from the five 2-loop counter - terms near @xmath196 dimensions and in addition to that provide us one supplementary consistency check for our calculations .                                                      h.k .",
