    "the absorption of hydrogen in metals , in particular pd - based materials , has attracted great interest due to its unique behavior , including its high solubility and activity  @xcite .",
    "however , it is also known that the interaction of impurity and the defects in host materials would drastically affect their properties and performance . specifically , both experimental and theoretical investigations have evidenced that defects such as vacancy , dislocations and grain boundary in metals can attract a high localization of impurities ,  @xcite and subsequently are responsible for many prominent phenomena .",
    "these effects , nevertheless , require a threshold concentration of hydrogen at intrinsic binding sites .",
    "therefore , the learning of the h saturation at these locations could be critical for the understanding of their behavior .",
    "in general , hydrogen diffusion in crystals is active by first occupying interstitial positions until they are trapped in open volumes ( such as vacancy or grain boundary ) .",
    "in fact , it was suggested that the coalescence of vacancies in the presence of h will provide source for microcrack initiation and subsequent embrittlement  @xcite .",
    "also , experiments performed by fukai et al . evidenced that high h absorption can introduce the formation of superabundant vacancies in several transition metals  @xcite .",
    "grain boundaries , on the other hand , can serve as ideal transport channels for impurity elements , at the same time could also be prefered nucleation site of dislocation and voids that results in stress corrosion cracking .",
    "@xcite some authors suggested that hydrogen causes embrittlement in pd by decreasing the cohesive strength of gb , since h acts electron - receptor and weaken the bonding of host atoms across gb .",
    "@xcite    due to the intricate nature of these phenomena , real - time measurements and observations can be restricted .",
    "@xcite recent advances in computer powers and computational theory have made the atomistic simulation an excellent tool for the investigation of materials properties .",
    "in fact , first - principles calculations have been widely used and succeeded in describing structural properties at electronic level , particularly for the treatment of defect phenomena in solids .",
    "@xcite in this paper , we have examined the interactions of hydrogen with defects in both pd single crystal and bicrystal .",
    "the segregation of h at grain boundary and vacancy up to their saturated state was investigated in order to understand the process of h localization in palladium at the very fundamental level .",
    "the density functional theory ( dft ) ,  @xcite as implemented in vienna ab - initio simulation package ( vasp ) ,  @xcite was employed to perform the first - principles calculations . in this work ,",
    "the crystal properties of pd were described by the electron projector - augmented wave ( paw ) methods  @xcite with the pbe generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) exchange - correlation ,  @xcite unless noted otherwise .",
    "bulk pd crystal was simulated using a supercell of 108 face - centered cubic ( fcc ) atoms ; in which the convergence of total energy is 0.1 mev per atom .",
    "additionally , a bicrystal model of 80 atomic sites was constructed to simulate a symmetric tilt @xmath05/(210)/@xmath1 grain boundary in pd . in the k - space sampling , we have used a monkhorst - pack grid  @xcite of 4@xmath24@xmath24 for the single - crystal and 4@xmath24@xmath22 for bicrystal supercells , for the plane wave basis , respectively . in calculating the total energy ,",
    "equilibrated structures are obtained by relaxing the atomic positions and the lattice vectors until stress components @xmath3@xmath4 , @xmath3@xmath5 and @xmath3@xmath6 are all well below 1.0 kbar .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are imposed in three dimensions .    the precipitation of impurity atoms ensues from the migration through grain boundaries , as well as the generation of vacancies .",
    "to demonstrate the binding tendency between hydrogen impurity and palladium host atoms , the concept of absorption energy is used ; its average value , e@xmath7@xmath8 , from absorption of n hydrogen atoms , is calculated by the following equation :  @xcite    @xmath9 = e_{tot}^{nh } - e_{tot}^{0h } - \\frac{n}{2}e^{h_{2}}\\ ] ]    where e@xmath10@xmath11 and e@xmath10@xmath12 describe total energy of systems with n hydrogen segregation and at clean state , respectively .",
    "e@xmath13 is the total energy of one isolated hydrogen molecule , calculated by placing that molecule in a large supercell ( 20@xmath220@xmath220  ) .",
    "the formation energy of one vacancy in any system is obtained from the change in total energies of that system before ( @xmath14 ) and after the formation of vacancy ( e@xmath10@xmath15 ) , adding the average energy of one pd atom in bulk state ( e@xmath16@xmath17 ) : @xmath18    in order to illustrate the site competition between h segregation in vacancy ( or grain boundary ) with h binding in interstitial , we calculate the trapping energy of h. its average value therefore is calculated with respect to the change in total energy of bulk palladium e@xmath10@xmath19-e@xmath10@xmath12 , by adding one h as interstitial :  @xcite    @xmath20 = \\frac{1}{n}(e_{tot}^{nh - v } - e_{tot}^{0h - v } ) - ( e_{tot}^{1h } - e_{tot}^{0h } ) \\\\",

    "the trapping energy of the single n@xmath23 h atom can be estimated by the difference in total trapping energies between n and ( n-1 ) h atoms :    @xmath24 = ne_{tr}^{vac}[nh ] - ( n-1)e_{tr}^{vac}[(n-1)h]\\\\    \\delta e_{tr}^{gb}[n ]   = ne_{tr}^{gb}[nh ]   - ( n-1)e_{tr}^{gb}[(n-1)h]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "for a simple crystal such as fcc palladium , octahedral ( o - site ) and tetrahedral ( t - site ) are two common types of interstices . the nearest tetrahedral interstitial ( t ) is in [ 1 1 1 ] direction .",
    "the nearest octahedral interstitial ( o1 ) is in [ 1 0 0 ] and the second nearest one ( o2 ) is in [ 1 1 1 ] as at the center of the unit cell body ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]a ) . using equation  [ absorption ] , the calculations of bulk pd show that the binding ( or absorption ) energy of h to o - site is -0.1 ev , which is stronger than that at t - site ( -0.05 ev ) .",
    "this suggests a preference of h occupation at o - site over the other in pd matrix .",

    "is calculated with respect to binding energy of one h atom to the octahedral interstitial ( the zero level corresponds to the binding energy of h to octahedral interstitial ) . in agreement with previous works in metals ,",
    "@xcite our calculation also showed that the center of vacancy is a very unfavorable binding site for h. parts of the curves below the zero level indicate possible regions around a vacancy at which h binding is stronger than that of a general octahedral binding ( with no vacancy ) . at the same time , this indicates that the formation of the nearest - neighbor vacancy makes h binding at octahedral site stronger ( o1 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . however , it is interesting that the most energetically stable site for h - vacancy binding is in [ 111 ] direction , close to its tetrahedral position ( t in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this h bonding will be threefold , instead of fourfold , due to one missing pd ( vacancy ) .",
    "farther in [ 111 ] direction , vacancy has no effect on h binding at its second nearest octahedral interstitial ( as trapping energy at o2 site is zero ) .",

    "its values is everywhere positive along [ 100 ] direction , width=6 ]    using local - density approximation ( lda ) method , vekilova et .",
    "al  @xcite reported about a possibility of multiple hydrogen occupancy , in which a maximum of six hydrogen atoms can be trapped in a monovacancy .",
    "the most favorable sites were reported to be along the directions of [ 100 ] family , as six octahedral sites coordinate a pd atom . however , in our work with gga , that configuration of vach@xmath25 is not energetically favorable .",
    "instead , we found that the stable structure of monovacancy with most h will contain eight h atoms , surrounding the vacancy at its tetrahedral sites . with this maximum number of h occupations , the h binding is still competitively stronger than the general octahedral binding in bulk ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]a ) .",
    "however , the insertion of any extra h into this vach@xmath26 configuration will result in a positive trapping energy , i.e. the extra h is likely to diffuse away and occupy an interstitial site elsewhere .",
    "[ fig2]b shows the variation of trapping energy of the 9@xmath23 h with respect to its distance from vacancy center in [ 100 ] direction .",

    "it is commonly believed that the formation of a di - vacancy is less costly than the formation of two separate vacancies .",

    "when h local concentration at grain boundary exceeds the saturation level , hydrogen is attracted by interstitial sites in bulk.,width=8 ]    in this subsection , we will discuss the occupation of h at a @xmath05 ( 210 ) grain boundary , as mentioned earlier that grain boundaries play a significant role in the issue of impurity transport and segregation . using equation  [ trap_avg ] , the average trapping energy",
    "was calculated as a function of h occupation at this gb ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the absorption ( segregation ) energy differs from trapping energy by the value of one h octahedral binding . according to rice - wang theory ,  @xcite",
    ", it was commonly accepted that h is an interfacial embrittler by segregation energy .",
    "@xcite our simulation showed that the average segregation energy is negative for h occupations up to 36 atoms at this @xmath05 ( 210 ) grain boundary .",
    "in other words , a complex of gbh@xmath29 could be thermodynamically feasible .",
    "however , fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] indicated that the average trapping energy is positive with approximately more than 28 h occupations , , i.e. further absorption of h is energetically unfavorable .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows the atomic configuration of pd bicrystal cells at h - clean state and with 28 h occupation around gb plane .",
    "if only five pd atom layers around gb are taken into account , then the local h concentration is roughly 140 % at .",
    "( pd@xmath30h@xmath31 )    due to the geometry of gb , there are hollow sites on gb plane that could host impurity atoms . however , h atoms are unlikely to stay in those empty spaces or form hydrogen gas themselves ; instead , they bind closely with pd .",
    "the average h - pd bond length is approximately 1.8  , which is roughly equivalent to a bond between a tetrahedral h and pd in bulk .",
    "also , we found that the most common h - pd bonding at gb is threefold .",
    "this configuration contains an h atom bound with pd at three vertices of a ( quasi-)tetrahedron , while the the forth vertex is missing .",
    "this h - pd binding is identical to the configuration of h - vacancy complex , while h found itself most comfortable at the tetrahedral interstitial ( but bonds with only three pd due to one missing pd vacancy , fig .",
    "[ fig1]a ) .",
    "while h binds threefold , it displays that one pd atom can also participate in several h - pd bonds ( fig .",
    "[ fig4]b ) .    to differentiate between pd atom layers at grain boundary , we index them gb0 , gb1 , gb2 ... , depending on how far they are from the grain boundary plane ( fig .  [ fig4]a ) . due to the symmetry characterization of this gb ,",
    "layers with opposite indices are equivalent ( e.g. gb1 and gb-1 ) .",
    "when h atoms surround pd , firstly , they weaken pd - pd bond . secondly , pd - pd can even be broken , as there is an expansion between pd layers due to high h - gb occupancy .",
    "for instance , the distance between layers gb2 and gb-2 increase from 3.83  ( at h - clean state ) up to 4.82  at the suggested h saturation ( 28 h atoms for this 80-pd bicrystal supercell ) .",
    "next , we investigate the question of how h localization would influence the formation of vacancy around the gb domain .",
    "as presented in table  [ table2 ] , the first pd layers ( gb1 and gb-1 ) are more likely to form vacancy , with the formation energy significantly reduced .",
    "farther away , the effect of grain boundary and vacancy formation would be minimal .",
    "the presence of hydrogen in this case , however , has minimal effect on the formation of vacancy at the gb vicinities .",
    "for instance , with eight ( or twenty - eight ) h atoms segregation at grain boundary , the vacancy formation energy at gb1 even increases slightly to 0.55 ev ( or 0.63 ev , repectively ) , compared to its value of 0.48 ev in h - clean state .",
    "therefore , unlike h - vacancy binding , h - gb segregation does nt tend to initiate hydrogen embrittlement through microvoid formation . instead , high h content could result in a decohesion across the pd grain boundary and subsequently , the hydrogen embrittlement could be initiated by the grain separation at sufficient external stress .",
    "this observation is in agreement with calculations using rice - wang model , in which single h was reportedly a gb embrittler by reducing the grain cohesion .",
    "@xcite    lcdr & + gb0 & 1.29 + gb1 & 0.48 + gb2 & 1.00 + gb3 & 1.04 + gb4 & 1.06 + gb5 & 1.09 +",
    "we have reported the saturated localization of h binding at vacancy and grain boundary in pd crystals .",
    "theoretical investigations for favorable configurations of h - vacancy and h - gb complexes from low to high h occupation were presented .",
    "while h prefers to occupy the octahedral interstitial position , they are anticipated to fill in the tetrahedral sites in complex with a pd vacancy .",
    "our calculation showed that one pd vacancy is capable of storing up to eight h , instead of six as reported previously .",
    "@xcite pairing of vacancies is encouraging in [ 110 ] direction , and h presence will further assist multi - vacancy formation , which implies the hydrogen embrittlement by connections of microvoids . numerous experimental observation and theoretical calculations have reached to the same conclusions on vacancy formation induced by hydrogen .    in both cases of open defects ( vacancy and grain boundary )",
    ", hydrogen prefers a threefold bonding with palladium . however , h segregation at gb results in weakening pd - pd bonds across gb , by inducing the grain separation .",
    "this observation supports the decohesion mechanism of hydrogen embrittlement as evidenced by many experiments .",
