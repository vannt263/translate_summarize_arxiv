    "there is no commonly used definition of complexity but terms ` complex ' network , and ` complex system ' are used often and they are important because they describe one of the most dynamically developing discipline of science .",
    "complexity has many different aspects , each one leading to its own definition of complexity .",
    "each of those definitions can be adequate in a particular range of phenomena .",
    "probably one common definition does not exist .",
    "there are as many different definitions @xcite as different aspects and applications of this notion . on the internet",
    "a ` complexity_zoo ' can be found : `` there are now 489 classes and counting ! '' . typically together with a definition , a certain measure of complexity",
    "is also proposed , e.g. , solomonov - kolmogorov - chaitin algorithmic complexity @xcite or simply number of elements of system @xcite is used . in ref .",
    "@xcite two measures of statistical complexity are tested when the system size is increased : are the results compatible with intuitive requirements for complexity measures in three special cases : ( i ) adding one element , ( ii ) adding an independent system and ( iii ) adding a perfect copy of the original system .",
    "however , the terms ` complex network ' and ` complex system ' are understood as two state alternative : complex or not complex .",
    "such understanding needs some threshold to be defined , over which a system or network is complex but below it - not complex .",
    "our intuition connects this threshold to our ability to predict the behaviour of a given system .",
    "if it needs too many well measured parameters and too many of interaction and conditions which should be taken under consideration , then we name it as too ` complex ' to be solved .",
    "but such ` definition ' is too subjective . in order not to be a subjective criterion ,",
    "this threshold must be an effect of a particular objective phenomenon , e.g. in self - organising criticality @xcite after some parameters reach a critical value , the system will spontaneously exhibit behaviour characterized by power laws or in scale - free networks @xcite , above a critical network size , the average length of the path between two nodes will not change with the growth of the network .    the term ` big system ' was replaced by ` complex network ' in widespread use",
    ". our threshold should be therefore a threshold in network size upon which effects of small networks ( ` finite size effects ' ) disappear in practice and ` large network ' is a good approximation .",
    "continuing with the subjective suggestion we can convert it to a particular formulation in the network language : if similar initial states of system typically lead to similar effects , then in average for one state which should be predicted , with high probability we can predict the effect simply by comparing initial states to the known ones .",
    "such a case is named ` structural stability ' in ref .",
    "@xcite , i prefer not to name it ` complex ' despite the fact that network can be large .",
    "however , if similar initial states lead to very different effects , then the prediction is not so easy and it seems complex .",
    "sensitivity to initial conditions is the most important property of ` chaos ' .",
    "it can be observed by watching the effects of a small initial difference of two functioning systems .",
    "typically @xcite two identical systems are taken , in one of them a small ` disturbance ' is introduced , and differences called ` damage ' in states of network nodes during consecutive steps of function of both networks ( i.e. : ` damage spreading ' ) are watched .",
    "networks in which damage typically grows are named ` chaotic ' @xcite .",
    "this notion of chaos is a little different from the typically used and well defined @xcite notion for continuous functions .",
    "it considers finite networks with finite ( however - large ) number of states .",
    "damage can not grow infinitely but it reaches an equilibrium level instead .",
    "however , in this range of applications it is undoubtedly the same phenomenon .",
    "our subjective meaning of a ` complex network ' appears to be similar or equal to the term ` chaotic network ' and is connected to the number of network elements @xmath1 .",
    "let us check if there exists in degree of chaos some threshold - like phenomenon when number @xmath1 of network elements grows .",
    "in other words : is there a ` transition ' to chaos ( from order ) or something similar during network growth ? we can treat this transition as the complexity threshold .",
    "it should objectively indicate a particular value of @xmath1 , but this value may depend on other parameters of network . the notion : ` degree of chaos ' is also unclear and",
    "can be understood in different ways .",
    "clarifying this picture is the main goal of this paper . in the effect we found that investigated phenomenon is not a critical one - chaotic properties emerge smoothly , however in relatively short stage of growth , and the main practical criterion depends a little on number of events .",
    "it is an effect of critical point ( percolation ) which was crossed for much smaller network .",
    "such an approach bases on the assumption that living objects ( which we are going to describe ) are chaotic much more than the kauffman s conception ` life on the edge of chaos ' expects , because homeostasis based on negative feedbacks are there underestimated @xcite .",
    "as was mentioned in the beginning , each complexity definition or criterion is designed for a particular application .",
    "this approach can ( and does ) give us a certain definition of complexity , but it is ( like others ) not a general one .",
    "it does not consider e.g. ordered networks , which can also be complex in some respects for some applications .",
    "such defined complexity and its threshold are connected to the mechanism of structural tendencies which appear as statistical effects of adaptive evolution of complex ( in this meaning ) functioning networks but they do not appear for small networks . this criterion is needed for definition of range of their appearances .",
    "structural tendencies are a main goal of my approach which start from ref @xcite where rsn and ` reversed annealed ' algorithm are introduced .",
    "complexity threshold is now discussed , and on this base i will next investigate structural tendencies .",
    "i hope that the proposed notion and criterion of complexity of networks and systems fulfil well most of the expectations when term ` complex network ' is used .",
    "this article is a next step after ref .",
    "@xcite where rsn - random , ( @xmath0 ) equally probable signal variants network was introduced , ` reversed annealed ' algorithm was described and living systems were shifted on chaotic shore of kauffman s liquid area near the edge of chaos .",
    "this two articles create a base for investigation of structural tendencies shortly described in ref .",
    "therefore in the second section ( ch.2 ) brief reminding of ref .",
    "@xcite can be found , necessary for understanding of the current paper .",
    "however , without reading ref .",
    "@xcite a lot of less important details could remain unclear .",
    "one of the most important theme ( negative feedbacks and position of living systems on order - chaos axis ) discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite is shifted here to ch.4.5 ` important interpretative remarks ' .",
    "next , new ( relatively to the first article ) additional assumptions are defined in ch.3 .",
    "1- in the first article autonomous networks are considered , now connection to environment is introduced and networks become not autonomous .",
    "external inputs are fixed , but on the external outputs of network certain damage is observed . in the next step fitness will be defined on external network outputs .",
    "2- in adaptive evolution investigation in the next step of my approach not only node additions but also removing of nodes must be considered .",
    "removing of nodes creates new phenomena which strongly influence network features .",
    "they significantly change @xmath4 ` node degree distribution ' because node with @xmath5 ( without outputs ) are created .",
    "therefore two new network types are added to investigated set of network types .",
    "these are networks @xmath6 ( scale - free similar to sfrbn ) and @xmath7 ( single scale similar to efrbn ) with 30% of random removals of nodes",
    "which , for the purpose of this paper , are named @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively .",
    "chapter ch.4 describes simulations and their results .",
    "mainly damage size distribution is watched during network growth in two variants - fraction of damaged nodes and number of damaged outputs for different network types and parameters : @xmath10 - number of equally probable signal variants and @xmath11 - number of node input fixed for a particular network .",
    "discussion of precision of obtained results and causes of their dispersion is interesting .",
    "it uncovers large natural fluctuation of investigated processes and leads to experiment which is a base of name ` reversed - annealed ' for used algorithm .",
    "this experiment could not have been described in ref . @xcite together with algorithm .",
    "degree of chaos in dependence especially on network type and differences of both types of damage size are discussed in this chapter . in all four considered dependencies a critical point",
    "does nt occur in region of ` complexity threshold ' , however , matured chaotic features emerge and effects of small network practically disappear .",
    "section ch.5 is dedicated for interpretation , explanation and intuition .",
    "it helps in understanding the obtained results of simulation .",
    "especially the depth in network is defined there , which differ places inside network .",
    "it is the smallest path from node to network external outputs .",
    "this article is a next step after @xcite creating base for structural tendencies . as a starting point",
    "we consider `` quenched '' - deterministic dynamics of the boolean networks @xcite .",
    "the first step has introduced a few important elements necessary for understanding this paper , especially rsn ( random signal network ) , which takes there a significant part of the article - their description should not be fully repeated in any next paper - only the most important elements will be recapitulated in short here .",
    "there was introduced a parameter @xmath10 - number of equally probable variants of signal which can be greater than two and this defines rsn .",
    "its role in degree of chaos ( in wide meaning ) was discussed for different network types as well as a comparison to the influence of @xmath11 parameter ( number of inputs per node , fixed for particular network in this approach ) .",
    "as opposed to most works using kauffman networks i do not agree with the `` life at the edge of chaos '' hypothesis in kauffman s form .",
    "i believe that the darwinian mechanism is much more powerful than this hypothesis assumes and is the source of main part of order and stability found in living objects .",
    "i estimate that chaotic networks are typically more adequate for description of real living objects and the case @xmath14 can not be neglected , but it causes that kauffman networks become something more than boolean ones and rbn is not an adequate name any more . in the current article",
    "the degree of chaos is the main investigated parameter , now its relation to the number of system elements @xmath1 will be examined .",
    "however in ref .",
    "@xcite the ` degree of chaos ' is not a defined parameter yet .",
    "there were discussed a few phenomena connected to chaos which can be used to assess the level of chaos in a network .",
    "one of these phenomena will be formally named ` degree of chaos ' @xmath15 in ch.2.3 ( in similar way like ` degree of order ' in ref .",
    "@xcite ) but it is only one of aspects of general notion of ` degree of chaos ' .    an important effect of values of @xmath10 other than the typical one ( @xmath3 ) is higher equilibrium level of damage @xmath13 ( - fraction of nodes with damaged state ) . in ch.2 in ref .",
    "@xcite a theoretical expectation ( `` annealed approximation '' model ) independent of network @xmath16 , ( in kauffman network range ) described for @xmath3 in ref .",
    "@xcite , ( also in ref .",
    "@xcite p.200 fig.5.8 , or in ref .",
    "@xcite fig.b.2 ) were expanded for higher @xmath10 .",
    "for ordered networks , the levels of damage ( not predicted using such method ) are much lower which can be one of the characteristics used to distinguish between not chaotic and chaotic networks .",
    "functions of nodes are assumed to be fully random , however , they are virtually not used in ref .",
    "@xcite and here in simplified simulations .",
    "the research will be continued on the same basic set of network types defined in ref .",
    "@xcite in details . in short : kauffman networks are the most adequate to describe adaptive systems because they function which produces an effect which can be assessed and improved .",
    "the function formula of kauffman network gives us a useful ability to differentiate @xmath12 ( - number of outgoing links of nodes , degree of node ) within the network .",
    "kauffman and many other researchers who followed him used erds - rnyi random networks @xcite , but with @xmath3 and fixed number of incoming links @xmath11 .",
    "these networks are named rbn ( random boolean network ) , but later this name has got two meanings - it describes also a wider class of networks and the name ` crbn'@xcite ( classical ) for erds - rnyi random networks was proposed .",
    "i denote it as @xmath19 but i use @xmath0 ( in range of rsn ) .",
    "i have introduced @xmath14 in ref .",
    "@xcite , ( earlier in refs .",
    "@xcite ) . kauffman network and boolean network were synonyms .",
    "i think that rsn ( without aggregate of automata network family ) , rwn@xcite and rns @xcite using more than two variants of node state should remain ` kauffman networks ' .",
    "different types of networks differ in the distribution of node degree @xmath4 .",
    "nowadays famous barabsi - albert scale - free network seems to be more adequate in most cases to describe reality @xcite than the old @xmath19 network . using it in the kauffman network frame",
    "i denote it as @xmath6 , however in ref .",
    "@xcite where @xmath3 and @xmath11 is not fixed , the name sfrbn is used .",
    "such a network was earlier investigated in ref .",
    "this network @xmath16 has a characteristic ` preferential attachment ' pattern for growth which leads to power law distribution of node degree .",
    "node degree distribution @xmath4 for @xmath19 is a bell - like curve which ends quickly for relatively small @xmath12 .",
    "between these two types lies the next candidate for investigation - ` single - scale'@xcite network @xmath16 @xmath7 which grows without preferences . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is named efrbn ( exponential - fluctuation random boolean network ) and is similarly considered together with sfrbn ( but there @xmath3 and @xmath11 is not fixed ) .",
    "its node degree distribution @xmath4 decreases faster ( exponentially ) and is less extreme than for @xmath6 networks .",
    "the coefficient @xmath20 of damage multiplication on one node is introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , earlier in refs .",
    "@xcite and similar in ref .",
    "@xcite . it is a useful notion for understanding of damage spreading which will be used also in this paper for explanation . to understand the coefficient @xmath18 in the kauffman network where all @xmath12 outputs of a node transmit the same signal",
    ", we must average the changes of signals and the @xmath12 for lots of nodes .",
    "it is much simpler and more intuitive and the averaging of the change is possible in one node if @xmath12 is fixed and each output of a node has its own signal to transmit .",
    "in such a case @xmath21 and the function value ( node state , outputs ) is a @xmath11-dimensional vector .",
    "i have introduced such a network in refs .",
    "i have named it ` aggregate of automata ' , therefore i name it here @xmath22 .    for complex @xmath22 network",
    "the ` structural tendencies ' was first investigated and they occur very strong @xcite . for comparison to the kauffman networks described above , the @xmath23 network @xmath16 similar to @xmath22 was defined which follows the kauffman network rule ( one signal on all outputs ) , but @xmath24 remains fixed .",
    "however , networks with flexible @xmath12 are more rich in different phenomena and mechanisms .      in ref .",
    "@xcite above set ( @xmath25 ) of networks was simulated for different parameters @xmath10 ( @xmath3,3,4 ) and @xmath11 ( @xmath2,3,4 ) near transition from chaos to order .",
    "note , that @xmath10 is the number of equally probable signal variants defining rsn . from full",
    "set of combinations the case @xmath3 , @xmath2 was removed because it is an extreme one - it always leads to ordered network , but these values are the lowest sensible of these parameters . in refs .",
    "@xcite the range @xmath26 is investigated as the most interesting one , however , they mainly consider ordered phase and the point of phase transition to chaos . in such a network there must appear nodes with one input and one output but using fixed @xmath27 network becomes extreme and i neglect such case .    for all other combinations ( higher values of parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) chaos is expected .",
    "higher value of each parameter leads to higher level of chaos , e.g. degree of chaos @xmath15 measured using fraction of events in right peak in distribution of damage size .",
    "this peak is directly connected to the large damage avalanche which is the main feature of chaos in opposition to left peak which contains ordered behaviour events of fade - out .",
    "these two peaks and a pass between them will be the main theme of investigation of this paper .",
    "however , there is also the @xmath1 parameter ( number of nodes ) whose changes were not discussed in ref .",
    "the values used were high @xmath1=2000 and @xmath1=3000 and for used parameters ( @xmath28 ) the results are practically identical . for small values of @xmath1 damage has no space to convert itself into an avalanche and chaotic features can not express . between such small and high values of @xmath1 a threshold of chaos must appear and this is the theme of this paper . as it will be shown , for @xmath3 and @xmath29 the threshold appears for about @xmath1=1200 for @xmath7 and @xmath1=300 for @xmath19 , but @xmath1=4000 is too few for @xmath6 . in ref .",
    "@xcite maximal @xmath1 for @xmath29 is 150 , far from threshold even for @xmath19 .",
    "our threshold is different than the one considered in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath2 for crbn ( @xmath19 ) or found in ref .",
    "@xcite in range @xmath30 for sfrbn .",
    "the specific case @xmath3 @xmath31 ( excluded above ) can not be simulated using special simplified algorithm prepared for investigations of chaotic networks developed in ref .",
    "@xcite and here .",
    "the same simplified algorithm dedicated for simulation of statistical damage spreading and described in details in ref .",
    "@xcite will be used in current paper .",
    "two important notions resulting from the algorithm definition should be reminded - ` real- ' and ` pseudo - fadeout ' of damage .",
    "pseudo - fadeout corresponds to reaching of an equilibrium level of damage .",
    "process ends because damaged node is calculated only one time . in the classic approach starting from @xcite the length and number of circular attractors",
    "are investigated .",
    "they are interpreted e.g. as cell types .",
    "the described simplified algorithm is designed to omit the problem of circular attractors and allows to define fitness on network outputs ( see next chapter ) . in the full quenched model such a particular output does not exist and fitness should be defined on the attractors of outputs , however , the problem of fitness appears only for target structural tendencies .",
    "now , in a middle step , only damage size @xmath32 on outputs will be defined using this algorithm feature . the length and number of circular attractors",
    "are connected to the equilibrium level of damage in some unknown way and are not investigated directly in described simulations .",
    "the basic conclusion of simulation made in ref .",
    "@xcite which is important for our discussion was the indication of distribution @xmath33 where @xmath13 is a damage size ( - number of damaged nodes divided by @xmath1 - number of all nodes ) when damage fades out ( independently of the way of fadeout ) . in this distribution",
    "there are two peaks ; one near zero containing real fadeout and second on the right ( mentioned above ) containing pseudo - fadeout which describes the equilibrium level of damage .",
    "the existence of this right peak is a feature of chaotic network .",
    "the algorithm gives correct statistical values in such a case , however we are interested in the earlier period - in appearance of chaos and this second peak .",
    "this area is depicted using this algorithm with some expected inaccuracy , but the threshold of chaos should be also a threshold of fully correct effects .",
    "for our mostly qualitative discussion in this area such inaccuracy in not important but should be remembered . for simulation in ref .",
    "@xcite and in current paper particular functions are not used , such simplification is useful for statistical summarising and averaging of results . however , in later investigation of structural tendencies functions are necessary .",
    "simplification removes certain elements of : ` deterministic ' and ` quenched ' features of simulated model , however , it does not reach the ` annealed ' level .",
    "later there will be used a case where structure of connection of node is stable but all states of nodes are randomly changed - looks like ` reversed - annealed ' case and from this our algorithm takes the name .    other conclusion from simulations described in ref .",
    "@xcite useful for current discussion is the sequence of network types in degree of chaos @xmath15 for the same parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 which is shown in fig.6 in ref .",
    "@xcite ( however , in parameter @xmath34 - degree of order ) .",
    "these investigations are expanded in ch.4.2 ( see fig.5).the less chaotic @xmath16 is @xmath6 , which is also concluded by @xcite .",
    "it is because small a part of nodes ( named hubs ) collects the major part of links which leads to much smaller local coefficient @xmath18 for the remaining part of nodes which defines this area as ordered .",
    "consequently , damage often really fades out before it reach the first hub which can help it to explode and convert into avalanche .",
    "more chaotic @xmath16 is @xmath7 , then @xmath19 , but only the @xmath19 network contains nodes with @xmath5 , which have strong influence on network behaviour .",
    "on the ` chaotic ' end of kauffman networks there is the @xmath23 network .",
    "only @xmath22 network is more chaotic than @xmath23 in this method of measurement of chaos .",
    "following ref . @xcite the size of damage @xmath36 is measured as the fraction of nodes with damaged output state in the all nodes of system .",
    "this parameter , however , is typically hard to observe for real systems .",
    "adaptation process concerns interactions between system and its environment .",
    "if we are going to describe such a process , then damage should be observed outside the system , on its external outputs .",
    "however , network with outputs is no longer an autonomous network like the ones considered from ref .",
    "@xcite up till ref . @xcite .",
    "some links are special - they are connected to environment which is another , special ` node ' which does not transmit damage ( in the first approximation ) unlike all the remaining ones .",
    "damage fades out on the outputs like on a node with @xmath5 , therefore the dynamics of damage @xmath13 should be a little bit different depending on the proportion of output size and network size .",
    "environment as an objectively special node can be used for the indication of nodes place in a network , which without such special node generally have no objective point of reference .",
    "the main task of this special node in adaptation process is a fitness calculation and darwinian elimination of some network changes .",
    "the simplest definition of damage size on system outputs is : the number @xmath32 of damaged output signals . for large networks with feedbacks it is applicable only using a simplified algorithm described in ref .",
    "it omits the problem of circular attractors .",
    "formally , @xmath32 is a hamming distance of system output signal vectors between a control system and a damaged one . practically , using our algorithm",
    ", it is distance between system output before and after damage simulation . for simulations the system has a fixed number @xmath37 of output signals which means that @xmath38 .",
    "we can expect , that distributions @xmath39 and @xmath40 should be similar .",
    "in fact , asymptotic values ( for ` matured systems ' ) : @xmath41 of @xmath13 and @xmath42 of @xmath32 are simply connected : @xmath43 but such a connection is not true for smaller systems and @xmath32 is smaller than expected .",
    "note , that number of output signals @xmath35 is constant and much smaller than the growing number @xmath1 of nodes in the network , which must influence on the statistical parameters and their precision .       and @xmath23 ( 1 ) , @xmath44 and @xmath7 network ( 2 ) depicted for @xmath2 . in case of addition of a new node to the network , links @xmath45 and @xmath46 are drawn .",
    "node @xmath47 is drawn instead of link @xmath46 for @xmath7 and @xmath9 . for @xmath48 additional inputs",
    "are constructed like the right ones .",
    "the @xmath23 network is maintained as @xmath22 but there is only one , common output signal @xmath15 .",
    "an extension in comparison to fig.3 in ref .",
    "@xcite is removal of node which only needs a draw of a node to remove .",
    "main moves are the same as for addition but in opposite sequence , however events which occur after the addition change situation for @xmath7 and @xmath6 .",
    "removal can create case @xmath5 : node added on link @xmath49 remains a @xmath5 node while removing .",
    "the outgoing links , which were added after addition of this node to the network , are moved to the start node of link @xmath45 .",
    "this lack of symmetry causes changes in distributions @xmath4 and other features of a network , therefore networks @xmath6 and @xmath7 with removals of node are different than without and are named @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively.,width=302 ]    in the ch.3.3 in ref .",
    "@xcite the importance of fraction of nodes with @xmath50 for level of chaos was discussed . in the @xmath6 and @xmath7 networks which are built using only additions of nodes , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , only @xmath51 can be found in range @xmath50 ( i.e. no node has @xmath5 ) . in the @xmath19 network",
    "@xmath5 also appears and this leads to different behaviour .",
    "however , in the target model of adaptive evolution and structural tendencies using only addition of node during network grow will be insufficient , there also removing of nodes is needed .",
    "random removal of a node needs to draw a node only from the nodes constituting the network ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "each node should have equal probability to be chosen .",
    "pattern of disconnection of node should be the same but in opposite direction to connection when adding , however , if removing happens not directly after addition , situation can change and such simple assumption will be insufficient .",
    "such a case appears for @xmath6 and @xmath7 networks when @xmath12 of removed node can be different than - just after addition and , which is especially interesting , when on the right input link a new node was added . during the removal , this new",
    "node loses its output link and may become a @xmath5 node .",
    "nodes with @xmath5 and other nodes connected to them , which have no way to external outputs are called ` blind ' nodes .",
    "the existence of ` blind ' nodes in the network is one of the biggest and the most interesting problems especially for the modelling of adaptation .",
    "the importance and complexity of this problem is similar to the problem of feedbacks .",
    "the set of investigated networks in the step described in this paper leading to structural tendencies should contain networks built with removing of nodes , which means @xmath6 and @xmath7 should contain @xmath5 .",
    "such networks are different than the typical @xmath6 and @xmath7 , also because removals change node degree distribution , therefore networks built with 30% of removals of nodes and 70% of additions get other names - @xmath8 for modified @xmath6 and @xmath9 for @xmath7 with removals .",

    "results of a few networks with the same parameters are summarised . in effect",
    "of such a method a number of events for a small @xmath1 will be much smaller than for last ( far greater ) values .",

    "this observation we will discuss first , because its cause is clear .",
    "each particular network has its own particular individual structure which should cause a deviation from the average behaviour .    to check this hypothesis of cause of observed peak deformation",

    "a question appears : are these structural features , which cause the observed deviations , stable during next levels @xmath1 of network growth ?",

    "indeed , such a stability appears typically and the distances of peak maxims are larger than the standard deviation of peaks for one network .",
    "as can be observed in fig.6.2 , the peaks width is small ( because @xmath10=16 is large ) and the distance between peaks is larger which is a basic cause of visible deformation in fig.6.1 for last @xmath1 . to estimate the influence of this individual deviation of structure on the total peak width an average standard deviation for one network peak was measured and compared to the standard deviation of total peak for many networks as depicted in fig.2 . for network @xmath23 in both : @xmath13 and @xmath32",

    "these differences relatively and absolutely are the biggest for @xmath8 16,3 .    if we assume that each node or output signal has equal probability to be damaged and we use as this probability theoretical @xmath13 ( ch.2 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) or the @xmath13 obtained in simulation , then the right peak is described by a binomial distribution with known parameters . we can then compare its standard deviation to the one obtained in simulation experiment .",
    "such simple model works too well - for @xmath32 experimental data are in range of error ( 10% ) but for @xmath63 and @xmath29 obtained standard deviation is a little bit lower than theoretical .",

    "this discrepancy grows for more chaotic networks and reaches 4 times higher value for @xmath8 4,2 . for these comparisons only @xmath59 and @xmath10=16 were used because for lower @xmath10 the errors in data are too large .    in conclusion -",
    "the wideness of right peak has two known causes .",
    "the first one is theoretical and results from @xmath35 or @xmath1 parameter and the equilibrium level of damage which depend on @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "this first cause does not depend on the number of experimental events and is a feature of the network case ( combination of @xmath16 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) .",
    "this aspect can be used for theoretical approximation of slope of probability in area of ` zero occurrence ' .",
    "the second cause is the individual structure of particular networks , it can be minimized using more networks for determining the maximum point .",
    "the above analysis suggests that for more chaotic networks ( which in this article were given names starting from letter ` @xmath10 ' ) there is some significant unknown mechanism of dispersion .",
    "the above simple theory does not explain the observed dependency on @xmath11 for damage type @xmath13 . for damage type @xmath32 ( which should be an effect of @xmath13 ) it probably covers more complex dependencies .",
    "full information for analysis is contained in fig.3 - 5 , 7 .",
    "there are collected equilibrium levels of damage size measured in @xmath13 ( fig.3 ) and in @xmath32 ( fig.4 ) for different network sizes @xmath1 and parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",

    "these three pictures are similar .",
    "appearances of zero typically occur for @xmath13 and @xmath32 close to each other , separated by one step of @xmath1 therefore it can be treated as one criterion of chaos",
    ". however it also happens , e.g. for @xmath9 4,4 , that the occurrences are further away from each other . for @xmath32 one zero case was enough to indicate zero appearance but for @xmath13 5 cases of zero was used ( fewer than 5 zero cases were neglected ) .",
    "the steps of @xmath1 are too large to determine this place exactly but obtained data are enough for analysis .",
    "for set of networks @xmath16 with the same combination @xmath54 , the lines of zero appearance are typically sloped .",
    "it means that there are no coincidences between the criteria 80% of lmx or 90% of dmx and these criteria of chaos threshold give different results .",
    "looking through the full set of data in form of fig.2 we can conclude that appearance of zero looks correctly in any case : the right peak is never too small and always has a ` matured ' symmetrical shape .",
    "criteria based on the certain fraction of asymptotical value of damage equilibrium have a convincing definition and indicated point with error which can be determined , however they do not work in accordance with the level of visual ` maturation ' stage of network . for smaller @xmath10 and more chaotic network ,",
    "e.g. @xmath23 2,3 or 2,4 or even 3,2 ( fig.3 crossing of 90%@xmath41 or fig.4 - 80%@xmath42 ) the right peak is small ( fig.2 @xmath68 ) and between peaks there is only a shallow pass whereas less chaotic networks are typically ( fig.3 and 4 ) even for @xmath1=4000 out of this criterion as not chaotic , however , they often ( even @xmath8 4,2 in fig.2 ) have a ` matured ' shape and zero between peaks in this point .",
    "this unexpected conclusion is explained in fig.5 where the degree of chaos @xmath15 measured as part of events in the right peak is depicted .",
    "` less chaotic networks ' by fraction of asymptotical value indeed typically have significantly lower @xmath15 .",
    "it suggests that a large part of each of these networks is ordered , but the chaotic part of network is ` matured ' and avalanche of damage in this part realises most of its growth potential .",
    "it means , that for such an avalanche the effective network size is smaller .",
    "if we depict the distance to asymptote ( @xmath41 or @xmath42 also in approximation for @xmath67 ) in log - log diagram , then we obtain straight lines .",
    "they depict ` finite size effects ' .",
    "it indicates that these relationships are scale - free and we can not expect in them any special values of n. particular point of assumed exactness is a point of practical approximation , not a physical phenomenon , however , real phenomenon of sought ` complexity threshold ' exist and a method to describe it should be found .",
    "such assumed exactness does not seem satisfactory .    for degree of chaos @xmath67 distance to asymptote on log - log chart",
    "is nearly straight but getting a bit convex .",
    "if we neglect the first few points about which we know that they are not sufficiently precise due to algorithm features , it gets straighter . assuming that the relationship is linear , we obtain an asymptote which can only lie too high .",
    "these asymptotes are individual for each particular parameter vector @xmath28 , they are shown in fig.5 in black horizontal lines .",
    "they mean that even a very large network is not lacking an ordered behaviour which occurs in even high faction of damage initiations .",
    "classic derrida annealed approximation neglects this important feature .",
    "second conclusion is that @xmath16 of network is a crucial parameter defining degree of chaos of large networks .",
    "such a view is in accordance with differences of @xmath6 and @xmath8 network or @xmath7 and @xmath9 - nodes with @xmath5 moves them to lower degree of chaos in similar way as nodes with @xmath51 .",
    "the degree of chaos describes the probability that in effect of a damage initiation an avalanche occurs but the equilibrium level of damage size @xmath13 and @xmath32 considers only cases where avalanche actually occurs .    for our task of indicating the maturation point we can remark that zero occurrence is denoted on @xmath67 curves typically on the end of their fast growth where the curve takes a significant turn towards the horizontal direction . on the log - log diagrams of distance @xmath15 to its asymptote lines connecting points of zero occurrence",

    "let s come back to the problem of proper region for adaptive evolution . in ref .",
    "@xcite living systems were shifted into chaotic area , however , they still remain within the boundary of kauffman s liquid region .",
    "there@xcite was considered ` degree of order ' @xmath34 shown in fig.6.2 which equals @xmath69 .",
    "now we have estimated asymptotes for different @xmath70 and @xmath11 and we can try to estimate the boundary of ` liquid region ' in chaotic direction i.e. for higher @xmath54 .",
    "there is not enough data for a more precise approximation , for @xmath71 and 4 there are only 3 points of @xmath11 , but for higher @xmath11 changes of asymptote levels are significantly smaller and we can expect that even for high @xmath11 the ` degree of order ' @xmath34 for @xmath72 is not to be neglected . it can even mean that e.g. for the important @xmath6 network there is no shore in chaotic direction .",
    "i think that a practical shore exist , but adaptive evolution has its region of real @xmath73 even for highly chaotic networks ( chaotic in other sense than @xmath15 ) .      here",
    "i must stress important interpretational reason : in this paper adaptive process is not assumed , however , applications of this investigations for living objects are planned .",
    "splitting a set of effects of small disturbance into only two subsets - real ( random ) fadeout and damage avalanche ending in equilibrium is a large simplification for living objects .",
    "adaptive evolution collecting ` biological information ' , whatever it means in details , chooses special networks which are called ` homeostatic ' .",
    "this important term is used in literature in different meaning : usually it means negative feedbacks which keep system in a particular range with respect to many parameters .",
    "such features were named ` ultrastability ' by @xcite probably follow ashby .",
    "lots of such mechanisms are typically met in living objects .",
    "life is often saw as a process of collecting negative feedbacks e.g.@xcite .",
    "it is probably an overestimation of this aspect , however , the condensation of negative feedbacks in living objects is extremely high on all levels of their structure and function .",
    "this concentration is an effect of the pressure of the adaptive condition . in our simulation",
    "there is no such pressure and no its effects .",
    "our model is far too simple to investigate an appearance of homeostatic mechanisms .",
    "however , for such a ` abstractive ' more adequate model if there were such a pressure , then we should observe a very large and important fraction of events with initial small ` semi - random ' disturbance , when the damage later fades out because such homeostatic mechanisms keep control of it .",
    "such disturbances are ` semi - random ' because the system met them earlier during the adaptive evolution and ` knows ' a method to prevent their effects .",
    "( more exactly - not a system understood as all its ancestors met such reasons but sisters of these ancestors which are eliminated . )",
    "grns - gene regulatory networks based on @xcite work are such more adequate models , where negative feedbacks emerge .",
    "there are feedbacks in our networks , but they are random and they do not perform homeostatic functions which can only be an effect of the adaptive condition . from the outside of the system , the effect of homeostatic mechanism seems to be similar to real fadeout , however , the latter one is only a random effect and our estimation of its frequency is based on such assumption ( that is random , homeostatic reaction is not a random ) .",
    "@xcite uses the term ` homeostatic ' in a different meaning : his ` homeostatic stability ' is a spontaneous resistance of system to disturbance which is a property of ` ordered ' type of system .",
    "adaptation founds such system type which is the main effect of adaptation for kauffman .",
    "this is the essence of his ` life on the edge of chaos ' concept .",
    "damage avalanches on great scale are impossible in ordered systems , they should quickly really fade out or stay on a low level of equilibrium .",
    "it is exactly these properties that we investigate in our simulations , however , i believe that the main effect of adaptive evolution is not the kaffman s ` homeostatic stability ' but the negative feedbacks .",
    "kauffman s gene regulatory model @xcite works mostly in ordered regime .",
    "this model fits the experimental data well @xcite and has become a strange exception from my general estimation that living objects are chaotic , however , it does not model homeostasis based on negative feedbacks ( which covers majority of observed biological stability as i estimate above ) .    if we go this far into interpretation , then the other similar aspects should be also raised for completeness .",
    "damage avalanche may have only one interpretation for living objects - it is death and elimination .",
    "therefore their adaptive evolution can only be based on those random changes , whose initiated damage either really fades - out , in range of cases investigated here , or is neutralized using a homeostatic feature , but they are out of the scope of cases examined here . if we neglect such an important and large part of mechanisms and cases connected to them , then are these investigation adequate for the description of living objects ? - yes and no . ` yes ' , because we investigate a part of a set of mechanisms which work in networks describing living objects .",
    "` no ' in these problems in which we are going to conclude that we have found all main causes or mechanisms of some phenomena - for these rest of problems we should investigate the part neglected here .",

    "( for @xmath22 network @xmath16 it is not one , but it is understandable for this case - @xmath13 is higher because node output states are @xmath11-dimensional . ) it means that certain phenomena of small network should not be neglected even for @xmath1=4000 for networks whose names ( in our terminology ) start with ` @xmath10 ' ( @xmath7 , @xmath9 , @xmath6 , @xmath8 ) .",
    "the networks in this set are more important because of their applications .",
    "they have a rule of growth which leads to creation of hubs - forming the long tail of node degree distribution , and to large probability of @xmath50 .",
    "the remaining considered types of network @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath19 are useful mainly for the detection of causes of observed phenomena because of their small ( @xmath19 ) - or lack ( @xmath23 , @xmath22 ) of dispersion in node degree distribution or higher damage dynamics for @xmath22 @xmath16 .",
    "it is interesting that in fig.7 the curves for @xmath7 and @xmath6 are typically identical ( except the very beginning ) but @xmath9 and @xmath8 are different . here",
    "the curve for @xmath9 network @xmath16 is extremely low and flat which is difficult to understand . without explanation of this effect",
    "we are unable to assess the meaning of zero appearance ( appearance of an area with zero ) for @xmath9 network . for small @xmath11 and remaining network types",
    "the ` zero appearance ' well indicates the beginning of area in which small network effects can be neglected .",
    "however , for larger @xmath11 we observe lower curves except for @xmath23 and @xmath22 where the curve moves little bit up as @xmath11 grows , and for networks : @xmath7 , @xmath6 , @xmath8 and @xmath71 & 4 , @xmath63 & 4 , even @xmath19 4,4 zero appears too early .    summarising the search for criteria described in chapter 4",
    ", the best candidate seems to be the criterion using ` appearance of zero ' , however , it works correctly only for networks with feedbacks , which will be developed in the next chapter .",
    "term ` zero appearance ' as well as exactness level allowing to neglect small network effects should be treated as symbols of wide set of more exactly defined criterions based on these phenomena .",
    "it can e.g. be an appearance of value equal certain small fraction of right peak height between peaks of normalized distribution . to this can be added requirements of range of such appearance , e.g. number of points or fraction of damage range .",
    "always , however , we must arbitrary chose certain value which makes our threshold not fully objective .",
    "it is not a useful and nice criterion but we find that in investigated range there is no better one . in effect",
    "we never obtain an objective point criterion but fuzzy set of such points .",
    "particular point criterion can be defined for particular necessities and we do nt developed them here .",
    "two separated peaks , one for real fade out and second for pseudo fade out are an assumption of the simplified algorithm used for simulation in ref .",
    "@xcite and in this paper .",
    "using this algorithm we investigate these two peaks and the appearance of the right one .",
    "is nt it a tautology ?",
    "no , however , in the area where second peak emerges this algorithm is not clear and may not produce exactly correct effects .",
    "such effects have no clear interpretation .",
    "therefore it is desirable to model this area in another way to understand why we should expect two peaks and why they are not present from the beginning .",
    "percolation theory is a known theory which explain these two peaks .",
    "another way for intuition for different point of view and different aspects will be shown here .",
    "network , cone of influence , functional order , terms : early , late and terminal , levels and depth and their relations.,width=332 ]    let us start from the extremely simple network depicted in fig.8 .",
    "imagine that there are 32 nodes in each level .",
    "each node has two inputs and two outputs like @xmath22 network for @xmath2 .",
    "nodes from one level are connected to higher level nodes in an extremely ordered way depicted in the figure . to eliminate boundaries on the left and",
    "right they create a cylinder .",
    "network ends at the top in external outputs of network which send signals to the environment as a result of network function .",
    "let us name this network ` @xmath76 ' - ` l ' because it has clear levels and ` @xmath18 ' because this letter is similar to the connection pattern .",
    "the @xmath76 network does not contain feedbacks , it is probably the most ordered one in the sense of simplicity of connection pattern which requires an extremely small amount information for its description . only for a similarly simple network can one draw on paper a ` cone of influence ' of a given node .",
    "the cone contains in its ` later ' part all nodes which can be damaged if the given one is damaged .",
    "arrows depict the direction of signal flow - it is a directed and functioning network like all the networks of our interest ( rsn ) in this paper and the previous one @xcite . in such a case information in form of signals flows up from the bottom - this is functional order ( or sequence ) which defines terms ` early ' , ` later ' and ` terminal ' ( closely near outputs , at the end of signal path ) .",
    "similar phenomenon named ` supremacy ' is investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite in more theoretical way for directed scale - free network .",
    "levels can be numbered starting from an indicated node , however , nodes are similar and such a method is not stable and not objective .",
    "it can be substituted by a numbering which starts from the stable outputs therefore such numbering is a depth measure - it is a useful structural substitution of the functional sequence . for a cone of influence",
    "it is the height which affects the number of outputs which can be reached by damage initialised in the vertex of the cone .",
    "not all of the later nodes and network outputs will be damaged - the density of filling the cone by damage depends on the coefficient @xmath77 of damage propagation described in ref .",
    "@xcite and mentioned in ch.2.2 .",
    "if @xmath78 and damage does not fade out in the first few steps , then it also becomes a cone and is greater for greater cone height .",
    "let us investigate distribution of number @xmath32 of damaged output signals in dependency on depth @xmath80 .",
    "as an equivalent of using the depth @xmath80 for the real network outputs we watch the sets of node outputs in consecutive higher levels ( numbered by @xmath81 ) from initiation of damage . in fig.9.1",
    "this process is shown for @xmath59 , but levels are numbered with @xmath82 - number of nodes in levels from initiation of damage . similarly to fig.2 we find here two peaks , zero in - between and the process of emergence of right peak , however , it does not yet correspond with fig.2 . to obtain the same meaning as in fig.2 we must define the height of full network ( which we can assume to be equal to @xmath81 ) and summarize distributions from all equally probable levels ( from the beginning to the shown one @xmath83 ) .",
    "the result is also shown in fig.9 , but only for two heights @xmath81 of network ( for @xmath84 for @xmath76 or 50,1600 for @xmath79 and 125,4000 for both ) .",
    "now we also find two peaks , but in - between there can not be zero because middle levels exist and were summarized .     for path length - levels ( depth @xmath80 )",
    "are numbered in @xmath85 from damage initiation for ( 1 ) @xmath76 network and ( 2 ) @xmath79 network .",
    "there are two peaks emerging like in fig.2 , however , to obtain the same meaning as in fig.2 , these distributions should be summarized .",
    "effect of this summarizing is shown in additional diagram for @xmath1=1600 and @xmath1=4000 for @xmath76 ( 1 ) and @xmath1=320 and @xmath1=4000 for @xmath79 ( 2 ) .",
    "note that for these networks there are no feedbacks and these distributions can not contain zero in - between peaks.,width=340 ]    let us remove a part of ` order ' from the description of structure - the connection between levels are now random .",
    "we need much more information for the description of such a particular network - it is more complex",
    ". we will use the name ` @xmath79 ' for this network , fig.9.2 shows ( similarly to fig.9.1 ) damage propagation process in consecutive damage size distributions for growing distance from the initiation point . in this case",
    "the right peak reaches its stable position much faster and the transitional stages contribute much less to the sum between peaks .",
    "when @xmath10 grows , e.g. two times from 4 to 8 then the effect is similar to an increase of complexity - we need to know more to describe particular network with states and the right peak reaches a stable position two times faster .",
    "now we should discuss the network case with feedbacks .",
    "there appears a question : how deep is a particular place of damage initiation in such a network ?",
    "this question can be translated into a question about the length of path from initiation point to outputs , however , in opposite to networks @xmath76 and @xmath79 such paths may be very different .",
    "they may be different for two reasons , first , because clear levels used in @xmath76 and @xmath79 are a strong assumption which must not be taken even for network without feedbacks , e.g. for @xmath86 network described in ref .",
    "@xcite , second , because feedbacks make such a measure undefined .",
    "feedbacks are the loops in which signals can loop any times up to infinity therefore there is no the longest path , but the shortest path , which is only defined , is not well adequate . in a typical randomly constructed network there are lot of feedbacks , they are a cause of damage equilibrium state which should remain stable ad infinity .",
    "if damage passes the first period when it is small and has real probability of fade out , then it reaches the feedbacks loops and its path through network will be infinite - it correspond to an infinite depth of initiation , however , outputs may also be reached fast . therefore in a network with feedbacks there are no middle paths and middle damage sizes placed between peaks and in this area there occurs zero frequency .",
    "this zero means that the network is so large that feedbacks are reached quickly ( after a short way , frequently ) enough that middle ways can not happen .    for a network without feedbacks there",
    "remains the criterion of stable position of right peak and for practice some percent of asymptotical level should be used , however , a large flat area between peaks of small value of probability in comparison to the right peak may be taken as good approximation of zero occurrence .",
    "we are looking for complexity threshold during growth of kauffman and similar networks defined as rsn @xcite ( random , equally probable signal variants network ) .",
    "an important parameter @xmath10 ( number of equally probable signal variants ) was introduced in the definition of rsn as an exclusive alternative to bias @xmath87 ( probability of one of signal variants ) .",
    "we concern ourselves with an expectation ( based on interpretation ) that complexity is connected to the necessity of lots of information for prediction .",
    "this leads us to the investigation of level of chaos in different aspects and to observations of a maturation process in which properties of small networks ( finite size effects ) disappear .",
    "our complex network is therefore a network so large that for assumed parameters : @xmath16 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 it exhibits chaotic features where properties of small network can be neglected .",
    "however , when and which effects can be neglected depends on lots of reasons , and among them - on our intention as well . in order to target the application ( structural tendencies ) of these partial investigations we are going to observe the external outputs of network , however ,",
    "we do not limit ourselves to the output .",
    "the main starting observation is the distribution of damage size @xmath13 ( damaged part of nodes constituting network ) or @xmath32 ( number of damaged outputs of @xmath35=64 all outputs ) after a small damage initiation for different network sizes @xmath1 ( from 50 to 4000 nodes ) and for different other network parameters : @xmath16 ( kauffman networks : @xmath8 - scale - free with 30% node removing , @xmath6 - scale - free without node removing , @xmath9 - single - scale with 30% node removing , @xmath7- single - scale without node removing , @xmath19 - erds - rnyi random network , @xmath23 - fixed @xmath24 ; not kauffman network : @xmath22 - aggregate of automata i.e. fixed @xmath24 and @xmath12-dimensional output state - each output of one node has its own signal ) , @xmath10 ( number of signal variants : 2,3,4,16 ) and @xmath11 ( fixed number of node inputs : 2,3,4 ) . see fig.2 .",
    "after the initiation damage may fade out ( which is an ordered behaviour ) and create the left peak on above distribution , or the damage may reach an equilibrium level which is a chaotic behaviour and creates the right peak ( large percolating cluster ) . the fraction of damage initiation events which exhibit such chaotic behaviour is treated as degree @xmath15 of chaos .",
    "this is the first parameter with which maturation is observed .",
    "the ` chaotic ' cases from right peak reach the equilibrium level near or far from a theoretical value expected for a large network in derrida annealed model .",
    "this is the second relation with which maturation is observed .",
    "damage @xmath32 observed on the network external outputs is an effect of damage process inside the network described by @xmath13 , however a simple relation @xmath75 appears only for large networks and this is the third relation with which maturation is observed .",
    "each of these three relations seems to be differently dependent on the observed parameters in detail but generally they give similar conclusions .",
    "differences in these relations behaviour suggest that these are at least three different mechanisms .",
    "two practical criterion types of maturity threshold were discussed : the first one based on the degree of nearness to the known asymptote - e.g. level of damage size equilibrium for a large network , and the second one based on the observed phenomenon of zero appearance between peaks in distribution of frequency of damage size reached after initiation .",
    "the former one has a clear interpretation , corresponding well to the disappearance of small network effects , however , it does not well correspond to the qualitative view of maturation of base distribution depicted in fig.2 .",
    "the best found candidate seems to be the criterion using appearance of zero , however , it depends a little on event number and works correctly only for networks with feedbacks . for a network without feedbacks ( which is a strange case )",
    "it can be used with approximation . however , both found types of criterion - first , termed ` exactness level ' , allowing to neglect small network effects , and second - ` zero appearance ' should be treated as symbols of wide set of more exactly defined criterions based on these phenomena .",
    "they can be defined for particular necessities and are not developed here .",
    "maturation of network during growth concerns a few ( at least three ) different phenomena which in different ways depend on the network @xmath16 and parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "most of them wait a theoretical description and explanation .",
    "in such a case one criterion for maturation threshold is a simplification which can not work well for all cases .",
    "the appearance of zero is shown in fig.3 - 5 , 7 using lines connecting points for different network types .",
    "these lines are generally sloped down to the right which means that this criterion decides the threshold earlier for less chaotic network types than the first type of criteria .",
    "however , such decision corresponds well to the wide qualitative view , which , unfortunately , is not well defined . also unfortunately , the less chaotic network types @xmath8 and @xmath6 are the most attractive for applications .",
    "this criterion corresponds well to the term ` complex network ' , which is very often used , typically in such an intuitive meaning , but not well defined .",
    "it is obvious that such a definition , concerning only chaotic network , is not applicable for all cases , but , i hope , it is useful and may be checked in practice .    in comparison to the main stream of investigation of transition to chaos which concerns the exact ` edge of chaos ' ( @xmath31 , @xmath3 ) and number and length of attractors this approach moves into area known as chaotic ( @xmath88 , @xmath0 without the case @xmath89 ) and",
    "reaches much higher network sizes ( @xmath90 even for @xmath91 and 16,3 ) . in this area other transition to ` matured ' chaos and its threshold is investigated . in the main investigated distribution + @xmath92 or @xmath93 the shape containing two peaks and minimum up to zero between them , width , interpretation and position of these peaks",
    "are explained , however lots of details still await explanation .    also in comparison to the main stream ,",
    "living systems are shifted follow ref.@xcite to ` matured chaos ' onto opposite shore of kauffman s liquid region near ` edge of chaos ' .",
    "role of negative feedbacks is stressed in stability of living objects .    by the way some simplifications were used and checked which the reader may be interested in .",
    "e.g. in additions to the earlier described algorithm a process which i called reversed - annealed approximation was used to check structure influence : the node connection in network was kept ( we do not use a particular function ) but all node states were randomly changed .",
