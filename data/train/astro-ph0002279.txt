    "this band provides an efficient tool to discriminate between accretion - powered sources , like the active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are generally thought to be , and sources dominated by the starlight component .",
    "moreover , hard x  ray selection is less affected by obscuration with respect to other bands , making possible the study of the nuclear continuum without any relevant contamination by reprocessed radiation .",
    "indeed the optical identification process indicates that the large majority of the hellas sources are agn ( la franca et al .",
    ", in preparation ) . among these",
    ", saxj  1353.9@xmath01820 can be considered one of the most intriguing sources .",
    "after its discovery in the context of the hellas survey , it was spectroscopically identified as a radio - quiet agn at a redshift of 0.2166 ( fiore et al .",
    "its optical spectrum is dominated by starlight , as the presence of h and k plus mg  i absorption lines clearly indicates . the h@xmath7 equivalent width ( about 90 @xmath8 ) , the absence of the h@xmath9 and the _ bepposax _ hardness ratio are suggestive of significant reddening of the nuclear radiation .",
    "the hard x  ray luminosity , l@xmath10 @xmath2 1.4 @xmath11 10@xmath3 erg s@xmath4 , the presence of a broad balmer line and the optical spectrum properties allow to classify this object as a fairly low - luminosity , red quasar . + this class of objects , originally discovered in radio  selected samples ( smith & spinrad 1980 ) , is characterized by red optical colours ( @xmath12 up to 8 , webster et al .",
    "1995 ) . on the basis of",
    "_ rosat _ pspc observations and optical spectroscopy kim & elvis ( 1999 ) pointed out that a significant fraction ( from a few percent up to 20 per cent ) of soft x  ray selected radio ",
    "quiet quasars belong to this class .",
    "the origin of the observed ` redness ' may be ascribed to dust absorption , to intrinsic red colours ( @xmath13 70 per cent of the red sources of the parkes sample has @xmath14 30 per cent of contribution to b ",
    "k by their host galaxies , masci et al .",
    "1998 ) or to an excess of light in k band rather than a dust - induced deficit in b ( benn et al . 1998 ) . whatever is the origin of the red colours , it is likely that a large fraction of quasars could have been missed by the usual selection techniques in the optical band ( webster et al . 1995 ) .",
    "if this is the case , red quasars could constitute a sizeable fraction of the absorbed agn population needed to explain the hard x  ray background spectrum ( i.e. comastri et al . 1995 ) especially if the optical reddening is associated with x  ray absorption .",
    "hard x  ray observations provide the most efficient way to select these objects ; indeed already two candidates have been found among the first optical identifications of hellas sources ( fiore et al .",
    "1999 ) . in order to better understand the spectral properties of these objects we have started a program of multiwavelength follow  up observations of a sub  sample of hellas sources . here",
    "we present the first results obtained in the x  ray band with _",
    "asca _ and at optical  infrared wavelengths with the 3.5-m italian national telescope galileo ( tng ) at la palma ( oig and arnica photometric cameras ) .",

    "the observation was performed in faint mode and then corrected for dark frame error and echo uncertainties ( otani & dotani 1994 ) .",
    "the data were screened with the xselect package ( version 1.4b ) with standard criteria .",

    "calibration uncertainties in the soft x  ray band have been avoided by selecting only data at energies higher than 0.9 kev .",
    "no discrepancies have been found between sis and gis spectral analysis , therefore all the data have been fitted together allowing the relative normalizations to be free of varying .",

    "subtracted frames were then flat  fielded using sky flats .",
    "the cosmic rays of the ccd region around the target have been interactively identified and removed by fitting of the neighbouring pixels .",
    "the photometry has been performed using apphot , the aperture photometry package available in iraf .",
    "the object is clearly extended , and we used a quite large aperture radius ( @xmath2 8  arcsec ) for all the bands , corresponding to a projected distance of about 15 @xmath43  kpc at the redshift of saxj  1353.9 + 1820 .",
    "measurements in the j and k - short bands were also made with the arnica instrument at the same telescope within the framework of a wider near  ir follow - up of the hellas sources .",
    "the data reduction and analysis of the near  ir data will be discussed in detail in maiolino et al .",
    "( in preparation ) , here we simply report the resulting photometry .",
    "the results of the combined aperture photometry are presented in table  2 .",
    "the surface brightness ( sb ) profiles in the u , b , v , r and i filters have been estimated computing a curve of growth for each passband with increasing circular apertures ( fig .  3 )",
    ". an effective radius of @xmath2  1.5 arcsec was indipendently derived from all but one fits ( for the i  band we obtained a slightly more concentrated profile ) .",
    "the dashed line in figure represents the @xmath44 law , which fits very well the observed profiles outside of the seeing - dominated region down to the faintest flux levels .",
    "the sb profiles are typical for elliptical galaxies suggesting that at optical wavelengths there is no evidence of an unresolved nucleus in saxj  1353.9@xmath01820 .",

    "the _ asca _ observation confirms the presence of a bright and moderately absorbed ( @xmath25 @xmath2 6 @xmath11 10@xmath33 @xmath6 ) nucleus with a flat hard x  ray spectrum , in agreement with the bepposax hardness ratio analysis .",
    "assuming for the underlying continuum slope the average value of quasars in the same energy range , the absorption column density could be as high as @xmath25 @xmath2 3 @xmath11 10@xmath5 @xmath6 if some 20 per cent of the nuclear radiation is not absorbed .",
    "even if the x  ray data alone does not allow to distinguish between the two possibilities , we can safely conclude that saxj  1353.9@xmath01820 harbours a mildly obscured , luminous ( l@xmath45 @xmath26 1.3 @xmath11 10@xmath3 erg s@xmath4 ) active nucleus .",
    "not surprisingly high energy observations of quasars characterized by similar dust reddened optical continua do reveal the presence of absorption by cold ( iras 23060 + 0505 , brandt et al .",
    "1997a ) and/or warm ( iras 13349 + 2438 , brandt et al .",
    "1997b ) gas .",
    "a basic step forward in understanding the nature of this red quasar and of red quasars as a whole , is provided by optical plus near  ir studies ( see maiolino et al .",
    ", in preparation , for further details ) . the surface brightness profiles are consistent with those of an elliptical galaxy , and the optical colours ( u@xmath41b=0.43 , b@xmath41v=1.40 , v@xmath41r=0.83 and r@xmath41i=0.70 ) agree with the properties of a early - type galaxy at @xmath1=0.2 ( fukugita et al",
    ". 1995 ) .    in order to obtain a self  consistent description of the optical - ir properties we fitted the photometric points with a two - components model consisting of an old stellar population template ( 10@xmath46 yr , bruzual & charlot 1993 ) and a moderately absorbed ( @xmath47 2 mag , corresponding to @xmath48 4 @xmath11 10@xmath33 @xmath6 for galactic dust  to  gas ratio , i.e. bohlin , savage & drake 1978 ) quasar spectrum template ( elvis et al . 1994 ; francis et al .",
    "1991 ) . as shown in fig .  4",
    ", the combination of these two spectra provides a good description of the observed data ( possibly with the exception of the j photometry , which deviates by 1.4 sigma ) .",
    "the quality of the fit is acceptable ( @xmath49 = 1.3 when both the uncertainties in the photometric data and in the template spectra are taken into account ) indicating that most of the optical and near  ir flux is dominated by star  light .",
    "the present results add further evidence on the hypothesis of substantial gas and dust absorption as an explanation of the observed properties of this red quasar .",
    "even more interesting is that the active nucleus peers only at x  ray energies and possibly at wavelenghts longward of 2 @xmath50 m ( see fig .",
    "4 ) , while at optical wavelengths saxj  1353.9@xmath01820 looks like a normal evolved elliptical galaxy .",
    "if this behaviour applies also to other objects it may well be that a significant fraction of obscured agns resides in otherwise normal passive galaxies .",
    "these nuclei would have been completely missed in optical quasar surveys because of their extended morphology and galaxy - like colours .",
    "if the column density is of the order of 10@xmath5 @xmath6 or higher , their fraction could be understimated also in soft x  ray surveys .",
    "if this is the case , the fraction of red objects among radio quiet quasars ( @xmath2 320 per cent , kim & elvis 1999 ) should be considered as a lower limit .",
    "this may have strong implications for the xrb synthesis models , which in their simplest version ( i.e. madau , ghisellini & fabian 1994 ; comastri et al .",
    "1995 ) predict a large number of high - luminosity absorbed quasars ( called type 2 qso ) . despite intensive optical searches",
    ", these objects appears to be elusive indicating a much lower space density than that of lower luminosity seyfert 2 galaxies ( halpern , eracleous & forster 1998 ) and calling for a substantial revision of agn synthesis models for the xrb ( gilli , risaliti & salvati 1999 ) .",
    "+ an alternative possibility ( see comastri 2000 ) is that x  ray obscured agn show a large variety of optical properties including those of saxj  1353.9@xmath01820 .",
    "it is worth noting that column densities as high as 10@xmath51 @xmath6 have been detected in broad absorption line qso ( gallagher et al .",
    "1999 ) , in some uv bright soft x  ray weak qso ( brandt et al .",
    "1999 ) , and in a few hellas sources optically identified with broad line blue quasars ( fiore et al . 1999 ) .",
    "it is thus possible that the sources responsible for a large fraction of the xrb energy density are characterized by a large spread in their optical to x  ray properties .",
    "the @xmath52 spectral index , defined as the slope joining the 2500 @xmath8 and the 2 kev flux densities , is usually employed to measure the optical to x  ray ratio .",
    "not surprisingly , absorbed objects are characterized by values of @xmath52 ( @xmath53 1.8 ) much steeper than the average value of bright unabsorbed quasars and seyfert galaxies , @xmath52 @xmath26 1.5 ( laor et al . 1997 ; yuan et al .",
    "1998 ) , while the faint nuclear uv flux density and the relatively bright 2 kev flux of saxj  1353.9@xmath01820 correspond to @xmath52 @xmath26 1 , which is quite flat but not unusual for red quasars ( kim & elvis 1999 ) .    a detailed discussion on the quasars contribution to the xrb is beyond the purposes of this letter .",
    "here we note that as far as the x  ray spectral properties and the bolometric luminosity of @xmath26 10@xmath54 erg s@xmath4 ( estimated using the average sed of elvis et al .",
    "1994 with the measured @xmath52 ) are concerned , saxj  1353@xmath01820 can be classified as a high  luminosity absorbed agn .",
    "future sensitive x ",
    "ray observations with chandra and xmm coupled with optical spectropolarimetry data would be extremely helpful to better understand the nature of red quasars and to estimate their contribution to the xrb .",

    "we are also grateful to _ bepposax _ science data center and to the staff at the national telescope galileo who made possible our observations .",
