    "for positive integers @xmath2 and @xmath3 , what is the minimal length of a word over an alphabet of size @xmath2 which contains every length-@xmath3 word as a subword ?",

    "what is less clear is that for each @xmath7 there are many words which achieve this lower bound .",

    "this sequence has each of the binary palindromes of length 3 as subwords , namely 000 , 010 , 101 , and 111 , but only one member of each of the pairs \\{001 , 100 } and \\{011 , 110}. each non - palindrome of length 3 appears either forwards or backwards exactly once and each palindrome appears exactly once when the sequence is read forwards .",
    "we call such a sequence an _ unoriented de bruijn sequence of optimal length_.    we refer to two words @xmath12 and @xmath13 from an alphabet of size @xmath2 as _ reflections _ or _ reflected pairs _ if @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",

    "an unoriented de bruijn sequence exists for any choice of @xmath2 and @xmath3 since there always exists a word which contains as subwords a member from each of the length-@xmath3 reflections on @xmath2 symbols .",
    "thus there must be a word of minimal length which satisfies this requirement on subwords .",
    "the question becomes whether or not this minimal length is optimal , as it is for de bruijn sequences .",

    "equivalently , when read forward , such a word would contain as length-@xmath3 subwords exactly one member of each reflected pair .",

    "our problem is a variation of the classic , undirected problem because duplicate edges added to @xmath35 must be of the correct type . rather than modifying existing solutions to suit the peculiarities of unoriented de bruijn graphs , we provide an upper bound for the number of duplicate edges needed to eulerize @xmath35 and thereby derive an upper bound for the length of unoriented de bruijn sequences .",
