    "the object of this paper is the study of the behavior of internet traffic , as observed on a network link ( typically shared by a large number of network users ) , aiming to the identification , quantification , and justification of its salient features .",
    "traffic observation here assumes the form of _ data traces _ , i.e. sequences of the form @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a data quantity ( possibly measured in bits , bytes etc . ) , and @xmath2 is its _ time stamp _ , the time when @xmath1 was observed . throughout the paper , though , it will be more convenient to use _ binned _ data traces @xmath3 , with bin size @xmath4 , defined as : @xmath5 .",
    "our ignorance of the exact procedures taking place in the network , due either to their complexity , or to lack of information , as well as of the behavior of its users , forces us to view @xmath6 as a stochastic process @xcite .",
    "this process has been the object of study of numerous researchers .",
    "it has unusual and initially unexpected properties , such as long range dependence @xcite , nonstationarity @xcite , and different behavior on different time scales @xcite .",
    "moreover , even for the coarser time scales , its marginal distributions may be neither gaussian , nor p - stable .",
    "this is all the more surprising , since the central limit theorems would lead one to expect the opposite , because a ) the observed traffic is the aggregate result of many users , possibly acting independently @xcite b ) each @xmath7 is actually the sum of a large number of @xmath1 s , and c ) for small time bins , traffic is uncorrelated .    indeed ,",
    "despite the fact that `` bursts '' and `` spikes '' seem to persist for at least 4 orders of bin magnitude ( fig .",
    "[ traffic9497 ] and [ trafficm6u8 ] ) , which argues against a gaussian limit , it can be easily seen , using classical fitting techniques , that the marginal distributions do not possess the characteristic heavy tails of p - stable variables either ; instead , their tails appear to be exponential or weibull ( fig . [ nogauss ] ) .",
    "thus , the process seems `` unwilling '' to converge to any limit , in contrast to most of the processes observed in nature or industry , which do not exhibit this type of `` wild '' behavior , but rather get `` attracted '' to the ( gaussian or p - stable ) central limit much sooner ( this behavior will be quantified more precisely in section [ modelc ] below ) .    the unusual properties of the traffic are generally attributed to the diversity of user applications , the network protocols , and the complexity of the network topology .",
    "indeed , internet traffic today is a result of numerous applications : e - mail , www , ftp , music and video streams , etc . the duration and the size of the sessions of these applications often vary within several orders of magnitude .",
    "furthermore , the details of the data transfer over the network are regulated by protocols , which control , among other things , the transfer rate at each time instant , and the fragmentation of the data to be transferred into packets .",
    "finally , the transfer rate heavily depends on the state of the network at a particular moment ( link availability , congestion , isp contracts , routing tables , ... ) , which in turn influences ( and is influenced by ) network topology .",
    "the traffic , though , is typically the result of the activity of a large number of network users .",
    "it is expected that many of the features present in each user s own subtraffic will just average out , leaving no trace in the aggregate traffic , whereas others may persist ; it is not obvious , however , whether a particular feature will belong to the former , or the latter category .    to sum up",
    ", it appears there is a consensus about the factors that shape the traffic , as well as about the inadequacy of the gaussian distribution for the description of the shape of the traffic .",
    "this paper explores how different factors affect the traffic .",
    "this necessitates the development of tools that will calibrate the traffic behavior , along with appropriate simulations , on which these tools will be tested .",
    "this section will provide a short description of both real and simulated traces used .",
    "some of the relevant definitions will be given later .",
    "in what follows , eight data sets ( traces ) , coded 89 , 94 , 97 , l4 , l5 , m6 , m7 and u8 will be used systematically .",
    "data sets 89 , 94 , l4 , and l5 are available on the web , at http://ita.ee.lbl.gov/html/traces.html , and data sets m6 , m7 , and u8 are also available on the web , at http://pma.nlanr.net",
    ". these web pages also contain extensive information about the data sets .",
    "more precisely :    * 89 is the trace bcp - aug89 , and it contains `` one million packet arrivals seen on an ethernet at the bellcore morristown research and engineering facility '' .",
    "it was collected on aug 29 , 1989 , starting at 11.25 , and lasts approximately 3,143 seconds .",
    "it is by far the oldest trace used here .",
    "the volume exchanged is approximately 434 mb . *",
    "94 is the trace lbl - tcp-3 , collected on jan 20 , 1994 , between 14.10 and 16.10 .",
    "the volume exchanged is approximately 244 mb .",
    "* l4 is the trace lbl - pkt-4 , collected on jan 28 , 1994 , between 14.00 and 15.00 .",
    "the volume exchanged is approximately 131 mb .",
    "* l5 is the trace lbl - pkt-5 , collected on jan 28 , 1994 , between 15.00 and 16.00 .",
    "the volume exchanged is approximately 94 mb . *",
    "97 contains 1 hour of the total traffic of users subscribing to worldnet via modems , measured at the worldnet gateway , on jul 22 , 1997 , starting at 22.00 , and using a time bin of 1ms .",
    "the volume exchanged is approximately 9 mb .",
    "* m6 is the trace mra-1015686621 - 1 , collected on mar 09 , 2002 .",
    "approximately , it lasts for 81 seconds , and the volume exchanged is 4.8 gb . *",
    "m7 is the trace mra-1015764522 - 1 , collected on mar 10 , 2002 .",
    "approximately , it lasts for 82 seconds , and the volume exchanged is 3.7 gb .",
    "* u8 is the trace odu-1015816310 , collected on mar 11 , 2002 .",
    "approximately , it lasts for 89 seconds , and the volume exchanged is 76 mb .    for data sets 89 and 97 , information on their individual connections",
    "is not available .",
    "the sizes and dates of the traces described span quite a broad range : some of them contain only a few mb of information , whereas others contain 1000 times as much ; some are extrememly recent , whereas others are more than a decade old",
    ". this variety will allow for the examination of the properties of the traffic , and for their validation , in general or specific network conditions .",
    "a set of simulated traces will also be used : 0 - 1 is a self - similar process with continuous on / off intervals ( as in @xcite ) and will be the outcome of model a below ; arr ( standing for arrival process ) takes into account the fragmentation of the information to be transmitted into packets ( model b below ) ; rh ( standing for random heights ) is the reward model , and rh ht ( standing for random heights + heavy tails ) is the @xmath8 traffic model described in @xcite ; arrrh ( standing for arrival process with random heights ) is a combination of rh and arr ; exp iid is a sequence of i.i.d .",
    "exponential variables , and , similarly , ht iid is a sequence of heavy - tailed i.i.d.variables . finally , a model that combines arr with the new idea of `` levels '' , introduced in section [ modeld ] , will also be used ; its simulations will be labeled by the time scales of the levels , and an s will be added if the levels are `` sharp '' , e.g. 8 , 12s , 7s/12/17 etc ( see section [ modeld ] ) .      as a result of the intensive research on internet traffic , many models have been proposed .",
    "a requirement imposed was that they be _ parsimonious _ @xcite : they should use a very limited set of parameters , as opposed to the millions of details present in a real network . in",
    "what follows , some of the most common ones will be presented and discussed .    * the self - similar model ( ssm ) * : this is perhaps the simplest model conceptually .",
    "its main assumption is that each of the @xmath9 users generates a data stream or connection @xmath10 , @xmath11 the traffic being their sum : @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",
    "the users are supposed to act independently , and the data streams are composed of intervals of value @xmath14 ( where the user is silent ) , alternating with intervals of value @xmath15 ( where the user sends data ) , whose lengths are random , independent , and cross - independent .",
    "the degrees of freedom of this model then are just two : the distributions of the lengths of the aforementioned intervals . if chosen appropriately , e.g. _ _ heavy - tailed _ _ distributions are allowed , they can lead to _ self - similar _ simulated traffic @xcite for a more precise statement , see theorem a ( section [ modela ] ) .    the self - similarity of the traffic , and the heavy - tailed distributions of the intervals of silence and/or activity for each user , have been verified in real traces .",
    "the violation of the traditional poisson model @xcite , and the long range dependence , i.e. slowly decaying autocorrelation ( illustrated in fig . [ ac ] and [ acnd ] in section [ modela ] ) , which are both consequences of the heavy tail distributions , are perhaps the most striking results . however , this model is not entirely successful : the traffic it produces is not as `` spiky '' as real traffic ( fig .",
    "[ ssrw ] ) .",
    "moreover , the _ energy function _ , which gives , for each time scale , the contribution of the behavior at that scale to the total energy ( more details in section [ enavdef ] , or @xcite ) , can clearly distinguish between the simulation and the real traffic . for the simulation",
    ", the energy function gives a straight line , whereas the energy function of the real traffic curves ( see fig . [ enold ] below , summarizing the energy for data as well as simulations according to several models ) .",
    "the `` curving of the energy function '' for internet traffic traces has played an important role as a motivation for certain models of internet data traffic , ever since its first observation in @xcite .",
    "it will be used as one of the cornerstones of this work as well . as section [ enavdef ]",
    "will explain , though , a slightly different definition for the energy function than the one in [ enavdef ] will be used ; the energy function herein used is the average of the translation non - invariant concept in [ enavdef ] over all possible choices of the `` origin '' ( @xmath16 plays a special role in [ enavdef ] ) .",
    "this is similar to averaging procedures in many other applications of wavelet expansions .",
    "the result is that the energy function , as defined in this paper , remains reliable even for very large scales ( whereas the standard energy function produces large oscillations and becomes unreliable for scales above @xmath17 in fig .",
    "[ enold ] ) , making it possible to observe and quantify the `` curving '' or `` bumpiness '' of the energy function even at these large scales .",
    "the issue will be further analyzed in section [ modeld ] .    in this paper , simulations according to this model ( our model a ) will bear the label `` 0 - 1 '' .    * reward model ( rm ) * : in an attempt to make the ssm `` spikier '' , it was proposed @xcite to change the values of on - intervals from @xmath15 to some positive random value , which would be kept constant throughout the interval , values of different intervals being independent .",
    "this would reflect the non - equivalence of the users , in terms of the amount of data they can send : some may have faster connections , may run applications generating higher volumes of data etc .",
    "needless to say , the distribution of values for the on - intervals can be itself heavy - tailed . a result proved for this model",
    "states that , in the limit of infinite users , the ( properly normalized ) total traffic can be either a self - similar or a _ p - stable _ process @xcite .",
    "this model resembles real traffic a bit better ( compare fig .",
    "[ ssrw ] and [ traffic9497 ] ) , however the two types of traffic can still be discriminated visually . moreover",
    ", the marginal distribution of a part of the traffic generated by this model will always be either p - stable or gaussian , whereas in the case of the real traffic different parts may have different marginals ( see fig .",
    "[ koldist ] in section [ modelb ] ) . also , heavy - tailed value distributions lead to very high spikes , while distributions of finite second mean average out in the limit , leading to the same results as ssm ( fig .",
    "[ ssrw ] ( b),(d ) , and ( f ) ) .",
    "thus , the model does not allow for very fine control of the form of the spikes .",
    "in addition , its energy function is once more a straight line , but an additional risk is that it can be _ meaningless _ , in the case of a heavy - tailed value distribution ( see section [ enavdef ] ) .",
    "finally , as noted earlier , real traffic _ does not have heavy - tailed spikes_.    in this paper , simulations according to this model ( our model b ) will bear the label `` rh '' .",
    "@xmath18 * and * @xmath19 * traffic model * : this model , proposed and studied in @xcite , adopts a different approach , decoupling the spikes and the main body of the traffic , and dealing with each of the two separately .",
    "it suggests that internet traffic can be viewed as a superposition of two independent processes : the first ( @xmath20 traffic ) is self - similar gaussian , and has no spikes , the second ( @xmath21 traffic ) is a train of isolated spikes .",
    "the inter - spike intervals are independent and approximately exponential , i.e. spike arrivals are approximately poisson .",
    "this model was derived from , and calibrated on real traffic traces , and all of the assumptions above were shown to hold .",
    "no distribution for the spike heights was proposed in @xcite ; motivated , however , by the observed exponential marginals of the traces considered here , we will be using an exponential one in the simulations .",
    "the result of the simulation and the real traffic are almost indistinguishable visually ( compare fig .",
    "[ abtraffic ] , [ traffic9497 ] and [ trafficm6u8 ] ) .",
    "an example with a p - stable distribution is also provided .    to sum up , @xmath19-traffic accounts for the long range dependence , and @xmath21-traffic for the spikes .",
    "thus , the model matches , to some extent , the appearance , and the slowly decaying autocorrelation of the real traffic ( fig . [ ac ] and [ acnd ] ) .",
    "even better , the marginal distributions of parts of the traffic oscillate between gaussianity and p - stability , a feature shared by real traffic @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the energy function of the simulation is again oversimplifying reality ( fig .",
    "[ enold ] ) .",
    "simulations according to this model will bear the label `` rh ht '' .    * infinite source poisson model ( ispm ) * : this is a variant of the ssm . according to this model , the traffic is the sum of independent piecewise continuous connections , whose range is @xmath22 , and whose support is compact and connected .",
    "the beginning points of their supports are given by a poisson process of rate @xmath23 , and their sizes by a heavy tailed distribution of infinite variance ( see @xcite and references therein for more details ) .",
    "obviously , the support of the total traffic consisting of a finite number of connections is also finite ; thus , contrary to the ssm , this model evolves in time , as the number of connections @xmath9 increases . in order to capture this evolution , the traffic can be normalized in time by a parameter @xmath24 , which denotes time resolution , i.e. the time scale at which traffic is viewed . if the two limits @xmath25 and @xmath26 are taken simultaneously , the limit process can be either gaussian or p - stable , depending on their relative rates ( see the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "this behavior will appear again in section [ modelc ] .",
    "unfortunately , it seems that this limit process can not be linked back to real traffic in an obvious way .",
    "it is very striking that the energy function for these four models are very linear ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ enold ] , at least up to scale @xmath17 ; at coarser scales , fig .",
    "[ enold ] is no longer accurate , but the modified definition of the energy function given in section [ enavdef ] , which remains accurate at large scales , the linearity is seen to persist until even the coarsest scales ) . indeed , as many authors ( including us ) have found , `` local '' models ( in which the traffic is generated as an average over simulated sessions `` unrolling '' in time ) typically produce such nice , linear , but therefore unrealistic energy functions .    although each of the models is represented by a single simulation only in fig .",
    "[ enold](b ) , we did in fact check many values for the parameters of these models ; for other parameter values , one finds a change in the slope of the corresponding energy function but not in its essentially linear character .    in simulations for the models listed above",
    ", the features of the model seem to control only the slope , or , at best , introduce only one slope change from one scale onwards ( fig .",
    "[ enold ] ) .",
    "moreover , the energy function appears to be insensitive to the `` spikiness '' of the process ( compare exp iid with ht iid in fig . [ enold](b ) ) , although it seems to depend on the autocorrelation .",
    "the failure of these models to produce curved energy functions stimulated researchers to seek more `` exotic '' models , such as cascades , and multifractal processes in general @xcite .",
    "these models , however , are not linked in any way to a description of user or connection behavior .",
    "* multifractal models * : multifractal models , unlike all of the preceding models , produce curving energy functions @xcite . they also produce nontrivial _ multifractal spectra _ @xcite .",
    "the simplest representatives of this category are the _ random cascades _ @xcite .",
    "however , in our view , these models are `` global '' rather than `` local '' : the stochastic process that generates the simulated sessions is not inspired by network mechanisms or user characteristics , or the structure of these in time .",
    "to the contrary , these processes typically treat the whole observation time interval as an entity , and link probabilities of certain behavior in a subinterval to the probability of other behavior elsewhere , without any motivation , other than that it produces energy functions similar to those observed in real traces .",
    "since they do not take into account network mechanisms , at least in a straightforward manner , they offer little help towards understanding these mechanisms . for this reason",
    "they will be considered no further here .    * network simulation models * : these models adopt a completely different point of view , trying to incorporate into the model every single detail of the routers , the links , the protocols etc . examples are the network simulator and ( ns)(see @xcite and references therein ) , and the scalable simulation framework ( ssf ) ( see http://www.ssfnet.org/homepage.html for more information ) .",
    "as expected , they produce very good results , but the overwhelming number of parameters violates the parsimony principle , and makes it hard to estimate the impact of each of them on the traffic . for these reasons ,",
    "this approach falls outside the scope of the present paper .",
    "* summary * : in the list of models above , some follow an empirical approach , which attempts to capture properties of the traffic , but ignores the underlying mechanisms ( @xmath8 traffic , random cascades ) ; others present mathematical constructions that are motivated by network and user behavior , but produce traffic that only partially corresponds to reality ( ssm , rh ) .",
    "as far as we know , there exists no model that produces traces a ) that have the spikiness and long - range dependence of real traffic traces , b ) whose marginals match the behavior of the observed marginals , which are sometimes close to and at other times deviate far from gaussianity , and c ) with a curving energy function .",
    "obtaining a curving energy function via a `` local '' model seems particularly hard : extensive experimentation by the authors with simulations of the models described above and in section [ datsim ] always produced linear , or at best essentially piecewise linear graphs ( as in fig .",
    "[ enold](b ) and [ enavcur](a ) ) , except for our model d described in section [ modeld ] .",
    "random cascade models do produce curving energy functions ; they are however not satisfactory , not only because they offer no explanation of the underlying mechanism , relating to network protocols or user behavior , but also because the resulting traffic still contradicts real traces in various other aspects ( auto - correlation , marginal distributions etc . ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present a model that describes internet traffic on a network link ; the main guideline in the construction of this model will be the incorporation , into the ssm , of additional network mechanisms and aspects of user behavior that will be identified as responsible for shaping the traffic .",
    "it will turn out that enriching the ssm with only a few extra features leads to simulations exhibiting spikiness ( i.e. marginals ) , long - range dependence , curving of the energy function , and wide oscillations in the deviation of its marginals from gaussianity that are qualitatively and quantitatively indistinguishable from the same features of real traces .",
    "the impact of these features on the traffic will be rigorously determined by means of theorems , and the predictions of these theorems will be subsequently validated against real traffic .",
    "the success of this validation will suggest that the factors that have been identified as important for shaping the traffic are indeed important , and may explain the behavior of the real traffic singled out by the four criteria above .    in order to increase clarity , the construction will proceed incrementally in 4 steps , labeled a , b , c , and d. at each step , a theorem will state and prove the properties of the model built so far . step a will be the plain old ssm ; step b will take into account that information transmission does not take place continuously , but rather in packets spaced apart by variable time intervals , which is turn are determined by the round trip times ; step c will then introduce the slow start feature of the tcp protocol into the model , arguing that the small volume of information exchanged by the majority of the connections is such as to allow slow start to impact the traffic heavily ; and , finally , step d will enrich the model with other , longer time scales , characteristic of network activity , originating from either user behavior ( e.g. switch of application ) , or protocol actions ( e.g. congestion control ) .",
    "* step a * : the basic model , which will serve as the founding ground for the rest , will be the ssm , introduced and studied in @xcite . theorem a states and proves its properties .    * step b * : here",
    ", a finer structure will be imposed upon the on - intervals of the ssm : each value of 1 will be followed by a rtt , and rtts will be modeled by means of random variables . in general , little is known about their distribution @xcite , but in large capacity links of the internet backbone , packet interarrival times tend to be exponentially distributed and independent  @xcite .",
    "fortunately , this is not a serious issue , since theorem b below asserts that the simulated traffic is insensitive to this distribution , as long as it has finite variance .",
    "moreover , theorem b states that the traffic is actually gaussian , and fairly uncorrelated at small time scales ( brownian motion ) , but that the correlation grows stronger in larger time scales ( causing the process to become self - similar ) ; this prediction is borne out by real data ( fig .",
    "[ ac ] and [ acnd ] ) .",
    "* step c : * this step incorporates features of the tcp / ip combination of protocols , responsible for the bulk of data transfer over the internet today , into the model .",
    "one of the characteristics of tcp , the _ slow start _ , roughly stipulates that the number of packets sent at each emission time increases _ geometrically _ by a factor of 2 ( 1,2,4,8 , ... ) , until either loss occurs , a preset maximum is reached , or all data is sent ( for more details , see e.g. @xcite ) . in detailed traces , which show individual connections ,",
    "the slow start is easily discernible ; this suggested its incorporation in the model , and the exploration of the consequences of its inclusion .",
    "theorem c states that the traffic will tend to be either self - similar or p - stable , contingent upon the slow start maximum and the number of users . in practice",
    ", p - stability can not be distinguished from other very large deviations from gaussianity , since observations can only last for a finite amount of time .",
    "nevertheless , the fluctuation of the number of active users in time will allow for both self - similar regimes and regimes that deviate far from this self - similar behavior within the same trace , as is also observed in real traces .",
    "an increase of the number of users steers the process towards self - similarity .",
    "* step d * : user connections over the internet seem to be governed by a hierarchy of time scales ( _ levels _ ) ; for example , a particular session of data 94 seems to live in six different time scales ( fig .",
    "[ lev ] ) , at approximately 2000 , 500 , 100 , 40 , 5 , and 0.1s , and a session of trace m6 in three different time scales ( fig .",
    "[ levnd ] ) , at approximately 2 , 0.4 , and 0.01s . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", there has been no effort yet towards the exact quantification and explanation of these levels at different scales , but it is commonly accepted that they exist @xcite .",
    "a possible explanation could lie in the recursive structure within internet applications ( e.g. web browsers opening multiple sessions , ftp applications establishing multiple connections , etc . ,",
    "tcp , which sends and waits for receipt acknowledgement , etc . ) , and the human work habits , according to which tasks are broken into subtasks recursively .",
    "analysis of 50 typical ( long enough ) sessions of trace 94 reveals that levels are present in all of them , and are more or less similar .",
    "moreover , their statistical properties ( mean duration , variance , and range ) are similar for other traces of the same time period .    so far , model a had just 1 level , and models b and c each had 2 levels .",
    "this step introduces more levels , at larger time scales .",
    "theorem d then proves that such levels cause the energy function to curve .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section [ enavdef ] describes the statistical tools used ( including the modified definition of the energy function ) , and sections [ modela ] , [ modelb ] , [ modelc ] , and [ modeld ] deal with models a , b , c and d respectively .",
    "section 7 concludes the paper with a discussion and some applications ; in particular , several simple tools are introduced that detect the presence and number of levels , and that quantify the behavior of the traffic .",
    "let @xmath27 represent a time series .",
    "in what follows , extensive use of three standard statistical tools will be made :    1 .   empirical marginal distributions : @xmath28 2 .",
    "autocorrelations : @xmath29 where @xmath30 3 .",
    "the _ kolmogorov distance _ between two cumulative density functions ( cdfs ) , which is defined as the maximum of the absolute value of their difference : @xmath31    in addition , the energy function will be used , as well as a more intuitively appealing ( in our opinion ) variant , the _ p - averaging function _ ( similar to the normalized variance appearing in @xcite ) , introduced below .",
    "the definition of the @xmath32-averaging function will be completed in two steps : initially , a definition that ensures compatibility with the well established energy function @xcite ( in a sense to be made clear below ) will be proposed .",
    "then , a simple observation will lead to the redefinition of both averaging and energy functions .",
    "given a stationary sequence @xmath33 , for some @xmath34 , define @xmath35 for @xmath36 and @xmath37 , define the * p - averaging * @xmath38 } = \\left ( \\frac{1}{m_{j}}\\sum_{k=1}^{m_{j}}(m_{j , k})^{p}\\right ) ^{1/p}\\ ] ] and the * energy * @xmath39 notice the connection of this definition of the energy function to the haar wavelet coefficients as in @xcite .",

    "this set of definitions has been motivated by the following heuristic :    * heuristic * : let @xmath46 represent the value of the traffic for the @xmath47th time bin , taken to be the _ initial _ time bin , and assume the sequence is ergodic , ( i.e. @xmath48 ) . what is the rate of this convergence ?",
    "the way to determine the rate is to find a function @xmath49 such that @xmath50 .",
    "typically , the function @xmath51 is increasing in @xmath9 , at least for @xmath9 sufficiently large , expressing the fact that the average @xmath52 gets closer to @xmath53 when @xmath9 increases . in practice , because @xmath53 is unknown , one can still get a handle on @xmath51 by comparing two different averages :    @xmath54\\right\\}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    where @xmath55 was set . in ( @xmath56 )",
    "we used stationarity .",
    "notice also that ( @xmath57 ) proves that @xmath58([heur])@xmath59 .",
    "we claim that , if the @xmath60 are _ asymptotically independent _ , i.e. @xmath61 , as @xmath62 ( irrespectively of the rate ) , then ( [ heur ] ) has a _ strictly _ positive limit , and , therefore , that it can be used to estimate @xmath51 ( within a multiplicative constant ) .",
    "because asymptotical independence is satisfied by most processes arising in applications ( it is extremely unlikely that two random variables arbitrarily long apart will exhibit strong dependence ) , this method can be applied to a wide range of processes , and is , for this reason , very powerful .",
    "indeed , as @xmath63 , for fixed @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and therefore it becomes infinitely smaller than @xmath66 .",

    "although the name `` @xmath32-averaging '' may appear to be inappropriately chosen at first sight , it actually describes well the fundamental principle of the function , which may be buried under its complicated definition .",
    "the @xmath32-averaging function endeavors to measure the rate of convergence of averages of @xmath9 consecutive points of the process to its true mean , as @xmath9 increases , where `` rate of convergence '' denotes the deviation between the @xmath9 point mean value estimator and the true mean .",
    "unfortunately , the true mean is unknown .",
    "one way to circumvent this problem is to measure the rate by which two @xmath9 point estimators converge to each other ; the two aforementioned convergence rates should be essentially the same , their relative difference being at most @xmath87 at all times ( see the related discussion in the heuristic above ) .",
    "this basic idea will then subsequently be elaborated in definition 2 below , which ensures that the rate gets measured accurately , by comparing a large number @xmath88 of pairs of @xmath9 point estimators , @xmath9 increasing geometrically , and , in addition , that it gets measured equally accurately for all @xmath9 , by making @xmath88 independent of @xmath9 .",
    "these details aside , though , it is clear that the @xmath32-averaging function `` averages '' the traces in order to estimate their mean , or rather how difficult it is to estimate their mean , hence the name `` averaging function ''",
    ".    it has been implicitly assumed , of course , that @xmath46 is stationary .",
    "although there are many arguments against internet traffic being stationary , it can be assumed to be so over reasonably short time intervals .",
    "this could mean a couple of hours , according to @xcite ) , so the older data sets ( before 1997 ) , with a duration of at most 2 hours , can be considered to be stationary .",
    "the more recent ones only last for less than 2 minutes , but they are also the products of a much faster network .",
    "are they also stationary ?",

    "b ) in the older traces , consecutive packets in the link seem to be 0.1ms apart , whereas in the newer traces they seem to be 1@xmath89s apart , in order of magnitude , i.e. the network has become faster by approximately 100 times .",
    "so , what needed an hour before needs now approximately a minute , and thus the duration of the old and new traces , normalized by the network speed , is the same .",
    "under the definitions above , the computation at the scale @xmath90 , for either the energy or the averaging functions , involves a mean value over @xmath91 numbers .",
    "consequently , for @xmath78 close to @xmath92 , the sum will comprise insufficiently many terms to produce a reliable mean , assuming that such a mean is indeed the ultimate goal of the computation , and undesirable oscillations may be observed ( see fig [ enold ] ) .",
    "instinctively , it is expected that averaging over more numbers will lead to smoother curves .",
    "thus , a modification of the definition of the energy and p - averaging functions is in order ; the definition that follows will allow for averaging over the maximum number of terms possible , i.e. @xmath93 , by using a standard technique of statistics , known as _",

    "how different is the new definition from the old ?",
    "stationarity can now be fully exploited , in the sense that there is no `` beginning of time '' for the sequences : namely , it can be assumed that they are ordered circularly ( on a ring ) , not linearly ( on an interval ) .",

    "the result now follows since the tail behavior of @xmath377 is the same as for @xmath378 .      according to theorem c , and contingent upon the relation between @xmath9 and the maximum window size @xmath379",
    ", the limit process can be either gaussian or p - stable .",
    "notice , however , that this condition does not depend on the length @xmath24 of the time interval under consideration .",
    "therefore , it can be conjectured that the result applies `` locally '' .",
    "this , in turn , suggests two possible mechanisms causing oscillations between gaussianity and p - stability .    on the one hand , although formally @xmath9 users are active in @xmath220 $ ] , their actual number may fluctuate , if examined on smaller time intervals ( fig .",
    "[ stat94 ] ) .",
    "let then @xmath380 be the number of users , among the total @xmath9 users of the simulation , who are in an on - interval at time @xmath115 . if @xmath381 , the local behavior around @xmath115 will tend to be p - stable , if @xmath382 , it will tend to be gaussian .",
    "this oscillation is observed in practice ( fig .",
    "[ koldist ] ) , and mere visual inspection reveals that the number of users and the gaussianity of the process are well correlated ( table [ crosscorr ] ) .",
    "the fluctuation of the number of active users in time can apparently be well modeled by model a. finally , notice that the number of bins used to compute the marginals is _ not _",
    "responsible for this oscillation , as it is kept fixed throughout the computation .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath379 itself can change , too .",
    "this happens actually in real networks built on tcp / ip , where , according to the protocol specifications , packet loss halves the window size . in other words , according to theorem c , the more congested the network is , the more gaussian the traffic should look like .",
    "this has indeed been confirmed @xcite .    as a consequence ,",
    "if incorporation of packet losses into this model is required , @xmath379 can be allowed to be different for each user , and randomly selected , but constant .",
    "simulations of model c seem to be very successful in resembling the true traffic visually , and in capturing its long range dependence ( see fig . [ sssim ] , [ traffic9497 ] , and [ trafficm6u8 ] ) . to test whether the other prediction of theorem c , namely the oscillation between gaussianity and p - stability , is indeed seen in real traffic ,",
    "the following experiment was designed . for simplicity",
    ", the description will be based on the 94 trace , when it comes to choosing values of parameters , but it can be easily translated into the context of newer traces , using the observation that transmission appears to be 100 times faster .    start by binning the trace using a bin of @xmath383 . since under a time bin of @xmath384 it is mostly true that at most one packet falls into a particular time bin , the @xmath384 bin size can be considered a `` natural '' time bin for the trace ; taking a marginal distribution of the trace at this bin size would yield the marginal of the packet size itself . consequently , the value of every bin is the sum of 1000 `` natural '' bins , i.e. the sum of 1000 identically distributed random variables , and actually distributed as the packet size , if 0 is allowed to be a legitimate packet size .",
    "one would hope that this number is sufficiently large to yield a reasonably accurate convergence to the gaussian limit predicted by the clt , if convergence to a gaussian r.v . were to hold , or yield results that are observably at least non - gaussian , if convergence to a p - stable limit were to hold .",
    "actual convergence to the p - stable limit is too much to ask for , because a ) a different normalization is required for that , compared to the gaussian limit , and b ) infinite variance is impossible to capture with a finite trace , so that a p - stable variable can not be distinguished from a large variance variable , in practice ( see fig .",
    "[ koldisttest](e ) and ( f ) ) .    in order to examine the trace behavior locally ,",
    "we divide the trace using consecutive , equisized , non - overlapping windows and take the normalized marginal ( corresponding to mean 0 and variance 1 ) within each window .",
    "we then compute the kolmogorov distance ( see ( [ kold ] ) ) between this marginal and a normal @xmath385 distribution , for each window ; graphing this kolmogorov distance as a function of the bin label illustrates changes in time of the local behavior .",
    "as in the case of the windowed fourier transform , the window size is the result of a trade - off : small windows will yield well localized inaccurate results , whereas large windows will yield poorly localized accurate results .",
    "a size of 512 bins seemed a good choice , thus ending up with approximately 140 points in the graph ( the trace consists of approximately 72000 bins ) .",
    "the resulting kolmogorov distance graphs for the data sets are shown in fig .",
    "[ koldist](a ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) . in some cases ,",
    "the kolmogorov distance is small throughout ( m6 , m7 , l4 ) ; in others it oscillates violently .    in order to calibrate these results",
    ", we performed the same computations on realizations of known distributions ; the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ koldisttest](a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) .    in fig .",
    "[ koldisttest](a ) we compare a realization of the normal distribution with the theoretical curve ; as expected , we find a very small kolmogorov distance @xmath386 .",
    "based on this , we place the threshold of `` not differing fro gaussianity '' at @xmath387 .    in fig .",
    "[ koldisttest](b ) one can see the results for the three heavy - tailed distributions of @xmath388 , where @xmath389 respectively ; in these cases the oscillations of the local kolmogorov distance to normal have a larger amplitude ( the difference between minimum and maximum is about 0.12 in all three cases , which is between 25 and 35% of the mean kolmogorov distance ) , but they all are solidly above 0.2 , and move further away from normal as @xmath390 increases , as is to be expected .    fig .",
    "[ koldisttest](c ) shows the local kolmogorov distance to normal for four different weibull distributions , with cumulative distributions @xmath391 . for @xmath392 ,",
    "the graph is in the gaussian range , as could be expected ; as @xmath390 decreases , one moves away from the gaussian range , and the oscillations in the local behavior become more marked ; nevertheless , their amplitude never exceeds 35% of the mean .",
    "for @xmath393 they remain well segregated from the gaussian reange at all times .",
    "we can now evaluate the results for the data sets based on these calibrations .",
    "the data sets m6 and m7 look solidly gaussian , as does the slow start simulation with @xmath394 ; data 97 and simulations with @xmath395 dart between gaussianiy and the region @xmath396 , with a total oscillation amplitude approaching 60% of their mean ; data sets 94 , l4 and l5 , and simulations with @xmath397 reach much larger @xmath386 , but occasionally reach into gaussianity , and their total oscillation amplitude exceeds their mean ; finally , trace u8 is completely in the `` far from gaussianity '' region @xmath398 , with again maximum oscillation exceeding its mean .",
    "however , what distinguishes these traces is that they reach local kolmogorov distances typical of distributions with large variance , yet that , unlike e.g. the large variance weibull distributions , they have very large amplitude that occasionally take them back to or close to gaussianity . for @xmath276 in a `` critical '' range ( @xmath395 for our parameters ) , our simulations have the same character .",
    "this suggests that the data , as well as the simulation , exhibit an oscillation between gaussian and far - from - gaussian behavior , consistent with theorem c.      an experiment related to the previous one is the following : compute the kolmogorov distances of the traces , as before , and also calculate the total traffic within each window .",
    "this procedure generates two new sequences .",
    "table [ crosscorr ] gives their correlation for our different data sets , for 0.128s - binned traffic .",
    "interestingly , it is non - negligible and negative for all the data sets that are clearly not uniformly gaussian according to the discussion above ( i.e. 94 , l4 , l5 , u8 , and 89 ) .",
    "this is again consistent with theorem c , by the following argument : theorem c states that the more numerous the active users are , the more gaussian the traffic will be , and thus the smaller the kolmogorov distance . on the other hand , the number of active users is highly and positively correlated with the traffic volume .",
    "the combination of the two statements implies that traffic volume and the kolmogorov distances should be negatively correlated , unless , of course , the traffic is already ( almost ) gaussian , in which case no prediction according to the theorems is possible ( the data sets close to gaussianity are traces 97 , m6 , and m7 , whose correlations are indeed either negligible or positive ) .",
    "note that gaussian - type traffic is _ not _ extremely spiky .",
    "the negative correlations in table [ crosscorr ] thus illustrate that when more users are active , and when traffic is heavier , it becomes less spiky .",
    "this seems counterintuitive ; yet it is consistent with theorem c , and borne out by the data .",
