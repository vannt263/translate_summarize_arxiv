    "<S> _ conclusion . </S>",
    "<S> _    we have proposed a quantum thermal machine - working either as a quantum heat engine or as a quantum refrigerator - based on the vacuum forces between a graphene and a gold nanoresonator . </S>",
    "<S> the machine working fluid is the lower polariton resulting from the hybridization of the graphene- and gold - like flexural modes , interacting via casimir ( vacuum ) forces . with the help of piezoelectric cells , we select and sweep the hybridized mode frequency , alternating the thermal contact with the two reservoirs . </S>",
    "<S> the operation of our machine depends on the strong - coupling condition , a feature that is a hallmark of nanomechanical systems at cryogenic temperatures , as the decaying rate is much weaker than the avoided - crossing frequency . due to a rabi frequency of a few mhz , </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to perform quasi - adiabatic strokes of duration @xmath158s , thus suppressing transitions to the upper polariton branch . </S>",
    "<S> we further observe that high performance is compatible with a finite - time thermodynamical analysis within a experimentally accessible set of parameters . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we obtain typical efficiencies at maximum power of @xmath159 , for the system operating as a heat engine , and a coefficient of performance of @xmath160 for the refrigeration cycle . </S>",
    "<S> since the performance of our cycle is proportional to the ratio between the final and initial frequencies , our proposal is specially advantageous . </S>",
    "<S> this happens because our resonators have very different bending stiffnesses . </S>",
    "<S> these features suggest that our thermodynamical cycle may be relevant for temperature control ( or temperature measurements ) in experiments of suspended films . particularly important </S>",
    "<S> are the technologies involving graphene at cryogenic temperatures @xcite , for which both the electric and thermal resistivity mostly depends on the flexural phonons @xcite .    </S>",
