    "since the discovery of synchronization in pendulum clocks by huygens , synchronous behavior has been widely observed not only in physical systems but also in biological ones such as pacemaker cells in the heart , chirps of crickets , and fetal - maternal heart rate synchronization @xcite .",
    "such synchronization phenomena have been studied theoretically in terms of nonlinear dynamics , particularly by exploiting oscillator models @xcite . for example , synchronization observed in fireflies can be modeled using nonlinear periodic oscillators and is described as _",
    "phase synchronization_. further , it has been indicated that the notion of phase synchronization can be extended to chaotic oscillators .",
    "this phenomenon is called _ chaotic phase synchronization _ ( cps ) @xcite .",
    "furthermore , synchronization phenomena in neural systems have also attracted considerable attention in recent years . at the macroscopic level of the brain activity",
    ", synchronous behavior has been observed in electroencephalograms , local field potentials , etc .",
    "these observations raise a possibility that such neural synchronization plays an important role in brain functions such as perception @xcite as well as even in dysfunctions such as parkinson s disease and epilepsy @xcite .",
    "in addition , at the level of a single neuron , it has been observed that specific spiking - bursting neurons in the cat visual cortex contribute to the synchronous activity evoked by visual stimulation @xcite ; further , in animal models of parkinson s disease , several types of bursting neurons are synchronized @xcite .",
    "moreover , two coupled neurons extracted from the central pattern generator of the stomatogastric ganglion in a lobster exhibit synchronization with irregular spiking - bursting behavior @xcite .",
    "hence , it is important to use mathematical models of neurons to examine the mechanism of neuronal synchronization with spiking - bursting behavior . as mathematical models that include such neural oscillations , the chay model @xcite and the hindmarsh - rose ( hr ) model @xcite",
    "have been widely used .",
    "these models can generate both regular and chaotic bursting on the basis of _ slow - fast _ dynamics .",
    "the slow and fast dynamics correspond to slow oscillations surmounted by spikes and spikes within each burst , respectively .",
    "the former is related to a long time scale , and the latter , to a short one .",
    "phase synchronization in such neuronal models is different from that in ordinary chaotic systems such as the rssler system , owing to the fact that neuronal models typically exhibit multiple time scales .",
    "however , it is possible to quantitatively analyze the neuronal models by simplification , for example , by reducing the number of phase variables to 1 by a projection of an attractor ( a projection onto a delayed coordinate and/or a velocity space @xcite ) .",
    "recently , a method called _ localized sets _ technique has been proposed for detecting phase synchronization in neural networks , without explicitly defining the phase @xcite .    in this paper , we focus on synchronization in periodically driven single bursting neuron models , which is simpler than that in a network of neurons . in previous studies , phase synchronization of such a neuron with a driving force has been considered both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite . in these studies ,",
    "the period of the driving force was made close to that of the slow oscillation of a driven neuron .",
    "on the other hand , in this work , we adopt the chay model @xcite to investigate whether phase synchronization also occurs with the application of a force whose period is as short as that of the spikes .",
    "in particular , we focus on the effect of the slow mode ( slow oscillation ) on the synchronization of the fast mode ( spikes ) .",
    "it should be noted that this fast driven system may be significant from the viewpoint of neuroscience .",
    "in fact , fast oscillations with local field potentials have been observed in the hippocampus and are correlated with synchronous activity at the level of a single neuron @xcite .     from intensive numerical simulations of our model , we find that the localized sets technique can be used to detect cps between the spikes and the periodic driving force , even in the case of multiple time scales .",
    "furthermore , we find two characteristic properties around the transition point to cps .",
    "first , the average time interval between successive phase slips exhibits a power - law scaling against the driving force strength .",
    "the scaling exponent undergoes an unsmooth change as the driving force strength is varied .",
    "second , an order parameter @xmath3 , which measures the degree of phase synchronization , shows a stepwise dependence on the driving force strength @xmath4 before the transition . that is , @xmath5 does not increase monotonically with @xmath4 but includes a plateau over a range of @xmath4 ( a step ) , where @xmath3 is almost constant .",
    "both of these characteristics are attributed to the effects of the slow mode on the fast mode and have not been observed in a system with a single time scale .",

    "we have investigated cps in a spiking - bursting neuron model under periodic forcing with a small amplitude but with a frequency as high as that of the spikes .",
    "first , we observed @xmath0 cps between the spikes and the periodic force .",
    "this cps has been detected on the basis of the fact that a set of points , which are conditioned by the phases of the periodic force at each spiking time , was concentrated on a sector of the unit circle .",
    "in addition to cps , we observed two characteristic phenomena around the transition point to cps .",
    "one phenomenon involves a change in the power - law scaling for the average time intervals between phase slips , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sliploglog.eps](b ) .",
    "this scaling behavior is different from that exhibited by the conventional system , i.e. , a chaotic system whose attractor has a single rotation center with only one characteristic time scale . in such a conventional system ,",
    "the scaling exponent for the transition to cps takes a unique value of @xmath115 .",
    "this might be because the phase synchronization in question can not be simply associated with a saddle - node bifurcation , owing to the interaction between the slow and the fast dynamics .",
    "the other phenomenon shows a stepwise behavior before the transition to cps , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : worefracop.eps](b ) .",
    "this phenomenon has been found by the observation that the degree of phase synchronization is not sensitive to the amplitude of the force just before the transition point .",
    "moreover , we found that a decrease in the degree of synchronization appears ( at @xmath116 in fig .",
    "[ fig : worefracop.eps](b ) ) even if the amplitude of the force is increased .",
    "the stepwise behavior and this decrease could be induced by the effect of slow dynamics ( see appendix [ mech ] ) .    from the viewpoint of neuroscience",
    ", our system might be regarded as a simple model whose fast driving force corresponds to sharp wave - ripples .",
    "this phenomenon involves a very fast oscillation of local field potentials observed in the hippocampus in the brain @xcite .",
    "let us discuss , below , a possible interpretation of our results in terms of synchronization phenomena in real neuronal systems .",
    "first , the observed phenomena in our model , particularly cps with a fast driving force , can be interpreted as a consequence of the interaction between the ripples and the activity of a single neuron .",
    "in fact , it has been experimentally shown that such ripples synchronize in phase with the spikes of a single neuron @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been suggested that firing sequences accompanying ripples in the hippocampal network form a representation of stored information .",
    "the replay of the firing sequences during sleep mediates a consolidation of memory for the stored information in the hippocampus and the neocortex @xcite .",
    "in addition , some experimental results have indicated that such a memory replay is conducted on a shorter time scale than the actual experience , where the spatiotemporal structure of the firing sequences plays a key role in the stored information @xcite .",
    "thus , if our spiking - bursting system with a fast driving force can be regarded as a model for such biological neurons , our result would imply that the precision of the temporal structure of the spiking patterns might be enhanced by cps in real neuronal systems .",
    "it should be noticed that cps is not affected even if there exist small fluctuations in isis and that cps extends the detection of the temporal structures of the firing patterns in the short time scale of a spiking - bursting behavior .",
    "additionally , from another point of view , the slow oscillations along the lower envelope of the membrane potential @xmath7 can be considered as transitions between the up and down states in a cortical neuron .",
    "specifically , we focus on the up and down states during the slow - wave sleep . here , the neurons in the up state fire synchronously with higher frequency , whereas the activity of the neurons in the down state is relatively quiescent @xcite . from this perspective , the disappearance of the quiescent periods ( down states ) in the forced spiking in our simulation may be interpreted as a persistently depolarized up state observed for cortical neurons in the awake states . in fact , the prolonged down states during sleep are likely to occur owing to a decrease in the excitatory input @xcite . therefore ,",
    "if this input can be regarded as our sinusoidal driving force , cps may efficiently help a weak input to depolarize a down state into a persistent up one .",
    "_ reported that a neural network model can qualitatively reproduce the experimental results in @xcite using a time - discrete map model , which is simpler than our model @xcite .",
    "therefore , we may infer that our results on cps at high frequency in the simple spiking - busting neuron model provide some suggestions for neuroscience to understand the mechanisms of the abovementioned real neuronal activity , particularly in terms of nonlinear dynamics .",
    "the following topics might be considered from the viewpoint of extending this study .",
    "first , for the future study it would be important to confirm whether our findings can be observed in other slow - fast models such as the hindmarsh - rose model @xcite and other biophysical models @xcite .",
    "a comparison with the other models will provide further insight into slow - fast dynamics in the neuronal spiking - bursting activity .",
    "moreover , it should be important to clarify the general onset mechanism of the observed phenomena using map - based models , as was clarified in @xcite .",
    "it should also be important to investigate the response of coupled bursting systems to sinusoidal forcing in terms of the interaction between the slow and the fast dynamics .",
