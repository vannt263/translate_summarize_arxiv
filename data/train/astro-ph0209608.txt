    "a large body of work in the last two decades has established that binaries with active accretion disks are the most common way that stars form .",
    "surveys of regions of star formation using speckle images @xcite and lunar occultations @xcite have established that binaries are ubiquitous among the youngest stars . direct imaging @xcite and surveys of infrared excesses",
    "@xcite have discovered circumstellar disks around many newly - formed stars .",
    "most young circumstellar disks accrete onto their central stars , as evidenced by inverse p - cygni line profiles @xcite and excess emission from the accretion hot spot at optical and ultraviolet wavelengths ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    to understand how stars form we must address several fundamental questions concerning binaries and their disks .",
    "one of the most basic of these is whether or not the components of a young binary have the same age .",
    "if capture plays a role in binary formation then a range of ages should occur within pairs , while if the secondary forms out of a disk around the primary then the secondary should be younger than the primary .",
    "if the relative location of primaries and their secondaries is consistent throughout the hr - diagram , it may be possible to measure the location of isochrones that must be reproduced by theoretical models of young stars .",
    "while most pairs generally fall along isochrones derived from theoretical pre - main - sequence evolutionary tracks @xcite , uncertainties in the effective temperature scale at the lowest masses and difficulties in estimating stellar luminosities , especially when individual spectra of the two stars are lacking , have made it difficult to compare ages within pairs . in some pairs",
    "infrared companions exist that are much more obscured , and therefore possibly significantly younger , than their optically visible primaries .",
    "however , extinction does not necessarily correlate inversely with age  highly embedded companions may be obscured only temporarily by an episode of infalling envelope material . hence , these infrared companions are not necessarily younger simply because they are more reddened @xcite .",
    "any secondary that is more luminous than its primary must also be younger , because isochrones always slope down and to the right in an hr diagram for pre - main - sequence stars .",
    "other important issues are whether the masses , spatial extents , lifetimes , and accretion histories of primary circumstellar disks differ from those that surround the secondaries",
    ". recent studies of the frequency of disks in young binaries have concluded that mixed pairs ",
    "those where one star is a classical t  tauri star ( ctts ; stars with circumstellar disks ) and the other a weak - lined t  tauri star ( wtts ; stars without detectable disks )  are rare @xcite .",
    "stars with the highest accretion rates tend to be more massive ( i.e. , primaries , on average , accrete more rapidly than secondaries do ) , but there is no obvious correlation between mass accretion rates and separations ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter wg01 ) .",
    "how disks interact in binary systems when the distance between the stars is smaller than the typical size of a disk , @xmath1 100  au , is a topic of much current research . models of these close binaries typically surround the stars with a circumbinary disk , as has been imaged with adaptive optics and with hst around some systems @xcite . in dq",
    "tau , it appears that the eccentric orbit of the binary leads to cyclic pulses of accretion from the circumbinary disk onto the stars @xcite . in such systems",
    "the less massive star may accrete faster than the more massive star does @xcite , a prediction that can in principle be tested observationally .    to make progress in these areas one must measure the spectral types , accretion rates , luminosities , emission line fluxes , and reddenings of each primary and secondary independently , which requires individual spectra and photometry for each star .",
    "the stellar luminosities and effective temperatures , when compared with predictions of published pre - main - sequence evolutionary tracks , provide the masses and ages of each star . if the primaries are , on average , coeval with their secondaries , it should be possible to test the accuracy of the theoretical tracks , which have been undergoing significant revisions as the assumption of grey photospheres has been relaxed @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to test the evolutionary tracks if there is an independent measurement of the stellar masses from orbital motion @xcite or from keplerian rotation of the molecular disk @xcite .    in this study",
    "we focus on 20 close pairs where the projected separations are @xmath2 100  au . even in the taurus - auriga complex ,",
    "the closest significant population of ctts , these size scales are all subarcsecond and most can not be resolved from the ground .",
    "our spectroscopic study extends the work of wg01 , who mainly used photometric hst observations to investigate close binaries . by combining both low - resolution and medium - resolution spectra together",
    "we can measure spectral types , reddenings , accretion and emission line properties of each component of each pair accurately .",
    "together with the wg01 photometry , the new spectra give the best overview to date of how young close binary systems interact with their disks .",
    "spectra of 20 close t  tauri binaries were observed using the ccd detector attached to the stis spectrograph on the hubble space telescope between 26 nov 1998 and 22 jan 2001 .",
    "the medium - resolution spectra taken with the g750 m grating with central wavelength 6252  have a resolution of r @xmath1 7000 , a dispersion of 0.56   per pixel , and range from 5950   6550 .",
    "similarly , the low - resolution spectra that used the g750l grating at central wavelength 7750  have a resolution of r @xmath1 900 , a dispersion of 4.9  per pixel , and cover 5270   10260 .",
    "the central wavelengths are optimal for measuring tio bands in reddened young stars .",
    "ideally one would align the 52@xmath3 slit of stis with the stars in each pair , but for many targets this was not possible owing to severe scheduling constraints imposed by the proximity of the targets to the ecliptic . in most cases",
    "a 0.2@xmath3 slit was used , but five pairs ( dd  tau , fq  tau , fv  tau , uz  tau  w , and v999  tau ) required the 0.5@xmath3 slit to allow the observations to be done over a larger range of position angles , and for v927  tau ( lk h@xmath0 331 ) , the @xmath4 slit was the only one that allowed the observations to be done .",
    "the spectral resolution is the same to within measurement error through these three slits .",
    "reduction of the spectra followed the standard pipeline procedure with several modifications .",
    "sporadic dark counts on the stis ccd were the dominant source of noise in most spectra . subtracting",
    "a ` day dark ' improved the situation somewhat , but many hot pixels remained . to clean the data we developed a procedure where",
    "statistics measured over a box are compared with the pixel value at the center of the box to determine if the value is erroneously high or low . real absorption or emission lines",
    "will display the psf of the system in the spatial dimension , while hot pixels will not . through trial and error and individual inspection of each two - dimensional image one",
    "can effectively eliminate all the hot pixels in this manner without affecting any real features .",
    "the low - resolution data had to be corrected for fringing using flats taken for this purpose .",
    "the correction procedure reduced the amplitude of the fringing across the entire spectrum to less than 5% , a significant improvement over the 30%  ",
    "40%  amplitudes present in the reddest portion of the spectra before the fringe corrections . fringing varies spatially over only a few pixels , so it is necessary to correct the secondary separately from the primary .",
    "fringing corrections were negligible for wavelengths @xmath2 8000 .",
    "flux levels of the medium - resolution and low - resolution spectra of the same star taken within the same orbit agree on average within 8% , so the absolute flux calibrations and extractions agree to this level . in all cases the slopes of the medium - resolution and low - resolution spectra are essentially identical .",
    "errors in relative flux calibrations at different wavelengths across a single spectrum are dominated by psf variations in stis , especially at the longest wavelengths in the low - resolution spectra , and should be @xmath2 5% . the effect of the psf on our medium - resolution spectra is @xmath5 1% .",
    "the psfs were corrected according to the tables appropriate for the slit used in the observations .",
    "when the pairs are separated by more than about 0.3@xmath3 , it is possible to extract each spectrum from the 2d data by simply summing the appropriate rows and applying the appropriate flux correction with wavelength given the extraction aperture ( the psf of stis develops an extended tail in the near - ir that is corrected in the flux calibration , which depends on the aperture size ) .",
    "however , when the separation is less than 0.3@xmath3 the psfs of the primary and secondary overlap , and must be deblended .",
    "the deblending was done by first extracting the spectrum of primary+secondary with a large aperture , and then determining the ratio of the primary to secondary flux at each wavelength by fitting a gaussian to the location of the primary and secondary , which are known empirically from the acquisition image taken immediately before the spectrum .",
    "the result proves to be essentially independent of the choice of the fitting function because the goal is only to determine the ratio of primary to secondary fluxes . by combining the ratio spectrum with the combined spectrum we obtained individual spectra of the primaries and secondaries .",
    "we define the ` primary ' as the brighter star at 7000 . in the case of fq  tau , where the fluxes of the two stars are nearly equal at 7000",
    ", we take the bluer star , which has an earlier spectral type , to be the primary . with these definitions",
    "the secondary can be more luminous overall , especially if it is very red , but the primary always turns out to be the most massive star in the pair for the objects in our sample .",
    "position angles and separations of the pairs reported in table  1 were measured from the unfiltered 100x100 ccd acquisition images ( fig .",
    "1 ) obtained with stis .",
    "uncertainties in the pa and separation are dominated by centroiding errors , which are typically 0.1  0.2 pixels . by comparison ,",
    "uncertainties in the plate scale of stis ( 0.05072 arcseconds per pixel ) and orientation of hst are negligible .",
    "all of the pairs with separations @xmath2 0.3@xmath3 ( df  tau , fo  tau , gg  tau , fs  tau , and is  tau ) have position angles that differ by 10 degrees or more from those in the literature , while the discrepancies for more widely separated pairs are all smaller .",
    "the pa of a circular orbit at the distance to taurus with a separation of 0.2 arcsecond and a combined mass of 1 m@xmath6 varies by 10 degrees in about 4 years .",
    "the pa of the closest binary , df tau ( separation 0.099@xmath3 , changed by @xmath1 30 degrees from the value reported by @xcite from previous hst images taken in july of 1994 .",
    "deriving the physical properties of the inner disk and stellar photosphere of the t tauri star requires estimates of the reddening , spectral type , and veiling .",
    "because veiling fills in absorption features and makes the broadband colors of the underlying stellar photosphere more blue , the veiling must be measured before assigning a stellar spectral type and deriving the reddening . to measure veiling , we approximate the underlying stellar spectrum with a ` template spectrum ' chosen to match the stellar photosphere as closely as possible .",
    "we then adopt a spectral shape for the veiling emission ( section 3.2 ) and use a least - squares minimization to solve for the amount of veiling and reddening for that template .",
    "we then repeat this procedure for several templates to find the best solution .",
    "for the template spectra , we choose weak emission t tauri stars acquired with the same instrumentation .",
    "the best templates are those that leave no residual spectral features when the model ( template plus veiling ) is subtracted from the object .    to make first estimates for the stellar spectral type and reddening , we measure continuum magnitudes and spectral indices for strong absorption lines . for comparison , we derive continuum magnitudes and absorption indices for nearby stars with known spectral types @xcite .",

    "fig .  2 ( see also @xcite )",
    "shows that the graph of cah vs. tio @xmath127675 provides a reasonable first estimate for the spectral types of pre - main sequence stars because the ratio of these indices is insensitive to gravity .",
    "the @xmath14@xmath15 color then provides an initial estimate for the reddening of each star . for wtts , the @xmath16 derived from @xmath17 agrees with estimates derived from v  r or j  k to @xmath7 0.10.2 mag . for ctts ,",
    "the derived @xmath16 is sensitive to the veiling .",
    "we use the veiling model to improve reddening and spectral type estimates as we derive the veiling .",
    "table 2 compiles the equivalent widths for the brightest emission lines .",
    "uncertainties in the location of the continuum , measured by fitting the continuum at different levels , dominate the errors in the tabulated values for the emission lines .",

    "to derive error estimates for the model parameters , we use a monte carlo technique based on the flux error estimate @xmath38 . for each of @xmath41 to @xmath42 monte carlo trials , we add noise to each point of the observed spectrum and repeat the amoeba solution .",

    "each panel of the figure includes the dereddened spectrum ( top curve ) , the spectrum of the normalized template star ( middle curve ) , and the residual spectrum ( lower curve ) . when the residual spectrum is zero at all wavelengths , the veiling spectrum is the difference between the observed spectrum and the normalized template spectrum . in stars with little or no veiling , spectra of the veiling emission and the photosphere nearly coincide .",
    "aside from strong emission lines and occasional absorption features , the residual spectrum is nearly zero for almost all tts . a few tts , such as the primary and secondary of df tau , display absorption features in the residual spectrum due to template mismatch",

    "the main goal of this project is to determine how disk accretion behaves in close binary systems .",
    "our data are well - suited to compare primary disks with those of their secondaries , because we have spectra of each component and can therefore estimate the reddening , veiling , luminosities , masses , ages , mass accretion rates throughout the sample . in many cases",

    "our sample deliberately avoids single stars , and so is not representative of the stellar population as a whole . for these reasons , in this paper we compare disk properties _ within each pair _ to try to gain some understanding about accretion in binaries .",
    "one of the most basic questions about young binaries is whether or not a disk exists around one or both of the stars .",
    "although most binaries consist of two ctts or two wtts , about 15%  of young binaries are ` mixed pairs ' that have a ctts and a wtts @xcite .",

    "stars where one of the disk indicators disagrees with the other three provide useful insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each of the criteria .",
    "nine stars ( 22% of the sample ) fall into this category .",
    "the least reliable indicator seems to be [ o  i ] , which gives a false negative ( i.e. , no [ o  i ] but all other disk signatures are present ) in 4 cases .",
    "the lack of [ o  i ] for these ctts may simply be signal to noise  it is usually much easier to see the [ o  i ] in the medium resolution spectrum than in the low resolution one because [ o  i ] stands out more from the continuum in the medium resolution spectrum .",
    "the m2.0 star v807 tau  s , gives a false positive ; it has strong [ o  i ] but no other disk signatures .",
    "we have no explanation for this anomaly .",
    "similarly , the secondary of is tau , an m3.5 , has weak [ o  i ] but lacks other indications of a disk ( the ew(h@xmath0 ) of 24  falls just below our cutoff for a ctts ) .    the h@xmath0 , veiling , and ir - excess tests are each fairly reliable , but none are foolproof . for example , the h@xmath0 test gives a false negative for the secondary of v955 tau ( 6 , m2.5 ) , which is a ctts according to the [ o  i ] emission and ir excess .",
    "had we used the h@xmath0 ctts criteria of @xcite there would be three false positives , but we have avoided these by increasing the ew(h@xmath0 ) cutoff for ctts to 25  from 20  for the latest spectral types .",
    "veiling works about as well as h@xmath0 , giving false positives for the secondaries of v927 tau ( r=0.09@xmath70.03 ) and v999 tau ( r=0.29@xmath70.05 ) .",
    "the photosphere of the latter is apparently anomalous . in general",
    ", veiling is easier to measure in later - type stars than in earlier - types because the temperature differences between the accretion spots and the photospheres are higher when the photospheres are cool .",
    "finally , @xmath54 k@xmath10l fails only in the primary of fq tau ( m3.0 ) , which shows no ir excess despite having relatively strong veiling and [ o  i ] emission , as well as an h@xmath0 equivalent width of over 100 . unlike veiling ,",
    "ir excesses are less sensitive to the presence of a disk when the photosphere is very red , so it is not too surprising that very red ctts sometimes lack excesses ( see also the secondary of fo tau below ) .",
    "four stars ( 10% of the sample ) in table 7 show two ctts indicators and two wtts indicators .",
    "the primary of v807 tau is a k5 star with a large ir excess and an h@xmath0 equivalent width of @xmath73 7 , so we classify this as a ctts .",
    "the lack of veiling is not particularly worrisome because the photosphere is relatively blue , and there are at least four other ctts without [ o  i ] ( see above ) .",
    "the primary of v955  tau is another relatively blue star ( k7 ) that has no detectable veiling or [ o  i ] , but satisfies the ctts classification with 11  h@xmath0 equivalent width and a large k@xmath10l excess ; we also classify this star as ctts .",
    "as described above , its secondary has strong [ o  i ] and a moderate infrared excess but lacks veiling and has weak h@xmath0 .",
    "we classify this borderline case as a ctts .",
    "finally , the secondary of fo tau must also be a ctts ; this m3.5 star has an h@xmath0 equivalent width of 95  and a significant amount of veiling .",
    "we attribute the lack of ir excess to its cool photosphere , and the lack of [ o  i ] simply brings the total number of ctts in that category up to seven .    with these classifications , we have 12 ctts pairs , 5 wtts pairs , and 4 mixed pairs .",
    "the mixed pairs are fq tau , fv tau / c , is tau , and v807 tau ; the ctts is the primary except in fv tau / c . however , fv tau / c is not anomalous , as other examples of mixed pairs where the ctts is the secondary exist in the literature @xcite .",
    "this frequency of mixed pairs among the close binaries is essentially identical to that found for wider binaries with larger samples ( * ? ? ?",
    "* wg01 ) .",
    "figure 5 shows the mass accretion rates of all pairs that have at least one veiled component . ignoring the fv / fvc point , which plots the widely separated primaries of these close binaries ,",
    "the mass accretion rates of the primaries are correlated with those of their secondaries .",
    "hence , the disks around the closely separated systems that comprise our sample are not independent of one another .",
    "the significance of this correlation is very high  a spearman rank of 0.816 for 15 points occurs with a probablility of less than @xmath75 in uncorrelated data . surprisingly , though the mass accretion rates of the primaries exceed those of the secondaries in several cases , most of the sample points lie close to the line of equal mass accretion rates .",
    "in fact , when considered per unit mass ( bottom panel in fig .  5 ) ,",
    "secondaries appear somewhat more active than primaries do , on average .",
    "the h@xmath0 luminosity of all pairs in the sample ( fig .",
    "6 , top panel ) also shows that activity levels of the primaries and secondaries are correlated .",
    "considering the sample as a whole is not particularly useful however , because the paucity of mixed pairs implies a dearth of points in the lower right and upper left portions of the graph , and this fact alone produces a correlation between the two variables .",
    "a more interesting test is to compare the correlation among the ctts pairs ( solid squares in the figure ) .",
    "a correlation does exist among ctts , although there are only 12 points in this subsample .",
    "the h@xmath0 correlation exists at a 99%  confidence level according to a spearman rank test .",
    "most pairs lie to the right of the line in the top panel of fig .",
    "6 ; primaries have larger intrinsic h@xmath0 luminosities than secondaries do in the majority of pairs .    when the h@xmath0 luminosities are normalized by the stellar luminosities , the correlation among the ctts subsample vanishes , although it remains for the entire sample .",
    "hence , the correlation in h@xmath0 among the ctts in fig .  6 results from a correlation in stellar luminosities , which in turn arises because primaries and secondaries tend to be coeval ( see section 5 ) .",
    "our data are particularly well - suited to examine infrared excesses from colors because the extinction and the spectral types , both of which affect colors , are known for all the stars .",
    "the k@xmath10l excesses in the bottom half of fig .",
    "6 also correlate for the primaries and secondaries , but , as for the h@xmath0 luminosities , this correlation is more interesting for the ctts subsample .",
    "a weak correlation between the k@xmath10l excesses of the primaries and their secondaries , but this correlation rests entirely upon two points , xz  tau and fs  tau .",
    "the correlation exists at the 98%  confidence level , but without xz  tau and fs  tau the confidence drops to @xmath5 80% .",
    "k@xmath10l excesses arise in part from accretion in the disk , and correlate with veiling @xcite ; hence , a correlation of k@xmath10l colors within a pair is likely to arise from the accretion rate correlations between primaries and their secondaries .",
    "extinctions of primaries and their secondaries correlate ( fig .",
    "7 ) , as expected for stars that lie along a nearly common sight line through a dark cloud .",
    "the correlation in extinctions is very strong , with a confidence level of @xmath73 99.99% .",
    "however , in six pairs ( gh  tau , uz  tau - w , uy  aur , dd  tau , v999  tau , and fv",
    "tau / c ) , the reddening of the secondary is significantly larger than that of the primary .",
    "only one of these , v999  tau , is a wtts pair ; fv  tau / c has a wtts primary and ctts secondary , while the components of the other four pairs are all ctts .",
    "as noted above , the photosphere of v999  tau  s appears anomalous , so it is possible that the extinction may be more uncertain there . ignoring the fv / fvc point , which refers to the primaries of the fv  tau and fv  tau / c systems and as such is a wide binary ,",
    "there are only a couple of marginal cases of a primary that appears more reddened than its secondary .",
    "the tendency of some secondaries to have more extinction than their primaries has a fairly simple geometric interpretation for close binaries if the orbital plane of the binary differs from that of the disk around the primary . in such systems",
    "the secondary will be seen through the disk of the primary over part of its orbit .",
    "if disks around primaries are , on average , more massive than those around secondaries , then secondaries seen through the disks of their primaries will experience a significant amount of additional extinction that would be less noticeable for a primary seen through the disk of its secondary . because fv  tau / c is a mixed pair with a wtts primary , additional local extinction around the secondary must either arise from the disk of the secondary or from an extended envelope around the primary that lacks an inner disk .",
    "more close pairs are needed to test if this trend of more highly reddened secondaries is real .",
    "the binaries in our sample are plotted in an hr diagram together with the pre - main - sequence evolutionary tracks of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite in figs .",
    "8 , 9 , and 10 , respectively .",
    "although most of the secondaries are less luminous than their primaries , two pairs ( xz  tau and fs  tau ) have more luminous secondaries which must be significantly younger than their primaries .",
    "the secondary of xz  tau dominates the mid - ir emission from the pair @xcite , and both xz  tau and fs  tau are surrounded by reflection nebulae .",
    "it is possible that the reflected light increases the apparent luminosities of the secondaries , thereby decreasing their ages .",
    "the reflection nebulae indicate that the environments of these binaries are very dusty , so it is conceivable that large grains in the immediate vicinity of the primary produce a more grey reddening law , which would increase the extinction and make the primary appear erroneously old .",
    "for this effect to equalize ages it would have to act in the primary but not the secondary .",
    "there is no direct evidence to support this scenario .",
    "uncertainties of the stellar luminosities are dominated by systematic errors , and are about 0.2 in log l.    as fig .",
    "11 shows , there is no clear correlation between the amplitude of @xmath54 log l@xmath55 , the amount in log l that the secondary must shift to be coeval with the primary , and the mass ratio .",
    "secondaries tend to be younger than primaries for both the siess00 and palla00 tracks ( the bcah98 tracks in fig .",
    "8 can not be used because they do not extend to high enough masses or young enough ages ) . in pairs such as dd tau where the primary and secondary have the same spectral type , and the tracks are nearly vertical in the hr diagram , the primary and secondary",
    "will have the same mass but the primary will always appear younger because by our definition the star we call the primary is the more luminous one at 7000 .",
    "hence , any statistics about age differences between primaries and secondaries must eliminate these systems .",
    "ignoring such pairs , and leaving out the wide binary fv / fvc , the palla00 tracks have 13 pairs where the secondary is younger and only 3 where it is older .",
    "the corresponding numbers for the siess00 tracks are 12 and 4 , respectively .",
    "this trend for the secondaries to be younger is unlikely to be caused by random errors .",
    "the chance that at least 13 out of 16 pairs in a coeval sample have the secondary younger owing to random errors is only 1.1% ; the chance for at least 12 out of 16 pairs is 3.8% .",
    "wg01 noted that the age differences between components within a binary were significantly less than those obtained by randomly pairing stars within their sample .",
    "this correlation between the ages of primaries and secondaries is quite clear in fig .  12 , and exists at the @xmath76 level for the palla00 tracks and at the @xmath77 level for the siess00 tracks ( fig .",
    "12 shows only the siess00 tracks , because these are the only ones with young enough isochrones for our sample ) .",
    "the points in fig .",
    "11 also show the age correlation indirectly  the standard deviation of @xmath54 log  l@xmath55 is @xmath1 0.28 for both sets of tracks , but should be 0.51 if the stars in the sample were paired randomly .    if , on average , secondaries formed some time after their primaries ( for example from instabilities in the primary s disk @xcite ) , then the age differences should be largest on a log @xmath51 plot for the youngest pairs because the fractional age difference declines as the pair ages .",
    "12 does not show this trend  the two oldest primaries have the largest age differences from their secondaries .",
    "one possible explanation for the younger ages of secondaries may be disk accretion @xcite . if a 0.1 m@xmath6 star were to accrete an additional 0.1 m@xmath6 on a timescale short compared to the age of the star",
    ", the new 0.2 m@xmath6 star is in some sense half as old as it once was . for this case of a mass - weighted age , the effect of accretion on age should depend upon @xmath53/m ( bottom panel of fig .",
    "5 ) , where secondaries appear somewhat more active than primaries , on average .",
    "however , the difference between primaries and secondaries in fig .  5 is less than a factor of two , and the effects of accretion on the location of a star in the hr diagram is a complex problem ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "there is no evidence that the secondaries continue to accrete matter after the primary has stopped accreting ",
    "if this were the case then most of the mixed pairs should have a ctts secondary and a wtts primary , which they do not .",
    "although no set of pre - main sequence tracks can make all the pairs coeval , the points in fig .",
    "12 would fall more closely on the line of equal ages if the isochrones were a little less steep in the hr diagram .",
    "such behavior is indeed predicted by some of the accretion models of @xcite . with the exception of the primary of fs  tau and possibly the primary of v955  tau , all of the stars lie on the convective portion of the tracks .",
    "one advantage of studying close binaries is that they are sometimes surrounded by rotating molecular disks in keplerian orbits , so the combined mass of the system can be estimated independently from the evolutionary tracks .",
    "the closest pairs also show substantial orbital motion over a few years , which leads to a mass estimate for the binary .",
    "dynamical masses from disk orbital motion have now been measured accurately around a few t  tauri stars @xcite .",
    "the best example is probably gg  tau , which has a dynamical mass of 1.28 @xmath7 0.07 m@xmath6 , somewhat larger than the 0.98 m@xmath6 derived from the the location of the primary and secondary in the hr diagram using either the @xcite tracks or the @xcite tracks .",
    "if we take these numbers at face value , then an additional mass of 0.30 m@xmath6 must be in the system but not in the stars .",
    "this extra mass is about 30%  of the stellar masses , and seems large for disks , especially in a relatively unobscured system like gg  tau .",
    "a circumbinary disk also exists around uy  aur with a dynamical mass of @xmath1 1.2 m@xmath6 @xcite ; the combined mass of the system using the siess00 tracks is 0.94 m@xmath6 . following the assumptions described in the notes for fs tau leads to 1.2 m@xmath6 in that system , again larger than the combined mass of 0.89 m@xmath6 in table  5",
    ".    dynamical masses of t tauri systems continue to improve as better orbits are measured for close binaries .",
    "the current data imply that discrepancies between the dynamical masses and stellar masses are significant .",
    "either the dynamical masses are too large , or the stellar masses too small ; the latter could indicate a problem with the evolutionary tracks or the effective temperature scales , while errors in dynamical masses could easily arise from uncertain distances .",
    "for example , a 10%  decrease in the distance to taurus ( to 126  pc ) would decrease dynamical masses by @xmath1 30% , but would have little effect on the spectral masses because the pre - main - sequence tracks are nearly vertical in the hr diagram for low mass stars , and changing the distance affects the luminosity but not the effective temperature of the star .",
    "this paper reports the results of a spectroscopic survey of 20 close ( subarcsecond ) binary t tauri stars in the taurus - auriga dark cloud done with stis on the hubble space telescope . by obtaining spectra of each component",
    "it is possible to determine the reddening , spectral types , and stellar luminosities of the primaries and secondaries in all the pairs .",
    "this information suffices to place each star in the hr diagram , which determines its mass and age . when combined with disk characteristics such as mass accretion rates measured from veiling emission , and including emission line luminosities and infrared color excesses , it is possible to address many of the outstanding questions regarding binary formation in systems where the stellar separations are less than the extent of the circumstellar disks .",
    "such systems are not only interesting from the standpoint of accretion dynamics , but also make up the most common mode of star formation in our galaxy .    components of close binaries share common characteristics in a number of ways . correlations in mass accretion rates particularly stand out  the best place to look for a rapidly accreting secondary is next to a rapidly accreting primary .",
    "the actual values of the accretion rates are remarkably similar between primaries and secondaries .",
    "because secondaries are less luminous than their primaries in most cases , it is often easier to see accretion signatures such as emission lines and veiling around secondaries than it is around primaries . on average",
    ", secondaries actually accrete more per unit mass than their primaries do .",
    "other accretion signatures such as h@xmath0 emission and color excesses also correlate within pairs , probably as a result of the correlation of these quantities with mass accretion rates .",
    "extinctions of primaries correlate well with those of their secondaries , as expected .",
    "we have examined four independent signatures of disks : h@xmath0 emission , k@xmath10l color excesses , veiling and [ o  i ] in each of our objects , and have devised rules each of these signatures must satisfy to classify a star as a ctts .",
    "most stars are clearly a ctts or a wtts , but several have at least one misleading indicator , most often [ o  i ] although each of the four signatures is inaccurate in at least one case .",
    "overall , the frequency of mixed pairs , where one star is a ctts and one a wtts , comprise about the same fraction among close pairs as they do among wider pairs .",
    "several subtle trends have emerged from the data set . when extinctions differ within a pair it is usually the secondary that is more heavily obscured .",
    "one can explain this result geometrically by having a larger , more opaque disk around the primary than exists around the secondary .",
    "ages of primaries and secondaries also clearly correlate , and are equal to within the errors in most cases .",
    "however , there is a clear tendency for secondaries to be a bit younger than their primaries .",
    "slightly flatter isochrones in the pre - main - sequence tracks , perhaps caused by ongoing accretion , would remove this bias .",
    "however , pairs such as fs  tau and xz  tau have more luminous secondaries that will be very difficult to make coeval with their primaries for any set of tracks .",
    "masses of the pairs inferred from their locations in the hr diagram are @xmath1 30% less than those measured from rotating keplerian disks or from the orbital motion within the binary .",
    "these discrepancies are most easily removed by reducing the distance to taurus by about 10%  to @xmath1 126  pc , but can also be accomplished in other ways , such as altering the effective temperature scale for cool photospheres or by generating a substantially different set of pre - main - sequence tracks .",

    "<S> mass accretion rates of primaries and secondaries are strongly correlated , and h@xmath0 luminosities , ir excesses , and ages also correlate within pairs . </S>",
