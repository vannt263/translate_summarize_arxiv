    "since the superposition principle is satisfied the exponential metric predicts no black holes , but rather stable compact objects with no event horizon and very large , but finite , gravitational redshift ( dark red holes \" ) .",
    "this suggests that gravitational field for those objects effectively becomes repulsive at large gravitational potential .",
    "here we analyze properties of compact objects at galactic centers and show that they are in favour of the exponential metric .",
    "our conclusion is based on a quantitative analysis which is independent of the particular choice of the time - dependent theory of gravity @xcite .",
    "this is possible because the main part of the bubble dynamics we use for the quantitative comparison occurs in the well - tested limit of newtonian gravity .",
    "only a small part of the trajectory near the lower radius turning point ( where gravity effectively becomes repulsive ) is beyond newtonian description . as a result ,",

    "due to spherical symmetry there is no radiation of gravitation waves .",

    "one dimension solitons , contrary to 2d or 3d , are stable and preserve their shape under reflection from a boundary .",
    "because a thin - wall bubble surface can be treated as a 1d soliton this insures its very long life time .",

    "deviation of the problem from 1d leads to slow decay of the soliton by emission of particles ( axions ) .",
