    "the last decade has witnessed a tremendous amount of research efforts in the physics of atomic bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) @xcite .",
    "the study of becs has yielded a wide array of interesting phenomena , not only because of very precise experimental control that exists over the relevant experimental procedures @xcite , but also because of the intimate connections of the description of dilute - gas becs with other areas of physics , such as superfluidity , superconductivity , lasers and coherent optics , nonlinear optics , and nonlinear wave theory .",
    "of particular emphasis in much experimental and theoretical work is the setting of a bec trapped in periodic potentials , usually combined with an additional harmonic trapping potential . from the standpoint of nonlinear interactions , mathematical descriptions of becs held in purely harmonic traps",
    "are now well known . nevertheless ,",
    "apart from studies focusing on the transition between superfluidity and an insulator state @xcite , relatively little attention has been given to an understanding of the varieties of many - body states that may possibly exist with intermediate lattice strengths , where phase coherence is maintained across the sample .",
    "a more complete understanding of bec behavior in such lattice potentials is relevant and important to current work with becs , and to an even broader array of topics , in particular discrete nonlinear optics and nonlinear wave theories .",
    "such regimes of bec physics are experimentally and theoretically accessible , and comparisons between theoretical and experimental results are certainly possible . here",
    ", we present a theoretical stability examination of becs with either attractive or repulsive interatomic interactions in a combined harmonic and periodic potential .",
    "many of the common elements between becs and other areas of physics , and in particular optics , originate in the existence of macroscopic coherence in the many - body state of the system .",
    "mathematically , bec dynamics are therefore often accurately described by a mean - field model , namely a partial differential equation of the nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) type , the so - called gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation @xcite .",
    "the gp equation is particularly successful in drawing connections between bec physics , nonlinear optics and nonlinear wave theories , with vortices and solitary waves examples of common elements between these areas .",
    "the gp equation is a classical nonlinear evolution equation ( with the nonlinearity originating from the interatomic interactions ) and , as such , it permits the study of a variety of interesting nonlinear phenomena .",
    "these phenomena have primarily been studied by treating the condensate as a purely nonlinear coherent matter - wave , i.e. , from the viewpoint of the nonlinear dynamics of solitary waves .",
    "relevant studies have already been summarized in various books ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) and reviews ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite for bright matter - wave solitons , @xcite for vortices in becs , @xcite for dynamical instabilities in becs , @xcite for nonlinear dynamics of becs in optical lattices ) .",
    "on the other hand , many static and dynamic properties of becs confined in various types of external potentials can be studied by starting from the non - interacting limit , where the nonlinearity is considered to be negligible .",
    "the basic idea of such an approach is that in the absence of interactions the gp equation is reduced to a linear schrdinger equation for a confined single - particle state ; in this limit , and in the case of , e.g. , a harmonic external potential , the linear problem becomes the equation for the quantum harmonic oscillator characterized by discrete energies and corresponding eigenmodes @xcite . exploiting this simple physical picture",
    ", one may then use analytical and/or numerical techniques for the _ continuation _ of these linear eigenmodes supported by the particular type of the external trapping potential into nonlinear states as the interactions become stronger .",
    "this idea has been explored at the level of one - dimensional ( 1d ) @xcite and higher - dimensional states @xcite in the case of a harmonic trapping potential , where nonlinear stationary modes were found from a continuation of the ( linear ) states of the quantum harmonic oscillator .",
    "the same problem has been studied in the framework of the so - called feshbach resonance management technique in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a linear temporal variation of the nonlinearity was considered .",
    "the continuation of the linear states to their nonlinear counterparts has also been explored from the point of view of bifurcation and stability theory @xcite .",
    "finally , in the same spirit but in the two - dimensional ( 2d ) setting , radially symmetric nonlinear states of harmonically trapped `` pancake - shaped ''",
    "condensates were recently investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "importantly , all of the above studies provide a clear physical picture of how genuinely nonlinear states of harmonically confined becs ( such as dark and bright matter - wave solitons in 1d or ring solitons and vortices in 2d ) , are connected to and emanate from the eigenmodes of the quantum harmonic oscillator .",
    "similar considerations also hold for becs confined in optical lattices . in this case",
    ", pertinent nonlinear stationary states ( such as spatially extended nonlinear bloch waves , truncated nonlinear bloch waves , matter - wave gap solitons in 1d , and gap vortices in 2d and 3d ) , can be understood by the structure of the band - gap spectrum of the linear bloch waves supported in the non - interacting limit ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) . however , there are only few studies for condensates confined in _ both _ harmonic and optical lattice potentials , and these are basically devoted to the dynamics of particular nonlinear structures ( such as dark @xcite and bright @xcite solitons in 1d , and vortices in 2d @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the structure of condensates confined in such superpositions of harmonic and periodic potentials remains , to the best of our knowledge , largely unexplored .",
    "nevertheless , such a study is particularly relevant to current work with becs , and even suggests new avenues for exploration . in particular",
    ", one might ask whether the addition of a weak optical lattice might increase the stability of excited states that are known to be unstable in harmonic traps .",
    "stability , if it is found , may add new realistic options for the engineering of new quantum states of becs",
    ". it may also be interesting to investigate the mott insulator transition by starting from a stable excited state of a weak optical lattice . also , the transport of excited states ( which is not discussed in this paper ) through a lattice structure may have application in future bec interferometry experiments .",
    "finally , the advances of far - off - resonant optical trapping techniques allow for the creation of strongly pancake - shaped condensates that may be confined by harmonic and spatially periodic components , and we expect that the theoretical considerations described here may be directly explored using current experimental techniques .    our aim in the present work is to contribute to this direction and study the structure and the stability of a pancake - shaped condensate confined by the combination of a harmonic trap and a periodic potential , with periodicity in two orthogonal directions .",
    "we will adopt the above mentioned approach of continuation of linear states to nonlinear ones , thus providing a host of interesting solutions that have not been explored previously and yet should be tractable within presently available experimental settings .",
    "in particular , our analysis starts by first considering the non - interacting limit . in this regime",
    ", we employ a multiscale perturbation method ( which uses the harmonic trap strength as a formal small parameter ) to find the discrete energies and the corresponding eigenmodes of the pertinent single - particle schrdinger equation with the combined harmonic and periodic potential .",
    "we then use this linear limit as a starting point for initializing a 2d `` nonlinear solver '' that identifies the relevant stationary nonlinear eigenstates as a function of the chemical potential ( i.e. , the nonlinearity strength ) and of the optical lattice depth .",
    "once the basic structure of the condensate is found , we subsequently perform a linear stability analysis of the nonlinear modes that can be initiated by the non - interacting ground and first few excited states . when nonlinear states are found to be unstable ,",
    "we use direct numerical simulations to study their dynamics and monitor the evolution of the relevant instability .",
    "essential results that will be presented below are the following : for a fixed harmonic trap strength , there exist certain regions in the parameter plane defined by the chemical potential and the optical lattice depth , where not only the ground state , but also excited states are stable or only weakly unstable .",
    "particularly , an excited state with a shape resembling an out - of - phase matter - wave soliton pair ( for attractive interactions ) is found to persist for long times , being stable ( weakly unstable ) for attractive ( repulsive ) interatomic interactions .",
    "thus , the ground state and the aforementioned excited state have a good chance to be observed in a real experiment with either attractive or repulsive pancake becs .",
    "similar conclusions can be drawn for more complex states , such as a quadrupolar one which may also be stable in the attractive case , however , higher excited states are typically more prone to instabilities , as is shown in our detailed numerics below .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we present the model and study analytically the non - interacting regime .",
    "the continuation of the linear states to the nonlinear ones , as well as the stability properties of the nonlinear states are presented in section iii . finally , in section iv",
    ", we summarize our findings and present our conclusions .",
    "at sufficiently low temperatures , and in the framework of the mean - field approach , the condensate dynamics can be described by the order parameter @xmath0 .",
    "we assume that the condensate is kept in a highly anisotropic trap , with the transverse ( @xmath1 ) and longitudinal ( @xmath2 ) trapping frequencies chosen so that @xmath3 .",
    "in such a case , the condensate has a nearly planar , so - called `` pancake '' shape ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite for relevant experimental realizations ) , which allows us to assume a separable wave function , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the ground state of the respective quantum harmonic oscillator .",
    "then , averaging of the underlying three - dimensional ( 3d ) gp equation along the longitudinal direction @xmath2 @xcite leads to the following 2d gp equation for the transverse component of the wave function ( see also refs .",

    "this feature will weakly affect the quantitative aspects of the results that follow ( in essence , providing an error bar in the estimates below of @xmath126 and similar for the eigenvalues @xmath14 introduced below ) , but is essentially necessary , given the limitations of standard eigenvalue solvers for such big jacobian eigenvalue problems .",

    "the real part @xmath130 of the eigenvalue then determines the growth rate of the potential instability of the solution , since for positive real values the perturbation will grow exponentially in time .",

    "this instability for large @xmath99 is something that may be expected in the case of attractive interactions under consideration , as the corresponding 2d gp equation for an a homogeneous bec ( i.e. , without any external potential ) is well - known to be subject to collapse @xcite .",

    "@xcite for @xmath142 which is not shown here ) . essentially , the potential appears to _ stabilize _ the solitary wave against dispersion in this regime ( i.e. , close to the linear limit ) , but can not stabilize it against the catastrophic collapse - type instability .",
    "furthermore , in the presence of the optical lattice we can observe that there is always a range of chemical potentials for which the condensate is stabilized , in accordance with what was originally suggested in ref .",

    "all excited states presented in the previous section were predicted to be unstable , and this is confirmed in this section . in the particular case of the state @xmath144 which was found to be weakly unstable ( see bottom row of fig .",
    "[ vfig4 ] ) , the instability takes a considerable time to manifest itself .",
    "the evolution of this state is depicted in panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ df_dyno ] ; it is clearly seen that the state persists up to @xmath145 . on the other hand , panel ( a ) shows the evolution of the state @xmath79 which persists up to @xmath146 , while the bottom row of panels shows the dynamics of the ( c ) @xmath81 state and of the ( d ) @xmath82 , both persisting also up to @xmath146 .",
    "all of these excited states degenerate into ground - state - like configurations .",
    "notice that transient vortex - like structures seem to appear during this process but they do not persist in the eventual dynamics and are hence not further discussed here .",
    "in summary , we have studied the structure and the stability of a pancake - shaped condensate ( with either attractive or repulsive interatomic interactions ) confined in a potential with both a harmonic and an optical lattice component .",
    "starting from the non - interacting limit , and exploiting the smallness of the harmonic trap strength , we have employed a multiscale perturbation method to find the discrete energies and the corresponding eigenmodes of the pertinent 2d linear schrdinger equation .",
    "then , we used the results found in this linear ( non - interacting ) limit in order to identify states persisting in the nonlinear ( interacting ) regime as well .",
    "this investigation revealed that the most fundamental states ( emanating from combinations of the ground state and the first few excited states in the two orthogonal directions of the optical lattice ) can indeed be continued in the nonlinear regime . to demonstrate this continuation , we used two - parameter diagrams involving the effective strength of the nonlinearity ( through the chemical potential ) and the optical lattice depth .",
    "excited states were typically found to be unstable .",
    "the instability was found to result in either wavefunction collapse or a robust single - lobed structure in the case of attractive interactions ; on the other hand , in the case of repulsive interactions , the instability was always found to lead to the ground state of the system .",
    "nevertheless , noteworthy exceptions of stable or very weakly unstable states were also revealed .",
    "these include the @xmath144 and the @xmath81 states in the case of attractive interatomic interactions .",
    "moreover , in the case of repulsive interactions , the same state , @xmath144 , was found ( in certain parameter regimes ) to be only very weakly unstable .",
    "direct numerical simulations confirmed that the instability of this state is indeed weak , and it manifests itself at large times , an order of magnitude larger than the ones pertaining to the manifestation of instabilities of other excited states .",
    "thus , it is clear that the obtained results suggest that the state @xmath144 has a good chance to be observed in experiments with either an attractive or a repulsive pancake condensate .",
    "it is especially important to highlight that these states are stabilized ( or quasi - stabilized ) only in the presence of a sufficiently strong optical lattice ; hence the latter potential plays a _",
    "critical _ role in determining the stability of the states presented herein .",
    "as described in section iii b , the parameters used in our analysis have been chosen in order to facilitate convenience of the numerical computations , while also within range of experimentally achievable limits of atom number , chemical potential , harmonic oscillator frequencies , and optical lattice depth and periodicity .",
    "furthermore , we believe that the stability and spatial structure of the states examined here can be examined experimentally . for example , we imagine utilizing a bec held in a pancake - shaped harmonic trap , created by an optical field . by using an optical trap rather than a magnetic trap , the scattering length of a bec may be adjusted using a feshbach resonance .",
    "we envision that an optical lattice potential is ramped on and superimposed on a bec with an interatomic scattering length tuned to be near zero .",
    "once the lattice has reached the desired depth , the scattering length can be further adjusted with a magnetic field to be either positive or negative ( the latter option would need to be within a region of stability that does not result in collapse of the bec ) .",
    "finally , phase imprinting techniques @xcite can be used to generate the desired phase profile of the bec . by optically examining the state of the bec at various points in time after phase profile imprinting , the stability of the generated states",
    "can then be examined and compared with our numerical results and stability analysis .",
    "for example , with an optical lattice frequency of @xmath147 hz ( as in the example of section iii b ) , the time unit of our dynamical evolution plots is 1.3 ms .",
    "this implies that for the cases we have examined , signatures of instability would be typically visible on the experimentally feasible 10 to 100 ms timescale .",
    "we therefore believe that our predictions could be examined with current experimental techniques .",
    "there are various directions along which one can extend the present considerations .",
    "a natural one is to extend the analysis to fully 3d condensates and examine the persistence and stability of higher - dimensional variants of the presented states .",
    "a perhaps more subtle direction is to consider a different basis of linear eigenfunctions in the 2d problem , namely instead of the hermite - gauss basis used here , to focus on the laguerre - gauss basis of the underlying linear problem with the parabolic potential .",
    "under such a choice , it would be interesting to examine how solutions of that type , including one - node and multi - node ring - like structures ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , are deformed in the presence of the lattice and how their stability is correspondingly affected .",
    "finally , as discussed above , it appears that the setting considered herein should be directly accessible to present experiments with pancake - shaped becs .",
    "in view of that , it would be particularly relevant to examine which ones among the structures presented in this work can survive for evolution times that are of interest within the time scales of an experiment .",
