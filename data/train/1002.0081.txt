    "the diffuse galactic emission ( dge ) arises from interactions of cosmic - rays ( crs ) with interstellar gas and radiation field in the galaxy . due to the smooth nature of the interstellar radiation field and the cr flux after propagation",
    ", the fine structure of the dge is determined by the structure of the interstellar gas .",
    "getting the distribution of the interstellar gas correct is therefore crucial when modeling the dge .",
    "it is generally assumed that galactic crs are accelerated in interstellar shocks and then propagate throughout the galaxy ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * for a recent review . ) . in this paper ,",
    "cr propagation and corresponding diffuse emission is calculated using the galprop code ( see * ? ? ? * and references within . ) .",
    "we use the so - called conventional galprop model @xcite , where the cr injection spectra and the diffusion parameters are chosen such that the cr flux agrees with the locally observed one after propagation .",
    "the gas distribution is given as galacto - centric annuli and the diffuse emission is calculated for those same annuli .",
    "the distribution of h i is determined from the 21-cm lab line survey @xcite while distribution of molecular hydrogen , h@xmath1 , is found using the co ( @xmath2 ) survey of @xcite assuming @xmath3 .",
    "while converting observations of the 21-cm h i line to column density is theoretically possible , it is not practically feasible . to correctly account for the optical depth of the emitting h i gas",
    ", one must know its spin temperature , @xmath0 ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . under the assumption of a constant @xmath0 along the line of sight ,",
    "the column density of h i can be calculated from the observed brightness temperature @xmath4 using @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the background continuum temperature and @xmath7 @xmath8 k ( km / s)@xmath9 .",
    "the assumption of a constant @xmath0 along the line of sight is known to be wrong for many directions in the galaxy ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the @xmath0 values derived in this paper are therefore only a global average and should not be taken at face value .",
    "figure  [ fig : tsratio ] shows how changing @xmath0 affects @xmath10 in a non - linear way , mainly affecting areas with @xmath4 close to @xmath0 in the galactic plane .",
    "this figure was created under the assumption of a fixed @xmath0 for the whole galaxy that is known to be wrong but has been used for dge analysis from the days of cos - b @xcite .",
    "note that for equation  ( [ eq : opticaldepthcorrection ] ) to be valid the condition @xmath11 must hold .",
    "when generating the gas annuli , this condition is forced by clipping the value of @xmath4 .    while the assumption of a constant spin temperature @xmath12 for the whole galaxy may have been sufficient for older instrument , it is no longer acceptable for a new generation experiment like fermi - lat @xcite .",
    "this has been partially explored for the outer galaxy in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will show a better assumption for @xmath0 can be easily found and also show that direct observations of @xmath0 using absorption measurement of bright radio sources are needed for accurate dge modeling .     in galactic coordinates .",
    "the figure clearly shows the non - linearity of the correction that can be as high as a factor of 2 in this case.,width=283 ]",
    "we assume the source distribution of cr nuclei and electrons are the same .",
    "cr propagation is handled by galprop and we use the conventional model so that after the propagation the cr spectra agree with local observations .",
    "the galprop diffuse emission is output in galacto - centric annuli , split up into different components corresponding to different processes ( bremsstrahlung , @xmath13-decay , and inverse compton scattering ) . to allow for radial variations in cr intensity",
    "we perform a full sky maximum likelihood fit , preserving the spectral shape of each component .",
    "we allow for one global normalization factor for the electron to proton ratio .",
    "additionally , we also allow for radial variation in the @xmath14 factor .",
    "this accounts for uncertainties in the cr source distribution and @xmath14 factor .",
    "the maximum likelihood fits were performed on the whole sky using the gardian package @xcite after preparing the fermi - lat data with the science tools .",
    "we use the same dataset as @xcite that has special cuts to reduce cr background contamination compared to the standard event selection @xcite .",
    "in addition to the dge model , we also include all sources from the 1 year fermi - lat source list @xcite and an isotropic component to account for egb emission and particle contamination .",
    "this fit is performed for different assumptions of @xmath0 and a likelihood ratio test is used to compare the quality of the fits .",
    "the simplest assumption is that of a constant @xmath0 for the whole galaxy and it deserves some attention for historical reasons .",
    "it will also serve as a baseline model for comparison with other assumptions . to get an approximation for the best model",
    ", we scan @xmath0 from 110 k to 150 k in 5 k steps .",
    "our results show that @xmath15 gives the maximum likelihood for this setup .",
    "one of the problems with the constant global @xmath0 approximation , apart from the fact that observations of the interstellar gas have shown it to be wrong , is that the maximum observed brightness temperature in the lab survey is @xmath16150 k which is greater than our best fit global @xmath0 .",
    "this is solved by clipping the observations when generating the gas annuli , which is not an optimal solution .",
    "a different possibility is to use the assumption @xmath17 here , @xmath18 is the maximum observed brightness temperature for each line of sight .",
    "this ensures @xmath0 is always greater than @xmath4 .",
    "scanning the values of @xmath19 and @xmath20 with a step size of 10 k and 5 k , respectively , gives us a maximum likelihood for @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "while this assumption still does not account for the complexity of the interstellar medium , the log likelihood ratio between the best fit linear relation model and the best fit constant @xmath0 model is of the order of 1000 , a significant change .",
    "the most accurate @xmath0 estimates come from observations of h i in absorption against bright radio sources .",
    "we gathered over 500 lines of sight with observed @xmath0 from the literature @xcite . this covers about 0.2% of the pixels in the lab survey , allowing for accurate column density estimates only in those pixels . after taking our best fit linear relation model and correcting the pixels with known @xmath0 the fit was redone for the whole sky .",
    "note that we did not change the values of @xmath23 and @xmath20 .",
    "the log likelihood ratio of 105 tells us that this model is worse than the best fit linear relation .",
    "this is not unexpected , since the gamma rays are generated from cr interactions with the gas and if the gas distribution is wrong , we wo nt get the correct cr distribution from the fit . to limit the uncertainty involved with the linear relation assumption , we did another fit , limiting ourselves to the region @xmath24 , @xmath25 that covers the observations made in the canadian galactic plane survey ( cgps ) where the density of @xmath0 observations is the highest and is large enough to get a good fit to the lat data .",
    "the fit in this region results in a log likelihood ratio of 28 indicating a statistically significant improvement in the fit .",
    "this is despite the observed @xmath0 lines of sight only covering 25% of the fitted region and the values of @xmath19 and @xmath20 not being adjusted after correcting for known @xmath0 values .",
    "our small exercise here has shown that for accurate dge modeling we need to know more about the distribution of gas in the galaxy , especially the h i distribution .",
    "the standard constant @xmath0 assumption is not sufficient for current instruments and small adjustments cause large differences in the quality of the resulting model .",
    "we also show that direct observations of @xmath0 help in creating a better model of the dge .",
    "unfortunately , direct observations of @xmath0 are difficult since they require high resolution telescopes and bright radio continuum sources .",
    "some assumptions will therefore have to be made for the regions in between bright radio sources .",
    "it must be stated here that all of the above results are model dependent .",
    "the fermi - lat data can only provide us with the intensity of gamma - rays from a particular direction of the sky .",
    "uncertainties in our modeling of contribution other than those directly related to the h i distribution will affect the value obtained for @xmath0 .",
    "we are currently studying the systematic effects this will have on our results .",
    "we also note that even for the best fit models , the residuals show signs of structure , strongly indicating our models are less than perfect ."
