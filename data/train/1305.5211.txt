    "in this paper , we mainly consider the linear system @xmath7 where the matrix @xmath4 is a complex symmetric matrix .",
    "this kind of linear systems ( [ eq:1.1 ] ) arise from different physical applications , for example , in modeling electromagnetic waves under the assumption of time - harmonic variation in the electromagnetic fields , helmholtz s equations with a complex shift ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) etc .",
    "moreover , the complex - valued linear system ( [ eq:1.1 ] ) can be directly generated in the field of lattice quantum chromo dynamics ( qcd ) , where a model of the interactions of fermions ( or quarks ) on a lattice is given in terms of a complex - valued gauge field that directly leads to the linear system ( [ eq:1.1 ] ) ( see , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , this complex symmetric linear system also arises in centered difference discretization of the @xmath8-pad approximations in the time integration of parabolic partial differential equations ( @xcite ) and in direct frequency domain analysis of an @xmath9-degree - of - freedom ( @xmath9-dof ) linear system ( @xcite ) .",
    "there are some examples of scientific applications in @xcite .",
    "therefore , researches on numerical solutions of the linear system ( [ eq:1.1 ] ) are greatly needed .",
    "next , for convenience , let @xmath10 denote the set of @xmath11 complex matrices and @xmath4 be a nonsingular matrix in @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath12 and @xmath13 are the largest and smallest eigenvalues of @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "recently , a _ complex symmetric positive definite _ ( cspd ) matrix arising from the linear system ( [ eq:1.1 ] ) in gaussian elimination without pivoting was firstly studied by higham in @xcite , which is called by _ * higham matrices * _ in @xcite .",
    "subsequently , the paper @xcite gave a broader class of complex matrices_*generalized higham matrices*_(sometimes they are also called accretive - dissipative matrices ( see @xcite ) ) , i.e. , for any @xmath15 , if , its hermitian decomposition ( see , @xcite ) @xmath16 satisfies that @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the conjugate transpose of @xmath1 , then the matrix @xmath4 is said to be a generalized higham matrix and denoted by @xmath19 .",
    "here , the sign @xmath20 is usually called the loewner partial order of hermitian matrices ; i.e. , we write @xmath21 if the matrix @xmath22 is positive semidefinite , similarly , @xmath23 means that @xmath22 is positive definite .",
    "in addition , a related class of matrices defined by @xmath24 will be denoted by @xmath25 as in @xcite .",
    "this paper is a continuation of @xcite , and they both originate from the higham s paper @xcite .    as it is well known , for the complex symmetric linear system ( [ eq:1.1 ] ) , the growth factor @xmath26 in gaussian elimination for @xmath4 is defined by @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 is the matrix obtained through the application of the first @xmath31 steps of gaussian elimination to a ( see , e.g.,@xcite ) . in particular",
    ", @xmath32 is the upper triangular matrix resulting from the @xmath33 factorization of @xmath4 .    obviously , for the matrix @xmath4 in the linear system ( [ eq:1.1 ] ) , if one is able to prove a satisfactory priori bound for @xmath26 , then it is safe not to pivot in computing the @xmath33 factorization of the matrix @xmath4 ( or to choose diagonal pivots based on other considerations such as sparsity preservation ) ( see , @xcite ) .",
    "for any higham matrix @xmath4 , the growth factor in gaussian elimination @xmath34 was firstly conjectured by higham ( see , @xcite , p.210 ) .",
    "an incorrect proof was given in @xcite , but ikramov et al .",
    "@xcite subsequently showed that @xmath35 for any higham matrix @xmath4 .",
    "in addition , if the higham matrix is extended by allowing @xmath1 and @xmath2 to be arbitrary hermitian positive definite matrices , then @xmath36 moreover , ikaramov et al noted that the above bound ( [ eq:1.6 ] ) remains true when @xmath1 or @xmath2 or both are negative ( rather than positive ) definite ( see , @xcite ) .    for a very restricted subset of higham matrices ,",
    "i.e. , when @xmath37 and @xmath2 is real , symmetric and positive definite , the authors in @xcite proved the better bound @xmath38 in addition , a. george and k. d. ikramov ( @xcite ) assumed that @xmath1 and @xmath2 with being positive definite , satisfy the inequality @xmath39 and they established a bound for the growth factor @xmath40 that has the limit @xmath41 as @xmath42 .",
    "recently , lin @xcite proved that if @xmath4 is a generalized higham matrices , then the growth factor for such @xmath4 in gaussian elimination is less than 4 .",
    "specially when @xmath4 is a higham matrix , then the growth factor is less than @xmath43 .",
    "however , as authors in @xcite pointed out , in no case have they observed the growth bigger than higham s guess of @xmath6 from extensive numerical experiments with higham matrices .",
    "therefore , they believed that the bound ( [ eq:1.4 ] ) is correct and took the proof of this bound for an open problem ( see also problem 10.12 in @xcite ) .    in this work , we continue studying this open problem and then give a new result @xmath44 for the generalized higham matrix @xmath4 , where @xmath45 is the maximum of the condition numbers of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "this directly leads to the higham s result ( [ eq:1.4 ] ) for any higham matrix @xmath4 , which proves the open problem . here , for a nonsingular matrix @xmath4",
    ", its condition number is denoted by @xmath46 , i.e. , the ratio of the largest and smallest singular value of @xmath4 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we show some new bounds on the growth factor , based on the condition number . in section 3 ,",
    "some figures and numerical examples are given to illustrate our results .",
    "in this section , let @xmath15 be partitioned as @xmath47 where @xmath4 is an @xmath11 nonsingular matrix .",

    "( @xcite).[lem:2.1 ] let @xmath4 be a cspd matrix , then @xmath4 is nonsingular , and any principal submatrix of @xmath4 and any schur complement in @xmath4 are also cspd matrices .",

    "( @xcite)[lem:2.2 ] .",
    "the largest element of a cspd matrix @xmath4 lies on its main diagonal .",
    "thus , for any cspd matrix @xmath4 , the definition ( [ eq:1.2 ] ) can be replaced by @xmath50 which greatly simplifies the analysis on bounding the growth factor for a cspd matrix @xmath4 .",

    "it is easy to see that @xmath96 can be obtained by performing block gaussian elimination in @xmath92 ; i.e. , @xmath97 setting @xmath98 . since both @xmath93 and @xmath94 are hermitian positive definite , according to the result of the lemma [ lem:3.1 ] , we have @xmath99    next , by the corollary [ cor:3.3 ] and @xmath100 is decreasing in @xmath101 , we get @xmath102 where @xmath103 .",
