    "this description allows us to analyze the superconductor - graphene interface more microscopically as compared to a description where the continuous limit leading to an effective dirac - bogoliubov - de gennes equation is taken from the start @xcite . in the continuous description",
    "it is usually assumed that the presence of the interface do not couple different valleys of the graphene band structure , which could not be the case in an actual experimental situation .",

    "we propose two different models for this interface : the first one assumes that graphene is coupled directly to a bulk superconducting electrode which does not maintain the honeycomb structure of the graphene sheet ; the second model studies the possibility that one superconducting electrode on top of the graphene sheet induces a finite pairing amplitude and shifts the fermi level of the graphene sheet far away from the dirac point . as we discuss below , the two models lead to different behavior of the andreev reflection probability as a function of energy , wave vector and doping level .",

    "for the description of the electronic states in a defect free graphene layer we shall adopt the tight - binding approximation , i.e. we use a model hamiltonian of the type @xmath0 , where @xmath1 denote the hopping element between nearest neighbors carbon atoms on the hexagonal lattice and @xmath2 is a uniform site energy level which allows to vary the level of doping ( @xmath3 corresponds to the undoped case ) .",

    "an essential ingredient for describing the interface between a graphene layer and other material is a good description of the electronic green functions at the edges of the layer .",
    "we concentrate here in the derivation of the edge green function for a semi - infinite graphene layer with armchair orientation .",
    "we assume that there is translational symmetry in the direction parallel to the edge @xmath15 .",
    "the semi - infinite system can be decomposed into lines of sites in the @xmath8 direction which are coupled by hopping elements with the neighboring lines on the @xmath7 direction .",

    "this effect is due to the breaking of the double degeneracy of the bands due to the coupling with the superconductor .",
    "the ldos also exhibits an oscillatory behavior with the position on the layer .",
    "this behavior reflects the properties of the electronic wave functions and , as in the case of isolated nanoribbons @xcite , is distinct for lines with @xmath184 and lines with @xmath185 .",
    "we thus illustrate these cases separately on the top and on the lower panels of fig .",
    "[ ldos - finita ] .",
    "the right panels of fig .",
    "[ ldos - finita ] show the evolution along the layer of the ldos close to the singularities .",
    "we illustrate this evolution at three different energies corresponding to the lowest first singularities , indicated by @xmath186 and 2 in fig .",
    "[ ldos - finita ] . for reference",
    "we also show the spatial variation of the ldos close to the first singularity for the uncoupled case . in this case",
    "the ldos reaches a maximum value at the edges of the layer and a minimum in the middle for lines @xmath171 , while the opposite behavior is found for @xmath172 . in the coupled case",
    "one can still identify the singularities with the oscillation pattern in the ldos but it does no longer reach an extreme value at the edge of the layer in contact with the superconductor .    as final remark",
    "we note that in the case of insulating nanoribbons the coupling to the superconductor just induces a shift singularities in the spectrum but do not change their number .",
    "this is due to the nondegenerate character of the bands of the uncoupled layer .",
    "the results of the previous section can be extended to analyze the spectral properties of a semi - infinite graphene layer coupled to a superconductor .",
    "the local green function on a line @xmath138 is given by    @xmath187^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath188 is the green function for a finite graphene layer coupled to a semi - infinite superconducting layer obtained in the previous section and @xmath189 is the green function for the edge of the semi - infinite layer .",
    "for a semi - infinite graphene layer coupled to a superconductor within the bulk - bcs model ( lower panels ) .",
    "the upper panels show the corresponding results for the uncoupled case .",
    "the plots on the left correspond to the undoped case while those on the right correspond to @xmath190 . ]    fig . [ dos - semiinfinite ] illustrates the spatial variation of the ldos on a semi - infinite graphene layer and the effect of varying the doping level within the bulk - bcs model . for reference",
    "we show the ldos for the uncoupled case on the upper panels . as can be observed , the uncoupled ldos exhibits long wavelength oscillations on the @xmath191 scale on top of the characteristic v shape behavior .",
    "these oscillations are a surface effect which decreases in amplitude inside the layer as shown in fig .",
    "[ ldos - oscillations ] , where the ldos profile at @xmath192 is plotted on a larger scale .",
    "a similar effect has been shown to occur in the case of nanoribbons with zigzag edges @xcite .",
    "the superconducting proximity effect is manifested by the appearance of sharp peaks in the ldos for energies @xmath193 ( lower panels on fig .",
    "[ dos - semiinfinite ] ) .",
    "these peaks distort the v shape density of states , an effect which decays within a few times the coherence length inside the layer .",
    "the small oscillations on the @xmath194 scale are reduced as compared to the uncoupled case but are still observable within the bulk - bcs model ( indicated by the full line in fig .",
    "[ ldos - oscillations ] ) .",
    "the overall behavior of the ldos within the hdsc model is very similar , although in this last case the @xmath194 oscillations are further suppressed ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ ldos - oscillations ] ) .",
    "the right panels in fig .",
    "[ dos - semiinfinite ] illustrate the effect on the ldos of a displacement from the charge neutrality condition by applying a gate potential ( finite @xmath2 ) .",
    "it is observed that the v shape is essentially rigidly displaced while the peaks induced by the proximity effect remain fixed at @xmath195 . on the other hand ,",
    "the wavelength of the oscillation pattern is in this case set by @xmath196 .    .",
    "we have presented a theoretical analysis of the proximity effect at a graphene - superconductor interface . for this study",
    "we have first derived analytical expressions for the green functions on an armchair edge of a semi - infinite graphene layer and for a finite layer .    two models for describing microscopically the coupling to a superconductor have been presented . in the first model a bulk superconducting electrode",
    "is connected directly to the armchair edge of a graphene sheet ( bulk - bcs model ) .",
    "the honeycomb structure of graphene is broken and this is reflected in the different behavior of the andreev reflection probability on the two eigenchannels of the graphene sheet as a function of the parallel momentum @xmath6 . only for the case of zero doping",
    "both eigenchannels are equivalent . within this model",
    "one can study the effect of varying the normal transparency of the interface ( through parameter @xmath98 ) .",
    "the andreev reflection probability at normal incidence never reaches unity within this model but has a maximum value of @xmath116 . in the second model",
    "it is assumed that the superconducting electrode induces a finite order parameter on the graphene regions underneath .",
    "this model thus maintains the graphene sublattice structure and , as we have shown , the andreev reflection amplitude @xmath197 is a scalar quantity for arbitrary doping and always reaches the unitary limit for normal incidence .",
    "we have also studied the effect of the coupling to the superconductor on the spectral properties of finite and semi - infinite graphene layers . for finite layers",
    "we have obtained a simple expression for the energy spectrum of the coupled system which can be easily evaluated numerically .",
    "we have shown that a metallic ribbon develops a minigap whose size decreases inversely with the length of the layer .",
    "this effect can be associated with the pseudo - diffusive behavior of graphene .",
    "the induced minigap is slightly smaller in the bulk - bcs model with @xmath115 than in the hdsc model .    for the semi - infinite case the proximity effect manifests in the appearance of peaks in the density of states for frequencies @xmath193 .",
    "these peaks decay rapidly inside the graphene sheet for distances a few times the superconducting coherence length @xmath198 . on the other hand ,",
    "the ldos keeps its characteristic v shape for zero doping for frequencies @xmath199 .",
    "we expect that these findings can be useful to analyze future stm experiments on graphene sheets with superconducting electrodes .",
