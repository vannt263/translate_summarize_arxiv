    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is the leading candidate for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) , because it provides a weak scale solution to the gauge hierarchy problem as well as a dynamical mechanism for the electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "usual treatments of susy , however , do not address the problem of flavors .",
    "the flavor problem consists of the existence of fermion generations , their mass and mixing hierarchies , as well as the existence of cp violation in quark ( and now also in neutrino ) mixings , and probably has origins above the weak scale . in an interesting combination  @xcite of abelian flavor symmetry ( afs ) and susy ,",
    "it was pointed out  @xcite that a generic feature is the near - maximal @xmath1@xmath2 squark mixing .",
    "such a near - maximal mixing allows for one state to be considerably lighter than the squark mass scale @xmath3 .",
    "such a state , called the strange - beauty squark @xmath4 , carries both @xmath5 and @xmath6 flavors , and is bound to impact on @xmath7 transitions .",
    "it is remarkable that we may have a hint for new physics in cp violation in @xmath8 decay , which is a @xmath9 transition .",
    "the sm predicts that the mixing - dependent cp violation in this mode , measured in analogous way as the well established cp violation in @xmath10 mode , should yield the same result .",
    "the belle collaboration , however , has found an opposite sign in the @xmath8 mode for two consecutive years  @xcite .",
    "the current discrepancy with sm prediction stands at a 3.5@xmath11 level .",
    "the result from the babar collaboration in 2003 is at odds  @xcite with belle , but the combined result is still in 2.7@xmath11 disagreement with sm expectation .",
    "while more data are needed to clarify the situation , it has been pointed out  @xcite that a light @xmath4 squark provides all the necessary ingredients to narrow this large discrepancy with sm prediction .",
    "it has ( 1 ) a large @xmath5@xmath6 flavor mixing , ( 2 ) a ( unique ) new cp violating phase , and ( 3 ) right - handed dynamics .",
    "the latter is needed for explaining why similar  wrong - sign \" effects are not observed in the modes such as @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "these modes yield consistent results as what was measured in @xmath10 .",
    "a detailed study of various @xmath14 decays suggested  @xcite that @xmath15 gev and @xmath16 gev are needed , while the squark mass scale @xmath3 and other susy particles can be well above the tev scale .",
    "it is clear that a squark as light as 200 gev is of great interest since the tevatron has a chance of seeing it .",
    "one should independently pursue the search for a relatively light @xmath4 squark , even if the @xmath8 cp violation discrepancy evaporates in the next few years .",
    "we note that a strange - beauty squark , carrying @xmath17 50% in strange and beauty flavor , would lead to a weakening of bounds on beauty squark search based on @xmath6-tagging . in this work ,",
    "we study direct strange - beauty squark - pair production , as well as the feed down from gluino - pair production and the associated production of @xmath4 with a gluino .",

    "however , for squark mass above 300 gev , the feed down from gluino - pair production with @xmath18 gev becomes important .",
    "we also study various decay scenarios of the strange - beauty squarks at the tevatron , which is of immediate interest .",

    "we have studied three decay scenarios of the strange - beauty squarks that are relevant for the search at the tevatron , which is of immediate interest because it can be readily done in the near future .",
    "the three decay modes that we have considered are ( i ) ( quasi-)stable @xmath4 as in @xmath4-lsp susy or in gauge - mediated susy breaking with a very large @xmath155 , ( ii ) @xmath20-parity violating decay of @xmath4 ( hence @xmath4 behaves like a leptoquark ) , and ( iii ) the popular case of @xmath156 decay , where @xmath157 is the lsp . in the first case",
    ", the @xmath4 once produced would hadronize into a massive stable charged particle like a  heavy muon \" , which would ionize and form a track in the central tracking system and in the outer muon chamber .",
    "this is a very clean signature .",
    "the sensitivity for run ii with an integrated luminosity of 2 fb@xmath145 is up to about 300 gev , which may increase to about 350 gev with an order more luminosity . in the second case",
    ", the @xmath4 decays like a leptoquark of the first or second generation .",
    "the best current limit is 260 gev ( preliminary @xcite ) for the first generation .",
    "this is already at the sensitivity level of the tev2000 study @xcite for 2 fb@xmath145 . with an order more luminosity",
    ", the limit should reach 350 gev . in the last case ,",
    "@xmath156 decay leads to multiple @xmath6-jets plus large missing energy in the final state .",
    "the number of @xmath6-tag events depends on the mixing angle @xmath94 , because the branching ratio of @xmath158 scales as @xmath150 . as long as @xmath159",
    ", the sensitivity at the run ii with 2 fb@xmath145 goes up to about 300 gev . with",
    "improved @xmath6-tagging in run ii , one can also make use of the single versus double @xmath6-tag ratio as well as the @xmath6-tagged cross section to determine @xmath113 and the mixing angle @xmath150 .    at the lhc @xmath160 and",
    "@xmath161 pair production cross sections are comparable , with @xmath40 fusion being the dominant mechanism .",
    "unlike at the tevatron , the associated production of @xmath162 becomes interesting at the lhc .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath163 or @xmath164 pair production remains relatively unimportant . with @xmath4 as light as 200 gev , @xmath160 pair production may be relatively forward",
    ". on the other hand , @xmath165 events , followed by @xmath166 , would have extra hard jets to provide more handles .",
    "the @xmath167 final state , if it can be separated , can probe the mixing angle @xmath168 in the production cross section .",
    "discovery of the strange - beauty squark at the lhc should be no problem at all , but the richness demands a more dedicated study , which we leave for future work .    in conclusion ,",
    "the recent possible cp violation discrepancy in @xmath8 decay suggests the possibility of a light strange - beauty squark @xmath4 that carries both strange and beauty flavors .",
    "such an unusual squark can be searched for at the tevatron run ii , with the precaution that @xmath4 can decay into a beauty or strange quark , and the standard @xmath151 search should be broadened .",
    "discovery up to 300 gev is not a problem , and anomalous behavior in both production cross sections and the single versus double tag ratio may provide confirming evidence for the strange - beauty squark .",
