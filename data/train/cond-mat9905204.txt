    "hysteresis is the history dependence of the properties of a material when driven by an applied external field @xcite .",
    "it is observed in many different systems in non - equilibrium conditions . in general",
    "it is a dynamical effect which must be treated within a time - dependent formalism . here",
    "we will focus on a special class of systems that display , under certain conditions , time independent hysteresis properties .",
    "the prototypes are ferromagnets , at low temperature , in which magnetization versus magnetic field paths are not influenced by the applied field rate , at least for low enough rates . in such materials ,",
    "when these paths are studied in detail , it is commonly observed that they are not continuous but rather composed of small bursts or avalanches : this is the so - called barkhausen noise @xcite .",
    "this abrupt and stochastic response of the magnetization to a continuously varying external field has been related to the disorder existing in the system @xcite .",
    "actually , domain walls are pinned by impurities and therefore a magnetization change can only occur if the corresponding energetic barriers are overcome ( depinning ) . since these barriers are large , thermal activation is not effective , and the evolution of the sytem can only proceed by modifying the external field ( athermal behavior ) . in addition to ferromagnetic materials , a wide variety of complex systems like martensitic materials@xcite , superconducting films@xcite , or capillary condensation systems@xcite , display similar phenomenology .",
    "all these systems can be described in the framework of fluctuationless first - order ( flfo ) phase transitions , i.e. they exhibit , when driven by an external field , a first - order phase transition influenced by disorder with irrelevant thermal fluctuations .",
    "recently , different versions of spin lattice models with disorder , as the random bond @xcite and random field ising models @xcite , have been used to model hysteresis and avalanches in systems undergoing flfo phase transitions .",
    "deterministic algorithms with synchronous dynamics corresponding to local energy relaxation have been employed to study hysteresis paths at zero temperature .",
    "it has been found that the shape of hysteresis loops depends on the amount of disorder @xcite . for low disorder ,",
    "when sweeping the field from -@xmath1 to + @xmath2 , the system reverses sharply the magnetization ( infinite avalanche ) at a given field , while for a high amount of disorder the path is smoother and extends over a wide range of fields .",
    "interestingly the change in the hysteresis cycle shape has been attributed to the existence of a critical point at a given degree of disorder , where the infinite avalanche disappears .",
    "for such a degree of disorder , avalanches of all sizes are detected indicating that the system behaves critically : the avalanche size distribution follows a power law characterized by a universal exponent depending only on the space dimensionality @xcite .",
    "actually , in agreement with the models , it has been experimentally observed that the amplitude of barkhausen pulses in ferromagnetic materials , and the amplitude of the acoustic signals generated during martensitic transitions , extend over several decades indicating the possibility of a universal critical behavior @xcite .",
    "a number of attempts to make a comparison between models and experiments have been reported .",
    "@xcite nevertheless , the existence of criticality induced by changing the amount of disorder has not been confirmed .",
    "the difficulty arises from the possibility of controlling the amount of disorder in a given system . in any case",
    ", it must be mentioned that the studied models appear as very simple idealizations when compared to the complexity inherent to real systems .",
    "this paper is concerned with the study of the magnetic properties of the cu - al - mn intermetallic alloy . after a suitable heat treatment @xcite",
    ", this material displays an l2@xmath3 structure .",
    "the stoichiometric compound cu@xmath4almn is ferromagnetic with a curie temperature of 630 k and it is known that the entire magnetic moment of the system must be attributed to the mn atoms @xcite coupled via the rkky interaction @xcite .",
    "ac susceptibility measurements have revealed the existence of a spin - freezing process at low temperatures .",
    "this freezing has been shown to correspond to a spin glass phase transition for low enough mn content @xcite . beyond this problem , here we focus on the study of the low temperature magnetic hysteresis for such systems .",
    "we have studied a family of composition related alloys which undergo , prior to the spin - freezing process , a diffusionless structural transition to a close - packed phase ( martensitic transition ) . in these materials , magnetic disorder has two main origins : the lack of stoichiometry and the existence of incomplete configurational ordering @xcite .",
    "the important fact is that the mn configurational disorder increases as the mn content decreases .",
    "we show that increasing the degree of disorder , the low temperature hysteresis cycle changes from sharp to smooth .",
    "this change is suggested to be related to a disorder induced phase transition . since the experimental evidences are not definitively conclusive",
    ", we reinforce our interpretation by developing a microscopic model for such site - diluted magnetic systems . by fitting the model parameters to cu - al - mn available data",
    ", we reproduce approximately the observed phenomenon and associate it with the disorder induced phase transition .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present the experimental results ; in section iii we introduce a model based on a site diluted ising model suitable for the study of hysteresis in spin glass systems and compare the results obtained numerically with the experimental ones corresponding to cu - al - mn . finally , in section iv we discuss the results and conclude .",
    "we have studied a family of alloys , with compositions close to the cu@xmath5almn@xmath6 line .",
    "polycrystalline ( grain size @xmath7 100 @xmath8 m ) cylindrical - shaped ingots were obtained by melting pure elements @xmath9 .",
    "rectangular shaped samples ( @xmath10 mm@xmath11 ) were cut using a low - speed diamond saw .",
    "the samples were mechanically polished down to a thickness of @xmath12 mm .",
    "samples were annealed for @xmath13 s at @xmath14 k , quenched into a mixture of ice and water , and annealed at room temperature for several weeks .",
    "this heat treatment leads to a long - lived metastable state in which the material displays an l2@xmath3 structure ( @xmath15 space group ) .",
    "this structure can be viewed as defined on a bcc lattice divided in four distinguishible fcc sublattices ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) as shown in figure [ fig1 ] . for samples with @xmath20 ( as in the present work ) , sublattices @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( for instance ) are filled with cu - atoms , and mn - atoms sit preferentially in sublattice @xmath16 . however , for kinetic reasons , a fraction of mn atoms also occupies the @xmath17 sublattice .",
    "experiments based on atom location by channelling enhanced microanalysis ( alchemi ) performed on similar samples have shown that almost no mn atoms occupy sublattices @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "@xcite    the spin - freezing temperatures @xmath21 of the alloys studied have been obtained from ac - susceptibility measurements @xcite . as shown in table [ samples ] , in all the samples studied @xmath21 is below the martensitic transition .",
    "we also present the values of the paramagnetic curie temperature @xmath22 and the temperature @xmath23 of the structural transition taken from the same ref . .",
    "concerning @xmath22 , note that it is positive for the three samples , which indicates the mean ferromagnetic character of the interactions .",
    "magnetization measurements have been carried out , at low field rates ( @xmath24 oe / s ) using a squid magnetometer enabling applied fields up to 5 t ( the relative error in the field control is @xmath25 % ) .",
    "the hysteresis observed in the glassy phase reflects the non - equilibrium state of the system characterized by a logarithmically slow response of the magnetization to an applied field .",
    "limiting hysteresis loops have been measured after a zero - field cooling ( zfc ) and subsequent ( isothermal ) field sweep between @xmath26 t and @xmath27 t at different temperatures ( controlled within @xmath28 k ) . in figure [ fig2 ]",
    "we show the hysteresis cycles obtained at @xmath29 k in the three samples studied .",
    "loops are symmetrical and display small coercivity and remanence .",
    "it is worth mentioning that for the sample with @xmath30 ( @xmath31 mn ) , the hysteresis loop has also been measured after a field cooling ( fc ) .",
    "the cycle obtained is identical from the one measured after a zfc .",
    "this proves the absence of global uniaxial exchange anisotropy in the polycrystalline samples considered .    from the results given in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] it is clear that the magnetization can be supposed to be composed of an irreversible and a reversible contributions:@xcite    @xmath32    only the irreversible term contributes to hysteresis . actually , the reversible contribution must be ascribed to the competition of the external field with minoritary antiferromagnetic bonds in the system , and can be assumed to be linear with the magnetic field :    @xmath33    from linear fitting , we have determined @xmath34 for the alloys investigated .",
    "the values obtained are : @xmath35 emu/(molmn oe ) , @xmath36 emu/(molmn oe ) and @xmath37 emu/(molmn oe ) for the samples with @xmath38 ( @xmath39 mn ) , @xmath30 ( @xmath40 mn ) and @xmath41 ( @xmath42 mn ) respectively .",
    "therefore , within errors , @xmath34 can be assumed independent of @xmath43 , at least in the range of compositions studied .",
    "after subtraction of the reversible term in the magnetization measured , we have estimated a saturation magnetization @xmath44 . it is represented ( per mn atom ) as a function of @xmath43 in fig .",
    "we obtain that @xmath44 increases linearly with @xmath43 . the value of @xmath44 corresponding to the stoichiometric cu@xmath4almn alloy ( @xmath45 ) has been taken from the literature @xcite .    as temperature",
    "is increased the width of the cycle ( coercivity ) decreases and , as expected , we have not observed hysteresis above @xmath46 . in figure [ fig4 ]",
    "we show the effect of temperature on hysteresis by plotting the central part of the hysteresis loops at three different temperatures . in all cases",
    "the cycles are smooth and no discontinuities ( or avalanches ) have been detected .",
    "however the cycle corresponding to @xmath41 obtained at @xmath47 k , shows practically a complete reversal of the remanent magnetization in a very reduced interval of fields .",
    "this changes the shape of the hysteresis loop which becomes sharper in its central part .    in order to quantitatively",
    "characterize the shape of the hysteresis loops , we have represented in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] the remanence @xmath48 , the coercivity @xmath49 and the area of the loops @xmath50 , as a function of temperature for the three different compositions studied .",
    "the area of the loops , which gives the dissipated energy per cycle , decreases with @xmath51 and increases with the mn content @xmath43 .",
    "notice also that for the sample with @xmath41 the coercive field does not change for @xmath52 k. this fact is associated with the change in the shape of the hysteresis loop outlined in the previous paragraph .",
    "we argue that the observed change in the hysteresis loop can be related to the fact that , as has recently been shown @xcite , a spin - glass phase transition occurs for samples with @xmath53 , but not for samples with higher mn concentration . for these compositions",
    ", the cusp in the magnetic susceptibility curve as a function of temperature is related to the freezing of ferromagnetic clusters , being the high - temperature phase superparamgnetic and the low - temperature phase what we will call in this article a ferromagnetic spin - glass @xcite .",
    "therefore we suggest that the change in the hysteresis loop may be related to a phase transition which has the origin on the different ground state properties of the system as @xmath43 is increased .",
    "actually the value of @xmath43 at the transition point , should be close to the percolation limit for the system studied .",
    "it would be expected that remanent magnetization reverses at a single value of the field ( large avalanche ) .",
    "the fact that this does not strictly occur is due , as we will discuss in the next section , to the polycrystalline character of the samples studied .",
    "we have also studied first - order reversal cycles within the limiting loop obtained as follows : starting from @xmath54 t the external field is increased to a value @xmath55 ( @xmath56 t ) , before saturation . at this point",
    "the field evolution is reversed back to @xmath54 t. for different @xmath55 one obtains a family of trajectories , some of which are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig51 ] for the sample with @xmath30 and @xmath47 k. it is worth noting that in all cases the decreasing reversal trajectories join tangentially the limiting cycle .",
    "the shape of these reversal trajectories depends on @xmath55 . in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig51 ] we show the coercive field of the reversal trajectories @xmath57 as a function of @xmath55 . note that for the sample with @xmath41 ( circles ) , @xmath57 remains approximately constant with @xmath55 when aproaching @xmath49 from above .",
    "this is indicative of the fact that the reversal of magnetization occurs at a fixed field for high @xmath43 .",
    "an interesting feature observed in a number of systems exhibiting flfo phase transitions is the return point memory effect .",
    "this property is well illustrated by analysing the characteristics of complete internal hysteresis loops .",
    "these internal loops are obtained when , coming from @xmath54 t and being in a state corresponding to a field @xmath58 t on the limiting cycle , the field evolution is reversed back until reaching @xmath59 , and later is increased up again to @xmath60 .",
    "the return point memory effect is verified if , after this path , the system returns exactly to the same state that was left in the limiting cycle , that is , if it has memory of the former state . in this case , the same memory effect extends to any subcycle within a given cycle , and therefore this indicates that the state of the system can remember an entire hierarchy of turning points in its past evolution .",
    "this phenomenon has been observed in some , but by no means all , systems with flfo phase transitions .",
    "we have performed such complete internal cycles by reversing the field at different states in the limiting cycle .",
    "typical results are shown in fig .",
    "it is observed that after performing an internal loop and returning to the former field , the magnetization has increased . by performing internal cycles at different sweeping field rates ( in the positive and negative applied field regions ) ,",
    "we have checked that this increase of the magnetization is significantly larger than the increase expected from logarithmic relaxational effects .",
    "this enables to conclude that , in our system , the return point memory property is not satisfied .",
    "in order to gain understanding of the observed experimental phenomena we develop , in this section , a model containing two basic ingredients : randomness of the lattice position of the magnetic atoms and competing interactions .",
    "these two ingredients are crucial for the existence of spin - glass phenomena @xcite .",
    "the proposed model is a modified version of the diluted ising model at @xmath61.@xcite    we only consider sublattices @xmath16 and @xmath17 as possible sites for mn atoms ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "therefore we define a simple cubic lattice @xcite with @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) sites and with periodic boundary conditions and lattice spacing @xmath64 . on each site",
    "we define a variable @xmath65 which indicates the presence ( 1 ) or absence ( 0 ) of mn on that site , and an ising variable @xmath66 which accounts for two possible magnetic states of mn atoms .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model is written as :    @xmath67    where the first term is a sum over site pairs , @xmath68 is the exchange energy , @xmath69 the external field and @xmath8 the effective magnetic moment per atom .",
    "a number @xmath70 of mn atoms are randomly placed as follows : a fraction @xmath71 is placed in sublattice @xmath16 while the rest @xmath72 is `` misplaced '' in sublattice @xmath17 .",
    "values of @xmath73 ranging from @xmath74 to @xmath75 have been considered .",
    "the concentration of mn is given by @xmath76 .",
    "the exchange constants @xmath68 are distance dependent .",
    "for the stoichiometric alloy , @xmath68 have been fitted from inelastic neutron scattering experiments @xcite .",
    "the fitted values are the ones corresponding to neighbors of 2nd , 4th , 6th and 7th order in table [ jij ] .",
    "we assume that @xmath68 do not change significantly when altering the mn content",
    ". nevertheless we still have to interpolate the values of the @xmath68 corresponding to distances which are not present in perfectly ordered stoichiometric alloys . to do that we have fitted a standard rkky dependence to the experimental @xmath68 :    @xmath77    where @xmath78 is proportional to the fermi moment @xmath79 .",
    "since it is difficult to fit such an oscillating function we have first checked different values of @xmath78 in order to get the correct signs of the @xmath68 found experimentally .",
    "the signs are only correctly fitted for values of @xmath78 around @xmath80 .",
    "@xcite a standard least square fitting , then , renders @xmath81 mev . using this fit",
    "we then interpolate the values of @xmath68 for the neighbors of order @xmath82st , @xmath83rd and @xmath29th indicated in table [ jij ] with asterisks .    a strong antiferromagnetic interaction between n.n . sites",
    "( that can only occur due to misplaced mn atoms ) is obtained .",
    "this is consistent with the antiferromagnetic character found in @xmath18-mn with fcc structure @xcite ( lattice parameter @xmath84 ) .",
    "nevertheless we have checked that the mean character of the interactions ( which can be estimated as a sum @xmath85 over all mn pairs @xmath86 ) is always ferromagnetic for all values of @xmath43 and @xmath73 .",
    "this is consistent with the positive paramagnetic curie temperatures obtained experimentally ( see table [ samples ] ) .    for the simulations we consider the exchange energy for next - nearest neighbors @xmath87 mev as the energy unit .",
    "we define a reduced hamiltonian as :    @xmath88    where @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "we define the reduced magnetization as :    @xmath91    with this definition , the maximum reduced magnetization for the stoichiometric alloy is @xmath92 .",
    "hysteresis cycles ( @xmath93 ) are obtained by starting with all the spin variables @xmath94 and the external field @xmath95 .",
    "the field is then slowly increased until a spin becomes locally unstable , i.e. there is a decrease of energy if it is flipped .",
    "then the external field is stopped , the spin is flipped and an avalanche starts : more spins may become unstable .",
    "these are simulatenously flipped , which may trigger some new unstable spins , and so on until the avalanche stops . the number of steps necessary to reach this stable situation defines the avalanche duration and the corresponding magnetization change the avalanche size .",
    "then the external field is increased again .",
    "this is the so - called synchronous dynamics .",
    "@xcite      we have studied lattices with @xmath96 and for many runs , averages over @xmath97 different initial random atomic configurations have been taken .",
    "we have systematically studied systems with concentration @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath75 and disorder values @xmath101 .",
    "examples of the hysteresis cycles are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] . for a fixed value of @xmath73 ,",
    "the hysteresis loop becomes sharper as @xmath43 is increased , while for a fixed value of @xmath43 the loop becomes smoother when increasing @xmath73 .",
    "note also that for high values of @xmath73 and @xmath43 the loops become antiferromagnetic - like with long tails and with a tendency to split into two subloops . in all cases , when looking in detail at the loops , they consist of a sequence of discrete jumps ( avalanches ) that join metastable states .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] . due to the existence of antiferromagnetic interactions , inverse avalanches , decreasing the magnetization when increasing the field , may occur . concerning this point",
    ", one should remember that the evolution is controlled by a local ( and not global ) equilibrium condition .    in order to study in more detail the evolution from smooth to sharp hysteresis cycles",
    "we have studied the statistical distribution of avalanche sizes .",
    "sharp loops will exhibit few large avalanches while smooth loops will exhibit small avalanches only .",
    "the avalanche distributions have been computed by averaging over 50 different realizations of the random distribution of mn atoms .",
    "the resulting histograms are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] for different values of p and x. we find that , in this p - x diagram , a critical line exists at which avalanches of all sizes are observed and the distributions are power - law .",
    "this behavior has been analyzed following the techniques developed for the study of avalanches in a previous work on the study of flfo phase transitions in the random bond ising model @xcite .",
    "the critical line can be found by studying two quantities : ( i ) the normalized average size @xmath102 of the largest avalanche in a cycle and ( ii ) the average duration @xmath103 of the largest avalanche in a cycle . as an example",
    "we show the behavior of these two quantities along a line with @xmath104 and changing the concentration @xmath43 ( fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ) and along a line with @xmath105 and changing the disorder parameter @xmath73 ( fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] ) .",
    "the phase transition is smoothed due to finite size effects , which can be corrected as explained in ref .. actually , estimations of the transition points can be obtained by locating , using a polinomial fitting , the maximum on @xmath106 and the inflection point on @xmath107 . a systematic study of the behavior of these two quantities as a function of @xmath43 and @xmath73 allows to obtain the phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] .",
    "the discrepancy between the two estimations of the critical line can be attributed to finite - size - effects .",
    "we find critical behaviour , depending on @xmath73 , for @xmath108 .",
    "it is difficult to locate on this @xmath109 diagram the position where this phase transition will be expected to occur in the cu - al - mn system , since the value of @xmath73 for our samples is unknown .",
    "actually we can only have some rough estimations of the @xmath110 dependence in the samples studied .",
    "first , it is possible to obtain @xmath73 from monte carlo simulations of the atomic ordering process in a realistic lattice model for cu - al - mn presented in ref . .",
    "the model considered in that paper contains only interactions to first and second nearest neighbors and its parameters have been fitted from the order - disorder transition temperatures in the real experimental system . the behavior of @xmath73 as a function of @xmath43 obtained from that model is represented by the two dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] .",
    "the lower line corresponds to the values of @xmath73 at @xmath61 , and the upper represents the values of @xmath73 at temperatures just below the order - disorder transition .",
    "according to this result , the actual values of @xmath73 would be somewhere in the middle of these two dotted lines .",
    "the intersection of these lines with the phase transition ( open symbols ) would give the critical concentration where the change in the hysteresis cycle is expected .",
    "however , these estimations of @xmath110 correspond to equilibrium configurations , but kinetic effects ( samples have been quenched from high @xmath51 ) could modify the amount of disorder substantially .",
    "moreover , the model used for the mc simulations does not contain any magnetic interaction term , which could have some relevance in the mn ordering process .",
    "a second estimation can be obtained from the linear behavior of the saturation magnetization per atom @xmath44 with @xmath43 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . note that the system contains two kinds of mn atoms : the minoritary misplaced ones ( in sublattice @xmath17 ) that exhibit antiferromagnetic interaction with its nearest neighbours and the majoritary ones ( in sublattice @xmath16 ) with ferromagnetic interaction with its second neighbours",
    "therefore , when reaching the remanence point by decreasing the applied field from saturation , the misplaced mn atoms will present inverted magnetic moment .",
    "thus , a naive approximation is @xmath111 , where @xmath8 is the magnetic moment per atom and @xmath112 is the saturation magnetization per atom corresponding to a sample with mn atoms completely disordered over the @xmath16 and @xmath17 sublattices ( @xmath113 ) .",
    "note that @xmath114 is symmetric arround @xmath115 as can be expected . the above equation combined with the linear behaviour @xmath116 presented in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , leads to a parabolic dependence @xmath117 .",
    "@xcite although the value of @xmath78 is unknown , it should be very small .",
    "at least smaller than the value @xmath118 found for our sample with @xmath119 .",
    "we can , therefore , sketch this behaviour on the @xmath109 diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] .",
    "the intersection of the two parabolas ( corresponding to @xmath120 and @xmath121 ) with the transition line found from our model gives a different estimation of the transition point .",
    "taking into account the above arguments , from fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] it seems reasonable to assume that the transition is located at @xmath122 .",
    "although this value is slightly above the experimental estimation @xmath123 , the values are still close enough to suggest that , given the similarity of the effects observed in the experimental and simulated hysteresis cycles , the phenomenon may be an example of the kind of phase transition found in the model .    from the model developed in the present work , we can also study the internal hysteresis loops in order to compare with the behavior found experimentally .",
    "[ fig13 ] shows , as an example , an internal loop for a system with @xmath30 and @xmath124 . the qualitative agreement with the experimental case is extremely good , and in both cases an increase of the magnetization is found after the internal loop .",
    "this shows that the rpm property does not hold .",
    "actually , two conditions must be satisfied for the rpm property to be fullfilled .",
    "the first one is the adiabatic character of the system evolution and the second one is the so - called no - passing rule ( preservation of partial ordering of metastable states by the dynamics ) @xcite .",
    "the former condition is satisfied in our simulations ( synchronous dynamics ) and approximately in the experiments ( slow driving rate ) .",
    "nevertheless , the existence of antiferromagnetic interactions producing inverse avalanches ( see fig . [ fig8 ] ) destroys the second condition .",
    "the model developed above describes the behavior of a single crystal with an easy axis of magnetization ( eam ) that corresponds to the direction of the external field . in a polycrystalline sample",
    "the situation is quite different : grains present different crystallographic orientations with respect to the applied field .",
    "the corresponding angular distribution of eam results on two main effects on the hysteresis cycles : ( i ) the cycles become smoother ( hence the avalanches are much more difficult to detect ) and ( ii ) the hysteresis cycle changes its shape .",
    "we can estimate this change in the case of uniaxial anisotropy .",
    "let @xmath125 be the cycle corresponding to a single crystal oriented with the eam along the external field @xmath126 , and let @xmath93 the cycle corresponding to the polycrystal .",
    "assuming that there is a uniform angular distribution of eam in the polycrystal , we will have :    @xmath127    where @xmath128 is the differential solid angle .",
    "this integral has to be performed over all the possible directions of the eam in the sample .",
    "this is not straightforward and requires the knowledge of the direction of the eam . for a cu - al - mn",
    "single crystal it is not known .",
    "nevertheless we can obtain an approximate solution to eq .",
    "[ anis ] as :    @xmath129    where the factor @xmath130 is the differential of solid angle and @xmath131 is the maximum angle between the field and the eam .",
    "for instance we have @xmath132 for a @xmath133 and @xmath134 eam , and @xmath135 for a @xmath136 eam .",
    "in the extreme case of a monoclinic symmetry ( a single eam ) one will have @xmath137 .",
    "figure [ fig14 ] shows the results of this correction on a given hysteresis cycle .",
    "as expected the jump at the phase transition becomes broadened and extends in a certain range of fields .",
    "in section ii we have presented low - temperature measurements of the hysteresis cycles of cu - al - mn in three samples of different mn content .",
    "we have shown that for temperature @xmath138k and mn content @xmath139 the loops exhibit a sharp reversal of magnetization in their central part .",
    "we have proposed that this change is related to the existence of a phase transition from a spin - glass phase to a ferromagnetic spin - glass phase .    in order to gain insight into this phase transition",
    "we have proposed ( in section iii ) a model for the study of the magnetic properties of this system , including the basic physical ingredients of the problem .",
    "the model is based on a @xmath61 diluted ising model with exchange interactions that have been fitted to the experimental values corresponding to stoichiometric cu@xmath140almn .",
    "the model reproduces the existence of magnetic disorder arising from the non - stoichiometry and the misplaced mn atoms , as found experimentally .",
    "it should be remarked that we have not studied the exact equilibrium ground state of the model .",
    "rather we have focused on the hysteresis loops that are obtained by using a synchronous dynamics evolution that drives the system through a sequence of metastable states .      1 .   the change from smooth to sharp cycles by changing the mn content . in the simulations this change corresponds to a phase transition , of the same kind as the one reported in the random field @xcite and random bond ising models @xcite , and it is found at @xmath141 , which is close to the experimental estimation @xmath142 2 .   the existence of long tails for large fields .",
    "the experimental cycles are not saturated even at fields of @xmath29 t. from the model , we have deduced that these tails arise ( i ) from the existence of minoritary antiferromagnetic interactions and ( ii ) as a consequence of the polycrystalline character of the samples used in the experiments .",
    "the magnetic moments subjected to an effective antiferromagnetic interaction are very diluted and do not exhibit any cooperative behavior .",
    "consequently they show a reversible response to the external field . from the model ,",
    "it is reasonable to suppose that these magnetic moments are associated to misplaced mn atoms having other mn atoms as nearest neighbors .",
    "concerning the polycrystallinity of the samples , its main effect is the broadening of the hysteresis due to the averaging over all possible crystallographic orientations of the grains with respect to the external field .",
    "the fact that the rpm effect is not satisfied has been found both experimentally and in the simulations .",
    "the reason is the existence of inverse avalanches associated with the presence of antiferromagnetic interactions . in these avalanches",
    "@xmath143 is negative , contrary to the stability conditions deduced from equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "the possibility of such a result is due to the fact that the process considered is not an equilibrium one ( even if it is very close to a quasiestatic process ) .",
    "in fact the system evolves through a series of metastable states separated by large energy barriers . in the simulations metastability",
    "arises from the fact that relaxation is performed according to the local effective field acting on each magnetic moment .",
    "an important question to be answered is why avalanches are not observed in the experiments .",
    "it is clear that polycrystallinity limits the maximum size of the avalanches to that of a grain . given that the typical size of the grains is of the order of 100 @xmath8 m , and the volume of the sample is @xmath7 3 mm@xmath144 , one will need a relative resolution much better than @xmath145 in the magnetization measurement .",
    "this means a resolution better than 0.1 emu/(mol mn ) , while the actual resolution of our experimental system is of the order of 10 emu/(mol mn ) .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] is illustrative of this point .",
    "it would be very enlightening to perform experiments in single crystals , where we expect that avalanches could be observed .",
    "firstly , as mentioned before , the phase transition found in our diluted ising model ( and in other similar diluted isind models @xcite ) is of the same kind as those found for the random field @xcite and random bond ising models @xcite .",
    "for these last two models it is known that the phase transition in the hysteresis loop is associated with an equilibrium ground state phase transition @xcite .",
    "it is reasonable to think that for our version of the site diluted ising model , there will also exist such a ground state transition from a completely disordered ground state ( small @xmath43 region ) to a ground state with a non - vanishing magnetization ( large @xmath43 region ) . experimentally , there are evidences that in cu - al - mn these two phases correspond to a true spin - glass phase and to a ferromagnetic spin - glass @xcite . in the model ,",
    "whether the two phases can be catalogued as being spin - glass - like would depend on its thermal behavior .",
    "this study is out of the scope of the present work .",
    "secondly , the transition line in the @xmath109 diagram has been located from the maximum of the duration and the inflection of the size of the largest avalanche .",
    "an additional estimation can be obtained by locating the points where the distribution of avalanche sizes becomes power law . except for finite - size effects",
    ", the three estimations should be coincident .",
    "obtaining the transition points accurately using the third method is quite difficult because it is necessary to perform non - linear fits of a power - law with an exponential correction , @xmath146 , in order to locate the point ( @xmath147 ) where the distribution changes from super- ( @xmath148 ) to subcritical ( @xmath149 ) behaviour .",
    "it is much easier to evaluate the exponent @xmath150 characterizing the critical distribution of avalanches , which is not affected by the small exponential corrections close to the critical line .",
    "the obtained value is @xmath151 .",
    "this value can be compared with the values @xmath152 and @xmath153 found for the 3d - random field ising model and the 3d - random bond ising model @xcite .",
    "this agreement of the numerical values reinforces the hypothesis that there exists universality in this kind of models exhibiting flfo phase transitions .",
    "finally , a much deeper question concerns the nature of this critical line . some authors have stated that critical distributions of avalanches do not occur at a certain line but on a broad region due to the existence of the so - called self - organized criticality .",
    "this theory has been proposed for externally driven complex dissipative systems with spatial and temporal degrees of freedom . according to bak",
    "@xcite these systems naturally evolve to a critical state characterized by avalanches with no intrinsic time and length scales .",
    "this results in power - law distributions for avalanches . in this sense",
    "the results we have obtained from the model point in the opposite direction : we are dealing with a true critical line . indeed , for selected values of the model parameters controlling the disorder @xmath73 and @xmath43 , the system exhibits the critical behavior , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] .",
    "we acknowledge benjamn martnez for a helpful colaboration and critical reading of the manuscript .",
    "we also thank ll .",
    "maosa , j. ortn and c. frontera for fruitful discussions .",
    "this work has received finantial support from cicyt ( spain ) project number mat98 - 0315 , and cirit ( catalonia ) project number sgr119 .                                                by `` ferromagnetic spin - glass ''",
    "we understand a phase which , in absence of an applied field , exhibits a large degree of frozen disorder but with clusters with non - zero magnetization .",
    "such structures have also been called cluster glasses or mictomagnetic phases .",
    "see , for instance , c.m.hurd , contemp .",
    "* 23 * , 469 ( 1982 ) .",
    "actually the structure of the system in the martensitic phase is monoclinic but , due to the diffusionless character of the martensitic transition , the atomic environment is very similar in both the bcc and martensitic phase .",
    "since there are antiferromagnetic interactions , inverse avalanches may occur and , in few occasions , a degenerate situation may appear with two energetically equivalent configurations which successively alternate .",
    "in such cases we decide randomly which is the stable one and proceed with the field increment ."
