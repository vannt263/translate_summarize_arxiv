    "borel @xcite was the first mathematician to study normal numbers . in 1909",
    "he gave the following definition .",
    "[ definition : normalborel ] a real number @xmath11 is _ normal in base @xmath7 _ if each of the numbers @xmath17 is simply normal ( in the sense of definition  [ definition : normal ] ) , in each of the bases @xmath18 .     .",
    "borel proved that lebesgue almost every real number is normal , in the sense of definition  [ definition : normalborel ] , in all bases . in 1940 , s. s. pillai @xcite simplified definition  [ definition : normalborel ] by proving that    [ thm : pillai ] for @xmath19 , a real number @xmath11 is normal in base @xmath7 if and only if it is simply normal in each of the bases @xmath18 .",
    "theorem  [ thm : pillai ] was improved in 1951 by i. niven and h. s. zuckerman @xcite who proved    [ thm : nivenzuckerman ] definition  [ definition : normal ] and definition  [ definition : normalborel ] are equivalent .",
    "a simpler proof of theorem  [ thm : pillai ] was given by j. e. maxfield in @xcite .",
    "j. w. s. cassels gave a shorter proof of theorem  [ thm : nivenzuckerman ] in @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that both of these results require some work to establish , but were assumed without proof by several authors .",
    "for example , m. w. sierpinski assumed theorem  [ thm : pillai ] in @xcite without proof .",
    "moreover , d. g. champernowne @xcite , a. h. copeland and p. erds @xcite , and other authors took definition  [ definition : normal ] as the definition of a normal number before it was proven that definition  [ definition : normal ] and definition  [ definition : normalborel ] are equivalent .",
    "more information can be found in chapter 4 of the book of y. bugeaud @xcite .",
    "the following theorem was proven by h. furstenberg in his seminal paper `` disjointness in ergodic theory , minimal sets , and a problem in diophantine approximation ''",

    "it is interesting to note that although furstenberg did not provide an alternate proof of theorem  [ thm : nivenzuckerman ] , he showed that an entirely different definition of normality is equivalent to definition  [ definition : normal ] .",

    "similarly , the core of h. furstenberg s definition deals with testing for blocks in a different way along arithmetic progressions .    the authors feel that the equivalence of definition  [ definition : normal ] and definition  [ definition : normalborel ] and other similar ones is a far more delicate topic than is typically assumed .",
    "recent papers @xcite and @xcite establish that the connection between analagous notions is weaker and more subtle for cantor series expansions .",

    "this system is a perturbation of the system when @xmath221 for all @xmath8 so we would like to understand the unperturbed system . set @xmath222 \\times { \\left [ 1 , 1 + \\frac{1}{t-1 } \\right ] } ^{t-1}.\\ ] ] we conjecture that for all @xmath223 there is a solution @xmath224 .",
    "an implementation of newton s method written in java by the authors suggests that this holds for all @xmath225 .",
    "the following may be solved by hand .",
    "@xmath226 let @xmath227 be a root of @xmath228",

    "let @xmath238 be the splitting field of the polynomial @xmath239 over @xmath240 .",
    "we used the online implementation of magma to compute the galois group of @xmath241 .",
    "thus , @xmath242 where @xmath243 is the subgroup of order @xmath244 of the symmetric group @xmath245 generated by the set of four permutations @xmath246 it is interesting that this group is a proper subgroup of @xmath245 , but it is still not a solvable group .",
    "thus , the roots of @xmath239 may not be expressed in radicals . since @xmath247 is a root of @xmath239 , the point @xmath248",
    "may not be expressed in terms of radicals .",
    "we remark that we can solve the system by iteratively solving each line for one of the variables and replacing every occurrence of this variable in the next lines with the expression obtained from the current line .",
    "this terminates with a polynomial in one of the variables .",
    "a solution of the system then corresponds to a root of this final polynomial with the other variables given by polynomials evaluated at this root .",
    "however these polynomials grow rapidly as @xmath216 increases and give little insight about the regions where these solutions lie .",
    "thus , we feel that a purely algebraic approach is unlikely to give any useful information .",
    "we may prove weaker versions of the theorems we desire to prove without having bounds on the solutions of these systems of equations .",
    "for example taking @xmath249 yields @xmath250 we perturb this approximate solution by multiplying @xmath251 by a factor of @xmath252 or @xmath253 so that the first term @xmath254 is approximately @xmath216 or @xmath255 .",

    "we believe that theorem  [ thm : main ] should hold for every subset of @xmath155 and the restriction we have is an artefact of the approximation we use .",
    "one additional loss of our current approximation is that we are unable to obtain numbers that are in @xmath256 , but only in @xmath257 .",
    "this will no longer be a problem if we no longer have to use this approximation .",

    "we also wish to remark that it is still possible to prove stronger versions of our theorems by only considering underdetermined versions of our system . and",
    "some solutions outside of the region @xmath258 may also be useful .",
    "to prove theorem  [ thm : diffbary ] we will construct a sequence of @xmath8-step markov measures on @xmath259 with stationary distribution uniform over @xmath31 and with entropy converging to @xmath260 .",
    "the set of generic points for these measures will be contained in @xmath261 and the hausdorff dimension of the set of generic points is equal to the entropy of the measure divided by @xmath260 by @xcite .",
    "convergence of the entropy to @xmath260 then completes the proof .",

    "we find by the same estimates @xmath299 for @xmath300 the same estimates give @xmath301 similarly @xmath302 and for @xmath300 @xmath303 we can take @xmath304 sufficiently small and @xmath305 to complete the proof .",
