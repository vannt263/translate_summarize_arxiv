    "the renormalisation group running of the coupling for a fixed number of flavours is legitimate as long as the energy scales under consideration are either far above or below the fermion masses , that is , the relevant thresholds . from the viewpoint of renormalisation theory ,",
    "it is legal to use the fixed flavour schemes even close or across the thresholds , although the freezing out ( by default , we evolve from higher to lower energy scales . ) of heavy flavours is ignored .",
    "sometimes this effect is incorporated by piecing together @xmath0-functions for different integer numbers of flavours exactly at the mass of the flavours which become inactive .",
    "while this procedure might appear somewhat ad hoc , it features already a crucial aspect of the threshold effect , the scale dependence of the @xmath0-function coefficients .",
    "they are no longer scheme independent in the above sense .",
    "the switching also involves a blending between different schemes .",
    "it is plausible that the transition between different numbers of active flavours at a threshold should happen gradually .",
    "therefore , we base the following investigation on a background field momentum subtraction scheme @xcite , which features naturally a smooth switching . momentum subtraction schemes @xcite respect the decoupling theorem @xcite , but , in general , spoil the slavnov  taylor identities .",
    "the latter shortcoming is cured by the use of the background field method @xcite .",
    "alternatively , we could have used the physical charge approach of ref .",
    "the outcome , however , is qualitatively and quantitatively close to that in the background field momentum subtraction scheme ( see especially fig .  2 in @xcite .",
    ") and there the expressions can be handled analytically .",

    "it coincides with the universal @xmath0-function .",
    "we base our suggestion for a mass dependent all - orders @xmath0-function on the postulate that , far away from all thresholds , it reduces to the just mentioned all - order @xmath0-function for a fixed number of flavours . at two - loop order",
    "it is to be identical with the @xmath0-function in background field momentum subtraction scheme @xcite . from the thus obtained mass - dependent @xmath0-function we find that threshold effects are felt two orders of magnitude away from the mass of the fermion .",

    "[ mwt ] . )    one field of research where the mass - dependence of the @xmath0-function is of importance is the conformal window of non - abelian gauge field theories . in the picture",
    "laid out in @xcite , the interplay between the matter content of a theory and chiral symmetry breaking gives rise to different phases as follows ( see fig .  [ beta ] . ) : for no or only little matter the ( dominant ) antiscreening of the non - abelian gauge bosons inhibits the occurrence of an infrared fixed point ( a ) .",
    "this is the case for quantum chromodynamics . for slightly more matter a perturbative caswell  banks ",
    "zaks @xcite fixed point develops . when arguing based on the two - loop @xmath0-function , this amounts to a change of the sign of the second coefficient ( b ) .",
    "this fixed point , however , need not be realised , as , for an insufficient matter content , the value of the coupling may suffice to trigger chiral symmetry breaking . in that case , the fermions acquire a dynamical mass and decouple , at least in parts , from the dynamics .",
    "the effective number of flavours is reduced and the antiscreening dominates again ( c ) . only above a certain amount of matter ,",
    "the fixed point is reached before chiral symmetry breaking sets in .",
    "the coupling constant freezes ( d ) . just before this",
    ", the quasiconformal case is to be found , where the fixed point is almost realised ( e ) .",
    "there the @xmath0-function is small for a value of the coupling @xmath3 close to its critical value for chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "consequently , the coupling stays almost constant ( it walks ) for a large interval of scales before chiral symmetry breaking is triggered and the coupling constant starts running again . beyond a given amount of matter the theory loses asymptotic freedom .",
    "the first coefficient of the @xmath0-function changes sign .",
    "this discussion indicates why the acquisition of ( more ) mass by the fermions is a crucial building block for the understanding of the dynamics of the theory .    the motivation for carrying out the investigation in @xcite was the determination of walking , that is , quasiconformal @xcite technicolour @xcite models , which are consistent with available electroweak precision data @xcite .",
    "\\{walking technicolour models possess a rich collider phenomenology for the large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite as well as dark matter candidates @xcite and are also interesting models for studies in the ads / cft framework @xcite . } in technicolour models , chiral symmetry breaking among fermions ( techniquarks ) added to the standard model without higgs sector simultaneously breaks the electroweak symmetry dynamically .",
    "technicolour hence provides the masses for the weak gauge bosons .",
    "the most intensely researched way to also render massive the standard model fermions is extended technicolour @xcite . apart from this primary purpose , extended technicolour may serve to make extra nambu  goldstone - modes ( three of the potentially more modes arising from the chiral symmetry breaking are absorbed as the longitudinal modes of the weak gauge bosons . ) sufficiently massive , and or stabilise the vacuum alignment @xcite .",
    "the effects from extended technicolour are already in place before the chiral condensate of technicolour forms .",
    "therefore , as shall be explained below , some of the effects connected to the stabilisation of the vacuum alignment and the nambu ",
    "goldstone masses are similar in nature to an explicit mass term in the sense of the electroweakly induced quark masses relative to the chiral dynamics of quantum chromodynamics .",
    "the just described occurrence of walking is due to inherently non - perturbative effects from chiral symmetry breaking . in the context of the mass - dependent @xmath0-function discussed here",
    ", we would like to point out that there is also the possibility to see walking from an interplay of more perturbative effects : let us think of an asymptotically free gauge theory , which would have an infrared fixed point for massless fermions . ",
    "hard \" fermion masses in the sense of , for example , the electroweakly induced quark masses as seen by quantum chromodynamics lead to a reduction of the screening due to the fermions .",
    "if this occurs at the correct energy scale ( here , the occurrence of walking depends on the initial condition for the coupling constant . ) , the infrared fixed point is never reached , but a situation analogous to the one depicted in fig .",

    "they have to be sufficiently massive , as these potentially lightest states of a technicolour theory have not been detected to date .",
    "it turns out that electroweak radiative corrections can take them outside the direct exclusion limit for technimesonic pseudoscalars @xcite , which is slightly above the mass of the weak gauge bosons @xcite . on top of that ,",
    "these extra nambu  goldstone - modes carry technibaryon number and hence , as opposed to technimesons , they can only be produced in pairs .",
    "the positive electroweak contributions to the squared masses of the nambu",
    " goldstone - modes also stabilise the embedding of the electroweak gauge group , which leads to its correct breaking @xcite .",
    "it could have been embedded in such a way that it remains unbroken , but the latter embedding would be destabilised by electroweak radiative corrections .",
    "this is different in the pseudoreal case .",
    "there , the breaking goes to @xmath72 , which yields two uneaten nambu - goldstone - modes .",
    "they receive negative contributions to their squared masses from electroweak radiative corrections .",
    "thus , the embedding that leads to the correct breaking of the electroweak gauge group is destabilised",
    ". it must be stabilised by an additional mechanism , which is usually incorporated with the extended technicolour sector .",
    "in fact , looking at the non-(pseudo)real case , all it takes to provide suitable masses to the weak gauge bosons is an @xmath73 breaking pattern .",
    "hence , above the technicolour scale not the full @xmath70 symmetry has to be preserved , but only the @xmath66 .",
    "looking , for the moment , exclusively at the two - flavour technicolour sector neither with electroweak interactions nor extended technicolour effects , it consists of four weyl fermions , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 . representing the right - handed fields such that they transform as left - handed fields , @xmath78 and @xmath79",
    ", the @xmath70 flavour symmetry becomes apparent .",
    "the assignment of the left and right fields is dictated by the coupling to the electroweak interactions . from the viewpoint of the flavour symmetries ,",
    "the mass terms @xmath80 and @xmath81 are equivalent : imagine , for example , that the four weyl flavours are arranged in a column vector",
    ". then the respective mass terms can be expressed by contraction with the matrices @xmath82 which are linked by an @xmath70 transformation . @xmath83 and @xmath84 are @xmath85 zero and unit matrices , respectively .",
    "the first mass term above , however , breaks the electroweak symmetry , while the second does not ; it breaks the @xmath70 to @xmath86 .",
    "consequently , it contributes to the masses of those nambu ",
    "goldstone - modes , which link left- with right - fields , that is , the modes with non - zero technibaryon number . apart from a direct application to dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking , for which the electroweak symmetry must be unbroken before the chiral condensate is formed , the investigation of the impact of an explicit mass term of @xmath87-type is interesting per se as well as for quantum chromodynamics , and natural for a study in the framework of lattice field theory .    for techniquarks in a pseudoreal representation of the technicolour gauge group , terms which break the @xmath70 flavour symmetry to @xmath66",
    "are needed to stabilise the vacuum .",
    "the motivation for studying additional mass terms of @xmath88-type for real representations ( and yet another motivation for studying it for pseudoreal representations ) is to control the amount of walking or even avoid conformality of an otherwise promising candidate @xcite .",
    "( in fact , it appears to be interesting to compare the implications from our mass - dependent all - order @xmath0-function with results from lattice studies , which is an active field in the context of walking technicolour theories @xcite . ) for this purpose , we do not even have to increase the value of the mass parameter @xmath89 beyond its value when used to make the extra nambu  goldstone - modes sufficiently massive : the extended - technicolour - induced term is of dynamical origin .",
    "thus , arguing based on a gell - mann  oakes  renner relation , @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the extended technicolour contribution to the mass of the corresponding pions , @xmath92 their decay constant and @xmath93 the related techniquark condensate , results in @xmath89 being of @xmath94 as well .",
    "this is where also the technicolour scale is situated .",
    "hence , an interference of related threshold effects with the technicolour phase transition appears natural .",
    "thus , the extended technicolour might affect the technicolour phase transition .",
    "on the other hand , the dynamically generated techniquark mass in the @xmath87 channel can be estimated to be @xcite @xmath95 where for technicolour models with two techniflavours @xmath96 .",
    "@xmath97 is the dimension of the representation of the technicolour gauge group with respect to which the techniquarks transform .",
    "hence , @xmath98 is also of @xmath94 and it seems likely that also the critical value of the coupling @xmath99 is influenced by the presence of @xmath88 .    as another example",
    "consider partially ( electroweakly ) gauged technicolour @xcite . in partially gauged technicolour ,",
    "be it with matter in a single or different simultaneously present representations of the technicolour gauge group , only some of the techniquarks are gauged under the electroweak gauge group .",
    "this is usually done to alleviate constraints from electroweak precision data , in particular , from the oblique parameters . at the same time it allows to bring the theory close to the ( quasi)conformal window .",
    "the part of the techniquarks that is not gauged under the electroweak can be given masses without breaking the electroweak symmetry .",
    "depending on the flavour symmetry among the electroweakly gauged techniquarks of a partially gauged technicolour model , specific mass terms that leave the electroweak symmetry intact might be possible in this sector as well , as was already explained above .      in @xcite , the lower bound of the conformal window in the plane spanned by the number of colours of an @xmath100 theory and the number of flavours",
    "was determined by equating the coupling at the caswell  banks ",

    "was used to determine the lower bound of the conformal window . to this end , it was equated to zero and the value of the anomalous dimension @xmath64 was kept fixed . while the ladder - rainbow - approximation yields a critical value of one , the only theoretically hard upper bound on @xmath64 arises from the requirement of unitarity of the gauge field theory and is two .",

    "the  lower bound of the conformal window \" is moved towards a larger number of flavours . in the presence of massive fermions this term (   \" ) is somewhat abused , here .",
    "clearly , in a theory , where all fermions have a nonzero mass , however tiny it may be , they freeze out for scales far enough below this mass , and we are effectively left with a pure yang  mills theory , where the antiscreening from the gluons is unchallenged .",
    "hence , in a theory in which all flavours are massive , there is strictly speaking no conformal window .",
    "therefore , what above was called ",
    "lower bound of the conformal window \" in the massive case is the phenomenologically decisive minimal number of flavours above which the coupling develops a plateau ( walks ) .",
    "consequently , we should talk of a ",
    "quasiconformal window \" , which in the limit @xmath108 coincides with the conformal window . in the massless case ,",
    "the walking setups were to be found slightly below the lower edge of the conformal window .",
    "( there , above the edge , the theory does evolve into the fixed point . ) in the massive case , in a setup slightly below the modified bound , there will also be at least some walking . in that case , the amount of walking , that is , the range of scales of quasiconformal behaviour , is determined by a direct interplay of the freezing out of the flavours due to the explicit mass and the onset of chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "( independent of walking , a similar interplay between quark mass effects and chiral symmetry breaking exists in quantum chromodynamics for the strange quark . )",
    "if the number of flavours is really below this bound , it never comes near the fixed point and does not show any walking .",
    "if the number of flavours is above this bound ( and the theory is still asymptotically free ) the theory approaches the fixed point very closely and stays in its vicinity until the flavours start decoupling gradually . once the flavours are decoupled sufficiently , the coupling starts running again .",
    "this means also that in such a setting , the position of the low - energy end of the plateau is not determined by the initial conditions for the renormalisation group evolution , but by the value of the fermion masses . as examples we present the quasiconformal windows for @xmath102 and @xmath109 ( @xmath110 ) in fig .",
    "[ pd1 ] and for @xmath103 and @xmath109 in fig .",
    "for comparison , the massless case is also always shown .",
    "( we concentrate here on equal masses for all fermions .",

    "the determination of the conformal window relies on setting the @xmath0-function ( [ maob ] ) equal to zero .",

    "hence , the number of active flavours that counts , at least for this way of determining the quasiconformal window , is @xmath43 .",
    "this aspect together with the fact that @xmath44 is not monotonously interpolating between the limiting cases indicates that @xmath44 or @xmath39 , and actually probably all the @xmath111 or @xmath112 with @xmath113 , encode something else than a mere modification of the number of flavours .    in fig .",
    "[ mwt ] , in order to show the influence of the mass of the fermions , we plot the critical number of flavours as a function of @xmath114 for an @xmath115 field theory with two adjoint dirac flavours , that is , the core of minimal walking technicolour .",
    "first of all , one can see that the switching zone spans four orders of magnitude .",
    "in other words , threshold effects are felt for energy scales , which are a hundred times bigger than the mass of the fermions .",

    "[ pd1 ] and [ pd2 ] for @xmath4 gauge theories , have to be replotted for every value of @xmath45 .",

    "we use the @xmath0-function ( [ maob ] ) to study the impact of explicit fermion masses on the lower bound of the ( quasi)conformal window of the corresponding field theory : effects of the fermion mass can be sensed at scales more than a hundred times bigger than the fermion mass ; ( see fig .",
    "[ mwt ] . ) the lower bound of the ( quasi)conformal window can be moved to a considerably higher number of flavours ; in fact , it can be closed up altogether .",

    "this means that the corresponding theory does not show quasiconformal behaviour for any number of flavours below the value for which asymptotic freedom is lost . in the investigation of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking by walking technicolour theories",
    ", our approach may be useful for studying effects of extended technicolour interactions , which may be primarily required to stabilise the vacuum and/or render additional nambu ",
    "goldstone - modes sufficiently massive .",
    "( these effects interfere with the chiral dynamics of technicolour in a similar way as electroweakly induced masses interfere with the chiral dynamics of quantum chromodynamics . ) additionally , it might be extended technicolour effects that make a theory quasiconformal , which from its bare technicolour structure would be completely conformal and hence , not suited for breaking the electroweak symmetry dynamically .",
    "it would be interesting to address the issue of mass dependence , in particular , and of other extended technicolour effects , in general , in lattice simulations and to contrast them to the present investigation .",
