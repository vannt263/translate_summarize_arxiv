    "charge transport is usually studied by considering current in response to an externally applied bias .",
    "however , there has been growing interest throughout the last decade in mechanisms enabling directed particle motion in nanosystems without applying a net dc - bias . in this respect , ratchets , periodic structures with broken spatial symmetry , _ e.g.",
    "_  saw tooth - type potentials , represent a prominent class .",
    "ratchets in the original sense are devices operating far from equilibrium by converting thermal fluctuations into directed particle transport in the presence of unbiased time - periodic driving  @xcite .",
    "first discovered in the context of ( overdamped ) classical brownian motion  @xcite , the concept of dissipative ratchets was later generalized to the quantum realm  @xcite .",
    "more recently , coherent ratchets and rectifiers have gained increasing attention .",
    "they are characterized by coherent quantum dynamics in the central periodic system in between leads where dissipation takes place .",
    "proposals comprise molecular wires  @xcite and cold atoms in optical lattices @xcite , besides hamiltonian ratchets  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , ratchet - induced charge flow in the coherent regime was first observed in a chain of triangular - shaped lateral quantum dots @xcite and later in lateral superlattices  @xcite .",
    "here we propose a different class of ratchet devices , namely _",
    "spin ratchets _ which act as sources for spin currents with simultaneously vanishing charge , respectively particle currents . to be definite",
    "we consider coherent transport through ballistic mesoscopic conductors in the presence of spin - orbit ( so ) interaction  @xcite .",
    "contrary to particle ratchets , which rely on asymmetries in either the spatially periodic modulation or the time - periodic driving , a so - based ratchet works even for symmetric periodic potentials . as possible realizations we have in mind semiconductor heterostructures with rashba so interaction  @xcite that can be tuned in strength by an external gate voltage allowing to control the spin evolution .    among other features",
    "it is this property which is triggering recent broad interest in semiconductor - based spin electronics  @xcite . also since direct spin injection from a ferromagnet into a semiconductor remains problematic  @xcite , alternatively ,",
    "several suggestions have been made for generating spin - polarized charge carriers without using magnets . in this respect ,",
    "spin pumping appears promising , _ i.e. _  the generation of spin - polarized currents at zero bias via cyclic variation of at least two parameters .",
    "different theoretical proposals based on so  @xcite and zeeman  @xcite mediated spin pumping in non - magnetic semiconductors have been put forward  @xcite and , in the latter case , experimentally observed in mesoscopic cavities  @xcite .",
    "while pumps and ratchets share the appealing property of generating directed flow without net bias , ratchet transport requires only a single driving parameter , the periodic ratchet potential has a strong collective effect on the spin current and gives rise to distinct features such as spin current reversals upon parameter changes .",
    "we consider a two - dimensional coherent ballistic conductor in the plane ( @xmath0 ) connected to two nonmagnetic leads .",
    "the hamiltonian of the central system in presence of rashba so interaction reads @xmath1 here @xmath2 is the effective electron mass , @xmath3 includes the ratchet potential in @xmath4- and a lateral transverse confinement in @xmath5-direction , and @xmath6 denote pauli spin matrices .",
    "the effect of the so coupling with strength @xmath7 is twofold : it is leading to spin precession and it is coupling transversal modes in the confining potential  @xcite .    in view of a ratchet setup",
    "we consider an additional time - periodic driving term @xmath8 due to an external bias potential @xmath9 with zero net bias ( rocking ratchet ) .",
    "we study adiabatic driving ( such that the system can adjust to the instantaneous equilibrium state ) , assuming that the driving period @xmath10 is large compared to the relevant time scales for transmission .",
    "this is the case in related experiments  @xcite .",
    "the entire hamiltonian then reads @xmath11 where @xmath12 describes the spatial distribution of the voltage drop and should in principle be obtained self - consistently from the particle density .",
    "we model spin - dependent transport within a scattering approach assuming that inelastic processes take place only in the reservoirs .",
    "then the probability amplitude for an electron to pass through the conductor is given by the scattering matrix @xmath13 , where @xmath14 denote transverse modes and @xmath15 the spin directions in the incoming and outgoing lead , respectively .",
    "making use of the unitarity of the scattering matrix , @xmath16 , and summing over all open channels in the left ( l ) and right ( r ) lead , respectively , we find the relations @xmath17 for the further analysis , we consider an unbiased square wave driving @xmath18 $ ] , restricted to the values @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) ; generalizations to , _",

    "the ratchet current is then given by the average of the steady - state currents in the two opposite rocking situations , @xmath21/2 $ ] , which we compute within the landauer formalism relating conductance to transmission .",
    "contrary to charge current , spin current is usually not conserved .",
