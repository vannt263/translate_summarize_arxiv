    "structures resulting from stellar explosions represent space laboratories that elucidate the physics of enormous blasts under extreme conditions , and are of fundamental importance to astrophysics .",
    "the representative of this kind of structure is a supernova remnant ( snr ) .",
    "x - ray observations of snrs have provided wide - ranging insights into their plasma physics , shock phenomena , and into cosmic - ray origins ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the time history of an individual snr is generally difficult to track because of the long timescales  comparable to the entirety of human written history  over which typical remnants evolve . with the notable exception of spectacular nearby remnants , such as cas  a ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , our understanding of remnant expansion and evolution has therefore largely depended on theory , numerical simulations , and systematic snapshot observational assessments of objects sampling different evolutionary phases .",
    "this paper presents a different approach to studying the x - ray evolution of an explosion remnant .",
    "we study not a supernova but a `` classical '' nova resulting from a cataclysmic explosion in an accreting binary system comprising a white dwarf and a red dwarf or giant companion .",
    "the released energy and material propagate through the circumstellar environment similar to , but on much smaller scales than , those in supernovae .",
    "classical novae are about 10@xmath2 times smaller in energy , and typically factors of @xmath3@xmath4 times smaller in ejecta mass .",
    "the analogy with supernovae renders a nova remnant a miniature snr with a short life : its full dynamical evolution occurs on a timescale comparable with a human lifetime and can potentially be followed in x - rays by multi - epoch imaging spectroscopy .",
    "our target is nova persei 1901 ( hereafter gk per ) , which hosts the largest known x - ray emitting nebula centered on a white dwarf binary @xcite . in the following , we start by comparing _ chandra _ cycle-1 data of gk per obtained in 2000 with our recent observation in cycle-15 obtained in 2013 .",
    "the earlier data have been analyzed in detail by @xcite who characterized the shock conditions , energetics of the remnant , and the shocked mass . here , we use the second epoch data to examine the remnant expansion , cooling and fading , and discuss the results in the context of the physics of expanding explosion remnants .",
    "gk  per is a magnetic white dwarf binary at the distance of 470  pc @xcite that underwent a classical nova outburst on 1901 february 21 @xcite .",
    "light echoes from the event photographed in 1901 and 1902 illuminated a complex of shell - like structures around the central object @xcite that @xcite and @xcite interpreted as part of an old planetary nebula .",
    "this nebula is also apparent as a vaguely bipolar - shaped structure , elongated in the northwest - southeast direction , in the light of h@xmath5 , [ ]  @xmath6 5007 , and the _ iras _ 100  @xmath7 m band .",
    "@xcite noted that the lack of the sort of reflection features seen in gk  per around other novae indicates that the grain density around gk  per is unusually high  in keeping with the planetary nebular origin suggested by @xcite .    the extended nova remnant and its evolution has been imaged extensively in the optical over several decades ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite found a possible deceleration of the ejecta after 1950 for the period 19012003 , suggesting that the remnant is in a transition to an adiabatic phase .",
    "a typical expansion rate of the outermost optical knots in 20042011 was 0@xmath030@xmath05  yr@xmath1 , corresponding to a velocity of 6001000  km  s@xmath1 @xcite , which is similar to the 19951997 results found by @xcite .",
    "the various properties of the remnant were discussed in detail by @xcite .",
    "the long axis of the bipolar and _ iras _ 100  @xmath7 m map lies in the northwest - southeast direction , and essentially orthogonal to the northeast - southwest axis ( of symmetry of the x - ray remnant , see below ) .",
    "@xcite concluded that the nova ejecta are interacting with a cone of this pre - existing ambient medium in the southwest where the remnant appears brightest .",
    "this region also corresponds to a particularly bright structure lying at an angular separation of approximately 0@xmath051@xmath8 from the central star in the 1901 and 1902 images by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested this might be a cone of material ejected during the planetary nebular phase suggested by @xcite and that the remnant is being decelerated by interaction with this material .",
    "@xcite also showed that the remnant expansion was consistent with an adiabatic evolution in a medium with density declining with the inverse square of the radial distance . here the @xcite analysis was based on data obtained up until the late 1980 s , and @xcite discussed subsequent observations made until 2003 , presenting evidence that the deceleration of the blast expansion had decreased since 1987 .",
    "they concluded that the density into which the southwest quadrant was expanding in the later data was lower that in 1987 by a factor of about 7 .",
    "regarding non - optical wavelengths , non - thermal radio emission indicating the presence of accelerated electrons interacting with the remnant magnetic field was detected in the southwest quadrant by @xcite , who estimated that a minimum of 1% of the 10@xmath9  erg explosion energy has gone into the non - thermal electrons and the magnetic field . in the x - ray regime ,",

    "data were obtained from the _ hubble _ legacy archive , and we retrieved the h@xmath60 [ ] image taken by the wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) in 1995  see @xcite for further details .",
    "the _ vla _",
    "observations were discussed by e.g. , @xcite , and the 1.45  ghz l - band image taken by the b - configuration in 1997 was obtained from the national radio astronomy observatory _ vla _",
    "archive survey ( nvas ) system @xcite .",
    "we combined the data from the different wavelength regimes using the saoimage ds9 image analysis tool @xcite , rendering radio , optical , and x - rays in red , green , and blue , respectively .",
    "the conspicuous coincidence of the radio and x - ray emission , concentrated at the bright rim to the southwest , was noted by @xcite , who also presented comparisons with optical image contours .",
    "unfortunately , our additional data provide no further insights into the non - thermal hard x - ray signatures reported by @xcite because of the background contamination above about 1  kev .",
    "we investigated this non - thermal emission by first fitting the extracted spectra from both epochs in the 1.27.0 kev range using an absorbed power - law model and estimating the 1@xmath51 statistical uncertainties in the power - law normalization . using these , we calculated count rates in the 0.51.2 kev range by extrapolation .",
    "the fitted power - law slopes were approximately zero , and the resulting upper limits to the contribution of power - law component to the count rate are 10% and 23% for the first and second observations , respectively .",
    "the larger limit from the second epoch results from the larger uncertainty in the fitted slope for those data .",
    "however , it is unlikely that the harder component has increased in intensity or hardness while the rest of the remnant has faded significantly .",
    "to place a best estimate on the soft x - ray power - law emission contribution , we therefore imposed additional constraints of not allowing either the spectrum to get harder or the normalization to increase from the first epoch to the second .",
    "we introduced a lower limit to the power - law slope and an upper limit to the normalization corresponding to the 1@xmath51 limits derived from the first observation and found a 1@xmath51 limit of an 18% contribution due to the harder component , although the actual contribution is likely similar to the 10% one of the earlier epoch .",
    "since the power - law spectrum would be essentially flat , it has little influence on the interpretation of the soft x - ray data and we disregard it in the remainder of the analysis .      in order to examine the expansion of the remnant between the two _ chandra _ observation epochs , the projected and summed profile of the bright southwest rim was analyzed .",
    "a rectangular extraction region was placed on top of , and tangential to , the rim ( indicated by the red rectangles lying to the southwest in figure  [ fg : im ] ) , and x - ray events were extracted and summed in the tangential direction such that the resulting histogram shows the variation of integrated flux ( if ) in an approximately radial direction from the nebula center .    figure  [ fg : proj ] illustrates the projection profiles of these brightest regions in the x - ray images of both epochs . comparing the profiles at their peaks suggests an observed expansion of 1@xmath05 , while at half maxima linear interpolation indicates 1@xmath09 in 13.8 years .",
    "these two estimates are significantly larger than any systematic error in the relative positional accuracy of the two observations . in the following ,",
    "we adopt the measurement based on the half maxima for discussing the remnant expansion .    radial surface brightness ( sb ) profiles derived by azimuthally summing the observed signal as a function of radial distance from the central binary position , with a 0@xmath05 step size , are shown in figure  [ fg : rpf ] .",
    "also shown is a 0.6  kev point spread function ( psf ) calculated using the _ chandra _ ray tracer tool @xcite .",
    "comparison of the central source counts as a function of radius with the psf prediction indicates the source is heavily piled up in the center .",
    "the excess counts over the psf model out to about 10@xmath61 are then expected to arise as a result of the psf being normalized to the peak counts , although it is possible some of the excess could be extended emission from the remnant .",

    "the remnant signals for further spectral analysis were extracted from annular regions between 20@xmath6160@xmath61 , avoiding potential contamination from the psf wings .",
    "background events were accumulated from the 70@xmath61100@xmath61 annular region , excluding the areas where diffuse emission was detected by the ` vtpdetect ` algorithm ( see figure  [ fg : im ] for details ) , and the background rate was computed by normalizing to the ratio of net source and background extraction regions .",
    "the azimuthal dependence of the nebular emission was investigated by assessing the source and background counts in 45@xmath63 segments of their respective annular extraction regions and rotating these segments in the clockwise direction with a 1@xmath63 step size .",
    "the resulting ifs as a function of azimuth computed using both the rotating background sector and just the average background in the annulus ( again with diffuse emission excluded ) are illustrated in figure  [ fg : az ] .",
    "the results reflect the `` by - eye '' assessment that the brightest part of the remnant is in the south and the faintest in the east .",
    "the ratios between 2000 and 2013 curves indicate that the flux decline is inversely related to x - ray brightness  fainter regions are getting more faint at a faster rate than brighter regions .",
    "a simple average of the if ratios is about 70% , with a maximum ratio of 90% in the bright area to the south , and down to 20% to the northwest .      as no significant secular trends , except for background variations , were found in the light curves constructed from the background - subtracted remnant events , spectral analysis proceeded based on the whole of each data set .",
    "background - subtracted x - ray spectra from both epochs are illustrated in figure  [ fg : spec ] .",
    "emission from k@xmath5 was clearly present in both epochs , while emission is also possibly discernible .",
    "we applied a fitting model comprising emission from a non - equilibrium ionization collision - dominated plasma plus photoelectric interstellar absorption ( tebingen - boulder absorption ; @xcite ) with a hydrogen - equivalent column density ( @xmath64 ) fixed at 2.1@xmath1610@xmath22  cm@xmath17 .",
    "the absorption column was not well - constrained by the _",
    "chandra _ data and the latter was estimated from the maps of @xcite for a 1@xmath63 cone radius around the gk  per position .",
    "here we experimented first with allowing the plasma abundances of c , n , o , and ne to vary from their solar values , as might be expected in the shell of a planetary nebula and also in the ejecta of a classical nova .",
    "as a result no significant constraint on the c abundance has been given from the spectral fitting .",
    "regarding the n emission , the best - fits and 1@xmath51 statistical errors suggest an abundance of 0.32.7 times the solar value .",
    "the reason for such poor constraints is that the energies of the k@xmath5 emission lines from those metals are slightly below the useful low energy cut - off of the x - ray spectra .",
    "we confirmed that varying the c and n abundances provides no significant difference on other parameters , and thus the elemental abundances of the emission component were fixed to be solar , except for o and ne from which the energies of the k@xmath5 lines are in the range of the extracted spectra .",
    "for the final spectral fitting , the free parameters were then : ( 1 ) plasma temperature ( @xmath65 ) , ( 2 ) elemental abundances of o ( @xmath66 ) and ne ( @xmath67 ) , ( 3 ) the non - equilibrium plasma ionization timescale ( @xmath33 ) , and ( 4 ) a volume emission measure ( @xmath68 ) .",

    "the observed temperature of 0.20.3  kev implies a total cooling coefficient of order 10@xmath10010@xmath101  erg  @xmath76  s@xmath1 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . here ,",
    "the dominant cooling occurs from the line emission of fe @xcite .",
    "since the shocked circumstellar environment is likely to have a chemical composition more like that of typical planetary nebulae , the actual cooling coefficient could differ from this value  the tendency of the fe depletion in galactic planetary nebulae @xcite suggests that the plasma cooling becomes less effective also in the gk  per remnant .",
    "the cooling timescale is therefore orders of magnitude longer than the present lifetime of the remnant .",
    "as the temperature was almost constant during 20002013 as expected , the radiated energy integrated over 13.8  years is of order 10@xmath10210@xmath103  ergs or lower .",
    "this strongly suggests that radiative cooling is negligible in comparison with the explosion energy of order 10@xmath9  ergs , and supports earlier conclusions that the remnant is in the adiabatic phase @xcite .",
    "we thus conclude that the most plausible cause of the 3040% decline in emission between 20002013 is not the plasma cooling but just the thinning and expansion of the emitting nebula . assuming the blast velocity of 500  km  s@xmath1 , the emitting volume increased 20% in 13.8  years .",
    "were the blast wave expanding into a medium of uniform density , the increase in swept - up mass combined with an increase in the shocked gas volume in the expression for the emission measure , means the x - ray emission should increase with the cube of the remnant radius . in the sedov phase , since @xmath73 @xmath104 @xmath105 ,",
    "the emission measure should increase with time as @xmath68 @xmath104 @xmath106 . that this is definitely not the case indicates that the medium into which the gk  per remnant has been recently expanding must be non - uniform . indeed , as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sc : target ] , the complex non - uniform nature of the circumbinary medium of gk  per has been evident for more than a century .",
    "the observed decline in x - ray emission corresponds best to the case of negligible swept - up mass during 20002013 and therefore a number density at the shock front in the later epoch much lower than at earlier times .",
    "the later volume emission measure @xmath68 @xmath10 @xmath79 would then be about 80% of the 2000 value .",
    "the inverse relation between the x - ray brightness and the decline rate found in the azimuthally - dependent data indicates that the currently fainter regions are fainter because they have dimmed more rapidly , and continue to do so .",
    "this is especially prominent to the east , at an azimuthal angle of around 270@xmath63 .",
    "these regions might be fading faster because they are expanding more rapidly , although the x - ray data are insufficient to test this .",
    "asymmetric expansion is _ not _ see in the optical knots @xcite which actually experienced a recent brightening in the east .",
    "such divergent behaviors are not unrealistic since optical knots are probably dominated by shocked ejecta and we expect the x - ray emission to instead originate largely from the shocked medium .",
    "comparison of the x - ray and optical emission in the multi - wavelength image in figure  [ fg : fox ] reveals that some optical knots precede the x - ray emitting shock front .",
    "similar behavior has been seen in optical knots of the cas  a supernova remnant @xcite .",
    "the main shell of the brightest knots is quasi - spherical , and close inspection of the x - ray emission indicates that it is co - spatial with knots .",
    "this indicates that the knots are likely not the same material as the x - ray emitting plasma that has condensed and cooled , and is consistent with the knots being shocked ejecta ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the most obvious departure of optical and x - ray morphology is in the x - ray `` wings '' pointing to the north and east that extend well beyond the optical knots .",
    "@xcite noted that the expansion rate for these wing regions must be about 26002800  km  s@xmath1  more than twice the rate of the optical knots and the bright emission in the southwest  and drew comparison to the `` cone '' of earlier ejected material proposed in the planetary nebula scenario by @xcite . the implication would be that we are still seeing largely the shocked medium , but that the density experienced by the blast in these wing directions up until encountering the denser material must have been much lower than in the southwest direction to permit the more rapid expansion",
    "comparison of _ chandra _ x - ray imaging spectroscopy observations of the remnant of the gk  per classical nova event of 1901 obtained in 2000 and 2013 has revealed the following results .    1 .",
    "the remnant faded significantly in the interval between the two observations , with a mean flux decline of 3040% .",
    "the rate of fading is spatially dependent , with more rapid fading generally coinciding with regions of lower surface brightness .",
    "2 .   comparison of x - ray and optical data confirms qualitatively the very different morphology of cool knots and hot gas .",
    "the highly asymmetric x - ray remnant contrasts with a quasi - spherical shell of complex knots .",
    "some optical knots appear to be slightly ahead of the x - ray emitting shock front , and also appear x - ray dark .",
    "the expansion of the remnant deduced from the difference in the bright rim of x - ray mission to the southwest in the two different epochs is 1@xmath09 , or an expansion rate of 0@xmath014  yr@xmath1 .",
    "this corresponds to velocity of approximately 300  km  s@xmath1 for a distance to gk  per of 470  pc .",
    "4 .   assuming the x - ray emission arises from a relatively thin shell of shocked plasma , the swept - up mass is approximately 2@xmath1610@xmath88  @xmath89 and the ion density is 4  cm@xmath18 .",
    "a sedov - taylor solution yields an explosion energy of 2@xmath1610@xmath9  ergs , and electrons and ions are close to temperature equilibration .",
    "since the radiative cooling time of the shock - heated gas is much longer than the age of the remnant , we conclude that the x - ray fading is a result of adiabatic expansion at a rate of about 3% per year in the southwest rim . the more drastic fading in regions of low surface brightness , such as in the east of the remnant ,",
    "is then expected to be caused by more rapid expansion into a lower - density medium .",
    "the general evolution of the remnant is qualitatively consistent with expectations based on early post - explosion photographs of pre - existing nebulosity , with a highly - structured and inhomogeneous shell - like morphology .",
    "the fading observed between 2000 and 2013 is then caused by the recent expansion of the remnant into regions of much lower density .",
    "this is consistent with a planetary nebula origin for the pre - blast circumstellar material illuminated by light echoes from the explosion itself .",
