    "recently , much attention has been paid to two - dimensional ( 2d ) optical ring - resonator lattices as a platform for topological photonics , synthetic gauge field , and many - body physics of photons @xcite .",
    "many interesting phenomena such as the hofstadter butterfly @xcite and chiral edge states @xcite can emerge in the systems , by their analogy to quantum hall systems .",
    "actually , the ring - resonator lattice can be viewed as an optical realization of the chalker - coddingnton ( cc ) network model @xcite , which was introduced to simulate the anderson localization in quantum hall systems .",
    "the cc network model without disorder is an unconventional floquet - bloch system without any time - periodic drive @xcite .",
    "it hosts the so - called anomalous floquet insulator phase @xcite , which has chiral edge states even if the chern number is zero @xcite .",
    "moreover , unpaired dirac cone emerges at the phase boundary between the anomalous floquet insulator and normal insulator phases @xcite such exotic behaviors of the model enable us to investigate its three - dimensional ( 3d ) generalization .    in the previous works @xcite , the author studied 3d generalizations of the cc network model , having their optical realization by ring resonators in mind . in ref .",
    ", we show that a multilayer stacking of the cc model with interlayer scattering channels exhibits 3d topological phases of gapless and gapped band structures .",
    "in particular , weyl points emerge in a robust manner in certain parameter regions . there , the system is in the floquet - weyl ( fw ) phase .",
    "the weyl points disappear by a formation of line nodes and the system turns into either nontopological or topological gapped phases .",
    "we call these phases the normal insulator ( ni ) and floquet topological insulator ( fti ) phases , respectively .",
    "similar fw and fti phases are obtained in a 3d waveguide network @xcite , which can be viewed as another 3d generalization of the cc network model .",
    "it was also pointed out in ref .",
    ", that the stacked 2d network model can host 3d synthetic gauge fields just by adjusting the structure .",
    "the gauge fields are for photons in the corresponding ring - resonator lattice , although photons themselves are gauge bosons .",
    "the model can also host a pseudospin - orbit interaction ( psoi ) by regarding the degenerate clockwise and counter - clockwise modes of the rings as a bosonic pseudospin .",
    "it is interesting how the synthetic gauge fields and psoi affect the topological phases .",
    "this question is important not only from a fundamental - physics viewpoint but also from a practical viewpoint .",
    "how are the resulting surface states , which can be used for a novel optical waveguide , robust against perturbations ?",
    "such a question highlights distinct features of our bosonic model compared to conventional electronic systems . in electronic systems",
    ", it is well established that topological bands are accompanied by characteristic surface states . for weyl semimetals , surface states called fermi arc emerge @xcite .",
    "their dispersion curve connects two weyl points ( of opposite chiralities ) projected on the surface brillouin zone . for topological insulators ,",
    "gapless dirac - cone surface states emerge .",
    "they are robust against various perturbations and are protected by the kramers degeneracy due to the time - reversal symmetry ( trs ) @xcite .",
    "these properties ere expected to share , in part , in our model .",
    "however , our system is completely bosonic , and can be viewed as a floquet system .",
    "these distinct features may disturb to draw a simple analogy with conventional electronic systems .    in this paper , we investigate effects of the synthetic gauge fields and psoi in the stacked 2d ring - network lattice . a synthetic magnetic field implemented in the lattice yields a 3d analogue of the hofstadter butterfly and nontrivial topology in the bulk band structure . the latter property results in emergence of gapless surface states that are not allowed in the system without the gauge field .",
    "a simple relation of the bulk - edge correspondence is also drawn .",
    "the psoi is shown to break the fti phase , whereas the fw phase can be preserved by breaking the sis .",
    "we also consider the compatibility between the synthetic gauge field and psoi .",
    "we found that it requites a certain nonreciprocity .",

    "iii , synthetic gauge fields are implemented .",
    "a 3d analogue of the hofstadter butterfly is presented , and nontrivial topology due to the gauge fields is investigated .",
    "section iv is devoted to study effects of psoi in the topological phases of the system without the psoi . finally in sec .",
