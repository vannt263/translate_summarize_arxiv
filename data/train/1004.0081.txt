    "optical systems offer a highly promising route to quantum information processing and quantum computing . the seminal work of ref .",
    "@xcite showed that even with linear optical gate arrays alone and appropriate photon counting measurements , efficient linear optical computing is possible .",
    "the resource overhead of this proof - of - principle architecture for quantum computing was reduced , indeed by orders of magnitude , by directly making use of the idea of measurement - based quantum computing with cluster states @xcite .",
    "such an approach is appealing for many reasons , the reduction of resource overheads only being one , but also for a clearcut distinction between creation of entanglement as a resource and its consumption in computation .",
    "this idea was further developed into the continuous - variable ( cv ) version thereof @xcite , aiming at avoiding limitations related to efficiencies of creation and detection of single photons . in this context ,",
    "gaussian states play a quite distinguished role as they can be created by passive optics , optical squeezers and coherent states , i.e. , the states produced by a usual laser @xcite : indeed , gaussian cluster states form a promising resource for instances of quantum computing with light .",
    "such a cv - scheme allows for a deterministic preparation of the resource states while the schemes based on linear optics with single photons require preparation methods which are intrinsically probabilistic .",
    "gpeps on an arbitrary graph , here one representing a cubic lattice .",
    "( a ) the connected dots represent two - mode squeezed states , the circles denote the vertices where the gaussian projections are being performed .",
    "( b ) the resulting gpeps after local gaussian projections have been performed on the virtual systems .",
    "any gaussian cluster state can be prepared in this fashion.,width=279 ]    in this work , we however highlight and flesh out some limitations of such an approach .",
    "we do so in order to sharpen the exact requirements that any scheme for cv quantum computing based on gaussian cluster states eventually will have to fulfill , and what quantum error correction and fault tolerant approaches eventually have to deliver .",
    "specifically , we will show that gaussian local measurements alone will not suffice to transport quantum information across the lattice , even on complicated lattices described by an arbitrary graph of finite dimension : any influence of local measurements is confined to a local region , except from exponentially suppressed corrections .",
    "this can be viewed as an impossibility of gaussian error correction in the measurement - based setting .",
    "what is more , even under non - gaussian measurements , this obstacle can not be overcome , in order to transport or process quantum information along slabs of a finite width : any influence of local measurements will again exponentially decay with the distance .",
    "this observation suggests that  although the initial state is perfectly known and pure  finite squeezing has to be tackled with a full machinery of quantum error correction and fault tolerance @xcite , yet to be developed for this type of system and presumably giving rise to a massive overhead .",
    "no local measurements or suitable sophisticated encodings of qubits in finite slabs  reminding , e.g. , of encodings of the type of ref .",
    "@xcite can uplift the initial state to an almost perfect universal resource . in order to arrive at this conclusion , in some ways",
    ", we will explore ideas of measurement - based computing beyond the one - way model @xcite as introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite and further developed in refs .",
    "we will highlight the technical results as `` observations '' , and discuss implications of these results in the main text . while these findings do not constitute a `` no - go '' argument for gaussian cluster states",
    ", they do seem to require a very challenging prescription for quantum error correction and further highlight the need for identifying alternative schemes for cv quantum computing , specifically ones based on _ non - gaussian cv states_. _ small scale implementations _ of _ _ g__aussian cluster state computing are , as we will see , are also _ not _ affected by these limitations .    to sketch the structure of this article : in section [ sec : gpeps ] we will first discuss the concept of gaussian projected entangled pair states ( gpeps ) , forming a family of states including the physical cv gaussian cluster state . in section [ sec : gops ] we will then discuss the impact of gaussian measurements on gpeps and show that under this restriction the localizable entanglement in every gpeps decays exponentially with the distance between any two points on arbitrary lattice .",
    "this has also implications on gaussian quantum - repeaters , which we investigate in detail .",
    "after this , we leave the strictly gaussian stage in section [ sec : nogauss ] and investigate present our main result when showing that under more general measurements on gpeps , quantum information processing in finite slabs is still not possible .",
    "we discuss requirements for error correction , before presenting concluding remarks .",
    "before we turn to measurement - based quantum computing ( mbqc ) on cv - states , we briefly review some basic elements of the theory of gaussian states and operations which are needed in this article @xcite .",
    "readers familiar with these concepts can safely skip this section .",
    "although the statements made in this work apply on all physical systems described by _",
    "quadratures _ or _",
    "canonical coordinates _ , including , e.g. , micromechanical oscillators , we have a _ quantum optical system _ in mind and often use language from this field as well .",
    "any system of @xmath0 bosonic degrees of freedom , e.g. , @xmath0 light modes , can be described by canonical coordinates @xmath1 and @xmath2 , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) annihilates ( creates ) a photon in the respective mode .",
    "when we collect these @xmath6 canonical coordinates in a vector @xmath7 , we can write the commutation relations as @xmath8=i\\sigma_{j , k}$ ] , where the _ symplectic matrix _ @xmath9 is given by @xmath10.\\ ] ] _ gaussian states _ are fully characterized by their first and second moments alone .",
    "the _ first moments _ form a vector @xmath11 with entries @xmath12 while the second moments , which capture the fluctuations , can be collected in a @xmath13-matrix @xmath14 , the so - called _ covariance matrix _ , with entries @xmath15.\\ ] ]",
    "hence , gaussian states are complete characterized by @xmath11 and @xmath14 . _ gaussian unitaries",
    "_ , i.e. , unitary transformations acting in hilbert space preserving the gaussian character of the state correspond to symplectic transformations on the cm .",
    "they in turn correspond so maps @xmath16 with @xmath17 .",
    "the set of such _",
    "symplectic transformations _ forms the group @xmath18 . a set of particularly important example gaussian states are the _ coherent states _",
    ", for which the state vectors read in the photon number basis @xmath19 and are described by @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "single mode _ squeezed states _ are characterized by lower fluctuations in one phase - space coordinate .",
    "the cm can in a suitable basis then be written as @xmath22 with @xmath23 .",
    "the first proposal for mbqc on cv states has been based on so - called _ gaussian cluster states _ and works in almost complete analogy to the qubit case @xcite .",
    "as such , the formulation is based on `` infinitely squeezed '' and hence unphysical states using infinite energy in preparation : it can be created by initializing every mode in the @xmath24 `` eigenstate '' of @xmath25 ( formally an improper eigenstate of momentum , a concept that can be made rigorous , e.g. , in an algebraic formulation @xcite ) .",
    "this is the cv - analogue to the state vector @xmath26 in the qubit case .",
    "then the operation @xmath27 , the analogue to the @xmath28 gate , is applied between all adjacent modes .",
    "this state allows universal mbqc to be performed with gaussian and one non - gaussian measurement .",
    "the state as such is not physical and not contained in hilbert space .",
    "the argument , however , is that it should be expected that a finitely squeezed version inherits essentially the same properties . replacing them by finitely squeezed ones we obtain a state which we will call a _",
    "physical gaussian cluster state_.",
    "_ projected entangled pair states ( peps ) _ or _ tensor product states _ have been used for qubits to generalize _ matrix product states ( mps ) _ or _ finitely correlated states _",
    "@xcite from one - dimensional chains to arbitrary graphs @xcite .",
    "one suitable of defining them is via a valence - bond construction : one can create a state by placing entangled pairs  constituting `` virtual systems''on every bond of the lattice and then applying a suitable projection to a single mode at every lattice site .",
    "these projections , often taken to be equal , together with the specification of the initial entangled states , then serve as a description of the resulting state . _",
    "mps for gaussian states _ ( gmps ) have been studied to obtain correlation functions and entanglement scaling in one - dimensional chains @xcite .    in this work",
    "we focus on _ gaussian peps ( gpeps ) _ which can be obtained from non - perfectly entangled pairs .",
    "the bonds we consider are _ two - mode squeezed states ( tmss ) _ , the state vectors of which have the photon number representation @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the _ squeezing parameter_. we will denote the corresponding density matrix by @xmath31 . for @xmath32",
    "the state becomes `` maximally entangled '' , but this limit is not physical because it is not normalizable and has infinite energy as already mentioned above .",
    "we will , therefore , carefully analyze the effects stemming from the fact that @xmath33 .",

    "this number @xmath36 will also be referred to as the _ squeezing parameter _ in case there is no risk of mistaking one for the other . it is also known that any pure bi - partite multi - mode gaussian state can be brought into the tensor product of tmss @xcite by means of local unitary gaussian operations , each having a cm in the above form .",
    "then the largest @xmath36 in the vector of resulting tmss will be referred to as its squeezing parameter .",
    "we will also discuss gpeps on general graphs @xmath37 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gpeps ] .",
    "vertices @xmath38 here correspond to physical systems , edges @xmath39 to connections of neighborhood . on any such graph",
    ", @xmath40 is the natural graph - theoretical distance between two vertices . as we will often consider the system of bonds before the projection operation",
    "is performed , we employ the following notation : when we speak of operations on _ virtual systems _ when thinking of collective operations on modes before the projection is applied , and often emphasize when we refer to a single physical system with hilbert space @xmath41 .",
    "note that we also allow for more than one edge between two vertices of a graph .",
    "when a particular vertex has @xmath0 adjacent bonds , the projection map is a gaussian operation of the form @xmath42 this operation can always be made trace - preserving @xcite , in quite sharp contrast to the situation in the finite - dimensional setting .",
    "this operation will also be referred to as gaussian _",
    "peps projection_. this operation can always be realized by mixing single - mode squeezed state on a suitably tuned beam splitter which means that _ inline _ squeezers are not necessary @xcite .",
    "note that any such state could also be used as a variational state to describe ground states of many - body systems and by construction satisfies an _ entanglement area law _ @xcite .",
    "in this section , we will discuss gaussian operations on a gpeps and derive some statements on entanglement swapping , the localizable entanglement , and the usefulness as a resource for mbqc . since all measurements are assumed to be gaussian as well ,",
    "this is as such not yet a full statement on universality , but already shows that the natural operations for transport of logical information in such a gaussian cluster state does not work with such local measurements .",
    "the _ localizable entanglement ( le ) _ between two sites @xmath43 and @xmath44 of the graph @xmath37 is defined by the maximal entanglement obtainable on average when performing projective measurements at all sites but @xmath43 and @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "when we require both the initial state and the measurements to be gaussian @xcite , the situation simplifies as the entanglement properties do not depend on the measurement outcomes @xcite .",
    "thus , we do not need to average but only find the best measurement strategy . to be specific",
    ", we will measure the entanglement in terms of the _ logarithmic negativity _ which can be defined as @xcite @xmath45 where @xmath46 denotes the _ partial transpose _ with respect to subsystem @xmath43 and @xmath47 the trace - norm and we use the natural logarithm . for a tmss ,",
    "@xmath39 coincides with the squeezing parameter by @xmath48 .",
    "it is important to note , however , that this choice has only been made for notational convenience : in our statements on asymptotic degradation of entanglement , any other measure of entanglement would also do , specifically the entropy of entanglement for pure gaussian states , and for mixed states the _ distillable entanglement _ or the _ entanglement cost_.    we will mostly focus on two variants of the concept of localizable entanglement : whenever we only allow for gaussian local measurements , we will refer to this quantity as _",
    "gaussian localizable entanglement _",
    ", abbreviated as @xmath49 .",
    "then , we will consider the situation when we ask for fixed subspaces @xmath50 and @xmath51 in the hilbert spaces associated with sites @xmath43 and @xmath44 to get entangled by means of local measurements .",
    "we then refer to as _ subspace localizable entanglement _ @xmath52 .",
    "both concept directly relate to transport in measurement - based quantum computing .",
    "the task of localizing entanglement in a peps is closely related to one of _ entanglement swapping _",
    "in this situation we have three parties , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath53 where both @xmath43 and @xmath44 and @xmath44 and @xmath53 share an entangled pair each .",
    "then @xmath44 , consisting of @xmath54 and @xmath55 , is allowed to perform an arbitrary gaussian operation on his parts of the two pairs followed by a measurement .",
    "the task is to choose the operation in such a way that the resulting entanglement between @xmath43 and @xmath44 is maximum .    for two pairs of entangled tmss shared between @xmath43 and @xmath54 and @xmath54 and @xmath53 ,",
    "the supremum of maximum achievable negativity between @xmath43 and @xmath53 by a local gaussian measurement in @xmath56 is approximated by the measurement that best approximates a gaussian bell measurement .",

    "the most significantly entangled bond has the strength @xmath59.,width=166 ]    we consider the situation of having a tmss ( [ eq : tmss ] ) @xmath60 with some @xmath61 and restricting the operation on @xmath44 to be gaussian .",
    "furthermore , we allow for operations which do not succeed with unit probability .",
    "we have to allow for general local gaussian operations , and also for arbitrary local additional gaussian resources , with cm @xmath62 on modes @xmath63 , on an arbitrary number of modes .",
    "the initial covariance matrix of the system hence reads @xmath64 without loss of generality , one can assume that one performs a single projection onto a pure gaussian state on all modes referring to @xmath44 . ordering modes to @xmath43 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath63 , one can write the cm in block form as @xmath65 , \\ ] ] @xmath66 referring to @xmath43 , @xmath53 and @xmath67 to @xmath54 , @xmath55 .",
    "when we now project the modes @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath63 onto a pure gaussian state with cm @xmath68 , the cm of the resulting state of @xmath43 and @xmath53 , postselected on that outcome , is given by the schur - complement @xcite , @xmath69      -      \\left[\\begin{array}{cc }      v & 0\\\\      \\end{array}\\right ]      \\left (      \\left[\\begin{array}{cc }      w & 0\\\\      0 & \\gamma_{b_3 }      \\end{array }      \\right ]      + \\gamma\\right)^{-1 }      \\left[\\begin{array}{c }      v^t\\\\ 0\\\\      \\end{array}\\right].\\ ] ] any symplectic operation @xmath70 applied to @xmath44 before the measurement can of course also be just absorbed into the choice of the cm @xmath68 .",

    "since @xmath73 and the same holds for the subblock on @xmath63 of @xmath68 , these matrices are clearly positive . using operator monotonicity of the inverse function ,",
    "one finds that @xmath74 holds , since @xmath75 .",
    "therefore , @xmath76 with a matrix @xmath77 . here",
    "@xmath78 is the cm following the same protocol , but where @xmath68 is replaced by the identical cm , but with @xmath79 .",
    "to arrive at such a cm is always possible and still gives rise to a valid cm by virtue of the pinching inequality .",
    "this is yet merely the covariance matrix of the a gaussian state , subjected to additional classically correlated gaussian noise . in other words",
    ", it is always optimal to treat @xmath63 as an innocent bystander and not to perform an entangling measurement between @xmath54 and @xmath55 on the one hand and @xmath63 on the other hand , quite consistent with what one could have intuitively assumed .",
    "we can hence focus on the situation when @xmath63 is absent and we merely project onto a pure gaussian state in @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "it is then easy to see that there is no optimal choice , but the supremum can be better and better approximated by considering more and more squeezed tmss ( or `` infinitely squeezed states '' in the first place ) , i.e. , on @xmath80 in the limit of @xmath81 , which is the cv - analogue to the bell state for qudits .",
    "this measurement can be realized by mixing @xmath54 and @xmath55 on a beam splitter with reflectivity @xmath82 and performing homodyne measurement on both modes afterwards ( i.e. , a projection on a infinitely squeezed single - mode state being improper eigenstates of the position operator ) . from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : tmss ] ) and ( [ eq : schurcomplement ] ) with @xmath83 and performing the limit @xmath32 , we can calculate the cm of the resulting state .",
    "it has the form of ( [ eq : tmss ] ) with @xmath84 we note that @xmath85 is symmetric in its arguments and fulfills @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "this means , arbitrarily faithful entanglement swapping is possible exactly in the limit of infinite entanglement .",
    "otherwise the entanglement necessarily deteriorates @xcite .    to show that this measurement is indeed optimal , we set @xmath88 where @xmath89 . calculating the resulting degree of entanglement , a direct and straightforward inspection reveals that @xmath90 can only decrease whenever we choose @xmath91 .",
    "we now turn to a one - dimensional gpeps , not allowing multiple bonds in the valence - bond construction , and are in the position to show the following observation :    [ the : oned ] let @xmath38 be a one - dimensional gpeps and @xmath43 and @xmath44 two sites .",
    "then @xmath92 where @xmath93 are constants",
    ". the best performance is reachable by passive optics and homodyning only .    in order to prove this",
    ", we interpret the preparation projection ( [ eq : prepmap ] ) and the following measurements of the localizable entanglement protocol as a sequence of instances of entanglement swapping .",
    "clearly , to allow for general gaussian projections is more general than ( i ) using the specific gaussian projection of the peps , followed by a ( ii ) suitable gaussian projection onto a single mode ; hence every bound shown for this setting will also give rise to a bound to the actual 1d gaussian chain . if @xmath94 is again the graph - theoretical distance between @xmath43 and @xmath44 we have to swap @xmath95 times . defining @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the initial strength of all bonds and iterating the argument we obtain @xmath98 as the negativity is up to a simple rescaling equal to this two - mode - squeezing parameter , the only task left is to show that @xmath99 decays exponentially . in order to do this , we need @xmath100 and the following relations which hold for @xmath101 : @xmath102 , @xmath103 . with the help of them , we can conclude that @xmath104 for a @xmath105 only depending on @xmath97 .",
    "thus , @xmath99 decays exponentially which proves observation @xmath106 .",
    "note that in order to maximize the entanglement between @xmath43 and @xmath44 , we have chosen the supremum of the maps better and better approximating the projection onto an infinitely entangled tmss .",
    "thus , for a specific gpeps which is characterized by a fixed map @xmath67 , the @xmath107 in generally lower .",
    "this result has a remarkable consequence for gaussian _ quantum repeaters lines _ : it is not possible to build a one - dimensional quantum repeater relying on gaussian states , if only local measurements and no distillation steps are being used .",
    "we will show in section [ sec : nogauss ] that even non - gaussian measurements can not improve the performance . if one sticks to the gaussian setting , also relying on complex networks does not remedy the exponential decay , as we will see .",
    "of course , non - gaussian distillation schemes can be used in order to realize cv quantum repeater networks .",
    "one should suspect that the exponential decay of @xmath49 is a special feature of the one - dimensional situation and that higher dimensional graphs would eventually allow to localize a constant amount of entanglement . in this section",
    "we will show that this is not the case .",
    "we first need a lemma which follows directly from our discussion of entanglement swapping .",
    "[ lem : nocolective ] let @xmath108 be a pure gaussian state on @xmath109 of @xmath110 modes and @xmath111 a pure gaussian @xmath112 state , where one part of each is held by @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "let the maximum two - mode squeezing parameter be @xmath57 between @xmath43 and @xmath44 and @xmath58 between @xmath44 and @xmath53 .",
    "then the maximum two - mode - squeezing parameter achievable with a gaussian projection in @xmath44 between @xmath43 and @xmath53 is @xmath59 .",

    "this is nothing but the gaussian version of the _",
    "schmidt decomposition_. it does hence not restrict generality to start from that situation . as noted above , the best strategy for entanglement - swapping between two pairs is a gaussian bell - measurement , where the squeezing parameter changes according to @xmath85 .    we will now allow for global gaussian operations on all subsystems belonging to @xmath44",
    "this situation we will relax to the following , where we allow for even more general operations : namely a local gaussian operation onto all modes of @xmath44 , as well as onto all modes of @xmath43 and @xmath53 that are not the two modes that share the largest @xmath36 .",
    "clearly , this is a more general map than is actually considered in the physical situation .",
    "this , however , is exactly the situation considered above , of an entanglement swapping scheme with an unentangled bystander .",
    "hence , we again find that to project each pair onto a two - mode pure gaussian state is optimal . for that , the sequence of projections better and better approximating infinitely squeezed tmss gives rise to the supremum .",
    "hence , we have shown the above result .",
    "now we can prove a central result of this work .",

    "again we consider the situation of having tmss distributed on the graph between vertices sharing an edge : a general local gaussian measurement on a gaussian peps ",
    "so the gaussian peps projection now on several modes , followed by a specific single - mode gaussian measurement can only be less general than a general collective gaussian measurement , so again we will arrive at a bound to the localizable entanglement in the gaussian peps .",

    "the input mode is measured in an arbitrary basis , where we also allow for probabilistic protocols , i.e. the operation does not have to succeed for all measurement outcomes",
    ". then one performs local gaussian measurements on each of the modes .",
    "then , at the end , one expects the mode at a single site @xmath44 to be in the state vector @xmath130 ( or at least arbitrarily close in trace norm ) for any chosen @xmath131 .",
    "note that the length of the computation , and , therefore , the position of the output mode @xmath44 , may vary and that the computational subspace can be left during the measurement .",
    "we want to stress that it is also possible to consider quantum wires which process qudits or even cv quantum information , where even on the logical level information is encoded continuously . however , the capability to process a qubit is clearly the weakest requirement .",

    "gaussian states defined on slabs of a finite width can not be used as perfect primitives for resources for measurement - based quantum computing , even if non - gaussian measurements are allowed for : any influence of local measurements will again exponentially decay with the distance .",
    "more specifically , we will first show that a one - dimensional gpeps can not constitute a quantum wire in the sense of the definition of subsection [ sus : mbqcgauss ] extended to arbitrary measurements .",
    "this already covers all kinds of sophisticated encodings that can be carried by a single quantum wire , including ideas of `` encoding qubits in oscillators '' @xcite .",
    "we will then discuss the situation when an entire cubic slab of constant width is being used to encode a single quantum logical degree of freedom , and still find that the fidelity of transport will still decay exponentially .",
    "not even using many modes and coupled quantum wires , possibly employing ideas of distillation , this obstacle can be overcome with local measurements alone .",
    "that is to say , we show that gaussian states can not be uplifted to serve as perfect universal resource states by measurements on finite slabs alone : frankly , the finite squeezing present in the initial resources  although the state being pure and known  has to be treated as a faulty state and some full machinery of _ fault tolerance _",
    "@xcite , which yet has to be developed for this kind of system , necessarily has to be applied even in the absence of errors .",

    "we will start by stating the main observation here : frankly , even under general non - gaussian measurements , transport along a 1d chain is not possible .",
    "we will refer both to the notions of localizable entanglement and the _ probability of transport _ : this is the average maximum probability to recover an unknown input state in a fixed subspace @xmath70 of dimension of at least @xmath137 which has been transported through the wire : specifically , one asks for the maximum average success probability of a povm applied to the output of the wire that leads to the identity channel up to a constant , where the average is taken with respect to all possible outcomes when performing local measurements when transporting along the wire .",
    "we will see that this probability will decay exponentially with the distance between the input and the output site .",

    "we define the operator @xmath154 and formulate the subsequent lemma :    ( a ) the network representing a single step of a sequential preparation of a gaussian mps , and ( b ) the tensor network representation of @xmath155 .",

    "the above observations [ the : generalgraph ] and [ the : onedhigherdim ] show that under mild conditions , gaussian cluster states _ not be used as _ or _ made almost perfect resources _ by local measurements alone .",
    "this constitutes a significant challenge for measurement - based quantum computing with gaussian cluster states , but does not rule our this possibility . in this subsection ,",
    "we briefly comment on ways that possibly allow to overcome the limitations identified here .",
    "clearly , it is very much conceivable that this observation may again be overcome by concatenated encoding in fault - tolerant schemes , effectively in slabs the width of which scales with the length of the computation : rather at the level of finite encodings , the resource can not be uplifted to a perfect resource .",
    "the situation encountered here  having pure gaussian states  has hence some similarity with _ noisy finite - dimensional cluster states _ built with _ imperfect operations _ @xcite . considering the preparation of the quantum wire and the transport by local measurements as a sequence of teleportations with",
    "not fully entangled resources , this means that every step adds a given amount of noise to the quantum information . in finite - dimensional schemes , if this noise corresponds to an error rate below the fault - tolerant a nested encoding with an error - correction code allows to perform computations .",
    "the size of the code grows polynomially with the size of the circuit one wishes to implement .",
    "in addition to this _ intrinsically _ error , any physical implementation will , of course , also suffer from _ experimental _ errors which must be also compensated by error - correction schemes .",
    "thus , the _ combined error _",
    "rate must be below the fault - tolerant threshold .",
    "it is therefore possible that once recognizing all finite squeezings as full quantum errors  which has to be done in the light of the results of the present work  and using suitable concatenated encodings over polynomially many slabs , that there exists a finite squeezing allowing for full universal quantum computation with eventual polynomial overhead .",
    "the question whether such schemes can be composed , or ones where suitable polynomially sized complex structures are `` pinched '' out of a large lattice",
    " that are universal remains a challenging interesting open question .",
    "one possible way forward in this direction to achieving a fully universal resource under local non - gaussian measurements would be to think of first performing local measurements at each site , aiming at filtering an imperfect qubit , @xmath219-cluster from a gaussian cluster state .",
    "ideally , one would arrive at the situation on , say , a cubic lattice of some dimension , where one can extract a _ graph state _ @xcite corresponding to having an edge between nearest neighbors with some finite probability .",
    "if this probability @xmath220 is sufficiently high  larger than the appropriate threshold for _ edge percolation_and if one can ensure suitable independence , an asymptotically perfect cluster on a renormalized lattice can be obtained @xcite .",
    "when trying to identify such percolation schemes , one does not have to rely on classical percolation schemes , but can also make use of more general repeater - type schemes of ref .",
    "@xcite , then referred to as _ quantum percolation _",
    "( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . to identify such maps ,",
    "either classical or quantum , yet , appears to be a very challenging task .",
    "one might also ask whether the tmss bonds as such can be transformed into suitable maximally entangled pairs of @xmath221 systems .",
    "this , however , clearly is the case . again applying a result for finite - dimensional systems to infinite dimensional ones by making use of appropriate nets of hilbert spaces",
    ", one finds that given a state vector @xmath80 of a tmss of some squeezing parameter @xmath222 , the transformation @xmath80 to @xmath223 is possible with a generalized local filtering on @xmath43 only , together with a suitable unitary in @xmath44 , with a probability of success of @xcite @xmath224 hence , whenever @xmath225 , this transformation can be done deterministically .",
    "this has interesting consequences for quantum repeaters .",
    "the protocol performing the transformation @xmath226 can be implemented by combining @xmath43 with an ancillary system @xmath53 , performing a joined unitary transform on @xmath227 , measuring @xmath53 and applying another unitary gate on @xmath44 classically conditioned on the measurement result .",
    "but even if @xmath228 one can still distill a resource from a collection of tmss distributed on a graph , performing an argument involving percolation here .",
    "this yet merely shows that gaussian states as such can be resources for information processing .",
    "most importantly , this is not the resource anticipated , so not the actual gpeps , but a collection of suitable tmss .",
    "then , non - gaussian peps projections can not be implemented with linear optics without an massive overhead .",
    "finally , an eventually created qubit cluster state would be obtained in _ single - rail _ representation where measurements in the superposition bases , which are needed for the actual computation , are experimentally very difficult and require additional photons .",
    "so the question of actual universality of the gaussian cluster state under all fair meaningful ways of defining a set of rules remains an interesting challenging question .",
    "we finally briefly reconsider the question of a quantum repeater setting based on general non - gaussian operations .",
    "above , we have shown that it is not possible to obtain a finitely entangled state for an arbitrary long one - dimensional gpeps . yet",
    ", what is also true at the same time is that a sequential repeater scheme based on sufficiently entangled tmss _ before _ the peps projection does yield a non - decaying entangled bond between the end points . that is , using only projective local measurements on each of the sites",
    ", one can transform a collection of distributed tmss in a 1d setting into a maximally entangled qubit pair shared between the end sites . in order to show this",
    ", it suffices to revisit the situation for three sites , as the general statement on @xmath0 sites follows immediately by iteration .",
    "now consider the quantum repeater setting and assume for simpli / city that we already have a qubit bell - pair @xmath229 which we want to swap through a tmss @xmath230 with @xmath225 .",
    "we can use the higher , unoccupied fock - levels of the state vector @xmath231 as an ancilla to transform @xmath230 according to eq.([eq : belltrafo ] ) . as the final unitary on @xmath53 after locc with one - way classical communication does not change the entanglement , we can as well omit it . as the unitary , the ancilla - measurement and the final bell - measurement on @xmath56 are equivalent to a single projective measurement on @xmath56 , it is possible to swap entanglement through an physical tmss perfectly .",
    "needless to say , this will be a highly non - gaussian complicated operation , and will not overcome the limitation of gaussian cluster states discussed above .",
    "in this article , we have have assessed the requirements to possible architectures when using gaussian states as resources for measurement - based quantum computing and for entanglement distribution by means of quantum repeater networks . using a framework of gaussian peps ,",
    "we have shown that under gaussian measurements only , the localizable entanglement decays exponentially with the distance on arbitrary graphs .",
    "this rules out the possibility to process or even transport quantum information with gaussian measurements only .",
    "the above results also show that gaussian cluster states  under mild conditions on the encoding of logical information in slabs , rather than having general encodings in the entire lattice  can not be used as or made perfect universal resources for measurement - based quantum computation .",
    "no information can be transmitted beyond a certain influence region , and hence , no arbitrarily long computation can be sustained .",
    "now , if one allows for larger energy , and hence larger two - mode squeezing , in the resource states , this influence region will become larger .",
    "in other words , small - scale implementations as proof - of - principle experimental realizations of such an idea will be entirely unaffected by this : any state with finite energy will constitute some approximation of the idealized improper state having infinite energy , and its outcomes in measurements will approximate the idealized ones . only that with this state",
    ", one could not go ahead with an arbitrarily long computation .",
    "this observation shows that gaussian cluster states are fine examples of states that eventually allow for the demonstration of the functioning of a continuous - variable quantum computer , possibly realized using the many modes available in a _ frequency comb _ @xcite .",
    "also , we have discussed the requirements for fault tolerance and quantum error correction for such schemes , yet to be established , in that any finite squeezings essentially have to be considered full errors in a concatenated encoding scheme .",
    "this work motivates such further studies of fault - tolerance of systems with a finite - dimensional logical encoding in infinite - dimensional systems .",
    "but it also strongly suggests that it could be a fruitful enterprise to further at alternative cv schemes , not directly involving gaussian states , but other relatively feasible classes of states , such as coherent superpositions of a few gaussian states like the so - called _ cat states _ , which have turned out to be very useful within another computation paradigm @xcite .",
    "we hope that this article can contribute to sharpen the needs that any architecture eventually needs to meet based on the interesting idea of doing quantum computing by performing local measurements on gaussian or non - gaussian states of light .",
    "we acknowledge interesting discussions with m.  christandl , s.  t.  flammia , d.  gross , p.  van loock , n.  menicucci , and t.  c.  ralph . this work has been supported by the eu ( compas , qap , qessence , minos ) and the euryi scheme .",
