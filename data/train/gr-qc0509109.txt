    "one of the gravitational wave ( gw ) sources targeted by the current generation of ground - based interferometric and resonant detectors is a stochastic gw background ( sgwb ) , produced by an unresolved superposition of signals of astrophysical or cosmological origin.@xcite direct measurements can be made of , or observational limits set on , a sgwb by looking for correlations in the outputs of a pair of gw detectors .",
    "the response of a pair of detectors to a sgwb depends in part on the observing geometry , in the form of the relative orientation and separation of the two detectors . if one or both of the detectors is a resonant bar detector , its orientation can conceivably be changed , thereby altering the observing geometry and the response of the cross - correlation experiment to a stochastic gw background .",
    "for example , the experimental setup of the allegro resonant bar detector @xcite allows for rotation of the detector .",
    "this produces a modulation of in the stochastic gw response which is used in the cross - correlation measurements being conducted between allegro and the interferometer ( ifo ) at the ligo livingston observatory ( llo).@xcite    in the case of llo and allegro , where the separation between the detectors ( about 40 km ) is small compared to the wavelength of gravitational waves to which both detectors are sensitive ( about 300 km ) , the azimuth dependence of the response is very nearly the same as for colocated detectors : sinusoidal with a period of @xmath1.@xcite .",
    "this work considers analytically the general dependence of the stochastic gravitational - wave response on the orientation of a bar detector , and applies the results to existing pairs of detectors .",
    "if a sgwb is isotropic , unpolarized , gaussian , and stationary , it is completely described by its power spectrum .",
    "it is conventional to express this spectrum in terms of the gw contribution to the cosmological parameter @xmath2 : @xmath3 if @xmath4 are the fourier transforms of the detector outputs , the correlation in the presence of a sgwb of spectrum @xmath5 should be@xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a geometrical factor @xcite involving the location and orientation of the two detectors , which we describe in detail in section  [ s : overlap ] .",
    "this factor also appears in the sensitivity of a standard cross - correlation technique@xcite , for example in the case of a background whose @xmath8 is constant over the frequency band of interest : @xmath9",
    "the factor @xmath7 appearing in and is typically ( see e.g. , @xcite ) defined as @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the positions of the two detectors , and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are their beam patterns .",
    "we follow the lead of @xcite by factoring the response tensors ( cf .  appendix  [ app : notat ] ) out of the integral and writing @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the unit vector pointing from one detector to the other , and @xmath17 by using the definition of the transverse , traceless projector in",
    ", we note that we can write @xmath18 note that this gives an alternate definition of the overlap reduction function which is manifestly independent of any polarization basis : @xmath19 written in the form , it is clear that @xmath20 is symmetric and traceless on both pairs of indices ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) . with @xmath23 as the only preferred direction , there are only three independent tensors which can be created with these properties :    @xmath24    ( previous derivations @xcite included two additional terms which were not traceless , the cofficients of which are of course zero . )",
    "the most general possible form is thus @xmath25 and hence @xmath26    the complete functional forms of the cofficients are derived in @xcite and corrected in @xcite , and a slightly simplified derivation appears in appendix  [ app : deriv ] of the present paper .",
    "first , however , it is elucidating to note the behavior at @xmath27 , which corresponds either to the low - frequency limit or to the case where the two detectors are co - located . in that case , becomes @xmath28 which is manifestly independent of the separation direction @xmath23 .",
    "that tells us that it can contain only the @xmath23-independent term @xmath29 .",
    "i.e. , @xmath30 , leaving @xmath31 it s easy to solve for @xmath32 by taking the trace of and using and to say @xmath33 this means that @xmath34 and @xmath35 note that this makes , for instance , the demonstration that the overlap reduction function for concident , coligned ifos with perpendicular arms is unity , extremely simple .",
    "[ just substitute in for both response tensors . ]",
    "in this section we consider in detail the form of the overlap reduction function between a bar detector with its long axis along the unit vector @xmath36 and    1 .",
    "an ifo with axes along the unit vectors @xmath37 and @xmath38 2 .   a bar detector with its long axis along the unit vector @xmath37 3 .   a general detector with response tensor @xmath39      the relatively simple form of @xmath40 makes it worthwhile to consider briefly the overlap reduction function in this limit , which can in general be written as @xmath41 and thus also applies to detectors located at the same site",
    ".      for correlations between an ifo and a bar , we use and and note that in this case @xmath42 is already traceless ,",
    "so @xmath43\\ ] ] for the case where the detectors lie in the same plane , the ifo s arms are perpendicular , and the bar makes an angle of @xmath44 with the ifo s `` x arm '' and @xmath45 with its `` y arm '' , so that    @xmath46    we have the familiar result that @xmath47      in the case of correlations between two bar detectors , the response tensors are    @xmath48    so that from @xmath49 where @xmath44 is the angle between the two bars , so that once again @xmath50 .",
    "note that the maximum value of , which occurs when @xmath51 , is @xmath52 , as opposed to the maximum of unity for correlations between an ifo and a bar or two ifos .",
    "for this reason , the overlap reduction function for two bars is sometimes ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) normalized with an additional factor of @xmath53 relative to so that the maximum at zero frequency is zero for any type of detector pair .",
    "the normalization used in this paper is preferred , however , for several reasons :    * including a detector - dependent normalization factor in the definition of @xmath7 would mean formulas like would have different forms for different types of detector pairs .",
    "* while the maximum value of @xmath40 for two bars is @xmath52 rather than 1 , its minimum value is @xmath54 rather than @xmath55 ( which is the minimum value for either two ifos or an ifo and a bar ) .",
    "so in all three cases the amplitude of the orientation - induced modulation is 1 .",
    "the latter point can be physically understood in terms of a bar detector being `` more omnidirectional '' than an ifo . for an ifo",
    ", there is one optimal propagation direction for which the gw response is a maximum , namely a wave propagating perpendicular to the ifo plane .",
    "two ifos with their arms parallel will both respond ideally to waves propagating in this direction .",
    "the same is true if we rotate one of the ifos @xmath56 , except that the complete correlation of the signals has become an anticorrelation , so @xmath57 . on the other hand",
    ", a bar detector has a one - parameter family of `` optimal '' propagation directions , all perpendicular to the bar .",
    "two parallel bars share the same family of optimal directions .",
    "however , if we rotate one bar @xmath56 , the planes perpendicular to the bars no longer concide , and there is only a single optimal propagation direction perpendicular to the bars for which they both respond optimally .",
    "so the anticorrelation in the perpendicular arrangement is not as efficient as the correlation in the parallel arrangement , and @xmath58 is smaller for perpendicular bars than for parallel ones .",
    "returning to consideration of the overlap reduction function @xmath7 for general frequencies and detector separations , what interests us here is the dependence of @xmath7 on the orientation of the bar .",
    "we assume that the locations of the two detectors and the geometry of the other detector are fixed .",
    "the one variable is the azimuth of the bar , which is conventionally defined as an angle measured clockwise from the local geographic north .",
    "if we define unit vectors @xmath59 and @xmath60 pointing north and east , respectively , the orientation vector for a bar with azimuth @xmath61 is @xmath62 its response tensor is @xmath63 where    @xmath64    this decomposition of the response tensor into a piece independent of the azimuth , plus pieces proportional to the sine and cosine of twice the azimuth , allows us to write the overlap reduction function as @xmath65 where @xmath66 given the location of a bar , it is relatively straightforward to work out the components in some convenient cartesian basis of the unit vectors @xmath59 and @xmath60 at the location of the bar , and thus construct the tensors @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 .",
    "those can be used , along with the information about the geometry of the other detector and the separation between the two detectors , to construct the cofficients @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 .",
    "one final improvement on the form is to define @xmath73 and @xmath74 according to    @xmath75    so that @xmath76 at a given frequency @xmath77 , @xmath70 is the orientation - independent piece of the overlap reduction function , @xmath73 is the amplitude of the orientation - dependent modulation , and @xmath74 is the orientation ( modulo @xmath78 ) for which the overlap reduction function is a maximum .",
    "note that this is not necessarily the _ optimal _ alignment for stochastic background observations ; if @xmath79 at the frequency of interest , the stochastic sensitivity is maximized by setting the azimuth to @xmath80 ( again modulo @xmath78 ) .",
    "this section contains several applications of to pairs of real - world detectors . in each case",
    "the ` detgeom ` suite of matlab routines @xcite was used to calculate the orientation - independent offset @xmath70 , the amplitude @xmath73 of the modulation and the azimuth @xmath74 of maximum overlap , as a function of frequency .",
