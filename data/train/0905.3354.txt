    "there are two main paradigms which have driven both the theory and implementation of quantum computation ; gate - based quantum computing ( gbqc )  @xcite , and measurement - based quantum computing ( mbqc )  @xcite .",
    "though these two models are computationally equivalent , in practice each has their own advantages and disadvantages which have major implications for the choice of physical system , design , and operation .",
    "we introduce a new paradigm called ancilla - driven quantum computing which combines features of both models , in order to parallelise the architecture of quantum computers , to decrease decoherence effects , and simplify their physical implementation and operation .",
    "gbqc requires , in general , arbitrary networks of dynamic operations which in turn complicates the design and characterisation of the entire computer .",
    "there are many scenarios where it would be desirable to physically separate preparation , measurement , and coherent interaction regions to reduce control complexity , circuitry congestion , and decoherence due to cross - talk .",
    "in contrast , mbqc performs computation purely through single - qubit measurement on a pre - existing static multi - partite entangled state , distilling and processing non - local correlation . however , the generation of the initial highly entangled state , incorporation of quantum error correction and fault - tolerance , and individual measurement of each qubit are issues in many candidate systems",
    ".    our new model of ancilla - driven quantum computing ( adqc ) is partly inspired by the previous works of andersson and oi in  @xcite , and also perdrix and jorrand in  @xcite .",
    "andersson and oi introduced an efficient method to implement any generalised quantum measurement by coupling the system with an ancilla qubit .",
    "the method , however , assumes arbitrary dynamic coupling operations between ancilla and system .",
    "perdrix and jorrand , on the other hand , describe a probabilistic version of mbqc in terms of a turing machine where one can view the read - write head as an ancillary qubit , though this is not the way the model is presented .",
    "moreover their approach still requires direct manipulation of the memory register and dynamic global measurement operators .",
    "adqc attempts to overcome such issues by performing computation where the memory register ( input data ) can only be remotely manipulated through interaction with a supply of prepared ancillas . in other words , instead of directly manipulating data qubits to perform universal quantum logic gates or measurements , adqc uses a fixed two - qubit unitary interaction to couple the memory register of a quantum computer to an ancilla qubit . by measuring the ancilla , the measurement - induced back - action on the system performs the desired logical operation .",
    "practically , a single fixed unitary interaction coupling the data and ancilla qubits greatly simplifies design , construction , and operation of the computer since only one particular discrete operation needs to be generated and characterised .",
    "furthermore , separating interaction and measurement leads to a parallel structure with possibly reduced decoherence @xcite .",
    "a requisite interaction for adqc already exists in a variety of physical systems ranging from ion micro - traps , neutral atoms , nuclear spin donors in semiconductors , squids and cavity qed which greatly increases the scope for implementation of the core ideas .",
    "adqc also naturally benefits from optimisation of the qubit species employed for memory and ancilla .",
    "memory qubits can be chosen for long coherence time at the expense of being static and difficult to manipulate directly , whilst ancilla qubits may be chosen for high mobility and rapid initialisation and measurement , e.g. donor nuclear spins in isotopically pure silicon as memory and electron spins conveyed via charge transport by adiabatic passage as ancilla in solid state quantum computing .",
    "so far we have mentioned only the practical advantages of our proposed architecture .",
    "the formalisation of the computational model underlying adqc , which is the focus of the current paper , leads to the introduction of a new multi - partite entanglement resource .",
    "only recently has it been demonstrated that a very restricted class of multi - partite entangled states are useful for universal mbqc  @xcite .",
    "however a full characterisation of such states  @xcite remains an open problem which this paper aims to make progress upon .",
    "the entangled graph states  @xcite have emerged as an elegant and powerful quantum resource , especially for measurement - based quantum computation ( mbqc )  @xcite .",
    "many important results on their entanglement properties  @xcite , information flow  @xcite , implementation  @xcite , and novel applications in cryptography  @xcite , are due to their simple description .",
    "the generating operator for graph states , called controlled - phase , is a symmetric and commuting operator which leads to a simple graphical notation and hence the name for these states .",
    "additionally , the elegant result by van den nest _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite shows that any stabiliser state is equivalent to a graph state up to local clifford operators .",
    "this greatly expands the scope of the results for graph states , and leads to a natural extension of the above constructions into stabiliser states , as well as allowing a convenient graphical notation for a very general class of states .",
    "if we consider _ open _ graph states , graph states where some nodes ( called input nodes ) are given in arbitrary states ( rather than being prepared in a particular fixed state which is the case for graph states ) much of the theory still follows .",
    "however open stabiliser states with arbitrary input nodes no longer fulfil the pre - requisites of the theorem by van den nest _",
    "al . _ , and in general they do not admit a trivial graphical notation .",
    "moreover , not all two - qubit interactions between system and ancillary qubits can be used for adqc . to characterise interactions that will eventually enable universal adqc we demand that the ancilla - system interaction leads to a unitary and stepwise deterministic evolution of the system qubit , and that it should be possible to standardise the computation , that is , applying all global operations at the beginning . by doing",
    "so we are able to place conditions on the possible interactions resulting in two classes of interactions that are necessary and sufficient for adqc .",
    "this naturally leads to the definition of a particular class of open stabiliser states , called _ twisted graph states _ which , despite being generated by non - commuting operations , still admits a simple graph representation .",
    "they form the key ingredient for adqc .",
    "we then show how this new class of states can be viewed as open graph states up to somelocal swap operations .",
    "we also develop an algebraic framework similar to the measurement calculus , which is the mathematical framework underlying mbqc computation .",
    "this makes it possible to derive the standardisation theory for the adqc patterns of computation .",
    "as we will see , any adqc computation requires a classical control structure to compensate for the probabilistic nature of the measurement . in order to characterise the determinism ,",
    "we introduce the notion of _ causal flow _ for twisted graph states based on the stabiliser formalism .",
    "compared to the open graph state , the stabiliser state has a more complicated and global structure .",
    "we construct , however , direct translations between adqc and mbqc for a subclass of deterministic patterns with flow which preserve depth , in order to prove that adqc is as parallel as mbqc .",
    "we also present the embedding between gbqc and adqc and show how , as for mbqc , a separation in depth can be obtained .",
    "we briefly review the required concepts from quantum computing .",
    "a more detailed introduction can be found in  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath0 denote a 2-dimensional complex vector space , equipped with the standard inner product .",
    "we pick an orthonormal basis for this space , label the two basis vectors @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and identify them with the vectors @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "qubit _ is a unit length vector in this space , and so can be expressed as a linear combination of the basis states : @xmath5 here @xmath6 are complex _ amplitudes _ , and @xmath7 .",
    "an _ @xmath8-qubit state _ is a unit vector in the @xmath8-fold tensor space @xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath10 basis states of this space are the @xmath8-fold tensor products of the states @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "we abbreviate @xmath11 to @xmath12 or @xmath13 . with these basis states ,",
    "an @xmath8-qubit state @xmath14 is a @xmath10-dimensional complex unit vector @xmath15 there exist quantum states that can not be written as the tensor product of other quantum states .",
    "such states are called _ entangled _ states ,   @xmath16 .",
    "we use @xmath17 to denote the conjugate transpose of the vector @xmath14 , and @xmath18 for the inner product between states @xmath14 and @xmath19 .",
    "these two states are _ orthogonal _ if @xmath20 .",
    "the _ norm _ of @xmath14 is @xmath21 .",
    "a quantum state can evolve by a unitary operation or by a measurement .",
    "transformation is a linear mapping that preserves the norm of the states .",
    "if we apply a unitary @xmath22 to a state @xmath14 , it evolves to @xmath23 .",
    "the _ pauli operators _ are a well - known set of unitary transformations for quantum computing : @xmath24 and the _ pauli group _ on @xmath25 qubits is generated by pauli operators .",
    "several other unitary transformations that we will use in this paper are the identity @xmath26 , the _ phase _ gate @xmath27 , of which @xmath28 and @xmath29 are a special cases , the hadamard @xmath30 , the controlled-@xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) and the swap operation :    @xmath33{lllllllllllllll }    \\mathbbm{1 } : = \\begin{pmatrix }   1 & 0 \\\\   0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix } , \\;\\;\\;\\ ; p(\\alpha ) : = \\begin{pmatrix }    1 & 0 \\\\    0 & e^{i\\alpha } \\end{pmatrix } , \\;\\;\\ ; h : = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 } } \\begin{pmatrix }    1 & 1 \\\\    1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix } , \\\\\\\\ \\ctr z : = \\begin{pmatrix }      1 & 0 & 0 & 0    \\\\      0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\      0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\      0 & 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix } , \\;\\;\\;\\ ; \\text{swap } : = \\begin{pmatrix }      1 & 0 & 0 & 0    \\\\      0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\      0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\      0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}. \\end{array}\\ ] ] the _ clifford group _ on @xmath25 qubits is generated by the matrices @xmath31 , @xmath30 , @xmath34 and @xmath32 , and is the normaliser of the pauli group .",
    "this set of matrices is not universal for quantum computation , but by adding any single - qubit gate not in the clifford group ( such as @xmath35 ) , we do get a set that is approximately universal for quantum computing @xcite .",
    "the most general measurement allowed by quantum mechanics is specified by a family of positive semi - definite operators @xmath36 , @xmath37 , subject to the condition that @xmath38 .",
    "a projective measurement is defined in the special case where the operators @xmath39 are projections .",
    "let @xmath14 be an @xmath8-qubit state and @xmath40 an orthonormal basis of the @xmath8-qubit space .",
    "a projective measurement of the state @xmath14 in the @xmath41 basis means that we apply the projection operators @xmath42 to @xmath14 .",
    "the resulting quantum state is @xmath43 with probability @xmath44 . an important class of projective measurements",
    "are pauli measurements ,  projections onto eigenstates of pauli operators .",
    "so far we have dealt with _",
    "pure _ quantum states .",
    "a more general representation with density matrices also allows us to describe open physical systems , where one can prepare a classical stochastic mixture of pure quantum states , called _ mixed _ quantum states . for a system in a pure state @xmath19 ,",
    "the density matrix is just the projection operator @xmath45 .",
    "suppose that we only know that a system is one of several possible states @xmath46 with probabilities @xmath47 respectively .",
    "we define the density matrix for such a state to be @xmath48 the most general physical operator that acts over density matrices is a completely positive trace preserving map ( cptp ) @xmath49 with kraus decomposition @xmath50 where the @xmath51 , @xmath52 is the banach space of bounded linear operators and we require that @xmath53    any unitary operation @xmath22 can be approximated with a circuit  @xmath54 , using gates from a fixed universal set of gates .",
    "the _ size _ of a circuit is the number of gates and its _ depth _ is the largest number of gates on any input - output path .",
    "equivalently , the depth is the number of layers that are required for the parallel execution of the circuit , where a qubit can be involved in at most one interaction per layer . in this paper",
    ", we adopt the model according to which at any given time - step , a single qubit can be involved in at most one interaction .",
    "this differs from the _ concurrency _ viewpoint , according to which all interactions for commuting operations can be done simultaneously .",
    "we give a brief introduction to measurement - based quantum computing ( mbqc )  @xcite .",
    "a more detailed description is available in  @xcite .",
    "our notation follows that of  @xcite . in mbqc",
    ", computations are represented as _ patterns _ , which are sequences of _ commands _ acting on the qubits in the pattern .",
    "these commands are of four types :    1 .",
    "@xmath55 is a one - qubit preparation command which prepares the auxiliary qubit  @xmath56 in state @xmath57 .",
    "the preparation commands can be implicit from the pattern : when not specified , all non - input qubits are prepared in the @xmath58 state .",
    "@xmath59 is a two - qubit entanglement command which applies the controlled-@xmath31 operation , @xmath32 , to qubits @xmath56 and @xmath60 .",
    "note that the @xmath32 operation is symmetric so that @xmath61 .",
    "also , @xmath62 commutes with  @xmath63 and thus the ordering of the entanglement commands in not important .",
    "3 .   @xmath64 is a one - qubit measurement on qubit  @xmath56 which depends on parameter @xmath65 called the _ angle of measurement_. @xmath64 is the orthogonal projection onto the states @xmath66 followed by a trace - out operator , since measurements are destructive .",
    "we denote the classical outcome of a measurement performed at qubit @xmath56 by @xmath67 .",
    "we take the specific convention that @xmath68 if the measurement outcome is  @xmath69 , and that  @xmath70 if the measurement outcome is  @xmath71 .",
    "outcomes can be summed together resulting in expressions of the form @xmath72 which are called _ signals _ , and where the summation is understood as being done modulo  @xmath73 .",
    "domain _ of a signal is the set of qubits on which it depends ( in this example , the domain of  @xmath8 is  @xmath74 ) .",
    "@xmath75 and @xmath76 are one - qubit pauli corrections which correspond to the application of the pauli @xmath77 and @xmath31 matrices , respectively , on qubit @xmath56 .    in order to obtain universality",
    ", we have to add a classical control mechanism , called _ feed - forward _ , which allows measurement angles and corrections to be dependent on the results of previous measurements  @xcite . let  @xmath8 and  @xmath25 be signals .",
    "dependent corrections are written as @xmath78 and @xmath79 and dependent measurements are written as @xmath80 .",
    "the meaning of dependencies for corrections is straightforward : @xmath81 ( no correction is applied ) , while @xmath82 and @xmath83 . in the case of dependent measurements ,",
    "the measurement angle depends on @xmath8 , @xmath25 and @xmath84 as follows : @xmath85 so that , depending on the parity of  @xmath8 and @xmath25 , one may have to modify the angle of measurement  @xmath84 to one of @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "these modifications correspond to conjugations of measurements under @xmath77 and @xmath31 : @xmath89 and we will therefore refer to them as the @xmath77- and @xmath31-actions , or alternatively as the @xmath77- and @xmath31-dependencies . since measurements are destructive , the above equations simplify to @xmath90 note that these two actions commute , since @xmath91 up to @xmath92 , and hence the order in which one applies them does not matter .",
    "a _ pattern _ is defined by the choice of a finite set @xmath93 of qubits , two not necessarily disjoint sets @xmath94 and @xmath95 determining the pattern inputs and outputs , and a finite sequence of commands acting on @xmath93 .",
    "we require that no command depend on an outcome not yet measured , that no command act on a qubit already measured , that a qubit be measured if and only if it is not an output qubit and that a qubit be prepared if and only if it is not an input qubit .",
    "this set of rules is known as the _ definiteness _ condition .",
    "a pattern is said to be in _ standard form _",
    "if all the preparation commands @xmath55 and entanglement operators @xmath59 appear first in its command sequence , followed by measurements and finally corrections . a pattern that is not in standard form",
    "is called a _",
    "wild pattern_. any wild pattern can be put in its unique standard form  @xcite ; this form can reveal implicit parallelism in the computation .",
    "the procedure of rewriting a pattern in its standard form is called _ standardisation_.",
    "this can be done by applying the following rewrite rules : the rewrite rules also contain the following _ free commutation rules _ which tell us that if we are dealing with disjoint sets of target qubits , then measurement , corrections and entanglement commands commute pairwise @xcite , so that @xmath96 where  @xmath97 represent the qubits acted upon by command  @xmath98 , and are distinct from  @xmath56 and  @xmath60 .",
    "standardisation allows us to graphically present the global operation of a pattern .",
    "we define an _ open graph state _",
    "@xmath99 to consist of an undirected graph @xmath100 together with two subsets of nodes @xmath74 and @xmath101 , called inputs and outputs .",

    "the mbqc pattern for controlled-@xmath224 ( @xmath225 with @xmath226 ) is , however , not desirable , as it is an operator between two qubits of the system rather than an interaction between system and ancilla qubits .",
    "therefore the natural choice instead is to consider the interaction @xmath227 .",
    "it is easy to check that this , combined with pauli @xmath31 measurement of the ancilla , will give us a simple generating pattern for the two qubit operator @xmath228 :    any unitary can then be simulated by sequential and parallel compositions of the above generating patterns , where the composition simply glues given patterns over the common system qubits , while preserving the initial orders of the commands .",
    "we will return to the important issue of how to represent the composed pattern graphically , but in order to do so , we first have to address the important feature of standardization in the adqc model .",
    "that is , the standardisation procedure which permits us to rewrite any well defined patterns , e.g. obtained from composition , in a standard form where all the preparation commands are applied first , followed by the entangling , measurement , and finally correction commands .    for simplicity , in the remainder of this paper we will restrict ourselves to a special class of patterns , namely , those using only ancillas of degree 1 with arbitrary @xmath206 plane measurement and of degree 2 with pauli @xmath31 measurement",
    "however , the whole theory developed in this paper can easily be extended to the more general setting .",
    "similar to the one - way model @xcite we present a simple calculus of local equations by which any general pattern can be put into a standard form where entanglement is done first , then measurements , then corrections .",
    "the consequences of the existence of such a procedure ( called standardisation ) are far - reaching and is explained in details in @xcite .",
    "we just recall that since entangling comes first , one never has to do `` on the fly '' entanglements and the rewriting of a pattern to standard form reveals parallelism in the pattern computation . in a general pattern , one is forced to compute sequentially and to strictly obey the command sequence , whereas , after standardization , the dependency structure is relaxed , resulting in lower computational depth complexity .",
    "it is known that any mbqc model can admit a standardisation procedure if and only if the entangling command belongs to the normaliser group of the group generated by the correction commands  @xcite .",
    "this is the case for our adqc model .",
    "the required rewrite rules are the rules for propagation of the correction through measurement are the same as for mbqc , but with additional rules for the @xmath208 measurement : we also have the same free commutation rewrite rules : @xmath229 where @xmath97 represent the qubits acted upon by command @xmath98 , and are distinct from @xmath56 and  @xmath60 .",
    "recall that the effect of a @xmath31 correction on a qubit @xmath135 simply flips the outcome of a measurement to be made on that qubit .",

    "we emphasise again that a key difference between adqc and mbqc is the interaction command @xmath232 versus @xmath233 .",
    "the explicit inclusion of the additional local hadamard operations , @xmath234 , is necessary for universality .",
    "this is due to the fact that no system qubit can be directly measured but instead any operation has to be implemented via the ancilla .",
    "it is apparent that while rotations in the @xmath235-basis can be performed with only @xmath236 , no _ basis change _ at the system can be implemented via the ancilla .",
    "as shown in section 2 , for any standard pattern in mbqc we can write its underlying open graph state with qubits representing the nodes and @xmath233 the edges of the graph . then , remarkably , only from the geometry of this graph we can obtain the dependency structures to guarantee a deterministic computation in mbqc .",
    "in other words , the simple graph representation for the global operation defining pattern allows one to determine dynamic properties directly from the static structure .",
    "can we still obtain similar properties for our new model ? despite the non - commutativity of @xmath237 the answer is yes . in section 5 we define the twisted graph state which is the underlying geometry of a given ancilla - driven pattern obtained from standardisation and we present how one can directly construct the dependency structure from their geometry .",
    "a central question in the theory of measurement - based quantum computing is the characterisation of the universal resources @xcite .",
    "unlike these studies that analyse the computational power of a uniform class of multi - partite entangled states , we take a `` bottom up '' approach and identify basic _ building blocks _ that can be composed to perform universal adqc .",
    "this requires the characterisation of all two - qubit interactions which couple any two ancilla and system qubits , while satisfying certain desirable conditions such as _ stepwise determinism , unitarity and standardisation _ that will lead to universality , in the ` universal state preparation ' sense @xcite .",
    "we obtain a full characterisation of universal resources for adqc for these conditions , while in contrast , such a general result is not available for mbqc .    in this paper we will focus on stepwise determinism , that is a pattern which is deterministic after performing each single measurement together with all the pauli corrections depending on the result of that measurement .",
    "other computation strategies could be considered that are not stepwise deterministic , such as the ( finitely ) repeated application of the same operation in the scheme @xcite .",
    "generalising adqc to adapt to these less restricted strategies remains an open problem .",
    "we introduce the canonical decomposition of two - qubit unitaries @xcite , @xmath238 where @xmath239 and @xmath240 are single qubit unitaries and the diagonal global operation is @xmath241 the vector @xmath242 characterizes all non - local properties of @xmath243 .",
    "it is sufficient to restrict the @xmath244 s to @xmath245 , and the set of distinct @xmath246 , up to symmetries , make up the so - called weyl chamber .",
    "the complete characterisation of two - qubit interactions that allow for universal adqc is summarised in the following theorem :    [ t - charach ] the global interactions , @xmath130 , between any two system and ancilla qubits which enable stepwise deterministic and unitary evolution that also admits standardisation procedure for universal adqc are locally equivalent to ( i.e. @xmath247 is of the form ) @xmath33{lllllllllllllll}\\ctr z ~~{\\rm and}~~ \\ctrzswap.\\end{array}\\ ] ]    note that , both @xmath32 and @xmath133 are among the so called `` maximally entangling '' operators , hence the importance of the above theorem is in the _ only if _ part which proves for the first time the necessity of this particular type of building blocks .",

    "<S> we introduce a new paradigm for quantum computing called ancilla - driven quantum computation ( adqc ) combines aspects of the quantum circuit  @xcite and the one - way model  @xcite to overcome challenging issues in building large - scale quantum computers . instead of directly manipulating each qubit to perform universal quantum logic gates or measurements , adqc uses a fixed two - qubit interaction to couple the memory register of a quantum computer to an ancilla qubit . by measuring the ancilla </S>",
    "<S> , the measurement - induced back - action on the system performs the desired logical operations .    by demanding that the ancilla - system qubit interaction should lead to unitary and stepwise deterministic evolution , and that it should be possible to standardise the computation , that is , applying all global operations at the beginning , we are able to place conditions on the interactions that can be used for adqc . </S>",
    "<S> we prove there are only two such classes of interactions characterised in terms of the non - local part of the interaction operator . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to the definition of a new entanglement resource called _ twisted graph states _ generated from non - commuting operators . </S>",
    "<S> the adqc model is formalised in an algebraic framework similar to the measurement calculus @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we present the notion of _ causal flow _ for twisted graph states , based on the stabiliser formalism , to characterise the determinism . </S>",
    "<S> finally we demonstrate compositional embedding between adqc and both the one - way and circuit models which will allow us to transfer recently developed theory and toolkits of measurement - based quantum computing directly into adqc .    </S>",
    "<S> models of quantum computation , multi - partite entanglement . </S>"
