    "metasurfaces are flat devices consisting of structured arrays of subwavelength apertures or scatterers that provide an abrupt change in electromagnetic properties as light propagates across the surface  @xcite",
    ". the properties of metasurfaces can be tuned by varying the parameters of the individual subwavelength elements to form a desired spatially varying response . this extraordinary freedom in design",
    "has been used to create devices that generate negative refraction  @xcite , light vortices  @xcite , flat lensing  @xcite , holograms  @xcite , and other unusual interface phenomena in both optical  @xcite and microwave  @xcite regimes .",

    "we set @xmath22 to be the polarizability of a `` virtual '' sphere centered at the focal point : the sphere has the same dielectric permittivity as the background material and can be made arbitrarily small ( e.g. , the diameter of a computational mesh unit ) .",

    "the enhanced resolution of our lens follows from the shaping of the near - field phase profile , which couples the incident wave to forbidden angles on interaction with material , rather than the near - field interference effects of near - field plates .",

    "<S> the solid immersion lens is a powerful optical tool that allows light entering material from air or vacuum to focus to a spot much smaller than the free - space wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> conventionally , however , they rely on semispherical topographies and are non - planar and bulky , which limits their integration in many applications . recently , </S>",
    "<S> there has been considerable interest in using planar structures , referred to as metasurfaces , to construct flat optical components for manipulating light in unusual ways . here , </S>",
    "<S> we propose and demonstrate the concept of a planar immersion lens based on metasurfaces . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting planar device , when placed near an interface between air and dielectric material , can focus electromagnetic radiation incident from air to a spot in material smaller than the free - space wavelength . as an experimental demonstration </S>",
    "<S> , we fabricate an ultrathin and flexible microwave lens and further show that it achieves wireless energy transfer in material mimicking biological tissue . </S>"
