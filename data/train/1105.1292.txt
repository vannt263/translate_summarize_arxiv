    "for gaussian shaped drive bunches in the linear regime ( where the bunch charge density is much lower than the plasma electron density ) , the maximum axial electric field is given by  @xcite @xmath4 with @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the incomplete gamma function , @xmath7 is the fundamental electric charge , @xmath8 is the number of particles in the driving bunch , @xmath9 is the rms length of the driving bunch , @xmath10 is the rms transverse size of the driving bunch in one dimension ( two transverse sizes are assumed equal ) , and @xmath11 is the plasma wavenumber determined by the plasma frequency @xmath12 and the driver velocity that is close to the light velocity @xmath13 . for a fixed bunch length @xmath9 ,",
    "the maximum of @xmath14 is given by @xmath15 .",
    "in our considerations ( modulation of a long bunch ) , @xmath9 for a microbunch is completely fixed by @xmath16 in such a way that that this condition is approximately satisfied .",
    "the function @xmath17 peaks at small @xmath18 and can be parametrized for @xmath19 to better than 10  % accuracy as @xmath20 we see from these formulae that small transverse sizes of the proton bunch are critical , as well as maximum plasma density .",
    "we determine the optimum conditions below .",
    "suppose we have @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the initial length of the proton bunch as it enters the plasma .",
    "under the right conditions , an instability will be quickly amplified resulting in microbunching of the long bunch .",
    "the number of e - foldings of the initial instability scales  @xcite as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the distance along the bunch in the co - moving frame in units of @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the ` time ' the bunch has traveled in the plasma in units @xmath27 . here",
    "@xmath28 @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the mass and relativistic factor of the driving bunch particles , and @xmath31 is the typical bunch density that , in the central part of the gaussian bunch , is @xmath32 note that this definition of @xmath26 differs from that in @xcite by the factor of @xmath33 .",
    "table  [ tab : parameters ] gives the value of @xmath27 taking the peak density for ps , sps and lhc bunch options .",
    "expression  ( [ eqn : foldings ] ) is applicable if @xmath26 is much greater than the e - folding time , which is not strictly applicable to our case , but the regime characterized by ( [ eqn : foldings ] ) is the one we want to reach . as seen from the table , we will need a very long plasma cell to reach large values of @xmath26 .",

    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ t3 ]            the field evolution for the stepped plasma profile is shown in fig.[f4-midterm ] in comparison with the uniform plasma case .",
    "the wakefield is preserved for a long distance , but however has a lower amplitude than in the uniform case .",
    "the latter follows from the fact that proton microbunches can create a wakefield over a long distance only if they are located in both the decelerating and the focusing phase of the wakefield , which is only one quarter of the wakefield period . in the uniform plasma ,",
    "the maximum of the field occurs when the microbunches fill the whole decelerating phase of the wave , which is nearly one half of the period .",
    "thus , the field amplitude for the long - lived microbunch train should be roughly half that of the peak field in the uniform plasma .",
    "simulations confirm this statement for all variants except lhc bunch .",
    "for the latter , the field of the long - lived train is substantially increased due to the plasma focusing of the microbunches with respect to their initial size .",
    "while most of microbunches in the long - lived train are well focused by the plasma wave , the head of the first microbunch is not and doubles in size transversely after a distance @xmath34 .",
    "once the first microbunch has diffracted away , the next will start to diffract , and this process is expected to continue until all microbunches are lost .",
    "the lower estimate for the scale over which , in the absence of external focusing , the whole bunch diffracts away , is @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the number of microbunches .",
    "values of @xmath37 and @xmath38 are given in table  [ t3 ] .",
    "however , simulations reveal that the field excitation is preserved over a much longer length [ fig.[f5-field](b , c ) ] suggesting that only a small fraction of a microbunch becomes unavailable for the wakefield excitation at each path segment of the length @xmath39 .",
    "the second possible limitation on the length of the strong wakefield excitation comes from the energy change of protons in the bunch . the simplest consideration of this effect , estimated by dividing the proton initial energy by the decelerating force , @xmath40 typically overestimates the length .",
    "the distances @xmath41 based on simulated values of @xmath42 ( table  [ t3 ] ) are much longer than the lengths over which the fields decrease in fig.[f5-field](a , b ) .",
    "a more careful investigation shows that the difference in energy depletion among the protons within a microbunch must be taken into account . for short proton bunches @xcite , the energy depletion results in an elongation of the bunch and thereby gradual decrease of the excited wakefield . for trains of microbunches , the mechanism is different , as illustrated by fig .",
    "[ f6-phase ] .",
    "the microbunches are initially located in such a way with respect to the wakefield that the microbunch head experiences the strongest deceleration .",
    "the induced energy chirp along the bunch results in bunch compression and a net shift of the bunch to the point of zero longitudinal field .",
    "when this occurs , the bunch stops changing its average energy and contributing to field excitation . when most of the bunches are in this situation , the wakefield drops down , and the bunches get lost transversely since the weaker wakefield can not keep the protons focused any more .    to estimate the energy change of a microbunch with distance",
    ", we assume a constant wave amplitude and consider the process in the reference frame moving with the phase speed of the wave @xmath43 .",
    "the wakefield @xmath44 and the on - axis potential @xmath45 in this frame are @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the on - axis field amplitude in the laboratory frame , @xmath48 is the wavenumber in the moving frame ,  @xmath49 , and the coordinate @xmath50 is measured from a zero field point . in the potential well ( [ e14 ] ) , a proton starting from the point of the strongest field ( @xmath51 ) gains a maximum kinetic energy ( in units of the rest energy ) of @xmath52 values of @xmath53 for @xmath54 are listed in table  [ t3 ] . for the first three variants , @xmath55 , and the motion of bunch particles in the moving frame is not relativistic .",
    "the frequency of particle oscillations near the bottom of the potential well is thus independent on the amplitude and equals @xmath56 simultaneous events separated in the laboratory frame by the distance @xmath57 ( i.e. , by the microbunch length ) differ in the moving frame by the time interval @xmath58 . for @xmath55",
    ", we can neglect this time difference and consider the bunch particles to start their motion simultaneously in the moving frame .",
    "consequently , after the time @xmath59 in the moving frame and the distance @xmath60 in the laboratory frame , a considerable fraction of the protons collect at the bottom of the potential well ( fig .",
    "[ f6-phase ] , @xmath61 m ) .",
    "this is the typical length scale over which the microbunch gives up the energy to the wave , if the bunch was initially located in the decelerating phase of the wakefield . to obtain the energy scale ,",
    "we lorentz transform the energy ( [ e15 ] ) and the corresponding momentum to yield the energy loss of protons @xmath62 for the lhc bunch ( @xmath63 ) , the above formulae are marginally correct , but still can be used as order - of - magnitude estimates .",
    "values of @xmath64 and @xmath65 are given in table  [ t3 ] .",
    "for the lhc case , @xmath66 , implying that the longitudinal shift of depleted particles is not a limiting factor .",
    "the real picture of wave - microbunch interactions is more complicated than that described in our simplified model , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ f6-phase ] .",
    "since the wave is created by the microbunches themselves , the cross - section of zero @xmath67 moves backward together with upstream microbunches , and compressed microbunches are formed in a decelerating field rather than at the point of zero acceleration . as a consequence ,",
    "the distance of strong field excitation is longer than @xmath64 ( fig .",
    "[ f5-field ] , top ) , the energy loss of protons is greater than @xmath65 ( fig .",
    "[ f5-field ] , bottom ) , and protons do not make a full circle on the longitudinal phase plane taking the energy back from the wave , but instead stick to the zero - field point and stop energy exchange with the wave ( fig .",
    "[ f6-phase ] ) .",
    "if test electrons of energy @xmath68 are injected into the wakefield , their energy gain ( fig.[f7-electrons ] ) is much lower than the energy gain of the most energetic protons for all variants except the lhc [ fig.[f5-field](d - f ) ] .",
    "the reason is the dephasing between electrons and the wakefield .",
    "the typical distance at which a fast electron outruns a proton with the relativistic factor @xmath69 by the half of the wakefield period ( and crosses the whole acceleration phase of the wave ) is @xmath70 to obtain the typical energy gain we multiply this distance by the average accelerating field : @xmath71 the resulting values are given in table  [ t3 ] .",
    "the parameters obtained in simulations are close to ( [ e19])([e20 ] ) . for the ps case ,",
    "electrons were injected into the wakefield several times at various stages of bunching [ fig.[f7-electrons](a ) ] , but for all groups the maximum electron energy is the same .    to obtain higher energy electrons from the ps or sps energy proton bunches , it would be necessary to achieve larger gradients .",
    "this would require larger drive bunch density , either through lower emittances or larger numbers of drive particles .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , proton interactions in the plasma are not a limiting factor . for typical values of @xmath72 in the range @xmath73  @xmath74 , the mean - free - path for inelastic reactions of high energy protons with the plasma are orders of magnitude larger than the simulated plasma cell lengths .",
    "the transverse growth rate of the proton bunch due to multiple scattering is also very small compared to other effects discussed here . for electrons ,",
    "the radiation lengths for the plasma densities of interest here are also very long compared to the lengths of the plasma cells under consideration , so that particle interactions in the plasma are not expected to be a limiting factor .",
    "we have investigated the wakefield amplitudes which could be achieved via the modulations of a long proton bunch .",
    "the key result in the parametric investigation is that , in the limit of long bunches compared to the plasma wavelength , the strength of the accelerating fields is directly proportional to the transverse particle density in the drive bunch , @xmath75 .",
    "this finding puts a premium on increasing this quantity for beams designed specifically for beam driven wakefield acceleration via the modulation technique .",
    "the scaling laws were tested and verified in detailed simulations using parameter sets for existing or planned proton bunches at cern ; i.e. , ps , sps and lhc bunch parameters . for existing bunch parameters , it was found that electric fields of about @xmath76  mev / m should be achievable for the ps , sps and lhc bunches , respectively .",
    "these gradients can not be maintained over arbitrarily long distances because the modulation process will eventually destroy also the microbunch structure . to overcome this deleterious effect",
    ", it has been shown that a density step in the plasma can freeze the microbunch structure , albeit at a penalty in the maximum achievable gradients .",
    "a detailed investigation of the evolution of the microbunches was undertaken for the setpped - up plasma density scenario .",
    "it was found that significant accelerating gradients could be maintained over long distances , although the resulting energy gains for electrons were moderate due to dephasing effects for the ps and sps cases .",
    "for the lhc , the protons are relativistic enough that dephasing is not a significant issue , and in this case test electrons were accelerated beyond @xmath1  tev with gradients approaching @xmath0  gev / m . it is anticipated that the achieved energy gains could be substantially more favorable if the transverse density of protons could be improved for all scenarios considered .",
