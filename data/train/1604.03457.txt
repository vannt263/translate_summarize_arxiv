    "long grbs are associated with the death of massive stars , creating collimated jets moving at relativistic speeds @xcite . in this scenario",
    "the radiation is so intense that it couples to the gas and the coupling contributes to the evolution of the system . in order , to study the evolution of this systems it is necessary to use models that consider the interaction between gas and radiation .",
    "the most solid theoretical model of grbs is the fireball model , where gamma - ray photons are generated via radiative processes such as : synchrotron and inverse compton radiation in internal or external shocks , for a review see @xcite .",
    "the internal shocks are associated to the generation of the prompt emission and the afterglow emission is associated to external shocks @xcite , although there is not a definitive model for the generation of grbs @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we instead explore the possibility that long grbs can be modeled with a single external shock , due to the fast propagation of a gas coupled to the radiation field .",
    "we do so by solving the equations of a relativistic gas coupled to radiation , which involves opacity and emissivity .",
    "this system is modeled with a relativistic radiation hydrodynamics ( rrh ) system of equations , explicitly , the system of relativistic euler plus boltzmann transport equation for photons that we solve numerically .",
    "the source of the emission is modeled using initial conditions for a single relativistic shock .",
    "our model involves two processes , namely the thermal radiation and bremsstranlung radiation with thomson scattering .",
    "the information that leads to these mechanisms is encoded the opacity , which is one of the free parameters of our model .",
    "these two processes are considered responsible for the non - thermal optical and x - ray emission , generated by a external shock when the jet is decelerated in the surrounding medium .",
    "the rrh system has been solved recently in various contexts . in @xcite a numerical code based on a moment formalism for radiation , under the eddington approximation ,",
    "is coupled to the mhd equations en general relativity . in @xcite",
    "the radiation rmhd equations are solved in a minkowski space - time as well . in @xcite",
    "the rrh system is solved on curved background space - times in order to study the accretion onto black holes . in @xcite",
    "the system is also solved for the accretion on black holes as well .",
    "an important condition in these models is that the opacity is restricted to be small , which eventually implies that the optical depth is also restricted to small values , because large optical depth the radiation moment equations become parabolic",
    ". therefore , two different time scales play during the integration when solving the rrh system . on the one hand the time scale used to evolve the system related to hydrodynamics can use explicit methods and on the other hand a time scale for the radiation , which would require implicit methods . this problem has been already solved for rrh , using the imex method , which is a combination of explicit and implicit time evolution methods .",
    "for instance , in @xcite and @xcite this method has been used to evolve accretion of gas onto a black hole using large optical depths .",
    "another ingredient in models solving the rrh equations is the radiation pressure model .",
    "for instance , in @xcite the eddington approximation is used , which is expected to be valid in the optically thick regime , whereas in @xcite the authors use the m1 pressure approximation , which is accurate in the optically thin regime . in the context of grbs ,",
    "considering axisymmetry , thermal and no thermal processes the system has been studied by @xcite .",
    "based on all these results , in this paper we use a 1d numerical code that solves the rrh system of equations in two regimes of optical depth , namely the optically - thick and the optically - thin using the m1 closure scheme .",
    "we show standard shock - tube tests in two different coupling regimes between radiation and matter , that is , matter - pressure dominated and radiation - pressure dominated scenarios .    as an initial contact with observations we construct the light curves due to various combinations of parameters of given initial conditions . for this",
    ", we consider initial conditions like those used to simulate relativistic jets .",
    "the jet is constructed with the injection of gas with a given velocity and mass density onto a fluid at rest , with radiation coupled to the fluid dynamics during the process .",
    "this model allows the construction of light curves which can be compared with the light curves of long grbs .",
    "we explore two different scenarios : 1 ) in the first scenario the jets are injected with a smaller density with respect to the surrounding medium , and 2 ) in the second , the surrounding medium has the same density as that of the injected matter . in both scenarios",
    "the density and pressure distributions in the sorrounding medium are given by a power law .",
    "we show a set of simulations with four free parameters : rest mass density , density of radiated energy , opacity and lorentz factor of the injected fluid . for each of the simulations we calculate the light curve and analyze the effects of each parameter in the shape of the light curve , peak height , width and tail . in this way we can estimate the values of the four free parameters that better fit observed grbs . as examples we present fittings of two particular cases of long grbs in the range of 15 - 150kev ( grb080413b and grb060904b ) .    the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the system of equations governing the dynamics of the fluid and the numerical methods used to solve it . in section 3",
    "we show the tests that validate our code . in section 4",
    "we present the results for many different initial conditions of the jet and the impact of the various parameters on the light curve .",
    "we also fit as examples two long grbs with our model . finally , in section 5 we present final comments and conclusions .",
    "the fluid is modeled as an ideal fluid immersed in the radiation field with a two terms stress - energy tensor @xmath0 .",
    "the first term is the stress energy tensor of a perfect fluid    @xmath1    where @xmath2 is the metric of the spacetime , @xmath3 is the four - velocity of fluid elements , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the rest - mass density , specific enthalpy , specific internal energy and the thermal pressure , respectively . the thermal pressure is related to @xmath4 and @xmath6 through a gamma - law equation of state ( eos ) @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the adiabatic index of the gas .",
    "the second term describes the radiation field and is given by    @xmath10    where the zeroth , first and second radiation moments are associated with the density of radiated energy @xmath11 , radiated flow @xmath12 and radiation pressure @xmath13 respectively .",
    "the interaction between the fluid and radiation field is given through the coefficients of absorption , emission and scattering of photons .",
    "these coefficients are given by @xcite    @xmath14    with @xmath15 is the coefficient of emissivity , @xmath16 is the coefficient of opacity and @xmath17 is the radiation four - force density .",
    "we assume an isotropic and coherent scattering , that is , the coefficients of thermal emissivity and opacity are related through kirchhoff s law .",
    "thus , the fluid and radiation fields are in local thermal equilibrium , and the opacity coefficients are independent of the frequency , and they obey the  gray - body \" approximation @xcite . under these conditions",
    "we can write @xmath18 in covariant form as    @xmath19    here @xmath20 , @xmath21 are the opacity coefficients , where the superscript @xmath22 and @xmath23 denote the thermal and scattering opacities respectively .",

    "the radiation field in the optically thin regime requires a more general assumption . a scheme that allows a description of the radiation field in both optically thick and thin regimes is the m1 @xcite .",
    "the m1 closure provides a better approximation than eddington to the radiation field , because it describes the diffusion limit , as well as the free - streaming limit where the radiative energy is transported at the speed of ligh , this closure is given by    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the reduced radiative flux and @xmath40 is the eddington factor @xcite .",
    "we can see that this closure relation recovers the two regimes of radiative transfer . in the optically thick regime @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 which corresponds to eddington approximation . on the other hand , in the optically thin regime @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and",
    "@xmath46 which corresponds to the free - streaming limit .",
    "the gas temperature is estimated from the ideal - gas eos via the expression @xmath47 , being @xmath48 the boltzmann constant , @xmath49 the mean molecular weight and @xmath50 the mass of proton .",
    "this is a good approximation when the fluid pressure is much greater than the radiation pressure .",
    "the temperature should be calculated taking into account contributions of both barions and radiation pressure .",
    "an approximate expression for the total pressure is written as    @xmath51    where @xmath52 is the total optical depth and @xmath53 the temperature of radiation @xcite .",
    "here @xmath54 depends on the temperature only if any of the opacity coefficients does . in general",
    "the eddington factor depends on the temperature @xmath55 .",
    "when the fluid and radiation are in local thermal equilibrium ( lte ) , that is @xmath56 , the temperature approximately obeys a fourth order equation similar to that above @xcite .",
    "the inversion of the radiation variables can be written as a set of algebraic equations that can be solved independently of the primitive hydrodynamic variables :    @xmath57,\\\\   f^x_r & = & \\frac{s_r}{w } - \\frac{4}{3}e_rwv_x - f^0_rv_x,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where    @xmath58.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with all these ingredients it only remains to solve the flux balance system for the variables ( [ eq : consvars ] ) .",
    "the advantage of writing the rrh equations in flux balance form , is that one can use use finite volume discretization in order to apply high - resolution shock capturing ( hrsc ) schemes and solve the evolution problem .",
    "radiation hydrodynamics equations are difficult to integrate numerically , because they present two different time scales , a long one related to hydrodynamics and a short one associated to radiation .",
    "using hrsc for the whole system has the disadvantage that radiation equations may develop instabilities .",
    "this becomes evident in the optically - thick regime ( diffusion limit ) , when the equations describing the radiation field transform from hyperbolic into parabolic , making the integration in time both inefficient and possibly unstable with an explicit method .",
    "one way to solve this problem is to combine implicit and explicit time integrations , using an explicit scheme for the hydro and an implicit one for the radiation @xcite .",
    "the combination of these two schemes has become the set of imex methods @xcite . in the present work we use the 2nd order imex runge - kutta which makes possible to explore larger optical depths than with an explicit rk @xcite .",
    "following this idea , we split the right hand sides of the evolution equations for the conservative quantities @xmath30 into two parts @xcite .",
    "the vector @xmath59 will be defined for the conserved hydrodynamical variables @xmath60 , and includes the respective source terms @xmath61 , whereas @xmath62 is defined for the radiation variables @xmath63 including @xmath64 which are the terms affected by stiffness . with this in mind , the imex scheme takes the form    @xmath65    whose general solution with @xmath23 intermediate steps reads    @xmath66    where @xmath67 are auxiliary intermediate values of the imex rk scheme and @xmath68 is the final full step solution .",
    "the order of the method depends on the coefficients @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the tilde coefficients are associated with the explicit part of the method , whereas those without tilde are related to the implicit part .",
    "the imex scheme in this paper is a hybrid between a second order accurate one step implicit rk gauss @xcite , and explicit midpoint rk that is also second order accurate .",
    "the coefficients that define the intermediate steps of this particular accuracy are given by @xcite    @xmath75    therefore , the construction of @xmath76 is explicitely    @xmath77,\\label{eq : implicitpart}\\\\ u^{n+1 } & = & u^n + dt[f(t^n + \\frac{1}{2}dt , u^ * ) +   \\nonumber\\\\          & & g(t^n + \\frac{1}{2}dt , u^*)].\\label{eq : explicitpart}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the implicit nature of the algorithm can be seen in the calculation of @xmath78 , which appears in both sides of ( [ eq : implicitpart ] ) .",
    "we solve for @xmath78 using a newton - raphson method . in order to show that the implementation of the above algorithm works properly , we present canonical tests in the following section .",
    "there is a series of tests of the perfect fluid plus radiation system that a code has to sort out in the eddington approximation @xcite .",
    "these tests are shock tube tests assuming various initial conditions shown in for instance @xcite .",

    "there is a significant difference between these models . in the first one ,",
    "we find that light curves for @xmath134 have the same morphology , that is , a single pulse followed by smooth decay , whereas for @xmath135 and @xmath136 we found that the light curves show the burst preceded by small pulses . in the second model",
    "we find three different morphologies : the first scenario with a single pulse , the second shows light curves that have one pulse followed by a knee and the third scenario is characterised by light curves with one or various pulses before the main pulse followed by a smooth although fast decay .    as a first contact with observations",
    ", we fit the light curves associated with two long grbs , grb080413b and grb060904b .",
    "the model that best fits the light curves uses an opacity emulating thomson scattering and bremsstrahlung radiation , which describes well the prompt emission , but is not enough to explain the afterglow .",
    "the best fits of the two grbs correspond to continuous fluid density @xmath110 at @xmath137 .",
    "the lorentz factor of the incident beam is @xmath138 for grb080413b and @xmath113 for grb060904b",
    ".    this model seems to do well at explaining the grb peak of luminosity curves , however it is not as good in the afterglow phase . in order to determine whether this single shock model can improve ,",
    "we will explore a wider sample of long grbs and various surrounding density profiles @xcite .",
    "we will also add multifrequency analysis similar as done in @xcite .",
