    "figure  [ magnetization ] shows the magnetization ( @xmath66 ) curves for crystal a @xcite and the polycrystalline sample @xcite at 1.4 k. the curve for crystal a shows the wide 1/3 magnetization plateau , while the curve for the polycrystalline sample shows the step - like increases at 25 and 46 t. the step at 25 t in the polycrystalline sample seems to correspond to the rapid increase toward the 1/3 magnetization plateau near 25 t in crystal a. the nmr spectrum contains two components at 30 t in the polycrystalline sample @xcite .",
    "one component has larger @xmath45 corresponding to the 1/3 plateau and smaller 1/@xmath50 ( pure component ) .",
    "the other component has smaller @xmath45 and larger 1/@xmath50 ( disorder component ) .",
    "the latter one has a broad gaussian - like shape , suggesting an inhomogeneous distribution of the internal field due to imperfection of the sample @xcite . because the disorder component is nearly absent in crystal a",
    ", the crystal must be of higher quality @xcite .      to further investigate the sample dependence , magnetization measurements on a bunch of crystal b with random orientations",
    "were performed @xcite . here ,",
    "crystals a and b with the different growth times of 1 month and 2 weeks have the different typical sizes of @xmath67 and @xmath68 mm@xmath69 , respectively . as shown in fig .",
    "[ magnetization ] , the curve of crystal b shows an intermediate behavior between curves of crystal a and the polycrystalline sample , indicating that crystal b contains the disorder component although the amount is smaller than that in the polycrystalline sample .",
    "this result indicates that the disorder component increases with decreasing the crystal size .",
    "imperfection of the crystal would be removed in large crystals ( crystal a ) due to the long growth time .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ magnetization ] , @xmath66 for crystal b approaches @xmath66 for crystal a near 50 t , implying that the disorder component also reaches the 1/3 plateau above 50 t. the step at 46 t observed in the polycrystalline sample might be attributed to the increase of @xmath66 of the disorder component toward the 1/3 plateau .",
    "however , the reason why @xmath66 for the polycrystalline sample exceeds the 1/3 of the saturated magnetization above 52 t is unclear at present .    because the magnetization measurements on crystal b were performed by using many small crystals , we can not distinguish two cases ; one case is that individual crystals show the same magnetization curve observed in the bunch of crystal b and the other case is that there are two types of crystals , that is , crystal a and polycrystalline types , in the bunch of crystal b. the nmr results on a single crystal of b below 15 t are slightly different from the results of crystal a as shown in the section b and c.

    "the high - field nmr and magnetization measurements on crystal a indicated two phases remarkably different from those in the polycrystalline sample ; one is the plateau ( p ) state above 28 t and the other is phase n at 23 - 26 t @xcite .",
    "p state and phase n are discussed in the main text . in this section ,",
    "we investigate the phase boundaries in the lower field region , where the difference between crystal a and the polycrystalline sample is not significant .",
    "figure  [ sp1 t ] shows the temperature dependence of the nmr spectra for crystal a at 1 t in @xmath26 plane . at 4.2 k , in the paramagnetic region , sharp peaks due to the quadrupole splitting",
    "are observed .",
    "the line width increases with decreasing @xmath29 and the distribution of @xmath45 masks the quadrupole splitting below 1.2 k. the spectra become independent of @xmath29 below 0.8 k. these results indicate an antiferromagnetic transition near 1 k , which is consistent with the results of the polycrystalline sample @xcite . the center of gravity shifts to higher values of @xmath45 below 1 k.",
    "this shift can be explained by internal fields perpendicular to the external magnetic field .",
    "for the three samples at 1 t. for crystal a and b , the magnetic field was applied perpendicular to the @xmath48 plane .",
    "the data of the polycrystalline sample is taken from ref .",

    "although the two - step transition is not clear in the temperature dependence of the nmr spectra , two anomalies are observed in the temperature dependence of 1/@xmath5 .",
    "figure  [ t1at1 t ] shows the temperature dependences of 1/@xmath5 for the three samples at 1 t. the inset shows the temperature dependences of the stretch exponent @xmath71 , which provides a measure of the inhomogeneous distribution of 1/@xmath5 . above 1.2 k ,",
    "the recovery curve can be fit to the single exponential function .",

    "1/@xmath5 for crystal b clearly shows a sharp peak at 0.8 k and a small shoulder at 1.2 k. the critical divergence at 0.8 k is consistent with the existence of the transverse ordered moments indicated by the shift of the center of gravity .",
    "the divergence behavior is in marked contrast to the behavior at 9 t shown in fig .",
    "3 of the main text .",
    "because the recovery curve for crystal a showed unusual oscillating behavior in the temperature range of 0.5 - 0.8 k , the value of 1/@xmath5 could not be determined in this range . at 0.5 - 0.8 k ,",
    "1/@xmath5 and 1/@xmath50 are expected to be very large , so that the nuclear magnetization was not sufficiently saturated by the comb pulse .",
    "in addition , heating effect should be significant due to short delay times for such large 1/@xmath5 .",
    "the insufficiency of the saturating comb pulse and heating effect might result in the unusual behavior of the recovery curve .",
    "figure  [ spfd ] shows the field dependence of the nmr spectra for crystal a at 0.3 t in @xmath26 plane .",
    "a single broad peak is observed below 4.4 t , while a double - horn - type line shape is observed above 4.7 t. the transition field from phase i to ii is estimated to be 4.5 @xmath56 0.2 t , consistent with the field of 4.5 @xmath56 0.5 t determined in the polycrystalline sample @xcite . even in crystal",
    "a , the transition shows a small width .",
    "such width is usually attributed to the coexistence region .",
    "however , the spectra near 4.5 t could not be reproduced simply by a sum of the spectra in phase i and ii .",
    "the phase boundaries between phase ii and the paramagnetic phase are not clear in the temperature dependence of 1/@xmath5 as shown in fig . 3 of the main text .",
    "therefore , we determined the boundaries from the temperature dependence of the line width .",
    "because the quadrupole satellite lines are broadened by powder averaging , the temperature dependence of the center line can be used to determine the transition temperature in polycrystalline samples @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , it is difficult to obtain the temperature dependence of the center line in single crystal measurements , because the center and quadrupole satellite lines overlap each other .",
    "therefore , we used the temperature dependence of the second moment @xmath72 obtained by      where @xmath74 is the center of gravity and @xmath75 is the nmr spectrum normalized as @xmath76 = 1 .",
    "figure  [ width ] shows the temperature dependence of @xmath77 for crystal a at various magnetic fields in @xmath26 plane .",
    "we can see that @xmath77 increase with decreasing temperature , although the transition is not sharp compared with the results of the center line for the polycrystalline sample @xcite .",
    "we determined the transition temperature by the cross point of the two linear lines fit to the data in the paramagnetic and ordered phases , respectively .",
    "for example , the two lines for the data at 12 t are shown in fig .",

    "the nmr results in phase ii slightly depend on the sample quality .",
    "figure  [ spii ] shows the @xmath51 dependences of the nmr spectra for the three samples . as shown in fig .",

    "[ spii](b ) , the same spectral shape is observed in crystal b , while 1/@xmath50 becomes much smaller .",
    "although the origin of the fluctuations is unclear at present , imperfection of crystals seems to suppress the fluctuations in the sdw sate .",
    "figure  [ spii](c ) shows the @xmath59 dependence of the nmr spectra for the polycrystalline sample @xcite . the dotted line is a powder pattern spectrum calculated by using the anisotropy of the hyperfine coupling in the paramagnetic phase , assuming that the width of the double - horn spectrum depends on this anisotropy in the paramagnetic phase",
    "this assumption is valid for the collinear sdw order , where the ordered moments are always parallel or antiparallel to the external field .",
    "the dotted line reproduces the characteristic features of the spectra after @xmath59 = 40 @xmath78s . in the polycrystalline sample ,",
    "the fast and slow decay components are observed and the former becomes negligible after @xmath59 = 40 @xmath78s @xcite .",
    "therefore , the slow decay component corresponds to the sdw order .",
    "the spin - echo decay rate for the slow decay component in the polycrystalline sample is close to that for crystal b. this fact is consistent with the expectation that crystal b is medium quality . in the polycrystalline sample , the fast decay component that vanishes until @xmath59 = 40 @xmath78s has a gaussian - like line shape @xcite .",
    "this component seems to be absent in the single crystals used in the nmr measurements , which show only the sdw component as shown in figs .",
    "[ spii](a ) and  [ spii](b ) .",
    "the gaussian - like line shape indicates that the fast decay component originates from imperfection of the polycrystalline sample and corresponds to the disorder component defined in section a. we further discuss the role of the disorder component in section f.    the calculated sdw spectrum in fig .",
    "[ spii](c ) is different from the sdw spectrum discussed in ref .",

    "3 of the main text . at 9 t , the recovery curve can be fit to the single exponential function above 2 k , while 1/@xmath5 shows a distribution below 2 k. the temperature dependences of @xmath41 at 18.6 - 24.1 t are quite similar to that at 9 t , indicating an appearance of internal fields below 2 k. these are consistent with the temperature dependences of the line widths shown in fig .",
    "[ width ] . above 28 t ,",
    "1/@xmath5 shows a distribution even at 4.2 k in the paramagnetic state . in general , effect of crystalline defects on 1/@xmath5 becomes significant in a gaped state .",
    "then , the strong external field might induce inhomogeneous @xmath45 near defects , which could provide inhomogeneity of 1/@xmath5 .",

    "the two components can also be seen in the recovery curve for the 1/@xmath5 measurements above 28 t. figure  [ recovery ] shows the recovery curve for crystal a at @xmath51 = 10 @xmath78s and 1.5 k at 28 t in @xmath26 plane .",
    "we can see the two components ; the intensity of one component is recovered within 10@xmath79 s , while the intensity of the other component is recovered near 10 s. the values of 1/@xmath5 in fig . 3 of the main text are obtained by fitting the slow decay component to the stretch exponential function as shown by the solid line in fig .  [ recovery ] .",
    "it is noted that in general spin diffusion effects might provide a fast relaxation component .",
    "however , the observed two components should correspond to the two distinct environments of internal fields , because they are affected by different @xmath45 as shown in fig .",
    "4(b ) of the main text .        in phase ii for the polycrystalline sample , @xmath45 of the disorder component has a gaussian - like distribution @xcite , while the other component is consistent with the sdw order as discussed in section c. the disorder component persisted even in phase iii for the polycrystalline sample , resulting in the sample dependence of the magnetization curves as discussed in section a. a previous study argued that a heterogeneous spin state consisting of two spatially alternating cu spin systems in the kagome layer is realized @xcite .",
    "there are two experimental results which support a heterogeneous spin state in the polycrystalline sample .",
    "one is the same number of the v sites for the two components , which indicates a microscopic superstructure .",
    "the other is the similar temperature dependences of 1/@xmath50 for the two components , which excludes a possibility of a macroscopic phase separation . in the previous study @xcite , a magnetic superstructure within the kagome layer",

    "<S> there is a possibility that 1/@xmath5 is dominated by three - magnon process rather than usual raman process @xcite . if three - magnon process is dominant in nuclear relaxation , a single magnon band provides a double value of @xmath57 due to an additional bose factor . </S>",
    "<S> however , the contribution of three - magnon process is one or two orders smaller than that of raman process in the present @xmath29-range owing to the larger gap . </S>",

    "<S> that is , a component corresponding to 40% of the intensity disappears until @xmath62s . </S>",
    "<S> the large difference of 1/@xmath50 between the two components can be attributed to the difference of the critical fields . </S>",
    "<S> the component with @xmath58 = 26 t has a large excitation gap at 28 t ( see the inset of fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the other component must have large 1/@xmath50 , because the gap is almost zero at its critical field @xmath63 = 28 t.    a possible origin of the two components is the two inequivalent layers [ fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the difference between @xmath58 and @xmath63 can be explained by the small difference in the exchange couplings for the two layers @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the fitting shown by the dotted line in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ spectra](a ) provides the ratio 1 : 1.6 , which may seem to be incompatible with the two layer scenario . </S>",
    "<S> however , the determination of the actual fraction requires removing the effects of 1/@xmath50 , because the values of 1/@xmath50 drastically change from phase n to p state as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ echodecay](a ) .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , it should be noted that each gaussian in phase n has a half width at half maximum of 0.02 t , which corresponds to 0.05 @xmath44 when scaled by @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> although an ideal spin - nematic state would not have such inhomogeneous moments , imperfection of a crystal might induce small moments in real compounds . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , if @xmath64-magnon bound states ( @xmath65 ) are condensed , a novel sdw state may produce such small internal fields . and the rapid increase of @xmath42 indicated by the dotted lines in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ spectra](b ) may indeed imply magnon bound states with large @xmath64 @xcite .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> the 1/@xmath5 results in p state indicate an excitation gap with a large effective @xmath6 factor , pointing to multi - magnon bound states . </S>",
    "<S> the anomalously large 1/@xmath5 and 1/@xmath50 values indicate unusual spin fluctuations with slow time scales in phase n. these results and careful examination of nmr spectra suggest that condensation of magnon bound states leads to a novel phase below the magnetization plateau .    </S>",
