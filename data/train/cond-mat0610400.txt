    "the thermodynamics of statistically interacting degrees of freedom is amenable to exact analysis under very general circumstances @xcite . a most remarkable link exists between the _ dynamical _ interaction in the form of a coupling term in the many - body hamiltonian and the _ statistical _ interaction in the form of a generalized pauli principle . for certain solvable models in @xmath4 one can replace the former by the latter and arrive at equivalent thermodynamic properties @xcite .",

    "notwithstanding the absence of an exact correspondence between dynamical and statistical interactions in @xmath9 , the exact thermodynamics of statistically interacting degrees of freedom has the potential of displaying a richness in phenomena unrivaled by mean - field theory or by perturbative approaches .",
    "most importantly , it incorporates a full and consistent account of fluctuations .",
