    "in the case , when the existing theory can not explain observed physical phenomena , a choice of an appropriate space - time geometry is the most effective and simplest method of solution of arising problems .",
    "the most reliable and doubtless conceptions of contemporary theoretical physics : the special relativity theory and the general relativity theory were created by means of a change of the space - time geometry .",
    "it is a common practice to consider the riemannian conception of geometry to be the most general conception of geometry .",
    "it is common practice to think that further development of usual geometry is impossible .",
    "to increase the geometry capacities , some authors tries to provide geometry by such unusual properties as stochasticity and noncommutativity .",
    "in reality the riemannian conception of geometry is not the most general conception of geometry .",
    "list of geometries , generated by the riemannian conception of geometry , is restricted by a series of unfounded constraints .",
    "imposition of these constraints was generated by a series of historical reasons and can not be justified .",
    "for instance , there is no necessity for introducing stochasticity in geometry .",
    "it is sufficient to eliminate some constraints , imposed on the riemannian geometry .",
    "after elimination of these constraints the motion of particles in such a space - time geometry becomes to be stochastic automatically @xcite , although the geometry in itself remains to be deterministic .    to understand this ,",
    "let us consider the problem , what is the geometry , in general , and the riemannian geometry , in particular .",
    "well known mathematician felix klein @xcite supposed that only such a construction on the point set is a geometry , where all points of the set have the same properties . for instance , felix klein insisted that euclidean geometry and lobachevsky geometry are geometries , whereas the riemannian geometries are not geometries at all .",
    "as a rule the riemannian geometries are not uniform , and their points have different properties . according to the felix klein opinion , they should be called as  riemannian topographies  or as  riemannian geographies  .",
    "it is hardly relevant now to discuss the question what is the correct name for the riemannian geometry , but it is very important to understand , why felix klein insisted on different names for the euclidean geometry and for the riemannian one .",
    "the fact is that one can formulate axiomatics ( system of axioms ) , determining the euclidean geometry as a self - sufficient construction , which does not need auxiliary means for its construction .",
    "there is no axiomatics for the riemannian geometry .",
    "first , it is very difficult ( technically complicated ) to construct axiomatics for each of possible riemannian geometries .",
    "second , there is no necessity in such axiomatics . in applications of the riemannian geometry to the space - time model only relations between the physical objects ( world lines of particles , vectors , etc . )",
    "are important .",
    "the geometry in itself is less interesting .",
    "all relations of the riemannian geometry are obtained as a result of modification ( deformation ) of corresponding euclidean relations .",
    "practically , this deformation is realized by a replacement of infinitesimal euclidean interval @xmath0,@xmath1const by the infinitesimal interval @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is a function of the point @xmath4 .",
    "such a replacement is a change of distances between the points of the space - time , what is a space - time deformation by definition .",
    "thus , the riemannian geometry is not a self - sufficient construction ( it has not its own axiomatics ) .",
    "the riemannian geometry is a deformed euclidean geometry .",
    "the riemannian deformation of the space - time , converting euclidean geometry to the riemannian one , form a class of deformations , restricted by a series of constraints .    in general , any deformation is described by a change of distances @xmath5 between all pairs of space points . in the case of the space - time this distance may be real ( timelike ) , or imaginary ( spacelike ) .",
    "it is more reasonable to use the quantity @xmath6 , known as world function @xcite . here",
    "@xmath7 is the distance between the points @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the world function is real always , and it is very convenient at description of geometry .",
    "the world function contains complete information on geometry .",
    "this property is the most remarkable property of the world function . in application to the euclidean geometry , as a special case of riemannian geometry , this property is formulated in the form of a theorem @xcite , which states that , if and only if the world function satisfies some euclideaness conditions , formulated in terms of the world function , the corresponding geometry is euclidean .",
    "these conditions will be written down , as soon as corresponding mathematical technique is developed .",
    "now it is important only that the euclideaness conditions contain references only to the world function and finite subspaces of the whole space .",
    "the dimension of the space , and all other parameters of the euclidean geometry are determined by the form of the world function .    in the case of euclidean geometry",
    "all information on geometry is contained in the world function .",
    "this property remains to be valid also , if the world function does not satisfy the euclideaness conditions and the geometry is not euclidean .",
    "then any choice of the world function @xmath10 corresponds to some geometry @xmath11 .",
    "this circumstance can be interpreted in the sense , that the world function @xmath10 describes deformation of the euclidean space , and any deformation @xmath10 corresponds to some geometry @xmath11 , which can be interpreted as a result of the euclidean geometry deformation .    from this viewpoint",
    "the riemannian geometry is a result of the euclidean geometry deformation , when the world function between the points @xmath4 and @xmath12 is determined by the relation @xmath13 where integration is produced along the shortest curve ( geodesic ) @xmath14 between the points @xmath4 and @xmath12 .",
    "the relation ( [ a1.2 ] ) describes the riemannian deformation of the euclidean space .",
    "this deformation is determined by the dimension @xmath15 of the space and by the metric tensor @xmath3 , which is a set of @xmath16 functions of one space point @xmath4 .",
    "information contained in these @xmath16 functions is much less , than information included in one function @xmath10 of two space points @xmath4 and @xmath12 . in other words ,",
    "the riemannian deformation is a deformation of a very special form .",
    "this raises the question .",
    "what are foundations for consideration of the riemannian deformation as the most general admissible deformation of the space - time ? why the riemannian geometry is the most general possible geometry of the space - time ?",
    "there are no reasonable foundations for pretention of the riemannian geometry to the role of the most general space - time geometry .",
    "consideration of the riemannian geometry as the unique possible space - time geometry is a delusion which should be rejected .",
    "the question what is the reason of this delusion is important and interesting .",
    "we shall not discuss it , restricting ourselves by the remark that this delusion is an associative delusion @xcite .",
    "in other words , it is a delusion of the same sort , which stimulated the scientific community to believe the ptolemaic doctrine for a long time . in other time",
    "( in the middle of xix century ) a delusion of the same sort stimulated rejection of the idea of non - euclidean geometry .    as soon as we assume that there are non - riemannian deformations of the euclidean geometry , generating more general geometries , than riemannian ones ( we shall refer to them as t - geometries ) , the simple and evident idea arises , that many properties of particles in the microcosm can be explained as specific properties of the microcosm geometry . in this connection",
    "it is relevant to mention that the special relativity theory has solved problems of motion with large velocities by means of simple change of the space - time geometry .",
    "the general relativity has solved problems of relativistic gravitation , changing the minkowski geometry by the most general riemannian geometry , connecting the form of geometry with the matter distribution in the space - time .",
    "description of nonrelativistic quantum effects can be obtained also by means a simple change of the space - time geometry @xcite .",
    "the arising space - time geometry depends explicitly on the quantum constant .",
    "the particle motion in such a geometry appears to be stochastic ( quantum mechanics principles are not mentioned at such a description of quantum effects ) .",
    "such an explanation of quantum effects differs from the conventional quantum - mechanical explanation by absence of any additional suppositions .",
    "one considers simply all possible geometries , generated by arbitrary deformations ( but not only riemannian ones ) of euclidean geometry .",
    "one chooses among these geometries the geometry which corresponds to the best advantage to the experimental data .",
    "as far as the world function as a function of two space points contains much more information , than the metric tensor components , the capacities of explanation of different effects , reserved in application of t - geometries as space - time geometries , appear to be much more , than other capacities of explanation , used now in the elementary particle theory and in the quantum field theory .",
    "one does not need to make additional suppositions on properties of physical phenomena in the microcosm .",
    "it is sufficient to consider all possible t - geometries and to choose this one , which agrees with experimental data .",
    "of course , the problem of choosing the appropriate geometry is not a simple problem , because for its solution one needs to study very large massive of data .",
    "but it is important that there is no necessity to invent anything .",
    "it is sufficient to investigate the existing data .    from viewpoint of common sense and logic",
    "the strategy of the microcosm investigation , based on the dominating role of geometry seems to be most encouraging .",
    "besides , this strategy appeared to be successful at construction of special relativity , general relativity and explanation of nonrelativistic quantum effects .",
    "idea of the geometry description in terms of only distance is a very old idea .",
    "there were attempts to carry out this program , using so called distance geometry @xcite , when some constraints , imposed on the metric of metrical space were removed . unfortunately",
    ", t - geometry has not been constructed , because external means of description ( in particular , concept of a curve ) were used . in previous papers",
    "@xcite one considered the symmetric t - geometry , i.e. t - geometry with symmetric world function @xmath17 .",
    "such a restriction on the world function @xmath18 seems to be usual and conventional . in the present paper one",
    "considers non - symmetric t - geometry , when the world function is asymmetric .",
    "asymmetric world function is associated with the situation , when the future and the past are not equivalent geometrically .",
    "one can not test experimentally , whether the future and the past are equivalent geometrically , because one can measure the time only from the past to the future .",
    "we do not insist that the future and the past are not equivalent geometrically .",
    "but investigation of geometrical description reserves , hidden in such an asymmetry , seems to be useful .",
    "the main constraints on the riemannian deformations are as follows : ( 1 ) fixed dimension , ( 2 ) continuity , ( 3 ) impossibility of deformation of one - dimensional curve into a surface , or into a point .",
    "these specific constraints are conditioned by application of a coordinate system at the description of euclidean and riemannian geometries . indeed , any coordinate system has fixed number of coordinates ( dimension ) .",
    "coordinates change continuously , and this property is attributed to geometry , because coordinates label the space points .",
    "finally , transformations of coordinates transform one - dimensional curve to one - dimensional curve , and this property of coordinate system is attributed to geometry in itself .",
    "there are methods of separation of geometric properties from the properties of the coordinate system .",
    "one considers description of geometry in all possible coordinate systems .",
    "the properties common for all these descriptions are properties of the considered geometry .",
    "but there are no coordinate transformations from @xmath15 coordinates to @xmath19 coordinates ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "there are no coordinate transformations , which transform one - dimensional curve to @xmath15-dimensional surface ( @xmath21 ) , and it is a common practice to attribute these properties of the coordinate systems to geometry in itself .",
    "thus , constraints on the means of description are attributed to the geometry in itself . to remove these constraints , generated by the means of description",
    ", one should remove all external means of descriptions and use the language , which uses only concepts which are attributes of the geometry in itself .",
    "it means that the geometry is to be described in terms of subspaces and world functions between points of these subspaces .",
    "practically a use of only finite subspaces of the whole space appears to be sufficient . as a result",
    "the description of geometry is carried out in terms of finite number of points and world function between pairs of them .",
    "such a description , which does not contain any external means of description , will be referred to as @xmath22-immanent description .",
    "the @xmath22-immanent description is convenient in the sense that it admits one to deal with geometry directly .",
    "one does not need to consider coordinate systems and group of their transformations .",
    "sometimes we shall use the coordinate description to connect @xmath22-immanent description with conventional description of geometry . but construction of t - geometry is produced in the @xmath22-immanent form .    in the second section",
    "the main statements of t - geometry are formulated .",
