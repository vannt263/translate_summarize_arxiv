    "the last year we have witnessed the impressive work of lhc , which has reached a luminosity that has allowed to test the standard model ( sm ) at extraordinary levels @xcite . in particular , lhc has provided notable bounds on the sm higgs boson mass @xcite . after the discovery of the top quark at fermilab tevatron collider , experimental attention has been turned on the examination of its production mechanisms and decay properties . within the sm ,",
    "the top quark production cross section is evaluated with an uncertainty of the order of @xmath6 , while it is assumed to decay to a @xmath7 boson and a @xmath8 quark almost @xmath9 of the time . with higher energy , as planned",
    ", the lhc will also become an amazing top factory , allowing to test the top properties , its couplings to sm channels and rare decays . because about @xmath10 top pairs will be produced per year",
    ", rare decays with b.r . of order @xmath11",
    "may be detectable , depending on the signal . for the @xmath7 boson coupling to fermion pairs ( @xmath12 ) ,",
    "the structure is proportional to the ckm element @xmath13 in the framework of the sm .",
    "therefore , the decay @xmath14 dominates its branching ratio .",
    "radiative corrections to this mode are of order @xmath15 and are difficult to detect at hadron collider , but may be at the reach of the international lineal collider ( ilc ) .",
    "top quark decays from flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) , such as @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , have been studied , both in the context of the sm and new physics . in the sm , the branching ratio of fcnc top decays is extremely suppressed .",
    "the rare top quark decay @xmath20 was calculated @xcite , the result implied a suppressed branching ratio , less than about @xmath21 , which was confirmed when subsequent analysis , included the correct top mass value , and gave @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "the decays @xmath23 and @xmath24 were also calculated @xcite,@xcite . the resulting branching ratios obtained there turned out to be @xmath25 and @xmath26",
    "the top - charm coupling with the sm higgs @xmath27 could be induced at one - loop level with a resulting branching ratio @xmath28 .",
    "the fcnc top decays involving a pair of vector bosons in the final state , @xmath29 , can also be of interest @xcite .",
    "although one could expect such modes to be even more suppressed than the ones with a single vector boson , the appearance of an intermediate scalar resonance , as in the previous case , could enhance the branching ratio .",
    "furthermore , it also seems possible to allow the tree - level decay @xmath30 , at least close to threshold , because of the large top quark mass @xcite .",
    "the top decay into the light quarks @xmath31 is suppressed , as they are proportional to @xmath32 @xcite . probably for this reason , the sm corrections to this mode",
    "have not been studied , though the qcd corrections should be the similar for both modes . however , it may be possible to get a large enhancement that could even make it detectable at the ilc in extensions of the sm .",
    "some typical results for the top decays in the sm are summarized in table i. this table also includes , for comparison , the results for top branching ratios from models beyond the sm , in particular from the thdm - iii @xcite and susy @xcite , which will be discussed in this work .",
    "another interesting mode is the decay @xmath33 , which could be mediated by a vector resonance . within the sm",
    "one could expect a @xmath34 .",
    "thus , this mode offers the possibility to test extensions of the sm that include an additional vector boson @xmath1 , which could have sm - like couplings to @xmath35 , but enhanced coupling @xmath36 . in this paper",
    ", we evaluate this decay mode within a particular extension that are well motivated and produce interesting signals . the so - called left - right symmetric model with non - universal extra gauge bosons , where there are strong constraints for transitions involving the 1st and 2nd generations , but admit larger effects for transitions involving the 3rd generation .",
    "we find that one can obtain @xmath37 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , the parametrization of the couplings of @xmath1 neutral gauge boson and evaluation the decay width for @xmath33 . in section 3 , the relevant details of the non - universal z model and evaluation of the corresponding @xmath38 .",
    "finally , our conclusions appear in section 4 .    .",
    "branching ratios for some ckm - suppressed and fcnc top quark decays in the sm and beyond , for @xmath39 gev .",
    "decays into a pair of massive gauge bosons include finite width effects of final state unstable particles @xcite , @xcite .",
