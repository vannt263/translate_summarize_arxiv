    ". it could be the case , that arbitrarily selected additional multicomponent associates provide better fitting to particular experimental data .",
    "one should recognise , however , that the price for the possibility to select the compositions of associates arbitrarily is the entropy paradox , which undermines the fundamental predictive capabilities of the model . in our opinion",
    ", the necessity of additional multicomponent associates for fitting the available experimental data indicates that the size of associates should be increased to incorporate the required compositions .",
    "in this paper , the modified associate formalism has been proposed for thermodynamic modelling of solutions .",
    "the presented approach is free from the entropy paradox and correctly reduces to the ideal solution model , where there are no gibbs free energy changes on forming associates of different types .",
    "asymptotic behaviour of chemical activities of solution components in binary dilute solutions has been investigated .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the derivative of the chemical activity of a solution component in its molar fraction at terminal composition has the expected value for any finite value of the gibbs free energies of formation of associates .",
