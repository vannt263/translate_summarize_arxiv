    "<S> we present a method of finding approximate analytical solutions for the spectra and eigenvectors of collective modes in a two - dimensional system of interacting bosons subjected to a linear external potential or the potential of a special form @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the chemical potential . </S>",
    "<S> the eigenvalue problem is solved analytically for an artificial model allowing the unbounded density of the particles . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra of collective modes are calculated numerically for the stripe , the rare density valley and the edge geometry and compared with the analytical results . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the energies of the modes localized at the rare density region and at the edge are well approximated by the analytical expressions . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in the systems under investigations at @xmath2 and find that in case of a finite number of the particles the regime of bec can be realized , whereas the condensate disappears in the thermodynamic limit . </S>"
