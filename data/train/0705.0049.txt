    "<S> a relativistic single particle model is used to calculate the inclusive @xmath0 reaction from @xmath112 , 40 , 56 , 197 , and 208 nuclei in the quasielastic region . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that this model provides a very good description of the available experimental cross sections when they are dominated by the quasielastic process . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we use this model to investigate the dependence of @xmath2-scaling on electron kinematics , particularly the electron scattering angle , for a range of squared four momentum transfer @xmath3 ( gev / c)@xmath4 . in this kinematic domain , coulomb distortion of the electron </S>",
    "<S> does not significantly affect scaling , but final state interactions of the knocked out nucleon do affect scaling particularly when the nucleons have lower energies . in general , we find that scaling works for this reaction , but at lower values of the four momentum transfer , the scaling function does have some dependence on the electron scattering angle . </S>",
    "<S> we also consider a modification of y - scaling to include small binding energy effects as a function of z and a and show that there is some improvement in scaling .    </S>",
    "<S> medium and high energy electron scattering has long been acknowledged as a useful tool to study nuclear structure and nuclear properties , especially in the quasielastic region where the process of knocking out nucleons is dominant . </S>",
    "<S> many experiments @xcite have been performed on medium and heavy nuclei at incident electron energies less than 1 gev where contributions of inelastic processes can be avoided . </S>",
    "<S> there are also a number of theoretical works @xcite which have been compared to the measured responses .    as we have noted before @xcite , the fermi gas model in the impulse approximation roughly describes the inclusive @xmath0 cross sections , but fails to provide a good description of the structure functions . a good theoretical description of quasielastic scattering requires two ingredients before one can compare experimental @xmath0 data from light to heavy nuclei to theory . </S>",
    "<S> one of them is a model for the nuclear transition current and the other is some provision for the inclusion of electron coulomb distortion effects for medium and heavy nuclei . in the early 1990 s , the ohio university group </S>",
    "<S> @xcite treated the electron coulomb distortion exactly for the reactions @xmath0 and @xmath5 in the quasielastic region using partial wave expansions of the electron wave functions in the distorted wave born approximation ( dwba ) . </S>",
    "<S> the madrid group @xcite subsequently reported a similar analysis for the exclusive @xmath5 reaction . </S>",
    "<S> however , the dwba calculations do not allow a separation of the cross section into a longitudinal part and a transverse part and are numerically challenging , and computational time increases rapidly with higher incident electron energies . in order to avoid these difficulties , kim and wright @xcite developed an approximate treatment of the electron coulomb distortion which does allow the separation of the cross section into a longitudinal part and a transverse part .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we found a model which provides a very good description of quasielastic scattering processes from nuclei for both the inclusive and exclusive cases . </S>",
    "<S> it is a relativistic single particle model which requires the wave functions of bound and continuum nucleons and a transition current operator . </S>",
    "<S> the bound state wave functions are obtained from solving the dirac equation in the presence of the strong vector and scalar potentials@xcite and for the inclusive @xmath0 reaction where the knocked out nucleons are not observed , the continuum wave functions are solutions to a real potential so as not to lose any flux . at low energies , </S>",
    "<S> this potential is just the same as the bound nucleon potential and thereby guarantees current conservation and gauge invariance . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is known from elastic proton scattering that the continuum potential becomes weaker with increasing proton energy . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , for higher energy processes we use a nucleon potential whose strength has been fitted to proton elastic scattering @xcite . in a recent paper @xcite , we found excellent agreement between our model with the higher energy experimental data from slac @xcite for the quasielastic @xmath0 scattering on @xmath6c , @xmath7fe , and @xmath8au at the squared four momentum transfer of approximately 0.20 - 0.30 ( gev / c)@xmath4 by using the energy - dependent real potentials ( which are weaker than the bound state potentials ) for the outgoing nucleons . </S>",
    "<S> note that these calculations do not conserve nucleon transition current , but we calculate all four components of the transition current in order to minimize errors due to lack of current conservation . </S>",
    "<S> note that the madrid group @xcite has used a very similar relativistic model for @xmath5 reactions . </S>",
    "<S> the excellent agreement of this model with experimental data allow us to use it as a tool for investigating @xmath2-scaling of the quasielastic components of the inclusive @xmath0 even in kinematic regions where inelastic contributions have large contributions .    since the pioneering work by west @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> there have been many experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite investigations of @xmath2-scaling from nuclei . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we propose to use our relativistic mean field single particle model with the inclusion of coulomb corrections to investigate the approach to @xmath2-scaling at intermediate values of the four momentum transfer . </S>",
    "<S> using @xmath2-scaling , the measured cross section for the inclusive @xmath0 reaction can be written as a product of the electron - nucleon cross section times a function @xmath9 which is related to the momentum distribution of nucleons in the nucleus and is a function of momentum transfer @xmath10 and energy transfer @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> for the case of large momentum transfer , the function @xmath9 should depend only on a single variable @xmath2 which is a function of @xmath11 and @xmath10 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> scaling is expected to be valid for the very large momentum transfer region , but it may be broken by final state interactions in the quasielastic region and/or electron coulomb distortion effects . </S>",
    "<S> a slac experiment @xcite was performed at the squared four momentum transfer @xmath12 of 0.23 - 2.52 ( gev / c)@xmath4 and the data at @xmath13 exhibited scaling at large @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> recently , there have been additional experimental data from jlab @xcite at 4.045 gev , but scaling of the quasielastic process can not be demonstrated since the energy transfer is sufficiently high that pion production is a significant contribution to the cross section . </S>",
    "<S> note that both of these experiments have been carried out at relatively forward electron scattering angles . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we can not compare our model predictions to these data since we have not yet included inelastic processes ( meson production , etc . ) in our model . </S>",
    "<S> however , as noted above we can use our model to investigate the scaling of the quasielastic contributions to the cross section .    using non - relativistic models , the authors in ref . @xcite </S>",
    "<S> analyzed @xmath2-scaling of the quasielastic electron scattering in few - body system , complex nuclei , and nuclear matter . within the framework of the plane wave impulse approximation ( pwia ) , they investigated the effects of the final state interaction , the binding correction , and the nucleon - nucleon correlations . </S>",
    "<S> they pointed out that the relation between the scaling function and the momentum distribution does not exist at finite momentum transfer because of the final state interaction and the binding correction . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , the madrid group in collaboration with donnelly @xcite have investigated scaling using a semi - relativistic model and note that the strong scalar and vector potentials in the final state of relativistic models result in a breakdown of scaling and result in different scaling functions for longitudinal and transverse responses .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we initially calculate @xmath2-scaling at the squared four momentum @xmath12 of approximately 0.2 - 0.3 ( gev / c)@xmath4 comparing with the experimental data measured at slac @xcite for @xmath6c , @xmath7fe , and @xmath8au , and bates @xcite for @xmath14ca , where the quasielastic contribution is kinematically isolated from pion production . </S>",
    "<S> we then investigate the effects of final state interactions in our relativistic model and electron coulomb distortion on scaling . </S>",
    "<S> since we are considering cases with large outgoing nucleon energies , we do use an energy dependent final state interaction . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we introduce a new @xmath2-scaling variable in order to solve the non - scaling problem in the presence of the final state interaction from different target nuclei in the same four momentum transfer range .    in the plane wave born approximation ( pwba ) , where the electron wave functions are described by the dirac plane waves , </S>",
    "<S> the cross section for the inclusive quasielastic @xmath0 reaction is written as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the squared four momentum transfer , @xmath17 $ ] is the mott cross section , and the longitudinal and transverse structure functions which depend on the three momentum transfer @xmath10 and the energy transfer @xmath11 are @xmath18 and @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> explicitly , the structure functions for a given bound state with angular momentum @xmath20 are given by @xmath21 with the outgoing nucleon density of states @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath23-axis is taken to be along the momentum transfer @xmath24 and the z - components of the angular momentum of the bound and continuum state nucleons are @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the fourier transform of the nuclear current @xmath27 is simply given by @xmath28 where @xmath27 denotes the nucleon transition current . </S>",
    "<S> the continuity equation could be used to eliminate the @xmath29-component ( @xmath30 ) via the equation @xmath31 if the current is conserved , but since we use an energy dependent final state interaction @xcite we violate current conservation and to minimize errors calculate @xmath30 directly . </S>",
    "<S> the nucleon transition current in the relativistic single particle model is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a free nucleon current operator , and @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the wave functions of the knocked out nucleon and the bound state , respectively . for a free nucleon , the operator comprises the dirac contribution and the contribution of an anomalous magnetic moment @xmath36 given by @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> the form factors @xmath38 and @xmath39 are related to the electric and magnetic sachs form factors given by @xmath40 and @xmath41 which are assumed to take the following standard form : @xmath42 where the standard value for @xmath43 is 0.71 ( gev / c)@xmath4 .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath2-scaling function is defined as the ratio of the measured cross section to the off - shell electron - nucleon cross section as follows : @xmath44^{1/2 } } } ,    \\label{fy}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) denotes the off - shell electron - proton(neutron ) cross section @xmath47 defined by ref . @xcite . in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fy ] ) , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the number of protons and neutrons , and @xmath50 is the mass of nucleon . the scaling variable @xmath2 @xcite is given by @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the mass of the target nucleus and @xmath53 is the mass of the ground state of the @xmath54 nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> the point @xmath55 corresponds approximately to the peak of the quasielastic scattering and @xmath13 ( @xmath56 ) corresponds to the small ( large ) @xmath11 region .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ pi ] , we calculate the @xmath2-scaling functions for @xmath6c , @xmath14ca , @xmath7fe , @xmath8au , and @xmath57pb by neglecting both the final state interaction of the exiting nucleons and the electron coulomb distortion . </S>",
    "<S> this is normally referred to as the plane wave impulse approximation ( pwia ) . </S>",
    "<S> the squared four momentum transfer is approximately 0.2 ( gev / c)@xmath4 @xmath58 0.3 ( gev / c)@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the scaling function for all of these cases as a function of the scaling variable @xmath2 are very similar  with deviations from the mean less than 10% which is probably due to binding energy effects . </S>",
    "<S> note from the caption that all of these examples were calculated with electron scattering angles of @xmath59 since , as we will show later , there is some breakdown of scaling at lower energies when the electron scattering angle is changed significantly .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ di ] , we show the same results as in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ pi ] , but with electron coulomb distortion turned on . </S>",
    "<S> we refer to this case as the distorted wave impulse approximation ( dwia ) . for heavier nuclei , electron coulomb distortion shifts the scaling curves toward the right side . </S>",
    "<S> however , the deviations from scaling due to coulomb distortions do not seem to be too large and the largest effect occurs for larger positive values of @xmath2 . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ dw ] , we show the same results as in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ pi ] , but with both the final state interaction and the electron coulomb distortion included .    </S>",
    "<S> clearly the final state interaction in this kinematic range leads to rather large violations of scaling which is also observed experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> for example , fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ slac ] shows the comparison of our theoretical results with the experimental data for @xmath6c , @xmath7fe , and @xmath8au measured at slac @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the incident electron energy is @xmath60 gev and the electron scattering angle is @xmath61 . under these kinematic conditions </S>",
    "<S> , the energy transfer is below the pion production peak ( except for large positive values of @xmath2)and hence the quasielastic peak is well separated from inelastic processes . </S>",
    "<S> note that our model , see also @xcite , describes the quasielastic process for all three nuclei quite well and furthermore , scaling is observed for the two heavier nuclei ( @xmath7fe and @xmath8au ) when the quasielastic process dominates ( @xmath62 ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , the lighter nucleus ( @xmath6c ) does not scale with the heavier ones . </S>",
    "<S> this deviation is due to a combination of electron coulomb distortion and final state interaction effects .    in order to improve scaling </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a modified scaling variable @xmath63 given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the average of the absolute binding energy for all the bound nucleons . </S>",
    "<S> this approach is meant to remove differences among nuclei including binding energy effects as suggested in ref . @xcite and may permit scaling for quasielastic scattering from different nuclei . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ avnz750 ] , we show the new scaling functions for @xmath57pb , @xmath8au , @xmath7fe , @xmath14ca , and @xmath6c at the same kinematics as fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ dw ] . comparing figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ dw ] and [ avnz750 ] clearly shows that @xmath63 improves scaling to some degree although some deviations from scaling remain .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ ca ] , we compare the scaling function to the experimental data measured at bates @xcite on @xmath14ca for three cases . </S>",
    "<S> the solid line and @xmath66 are for incident electron energy @xmath67 mev and scattering angle @xmath68 , the dotted line and @xmath69 for @xmath70 mev and @xmath71 , and the dashed line and @xmath72 represent @xmath73 mev and @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> the scaling functions have the same shape and the peaks lie at the same position , but the backward angle results ( dashed curve and @xmath72 ) have a different magnitude from the others . from these calculations , we see that scaling at these somewhat lower energies is affected by the electron scattering angle . </S>",
    "<S> this result is in agreement with the studies reported by caballero et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite that final state interactions affect longitudinal and transverse contributions differentially since changing the electron scattering angle changes the longitudinal and transverse contributions to the cross section . </S>",
    "<S> note that these calculations agree with the experimental data relatively well as in our previous results @xcite . in order to investigate the dependence of scaling at lower four momentum transfer values on @xmath75 , we calculated y - scaling with coulomb distortion and final state interactions for only the protons in @xmath57pb ( z=82 and n=0 ) as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ pipb - pro ] and for only neutrons ( z=0 and n=126 ) as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ pipb - neu ] . </S>",
    "<S> as expected , the scaling function for the proton only results show a much larger dependence on the scattering angle due to the changing representation of the longitudinal and transverse response . </S>",
    "<S> the neutron only scaling function contains much less longitudinal contributions ( due to the motion of the magnetic moment ) and varies less with electron scattering angle .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ highpb ] , we investigate scaling at larger values of the four momentum transfer as a function of electron scattering angle @xmath75 for quasielastic scattering on @xmath57pb when both coulomb distortion and final state interaction are included . based on this result and other cases </S>",
    "<S> we have examined , scaling is only weakly dependent on @xmath75 at these higher kinematic values although there is still some deviation at very large electron scattering angles . furthermore , as shown in fig.[avnz580 ] scaling for different nuclei still works well if all cases are calculated at the same backward scattering angle . clearly as the final state interaction decreases scaling </S>",
    "<S> improves . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ avnzhigh ] , we show the new scaling functions at high incident energy , @xmath76 gev , for the scattering angle @xmath77 in terms of @xmath63 as in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ avnz750 ] . clearly scaling is greatly improved even at this intermediate four momentum transfer region as long as we do not vary the electron scattering angles .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> we have investigated @xmath2-scaling of the inclusive @xmath0 reaction from @xmath78=12 , 20 , 56 , 197 , and 208 in the quasielastic region which is kinematically isolated from inelastic scattering . we use a realistic nuclear model describes the available data quite well and our calculations include electron coulomb distortion . as shown in figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ ca ] and [ highpb ] , the scaling function @xmath79 is not independent of electron scattering angle with particularly strong dependence at backward scattering angles for lower values of the four momentum transfer . </S>",
    "<S> however , we have demonstrated that if one restricts the variation of the electron scattering angles ( thereby not changing the longitudinal transverse mix significantly ) , scaling still holds at these lower kinematic values . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , as the energy increases , the dependence of scaling on electron scattering angles is greatly reduced . </S>",
    "<S> we also found that @xmath2-scaling breaks down at lower kinematic values due to the final state interaction . </S>",
    "<S> again , as the energy increases ( and the final state interaction weakens ) the breakdown of scaling is greatly reduced . </S>",
    "<S> we also used our model to investigate the different binding energy effects and final state interaction effects in different target nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> we do find some improvement in scaling by modifying the definition of the scaling variable @xmath2 to include binding effects . </S>",
    "<S> finally , electron coulomb distortion does disrupt scaling to some degree , but does not play a significant role .    in conclusion , we confirm that the final state interaction is the primary cause of the scaling violation in the quasielastic region for lower energies , but we find that scaling improves dramatically at larger four momentum transfer . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that at larger four momentum transfer values , scaling holds across a range of nuclei quite well . </S>",
    "<S> our model results , which agree very well with the available data , suggest that scaling can be used at larger four momentum transfer values to subtract out the quasielastic contributions to the @xmath0 cross section from nuclei so that inelastic contributions which contribute incoherently to the measured cross section can be investigated . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , our results suggests that as the energies increase the scaling function obtained from different nuclei and at different electron scattering energies differ at most by only 10 to 20 % . </S>"
