    "the importance of quantum criticality @xcite has been emphasized for a large variety of electronic materials , ranging from high - temperature - cuprate @xcite and iron - based @xcite - superconductors , heavy - fermion systems @xcite , to low - dimensional quantum magnets @xcite , tuned by chemical doping , high pressure , or intense magnetic field . in many of these systems both",
    "pressure ( or doping ) and magnetic field can destabilize a magnetically - ordered phase and lead to critical non - fermi liquid behaviors @xcite .",
    "however , the critical properties they induce are not necessarily equivalent .",
    "while pressure usually drives to a quantum phase transition between a magnetically - ordered state and a paramagnetic ( pm ) regime , a magnetic field leads to drastically - different effects caused by the polarization of the magnetic moments along the field direction .",
    "the comparison between the effects of magnetic field and pressure on quantum criticality has been scarcely explored so far , mainly due to the experimental challenges of such experiments under combined extreme conditions , to which one should add a third dimension , the temperature .",
    "for this purpose , heavy - fermion materials are ideal systems : they present the unique advantage of having low electronic energy scales , which allows their quantum critical properties to be tuned by experimentally - accessible pressures and fields . from now on we will focus on ce - based anisotropic heavy - fermion antiferromagnets , to which belongs cerh@xmath0si@xmath0 investigated here . in the following , we present the main features of their 3d magnetic phase diagram , drawn schematically in fig .",

    "well - defined anomalies ( for instance steps or kinks in the magnetic susceptibility @xmath8 , the heat capacity @xmath9 , and the electrical resistivity @xmath10 ) are the signature of the phase transitions at @xmath7 and @xmath4 . the onset of the cpm regime is a crossover and consists in a progressive change of the physical properties induced by low - temperature electronic correlations .",
    "strong intersite magnetic fluctuations are generally observed in the cpm regime of anisotropic heavy - fermion paramagnets , indicating the proximity of quantum magnetic instabilities @xcite .",
    "several characteristic temperatures ( instead of a unique critical temperature at a phase transition ) can be associated with this crossover to the cpm regime .",
    "its setting in leads to a broad maximum of @xmath8 at the temperature @xmath1 , below which @xmath8 almost saturates @xcite . at low temperature ,",
    "the relation @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the sommerfeld coefficient @xmath13 and @xmath9 is the specific heat , is verified , indicating a fermi liquid behavior associated with an effective mass @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the crossover to the cpm regime also leads to a broad maximum at the temperature @xmath15 in the electronic ( non - phononic ) contribution @xmath16 to the electrical resistivity , which is related with an inflexion point at a temperature @xmath17 in the resistivity @xcite . a similarity between the broad anomalies observed at @xmath1 in @xmath8 and at @xmath15 in @xmath16",
    "has been emphasized @xcite .",
    "a @xmath18 fermi - liquid variation of the resistivity , with a quadratic coefficient @xmath19 , is also generally observed at temperatures below @xmath20 @xcite .",

    "the prototypical heavy - fermion paramagnet ceru@xmath0si@xmath0 , where @xmath22  mk @xcite and @xmath23  k @xcite ) , are all linked to the crossover into the cpm regime .",
    "fermi - liquid behavior is not restricted to the cpm regime and can be observed inside the antiferromagnetic state . at @xmath4 ,",
    "@xmath20 passes through a minimum or vanishes , whereas the resistivity coefficient @xmath24 is maximal and may even show a divergence @xcite .",
    "driven by quantum criticality , i.e. , usually by critical magnetic fluctuations , heavy effective masses @xmath14 can reach up to a thousand times that of the free electrons @xcite . in many systems ,",
    "low - temperature superconductivity mediated by the critical magnetic fluctuations also develops below a temperature @xmath3 in the vicinity of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "interestingly , in several heavy - fermion antiferromagnets , a broad maximum of susceptibility is observed at a temperature @xmath1 higher than the nel temperature @xmath7 , indicating a cpm regime preceding the af ordering @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] at pressures just below @xmath4 ) .",
    "quantum criticality can also be reached by applying magnetic field , which destroys magnetic order and leads to a quantum phase transition to a polarized paramagnet ( ppm ) regime , above which a large part of the magnetic moments is aligned , at a critical field @xmath5 @xcite . in strongly - anisotropic heavy - fermion antiferromagnets",
    ", @xmath5 varies significantly with the field - direction and spin - flop transitions @xcite are forbidden .",
    "this contrasts with the case of isotropic or nearly - isotropic antiferromagnets , where @xmath5 is almost - independent of the field direction and where spin - flop transitions @xcite ( or crossovers controlled by a spin - flop - like domain alignment @xcite ) can be induced at low field .",
    "when the ising anisotropy is strong , a magnetic field applied along the easy axis induces a first - order metamagnetic transition at @xmath5 .",
    "well - defined anomalies are induced at the transition field @xmath5 in measured physical quantities , such as a jump in the magnetization driven by a sudden polarization of the moments along the field direction @xcite , or a sudden step in @xmath10 at low temperature , which is replaced by kink when the temperature is raised @xcite .",
    "similarly to the pressure effect , an enhancement of the resistivity coefficient @xmath24 and a vanishing of @xmath20 have been reported at @xmath5 @xcite . in anisotropic heavy - fermion paramagnets ,",
    "a magnetic field applied along the easy axis also leads to a ppm regime , at a pseudo - metamagnetic field usually noted @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "@xmath6 corresponds to a magnetic crossover and leads to broad anomalies in measured physical quantities , as a rounded step in @xmath10 at low - temperature , which transforms into a broad maximum when the temperature is raised @xcite .",
    "although they are both paramagnetic , the low - temperature cpm and ppm regimes may differ significantly .",
    "the cpm regime is characterized by strong electronic correlations and a small magnetic polarization under magnetic field , while the ppm regime is associated with a strong magnetic polarization and reduced intersite electronic correlations .",
    "this difference is highlighted in the prototypical heavy - fermion paramagnet ceru@xmath0si@xmath0 , where antiferromagnetic fluctuations are present in the cpm state but vanish in the ppm regime @xcite . under high fields ,",
    "a high - temperature scale @xmath2 also indicates the crossover from the low - temperature ppm regime to the high - temperature paramagnetic regime , being associated with a progressive loss of the field - induced magnetic polarization when the temperature is raised .    in the ising antiferromagnet cerh@xmath0si@xmath0 investigated here , the nel temperature @xmath7 of 36  k at ambient pressure , below which af moments are aligned along @xmath25 @xcite",

    "pressure- and magnetic - field - induced changes of the magnetic structure inside the af phase have also been reported @xcite .",
    "contrary to most other ce - systems where a non - fermi - liquid behavior is found , a low - temperature fermi - liquid @xmath18 dependence of the resistivity is reported in cerh@xmath0si@xmath0 at all pressures and magnetic fields @xcite , including at @xmath4 and @xmath5 where first - order transitions occur . although the superconducting ( sc ) , pm and/or af phases boundaries have been determined for several compounds in restricted pressure , field , and temperature windows @xcite , a full ( @xmath28,@xmath29,@xmath30 ) phase diagram , including the temperature and pressure evolution of the critical lines @xmath5 and @xmath6 , had not been established yet for a pure stoichiometric compound .",
    "here , we explore the complete three - dimensional ( @xmath28,@xmath29,@xmath30 ) phase diagram of cerh@xmath0si@xmath0 , and we extract its magnetic - field- and pressure - induced quantum critical properties . in particular , the need to consider carefully the high - temperature properties to understand the complex quantum critical properties in the ( @xmath28,@xmath29 ) plane , i.e. , at the borderlines between the af , cpm , and ppm quantum states , is emphasized .",
