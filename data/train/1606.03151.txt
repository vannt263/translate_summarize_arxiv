    "a number of well - established techniques exist for inferring plasma emission profiles based on line - of - sight measurements .",
    "the measurements are interpreted as line integrals of emission and are typically acquired in 1d or 2d arrays .",
    "this poses a question of `` inverting '' the acquired datasets into 2d or 3d maps , respectively , of plasma emissivity of the particle or wavelength of interest .",
    "tomography has succeeded at this in tokamaks @xcite and stellarators @xcite , primarily for x - ray and visible emission @xcite .",
    "tomography does not require knowledge of the flux surface geometry , although the geometry can constrain the tomography for better results .",
    "a disadvantage , though , is that it requires several cameras around the plasma .",
    "under the assumption of the flux surface geometry being perfectly known , a single camera is sufficient .",
    "if , additionally , the flux surfaces are axisymmetric , one can use the abel transform @xcite .",
    "this is appropriate in quiescent tokamak and spherical tokamak plasmas .    in stellarators",
    "it is reasonable to assume a good knowledge of the flux surfaces , which are nearly entirely determined by external currents and are magnetohydrodynamically more quiescent than in tokamaks and sperical tokamaks .",
    "this is especially true when the ratio of kinetic pressure to magnetic pressure , @xmath0 , is low : in that case , stellarator equilibria are easier to compute , faithful to experiments and magnetohydrodynamically stable .",
    "however , stellarator flux - surfaces are obviously not axisymmetric .",
    "the onion peeling algorithm @xcite can be considered a generalization of the abel inversion to non - axisymmetric problems .",
    "onion peeling is used here to invert wide - angle visible images of a stellarator plasma for the first time .",
    "the work was performed at the cnt stellarator @xcite and takes advantage of a recent experimental and numerical study of its field errors @xcite , giving good confidence in the knowledge of its flux surfaces .",
    "the method is described in sec.[sec : met ] .",
    "sec.[sec : fwd ] is devoted to the `` forward problem '' : toy models of the emissivity profile are translated in the corresponding images expected to be acquired by the camera .",
    "the synthetic image corresponding to an edge - peaked profile is in best qualitative agreement with the actual experimental images .",
    "the inverse problem is solved in sec.[sec : expres ] .",
    "the method is first tested with a glow discharge plasma for validation and then applied to a microwave - heated plasma .",
    "the method used in this paper for reconstructing the emissivity profile relies on two principal assumptions .",
    "the first is that the plasma can be modeled as a set of nested discrete layers , each of which has a uniform emissivity . in the context of a toroidal magnetic confinement device ,",
    "these layers are bounded by flux surfaces ( fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] ) .",
    "the second assumption is that the emissive layers contribute to the brightness of each camera pixel in proportion to the distance that the pixel s line - of - sight travels through each layer .    with these assumptions in place , the brightness @xmath1 of each pixel is related to the emissivity of each layer by a system of linear equations ,    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is brightness of the @xmath4 pixel",
    ", @xmath5 is a constant of proportionality , @xmath6 is the total distance traveled by the @xmath4 pixel s line - of - sight throught the @xmath7 layer , and @xmath8 is the emissivity of the @xmath7 layer .",
    "the elements of the matrix @xmath9 can be calculated based on knowledge of ( 1 ) the flux surfaces , ( 2 ) the camera s position , orientation , and field of view , and ( 3 ) the positions of any obstacles ( such as cnt s in - vessel coils ) obstructing the camera s view of portions of the plasma . for the low-@xmath0 plasmas studied in cnt for this work , any differences from the measured vacuum flux surfaces were neglected .     and @xmath10 .",
    "the lines - of - sight both travel through one or more layers of plasma , whose borders are shown as alternating blue and white surfaces .",
    "the lengths of the segments within the respective surfaces constitute the components of the @xmath9 matrix as defined in the text .",
    "note that some components ( like @xmath11 here ) are actually due to the sum of two or more segments due to multiple crossings of a layer .",
    "the terms @xmath12 are the emissivities of each layer.,scaledwidth=32.0% ]    the pixel data tends to be noisy and can exhibit nontrivial correlations .",
    "hence , if one is to reconstruct the emissivity profile based on pixel data , it is best to have many more pixels than layers to reconstruct .",
    "an unbiased estimator of the emissivity profile can then be expressed as@xcite    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the covariance matrix for the pixel noise .    when the emissivity profile @xmath15 is calculated in this way , it is informative to plug it back into eq .",
    "[ eqn : fwd ] to synthesize an image @xmath16 for comparison with the original image .",
    "as an initial proof - of - concept and a test of the reliability of the calculations of @xmath9 , synthetic images were generated based on profiles that were specified _",
    "a priori_. @xmath9 was calculated to correspond to a camera view similar to that of the photograph shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : argonphoto ] .",
    "the test profiles were given three basic functional forms : hollow ( linearly increasing from core to edge ) , uniform , and peaked ( linearly decreasing from core to edge ) .",
    "these profiles and the resulting synthetic images are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : forwardproblem ] . of the three test profiles , the hollow one ( fig .",
    "[ fig : forwardproblem]b ) has the best qualitative agreement with the photograph in fig .",
    "[ fig : argonphoto ] , suggesting that the plasma in the photo ( which is typical of the @xmath17 electron cyclotron resonant heating ( ecrh ) discharges studied in cnt ) has greater visible emission at the edge than in the core .",
    "this is consistent with a higher rate of recombination reactions occurring in the colder edge .",
    "images used for profile reconstructions were acquired by a high - speed cmos camera manufactured by canadian photonics .",
    "the camera was placed outside the vacuum chamber with a view through a fused silica window .",
    "the field of view is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bboxes ] . as eq .",
    "[ eqn : fwd ] does not account for external sources of light , sheets of low - outgassing black foil manufactured by acktar were fixed to the internal vessel walls to prevent reflection in the camera s lines - of - sight .    to account for pixel noise ,",
    "a large number of frames ( greater than or equal to the total number of pixels to be analyzed ) was acquired with no light sources present .",
    "the mean value of the noise acquired for each pixel was then subtracted from the corresponding pixel in a plasma image .",
    "the result of this subtraction is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bboxes]b .",
    "the background frames were also used to compute the pixel noise covariance matrix @xmath14 for the inversion ( eq .  [ eqn : inv ] ) . optical noise originating from the chamber was neglected .",
    "the propagated error @xmath18 for the @xmath7 layer in the profile was calculated as the square root of the @xmath7 diagonal element of the posterior covariance matrix@xcite , given by @xmath19 .    for each plasma image ,",
    "ten independent inversions were conducted using disjoint subsets of the pixels ( shown as blue boxes in fig .",
    "[ fig : bboxes]b ) .",
    "the subsets used in this work contained between 560 and 860 pixels . to be included in a subset , a pixel s line - of - sight needed to terminate against black foil",
    "the ten different profiles @xmath15 obtained from each of the subsets were then averaged to obtain a final reconstructed profile .",
    "this was done to partially cancel the effects of small errors in the camera alignment , which would otherwise cause some contributions to some pixels to be misattributed to layers not within their lines - of - sight .",
    "the standard deviation among these measurements will be notated as @xmath20 .",
    "the total uncertainty of the emission from the @xmath7 layer was then computed from the quadrature sum of the alignment error @xmath20 and the noise error @xmath21 averaged over @xmath22 pixel subsets :    @xmath23      b ) .",
    "( d)-(e ) image and reconstruction for the 5.7 cm filament position.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    field line and flux surface visualizations are often utilized in cnt for diagnostic alignment .",
    "@xcite these are discharges maintained by a heated , biased filament .",
    "they tend to emit a visible glow that is localized to the flux surface where the filament is located . in the case of rational or near - rational surfaces ,",
    "the glow is restricted to the flux tube connecting one side of the filament to the other . on non - rational surfaces",
    ", however , the entire surface tends to be emissive .    while this glow is not perfectly uniform , it is nonetheless expected that an inversion of such a glow would result in an emission profile that is peaked around the layer where the emitter is located .",
    "hence , inversions of glow discharges can serve as tests of the method s validity .",
    "quiescent glow discharges were filmed at 25 frames per second with 15 ms exposures at the camera s lowest gain setting .",
    "[ fig : reconstr_glow]a shows emissivity profiles from glow discharges from several filament locations at successively larger effective minor radii . as expected , each profile is peaked .",
    "additionally , the peak locations agree well with the locations of the filament , which were measured independently through field line mapping procedures similar to those described in refs .",
    "glow discharges on surfaces with larger minor radii tend to have lower calculated emissivity overall ; this is consistent with visual inspection of the discharges .",
    "[ fig : reconstr_glow]b - e show raw and reconstructed images corresponding to two of the profiles from fig .",
    "[ fig : reconstr_glow]a . while the agreement is qualitatively good in many respects , there are some features from the photos that are not replicated in the reconstructions .",
    "perhaps the most noticeable are the bright , narrow streaks that are visible in the middle of the plasmas in the center and left of figs .  [",
    "fig : reconstr_glow]b , d .",
    "the streak is a nonuniformity on its surface ( even on non - rational surfaces , regions with short connection lengths to the filament tend to glow brigher than the rest of the surface ) .",
    "such a nonuniformity is not expected to carry over in the inversion process , due to the assumption of uniform emissivity within a layer discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : met ] .",
    "1 kw ecrh discharges lasting for roughly 7 ms were filmed at 500 frames per second with 2 ms exposures at the lowest gain setting .",
    "[ fig : reconstr_uwave ] shows a profile , image data , and reconstructed image from a typical frame .",
    "note that , except for the outermost layer , the profile follows a roughly linear trend similar to the hollow test profile in fig .",
    "[ fig : forwardproblem ] .",
    "in contrast to the image comparisons from fig .  [",
    "fig : reconstr_glow ] , in which the image data had fine structure that did not appear in the reconstructions , the reconstruction for the ecrh discharge in fig .",
    "[ fig : reconstr_uwave]c has fine structure that is not visible in the image data ( fig .",
    "[ fig : reconstr_uwave]b ) .",
    "much of the structure in the reconstruction results from the jump in emissivity at the edge as seen in the profile , which would result in bright spots wherever the outermost layer is nearly tangent to lines - of - sight .",
    "it is not fully understood why the jump in emissivity appears in the calculated profile despite not appearing experimentally .",
    "it is conjectured that it may be a spurious effect resulting from emission outside the closed flux surfaces ; _ i.e. _ , in the scrape - off layer .",
    "in summary , a method has been implemented for deducing the emissivity profile of a nonaxisymmetric toroidal plasma based on images from a single camera location .",
    "reconstructions of flux surface visualizations yielded peaked profiles as expected , thereby serving as a promising test of concept .",
    "the fact that the non - uniform features from the photographs of the glow discharges did not appear in the reconstructed images serves to emphasize that this method will not account for non - uniformities in emission across a layer .",
    "a reconstruction of an ecrh discharge contained some unexpected features but still exhibited an overall hollow profile , consistent with expectations .",
    "future work will include incorporating the scrape - off layer in the onion - peeling inversion .",
    "a further improvement would be to cover larger portions of the cnt vessel , as well as the interlocked coils , with the light - absorbing material . as a result , larger portions of the experimental images",
    "would be suitable for inversion .",
    "the technique will then be deployed to study the variation of the emissivity profile over the course of ecrh heating pulses .",
    "profiles will be compared under different magnetic configurations and heating locations .",
    "optical filters may also be placed in front of the camera lens to isolate particular emission lines .",
