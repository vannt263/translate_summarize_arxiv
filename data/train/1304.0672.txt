    "in gravitational physics the metric tensor is of paramount importance since it permits to locally measure distances and angles , implying that any experimental result will depend on it . since the formulation of general relativity ( gr ) , the majority of gravitational theories assume the metric @xmath1 to encapsulate the dynamics of the gravitational field .",
    "however an equivalent description is provided by tetrad fields @xmath2 connected to the metric via @xmath3 . here",
    "latin indices refer to the local lorentz ( tangent ) space , while greek indices refer to the spacetime itself ( the manifold ) .",
    "any tedrad @xmath4 represents four lorentz vectors which locally connect the tangent space to the curved spacetime .    in gravitational theories which are preserved under both local lorentz and diffeomorphism transformations ,",
    "the tetrad and metric formulations are equivalent .",
    "however if a theory is not local lorentz invariant , different lorentzian observers at the same spacetime point will measure different outcomings from the same experiment .",
    "this is the case of @xmath0 theories of gravity .",
    "this kind of modified gravitational theories is based on the so - called teleparallel equivalent of gr ( tegr ) , which consists in an equivalent description of gr employing tetrads and torsion .",
    "the dynamics is determined by the torsion scalar @xmath5 which depends on the torsion tensor @xmath6 and , multiplied by the determinant of the tetrad , forms the lagrangian of the theory .",
    "the lagrangian of tegr is equivalent , up to a divergence term , to the gr lagrangian and thus the two theories are classically equivalent .",
    "moreover @xmath5 is local lorentz invariant only up to a divergence , which is enough to ensure that the tegr action is invariant under local lorentz transformations .",
    "the situation changes in the case of @xmath0 gravity which represents theories where the lagrangian depends on a general function @xmath7 of @xmath5 .",
    "if we now perform a local lorentz transformation the divergence coming from @xmath5 can not become a surface term because of the possible non - linearity of @xmath7 .",
    "this implies that @xmath0 gravity is a non - local lorentz invariant theory @xcite .",
    "in particular the gravitational field equations change under local lorentz transformations while the metric tensor remains unchanged .",
    "the situation of @xmath0 gravity , and in general of any non - local lorentz invariant theory based on a tetrad formulation , suggests the following question : given a specific metric tensor @xmath1 , does exist a tetrad @xmath2 , solution of the @xmath0 field equations , such that the relations @xmath3 holds ?",
    "this question gives rise to the following definition@xcite .",
    "+ * definition . * given a metric tensor @xmath1 , a _ good tedrad _ @xmath4 is a tetrad such that    * @xmath8 holds ; * @xmath4 is a solution of the @xmath0 field equations ; * the function @xmath0 can be choosen arbitrarily .    the last condition is needed for complete generality .",
    "it requires that the field equations must be satisfied for an arbitrary function @xmath0 and not only for specific models . a good",
    "tetrad selects the class of local lorentz observers who use the metric @xmath1 to measure physical distances .",
    "the concept is of main importance when one deals with exact solutions of the theory .",
    "as an example we will present a good tetrad associated with the schwarzschild - de sitter ( sds ) metric @xmath9 where @xmath10 .",
    "there is an infinite number of possibile tetrads which give back metric ( [ 001 ] ) , namely all the tetrads connected by a local lorentz transformation .",
    "we can thus look for a good tetrad adopting the following procedure@xcite : first we find a tetrad satisfying @xmath8 and then we use a local lorentz transformation in order to ensure that also the other requirements are satisfied .",
    "the simplest possible tetrad related to the sds solution is of course the diagonal one @xmath11 where @xmath12 is given in ( [ 001 ] ) .",
    "unfortunately this tetrad is not a solution of the @xmath0 field equations and even for other spherically symmetric metrics it represents a solution only in the @xmath13 case@xcite which is against the third point of our definition .",
    "even if ( [ 002 ] ) is not a good tetrad we can still apply a local lorentz transformation to find a good one .",
    "we will concentrate on local rotations given by the transformation matrix @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a three - diensional rotation characterized by the three euler angles @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 which are general functions of the spacetime coordinates . for our scope",
    "it is enough to consider only the following values @xmath19 then under the transformation ( [ 003 ] ) the diagonal tetrad ( [ 002 ] ) changes into@xcite @xmath20 in @xmath0 gravity the particular case @xmath21 was first considered for spherically symmetric spacetimes in ref .",
    ", where however was noticed that it is not a solution of the field equations , though it helps to relax the @xmath13 constraint arising with the diagonal tetrad .",
    "a good tetrad for the sds metric can be found from ( [ 006 ] ) if one chooses the function @xmath22 such that the torsion scalar becomes constant@xcite . in this case",
    "the tetrad ( [ 006 ] ) is a solution of the field equations provided @xmath23 satisfies @xmath24 with @xmath25 always gauged by the function @xmath22 .",
    "in other words for any value of @xmath26 one can always find a @xmath22 such that ( [ 004 ] ) is true .",
    "note that in the tegr case we have @xmath27 recovering the schwarzschild solution as required by the equivalence with gr .",
    "the definition of good tetrads for @xmath0 gravity is a useful tool when one deals with exact solutions of the theory .",
    "given a particular metric , it permits to define the class of local lorentz observers who use that metric to measure distances . in",
    "non - local lorentz invariant theories , such as @xmath0 gravity , different lorentz observers will not agree on the outcomes of gravitational experiments .",
    "it is important thus to determine the observers who employ physical metrics , such as the sds metric , for measurements .",
    "a good tetrad defines such observers in @xmath0 gravity .",
