    "after the discovery of the 125  gev higgs boson , the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics has become a complete theory ; within the sm , the remaining task is the precision measurements of various higgs properties , in particular its couplings , and to further narrow down the possible parameter space of new physics .",
    "although the hierarchy and meta - stable vacuum problems remain for the sm higgs theoretically , for new physics beyond the sm the absence of new physics signals at the lhc to date implies that extensions of the sm still only need to rely on the traditional particle physics facts of non - zero neutrino masses and baryon asymmetry . given these circumstances ,",
    "the presence of dark matter ( dm ) in our universe becomes an even more important leading empirical evidence for the existence of new physics , because no sm particle can account for dm .",
    "cosmology and astrophysics tell us that almost 85@xmath5 of matter in our universe is dark , i.e. , neutral , non - luminous and non - baryonic .",
    "the fact that the abundance of dm is comparable to that of ordinary visible matter seems to imply that dm may have the same or similar origins and properties as ordinary matter .",
    "if we accept the conclusion of quantum field theory ( qft ) that all matter should be made of particles , then an unambiguous , non - gravitational signal of dm must appear in particle physics experiments . this has driven the particle physics community to try harder to unravel dm s still enigmatic properties .    because details of the particle properties of dm are lacking ,",
    "the best investigative strategy for theorists is to try to cover as much ground as possible .",
    "considering that qft classifies particles according to their spin ( even or odd half - integers ) , elementary particles discovered so far all have low spins .",
    "most dm candidates discussed so far in the literature have been assumed to be spin-0 scalars @xcite or spin-1/2 spinors @xcite .",
    "whereas a scalar dm has relatively simple structure and provides possible intimate interplay with the 125  gev higgs , a spinor dm extends the traditional observation that matter is composed of spin-1/2 particles .",
    "the heavy sterile neutrinos @xcite and the lightest neutralino @xcite in supersymmetric models are dm candidates belonging to this type .",
    "apart from scalar and spinor dm , the next level of higher - spin candidate particles comprise spin-1 vectors .",
    "if we limit ourselves to the simplest vector particle scenario in particle physics , a single extra neutral vector particle , usually denoted by z , is sufficient .",
    "we shall discuss this possibility in the present paper . a higher spin case , spin-3/2 dm , has been discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "a vector particle z can be viewed as a gauge boson that mediates an extra @xmath6 gauge force beyond the conventional sm strong @xmath7 force and electroweak @xmath8 forces . for as yet unknown reasons , this additional @xmath6 gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken , thus yielding a massive z. sm plus z is a minimal and well motivated generalisation of the sm ; many new - physics models have such a @xmath9 boson ( for details see review refs .",
    "@xcite ) as a necessary constituent and remnant for new - physics interactions . before july 4 , 2012",
    ", the higgs was the superstar of particle physics searches and a z only played a supporting role . with the discovery of the 125  gev higgs , a z now becomes one of the hot new - physics candidate particles and the lhc is actively searching for it in various channels , with the model - dependent lower mass bound already reaching the tev - energy region depending on the final state it is assumed to decay into .",
    "now , if we further take the z as a dm candidate thus changing the z from visible to invisible , the interactions between the invisible z and sm particles will be strongly reduced , and the corresponding search strategies ( such as direct detection , indirect detection , and collider experiment ) will change with respect to those for visible z. various constraints must therefore be re - examined .    in the literature ,",
    "the invisible z has been intensively discussed as a messenger between the visible sector ( which contains the sm particles ) and a hidden sector ( to which dm belongs ) @xcite : in such a scenario , the sm particles can be either charged under the additional gauge symmetry or not . in the event that sm particles are neutral with respect to the extra @xmath6 symmetry , the interaction occurs via effective operators connecting directly z to the sm sector .",
    "the simplest case is the kinetic mixing terms between the sm hypercharge field strength and the new abelian field strength @xcite .",
    "the underlying reason in adopting z as a portal to the hidden sector stems from the traditional mediating role of gauge bosons . in this type of dm models",
    ", there are too many unknowns concerning the hidden sector , a situation that is not helpful in dm searches . in this paper",
    ", we consider an alternative simple approach by ignoring the conventional messenger role of z , and instead treat it as pure matter .",
    "this approach is similar to the minimal darkon model @xcite where sm is minimally expanded with the addition of a dark scalar ( sm+d ) , except now we replace the scalar darkon d with a single vector dm candidate z. the change from the traditional z portal model to our present single dark z approach is similar to that from the higgs portal model ( where a scalar is taken as a messenger between the visible and hidden sectors ) @xcite to the darkon model . after the reduction , because of the unique choice of dm candidate , we can ignore the uncertainties arising from the arbitrary hidden sector in the traditional z or higgs portal models .",
    "the difference in the present approach with respect to scalar dm is that our dark z is a vector particle , which behaves not like a scalar or higgs boson , but very much like a z boson of sm and will have relatively complex interaction structure owing to its polarisation .",
    "a spin-1 dark matter candidate appears in models with one extra dimensions  @xcite and has been widely studied in this context   @xcite .",
    "note that this is not a generic prediction of extra dimensions , as in higher then 5 dimensions the candidate is a scalar  @xcite , and a scalar is again found in models of pseudo - goldstone higgs in warped space  @xcite and technicolor  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section",
    "ii , in terms of the model - independent extended electroweak chiral lagrangian and the six assumptions needed to keep z dark , we determine the necessary operators that couple our dark z to sm particles . in section iii , we calculate the relic density produced from our single dark z , derive a constraint on the effective coupling of the dark z pair to @xmath10 or @xmath11 pairs .",
    "section iv looks at the direct - detection constraint , where we compute the sm gauge - boson - loop - induced @xmath12 vertex and discuss direct detection .",
    "section v examines indirect - detection constraints and includes discussions of the pamela , ams02 , and fermilat experiments . in section",
    "vi , we discuss the combined results and some other possible dm related issues .",
    "section vii presents a summary .",
    "some necessary results for section ii are to be found in appendix a.",
    "to make our investigation general , we start from a model - independent effective extended electroweak chiral lagrangian ( eewcl ) proposed in ref.@xcite , @xmath14 where @xmath15 for @xmath16 is the @xmath17-order of eewcl with z and all sm gauge fields , plus four necessary goldstone bosons described by a two - by - two unitary matrix field @xmath18 .",
    "the symmetry of the lagrangian is @xmath13 , which will be spontaneously broken to @xmath19 .",
    "the sm higgs field and the fermion fields are not included in the above lagrangian : in fact , couplings to the higgs are not required by the symmetry of the model and , if present , would reproduce a model of higgs portal dm .",
    "this implies that we ignore the possible direct ( or tree - order ) couplings between z and higgs ( a dark z with direct coupling to the higgs has been discussed in ref.@xcite ) or between z and sm fermions ( a dark z coupling directly to sm fermions has been discussed in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "these are the first two assumptions we adopt for our dark z. these higgsphobic and fermiophobic dark z assumptions simplify our theory significantly , and we take it as the first step in our investigation .",
    "although at tree level we can ignore the explicit higgs and fermion couplings , loops can still induce effective couplings .",

    "detection experiments , as we will show in the next section .",
    "in this section , we discuss the direct - detection constraints on dark z. direct - detection experiments are designed to measure the recoil energy of the atomic nuclei following dm elastic scattering .",
    "dm - quark interactions will naturally induce dm - nucleon interactions , and the latter further induce dm - nucleus interactions .",

    ", it can only couple indirectly to quarks through the sm gauge - boson loop depicted in fig .",
    "this loop diagram leads to finite effective vector - vector and vector - axial - vector interaction vertices @xcite : @xmath168 the finiteness of this loop - induced @xmath12 vertex implies that our fermiophobic assumption is consistent by itself .",

    "we next discuss some of these results :    * because the unique coupling @xmath109 is constrained to order @xmath178 in the typical few tens to few hundreds gev region ( see fig .  5 ) ,",
    "it is natural to ask if we go beyond the limitations set for the five arrangements and consider arbitrary @xmath179 couplings ; is there a possibility to enhance the value of the coupling ? to examine this issue , note that eq .",
    "( [ kvq ] ) gives @xmath180 , which then determines the final cross - section @xmath176 ; it depends on @xmath181 and @xmath182 .",
    "if we take @xmath183 , @xmath184 , then we achieve an arbitrary small @xmath180 and subsequently an arbitrary small scattering cross - section .",
    "for example , @xmath185 , @xmath186 , and @xmath187 leads to @xmath188 , which is already smaller by an order of magnitude than the five cases already derived in fig .",

    "5 by two orders of magnitudes and is equivalent to enhancing the constraint for @xmath109 by two order of magnitudes ; i.e. , it relaxes the constraint for @xmath109 from @xmath178 to @xmath190 , because experimentally we must fix the cross - section .",
    "therefore , we do have flexibility in the couplings in relaxing the constraints on @xmath109 ( or @xmath50 ) from direct detection . in the next section ,",
    "we shall see for indirect detection that this scenario does not arise as there exists no such coupling space . * as we have introduced in our theory the one - loop - induced @xmath12 vertex ( [ vandaxialv ] ) , one may inquire of the role of the one - loop - induced @xmath191 vertex depicted in fig .",
    "one can easily check that this loop diagram is logarithmically divergent .",
    "this implies that our first higgsphobic assumption , introduced in sec.ii , by which we ignore the direct coupling between z and higgs is not consistence by itself . to cancel such a divergence",

    "+ furthermore , once we have such a @xmath191 vertex , no matter whether it is a tree - level one added to the theory by hand or a loop - induced one , it can further decay via the higgs - mediated s - channel ( fig .",
    "7 ) into a fermion pair , which then leads to further corrections to the effective @xmath12 vertex given by eq .",
    "( [ vandaxialv ] ) .",
    "+ the reason that we do not consider this correction is as follows : suppose we abandon our first assumption by introducing the tree - level @xmath191 vertex into our theory .",
    "the @xmath191 vertex then includes two contributions : one is a tree - level term , and the other a loop term ( fig .  6 ) .",
    "after renormalisation ,",
    "i.e. , cancelling the loop - induced divergence ( fig .  6 ) by the tree - level term , the remaining finite part should not be very much different with respect to the finite part of fig .",
    "this finite part of the @xmath191 vertex via the higgs - mediated s - channel ( fig .",
    "7 ) further leads to an effective @xmath12 vertex , which is of scalar type @xmath192 or pseudo - scalar type @xmath193 .",
    "these vertices have different vertex structures in comparison with the vector and axial vector vertices given by eq .",
    "( [ vandaxialv ] ) . only the scalar vertex survives and it contributes to the nucleon cross - section similar to that in ( [ crosssectionvector ] ) , but has an extra factor proportional to @xmath194 with @xmath195 the mass of the u or d quark .",
    "this factor results from the replacement of the derivative - type vector coupling of ( [ crosssectionvector ] ) with the non - derivative - type scalar coupling @xmath12 ( see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "it is this suppression factor that allows us to ignore the loop - induced and tree - level @xmath191 vertices .",
    "although our higgsphobic assumption is not consistent by itself , ignoring it only creates a very minor correction and thus we can still approximately adhere to it .",

    ", we only discuss the universal case . combining all effective phenomenological constraints from the last three sections , we obtain fig .  14 , where the shaded region is excluded by the different experiments .",
    "the allowed region has a the left boundary at roughly @xmath220 gev : below this mass scale , the relic density constraint from fig .",
    "3 already contradicts data from the xenon100 and lux experiments .",
    "the lower bound above @xmath221 gev is the red curve from the relic density ( fig .",
    "2 ) , while the upper bound is from the pamela @xmath196 flux ratio constraint ( fig .  8) .",
    "we find @xmath109 is restricted to the region of @xmath4 .",
    "as discussed in the previous sections , this bound is quite solid , and it does depend mildly on the configuration of couplings .    considering the low - energy region below the threshold of the w boson mass , the relic density from fig .",
    "3 offers a very strong constraint , which combined with the direct - detection results kills any possibility of the existence of a dark z in this low mass region .",
    "if we simply ignore this fact , then a small dark z mass is allowed in this lower energy region .",
    "currently , though , tensions exist among the different direct - detection experiments in the low - energy region . for example",
    ", null results from cdms ge , xenon , lux and supercdms challenge the cogent / dama and latest cdms si results .",
    "because different experiments use different detection materials with different numbers of proton / neutrons , isospin - violating dm may weaken these tensions .",
    "it was demonstrated that isospin - violating dm with @xmath222-@xmath223 may alleviate the problem @xcite . for our dark z , @xmath224",
    "is given as follows : @xmath225 one can check that @xmath226 which further leads to @xmath227 clearly , the ratio is completely unrelated to the coupling constants @xmath228 , and @xmath217 .",
    "our dark z itself can not give @xmath229 ( adding in higgs boson may bring new vertices and change the rate ) . indeed , it was recently observed that the lux @xcite and supercdms @xcite data are in strong contrast @xcite with the cdms - si signal result @xcite , even for isospin- violating dm ( ivdm ) where the ratio of the proton - to - neutron couplings can be maximally `` xenophobic '' .",
    "another possibility to reconcile this tension is to consider an inelastically scattering dm model or an exothermic dm model @xcite .",
    "however , to realise inelastic scattering , we need at least two dm states .",
    "as our simplest dark z model only has one state , the present dark z can not produce inelastic scattering .",
    "this statement can be weakened in models where the z belongs to a triplet , i.e. it is accompanied by a w : this can be achieved in a chiral lagrangian with an extra su(2 ) symmetry  @xcite .",
    "remaining in our framework , we obtain the result that even if we ignore the strong constraint allowing our dark z to survive into the low - energy region , it still can not reduce the tension among those observed possible dm signals with other null result experiments .",
    "finally , we need to discuss the impact of our dark z model on other experiments in particle physics .",
    "first , following our second and sixth assumptions , there are no mixing of the z with the z and photon and no linear couplings of the z. this implies that there are no tree level bounds on the z couplings and mass from electroweak precision measurements@xcite .",
    "however , loops of the @xmath230 and @xmath0 couplings do generate corrections to both @xmath60 and @xmath63 parameters .",
    "such loop corrections are logarithmical divergent , and they lead to the renormalisation of the parameters @xmath35 and @xmath108 in the eewcl . therefore , the new physics effects must be encoded in the renormalised value of those parameters , and no robust and model independent bound on the couplings of the z can be extracted .",
    "furthermore , the allowed window for the coupling @xmath109 provides enough suppression to evade eventual bounds from the finite contribution of the loops .",
    "another issue regards the discovery potential at the lhc : as the only tree level couplings at the order we are interested in involve heavy gauge bosons , the only channels where the z can be produced are production in association with a gauge boson ( @xmath231 ) and vector boson fusion production ( @xmath232 ) .",
    "one may therefore look for a single @xmath209 signal or monojet .",
    "however , these channels suffer from large backgrounds , and we checked that the small allowed values of the couplings ( @xmath233@xmath178 ) would lead to cross sections that are too small to be detected at the lhc .",
    "we therefore conclude that the minimal model we study in this paper is not accessible at the lhc .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated a rarely discussed possibility where a z boson is the sole dm candidate .",
    "+ we considered an extended chiral lagrangian with an additional u(1 ) gauge symmetry , with the following additional assumptions :    1 .",
    "dark z is higgsphobic , i.e. , it does not directly couple to the higgs , 2 .",
    "dark z is fermiophobic , i.e. , it does not directly couple to sm fermions , 3 .",
    "there is no cp violating z couplings , 4 .",
    "there is no anomalous z couplings , 5 .",
    "dark z does not mix with @xmath68 and the @xmath11 boson , and 6 .",
    "there is no z interaction linear in the z field .",
    "the remaining quartic vertices , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , then dominate the z physics , which has four independent effective coupling constants @xmath234 .",
    "we found that the mass of this dark z is not allowed below the w boson mass threshold , due to a combination of strong constraints from the relic density and those from direct - detection experiments .",
    "for mass @xmath235gev , from the relic density and direct and indirect - detection experiments where effective @xmath2 couplings are induced from sm gauge - boson loops , we produce five different coupling scenarios that are in the region @xmath236@xmath178 ( for the universal case , the result is given in fig .",
    "this range of coupling can be relaxed beyond the five cases analyzed for direct - detection experiments , but can not be changed for indirect - detection experiments . to improve fermilat @xmath68-ray spectra by our dark z",
    ", we require a boost factor from 300 to 8000 .",
    "we checked that even if our dark z mass lies within the low - energy region , it can not reduce tensions among the observed possible dm signals with other null - result experiments .",
    "the bounds we extracted are therefore rather robust and model - independent .",
