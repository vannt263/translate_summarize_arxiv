    "limit , no revival of the magnetization to its initial value is visible , while the domain wall is not sharp either .",
    "these observations can be explained from the domain walls created adjacent to the initial spin flip , which can propagate in both directions simultaneously after the spin flip .",
    "moreover , correlations between two separated spins were considered , showing the buildup of correlations only after the passing of the spinon , displaying a light - cone effect .",
    "the evolution of the correlation therefore satisfies the lieb - robinson bound , as the correlations spread at the spinon propagation velocity .",
    "the algebraic bethe ansatz methods at finite size employed here could be implemented towards more out - of - equilibrium situations in spin chains , for which the dynamics could be computed from the determinant expressions for matrix elements of spin operators between bethe states .",
    "candidates for future applications of this method are the addition of non - integrable spin - spin interactions or driven magnetic fields to the heisenberg hamiltonian .",
