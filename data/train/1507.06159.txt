    "quantum noisy channels provide a convenient way of describing open quantum systems .",
    "they are at the forefront of interest in quantum information theory  @xcite . a subset of quantum channels called _ degradable _ channels  @xcite was shown to be especially important both from the physical and mathematical point of view . to get an intuitive idea ( that will be made precise later in the text ) what it means for a channel to be degradable , we recall that a quantum channel @xmath0 ( as any open quantum system ) interacts with its environment .",
    "the environment is also an open system and therefore a quantum channel . but",
    "this channel shares a lot of features with @xmath0  @xcite and it is called a _ complementary channel _ to @xmath0 .",
    "then , a channel @xmath0 is called degradable if it enjoys a nontrivial property that its complementary channel @xmath1 is given by the action of @xmath0 itself and another channel @xmath2 such that @xmath3 .",
    "hence , @xmath0 can be _ degraded _ to emulate the action of its own environment .",
    "as it turns out , many natural physical processes are in fact represented by degradable channels . to name a few ,",
    "the example is a trivial noiseless channel , the effect of decoherence for a two - level quantum system modeled as a dephasing channel  @xcite , the qubit amplitude damping channel describing the information propagation in a spin network  @xcite , optimal universal cloning machines  @xcite , attenuation and amplification one - mode gaussian optical channels  @xcite and some fundamental processes from the realm of quantum field theory in curved spacetime  @xcite .",
    "apart from its physical prominence , degradable channels play a vital role in the mathematical theory of quantum communication whose central task is the ultimate rate of reliable quantum communication .",
    "this is characterized by the quantum channel capacity  @xcite .",
    "quantum channel capacity is a fundamental physical quantity that characterizes the ability of a quantum system to coherently transfer a quantum message between a sender and receiver .",
    "a great deal of effort has been invested in understanding of its properties  @xcite .",
    "the problem is that except for degradable channels , the quantum capacity is virtually incalculable .",
    "interestingly , there is no unambiguous method known to the author to decide whether a degrading channel does _ not _ exist .",
    "more precisely , the non - existence can be unambiguously decided if only if the channel , whose degradability we investigate , satisfies a certain criterion . here in sec .",
    "[ sec : iffderivation ] we derive the criterion and our approach is based on the representation of quantum channels known as linear superoperators  @xcite introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : prelim ] . if the criterion is not met , we discuss the possibilities of how to proceed in order to disprove degradability but do not provide a conclusive method .",
    "that seems to be an interesting open problem .",
    "note that the opposite task of showing degradability is easy even if the criterion is not satisfied : one just needs to find a single instance of a degrading channel and the superoperator formalism is by far the most suitable instrument .",
    "showing the non - existence of a degrading channel was part of some previous works . ref .",
    "@xcite uses the superoperator formalism like we do but does not mention whether the calculation is conclusive ( it turns out that it is ) .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , visits this issue more than once and a connection to the non - uniqueness of a degrading channel is emphasized .",
    "it is even possible that the criterion derived here is known to the authors but it is never stated in full clarity as an iff condition ( see sec .",
    "ii . a of  @xcite ) .",
    "we illustrate and use the necessary and sufficient condition to extend the parameter range where the complementary channel to the qubit and qutrit transpose depolarizing channel  @xcite is degradable .",
    "we show that it contains a subset corresponding to an important class of channels known as the optimal asymmetric cloners .",
    "we are thus able to calculate their quantum capacity in sec .",
    "[ sec : iffderivation ] . finally , we discuss the implications of our result for the effort of finding exclusively conjugate degradable channels .",
    "they form a different class of channels from degradable channels and their quantum capacity is calculable  @xcite . it remains to be shown , however , whether it is a mere proper subset of degradable channels  @xcite .",
    "the definition is recalled in sec .",
    "[ sec : prelim ] and their link to the properties of bound entangled states derived in  @xcite is further explored .",
    "in this paper we will make an extensive use of two representations of completely positive maps : the choi - jamiokowski and superoperator formalism .",
    "the two formalisms are essentially identical but it makes sense to distinguish between them as each has advantages the other one lacks . in short ,",
    "a choi matrix gives up a quick check whether the map is cp and a linear superoperator is suitable for map composition and inversion by virtue of the standard matrix operations ( matrix multiplication and the generalized inverse ) .",
    "the relation between the representations was investigated in  @xcite and we will summarize the most relevant findings .",
