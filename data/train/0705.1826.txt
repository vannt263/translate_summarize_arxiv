    "non - axisymmetric deformations of rapidly rotating self - gravitating bodies are rather generic phenomena in nature and could appear in a variety of astrophysical scenarios like stellar core collapse  @xcite , accretion - induced collapse of white dwarfs @xcite , or the merger of two neutron stars  @xcite . over the years",
    "a considerable amount of work has been devoted to the search of unstable deformations that , starting from a quasi - axisymmetric stellar configuration , would lead to the formation of highly deformed rotating massive objects ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed list of references ) .",
    "one of the main reasons behind this interest is that such deformations would lead to the intense emission of high - frequency gravitational waves ( _ i.e. _ , in the khz range ) which is potentially detectable by ground - based detectors such as ligo , geo , virgo or the planned resonant detector such as dual  @xcite .    despite such extensive studies , various questions about the dynamics of the non - axisymmetric deformation of rapidly rotating self - gravitating bodies are not yet completely clarified . among the most important questions that have been addressed",
    "only rather recently it is worth to recall the following ones : _",
    "i ) _ how long do these deformation survive once they reach their maximum amplitude ? _",
    "ii ) _ how large is the energy emitted in gravitational waves ? _",
    "iii ) _ which physical phenomena determine the shortest damping timescale and impress a signature on the emitted signal ? _",
    "iv ) _ what is the effect of the stellar compactness @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the stellar mass and the proper equatorial radius , respectively , on the dynamics of the instability and on the threshold for its onset ?    while points _",
    "i)__iii ) _ were first addressed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter paper i ) , here we concentrate on providing an answer to question _ iv ) _ supplying new information on the general properties of the dynamical instability in a very large class of stellar models that are characterized by differential rotation and by high compactness and that are members of four sequences of models with constant baryonic mass .",
    "the main result obtained is that any non - axisymmetric deformation that develops in our models is damped over a dynamical timescale , through pure inviscid hydrodynamical nonlinear phenomena .",
    "moreover , for all the models that develop dynamical instabilities , the @xmath1 deformation eventually becomes the dominant one irrespective of whether the models are above or below the threshold for the development of the bar - mode instability ( see also paper i ) .",
    "this evidence is consistent with the simulations performed in newtonian gravity by ou and tohline  @xcite for stars with a very - low @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 is the ratio between the rotational kinetic energy @xmath7 and the gravitational binding energy @xmath8 ) , thus suggesting that this may be a general feature of this type of dynamical instabilities .",
    "in addition we show that , in a region of high stellar compactness , other instabilities , such as one having an @xmath0 deformation , can develop . finally , adopting an extrapolation technique developed and tested in paper i , we determine the threshold @xmath9 for the onset of the bar - mode instability for all of the sequences considered , thus determining accurately its dependence on the stellar compactness .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec : initial ] we briefly describe the initial data chosen and the numerical techniques employed for their evolution , while in sect .  [ sec : methodology ] we review the tools used in the analysis of the data .",
    "[ sec : compactness ] collects our results and there we first discuss the threshold of the bar - mode instability , its persistence , and eventually the onset of higher - mode dynamical instabilities .",
    "finally , sect .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] contains our conclusions and the goals of our future research .",
    "hereafter we use a space like signature @xmath10 , with greek indices running from 0 to 3 , latin indices from 1 to 3 and the standard convention for the summation over repeated indices . unless explicitly stated ,",
    "all the quantities are expressed in units in which @xmath11 .",
    "our simulations involve the numerical solution in three spatial dimensions ( 3d ) of the full set of einstein equations coupled to that of a perfect - fluid matter @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the fluid 4-velocity , @xmath15 is the fluid pressure , @xmath16 the specific internal energy and @xmath17 the rest - mass density , so that @xmath18 is the energy density in the rest frame of the fluid .",
    "the evolution of the spacetime must be supplemented by the evolution of the relativistic hydrodynamics equations : the conservation laws for the energy - momentum tensor @xmath19 and the baryon number @xmath20 , complemented with an equation of state ( eos ) of type @xmath21 .",
    "plane of the considered stellar models .",
    "indicated respectively with stars and filled circles are the @xmath22-stable and @xmath22-unstable models belonging to the four sequences of constant rest mass .",
    "triangles refer instead to models where the @xmath0 deformation is the fastest growing one . indicated with a solid line",
    "is the threshold of the bar - mode instability , while the dashed region represents the region of our estimated error - bars.,scaledwidth=100.0%,scaledwidth=75.0% ]    -0.8 cm    the initial data for our simulations are computed as stationary equilibrium solutions for axisymmetric and rapidly rotating relativistic stars in polar coordinates  @xcite . in generating these equilibrium models",
    "the metric describing an axisymmetric relativistic star is assumed to have the form @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are space - dependent metric functions . as in paper",
    "i , we assume the matter to be characterized by a non - uniform angular - velocity distribution of the form @xmath28 \\ ; , \\label{eq : velocityprofile}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the coordinate equatorial stellar radius and the coefficient @xmath30 is a measure of the degree of differential rotation , which we set to @xmath31 .",
    "all the equilibrium models considered here have been calculated using the relativistic polytropic eos ( @xmath32 ) with @xmath33 and @xmath34 and are members of four sequences having a constant rest mass @xmath35 equal to @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "the main properties of the four sequences are reported in tables [ table : initiala]-[table : initiald ] , which report the _ baryonic _ mass @xmath35 , the gravitational mass @xmath3 , the angular momentum @xmath40 , the rotational kinetic energy @xmath7 , the gravitational binding energy @xmath8 and the instability parameter @xmath41 , and whose definitions are @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the lapse function , @xmath44 is the square root of the three - dimensional metric determinant and @xmath45 is the fluid lorentz factor .",
    "we stress that that the definitions  ( [ eq : def m])([eq : def w ] ) of quantities such as @xmath40 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath5 are meaningful only in the case of stationary axisymmetric configurations and should therefore be treated with care once the rotational symmetry is lost .",
    "traditionally , numerical simulations of the dynamical bar - mode instability have been sometimes sped up by introducing very large @xmath22 deformations in the initial condition .",
    "as discussed in paper i , the introduction of any perturbation ( especially when this is not a small one ) may lead to spurious effects and erroneous interpretations .",
    "being aware of this , we used , only in some selected simulations below the threshold , initial density perturbations of the type @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the amplitude of the @xmath22 perturbation ( which we set to be @xmath48 ) .",
    "this perturbation has then the effect of superimposing on the axially symmetric initial model a bar deformation that is larger than the ( unavoidable ) @xmath49-mode perturbation introduced by the cartesian grid discretization .",
    "the introduction of such perturbation allowed us to estimate the frequency of the @xmath22 mode below the threshold for the onset of the instability and reduce considerably the computing costs in a region of the parameter space where the instability does not develop .",

    "<S> we present new results on dynamical instabilities in rapidly rotating neutron - stars . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , using numerical simulations in full general relativity , we analyse the effects that the stellar compactness has on the threshold for the onset of the dynamical bar - mode instability , as well as on the appearance of other dynamical instabilities . by using an extrapolation technique developed and tested in our previous study  @xcite , we explicitly determine the threshold for a wide range of compactnesses using four sequences of models of constant baryonic mass comprising a total of 59 stellar models . </S>",
    "<S> our calculation of the threshold is in good agreement with the newtonian prediction and improves the previous post - newtonian estimates . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we find that for stars with sufficiently large mass and compactness , the @xmath0 deformation is the fastest growing one . for all of the models considered , </S>",
    "<S> the non - axisymmetric instability is suppressed on a dynamical timescale with an @xmath1 deformation dominating the final stages of the instability . </S>",
    "<S> these results , together with those presented in  @xcite , suggest that an @xmath1 deformation represents a general and late - time feature of non - axisymmetric dynamical instabilities both in full general relativity and in newtonian gravity . </S>"
