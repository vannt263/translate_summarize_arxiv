    "the atiyah - singer index theorem @xcite relates the topological charge of the background gauge field configuration to the number of fermionic zero - modes of the dirac operator .",
    "the theorem states a particular connection between the background gauge field and the fermionic fields .",
    "it is a theorem derived on differentiable manifolds , however .",
    "quantum field configurations and in particular lattice fields are non - differentiable .",
    "hence it is of interest to study on the lattice the topology of the gauge background as well as the properties of the zero - modes of the dirac operator .",
    "a major progress in understanding the manifestation of the index theorem on the lattice was the realization that the eigenvectors of a @xmath1-hermitian lattice dirac operator with real eigenvalues should be interpreted as the lattice counterparts of the continuum zero - modes .",
    "this can be understood from the fact that only eigenvectors @xmath2 with real eigenvalues can have non - vanishing pseudoscalar matrix elements @xmath3 , like the zero - modes in the continuum .",
    "continuum qed in 4d in its usual non - compact realization for the gauge field has no topological charge .",
    "for the lattice formulation with compact representation of the gauge fields on the other hand the situation changes .",
    "lattice qed exhibits a twofold phase structure : a physical one , containing the massless photon and a confining phase with properties similar to qcd .",
    "some phenomena appearing in the confinement phase are : zero modes , magnetic monopole - antimonopole pairs and the occurrence of a non - zero chiral condensate .",
    "chiral symmetry breaking is a key feature of the theory of strong interactions , qcd .",
    "the order parameter is the chiral condensate @xmath4 ; it is related to the density of eigenvalues @xmath5 of the dirac operator near the origin via the banks - casher relation @xcite .",
    "as compact lattice qed shows a confining phase for certain values of the coupling constant one also expects @xcite and indeed observes @xcite the appearance of a chiral condensate .    for a study of zero - modes and chiral symmetry breaking",
    "it is advisable to work with chirally symmetric dirac operators . on the lattice chiral symmetry",
    "is realizable in a locally violated form , expressed through the ginsparg - wilson relation @xcite which in its original form reads : @xmath6 where @xmath7 denotes the massless dirac operator , @xmath8 is the lattice spacing and @xmath9 a local function of the gauge fields . in the continuum limit",
    "@xmath7 anticommutes with @xmath1 thus showing chiral symmetry .",
    "dirac operators satisfying the ginsparg - wilson relation preserve a lattice version of chiral symmetry @xcite without fermion doubling .",
    "for a given local operator @xmath9 there may be many dirac operators .",
    "the eigenvalue spectrum of a dirac operator for @xmath10 lies on a unit circle around the center @xmath11 and complex eigenvalues come in complex conjugate pairs . only for real @xmath12 the expectation value of @xmath1 between the eigenstates",
    "@xmath13 is non - zero .",
    "therefore exact zero - modes have definite chirality .",
    "although there are several realizations of the dirac operator satisfying the ginsparg - wilson relation approximately , only the numerically costly overlap operator @xcite is an exact realization .",
    "within qcd there have been several studies on the density of near - zero - modes and the properties of exact zero - modes and their relationship to topological excitations ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    in compact lattice qed",
    "there have been studies with the overlap operator @xcite demonstrating the existence of zero - modes in the confined phase and relating the density of the near - zero - modes to the universal distributions from random matrix theory .",
    "here we want to continue the study of such modes with an emphasis on the chirality and the localization properties of exact zero - modes and possible correlations to topological structures like monopoles .",
    "the wilson gauge action reads @xmath14=\\beta \\sum_{x , \\mu>\\nu } ( 1-\\cos \\theta_{x,\\mu\\nu})\\;,\\ ] ] where the gauge fields are represented by group elements @xmath15 with @xmath16 $ ] .",
    "the plaquette angles are given by @xmath17 .",
    "this compact realization of the gauge fields and the action introduces higher order self - interactions .",
    "the pure gauge theory has a confinement phase for small @xmath18 and a coulomb phase above a phase transition which for this action is close to @xmath19 and weakly 1st order @xcite ( for a recent study of the phase transition suggesting a new order parameter cf .",
    "one observes an abundance of monopoles in the confined phase .",
    "monopoles in compact @xmath0 are defined following ref .",
    "@xcite from deficit angles of the plaquettes bordering 3-cubes , corresponding to links on the dual lattices .",
    "due to current conservation the links form closed loops ( better : networks @xcite ) on the dual lattice .",
    "the massless overlap operator @xmath20 may be written @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes the operator @xmath23-function and @xmath24 is some hermitian dirac operator , constructed from an arbitrary dirac operator .",
    "it is convenient to use for @xmath25 the usual wilson dirac operator with negative mass term and @xmath26 is a real parameter which can be adjusted such as to optimize the convergence in the construction of @xmath27 . if @xmath25 is already an overlap operator then @xmath28 .    for a @xmath0 gauge theory on manifolds with torus topology",
    "there is no topological charge in the sense of a non - vanishing pontryagin index .",
    "so the atiyah - singer index theorem may be realized only trivially , i.e. allowing for a cancellation between the numbers of left - handed and right - handed zero - modes .",
    "however , on the lattice we have non - differentiable fields and therefore we may expect other violations as well .",
    "it has been demonstrated in qcd that for instanton configurations the dirac operator shows a zero - mode localized in space - time @xcite . to our knowledge nothing is known about the localization properties of zero - modes in qed .    in order to study",
    "the localization properties a simple set of gauge invariant quantities has been introduced . for an eigenvector @xmath29 of the lattice dirac operator one defines a local density @xmath30 where @xmath31 is an element of the clifford algebra and the local sum runs over the dirac indices .",
    "the eigenvectors are normalized to unit norm , i.e. @xmath32 for the cases of particular interest we abbreviate the scalar density @xmath33 ( for @xmath34 the unit matrix ) and the chiral density @xmath35 ( for @xmath1 ) .",
    "we also determined the vector densities @xmath36 ( for @xmath37 ) , the axial vector densities @xmath38 ( for @xmath39 ) and the tensor densities @xmath40 ( for @xmath41 ) .",
    "exact zero - modes are also eigenmodes of @xmath1 with eigenvalues @xmath42 .",
    "therefore for such eigenmodes we expect even locally @xmath43 the integral over the chiral density provides a measure for the amount of chiral symmetry breaking because it takes on its largest value for the zero - modes , namely @xmath44 for normalized eigenvectors , and vanishes otherwise .",
    "the so - called _ inverse participation ratio _ ( ipr ) is introduced for further quantification of the localization ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) . we define it for both , @xmath45 and @xmath46 : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the lattice volume .",
    "assume that the density is evenly distributed on a subvolume @xmath49 with @xmath50 and vanishing elsewhere .",
    "then we find @xmath51 , with the limiting cases @xmath52 for distribution over the whole lattice and @xmath53 for localization at one point .",
    "it is essentially the inverse fraction of the volume contributing to the mode .",
    "this makes it an appropriate measure for the localization of eigenmodes .",
    "let us try to understand why the inverse participation ratio @xmath54 may be considerably smaller than @xmath55 for near - zero - modes than for exact zero - modes .",
    "the local dirac sum may be written as a sum of two positive terms @xmath56 where @xmath57 . therefore @xmath58 . due to this property @xmath54",
    "is bounded for all eigenmodes : @xmath59 . for exact eigenmodes",
    "we have @xmath60 due to ( [ pp5relation ] ) .",
    "consider now eigenmodes corresponding to eigenvalues far from the origin : @xmath35 will be much smaller than @xmath61 and fluctuate around zero . in this case",
    "@xmath54 is expected to be significantly smaller than @xmath55 . when the eigenvalues approach zero @xmath54 increases and the ratio @xmath62 is expected to approach @xmath63 .",
    "we also determine different densities @xmath64 for exact zero - modes of chirality + 1 or -1 .",
    "this amounts to checking relations like e.g. @xmath65 which we could verify .",
    "the background gauge fields were obtained by using the metropolis and overrelaxation updating algorithm .",
    "all configurations are well decorrelated , separated by @xmath66 updating sweeps .",
    "we analyzed @xmath67 configurations on the @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 lattices and @xmath71 on @xmath72 lattices .",
    "for the computation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors the so - called implicitly restarted arnoldi method @xcite was used .",
    "the overlap operator was computed by an appropriate series expansion . only the smallest @xmath73 eigenvalues and their eigenvectors were calculated .",
    "real eigenmodes at zero have exact values @xmath74 .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     fig .",
    "[ fig : density ] compares the densities for the confinement region with those for the coulomb region , exhibiting a different behavior . in the confinement region one",
    "expects for @xmath75 a distribution following the chiral unitary ensemble of random matrix theory @xcite and we overlay a fit to that functional behavior @xmath76 in the coulomb region the results for @xmath77 and @xmath78 are compatible with each other indicating that there is no gap , different to the observed behavior in the deconfined phase in qcd .",
    "our statistics is not sufficient to exclude a small gap , though .",
    "for the zero - modes we observe @xmath79 as expected for exact gw - fermions and thus also the iprs agree . for chiral eigenmodes",
    "we expect local agreement of those densities which correspond to relations for the gamma matrices like @xmath80 , i.e. @xmath81 .",
    "indeed the tensor densities for the chiral modes do obey this relation within their group .",
    "the local densities for vector and axial vector both vanish . for non - zero - modes",
    "these relations are not valid .    in general",
    "the integrated tensor densities are comparatively small in absolute magnitude ( @xmath82 ) for zero - modes . for near - zero - modes",
    "all integrated vector , and tensor densities are small ( @xmath82 ) .",

    "sector ) at @xmath83 and @xmath77 ( lattice size @xmath70 ) : mean values of ipr ( l.h.s . ) and ipr - histograms ( r.h.s . ) .",
    "the exact zero modes in the @xmath84 sector have a wider distribution ( shaded area ) extending to higher values ; the @xmath85 and s.d . for those is indicated by the filled circle ( arrow ) and error bars in the upper l.h.s . plot .",
    "[ fig : ipr],height=226 ]    the inverse participation ratio should allow some information on the space - time localization of the eigenmodes . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ipr ] we summarize this quantity for the modes for _ non - zero _ eigenvalues , binned according to im(@xmath12 ) and also show the ipr histograms . in the confinement region",
    "we find no increase of the localization for the lowest bins .",
    "this observation differs from results in qcd studies @xcite , where also the near - zero modes show stronger localization .    in the coulomb region",
    "no modes at very small @xmath86 were observed and the low - lying modes show small ipr , close to the minimum of 1 .",
    "let us now concentrate on the _ exact _ zero - modes in the confining phase .",
    "these are well localized objects with comparatively large individual ipr values up to 4.2 . for fixed @xmath18",
    "the @xmath85 show little if any volume dependence with values of 1.92(29 ) for @xmath87 and 2.03(69 ) for @xmath88 ( this independence on the volume was also observed in recent qcd studies @xcite ) .",
    "these values are , however , clearly larger than the mean values for the small non - zero modes .",
    "the difference is mainly due to an ipr distribution extending to much higher individual ipr values , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : ipr ] .",
    "the values of ipr for the lowest non - zero modes for the sector with no or that with one exact zero mode agree within small errors .    in an attempt to visualize the geometrical shape of these localized zero - modes we studied 3d cuts of the density distribution . fig .",
    "[ fig : mcdensity ] gives an example of the observed structure .",
    "we plot the surfaces of constant density @xmath61 for an exact zero - mode for the eight 3d time slices ( @xmath89 ) of the @xmath70 lattice .",
    "the shape describes a tubular structure in 4d . however , most of the observed shapes are less clear and often made up from disconnected pieces .",
    "contrary to qcd @xcite no clear instanton - like picture ( i.e. 4d `` blobs '' ) evolves .",
    "the structure we observe for the zero - mode eigenvectors are sometimes ball - like in 4d , sometimes tube - like , even tubes closed in some direction due to the periodic boundary conditions . although a relation to the concept of closed monopole loops ( cf . ref .",
    "@xcite ) may be conjectured , no stringent conclusion can be drawn .",
    "@xmath90    this evidence supports the notion , that the zero - modes are not instanton - like lumps , but extended and periodically closed in one or more directions . in a recent study @xcite of the zero - modes in qcd it was argued , that the scaling of @xmath91 with the lattice spacing may be used to identify the co - dimension of these objects .",
    "due to lack of results at several different lattice spacing we can not attempt this here . in ref .",
    "@xcite values of @xmath92 were observed , i.e. larger than our values @xmath93 , indicating even stronger localization .    in order to gain further insight , we determined for some gauge configurations the eigenmodes of the dirac operator applying also anti - periodic boundary conditions in the time direction by multiplying all temporal gauge links of a timeslice with -1 .",
    "this leaves the gauge action invariant ( although it is not a gauge transformation on the finite lattice ) .",
    "the number of monopoles and dirac plaquettes does not change , either .    however , the characteristic polynomial coefficients of the eigenvalue equation for the dirac matrix involve traces over closed loops and thus may differ due to the periodically closed loops .",
    "the dirac matrix was diagonalized again for the such modified gauge configuration and the eigenvalues were compared with the ones without an added phase : quite often the zero - modes disappeared .",
    "where the zero - mode survived the transformation , the @xmath94-d density of the new eigenvectors had a completely different structure .",
    "this confirms the suspicion that for @xmath0 gauge theory the zero modes are related to lumps extending in at least one direction .",
    "changing the boundary conditions in qcd sometimes also repositions topological objects ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) and in a recent analytical study it was reported @xcite that zero modes with constant curvature may be constructed in the @xmath0 subgroup .",
    "these modes may be `` switched '' on and off by changing the boundary conditions .",
    "this is in agreement with our observation .",
    "@xmath95    in 2d the pontryagin index is constructed from @xmath96 . on the lattice for compact @xmath0 gauge theory and with torus topology various explicit configurations with such topological charge",
    "have been explicitly constructed as well as observed in monte carlo simulations ( e.g. in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in 4d",
    "the topological charge is proportional to @xmath97 and a possible method @xcite to construct objects with non - vanishing topological charge is e.g. to combine two - dimensional submanifolds , both with topological charge in the 2d definition .",
    "intersections of 2d surfaces in 4d may be points as well as more complicated , e.g. line - like objects . in ref .",
    "@xcite such a configuration - as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite has been studied and identifies as leading indeed to exact zero - modes . for unit",

    "[ fig : artificialmode ] shows the geometric shape of the eigenvector density of this mode and we observe tubular structures .",
    "note , however , that the tubes are in the 3d intersections , i.e. extend like planes in 4d .",
    "we have studied zero - mode properties of the overlap dirac operator for @xmath0 gauge theory in the confined phase .",
    "we find no correlation between the occurrence of these modes and the monopole density confirming @xcite .",
    "we do observe individual zero - modes with definite chirality .",
    "this would contradict the atiyah - singer index theorem if applied naively for lattice systems .",
    "however , for @xmath0 lattice gauge theory for compact gauge fields the situation changes .",
    "in particular the confinement phase of this system has no analytic continuation to the weak coupling continuum limit . in the confinement phase",
    "one can explictly construct configurations with topological charge and zero - modes @xcite , essentially by combining two 2d sub - manifolds with non - vanishing 1st chern number .",
    "in the coulomb phase there are no zero - modes and also the near - zero - modes are suppressed .",
    "there we find no pronounced localization signal . in the confinement phase the exact zero - modes are definitely more localized than other eigenmodes ( as exhibited by the inverse participation ratio ) .",
    "the ipr of the nearby non - zero modes does not seem to depend on the im(@xmath12 ) .",
    "the geometrical structure of the zero eigenmodes has no clear signature singling out 4d blobs - in contrast to e.g. the case of instantons in qcd , which have been observed in distorted hyperspherical shapes .",
    "all evidence points to tubular or even planar structures supporting the density function @xmath61 for a zero - mode .",
