    "in low - dimensional molecular lattices , the nonlinear nature of vibrational excitons ( vibrons ) plays a key role for energy transfer as well as energy storage in both physical , chemical and biological systems . in a general way",
    ", two main sources yield a nonlinear dynamics , namely the intrinsic intramolecular anharmonicity of each molecule and the extrinsic coupling between the vibrons and surrounding low frequency excitations ( such as phonons for instance ) .    in classical lattices ,",
    "the anharmonicity gives rise to the occurences of intrinsic localized modes , or discrete breathers , which have been the subject of intense researches during the last decade ( for a recent review see for instance refs .",
    "these highly localized vibrations do not require integrability for their existence and correspond to quite general and robust solutions @xcite .",
    "since discrete breathers favor a local accumulation of the energy which might be pinned in the lattice or may travel through it , they are expected to be of fundamental importance for both energy storage and transport . unfortunately , no clear evidence has yet been found for the existence of breathers in real molecular lattices .",
    "by contrast , in the quantum regime , two - vibron bound states ( tvbs ) have been observed in several low - dimensional systems @xcite . in that case , the intramolecular anharmonicity breaks the vibron independence and favors the formation of bound states @xcite .",
    "when two vibrons are excited , a bound state corresponds to the trapping of two quanta over only a few neighboring molecules with a resulting energy which is lesser than the energy of two quanta lying far apart .",
    "the lateral interaction yields a motion of such a state from one molecule to another , thus leading to the occurrence of a delocalized wave packet with a well - defined momentum . as a result ,",
    "tvbs are the first quantum states which experience the nonlinearity and can thus be viewed as the quantum counterpart of breathers or soliton excitations @xcite .",
    "the second source of nonlinearity , which originates in the coupling between vibrons and low frequency excitations , was first pointed out by davydov and co - workers @xcite to explain the mechanisms for bioenergy transport .",
    "the main idea is that the energy released by the hydrolysis of atp can be stored in the high frequency c = o vibration ( amide - i ) of a peptide group of a protein .",
    "the dipole - dipole coupling between the different peptide groups leads to the delocalization of the internal vibrations and to the formation of vibrons .",
    "however , the coupling between the vibrons and the phonons of the protein yields a nonlinear dynamics which counterbalances the dispersion created by the dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "it leads to the creation of the so called davydov s soliton which provides an approximation to the self - trapping phenomena described by a fr@xmath1hlich type hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "soliton mechanisms for bioenergy transfer in proteins have received increasing attention during the last twenty five years and a broad review can be found in refs.@xcite .    however , as pointed out by brown and co - workers @xcite and by ivic and co - workers @xcite , the solution of the davydov s problem is rather a small vibron - polaron than a vibron - soliton .",
    "indeed , the self - trapping process exhibits two asymptotic solutions depending on the values taken by the three relevant parameters of the problem , i.e. the vibron bandwidth , the phonon cutoff frequency and the small polaron binding energy proportional to the strength of the vibron - phonon coupling . when the vibron bandwidth is greater than the phonon cutoff frequency , the adiabatic limit is reached .",
    "the phonons behave in a classical way and create a quasi - static potential well responsible for the trapping of the vibron .",
    "the vibron , dressed by this lattice distortion , forms a polaron which is described according to the soliton theory of davydov .",
    "by contrast , when the vibron bandwidth is lesser than the phonon cutoff frequency , the situation corresponds to the non - adiabatic limit in which the quantum behavior of the phonons plays a crucial role . as mentioned by the authors ,",
    "this situation corresponds to the vibron dynamics in proteins .",
    "therefore , a vibron is dressed by a virtual cloud of phonons which yields a lattice distortion essentially located on a single site and which follows instantaneously the vibron .",
    "the dressing effect modifies the vibron frequency , reduces the vibron bandwidth and allows for an attractive interaction between vibrons mediated by virtual phonons .",
    "such an interaction is responsible for the formation of bound states and it has been suggested that proteins can support solitons formed by bound states involving a large number of vibrational quanta @xcite .    as a consequence ,",
    "the previous results clearly show that both the intramolecular anharmonicity and the strong vibron - phonon coupling produce a similar effect onto the vibron dynamics and favor the formation of bound states .",
    "the present paper is thus devoted to the fundamental question of the interplay between both nonlinear sources .",
    "to proceed , the davydov model , modified by introducing the intramolecular anharmonicity of each amide - i vibration , is described within the small polaron approach .",
    "the two - vibron energy spectrum is studied with a special emphasis on the influence of the intramolecular anharmonicity onto the dressing effect .",
    "note that we do not investigate the formation of solitons but focus how attention onto the creation of tvbs , only .",
    "such a procedure is twofold .",
    "first , as mentioned previously , tvbs are the first quantum states sensitive to the nonlinearity .",
    "their characterization allows us to understand the interplay between both nonlinear sources and appears as a first step to study the formation of multi - vibron solitons .",
    "then , recent theoretical calculations have shown that single - vibron solitons do not last long enough to be useful at biological temperatures @xcite . by contrast , two - vibron solitons are more stable and appear as good candidates for bioenergy transport @xcite .",
    "note that a perfect knowledge of the two - vibron dynamics is also required to interpret some experiments such as time resolved pump - probe spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , the davydov hamiltonian for a one - dimensional molecular lattice is described . in sec .",
    "iii , we first realize a unitary transformation to remove the intramolecular anharmonicity . then , a modified lang - firsov @xcite transformation is applied to renormalize the vibron - phonon interaction and to reach the small polaron point of view . finally , a mean field procedure is performed to obtain the dressed anharmonic vibron hamiltonian . in sec .",
    "iv , we summerize the number states method used to solve the two - vibron schrodinger equation . in sec .",
    "v , a detailed analysis of the two - vibron energy spectrum is performed depending on the values taken by the relevant parameters of the problem .",
    "finally , the results are discussed and interpreted in sec .",
    "according to the original davydov model , the vibron - phonon dynamics in an @xmath0-helix protein is described by a one - dimensional system formed by @xmath2 sites periodically distributed along the lattice .",
    "each site is occupied by a peptide group which contains the amide - i vibration .",
    "the @xmath3th amide - i vibration is assumed to behave as an internal high frequency oscillator described by the standard creation and annihilation vibron operators @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the vibron hamiltonian is thus written as ( using the convention @xmath6=1 ) @xmath7 where @xmath8 stands for the internal frequency of the @xmath3th amide - i mode and where @xmath9 denotes the lateral hopping constant between nearest neighbor amide - i vibrations . in eq.([eq : hv ] ) , @xmath10 and @xmath11 represent the cubic and quartic anharmonic parameters of each amide - i mode .",
    "the amide - i vibrations interact with the phonons of the lattice which characterize the collective dynamics of the external motions of the peptide groups . within the harmonic approximation , each peptide group , with mass @xmath12 ,",
    "interacts with its nearest neighbor peptide groups via the lateral force constant @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , the phonons correspond to a set of @xmath2 low frequency acoustic modes , labeled @xmath14 , which the hamiltonian is defined as @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 stand for the phonon operators of the @xmath18th mode with frequency @xmath19 , @xmath20 denoting the phonon cutoff frequency .    finally , the vibron - phonon interaction hamiltonian , which characterizes a random modulation of the internal frequency of each amide - i mode , is expressed as @xmath21 where the coupling constant @xmath22 is written as @xmath23 in eq.([eq : delta ] ) , @xmath24 is defined in terms of the coupling parameter @xmath25 introduced in the original davydov model as @xmath26 ( @xmath6 as be reintroduced to avoid confusion ) .",
    "the vibron - phonon dynamics is thus described by the full hamiltonian @xmath27 which slightly differs from the original davydov model .",
    "the davydov hamiltonian is recovered from eqs.([eq : hv])-([eq : hvp ] ) by restricting the full hamiltonian to vibron - conserving terms , only , and by neglecting the intramolecular anharmonicity of each amide - i vibration .",
    "although the full hamiltonian @xmath28 yields a rather simple model for the protein dynamics , it can not be solved exactly due to the anharmonic contributions .",
    "the following section is thus devoted to its simplification to obtain an effective hamiltonian describing the vibron dynamics .",
    "to remove the cubic and quartic intramolecular anharmonicity , the standard procedure described by kimball et al .",
    "@xcite is used .",
    "first , by disregarding the lateral coupling between nearest neighbor amide - i vibrations as well as the vibron - phonon interaction , the procedure consists in performing a unitary transformation @xmath29 to diagonalize each anharmonic amide - i mode .",
    "then , an approximate hamiltonian is obtained by applying the transformation on the full hamiltonian @xmath28 and be keeping the vibron - conserving terms , only .    as a result , by using the formula shown in appendix a , the transformed vibron - phonon hamiltonian @xmath30 is expressed as @xmath31 -j_{2}[b^{+2}_{n}b_{n+1}^{2}+h.o . ]",

    "the unitary transformation allows us to diagonalize each anharmonic amide - i vibration up to the second order with respect to the anharmonic parameters . as a result ,",
    "the vibron operators describe new vibrational states , called anharmonic vibrons , which are expressed as linear superimpositions of the harmonic states of each amide - i mode .",
    "therefore , eq.([eq : htilde ] ) clearly shows that the anharmonicity strongly affects the dynamics of these anharmonic vibrons .",
    "it first modifies the harmonic part of the hamiltonian by inducing a redshift of each internal frequency ( @xmath35 ) and by changing the strength of the lateral interaction ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "then , the anharmonicity is responsible for the occurrence of coupling terms which break the vibron independence and which directly affect the two - vibron dynamics .",
    "the terms @xmath37 and @xmath38 yield an attractive interaction between two vibrons and favor their trapping around the same amide - i site and around two nearest neighbor sites , respectively .",
    "the contributions proportional to @xmath39 characterize hops in the course of which two vibrons , initially located on the same amide - i vibration , realize simultaneously a transition to a nearest neighbor amide - i site . in the same way , the contributions proportional to @xmath40 affect single - vibron hops from states formed by two vibrons located onto the same amide - i vibration .",
    "finally , the anharmonicity leads to a correction of the vibron - phonon coupling hamiltonian and eq.([eq : htilde ] ) shows that single- and two - vibron states do not experience the same interaction with the phonon bath .",
    "when compared with the harmonic situation , the coupling between phonons and single - vibron states is enhanced by the anharmonicity , i.e. it is multiplied by the factor @xmath41 .",
    "moreover , the terms @xmath42 , which act onto two - vibron states only , show that two vibrons located onto the same amide - i mode interact in a different way with the phonons bath when compared with two vibrons which are far apart .",
    "note that the anharmonic corrections occurring in eq.([eq : parameter ] ) are typically of the order of @xmath43 and represent rather small contributions which have been neglected in our previous works @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , although some changes can effectively be disregarded , such as the modification of the hopping constants , other contributions play a significant role , especially the correction of the vibron - phonon interaction , as it will be shown in the following sections .",
    "the next step in our procedure is to partially remove the vibron - phonon coupling hamiltonian by performing a modified lang - firsov @xcite transformation . according to the ivic and co - workers s remarks @xcite ,",
    "the vibron - phonon dynamics is dominated by the so - called dressing effect since the non - adiabatic limit is reached . as a result",

    "this dependence originates in the modification of the vibron - phonon interaction mediated by the intramolecular anharmonicity ( see eq.([eq : htilde ] ) ) and the original lang - firsov transformation is recovered by setting @xmath48 .",

    "it takes into account on the anharmonicity up to the second order and allows for a renormalization of the main part of the vibron - phonon coupling within the non - adiabatic limit . the interaction hamiltonian @xmath67 , which characterizes the coupling between these dressed anharmonic vibrons and the remaining phonons , is assumed to be small in order to be treated using perturbation theory . such a contribution ,",

    "eq.([eq : hhateff ] ) clearly shows the interplay between the intramolecular anharmonicity and the strong vibron - phonon coupling .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath66 exhibits , basically , the same contributions as the vibron part of the anharmonic hamiltonian @xmath68 .",
    "the main difference is that the parameters occurring in @xmath66 are renormalized due to the dressing effect which modifies the dynamics according to two main ways .",
    "first , it yields additional contributions to the anharmonic parameters @xmath32 and @xmath69 as well as to the internal frequency @xmath8 ( eq.([eq : parameter2 ] ) ) .",
    "then , the dressing effect modifies the different lateral contributions via the dressing function @xmath70 which reduces the hopping constants .",
    "however , in a marker contrast with the harmonic situation , the intramolecular anharmonicity enhances the role played by both the small polaron binding energy and the coupling constant @xmath63 .",
    "in addition , the dressing effect depends on the vibron population .",
    "as shown in the next section , such a dependence discriminates transitions involving two vibrons located onto the same amide - i vibration from transitions involving two vibrons which are far apart .",
    "since the effective hamiltonian @xmath66 ( eq.([eq : hhateff ] ) ) conserves the number of dressed anharmonic vibrons , its eigenstates can be characterized by using the number states method @xcite . within this method ,",
    "the two - vibron wave function is expanded as @xmath71 where @xmath72 denotes a local basis set normalized and symmetrized according to the restricting @xmath73 due to the indistinguishable nature of the vibrons @xcite .",

    "this latter feature originates in the dependence of the dressing operators ( eq.([eq : theta ] ) ) on the vibron population . therefore , since @xmath85 is lesser than @xmath86 , it is clear that the trapping process experienced by two vibrons located onto the same site is more efficient than the dressing effect which modify the single - vibron dynamics .",
    "eqs.([eq : schrod1])-([eq : schrod3 ] ) clearly indicate how the physics of the two - vibron states is related to the dynamics of a single fictitious particle moving quantum mechanically on the two - dimensional lattice displayed in fig .",
    "1a @xcite . within this equivalence",
    ", the two - vibron wave function @xmath87 can be viewed as the wave function of the fictitious particle .",
    "its dynamics is described by a tight - binding hamiltonian characterized by the self - energy @xmath88 located on each site and a hopping matrix @xmath89 which couples nearest neighbor sites . however , the 2d lattice exhibits two rows of defects ( see fig .",
    "1a ) which yield a redshift of the self - energy of the corresponding sites as well as for a modification of the hopping matrix elements connecting the defect sites .",
    "therefore , such defects allow us to discriminate between two different eigenstates .",
    "the eigenstates of the core of the lattice correspond to plane waves slightly perturbed by the defects .",
    "by contrast , the presence of the defects leads to the occurrence of states which are localized in the vicinity of the two defect rows . in terms of the two - vibron dynamics ,",
    "the previous equivalence yields two different kinds of eigenstates .",
    "indeed , the delocalization of the fictitious particle is associated to a free motion of the two vibrons , i.e. two - vibron free states ( tvfs ) , whereas its localization is connected to the occurrence of tvbs .",
    "note that in marked contrast with the standard hubbard hamiltonian for bosons @xcite , the presence of two defect rows in our equivalent lattice shows that the system can support two kinds of bound states corresponding to the trapping of the two vibrons either onto the same amide - i vibration or onto nearest neighbor amide - i sites , respectively .",
    "the schrodinger equation eqs.([eq : schrod1])-([eq : schrod3 ] ) can be expressed in an improved way by taking advantage of the lattice periodicity .",
    "indeed , the two - vibron wave function is invariant with respect to a translation along the lattice and can be expanded as a bloch wave as @xmath90 in eq.([eq : bloch ] ) , the total momentum @xmath91 , which belongs to the first brillouin zone of the molecular lattice , is associated to the motion of the center of mass of the two vibrons whereas the resulting wave function @xmath92 refers to the degree of freedom @xmath93 which characterizes the distance between the two vibrons .",
    "since the momentum @xmath91 is a good quantum number , the hamiltonian @xmath66 appears as block diagonal and the schrodinger equation can be solved for each @xmath91 value .",
    "therefore , when two vibrons are located onto sites which are far apart ( @xmath94 ) , eq.([eq : schrod1 ] ) becomes @xmath95 = 0 \\label{eq : schrod11}\\ ] ] where @xmath96 . in the same way ,",
    "when two vibrons are located onto nearest neighbor sites ( @xmath97 ) , eq.([eq : schrod2 ] ) is rewritten as @xmath98 where @xmath99 .",
    "then , when two vibrons are located onto the same site ( @xmath100 ) , eq.([eq : schrod3 ] ) is expressed as @xmath101 where @xmath102 .",
    "finally , for each wave vector @xmath91 , the two - vibron dynamics reduces to a one - dimensional tight - binding problem on a semi - infinite lattice which exhibits two defects ( see fig .",
    "the schrodinger equation eqs.([eq : schrod11])-([eq : schrod33 ] ) can thus be solved easily to obtain the two - vibron eigenstates and to determine the two - vibron energy spectrum .",
    "this procedure is illustrated in the following section .",
    "in this section , the previous formalism is applied to characterize the two - vibron energy spectrum of an @xmath0-helix protein .",
    "however , the present theory involves a set of parameters which has first to be discussed .    from the literature ,",
    "the harmonic dynamics of vibrons in @xmath0-helices is relatively well described ( see for instance refs .",

    "by contrast , the phonon dynamics as well as the vibron - phonon coupling parameter are only partially known .",
    "the mass @xmath12 of a peptide group ranges between 1.17 @xmath106 kg and 1.91 @xmath106 kg , whereas the phonon force constant @xmath13 is expected to be about 13 - 19.5 nm@xmath107 . as a result ,",
    "the phonon cutoff frequency varies from 87 to 137 @xmath104 . in the same way ,",
    "a typical range for the vibron - phonon coupling term is @xmath108 pn .",
    "therefore , the vibron - phonon coupling parameter @xmath24 ranges between 12 and 29 @xmath104 and the small polaron binding energy @xmath109 extends from 3 to 15 @xmath104 .    in a marked contrast with the previous parameters , little",
    "is known about the intramolecular anharmonicity of each amide - i vibration . therefore , to determine the range of the anharmonic parameters , we assume that the amide - i vibration is equivalent to the c = o stretching mode of a single molecule , but with a different reduced mass @xmath110 . by describing both vibrations according to a morse potential , it is straightforward to show that @xmath8 scales as @xmath111 whereas the anharmonicity @xmath32 scales as @xmath112 . by comparing the harmonic frequency of both the amide - i vibration and the c = o stretching mode ( @xmath113 @xmath104 @xcite ) ,",
    "the reduced mass of the amide - i mode is about 1.6 - 1.7 times the reduced mass of the c = o molecule . as a consequence ,",
    "since the anharmonic parameter for the c = o stretching mode is @xmath114 @xmath104 @xcite , the anharmonic constant of the amide - i vibration is about @xmath115 @xmath104 .",
    "note that this latter value represents an order of magnitude of the anharmonic parameter since , strictly speaking , the anharmonicity of the amide - i vibration depends on the details of the corresponding intramolecular potential .",
    "in addition , our calculations establish that both the cubic and quartic anharmonic parameters can be expressed approximately in terms of @xmath32 by using the relation @xmath116 .    as a result , in the following of the text ,",
    "the intramolecular anharmonicity will be described by a single parameter , namely the anharmonic constant @xmath32 .",
    "the small polaron binding energy @xmath109 is taken as a parameter whereas the phonon cutoff frequency @xmath117 is fixed to 100 @xmath104 .",
    "the temperature is set to the biological temperature , i.e. @xmath118 k , and the hopping constant is set to @xmath105 @xmath104 .",
    "the influence of the intramolecular anharmonicity on the two - vibron energy spectrum is shown in figs . 2 , 3 and 4 for three typical situations .",
    "in each figure , the spectrum is centered onto the corrected frequency @xmath88 ( eq.([eq : parameter2 ] ) ) and corresponds to the two - vibron dispersion curves drawn in the first brillouin zone of the lattice , i.e. @xmath119 .",
    "when @xmath120 @xmath104 and @xmath121 ( fig .",
    "2a ) , the two - vibron energy spectrum is formed by an energy continuum associated to the tvfs . this continuum is symmetrically located around @xmath88 with a bandwidth equal to 31.21 @xmath104 . below the continuum ,",
    "the energy spectrum exhibits two bands connected to two different bound states .",

    "all the previous features are accompanied by a modification of the wave functions of the bound states .    to understand these features",

    "the previous results clearly show that the system supports one or two bound states , depending on the values taken by the relevant parameters of the problem ( anharmonicity , small polaron binding energy , temperature ... ) .",
    "in other words , if these parameters are allowed to vary , a localization transition arises in the equivalent lattice .",
    "such a transition discriminates between two `` phases '' .",
    "the first phase corresponds to the presence of a single localized state ( i.e. a single bound state in the real lattice ) whereas the second phase is connected to the occurrence of two localized states ( i.e. two bound states ) .",
    "a localized state is characterized by its localization length @xmath144 which refers to the length of the bond between two vibrons in a bound state .",
    "the disappearance of a localized state is accompanied by a divergence of the localization length since it now refers to two independent vibrons .",
    "such a process is similar to a critical transition and consequently , we can use the tools of the renormalization group ( rg ) theory to understand the transition and predict the occurrence of localized states ( i.e. of bound states ) .",
    "this can be achieved by performing a decimation of the schrodinger equation as detailed in refs . @xcite and summarized in appendix b. the decimation consists in eliminating from the initial equivalent lattice one site over two to arrive at a scaled lattice with twice the lattice spacing . if the initial lattice is at a critical point , i.e. if the localization transition takes place , the localization length @xmath144 is infinite and the dynamics is in a self - similar situation . as a result ,",

    "for instance , both @xmath160 and @xmath156 depend on @xmath32 and @xmath109 .",
    "however , from eq.([eq : phase ] ) , we can define a phase diagram in the @xmath161 parameter space . such diagram is illustrated in fig . 10 for a zero wave vector",
    "the temperature is fixed to @xmath118 k whereas three different values for the hopping constant @xmath9 have been considered .",
    "the curve discriminates between a phase with a single bound state and a phase with two bound states , both states being located below the continuum over the entire brillouin zone since @xmath162 .",
    "the figure clearly shows that the anharmonicity favors the occurrence of two bound states by decreasing the value of the required small polaron binding energy .",
    "for instance , when @xmath105 @xmath104 and @xmath121 , @xmath109 must exceed 11.5 @xmath104 to allow for the occurrence of the tvbs - ii .",

    "however , due to the hopping processes , these two localized states overlapp and interact to generate new localized states which appear as superimpositions of the two previous states .",
    "such a mechanism is accompanied by a splitting of the frequency of the new localized states which depends on both the strength of the coupling between the original states as well as on their frequency . as a result",
    ", we obtain a high frequency localized state ( tvbs - ii ) and a low frequency localized state ( tvbs - i ) .",
    "if the splitting is strong enough , the high frequency localized state is pushed back into the continuum and a single localized state remains . by contrast , if the splitting is rather weak , both localized states can be located below the continuum . as shown in eqs.([eq : schrod11])-([eq : schrod22 ] ) , the intramolecular anharmonicity increases the energy difference between the two original localized states .",
    "in addition , since it enhances the dressing effect , it reduces the coupling between these two states . as a result",
    ", the anharmonicity favors a weak hybridization between the two original localized states .",

    "the present paper has clearly established the interplay between the intramolecular anharmonicity and the strong vibron - phonon coupling .",
    "we have shown that the anharmonicity modifies the vibron - phonon interaction which results in an enhancement of the dressing effect .",

    "the two bound states appear as combinations of states involving the trapping of the two vibrons onto the same amide - i mode and onto nearest neighbor amide - i modes .",
    "by contrast , the intramolecular anharmonicity reduces the hybridization between these two kinds of trapping so that the low frequency bound state refers to the trapping of the two vibrons onto the same amide - i mode whereas the high frequency bound state characterizes the trapping onto nearest neighbor amide - i vibrations .",
    "in addition , the anharmonicity strongly reduces the dispersion of the bound states and thus enhances their breather - like behavior @xcite .    to conclude ,",
