    "in the recent years , coupled cavity arrays ( ccas )  @xcite , have been put forward as a very suitable playground for the investigation of quantum many - body phenomena in photonics systems . due to their flexibility in the design , the possibility to control their dynamics ( through the choice of the couplings and external drive ) and the local accessibility of individual cavities ,",
    "these systems have been proposed as possible implementations of a quantum simulator .",
    "a rather comprehensive account of the large body of work in this field can be found in refs .",
    "the experimental requirements are quite challenging , however in the last two years there have been very interesting progresses  @xcite .",
    "an important ingredient determining the dynamics of a cavity array is the competition between photon hopping and the non - linearity present in each cavity , due to the coupling to a few - level system as for example in the jaynes - cummings model .",
    "whereas tunnelling between neighbouring cavities tends to delocalise the photons , the presence of the non - linearity , on the contrary suppresses number fluctuations , thus opposing to delocalisation . in the ( hypothetical ) absence of photon losses",
    "this competition would lead to a ( thermo)dynamics similar to that of the bose - hubbard model .",
    "the properties of cavity arrays in this regime have been carefully scrutinised in the recent literature , see e.g. the reviews  @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram in the one - dimensional case , related to the present study , has been determined by means of density matrix renormalization group in  @xcite .",
    "the presence of the unavoidable photon leakage would make the long - time dynamics completely trivial in the absence of an external drive that refills photons into the cavities .",
    "this additional competition , between losses and external pumping , makes the dynamical behaviour of these systems particularly rich .",
    "the interplay of ( coherent / incoherent ) driving and ( incoherent ) photon losses can be both observed in the transient and in the steady - state ( long - time ) regime . in this work we will be interested in the non - equilibrium steady state ( ness ) .",
    "only very recently the many - body non - equilibrium dynamics of cavity arrays started to be addressed see , _",
    "e.g. _ , refs .",
    "@xcite and several different properties both of the transient and steady - state regimes were highlighted .",
    "these include the spectroscopy of many - body photon states  @xcite , crystallisation of photons  @xcite , instabilities induced by pulsed driving  @xcite , steady state critical phenomena  @xcite .",
    "there is by now a compelling evidence that cavity arrays are naturally designed to become open - system quantum simulators .",
    "very interesting many - body effects should emerge in photon transport as well .",
    "most of the attention so far has been devoted to the transmission of one or two photons . in this regime ,",
    "transnport in one - dimensional systems has been already studied in a variety of situations , in the presence of a single two - level system ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , with extended nonlinearities  @xcite and in linear cavity arrays when the frequency of one or two cavities is tunable  @xcite .    moving away from the regime of few - photon transmission , it is natural to expect that the formation of many - body states of photons will considerably affect transport as well ; to the best of our knowledge , this effect has not been investigated so far .",
    "it is important to stress from the beginning that it is not obvious how strong correlations play a role in photon transport . for a single cavity ,",
    "the most striking effect is the photon blockade  @xcite .",
    "the presence of a single photon in a cavity , driven by an external coherent source , will block the passage of a second photon because of the strong non - linearities present in the cavity itself .",
    "how is the photon blockade modified in an extended system ? this is one of the questions that we will address .",
    "we make a first step in this direction by addressing the problem of photon transport through a chain of nonlinear cavities in presence of dissipation .",
    "the setup we consider is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : cavities ] .",
    "one end of the array is driven by a coherent laser source .",
    "we are interested in studying the light emerging at the other end of the array , linking its properties to the presence of complex many - body states in the array itself .",
    "our interest starts from ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was shown that the steady state of a ring of nonlinear cavities , uniformly pumped , is reminiscent of a strongly correlated tonks - girardeau ( tg ) gas of impenetrable bosons .",
    "inspired by this work , here we explore the impact of strongly correlated many - body states on transport .",
    "furthermore , it is worth mentioning at this stage that this system is also relevant for the understanding of single photon sources based on passive photonics devices  @xcite . changing a bit the perspective",
    ", the configuration we propose , can be view as an alternative scheme to detect and quantify the presence of strongly correlated states of light based on transport .",
    "usually , this kind of spectroscopic analysis is performed driving the whole array and studying the near - field and the far - field pattern .    in this work we mainly focus in the regime where on - site nonlinearities are much stronger than photon",
    "first we concentrate in the limit of impenetrable bosons : in this regime , repulsively interacting bosons form a tonks girardeau ( tg ) gas and behave as non - interacting fermions  @xcite .",
    "such limit is inaccessible with state - of - the - art experiments , but it is interesting in view of the rarity of exact solutions in many - body problems , and serves as a helpful benchmark for approximation methods in many - body theory .    determining the steady state , _",
    "i.e. _ , the long - time limit of a many - body lindblad equation , is a formidable task . in many - body open quantum systems",
    "the unavoidable exponential growth of the hilbert space with the system size merge with the need to represent mixed states , leading to a huge number of degrees of freedom to be taken into account . by means of an extension of the time - dependent density - matrix renormalization group to open systems  @xcite , we are able to attack this problem and study a large number ( up to sixty ) of coupled cavities .",
    "our numerical simulations are validated by means of an analytic approach based on effective models which take into account only few relevant degrees of freedom .",
    "the combination of ( essentially ) exact numerical methods together with the judicious construction of effective models allows to considerably enrich the understanding of the underlying physics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we discuss in details the model for the driven / dissipative coupled cavity chain of fig .",

    "the time evolution of the system density matrix is ruled by a master equation in the lindblad form = -+ [ ] , [ lindblad ] where the first term describes the coherent unitary time evolution , and the lindblad term takes into account the damping . in the rest of the paper we will consider independent photon losses from each cavity as the only dissipation channel .    assuming that the spacing between the modes of each cavity is larger than any other involved energy scale , we can write the system hamiltonian considering only one mode for each cavity _ 0 = _",

    "we found that the formation of strongly correlated ( many - body ) states of light in the ness determines the transport properties of the system we consider .",
    "remarkably , strong correlations play a dominant role also in very large arrays ( we simulated up to sixty cavity ) .",
    "this , we believe , is a nontrivial observation since the incoherent photon leakage from each cavity is expected to kill coherence between different cavities . additionally , since we refill the array just from one end ( while dissipation occurs extensively ) , it is not obvious that transport in large systems can take places at all .",
    "we found that the transmission of photons through the array displays single- and multi - photon peaks , which reveal the level structure of the array resulting from the competition between photon hopping and kerr - like nonlinearity .",
    "for weak driving strength only single - photon states appear in the transmission spectra . as the pump strength",
    "is increased , resonances related to many - body states start to appear . notwithstanding this fact , our work establishes that _ photon transport is controlled by many - body resonances related to extended states in the cavity array . _    in the tonks - girardeau limit , the number of transmitted photons on resonance with single- and multi - photon states has been fully characterized and the presence of strongly - correlated states of light in the steady state manifests in the behaviour of the two - body correlation function which signals a perfect antibunched statistics of the output field . in this regime",
    "we developed some truncated effective models ( based on a careful identification of the relevant degrees of freedom ) which allow us to confirm our numerical results and considerably increase the understanding of the physics of this complex system .",
    "the agreement is almost perfect , both for the populations and for the correlation functions , confirming the effectiveness of the mpo method for the investigation of large ( one - dimensional ) open quantum many - body systems .",
    "we went beyond the tonks - girardeau limit .",
    "we analyzed the case of a finite kerr nonlinearity .",
    "also in this case we found that the structure of the strongly correlated states in the steady state rules the transport .",
    "in particular , moving from the linear regime to the tonks - girardeau limit , the harmonic structure of the spectrum is progressively lost dramatically affecting ( and inhibiting ) the transport properties of the array .",
    "this effect is the generalisation to extended systems of the well known single cavity photon blockade phenomena . quite interesting in this respect would be the analysis of the transport in the opposite regime in which the hopping is dominating over the local non - linearity .",
    "here one expects that the spectrum of the hamiltonian has low - lying sound - like modes leading , in equilibrium , to quasi - long range order .",
    "it would be very interesting to see how photon transmission is modified in this `` superfluid '' regime .",
    "unfortunately the case of small kerr non - linearity is difficult to handle with the numerical methods used here as the dimension of the local hilbert space grows enormously . a dissipative luttinger liquid description or the truncated - wigner methods  @xcite",
    "are probably much more appropriate in this regime .",
    "to conclude , our analysis can be viewed as the multi - cavity generalisation of the classic experiments on photon blockade . by exploring these complex architectures that show a many - body photon blockade effect , as in the present paper , an additional ingredient to tune and control photon transmission at single- or few - photon level",
    "can be realised .",
    "note that by driving all the cavities , one is limited by symmetry reasons to address only few eigenstates of the system . on the contrary in our configuration , by suitably adjusting the laser - cavity detuning ,",
    "it is possible to excite all the many - body spectrum of the system paving the way to the possibility to perform a complete system spectroscopy of the array studying transport .",
    "in this work we compared the results of the mpo simulations with the outcome of some truncated effective models .",
    "all the results of this appendix refer to the tg limit ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "the first model we consider takes into account only the one - particle sector of @xmath17 and the vacuum . as in the main text",

    ", in this driving scheme , all the single - particle states can be excited .",
    "the non - unitary part of the evolution of the master equation   is governed by the lindbladian term  . in this case",
    "is more convenient to work with the annihilation and creation operators of bloch modes which are related the photons annihilation and creation operators as usual @xmath117 . using the orthogonality relation @xmath118 , it is easy to show that [ ] & = & 2_i=1^m(2_i^_i-^_i_i-^_i_i ) & & & = & 2_n=1^m(2_k_n^_k_n-^_k_n_k_n-^_k_n_k_n ) .",
    "also in this case all we need are the matrix elements @xmath119 .",
    "the result explains the why we worked in this different basis for the lindbladian term .",
    "the obm is expected to work when the driving is weak ( @xmath58 ) and therefore only the single - particle states play a role in the dynamics .",
    "nevertheless , if the pump is not resonant with a two - photon state so that the excitation of many - body states is strongly inhibited , the obm is expected to work even if the driving is not weak ( see , _ e.g. _ , figs .",
    "[ fig : pop1ph2 ] and  [ fig : dens1phlarge3 ] ) .",
