    "finally , there could also be a contribution from thermal instability @xcite .",
    "in this paper we attempt a direct observational identification of the energy sources that drive the turbulence .",
    "our results suggest that the energy input from young stars determines the h@xmath0i  line width within the star forming region of galactic disks , while at large radii , where star formation is absent or feeble , the line width is either sustained by the mri @xcite , or by thermal broadening from uv heating .",

    "@xcite   argue that sne , among other mechanisms of energy injection , are the most effective in actively star forming regions , while in the outermost regions of galaxy disks , where the sfr is low or zero , the mri becomes important in sustaining both the magnetic field , even in low density regions , and the gas velocity dispersion @xcite .",
    "we use multi - wavelength data in the radio , infrared ( ir ) , and far uv (   [ sec : data ] ) , to compare detailed maps of the ism kinetic energy density implied by 21  cm line widths to maps of the sfr density for a sample of nearby spiral and dwarf galaxies . in this comparison ,",
    "we take the sfr density as a proxy for the energy input rate to the ism . relying on the measurement of the velocity dispersion as a tracer of turbulence in the neutral gas ,",
    "we look at both the correlation between sfr and turbulent motions in the h@xmath0i  on a pixel - by - pixel basis and at their mean values as function of galactocentric distance (   [ sec : analysis ] ) .",
    "we find that the azimuthal average of the h@xmath0i  velocity dispersion decreases radially much more slowly than the sfr (   [ sec : results ] ) ; specifically , the radial profile of h@xmath0i   velocity dispersion approaches the h@xmath0i  thermal value for the warm neutral medium where the radial profile of sfr truncates .",
    "therefore , we investigate ( 1 ) pixel - by - pixel how the kinetic energy of the gas turbulence correlates with the sfr , especially in terms of sn rate , and ( 2 ) what role thermal broadening and mri play in regions of low sfr and considerable velocity dispersion (   [ sec : discussion ] ) .",

    "we only use @xmath53 in this context to calculate the central 2nd - moment .    the variance , corresponding to the square of the line - of - sight velocity dispersion , is given by the intensity - weighted mean deviation : @xmath54    throughout our analysis we restrict ourselves to the moment definition of eq .",
    "[ eq : mom_two ]  to define the variance .",
    "we presume that @xmath55 ( eq .  [ eq : mom_two ] ) is the most sensible tracer of turbulent or more precisely , disordered motions , since it is applicable to any line profile .",
    "we address the discussion of this assumption in   [ sec : realities ] .",
    "we complement the h@xmath0i  maps with h@xmath25 column density and kinematics data obtained from co emission (   [ sec : data ] ) .",
    "following the same procedure previously adopted to calculate the relevant h@xmath0i  maps , we obtain the mass surface density , @xmath31 , and the velocity dispersion , @xmath56 , for the h@xmath25 gas . as described in the following sections , while h@xmath25 is an important contributor to the total mass surface density , its contribution to the total turbulent kinetic energy of gas turns out to be rather small in our sample .      in the case of perfect signal ,",
    "the second moment is exactly the kinetic energy of h@xmath0i  gas .",
    "even at limited signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath57 ) but with normally - distributed noise , we expect the measured variance to scatter about the true value in a well - behaved way , so that by averaging measurements over enough area , we can approximate the true value .    as an alternative approach , assuming and then fitting a fixed line profile shape ( e.g. , a gaussian ) fails in two ways .",
    "first , towards the centers of galaxies , line profiles tend to be broad and often contain multiple emission components .",
    "second , in the outskirts of galaxies , where individual lines of sight tend to have relatively low @xmath57 , a simple gaussian fit tends to underestimate the line width by latching onto only the peak of the emission . in the low @xmath57 regime ,",
    "the line profiles are approximately gaussian .",
    "for a few sample galaxies ( ngc  3184 , ngc  5194 , ngc  6946 , and ngc  7793 ) we find that the gaussian @xmath55 value is systematically lower than the second moment .",
    "for these galaxies , however , the difference between gaussian @xmath55 and 2nd - moment is lower than @xmath58  @xmath3  in average . since we do not know a priori the h@xmath0i  gas line - of - sight velocity distribution , and the profiles are not necessarily gaussian",
    ", the best tracer of kinetic energy , as a model independent estimate , is the variance .",
    "therefore , we avoid fitting and attempt to minimize systematics by measuring the second moment only on regions that have been identified to contain signal .",
    "the production of these `` blanked cubes '' is described in @xcite , and is briefly summarized here .",
    "first , the cubes were smoothed to 30  angular resolution .",
    "then , all areas without @xmath59 in 2 consecutive velocity channels are blanked ( set to 0 ) .",
    "this does an excellent job of identifying all areas with significant emission but still left some false positives .",
    "these were removed by a by - eye inspection that focused on agreement with the overall velocity structure and morphology of the galaxy .",
    "we test the systematics induced by such blanking on a face - on galaxy by measuring @xmath55 on the blanked cube and then expanding the blanking mask and remeasuring @xmath55 .",
    "we find that small expansions of the mask on both directions along the velocity dimension , e.g. by @xmath60  km  s@xmath61 , have almost no impact on the measured dispersion . larger expansion begin to show systematic effects that we want to avoid ( particularly at low @xmath57 ) .",
    "these blanked cubes minimize the effect of artifacts in the things cubes and yield a more robust estimate of kinetic energy than fitting an assumed line profile .",
    "therefore , the profiles of @xmath55 and @xmath62 represent the best possible estimates using the available data . however , we emphasize that a rigorous attempt to match other observations or simulations to our measurements should bear in mind ( and ideally duplicate or simulate ) this blanking procedure .      with the moment definition of @xmath5  and @xmath18 , the h@xmath0i  kinetic energy per unit area",
    "is given by @xmath63 , where the factor 3/2 takes into account all three velocity components assuming that the velocity dispersion is isotropic .",
    "for the galaxies with molecular gas maps , we define the total kinetic energy as @xmath64 . in   [ sec : results ]  we describe the relationship between the h@xmath0i  ( or h@xmath0i  +  h@xmath25 ) gas kinetic energy @xmath62 and the @xmath41  maps in a pixel - by - pixel scatter plot .",
    "we use maps of sfr surface density , @xmath41 , derived by @xcite , from combining the 24  @xmath34 m  and the fuv emission maps taken from the sings and the galex - ngs surveys (   [ sec : data ] ) .",
    "@xcite  have calibrated the sfr represented by the uv and ir emission by comparing these maps to h@xmath65 , 24  @xmath34 m , and pa@xmath65 emission from h@xmath0ii  regions  and young compact stellar clusters @xcite .",
    "the 24  @xmath34 m  band emission is mostly radiation from hot dust heated by the uv light from young massive stars and therefore traces dust - enshrouded , ongoing star formation over a time scale @xmath66  myr @xcite , although part of the emission proceeds from outside the h@xmath0ii  regions , thus tracing older ( @xmath67  myr ) stellar populations .",
    "fuv emission is mostly photospheric emission from o and b stars .",
    "it thus complements the 24  @xmath34 m  emission in regions poor in dust content , probing therefore low - metallicity and older regions of star formation over timescales of @xmath68  myr @xcite .",
    "the calibration provides sfr estimates with an uncertainty of 40% at most at high sfr , depending on variations in geometry , dust temperature , and age of stellar populations @xcite . at low sfr , a substantial part of the 24  @xmath34 m  emission proceeds from diffuse dust in the ism , which may not be associated directly to recent star formation , with the dust being heated by nearby ( young and old ) star clusters .",
    "@xcite argue that below a fiducial threshold of @xmath69 the sfr maps represent upper limits to the true sfr because of the contribution of this diffuse dust component .",
    "in this section we describe our two main results : ( 1 ) the observation that a radial decline of the h@xmath0i  velocity dispersion is pervasive throughout the entire sample with little dependence on galaxy type ; and ( 2 ) that we find correlation between the kinetic energy of gas and sfr with a slope close to unity and a similar proportionality constant in all objects .",
    "both results depend on the exceptional quality of the data in terms of spatial and velocity resolution and the wide field of view .",

    "<S> we explore what dominant physical mechanism sets the kinetic energy contained in neutral , atomic ( h@xmath0i ) gas . </S>",
    "<S> supernova ( sn ) explosions and magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) have both been proposed to drive turbulence in gas disks and we compare the h@xmath0i  line widths predicted from turbulence driven by these mechanisms to direct observations in 11 disk galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we use high - quality maps of the h@xmath0i  mass surface density and line width , obtained by the things survey . </S>",
    "<S> we show that all sample galaxies exhibit a systematic radial decline in the h@xmath0i  line width , which appears to be a generic property of h@xmath0i  disks and also implies a radial decline in kinetic energy density of h@xmath0i . at a galactocentric radius of @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S>  often comparable to the extent of significant star - formation  </S>",
    "<S> there is a characteristic value of the hi velocity dispersion of @xmath2  @xmath3 . inside this radius , </S>",
    "<S> galaxies show h@xmath0i  line widths well above the thermal value ( corresponding to @xmath4  @xmath3 ) expected from a warm h@xmath0i  component , implying that turbulence drivers must be responsible for maintaining this line width . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we compare maps of h@xmath0i  kinetic energy to maps of the star formation rate ( sfr )  a proxy for the sn rate  and to predictions for energy generated by mri . we find a positive correlation between kinetic energy of h@xmath0i  and sfr </S>",
    "<S> ; this correlation also holds at fixed @xmath5 , as expected if sne were driving turbulence . for a given turbulence dissipation timescale </S>",
    "<S> we can estimate the energy input required to maintain the observed kinetic energy . </S>",
    "<S> the sn rate implied by the observed recent sfr is sufficient to maintain the observed velocity dispersion , if the sn feedback efficiency is at least @xmath6 , assuming @xmath7  yr for the turbulence dissipation timescale . </S>",
    "<S> beyond @xmath1 , this efficiency would have to increase to unrealistic values , @xmath8 , suggesting that mechanical energy input from young stellar populations does not supply most kinetic energy in outer disks . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , both thermal broadening and turbulence driven by mri can plausibly produce the velocity dispersions and kinetic energies that we observe in this regime ( @xmath9 ) . </S>"
