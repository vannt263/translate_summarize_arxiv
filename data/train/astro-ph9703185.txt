    "flat cosmological models with a cosmological constant are currently serious candidates to describe the dynamics of the universe .",
    "there are three main reasons for the present interest on these models .",
    "first , they can reconcile inflation with dynamic estimates for the density parameter ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "observations indicate @xmath16 for matter that clumps on scales @xmath17 mpc , while inflationary models usually predict @xmath18 .",
    "second , these models , when normalized by data from the cosmic background explorer ( cobe ) predict less power in the perturbation spectrum at small scales than standard cold dark matter ( cdm ) , in accordance with observations @xcite . the third motivation for introducing a cosmological constant is the `` age crisis . '' in flat models with @xmath19 only if @xmath20 ( @xmath21 is the present value of the hubble parameter in units of @xmath22 km / s mpc@xmath23 ) is it possible to get theoretical ages for the universe that are higher than the lowest values ( @xmath24 gyear ) estimated for the galactic globular cluster system @xcite .",
    "however , current estimates based on observations of cepheids stars in the virgo cluster and type ia supernovae indicate higher values for @xmath21 @xcite .    in the past",
    "the cosmological constant was introduced and , with the improvement of the observational data , later discarded .",
    "now , however , the situation may change . by taking into account the vacuum contribution to the energy - momentum tensor",
    "we can define an effective cosmological constant ( @xmath25 ) that is the sum of two terms , the bare cosmological term and @xmath26 ( @xmath27 is the vacuum energy density ) . from quantum field theory",
    "we should expect @xmath28 ( @xmath29 is the planck mass ) , or perhaps another energy density related to some spontaneous symmetry - breaking scale such as @xmath30 or @xmath31 to the fourth power .",
    "the problem lies in that these values are enormous when compared with astronomical bounds for @xmath32 .",
    "extreme fine - tuning between @xmath33 and the bare @xmath0 is necessary to make theory compatible with observations .",
    "one possible explanation for a small @xmath0 term is to assume that it is dynamically evolving and not constant , that is , as the universe evolves from an earlier hotter and denser epoch , the effective cosmological term also evolves and decreases to its present value @xcite .",
    "there are also strong observational motivations for considering cosmological models with a decreasing @xmath0 term instead of a constant one .",
    "usually in a dynamical-@xmath0 cosmological model , the distance to an object with redshift @xmath34 is smaller than the distance to the same object in a constant-@xmath0 model with the same value of the density parameter . as we shall discuss in sec .",
    "iv , this implies that constraints coming from lensing statistics and from high redshift supernovae can be considerably weaker in these models @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite we suggested a class of models in which @xmath0 decreases as @xmath1 [ here @xmath2 is the scale factor of the friedman - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric and @xmath3 is a constant ( @xmath35 ) ] .",
    "although chen and wu @xcite gave some interesting arguments favoring the special value @xmath36 , it is clear that the above functional dependence with the scale factor is only phenomenological and does not come from particle physics first principles .",
    "however , we believe it deserves further investigation for the following reasons .",
    "first , these models generalize several other models present in the literature .",
    "so , by investigating their properties we are studying at once the models they generalize .",
    "second , since @xmath37 the universe age in these models is always larger than the age obtained in the standard einstein ",
    "de sitter cosmology and if @xmath38 the age is larger than the one we get in an open model with the same @xmath39 .",
    "this is an important aspect if we are interested in solving the `` age problem . ''",
    "further , since @xmath40 the @xmath41 term is generally not important during the radiation - dominated phase and nucleosynthesis proceed as in the standard model @xcite .",
    "finally , the models are mathematically simple and in most cases can be treated analytically .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii the basic equations of the models are obtained and our main assumptions presented . in sec .",
    "iii we investigate the effect of the @xmath0 term on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy and compute the angular power spectrum for small values of @xmath42 for different values of the parameter @xmath3 and @xmath7 .",
    "constraints on the models from high redshift sne ia and from lensing statistics are obtained in sec .",
    "in this paper we consider spatially flat , homogeneous , and isotropic cosmologies with a time - dependent @xmath0 term : @xmath43 here the parameters @xmath44 and @xmath3 are restricted to the range @xmath4 , @xmath45 and the factor 3 was only introduced for mathematical convenience .",
    "we consider the cosmic fluid to be a mixture of nonrelativistic matter and radiation ( @xmath46 ) with a perfect fluid energy momentum tensor , @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the total energy density ( radiation plus nonrelativistic matter ) and @xmath49 is the thermodynamic pressure .    as in ref .",
    "@xcite we assume that vacuum decays only into relativistic particles , such that the nonrelativistic matter energy momentum tensor is conserved ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "the radiation energy density has two parts : one conserved , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and a second one , @xmath53 , which arises due to the vacuum decay .",
    "here @xmath54 is the present value of the scale factor and @xmath55 is the present value of the hubble parameter . in the following , subscripts",
    "@xmath56 will always indicate present values .",
    "the einstein equations for the models we are considering reduce to two equations : namely , @xmath57 and @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the matter density parameter and @xmath60 .",
    "the above equations are quite general and apply for a broad spectrum of models . for instance , if @xmath61 , the usual flat frw model with a cosmological constant is obtained . if we take @xmath36 , eqs .",
    "( 2.3 ) and ( 2.4 ) assume the same form of the einstein equations for open models and also appear in some string - dominated cosmologies @xcite .",
    "further , we would obtain the _ same _ einstein equations if , instead of a cosmological term , we would have considered ( beside conserved matter and radiation ) an exotic x fluid with equation of state , @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "all we discuss here also applies for these cosmologies and to emphasize this point in the following we shall use the expression `` x component '' to interchangeably designate the @xmath0 term or the x fluid .",
    "the evolution of perturbations in the models we are considering may be studied considering two different phases @xcite . for @xmath63 , the energy density of the universe",
    "is dominated by radiation and/or matter , and the contribution from the x component may be neglected . during the second phase , characterized by @xmath64 , the energy density of the universe",
    "is dominated by nonrelativistic matter and/or the x component . in this phase ,",
    "the x component contribution becomes more and more important and the deviations from the usual matter - dominated cosmological model increase as the universe expands .    to describe the perturbation growth in these two phases , we consider the usual linear perturbation theory . each fourier component of the perturbation , @xmath65 , grows independently of the other modes and",
    "may be related to the primordial power spectrum with the help of the transfer function : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the primordial spectrum , usually taken to be @xmath68    in ( 3.1 ) @xmath69 is the transfer function , which incorporates all deformations undergone by the @xmath70-mode perturbation and @xmath71 may be any time @xmath72 .",
    "if the initial perturbation is adiabatic and @xmath73 we have a primordial scale invariant adiabatic perturbation that is usually predicted by inflationary models .",
    "in fact , for flat models without a cosmological constant it can be shown that , in this case , the quantity @xmath74 at @xmath75 , is independent of @xmath70 for any @xmath70 . here",
    ", @xmath76 is the instant when the perturbation crosses the hubble radius .",
    "however , this is not necessarily true if we have a cosmological term . in @xcite",
    "we adopted a true scale invariant harrison - zeldovich spectrum for the models we are analyzing . here",
    "we shall use the primordial scale invariant spectrum as defined above .",
    "the power spectrum is defined in the standard way by @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the present time .",
    "for flat models with @xmath79 , and after radiation - matter equality @xmath80 , all modes , inside and outside the hubble radius , evolve in the very same way .",
    "so , @xmath65 , in fact , does not experience any deformation for @xmath81 and @xmath82 reflects the power spectrum for any @xmath81 . since in our model @xmath83 , the evolution during the first phase , dominated by radiation and matter ,",
    "may be described by simply taking the standard power spectrum at @xmath84 , with the transfer function as computed by bond and efstathiou @xcite : @xmath85 where @xmath86 mpc , @xmath87 mpc , @xmath88 mpc , and @xmath89 .    after radiation and x component equality , @xmath64 , the increasingly importance of the x component energy density",
    "must be taken into account . to describe the perturbations after @xmath90",
    ", we consider the evolution of matter perturbations in the background dominated by matter and the x component .",
    "we shall use the approximation that the x component is smooth . in this case",
    "it can be shown @xcite that all modes , inside and outside the hubble radius , grow at the same rate as in a flat universe dominated by nonrelativistic particles .",
    "so again no extra deformation is introduced in the power spectrum by the presence of the x component and , to study the multipole expansion of the power spectrum , we are allowed to use the transfer function given by eq .",
    "( 3.3 ) .    since one of our goals",
    "is to understand the effect of the decaying cosmological term ( x component ) on the cmb anisotropy , we consider the relation between the mass density perturbation and the fractional perturbation to the cmb temperature @xmath91 .",
    "almost 30 years ago , sachs and wolfe @xcite obtained the expression relating fluctuations in the gravitational potential on the last scattering surface with cmb temperature anisotropies on large angular scales ( @xmath92 ) . for a flat universe",
    "their formula can be written as @xcite @xmath93^{t_{ob}}_{t_{em } } - \\left[\\frac{a}{2}\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(a\\frac{dd}{dt}\\right)k \\right ] ^{t_{ob}}_{t_{em } }   \\nonumber \\\\   & + & \\frac12 \\int^{t_{ob}}_{t_{em } } dt k \\frac{d}{dt}a \\frac{d}{dt}a\\frac{dd}{dt } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath94 describes the time dependence of the growing mode of @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 is the unit vector pointing along a null ray from the observer to the source , and where @xmath98 is given by    @xmath99    the first term in the right - hand side ( rhs ) of ( 3.4 ) describes the anisotropy caused by the relative motion source observer .",
    "the effect of the observer s motion may be systematically removed from the experimental data , and will not be considered any further .",
    "the effect of the source motion is a doppler contribution related to velocity perturbations on the last scattering surface and can not be eliminated .",
    "the second term in eq .",
    "( 3.4 ) includes the usual sachs - wolfe effect ( sw ) and a constant part evaluated at the present epoch which does not contribute to the observed anisotropy .",
    "finally , there is the last term , usually called the integrated sachs - wolfe effect ( isw ) , which represents the redshift or blueshift of the photon energy caused by its traveling through regions of space with time - varying gravitational potential .",
    "note that during the radiation - matter domination phase the growing modes behave as @xcite @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the scale factor at matter - radiation energy density equality .",
    "so , since in flat models , during the radiation domination , we have @xmath102 , and during matter domination the scale factor grows as @xmath103 , it is easy to see that the contribution of the last term in eq . ( 3.4 ) vanishes in both cases .",
    "this reflects the fact that , during these eras , the gravitational potential is time independent .",
    "however , during the x component domination , the gravitational potential will not be constant and the isw term will no longer be zero .",
    "in fact its contribution may be of the same order of the usual sw term for the lower modes in the harmonic expansion . in order to study the cmb anisotropies in the models described above , we keep three contributions in the rhs of ( 3.4 ) : sw , isw , and doppler .",
    "the full temperature correlation function is defined by @xmath104 where @xmath105 ...",
    "@xmath106 denotes an average over all positions @xmath107 and all directions @xmath108 , @xmath109 separated by an angle @xmath110 .    to compute the average value in eq .",
    "( 3.7 ) , we first analyze the isw contribution @xcite .",
    "we have @xmath111 here @xmath112and @xmath113 where @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "note that if @xmath61 and @xmath116 we obtain @xmath117 .",
    "equation ( 3.8 ) was obtained by making use of the field eqs .",
    "( 2.3 ) and ( 2.4 ) , with @xmath118 , and the time evolution differential equation for @xmath119 , @xmath120 by using that , @xmath121 and @xmath122 ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath123 , we reduce ( 3.8 ) to @xmath124 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath125 .",

    "calculations are done in a semianalytical way through the following steps . to make the integration in @xmath148 [ eq . ( 3.25 ) ] , we change variables . by defining @xmath149 , and by using an interpolated polynomial ,",
    "we rewrite the integral in the new @xmath150 variable as @xmath151.\\ ] ] here @xmath152 is an interpolated polynomial , which replaces the function @xmath153 , where @xmath154 stands for the inverse of @xmath149 .",
    "the precision of this interpolation may be estimated by comparing @xmath152 and the original function @xmath155 . in the models we consider",
    ", this comparison shows that using the seventh - order interpolated polynomial , @xmath156 , introduces an error always smaller than @xmath157 . with the help of this approximation ,",
    "the resulting seven integrals in @xmath158 can be analytically computed .",
    "the form of these expressions remains the same for all models that we want to consider .",
    "changing among models only changes the numerical values of @xmath159 together with the upper limit in the integral , @xmath160 .",
    "once we have calculated these auxiliary functions @xmath161 , we may compute the coefficients in eqs .",
    "( 3.24 ) , ( 3.28 ) , and ( 3.30 ) by direct integration in @xmath70 . in the limit @xmath162 ,",
    "the integrand is well behaved . for large values of @xmath70 ,",
    "the integrand decreases very fast .",
    "however , while decreasing , these integrands oscillate wildly , making the integral procedure slower and slower .",
    "to avoid this technical difficulty , we truncate the integral at some value of @xmath70 , and we certify ourselves that the truncation is affecting our results in a controlled way . for values of @xmath70 larger than the truncation value , we compute the integrals replacing the oscillating @xmath163 by an envelope function , and the result of these integrals is taken as an upper bound of the error introduced by the truncation in @xmath70 .",
    "this error grows steadily with @xmath42 , starting with @xmath164 for @xmath165 and growing up to the range @xmath166 for @xmath6 and different values of @xmath3 .",
    "the numerical results obtained with the method described above are plotted in figs . @xmath167 and @xmath168 .    in fig .",
    "@xmath168 we plot for @xmath36 and @xmath169 the separate contributions from the sachs - wolfe , doppler and integrated sachs - wolfe effects . crossed terms are not shown .",
    "basically , in the range @xmath170 , the sachs - wolfe contribution remains always important , with a slight decrease .",
    "the integrated sachs - wolfe is large for small values of @xmath42 , but soon it becomes unimportant , reducing to just @xmath171 of @xmath172 at @xmath6 . on the other hand ,",
    "the doppler contribution starts very small and grows fast to become the dominant contribution at @xmath6 .",
    "for the analyzed models , the curves @xmath173",
    "@xmath174 @xmath42 in fig .",
    "@xmath167 , show a common feature , a minimum for small values of @xmath42 .",
    "we see that , for fixed @xmath7 and @xmath21 , the position of this minimum changes with @xmath3 , becoming deeper as @xmath3 grows larger .",
    "this feature reflects the fact that the contribution from the isw effect is larger for larger values of the parameter @xmath3 .",
    "we also observe that for fixed @xmath3 and @xmath21 and different values of the matter content , the minimum grows deeper for smaller values of @xmath7 .",
    "again this feature agrees with the fact that it is the x component term which brings up the nonzero isw effect , which , by its turn , makes the minimum deeper .",
    "so , since @xmath175 , less nonrelativistic matter means more x component contribution , more isw effect , and consequently deeper minimum .",
    "the supernovae cosmology project is an ongoing program to systematically search and study high - z supernovae . in a recent report @xcite perlmutter _",
    "et al . _ analyzed seven sne ( with redshift @xmath176 ) , of more than 28 supernovae discovered , and obtained constraints on cosmological parameters , specially on the cosmological constant .",

    "we use their observational results and adapt their procedure to constraint the class of models described in sec .",
    "the basic idea is to use type ia supernovae as standard candles for the classic magnitude - redshift test . as in @xcite",

    "recently progress was made in the study of their inhomogeneities .",
