    "recent studies have seen increasing understandings of _ global _ characteristics of geophysical flows on earth and giant planets in the solar system .",
    "simulations and observations have persistently shown that coherent anisotropy favoring _ zonal flows _ appears ubiquitously in planet scale circulations .",
    "for a partial list of computational results , we mention @xcite for 3d models , @xcite for 2d models , and references therein .",
    "these highly resolved , eddy - permitting simulations are made possible by rapid developements of high performance computing . on the other hand ,",
    "we have observed zonal flow patterns ( bands and jets ) on giant planets for hundreds of years , which has attracted considerable interests recently thanks to spacecraft missions and the launch of the hubble space telescope ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "figure 1 shows a composite view of the banded strucure of jovian atmosphere captured by the cassini spacecraft ( @xcite ) .",
    "there are also observational data in the oceans on earth showing persistent zonal flow patterns ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "[ remark : intro ] in the existing literature , a necessary process for the zonal flow pattern to emerge is averaging of data and/or simulations over a period of time usually decades long .",
    "also , a number of heuristic arguments ( e.g. @xcite ) are made pointing to the north - south gradient of coriolis parameter as the underlying machanism , even in the absence of temperature / density gradient and vertical variability .    to this end , we study inviscid , barotropic geophysical flows on a unit sphere @xmath0 centered at the origin of @xmath1 and fast rotating about the @xmath2-axis with constant angular velocity .",
    "let vector field @xmath3 , tangent to @xmath0 at every point @xmath4 , denote the fluid velocity _ relative _ to this rotating frame . throughout this paper ,",
    "we represent any point @xmath5 either by its relative - to - the - frame cartesian coordinates @xmath6 or its relative - to - the - frame spherical coordinates @xmath7 with @xmath8 being the colatitude and @xmath9 the longitude , we fix @xmath10 but @xmath9 can be arbitrary . such singularity issue does not occur for cartesian coordinates @xmath11 . ] .",
    "also , let @xmath12 be the unit vector in the zonal direction of increasing longitude and @xmath13 be the unit vector in the meridional direction of increasing colatitude .    in this study , we focus on a canonical pde system : the incompressible euler equations under the coriolis force ( @xcite),[euler : vec]+_+p = z,=0 where constant @xmath14 , called the rossby number , scales like the frequency of the frame s rotation ( usually @xmath15 at a global scale ) , and @xmath16 denotes a counterclockwise @xmath17-rotation of @xmath18 on @xmath0 .",
    "cartesian coordinate @xmath2 indicates how the coriolis parameter varies along the meridional direction .",
    "note that the coriolis force is not uniformly large and actually vanishes on the equator .",
    "it is the large _ gradient _ of the coriolis parameter that drives the zonal flow patterns .",
    "note that results have been established concerning solution regularity of the above systems and related ones in the fast rotating regime with @xmath19 .",
    "please refer to @xcite and references therein for further discussion .",
    "our theoretical investigation is then focused on the fast rotating regime with @xmath19 and in particular , the nature of the _ time - averages _ of @xmath18 : [ def : umean](t,):=1t_0^t(t,)dtfor positive times @xmath20 .",

    "the time - averaged flow @xmath23 is only @xmath32 away from a very restricted subspace consisting of * longitude - independent zonal flows*. the initial data , on the other hand , do not need any filtering and can be arbitrarily far away from that subspace of zonal flows .",
    "our proofs below will suggest that such unique pattern is essentially due to the coriolis parameter @xmath33 that varies meridionally from the strongest at the poles to zero on the equator .",
    "rossby number @xmath14 is typically at magnitude 0.01@xmath340.1 for earth oceans , which results in a time scale of magnitude 10@xmath34100 earth days according to theorem [ thm : zonal ] .",
    "this suggests that zonal flow patterns can occur at time scales far below those used in the literature .",

    "the rest of the paper is organized as following .",
    "we start section 2 with describing a version of the hodge decomposition in terms of differential operators on @xmath0 .",
    "the definitions of these operators are given the appendix .",
    "an elliptic operator @xmath39 that plays the same role as the @xmath39 in lemma [ lemma : abstract ] is defined by the end of section 2 . in section 3 , we characterize the null space of @xmath39 , identifying @xmath49 as the space of longitude - independent zonal flows ( c.f .",
    "lemma [ null : cl : zonal ] ) .",
    "we also define the projection operator @xmath47 and its complement . in section 4 , we obtain sobolev - type estimates , in particual , regarding @xmath39 and @xmath47 using the spherical coordinates and spherical harmonics . in appendix",
    "a , we give the rigorous definitions of differential operators on surfaces such as @xmath0 and prove related properties .",
    "it is necessary to adopt coordinate - independent differential geometric tools since any global coordinate system on @xmath0 is bound to have singularity issues . on the other hand , one can formally use spherical coordinates as well as cartesian coordinates for most of the arguments presented in this paper , knowing their validity is justified . in appendix b ,",
    "we prove an @xmath14-independent estimates after carefully examining commutability properties of some differential - integral operators on a sphere .",
    "the * hodge decomposition * theorem ( @xcite , @xcite ) confirms that for any @xmath60-form @xmath61 on an oriented compact riemannian manifold , there exist a @xmath62-form @xmath63 , @xmath64-form @xmath65 and a harmonic @xmath60-form @xmath66 , s.t .",
    "@xmath67    in particular , if the manifold is a surface in the cohomology class of @xmath0 ( loosely speaking , there is no `` hole '' or `` handle '' ) , then there exist two scalar - valued functions @xmath68 ( called potential ) and @xmath69 ( called stream function ) such that [ hodge : vec]=+:=:=.please refer to in the appendix and the discussion that leads to it .",
    "moreover , the decomposition satisfies @xmath70and[irr : inc ] = _ ^-1,=_^-1.in other words , any ( square - integrable ) vector field on @xmath0 can be written as superposition of an incompressible and an irrotational vector fields that are determined by .",
    "such decomposition is unique because a harmonic scalar - valued function on a sphere ( and any surface in the same cohomology class ) is always constant and therefore @xmath71 is unique up to a constant .    for simplicity",

    ", the incompressible part @xmath76 is uniquely determined by [ euler : proj]=(z - _ ) .",
    "this is indeed an equivalent formulation of the original incompressible euler s equation .",

    "therefore , by and , the null space of @xmath39 is identified as [ null : cl:1],=0(z)=0 .",
    "since @xmath88 is in the meridional direction , implies any @xmath18 in the null space of @xmath39 flows in the zonal direction .",

    "thus , we arrive at the conclusion .",
    "the very last term in is due to the fact that , in spherical coodinates , @xmath91    it is then easy to show the following characterization of @xmath47 , the @xmath79-orthogonal - projection operator onto @xmath49 .",

    "several remarks are in order .",
    "first , among all possible projection operators , we chose one that nullifies the @xmath95 orthogonal complement of @xmath49 .",
    "secondly , intuitively , @xmath96 at a given latitude is a uniform zonal flow equal to the mean circulation of @xmath18 at that latitude ; thus , @xmath97 is of zero circulation along the circle at a fixed latitude .",
