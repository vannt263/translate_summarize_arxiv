    "the role of stable and unstable manifolds in demarcating flow barriers in unsteady flows is well documented .",
    "determining their location in a given unsteady flow regime is a problem which has attracted considerable attention , with many techniques continually being developed and refined in order to improve accuracy and efficiency @xcite .    viewing this problem from the reverse viewpoint leads to an intriguing question : is it possible to force stable and unstable manifolds to lie along _ user - defined , time - varying locations _ ?",
    "the time - variation here is arbitrarily specified , and _ not _ confined to the popular time - periodic situation . if possible , this would yield an invaluable tool in controlling transport in micro- and nano - fluidic devices , with innumerable applications .",
    "this article answers this question in a specific setting : that of a nonautonomously perturbed two - dimensional system , in which the issue is to determine the nonautonomous perturbation which gives rise to the primary parts of the stable and unstable manifolds lying along prescribed one - dimensional curves at each instance in time . the theory is couched in terms of the perturbation being @xmath0 , and results ensuring that the prescribed manifolds are achieved to leading - order in @xmath1 are presented . rigorous bounds for the errors in the manifolds are also established .",
    "the derived control strategy is tested on a time - aperiodic modification of the taylor - green flow @xcite .",
    "numerical diagnostics are compared with the prescribed stable manifolds , and excellent results are obtained .",
    "while the method developed in this article is confined to perturbations of autonomous flows , it is to our knowledge the first theoretical contribution towards developing a control strategy for stable and unstable manifolds in nonautonomous flows . as such",
    ", it may serve as an important initial step towards building a more complete theory for the nonautonomous control of flow barriers .",
    "consider for @xmath2 , a two - dimensional open connected set , the system @xmath3 in which @xmath4 , and sufficient smoothness will be assumed ( to be characterised shortly ) .    the system ( [ eq : unp ] ) possesses a saddle fixed point @xmath5 , that is , @xmath6 and @xmath7 possesses real eigenvalues @xmath8 and @xmath9 such that @xmath10 .",

    "@xmath72 approaches the saddle fixed point @xmath5 , and therefore the length of the restricted stable manifold in each time - slice gets shorter .",
    "in other words , the restrictions implied in ( [ eq : unpmanifolds ] ) results are actually associated with shorter and shorter segments of the stable manifold as time gets larger .",

    "the stable manifold in the time - slice @xmath60 is the curve segment ( heavy magenta curve ) which connects together all five starting points . in time - slices @xmath66 as time evolves , all trajectories get closer together ( indeed , they get closer to the dashed hyperbolic trajectory @xmath75 ) , which means that the restricted stable manifold are becoming curves of smaller and smaller length in each time - slice .",
