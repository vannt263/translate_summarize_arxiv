    "various endogenous biological rhythms in our body such as heartbeats and sleep - waking cycles of about 24-hour period , the so - called circadian rhythm , function in our body .",
    "unexpectedly , these rhythms maintain time regularly .",
    "for example , the daily onset of activity in mice has a standard deviation of a few minutes even in the absence of environmental information .",
    "these biological rhythms are generated by pacemaker organs composed of a network of autonomously oscillatory cells .",
    "how do biological cells generate highly precise rhythms despite internal and external noise present in each cell ? we know , experimentally , that an isolated cell can not generate such precise oscillation , but a network of coupled cells can .",
    "regularity in oscillations increases with the number of cells that constitute the network .",
    "this effect is called the collective enhancement of temporal precision . in this study , we present a new theory for quantifying temporal precision in terms of network parameters including the number of cells , connectivity , and coupling strength .",
    "our main finding is that the collective enhancement is ineffective beyond a certain cell number , and this number increases with coupling strength among cells .",
    "our theory provides a useful tool for inferring the properties of cell networks .",
    "biological rhythms such as heartbeats and sleep - waking cycles are essential in living organisms .",
    "many biological rhythms are generated by pacemaker organs composed of autonomously rhythmic cells .",
    "for example , the heart pacemaker ( i.e. , the sinoatrial node ) is the source of electric waves propagating from within the heart , which cause the contraction of cardiac cells @xcite the suprachiasmatic nucleus ( scn ) , which is a network of clock cells located in the brain , orchestrates the circadian ( i.e. , approximately 24 h ) activity of the entire body .",
    "each clock cell has a circadian rhythm in its electric activity owing to the gene regulatory network within the cell , and a population of clock cells synchronizes its activity through neural interactions @xcite .",
    "the medullary pacemaker nucleus in electric fish is the pacemaker for the electric discharges emitted by electric fish , which are used for object detection and communication with other electric fish @xcite .",
    "cell dynamics involve fluctuations resulting from various types of internal and external noise .",
    "however , oscillations in pacemaker organs such as the sinoatrial node in the heart , the scn , and the medullary pacemaker nucleus in electric fish are highly precise . for example , the daily onset of activity in certain mammals and birds has a standard deviation ( sd ) of a few minutes even in the absence of environmental information @xcite .",
    "in addition , the electric organ discharge pattern in certain electric fish has a standard deviation of as little as @xmath4 of the average period @xcite .",
    "experiments by clay and dehaan provided an important clue for understanding the mechanisms underlying precise oscillations was provided by @xcite .",
    "they prepared clusters of cultivated cardiac cells , ranging in size from @xmath5 to @xmath6@xmath7 , and observed the beatings of individual cells .",
    "they found that the sd of inter - beat intervals decreases with the number of component cells in the cluster ( @xmath0 ) roughly as @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , precision in individual cell oscillations is enhanced as the number of cells increases . note",
    "that this scaling , which is reminiscent of the central limit theorem , is not at all trivial .",
    "this is because oscillators are synchronized and thus strongly correlated , while the central limit theorem is applicable to an ensemble of independent elements .",
    "the decrease in sd as @xmath0 increases , the so - called collective enhancement of temporal precision , has attracted considerable attention @xcite .",
    "there is a large body of experimental @xcite , numerical @xcite , and analytical @xcite studies .",
    "theoretically , it has been shown thatthe average activity of all oscillators on the all - to - all network ( i.e. , the complete graph ) obeys @xmath8 @xcite . however , most analytical studies are based on rather strong assumptions about coupling topology ( e.g. , all - to - all ) or coupling mechanism ( e.g. , gap - junction type ) .",
    "moreover , little is known about temporal precision in single cell activity or ensemble activity for a subset of cells in an entire network . note that in the experiments by clay and dehaan , the behavior @xmath8 was found for single cells and not for the entire network @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a general theoretical framework that enables us to understand the dependence of temporal precision on network parameters , including size , connectivity , and coupling intensity .",
    "our framework , based on a phase oscillator model , allows us to handle directed and weighted networks , various coupling mechanisms , and temporal precision in the activity of single cells and arbitrary subsets of cells .",
    "we begin by describing the numerical results for two biological pacemaker models : network of the fitzhugh - nagumo oscillators and that of circadian oscillators .",
    "these models have distinct oscillation and coupling mechanisms . for different networks including all - to - all coupling , lattices with nearest - neighbor coupling , and the random graph",
    ", we observe that there is a common dependence of temporal precision on network size @xmath0 .",
    "the sd of cycle - to - cycle periods decreases as @xmath1 in small networks , but approaches an asymptotic value as @xmath0 increases .",
    "that is , there is a crossover .",
    "then , we develop a theory for obtaining an explicit expression for the sd of the cycle - to - cycle period .",
    "in particular , we find the condition for the behavior @xmath9 and the dependence of the crossover point @xmath2 on network parameters .",
    "we also demonstrate the advantage of long - range interactions among cells to temporal precision .",
    "finally , we discuss the implications of our theory .",
    "first , we present the numerical results for two mathematical models describing biological oscillations ( see * methods * for the details of the models ) .",
    "we used fhn oscillators with gap - junction coupling as a model of oscillatory cardiac or neural cells .",
    "we also employed a previously proposed model for the scn ( i.e. , a population of circadian clock cells ) @xcite , which is referred to as the scn model .",
    "figures  [ fig : waveforms](a , c , e ) and ( b , d , f ) present the waveforms obtained from the fhn and scn models of different network sizes , respectively .",
    "the average cycle - to - cycle periods are depicted by dotted lines in each panel to illuminate the variations in cycle - to - cycle periods .",
    "the properties of each constituent cell were kept constant , while the connectivity between the cells is different .",
    "typical waveforms of uncoupled cells ( @xmath10 ) are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : waveforms](a , b ) . when the cells are coupled sufficiently strongly , the system synchronizes stably ( figs .  [",
    "fig : waveforms](c , d ) ) . figures  [ fig : waveforms](c , d ) indicate that waveforms in the presence of coupling are regularized as compared to the waveforms of isolated cells [ figs .",
    "[ fig : waveforms](a , b ) ] .",
    "in particular , the variation in the cycle - to - cycle period decreases .",
    "when 100 oscillators are coupled [ figs .",
    "[ fig : waveforms](e , f ) ] , the variation appears to be even smaller . when cells are coupled , individual cell oscillations are not only synchronized but also regularized , and the oscillation appears to be more regular for a larger system size .      to quantify the dependence of temporal precision on network parameters , we measured the coefficient of variation ( cv ) , which is the sd of the cycle - to - cycle period divided by the mean period .",
    "a cycle - to - cycle period is defined by an interval @xmath11 between two successive passages of an observed variable ( @xmath12 ) across a specified threshold value @xmath13 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : time_series_dt ] ) .",
    "we set @xmath14 and @xmath15 for the fhn and scn models , respectively .",
    "we discard @xmath11 that is much smaller than a typical oscillation period to exclude noise - driven rapid threshold crossing .",
    "the cv is defined as @xmath16 where @xmath17 and sd are the mean and the sd of a series of @xmath11 , respectively .    here",
    "we investigate the fhn model on networks of different types and different sizes .",
    "we assume that the system is composed of identical cells subjected to weak noise .",
    "figure [ fig : fhn](a ) shows the cv of individual cell oscillations in the fhn model on the all - to - all network of size @xmath0 . the results for different coupling strength values , @xmath18 ,",
    "are plotted using different symbols .",
    "we find that    * cv is proportional to @xmath1 for small @xmath0 values for each @xmath18 * cv approaches a constant value for large @xmath0 values for each @xmath18 ; i.e. , there is a crossover * the crossover point @xmath2 increases with @xmath18 .",
    "we observe similar behavior for the square lattice and the random graph , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : fhn](b ) and ( c ) , respectively .      a natural question is whether the enhanced synchronization induces the collective enhancement of temporal precision . to examine this possibility , we measured the distance @xmath19 between the actual state and the in - phase state ( see * methods * for the definition of @xmath19 ) for the all - to - all network . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fhn](d ) , the level of synchrony is independent of @xmath0 for each @xmath18 value .",
    "we also confirmed that , in the fhn model on a square lattice , @xmath19 even increases with @xmath0 although the cv decreases ( results not shown ) .",
    "thus , the enhancement of temporal precision by an increase in @xmath0 is not attributed to the improvement in synchronization .      in nature , rhythmic output from a pacemaker organ",
    "is usually generated by an ensemble of multiple cells .",
    "for example , rhythmic electroactivity propagating within the heart is thought to originate from cells on the surface of the sinoatrial node .",
    "the scn consists of various neural populations , and each population forms a particular pattern of efferent projections to other parts of the brain @xcite .",
    "this anatomical fact suggests that the scn s output is generated by a combination of a subset of neurons rather than by the uniform average of the entire organ .",
    "therefore , we investigated the cv of the ensemble activity of a subset of cells on the all - to - all network .",
    "the ensemble activity is defined by the average waveform of @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) cells : @xmath22 where the measured ensemble is assumed to consist of oscillators @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "the cycle - to - cycle period and the cv for the ensemble activity are defined similarly to the case of single cell activity ( fig .",
    "[ fig : time_series_dt ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fhn_multi ] , we present the cv measured for the average waveform with different values of @xmath20 in the fhn model on the all - to - all network . for @xmath20",
    "smaller than @xmath0 , properties ( i)(iii ) listed above are preserved .",
    "in addition , we find that    * the crossover point @xmath2 increases with ensemble size @xmath20 * for @xmath26 , the cv is proportional to @xmath1 for any @xmath0 ; i.e. , there is no crossover .",
    "we also confirmed that the same properties hold true for the fhn model on two  dimensional lattices and for the scn model on the all - to - all network and the two  dimensional lattice .",
    "so far , we have assumed an ideal case : identical oscillators and weak noise . to simulate more realistic situations ,",
    "we now consider networks composed of heterogeneous cells subjected to relatively strong noise . as examples",

    "[ fig : hetero ] , all properties ( i)(v ) hold true .",

    "we develop a theory for relating temporal precision to network parameters by assuming weak coupling and weak noise . under this assumption , a large class of oscillator systems including the models considered above",

    ". such small eigenvalues do not exist in networks with a sufficient number of shortcuts because of rapid communication between any pair of oscillators .",
    "we demonstrated using various models that the crossover generally occurs in the collective enhancement . on the basis of our theory ,",
    "the crossover can be interpreted as follows . when jacobian @xmath81 is symmetric , the sd for the mean phase decreases as @xmath1 for any @xmath0 ( eq .  ) .",
    "when coupling strength @xmath18 is infinite , the oscillators are completely synchronized in phase .",
    "then , the phase of each oscillator is identical with the mean phase , and so is the sd , i.e. , @xmath205 for any @xmath0 .",
    "this behavior is expressed in the first term on the right - hand side of eq .  .",
    "however , for finite @xmath18 , individual oscillators phases fluctuate around the mean phase because of the independent noise applied to the oscillators . owing to this additional fluctuation ,",
    "the sd for individual oscillators is larger than that for the mean phase , as expressed in the second term on the right - hand side of eq .  .",
    "although the fluctuation in the mean phase vanishes with the limit @xmath206 , it remains finite in individual oscillators .",
    "this is the origin of the lower bound .",
    "we found that the collective enhancement is ineffective for system size @xmath0 above the crossover point @xmath2 .",
    "we further showed that @xmath2 increases with coupling strength ( eq .  ) .",
    "therefore , as oscillators are more strongly coupled , the behavior @xmath141 persists up to a larger @xmath0 value .",
    "this is the case for different oscillation and coupling mechanisms , as demonstrated in the two biological models ( the fhn and scn models ) and the phase oscillator model .",
    "moreover , this behavior also holds true for different network connectivities , as demonstrated using the ring , the square lattice , the all - to - all network , and the random graph .",
    "our theory is useful for inferring the magnitude of fluctuations in individual cells and the coupling strength between cells .",
    "suppose that temporal precision in a pacemaker tissue that is genetically modified or subjected to a treatment ( e.g. , drug ) is lower than that in an intact tissue .",
    "if the cells in the tissue are well synchronized in both cases , one may consider that the treatment affects the oscillation mechanism of individual cells .",
    "our theory suggests another possibility : a decrease in the coupling strength , not the alteration in the oscillation property of individual cells , may be the reason for the reduced temporal precision ( figs .",
    "[ fig : fhn](a , b , c ) ) . by observing reduced temporal precision only",
    ", we can not distinguish these two possibilities .",
    "however , our theory makes it possible to individually quantify the effects of the treatment on the two properties if we can observe cell networks of different sizes . by observing temporal precision in small ( i.e. , @xmath142 ) tissues of different sizes",
    ", we can infer the magnitude of fluctuations in individual cells by fitting the law @xmath141 .",
    "furthermore , by observing relatively large tissues and determining @xmath2 values for different treatments ( e.g. , different days of cultivation , different concentrations of a drug , treated versus untreated ) , we can infer changes in the coupling strength induced by the treatment because @xmath2 increases with the coupling strength ( eq .  ) .",
    "our study also indicates that long - range interactions among cells are advantageous to temporal precision . as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : sw ] , the addition of shortcut links considerably decreases the cv .",
    "a similar result was reported in a previous numerical study using a more realistic model for the scn @xcite .",
    "this result might underlie an evolutionary origin of dense fibers across the scn @xcite .",
    "our theoretical results provide an interpretation of previous experiments on cardiac and circadian oscillations .",
    "et al _ observed a decrease in the cv with increasing cell number in cultivated cardiac cells coupled via micro channels @xcite .",
    "they showed that the cv decreases considerably with @xmath0 for small @xmath0 values ( @xmath207 ) , while it is almost constant for @xmath208 .",
    "in contrast , in cultivated cardiac cells that are directly and tightly coupled to each other , clay and dehaan found that the reduction in the cv roughly obeys @xmath141 up to @xmath209 @xcite .",
    "although the cells are kept synchronized in both cases , the behavior of temporal precision is different .",
    "this discrepancy may be due to a difference in coupling strength .",
    "while the coupling was strong enough to guarantee synchrony in both cases , coupling in the latter experiments may be stronger than that in the former experiments , resulting in @xmath210 and @xmath211 , respectively .",
    "it would be of great interest to investigate systematically how the crossover point increases with coupling strength , possibly controlled by the width of the micro channel implemented in the former experiments @xcite .",
    "collective enhancement has been examined experimentally in circadian oscillation as well .",
    "et al _ measured temporal precision in scn cells @xcite .",
    "there , individual cell oscillations in both synchronized and unsynchronized cases were observed in slice cultures of scn and dispersed scn cells , respectively .",
    "they found that the sd in the former ( 0.42 h ) was approximately five times smaller than that in the latter ( 2.1 h ) , and argued that the collective enhancement of temporal precision occurs in synchronized cells .",
    "they further speculated that , under the assumption @xmath212 , only 25 cells out of the order of @xmath213 cells composing the scn are involved in the collective enhancement of temporal precision in the explant scn .",
    "we interpret this experimental result as follows . in the scn , a wave pattern is observed @xcite . as indicated above as well as in our previous paper @xcite , the law @xmath214 is violated in the presence of a wave pattern even if the coupling is sufficiently strong .",
    "roughly speaking , the reason for this is that only the cells forming the source of the wave pattern can contribute to the collective enhancement of temporal precision , and other cells simply obey those cells @xcite .",
    "the number of cells forming the source might be of the order of 25 .",
    "cells located downstream of the wave may contribute to functions other than temporal precision .",
    "our theory is widely applicable to frequency - synchronized oscillators with weak noise and weak coupling .",
    "our theory can also apply to the case of the coexistence of multiple coupling mechanisms , only by replacing coupling function @xmath215 by @xmath216 in the phase model ( eq .  ) .",
