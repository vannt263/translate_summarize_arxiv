    "the recent manufacture of a single atomic layer of graphite ( graphene ) has renewed interest in the transport properties of dirac fermions propagating in two - dimensional space .",

    ", confirming the result of ref .   and predicting sub - poissonian shot noise .    the conductivity has long been known to be related to a twist of boundary conditions .",

    "( see also ref .  )",
    "nonperturbative results of refs .   for the mean conductance and the density of transmission eigenvalues of quasi - one - dimensional disordered quantum wires for three symmetry classes of anderson localization .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to establish a connection between ( i ) the density of transmission eigenvalues of the noninteracting dirac hamiltonian describing the free ( ballistic ) propagation of a relativistic massless electron in two - dimensional space and ( ii ) twisted chiral partition functions of a combination ( tensor product ) of two conformal field theories ( cfts ) with central charges @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in this way we provide a complementary method for calculating the landauer conductance of a single massless dirac fermion which agrees with the direct calculations of refs .   and  , while it might give us a powerful tool to account for the nonperturbative effects for certain types of disorder .",
    "this connection comes from the observation that ideal leads attached to the sample , which are necessary to define the landauer conductance , can be replaced by a set of conformally invariant boundary conditions . that this is possible is a consequence of the `` diffusive '' nature of the ballistic dirac transport , as epitomized by its sub - poissonian shot noise , which in turn suggests an insensitivity to the modeling of ideal leads .",
    "the transport properties of noninteracting dirac fermions in two - dimensional space under ideal conditions , i.e. , without the breaking of translation invariance by disorder , have also been discussed in terms of the kubo formula . however , extracting the dc value of the conductivity from the kubo formula , which depends on frequency @xmath2 , temperature @xmath3 , and smearing @xmath4 ( imaginary part of the self - energy ) , is rather subtle , as it is known that the conductivity in the dc limit @xmath5 is sensitive to how one approaches the dc limit.@xcite there have been at least two known limiting procedures : the einstein conductivity , defined by first taking the zero temperature and then the zero frequency limits while keeping @xmath4 finite , is given by @xmath6 in units of @xmath7.@xcite on the other hand , by switching the order of zero smearing and zero frequency limits , one obtains , instead , @xmath8 for the dc conductivity ( again in units of @xmath7).@xcite    to clarify the origin of this sensitivity to how the dc limit is taken , we compute the ac kubo conductivity without taking any biased limit in @xmath2 , @xmath3 , or @xmath4 . due to the scale invariance of noninteracting dirac fermions , we show the kubo conductivity to be a scaling function of two scaling variables .",
    "we discuss several limiting procedures , including the above two , and clarify the relationship between different dc values .",
    "in particular , we demonstrate that , if we take the zero smearing limit prior to the other two limits , we can obtain any value between 0 and @xmath8 for the dc kubo conductivity .",
    "the einstein conductivity agrees with the conductivity determined from the landauer conductance .",
    "we also compute several asymptotic behaviors of the kubo conductivity that have not been obtained before .",
    "these considerations may be of relevance to experiments on graphene if different limiting procedures are accessed .",
    "the perturbative effects of disorder in the form of weak real - valued random ( white - noise ) hopping between nearest - neighbor sites of the honeycomb lattice at the band center are discussed .",
    "we show that , as a consequence of the fixed point theory discussed in ref .  , the einstein conductivity is an analytic function of the disorder strength .",
    "we also show that the first - order correction to the einstein conductivity vanishes , in agreement with a calculation performed by ostrovsky et al .  in ref .",
    "this result is of relevance to the two - dimensional chiral - orthogonal universality class.@xcite potential relationships of the two - dimensional chiral symmetry class with certain types of disorder in graphene were recently discussed in ref .   .",
