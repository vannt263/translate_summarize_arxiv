    "<S> analyzing the heat and charge transport in a thermoelectric by transport equations , and assuming a simple scaling between the current and the heat current densities , we evaluate @xmath0 and @xmath1 and find at low temperatures the universal law @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the deviations from the simple scaling law are also discussed and the results are used to analyze the effects of chemical pressure on @xmath3 in the eucu@xmath4(ge@xmath5si@xmath6)@xmath4 and ybin@xmath5ag@xmath7cu@xmath8 intermetallic compounds . </S>",
    "<S> the characteristic temperatures of these compounds is greatly affected by doping , such that the ground state at @xmath9 and @xmath10 is completely different . </S>",
    "<S> a qualitative description of @xmath3 can be obtained from the scaling law but the quantitative features require microscopic modeling . </S>",
    "<S> we use for eucu@xmath4(ge@xmath5si@xmath6)@xmath4 and ybin@xmath5ag@xmath7cu@xmath8 the anderson and the falicov - kimball model , respectively .    ,    ,    71.10.hf ; 71.27.+a ; 75.30 mb    this paper explains the thermopower @xmath11 of eucu@xmath4(ge@xmath5si@xmath6)@xmath4 intermetalic compounds . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss , first , the systematics which emerges from the experimental results as ge concentration is varied from zero to one@xcite and show that the properties of the paramagnetic phase follow from kondo scatering on eu ions , which fluctuate between two hund s rule configurations . assuming that si - ge substitution gives rise to chemical pressure effect , which modifies the width and the position of an effective f - level representing the eu ions , we show that the nca solution of the anderson model gives the same features as seen in the data . </S>",
    "<S> ( for details on the modeling of the rare earth intermetallics , and on our method of solution , see ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . )    the thermopower of eucu@xmath4(ge@xmath5si@xmath6)@xmath4 is characterized for @xmath12 by a large peak centered at temperature @xmath13 150 k. the value of @xmath11 at @xmath14 is large , @xmath15 , and above @xmath14 the thermopower falls - off slowly . at low temperatures </S>",
    "<S> @xmath11 assumes a linear form and the slope @xmath16 is small . </S>",
    "<S> the specific heat is featureless and @xmath17 also is small . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath18 the width of the thermopower peak is reduced and @xmath14 shifts rapidly to lower values as @xmath19 is reduced . here , @xmath11 changes sign for @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath21 remains large , @xmath16 is enhanced with respect to the @xmath12 data . in this concentration range </S>",
    "<S> @xmath22 changes rapidly with @xmath19 and for @xmath23 assumes very large values . </S>",
    "<S> the electrical resistance @xmath24 has a broad maximum which is shifted to lower temperatures as @xmath19 is reduced . </S>",
    "<S> the resistivity maximum occurs at @xmath25 but @xmath24 drops off slowly and is quite large at @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the ground state is a fermi liquid ( fl ) up to @xmath26 and then becomes magnetic . </S>",
    "<S> the specific heat and the electrical resistance show at @xmath27 a clear - cut anomaly but the afm transition can be seen in the @xmath11 data only for @xmath28 . for @xmath29 the thermopower has a sharp cusp at @xmath27 , i.e the overall shape of @xmath11 in these samples appears to be quite different from the shape seen in non - magnetic samples . </S>",
    "<S> however , if we assume @xmath30 in this concentration range , we see that the magnetic samples exhibit above @xmath27 the same features as the non - magnetic samples well above @xmath31 . the size of the specific heat anomaly and the value of @xmath27 increase rapidly with @xmath19 up to about @xmath32@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the electrical resistance also changes shape across the magnetic boundary . </S>",
    "<S> ( see fig . 6 in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) that is , for @xmath33 , the transport properties of the paramagnetic phase follow the same pattern and seem to be due to the same scattering mechanism , regardless of the nature of the ground state which develops at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath34 the size of @xmath11 becomes very small and is not affected by the afm transition , which leads to a sharp anomaly in @xmath35 and also shows up clearly in the electrical resistance . </S>",
    "<S> ( see figs . 4 and 7 in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite )    the initial thermopower slope of the paramagnetic samples changes by more than one order of magnitude .    </S>",
    "<S> the eu ions fluctuate between the eu@xmath36 and eu@xmath37 configurations , as indicated by the photoemission data .    </S>",
    "<S> the si doping reduces the unit - cell volume and leads to the mixing of the eu@xmath36 and eu@xmath37 configurations , as indicated clearly by the xps data@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the afm transition persists up to @xmath38 but already for @xmath39 the interconfigurational mixing leads to the kondo effect with kondo scale comparable to @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of these systems for @xmath40 can be explained by the nca solution of the spin - degenerate anderson model with @xmath41 and using parameters such that @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> starting at high temperatures , we find for @xmath43 a small negative thermopower and a large total entropy , such that @xmath44@xcite . at temperature </S>",
    "<S> @xmath31 the thermopower changes sign and then continues to increase . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath31 is a monotonic function of @xmath45 but the relationship is not universal ; for @xmath45 between 5 k and 20 k our calculations give @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> ( note , the experimental result for @xmath31 is very sensitive to any additional contribution to @xmath47 . ) </S>",
    "<S> the reduction of temperature gives rise to a partial screening of the eu@xmath36 moment but the magnetic entropy is not completely removed by kondo effect , because the spin density wave ( sdw ) transition sets in at @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> the neutron scattering data which might show the sdw are not available for eucu@xmath4(ge@xmath5si@xmath6)@xmath4 but some evidence of a sdw transition in a reduced - moment antiferromagnet is provided by recent neutron scattering data on cepd@xmath4si@xmath4 compound at high pressure@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( unfortunately , the high - pressure thermopower and the specific heat data on this compound are not available . ) </S>",
    "<S> the sdw transition removes the magnetic entropy but the system remains in the metallic state and the specific heat below @xmath27 is temperature dependent . </S>",
    "<S> the thermopower tracks the entropy of the fermionic degrees of freedom and decreases linearly below @xmath27 , so that @xmath48 exhibits a clear cusp at @xmath27@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath27 defined by this cusp , or by the discontinuity of @xmath35 , increases with @xmath19 and reaches maximum at @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> the size of the @xmath35-discontinuity is roughly independent of si - concentration for @xmath50 but @xmath51 increases rapidly with @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath52 the @xmath27 starts to decrease , the discontinuity of @xmath35 becomes weaker , and the cusp in @xmath48 is gradually transformed into a rounded maximum . </S>",
    "<S> thus , while @xmath27 shows a non - monotonic behavior , @xmath31 and @xmath45 increase continuously with @xmath19 , and @xmath53 changes from @xmath54 for @xmath55 to @xmath56 for @xmath57 . for @xmath58 and temperatures around @xmath27 , the entropy has a large sdw contribution , such that @xmath59 but for @xmath60 the universal behavior , @xmath61 , should be recovered . </S>",
    "<S> ( does one get @xmath62 in ceal@xmath4 , ceb@xmath63 , and other kondo systems with @xmath64 ? )    the low - temperature specific heat and the thermopower change from @xmath65 and @xmath66 for @xmath67 to @xmath68 and @xmath69 for @xmath10 , giving @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , an increase in @xmath45 by more than one order of magnitude , and the complete change in the character of the ground state , has little effect on the low - temperature value of @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> the slight increase of @xmath72 with the si doping is most likely due to a reduction of the f - charge , which accompanies the enhanced mixed - valence character of the si - rich samples and can be accounted for by eq.[resonant_siam ] . </S>",
    "<S> the sharp drop of @xmath73 above @xmath45 indicates the crossover to weak coupling limit and the localization of the f - electrons , i.e. , the change in @xmath74 .    </S>",
    "<S> = -0.12 and for various hybridization widths @xmath75 , as indicated in the figure . , </S>",
