    "recently a surge of interest in the dynamical properties of mesoscopic / nanoscale electronic systems has motivated a number of theoretical and experimental studies on the physics of electronic devices subject to the driving of external fields .",

    ", the effect of the driving of external microwave fields has been shown to lead to an intriguing zero resistance state in quantum hall systems  @xcite , and is currently studied as a tool to control the coherent dynamics of superconducting josephson qubits  @xcite .",
    "investigations of periodically driven mesoscopic systems / quantum dots addressed mostly the limit of low intensity driving  @xcite . in this case , electrons have enough time to explore ergodically all available phase space before performing a single photon assisted transition in energy space .",
    "this makes it possible to use an effective time dependent random matrix theory to describe the dynamics of the system . on the other hand ,",
    "as beautifully shown by recent experiments in superconducting qubits  @xcite and in the quantum hall regime  @xcite , as the intensity of driving increases one should expect both an enhancement of the probability of single - photon processes , and the emergence of multi - photon processes / resonances in the dynamical properties of the system under study .",
    "= 0.7    ( 4,4 )    the goal of this paper is to characterize the influence of multiphoton processes on the dynamical properties of mesoscopic electronic systems , concentrating on their effect on the electron dynamics in energy space ( diffusion / localization ) . diffusion and localization in energy space , as well as of multi - photon processes ,",
    "have been the subject of a number of studies in the context of the optics of complex atoms / molecules  @xcite . in these systems",
    "the underlying electron dynamics is typically very complex and a statistical description , either equivalent to random matrix theory or explicitly using it , is compulsory .",
    "in contrast , in the present study we go beyond random matrix theory focusing on a model mesoscopic system , a diffusive quasi - one dimensional ring threaded by an oscillating flux ( see fig.[fig0 ] and eq.([ham ] ) ) , were the underlying microscopic dynamics can be studied in detail .",
    "we explore how multi - photon processes proliferate as the driving amplitude is increased or the driving frequency is decreased , study the resulting crossover from ultra - quantum / low - intensity limit to quasi - classical / high - intensity limit , and extract its physical consequences . on the theoretical side ,",
    "we demonstrate and use extensively an interesting analogy between the quantum kinetic equation for the electron distribution function and the recursion relation defining a continuous time random walk  @xcite in energy space .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "the elementary time scale controlling the dynamics of energy absorbtion / emission is the mean free time @xmath3 .",
    "indeed , in a diffusive quasi-1d ring threaded by a flux @xmath4 , energy changes quantized in units @xmath5 occur provided an electron scatters off an impurity .",
    "this is due to the fact that during the ballistic trajectory in between scattering events the flux perturbation @xmath6 , @xmath7 being the velocity operator , commutes with the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath8 , therefore causing no transitions whatsoever .    in the _ ultra - quantum limit of weak perturbations",
    "single - photon processes dominate . in other words ,",
    "in one scattering event an electron may either absorb / emit one quantum , or scatter elastically .",

    "acquires an energy @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the electric field generated by the time dependent flux , and @xmath18 is the momentum direction in the @xmath19-dimensional space .",
    "let us introduce the probability density @xmath20 of changing the energy by @xmath10 between two successive scattering events at @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "given the poisson distribution @xmath21 of time intervals @xmath22 , neglecting acceleration by an electric field @xmath23 , and assuming isotropic scattering , one may immediately write @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes the averaging over momentum directions . for an harmonic time",

    "_    multiphoton processes drive the crossover between discrete energy absorbtion in the ultra - quantum limit [ eq.([rmt ] ) ] , and continuous energy absorbtion in the quasi - classical limit [ eq.([p - w ] ) ] .",

    "the two distinct regimes of rare ( @xmath41 ) and proliferating ( @xmath50 ) multiple photon processes have been discussed by keldysh  @xcite in his seminal work on atom ionization . in this case",
    "the two regimes are classified by the ratio @xmath51 of the inverse time @xmath52 of tunneling through the potential barrier titled by the electric field @xmath53 , @xmath54 being the ionization threshold , and of the frequency of the applied electromagnetic field @xmath55 . the qualitative connection between ref .

    "let us now make the qualitative considerations above more precise .",
    "as shown in sec.[quantitative ] in terms of a keldysh diagrammatic analysis  @xcite , the dynamics of energy absorption / emission in the system at hand may be conveniently described as _ random walk _ in the energy space described by the recursion relation for the electron energy distribution function @xmath59 @xmath60 neglecting weak localization effects controlled by the parameter @xmath61 and effects of dynamic localization controlled by the parameter @xmath62 ( where @xmath63 is the mean separation of electron levels in a finite system )  @xcite , the kernel @xmath64 , is given by the product of two functions @xmath65 .",

    "higher moments , such as @xmath104 , which in contrast to the second moment do contain information about the _ ultra - quantum to _ quasi - classical crossover , influence higher order corrections .",
