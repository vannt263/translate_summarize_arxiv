    "a frustrated triangular lattice ising antiferromagnet ( tlia ) with spin 1/2 is long known to display no long - range ordering down to zero temperature  @xcite , albeit the ground state is critical with the power - law decaying spin - correlation function  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , a long - range order can occur in the ground state if the spin is larger than some critical value , estimated as 11/2  @xcite .",
    "generally , the lack of order in frustrated spin systems is due to large ground - state degeneracy .",
    "however , this can be lifted by various perturbations , such as an external magnetic field  @xcite or selective dilution  @xcite , which can result in long - range ordering even in tlia with spin 1/2 . in the ising models with spin larger than 1/2 , a single - ion anisotropy and higher - order ( e.g. , biquadratic )",
    "exchange interactions may play a crucial role in their critical properties ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) . the model that incorporates the above mentioned effects",
    "is known as blume - emery - griffiths ( beg ) model  @xcite and has a long history of investigation  @xcite . in the case of the beg model with antiferromagnetic interactions ,",
    "it is interesting to study its behavior in an external magnetic field .",
    "a recent study by using exact recursion relations on the bethe lattice  @xcite produced some interesting results , such as the reentrant phenomenon with the consecutive phase transitions from disorder to order and back to disorder as the field was increased . however , as already observed for example in the simple tlia model with spin 1/2 , a frustrated antiferromagnet in the presence of an external field behaves quite differently than its nonfrustrated counterpart  @xcite . a frustrated blume - capel model on a triangular lattice , which is special case of our beg model with zero biquadratic exchange interactions and zero magnetic field , has been investigated by position - space renormalization group methods  @xcite and has been shown to display finite - temperature long - range ordering within a certain range of the single - ion anisotropy strength , accompanied with a multicritical behavior . in order to understand finite - temperature behavior of the frustrated spin systems , which is often unexpected and intricate , it is important to understand their ground - state properties .",
    "+ in the present letter we consider the geometrically frustrated antiferromagnetic beg model on a triangular lattice in the presence an external magnetic field . as a result of the frustration ,",
    "the ground state of such a system is highly degenerate . on the other hand ,",
    "the model features a number of different perturbations that can lift this degeneracy in different ways and thus we can expect much richer variety of magnetic structures in a broad parameter space than for a nonfrustrated case .",
    "we consider the spin-1 ising model on a triangular lattice described by the hamiltonian @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a spin on the @xmath2th lattice site , @xmath3 denotes the sum over nearest neighbors , @xmath4 is an antiferromagnetic bilinear exchange interaction parameter , @xmath5 is a biquadratic exchange interaction parameter , @xmath6 is a single - ion anisotropy parameter , and @xmath7 is an external magnetic field .",
    "+ considering the presence of only nearest - neighbor interactions , it is sufficient to focus on an elementary triangular plaquette formed by the neighboring spins . then , a reduced zero - temperature energy per spin can be expressed as @xmath8 where the summation @xmath9 runs over the nearest neighbors @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) on the plaquette .",
    "ground - state ( gs ) spin configurations @xmath13 can be found as configurations that minimize the energy functional @xmath14 with the parameters values @xmath15 , i.e. : @xmath16 apparently , for some parameters values there will be no single optimal solution but rather a multitude of degenerate states with the same energy . then the gs energy per spin can be obtained as a function of the parameters @xmath17 : @xmath18 .",
    "+ in order to demonstrate the presence and character of different phases resulting from the gs configurations found from eq .",
    "( [ gs ] ) , we further employ monte carlo ( mc ) method and study magnetization processes in different regions of the parameter space .",
    "we perform mc simulations on a spin system of a moderate linear size of @xmath19 , employing the metropolis dynamics and applying the periodic boundary conditions . for thermal averaging",
    "we consider @xmath20 mcs ( monte carlo sweeps or steps per spin ) after discarding another @xmath21 mcs for thermalization . for configurational averaging and calculating error bars we carry out five independent runs .",
    "the simulations are performed at a fixed reduced temperature close to the ground state ( @xmath22 ) and a varying external field @xmath23 .",
    "the simulations start from zero field , using a random initial configuration , and then the field is gradually increased with the step @xmath24 and the simulation starts from the final configuration obtained at the previous field value .",
    "the triangular lattice is considered to be consisting of three interpenetrating sublattices a , b and c , and we calculate the respective sublattice magnetizations per site @xmath25 and the total magnetization per site @xmath26 where @xmath27 denotes thermal averages .",
    "by minimizing the energy functional ( eq .  [ gs ] ) we identified gs configurations and calculated gs energy in a broad parameter space . in fig .",
    "[ fig : gs_energy ] we show the gs energy surfaces in the @xmath28 parameter plane for various values of the biquadratic exchange parameter @xmath29 superimposed are the lines separating different phases , which are presented in table  [ tab : deg_states ] with the lists of the corresponding degenerate states and their energies . ] .",
    "the analytical expressions for these phase boundaries can be obtained by pairwise equating the gs energies .",
    "we can see that , depending on the parameters values , the system can be in up to eighth different phases . in the asymptotic limits of the parameters , for large negative values of the single - ion anisotropy @xmath30 the system is in the nonmagnetic state @xmath31 ,",
    "while for large positive values of @xmath30 the nonmagnetic spin states are suppressed and we can expect the behavior similar to that of the spin-1/2 model . on the other hand ,",
    "for large magnetic fields @xmath23 the system adopts the magnetic state @xmath32 with all the spins fully aligned with the field direction . in the mentioned cases of the large negative @xmath30 ( ) and large @xmath23 ( )",
    "the degeneracy is lifted completely . on the other hand ,",
    "there is still three - fold ( , , ) and six - fold ( , , ) degeneracy if the parameters are of intermediate and relatively small values , respectively .",
    "we note that at the boundaries the degeneracy is further increased due to contributions of states from the neighboring phases and there are up to five points in which even three different phases coincide .",
    ".ground - state phases identified by eq .  ( [ gs ] ) with the corresponding degenerate states @xmath33 and energies @xmath34 , at the parameters values @xmath15 . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     with the respect to the above arguments on the behavior of the local spin patterns",
    ", we can expect the presence of interesting magnetic structures on the entire lattice in different regions of the parameter space .",
    "the character of the respective phases can be revealed by inspecting the sublattice magnetizations @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 as well as the total magnetization @xmath38 , obtained from mc simulations .",
    "their field - dependencies for a fixed temperature @xmath39 and the biquadratic exchange parameter @xmath40 , and three different values of the single - ion anisotropy parameter are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : mc_mag_j20 ] .",
    "the inset spin snapshots in the respective figures illustrate typical spin configurations for different values of the field @xmath23 , representing different phases .",
    "positive values of the parameter @xmath6 tend to suppress nonmagnetic states and the spin system is expected to behave like a spin-1/2 tlia .",
    "namely , it is expected to show no long - range order in zero field , the ferrimagnetic state of the type @xmath41 with two sublattice magnetizations aligned parallel and one antiparallel to the field direction ( i.e. , 1/3 magnetization plateau ) within @xmath42 , and the ferromagnetic state with all three sublattice magnetizations aligned with the field direction for @xmath43  @xcite .",
    "this scenario is supported by the plots presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : m - h_j2_0_d_1 ] for @xmath44 . on the other hand , negative values of the parameter @xmath6",
    "tend to enhance nonmagnetic states .",
    "however , for relatively small magnitudes , more specifically for @xmath40 it is within @xmath45 hence also for @xmath46 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : m - h_j2_0_d_-1 ] , in zero field the minimum energy is realized if nonmagnetic states are restricted to only one sublattice , while the remaining two sublattices are ordered antiferromagnetically , i.e. , the structure of the type @xmath47 . as the field increases",
    ", the structure evolves first to the type @xmath48 , then to @xmath49 and finally for sufficiently large fields to @xmath50 .",
    "thus , the total magnetization @xmath38 features four plateaus with the values @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , corresponding to the respective magnetic structures .",
    "finally , for negative @xmath6 of large magnitudes , namely for @xmath40 it is for @xmath55 and thus also for @xmath56 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : m - h_j2_0_d_-2 ] , the nonmagnetic state @xmath57 is the ground state at small enough fields .",
    "the increasing field then brings the system successively to the states of the types @xmath58 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "this again splits the magnetization curve @xmath38 into four plateaus of the same heights as for the case @xmath46 , albeit now the steps correspond to generally different magnetic structures .",
    "+ in fig .",
    "[ fig : mc_mag_j2 - 05 ] we present similar plots also for a non - zero value of the biquadratic exchange interaction parameter , namely for @xmath59 , and three different values of the single - ion anisotropy parameter @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the phases involved are the same as for the case of @xmath40 and , therefore , we do not illustrate their nature again by showing the snapshots .",
    "nevertheless , the sequence of the phases through which the system passes as the field increases can be different , such as @xmath62{\\node[shape = circle , draw , inner sep=2pt ] ( char ) { 5 } ; } } \\rightarrow { \\tikz[baseline=(char.base)]{\\node[shape = circle , draw , inner sep=2pt ] ( char ) { 2 } ; } } \\rightarrow { \\tikz[baseline=(char.base)]{\\node[shape = circle , draw , inner sep=2pt ] ( char ) { 3 } ; } } \\rightarrow { \\tikz[baseline=(char.base)]{\\node[shape = circle , draw , inner sep=2pt ] ( char ) { 7};}}$ ] for @xmath63 , which can not be observed at any value of @xmath64 if @xmath40 .",
    "we have shown that the geometrically frustrated beg model in an external magnetic field displays a relatively rich variety of different ground - state phases in the parameter space .",
    "they result from the large degeneracy , which is lifted in several stages with the increasing influence of the respective parameters . for selected parameter values we confirmed the existence of multiple magnetic structures , reflected in the step - wise field - dependence of the magnetization curves , in the monte carlo simulations at very low temperature .",
    "we believe that the present results will stimulate further study of the effects of thermal excitations on the individual ground - state spin arrangements and to establish entire finite - temperature phase diagrams .",
