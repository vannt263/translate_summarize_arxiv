    "the mechanism of forming nanoflares is the dissipation of current sheets arisen from tangential discontinuities in the continuously evolving corona ( levine 1974 , parker 1988 ) .",
    "parker presumes that the change in the magnetic field across the current sheet , @xmath1 , is critical for the onset . when the strength @xmath2 of the discontinuity exceeds some threshold , there is a runaway dynamical instability leading to an explosive reconnection phase",
    "this is similar to the sand pile model that has been used to explain the comparison is also made between results of different methods .",
    "avalanches of magnetic reconnection ( lu & hamilton 1991 ) , pointed out that the magnetic field of the corona is in a state of self organized criticality . to determine whether nanoflares are the main source of heat input to the corona or not , it is necessary to measure the energy frequency distribution of the smallest observed flares .",
    "hudson ( 1991 ) pointed out that the flare occurrence follows a power law distribution such as , @xmath3 , in which @xmath4 is the number of flares per energy interval @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( lu & hamilton ( 1991 ) obtained this distribution for complex systems which are in a self organized critical state ) .",
    "the power law index , @xmath0 , is a critical value for determining whether more weight is given to small scale events ( nanoflares ) or larger ones ( flares ) .",
    "determination of the power law index of the flare frequency distribution is a scientific challenge .",
    "many authors have attempted to find this index .",

    "imaging the same events from two different locations enables us to have three dimensional images ( http://stereo.gsfc.nasa.gov/ ) .",
    "the extreme ultra violet imager ( euvi ) telescope is a part of secchi instrument suite which is sensitive at 171  , 195  , 284  , and 304  . in the present work we restrict ourselves to 171   images with time cadence of 2.5 minutes ( welser et al .",

    "the above process was followed    for other selected regions ( on euvi and aia ) too .",
    "we note that the    light curves have 573 and 939 time steps for euvi and aia    respectively .",
    "we fed each light curves ( observed time series ) to the    network to determine the nanoflare model parameters ( section    [ result ] ) .",
    "assuming that the coronal euv emission is caused by many random flares with flare radiance , following a power law frequency distribution we take a model which consists of a time series of random kicks according to the presumption that flaring is intrinsically a stochastic process , each is given by a rising time @xmath13 and a damping time @xmath14 ( pauluhn & solanki 2007 , safari et al .",

    "pauluhn & solanki ( 2007 ) have shown that for a large number of independent random flares , the distribution of normalized radiance in quiet sun follows a lognormal .",

    "the lognormal function is given by @xmath18 where , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 are the radiance , scale parameter , and shape parameter , respectively .",
    "the good fits give us confidence in applying a stochastic flare model .",
    "the key parameters ( power law exponents , damping rates and flare rates ) of small scale events ( small eruptions ) are not identifiable directly from observations .",
    "pauluhn & solanki ( 2007 ) and safari et al . (",
    "2007 ) , estimated that the damping rates and flare rates could be deduced by comparing light curves with simulated time series .",
    "they have used the shape parameters of lognormal fits and wavelet analysis .",
    "it is interesting to compare our model and it s parameters to that of represented in recent works .",
    "vekstein & katsukawa ( 2000 ) assume that the energy distribution of the nanoflares has a power law spectrum , bounded between some minimum and maximum energy release .",
    "they suggest that : each nanoflares create a filament with cross - section area which has been then divided into small grids ; nanoflares are generated randomly inside these grids with a finite occurrence rate ; and evolves with two stage of cooling process ( conduction and radiation heat ) .",
    "the heat conduction and radiation are derived according to scaling low ( e. g. , rosner et al .",

    "they concluded that , the noises could not simulate the light curves observed hinode / sxt . performing a monte carlo simulation they perturb the flat light curves with a sequence of random segments of exponential decays linked together .",
    "the parameters of their model are the e - folding time , the interval between two successive perturbation and the amplitude .",
    "finally they found some simulated light curves which is in best match with the observed data .",

    "there is a physical picture of how the parameters affect the light curves .",
    "the mean , variance , skewness , and kurtosis of the time series are shown in figures [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] versus @xmath0 . both the mean and variance of the time series decrease , as @xmath0 increases .",
    "expectedly , the more the @xmath0 ( corresponds to more small events ) the less the intensities become . with a fixed @xmath0 and @xmath17 as @xmath14 increases , the mean and variance increases accordingly",
    "this also occurs when @xmath0 and @xmath14 are fixed and @xmath17 changes .",
    "the higher moments ( skewness and kurtosis ) of the time series increase with increasing @xmath0 , @xmath14 , and @xmath17 . due to lognormal shape of the distributions , both skewness and kurtosis values are positive ( figure [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "a positive value of skewness signifies a distribution with an asymmetric tail extending out towards larger radiance .",
    "in general , the geometric median ( @xmath22 ) is less than the geometric mean ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "this is agree with terzo et al .",
    "they have shown that , the distributions of intensity fluctuations taken from individual pixels , multi - pixel subregions , or the entire active region as observed by hinode / sxt are asymmetric .",
    "we knew that , the shape parameter is inversely in proportion to @xmath24 ( pauluhn & solanki 2007 ) and that the lognormal shape parameter , @xmath21 , slightly changes with @xmath0 .",
    "although , the sharpness of the distribution indicates that for a higher @xmath0 , the distribution shape tends to be sharpener as illustrated by the kurtosis increase ( figure [ fig5 ] ) .",

    "we employed a kind of artificial neural networks , called probabilistic neural network ( pnns specht 1988 , 1990 ) which is suitable for classification .",
    "a classification problem is defined with a set of inputs @xmath25 and targets @xmath26 .",
    "pnn is a kind of supervised network .",
    "it means that the learning process of the network takes place with an initially specified set of inputs and targets , called trained samples .",
    "if we assume that the input vectors contain @xmath27 different classes , then every target vector would contains @xmath27 elements .",
    "one of them is 1 , which corresponds to its own class and the others are zero .",
    "the pnn has two layers ( figure [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "when an input vector is fed to the network , the first layer calculates the distance between the input vector and the trained samples .",
    "so , it provides a vector the elements of which define the distance between the input and trained samples .",
    "the second layer produces a vector which contains the probabilities using the output of the first layer .",
    "finally the competitive transfer function of the second layer chooses the maximum likelihood value within the probabilities vector and produces the output @xmath28 for it and the output zero for the others . using this process",
    ", the network matches the input vector to one of the existing @xmath27 classes which has the maximum likelihood value .",
    "we ran the commands of the mentioned process in the neural network toolbox ( wasserman 1993 ) .",

    "3- : :     the input weights of first layer of the network is a matrix , elements    of which are the trained samples couples ( input and targets ) .",
    "let us    consider an observed light curve which the set of it s key parameters    are not known .",
    "once the unknown light curve ( test sample ) is fed to    the network as an input vector , it s distance from the 22041 trained    vectors is calculated by the first layer .",
    "so , it would be determined    how close the input is to the vector of trained set .",
    "consequently , for    an input vector closest to trained one , the existent transfer function    of the first layer produces 1 .",
    "if the input vector has the same    distance from two or more trained samples , then the output includes    two or more 1 .",

    "we found that , these labels ranged from 1 to 22041 , which corresponded to simulated light curves for which the key parameters range from the set of @xmath40 to @xmath41 , as was stated in the previous section . in the bottom panels , the frequencies ( histogram ) of power law index , damping time , and flare rate , are extracted as well .",
    "as we see in figures [ fig8 ] , [ fig9 ] , and [ fig10 ] the network s output for @xmath0 are concentrated on the range between 2 - 3 .",
    "the mean power law index , @xmath0 , is 2.8 , 2.7 and 2.6 for intensity averaged over @xmath9 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 pixels , respectively .",
    "there are the similar values for the standard deviations , @xmath42 .",
    "as was expected , the power law index falls as the the dimension of pixel s average intensity increases .",
    "this confirms that , larger areas involve larger flare events .",
    "we note that the @xmath14 values increase with binning .",
    "for example , the average @xmath14 for @xmath9 pixels is 43 and for @xmath12 pixels it is 53 . the @xmath14 seems to depend on the event size .",
    "this suggests that the larger areas as was expected have greater background .",
    "the response of the stereo / euvi 171    as a function of plasma temperature is within the range @xmath43 ( wlser et al .",
    "if we suppose the plasma cooling through this narrow band filter is dominated by radiative losses process , then the cooling time , @xmath44 , would be ranged from a few seconds to an hour ( see e. g. , aschwanden 2000 , 2004 ) . using the mean dimensionless @xmath45 and multiplying it by cadence of 2.5 min ( for stereo / euvi , 13 june 2007 ) , we obtain a value of 2 hours .",

    "there are 62 and 64 percent of @xmath14 with @xmath48 ( @xmath4917 ) concentrated around mean values .",
    "this suggests that the background emission in the coronal hole is lower compared to its surrounding areas .",
    "one point is that there is no considerable difference between @xmath14 inside and outside the coronal hole .",
    "this is due to the fact that the damping times should be roughly the same everywhere because by choosing a specific filter we are picking up the same event phase .",

    "more than 53 and 59 percent of @xmath17s with @xmath50 ( @xmath490.2 ) are concentrated around the mean values .    in the coronal hole",
    "the largest number of events have low flare rates @xmath510.2 ( figure [ fig11 ] ) .",
    "this is what one would expect when there is an almost low background as a consequence of open magnetic field .",
    "outside the coronal hole , the average flare rate is @xmath52 ( figure [ fig12 ] ) .",
    "it seems that the higher the @xmath17 is , the smoother the background will be .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig13 ] , this would explain why the higher @xmath17s are found in the cell centers ( the bright regions of the mentioned figure ) .",
    "the greater the variation of the background is , the lower the @xmath17 value will be .",
    "so , this explains why low @xmath17s are seen at the junctions ( the dark regions in figure [ fig13 ] ) .",
    "the cadence of sdo / aia ( 90s for 22 august 2010 ) is less than that of stereo / euvi ( 150s for 13 june 2007 ) . as is shown in figures [ fig8 ] and [ fig12 ] ( we compare this figures because of their similar averaging dimensions on pixels regions ) the higher the cadence is , the lower the average of damping time rate ( which actually is less than 150/90 ) will be . for further examination , we produced aia light curves with the cadences of @xmath53 and @xmath54s ( for both regions partitioning @xmath9 and @xmath11 pixels ) from the test region in figure [ fig1 ] .",

    "the basic aim of the model , as mentioned earlier , is to determine the coronal heat input by numerous randomly distributed small scale events specially nanoflares by finding the power law index .",
    "this will decides whether the small scale event contribution is of importance or not .",
    "the problem of the too power law index indicated by researchers may have been just a bias due to neglecting the overlapping nanoflares .    here , a simple nanoflare model based on three key parameters ( the flare rate , the flare decay time , and the power law exponent of the flare energy frequency distribution ) is used to simulate emission line radiances from the stereo / euvi and sdo / aia in the corona .",
