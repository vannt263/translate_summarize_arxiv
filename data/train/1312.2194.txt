    "let @xmath0 be a finite set of points in the plane .",
    "let @xmath5 and @xmath4 denote the euclidean voronoi diagram and delaunay triangulation of @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "the delaunay triangulation consists of all triangles spanned by @xmath0 whose circumcircles do not contain points of @xmath0 in their interior .",
    "a pair of points @xmath6 are connected by a delaunay edge if and only if there is a circle passing through @xmath7 and @xmath8 that does not contain any point of @xmath0 in its interior .",
    "delaunay triangulations and their duals , voronoi diagrams , are among the most extensively and longest studied constructs in computational geometry , with a wide range of applications . for a _ static _ point set",
    "@xmath0 , both @xmath4 and @xmath5 have linear complexity and can be computed in optimal @xmath9 time .",
    "see @xcite for surveys and a textbook on these structures .",
    "the problem has also been studied in the _ dynamic _ setting , where one seeks to maintain @xmath4 and @xmath5 under updates of @xmath0 ( insertion and deletion of points ) ; see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "* the kinetic setting : previous work . * in many applications of delaunay / voronoi methods ( e.g. , mesh generation and kinetic collision detection ) the points of the input set @xmath0 are moving continuously , so these diagrams need to be efficiently updated during the motion .",
    "even though the motion of the points is continuous , the combinatorial structure of the voronoi and delaunay diagrams changes only at discrete times when certain critical events occur .",
    "interest in efficient maintenance of geometric structures under simple motion in @xmath0 is a is fixed - degree polynomial in @xmath10 .",
    "] of the underlying point set goes back at least to atallah @xcite . for the purpose of kinetic maintenance ,",
    "delaunay triangulations are nice structures , because , as mentioned above , they admit local certifications associated with individual triangles ( namely , that their circumcircles be @xmath0-empty ) .",
    "this makes it simple to maintain @xmath4 under point motion : an update is necessary only when one of these empty circumcircle conditions fails  this ( typically ) corresponds to co - circularities of certain subsets of four points , where the relevant circumcircle is @xmath0-empty .",
    "whenever such an event , referred to as a _ delaunay co - circularity _ in this paper , happens , a single edge flip easily restores delaunayhood .",
    "in addition , the delaunay triangulation changes when some triple of points of @xmath0 become collinear on the boundary of the convex hull of @xmath0 ; see below for details .",
    "hence , the performance of any voronoi- or delaunay - based kinetic algorithm depends on the maximum possible number of _ discrete changes _ ,",
    "that is , delaunay co - circularities and convex hull collinearities , which @xmath4 experiences during the motion of its points .",
    "this paper studies the best - known formulation of the problem , in which each point of @xmath0 moves along a straight line with unit speed ; see @xcite . in this case , the ( previously ) best - known upper bound on the number of discrete changes in @xmath4 is @xmath11 . in the more general ( and even more difficult ) version of the problem ,",
    "each point of @xmath0 moves with so - called pseudo - algebraic motion of constant description complexity .",
    "this implies ( in particular ) that any four points are co - circular at most @xmath12 times , and any triple of points can are collinear at most @xmath13 times , for some constants @xmath14 .",
    "given these ( purely topological ) restrictions on the continuous motion of @xmath0 , fu and lee @xcite , and guibas et al .",
    "@xcite established a roughly cubic upper bound of @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the ( almost linear ) maximum length of an @xmath17-davenport - schinzel sequence  @xcite .",
    "a substantial gap exists between these near - cubic upper bounds and the best known quadratic lower bound  @xcite .",
    "closing this gap has been in the computational geometry lore for many years , and is considered as one of the major open problems in the field .",
    "it is listed as problem 2 in the topp project ; see @xcite .",
    "a recent work @xcite by the author provides an almost tight bound of @xmath2 , for any @xmath3 , for a more restricted version of the problem , in which any four points can be co - circular at most _ twice_.    in view of the very slow progress on the above general problem , several alternative structures were studied .",
    "for example , chew @xcite proved that @xmath5 undergoes a near - quadratic number of discrete changes if it is defined with respect to a  polygonal \" distance function .",
    "more recent studies @xcite show how to maintain a ( non - delaunay ) triangulation of @xmath0 so that it undergoes only a near - quadratic number of changes .",

    "our result . *",
    "we study the problem in a purely topological setup , where we assume that ( i ) any four points of @xmath0 are co - circular at most three times during their ( continuous ) motion , and ( ii ) any three points of @xmath0 can be collinear at most twice . for any point set @xmath0 whose motion satisfies these two axioms",
    ", we derive a nearly tight upper bound of @xmath2 , for any @xmath3 , on the overall number of discrete changes experienced by @xmath4 . as is well known ( and briefly discussed in appendix [ appsec : unitspeeds ] )",
    ", these properties hold for points that move along straight lines with a common ( unit ) speed , so our near - quadratic bound holds in this case",
    ".    * proof ingredients . *",
    "the majority of the discrete changes in @xmath4 occur at moments @xmath19 when some four points @xmath20 are co - circular , and the corresponding circumdisc contains no other points of @xmath0 .",
    "we refer to these events as _ delaunay co - circularities_. suppose that @xmath21 appear along their common circumcircle in this order , so @xmath22 and @xmath23 form the chords of the convex quadrilateral spanned by these points .",
    "right before @xmath19 , one of the chords , say @xmath23 , is delaunay and thus admits a @xmath0-empty disc whose boundary contains @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "right after time @xmath19 , the edge @xmath23 is replaced in @xmath4 by @xmath22 , an operation known as an _ edge - flip_. informally , this happens because the delaunayhood of @xmath23 is violated by @xmath24 and @xmath25 : any disc whose boundary contains @xmath7 and @xmath8 contains at least one of the points @xmath26 .",
    "if @xmath23 does not re - enter @xmath4 after time @xmath19 , we can charge the event at time @xmath19 to the edge @xmath23 , for a total of @xmath27 such events .",
    "we thus assume that @xmath23 is again delaunay at some moment @xmath28 .",
    "one of the major observations used in our analysis is that one of the following always holds : either the delaunayhood of @xmath23 is interrupted during @xmath29 by at least @xmath30 pairs @xmath31 , or this edge can be made delaunay throughout @xmath29 by removal of at most @xmath32 points of @xmath0 . in the former case ,",
    "each violating pair @xmath33 contributes during @xmath29 either a co - circularity of @xmath34 , or a collinearity in which one of the points @xmath35 or @xmath36 crosses @xmath23 .",
    "this fairly simple observation lies at the heart of our charging strategy .",
    "* combinatorial charging . *",
    "our goal is to derive a recurrence formula for the maximum number @xmath37 of such delaunay co - circularities induced by any set @xmath0 of @xmath1 points ( whose motion satisfies the above conditions ) . notice that the number of _ all _ co - circularities , each defined by some four points of @xmath0 , can be as large as @xmath38 .",
    "the challenge is thus to show that the vast majority of co - circularity events are not delaunay ( i.e. , their corresponding circumdiscs are penetrated by additional points of @xmath0 ) .    in section [ sec : prelim ] we study the set of all co - circularities that involve some disappearing delaunay edge @xmath23 and some other pair of points of @xmath39 , and occur during the period @xmath29 when @xmath23 is absent is more general , and applies to any interval @xmath29 with the property that @xmath23 is delaunay at one of its endpoints @xmath40 .",

    "a co - circularity is called _",
    "@xmath41-shallow _ if its circumdisc contains at most @xmath41 points of @xmath0 .",
    "if we find at least @xmath42 such @xmath41-shallow co - circularities points of @xmath0 .",
    "] , involving @xmath43 and another pair of points , we can charge them for the disappearance of @xmath23 .",
    "we use the routine probabilistic argument of clarkson and shor @xcite to show that the number of delaunay co - circularities , for which this simple charging works , is @xmath44 .",
    "informally , this term that such delaunay co - circularities contribute to the overall recurrence formula ( see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) , yields a near - quadratic bound for @xmath37 . similarly , if we find a  shallow \" collinearity of @xmath45 and another point ( one halfplane bounded by the line of collinearity contains at most @xmath41 points ) , we can charge the disappearance of @xmath23 to this collinearity . a combination of the clarkson - shor technique with the known near - quadratic bound on the number of topological changes in the convex hull of @xmath0 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 8.6.1 ) ) yields an additional near - quadratic term in the recurrence .",
    "* probabilistic refinement . *",
    "it thus remains to bound the number of the above delaunay co - circularities , for which @xmath7 and @xmath8 participate in fewer shallow co - circularities and in no shallow collinearity during @xmath29 .",
    "in this case , we show , in what follows we refer to as the _ red - blue theorem _ ( or theorem [ thm : redblue ] ) , that one can restore the delaunayhood of @xmath23 throughout @xmath29 by removal of some subset @xmath46 of at most @xmath47 points of @xmath0 . to bound the maximum number of such  non - chargeable \" events ,",
    "we incorporate them into more structured topological configurations ( or , more precisely , processes ) , which are likely to show up ( in the style of the clarkson - shor argument ) in a reduced delaunay triangulation @xmath48 , defined over a random sample @xmath49 of @xmath50 points .    for example , suppose that the above co - circularity at time @xmath19 , is the _",

    "a symmetric ( time - reversed ) argument applies if we encounter the _ first _ co - circularity of @xmath51 .",
    "as argued in the predecessor paper @xcite , delaunay crossings are especially nice objects due to their strict structural properties . in particular , as shown in @xcite : ( i ) the edges @xmath62 and @xmath63 belong to @xmath48 throughout the above interval @xmath58 , and ( ii ) assuming @xmath24 hits @xmath23 exactly once during @xmath58 , every other point @xmath64 is involved during this interval in a co - circularity with @xmath65 .    * the roadmap . * in section [ sec : reducetocrossings ] we show that the number of delaunay co - circularities is dominated by the maximum possible number of delaunay crossings .",
    "notice the previously sketched argument ( which appears in @xcite ) works only for the first and the last delaunay co - circularities of the quadruple .    to extend the above reduction to the remaining , ",
    "middle \" delaunay co - circularities , we resort in section [ sec : reducetocrossings ] to a fairly simple argument , expressing the maximum possible number of such co - circularities in terms of the numbers of extremal delaunay co - circularities and delaunay crossings that arise in smaller - size subsets of @xmath0 .    in section [ sec : crossonce ] , we recall ( or re - establish ) several structural properties of delaunay crossings , which will be used throughout the rest of the analysis . informally , our goal is to show that , for an average pair @xmath66 , the point @xmath67 is involved in ",

    "in section [ sec : countquad ] we apply the routine  charge - or - refine \" strategy ( via our red - blue theorem ) to analyze the maximum number of the above quadruples .",
    "this is done in several steps . at each stage",
    "we first try to dispose of as many quadruples as possible by charging each of them either to sufficiently many  shallow \" co - circularities ( or collinearities ) , or to one of the several kinds of  terminal \" triples , for which we provide back in section [ sec : crossonce ] a direct quadratic bound on their number .",
    "there are two main types of such terminal triples @xmath69 . in one of them",

    "the same triple performs two distinct  single \" delaunay crossings , where , say , @xmath24 crosses @xmath23 during one crossing , and @xmath8 crosses @xmath62 during the second one . in both cases",
    "the number of such triples is only @xmath27 .",
    "each step of the analysis enforces additional constraints on the surviving quadruples .",
    "there are two main types of such constraints .",
    "the first is to enforce more delaunay crossings involving sub - triples of the points of the quadruple .",
    "the other is to enforce  almost - delaunayhood \" of various pairs of points in the quadruple , for progressively larger time intervals . by this",
    "we mean that the corresponding edge is delaunay if we remove from @xmath0 a small subset of points .",
    "the ultimate goal is to enforce sufficiently many delaunay crossings , so that some triple of points undergoes _ two _ distinct delaunay crossings . as mentioned above , this is the main type of the  terminal \" configurations , for which we have a quadratic bound on their number .",
    "each step of the analysis yileds a recurrence formula that involves  near - quadratic \" terms ( of the kind mentioned earlier ) plus terms involving further - constrained configurations , until we finally bottom out ( in section [ sec : terminal ] ) by reaching the terminal triples mentioned above . in each of the recurrences we make use of the clarkson - shor probabilistic",
    "argument @xcite , in order to get rid of the small  obstruction \" subset of @xmath0 that we need to remove ; this is done by passing to a random sample of @xmath0 , the standard style of @xcite .",
    "the overall collection of recurrences solves to a near - quadratic bound , in a manner similar to many earlier works involving such recurrences ( see , e.g. , @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 7.3.2 ) ) .    unfortunately , the analysis is fairly involved and consists of many steps .",
    "in addition to the aforementioned type of quadruples ( formed by pairs of delaunay crossings ) , we use two additional classes of quadruples which are studied in sections [ sec : special ] and [ sec : terminal ] , respectively . note that only the last kind of configurations , referred to as _ terminal quadruples _ , can always be traced to some of the above  terminal \" triples .",
    "we postpone the rest of this discussion until section [ subsec : roadmap ] , where we provide a more detailed summary of the three classes of quadruples , and of the connections between these classes , and the delaunay crossings .",
