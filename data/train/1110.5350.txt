    "quantitative derivatives pricing was started by louis bachelier who first applied the concepts of brownian motion to the stochastic processes of finance @xcite . in this section",
    "we briefly resume the basic notions , definitions and results in quantitative finance that are needed for our purposes .",
    "our presentation will be focused on the mostly used financial model , i.e. the black - scholes model , on its main hypothesis , i.e. the random walk hypothesis , and on their shortcomings .",
    "thus , we do not pretend to be either complete or exhaustive here .",
    "an _ option _ is a derivative financial instrument specifying a contract between two parties for a future transaction of an asset at a specific price ( the _ strike price _ ) .",
    "the buyer of the option gains the right , which does not entail the obligation , to engage in this future transaction , whereas the seller incurs the corresponding obligation to fulfill this ( possible ) transaction at specified price .",
    "the price of an option derives from the difference between the _ strike price _ and the value of the _ underlying asset _ ( which can be a stock , a bond , a currency , etc . ) plus a premium based on the time remaining until the expiration of the option . more specifically , if we denote by @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 the _ total value _ of an option , its _ intrinsic value _ and the _ time value _ , i.e. the premium for potential to increase in value before expiring , respectively , we have @xmath3 where the intrinsic value of the option @xmath1 is expressed in terms of the current price @xmath4 of the underlying asset and the strike price @xmath5 by the formula @xmath6 an option which conveys the right to buy ( sell ) something at a specific price is called a _ call _ ( _ put _ ) .",
    "most options have an _ expiration date_. if the option is not exercised by the expiration date it becomes void and worthless .",
    "an option is called _",
    "european _ if it can be exercised on expiration , an option is called _ american _ if it may be exercised on any trading day on or before expiration .",
    "the intrinsic value of a call option is @xmath7 , while the intrinsic value of a put option is @xmath8 .",
    "if the intrinsic value of an option is positive , the option is called _ in - the - money _ , otherwise it is called _ out - of - the - money_.    the theoretical value of an option is evaluated according to specific mathematical models .",
    "they aim to predict how the value of an option changes in response to changing conditions .",
    "for example , how the price changes with respect to changes in time to expiration or how an increase in volatility would have an impact on the value .",
    "roughly speaking , option pricing theory studies the problem of the ` fair ' price of option at time @xmath9 before expiration date @xmath10 .",
    "the most widely used model of a financial market for the price of european put and call options is the _ black - scholes model _",
    "@xcite , which rules the price of the option over time . the basic idea behind this model is constructing a perfect hedged position , whose value would not depend on the price of the underlying asset ( typically , a stock ) in order to eliminate risk .",
    "the black ",
    "scholes model introduces explicitly the following assumptions :    \\(i ) there is no arbitrage opportunity , i.e. there is no way to make a riskless profit ;    \\(ii ) there is a known constant risk - free interest rate at which money can be borrowed and lent ;    \\(iii ) stocks can be traded costfree and in any amount ;    \\(iv ) the underlying asset does not pay a dividend ;    \\(v ) the stock price follows a geometric brownian motion with constant drift and constant volatility .",
    "assumption ( v ) implies that the price @xmath11 of the underlying asset is a stochastic process satisfying the following differential equation : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a wiener process of brownian motion ( a good discrete analogue for @xmath13 is a simple _ random walk _ ) , and @xmath14 ( denoting the _ drift _ ) and @xmath15 ( denoting the _ volatility _ ) are constants .",
    "now , if one introduces the _ risk - free rate of return _",
    "@xmath16 , then one can derive the _ black - scholes equation _ that must be satisfied by the price @xmath17 of the option : @xmath18 as an example , we report the black - scholes formula concerning the price of a european call option for a non - dividend paying underlying stock .",
    "it is given by : @xmath19 the price of a corresponding put option is instead given by : @xmath20 the parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 in eqs .",
    "( [ call ] ) and ( [ put ] ) are defined as @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively , while @xmath25 is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution @xmath26    it should be observed that the model presented above contains several simplifications and idealizations that can hardly be realized in the real stock market .",
    "moreover , the claimed independence of the black - scholes model from risk is only theoretical , since following the model exposes the user to some unexpected risk . notwithstanding this",
    ", empirical tests generally show a good accordance with the predictions following from the model , so that the black - scholes model is , together with its refinements to real cases , the predominant model of option pricing in quantitative finance .    a crucial assumption for the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ blackscholesequation ] ) is the _ random walk hypothesis _ underlying eq .",
    "( [ randomwalk ] ) , that is , the assumption that assets prices evolve according to a classical random walk . roughly speaking , the closing price of an asset in a financial market , such as wall street , should be determined by a coin flip , hence it should be a classical kolmogorovian process .",
    "this random walk hypothesis has characterized the financial derivatives modelling and valuation in the banks and financial institutions , and is strictly linked with the so - called _ efficient market hypothesis _ , that is , the assumption that financial markets are ` informationally efficient ' and prices of traded assets instantly change to reflect new public information .",
    "it is evident that both random walk and efficient market hypotheses refer to ideal situations , but their validity rests on the fact that it is practically impossible to exploit market inefficiencies at the level of assets prices",
    ".    however , in the last years several authors have pointed out that there are some situations in finance where the deviations from the black - scholes predictions can not be attributed to random fluctuations but , rather , some of the underlying hypotheses of the model could not hold @xcite . in particular , the random walk hypothesis is put at stake .",
    "these authors maintain , by referring to existing experimental data , that the random walk model works well in static situations where no phase transition occurs . whenever something happens , such as in a _ stock market crash _ , the random walk model fails , while coherent effects appear . in these exceptional situations ,",
    "deviations are not averaged out , but seem to reinforce themselves , and people start acting as a group with correlated actions ( _ herding _ ) . as a consequence , alternative models to the black - scholes equations",
    "have been proposed and some descriptions have been inspired by quantum mechanics @xcite . an analogy is assumed with statistical mechanics .",
    "it is indeed well known that if we consider a gas with many particles and the temperature is high , then the gas is nondegenerate and the classical maxwell - boltzmann distribution is a good approximation of its behavior .",
    "viceversa , if the temperature becomes very low , then quantum coherence and other quantum effects appear , the gas becomes degenerate and must be described within quantum , e.g. , fermi - dirac or bose - einstein , statistics .",
    "these scholars suggest that similar phenomena occur in the stock market ( herding , stampede , etc . ) whenever some parameters reach critical values .",
    "we will prove in the next sections that a similar conclusion can be attained if one adopts a different perspective , and explain why a quantum - like formalism is needed to model financial systems .",
    "we have seen in the previous section that standard option pricing models are based on classical stochastic processes . in particular , the value of an option is a suitable function of some set of random variables .",
    "one could then observe that the formalism of quantum mechanics and the quantum probability model could supply more general and flexible tools to model the pricing of financial assets ( options , stocks , shares , etc . ) .",
    "but , there are stronger reasons for using quantum structures in finance .",
    "it is a basic doctrine in quantum mechanics that a property , e.g. , the value of an observable , of a physical entity in a given state can not be considered as a preexisting feature of the entity , as it is usually assumed in classical physics . on the contrary ,",
    "the property is actualized in a measurement process and can be different if a different measurement context is considered .",
    "therefore , the measurement context introduces a nondeterministic change of state of the entity that is measured as a consequence of the interaction between the entity itself and the measuring apparatus .",
    "moreover , in a measurement a transition occurs from ` potential ' to ` actual ' , that is , a property that was only potential before the measurement becomes actual after it , and viceversa .",
    "one typically says in this case that the measured entity is in a _",
    "potentiality state _ with respect to the measurement context .",
    "as a consequence , quantum probability can not be interpreted as formalizing the subjective ignorance about the actual state of the entity , as it occurs for classical ( kolmogorovian ) probability and statistical mechanics , but it is rather caused by the presence of a lack of knowledge ( _ fluctuations _ ) concerning how context interacts with the entity that is considered .",
    "the ensuing formalization of this _ quantum potentiality _ entails that the quantum probability model is non - kolmogorovian @xcite .",
    "the brussels group has inquired into the conceptual foundations of quantum mechanics for years to provide an operational axiomatization of this theory .",
    "this research led the authors to elaborate a _",
    "state context property _",
    "( _ scop _ ) formalism to describe any ( not necessarily physical ) entity @xcite .",
    "the scop formalism recovers classical and quantum mechanics generalizing both of them , and has been used in previous investigations to model concepts and their combinations @xcite .",
    "the probability arises in it as a consequence of the lack of knowledge about how context influences the entity under study ( _ hidden measurement formalism _ ) @xcite .",
    "this formalism is able to describe any kind of quantum - like potentiality structures .",
    "an example of the above situations has been found outside physics , i.e. the opinion poll model @xcite .",
    "a quantum - like potentiality structure occurs in an opinion poll because two types of questions are possible .",
    "_ type i _ : e.g. , the question ` are you a smoker ? ' : answer ` yes ' or ` no ' is predetermined , independent of the happening of the opinion poll .    in this case , the answer only changes the knowledge of the interrogator , hence it is a question with a predetermined answer ( _ classical question _ ) .    _",
    "type ii _ : a question where the answer is not necessarily predetermined , as follows .",
    "\\(i ) ` are you a proponent of the use of nuclear energy ? ' .",
    "\\(ii ) ` do you think it would be a good idea to legalize soft - drugs ? ' .",
    "\\(iii ) ` do you think it is better for people to live in a capitalistic system ? ' .    in these cases ,",
    "the opinion of an interviewee is possibly not determined before the opinion poll takes place , but it is formed during the process of the opinion poll .",
    "hence , the interviewee s mind starts from a potentiality state , and the overall interaction process during the ` measurement of the opinion ' realizes a final answer ` yes ' or ` no ' .",
    "we say that this type of question is _",
    "nonclassical_. it has been shown that the ensuing probability structure is non - kolmogorovian and admits a generalized quantum or , equivalently , quantum - like , representation @xcite .",
    "a careful analysis shows that similar situations can be found in the stock market .",
    "indeed , it is reasonable to suppose that prices of assets are not predetermined , but they depend on the simultaneous happenings of human decisions to buy and/or sell . in this perspective , the structural and dynamical nature of an asset and its relation with ` the price of the asset ' is similar to nonclassical questions in the quantum opinion poll model .",
    "more specifically , the equivalent of a classical question with a predetermined answer is a question related to the price of a common material object sold in a shop , where the price is fixed apriori . as a consequence , a classical model is satisfactory for the buying and selling of normal goods , for one likes thinking that the prices of goods are also given when no selling / buying takes place . on the contrary ,",
    "the equivalent of a nonclassical question with a non - predetermined answer is a question related to the price of an asset in the financial market , where there is a ` bidding for the price ' during the trading process .",
    "notwithstanding this , in standard economic theories one usually refers to the efficient market hypothesis ( see the first section ) . if information is spread ` efficiently ' , or locally ,",
    "prices are set in a correct way , and the market evolves toward a state where the efficient market hypothesis is again satisfied . in this case , which is typical of a normal market situation , a nonclassical effect due to the non - predetermined price of an asset and contextual influence by decision context ` wanting to buy and/or sell it ' is small .",
    "thus , the use of classical black - scholes equations for the assets prices seems to be justified .",
    "the situation is deeply different if one considers what happens during a market crash or in an economical crisis . in these cases , indeed , information about buying / selling is spread non - locally , the efficient market hypothesis does not hold any longer , and the nonclassical effects due to contextual decision making can not be neglected . as a consequence , one could say that classical stochastic equations only describe the average evolution of option prices if ` nothing special happens ' . on the contrary , if ` catastrophic ' events ( crash ) , or situations of high volatility , occur , the nonclassical effects appear , and quantum structures are necessary .",
    "the deep reason why the price of an asset is not a priori fixed but it is realized in a trading process will be clear from the following .",
    "the analysis undertaken in the previous section suggests that a more refined model of the stock market could be based on the quantum formalism , or on a generalization of it . in this section",
    "the scop formalism will be presented to put forward such a possible generalization .",
    "suppose that the entity @xmath27 under investigation is a stock .",
    "at a specific moment , the stock @xmath27 is described by a pure state @xmath28 representing the reality of @xmath27 at that time .",
    "a context @xmath29 for the stock @xmath27 is a part of the outside reality influencing @xmath27 in such a way that the state @xmath27 is changed .",
    "the context @xmath29 describes , for example , the whole of humans decisions in a trading process , in which @xmath27 is bought / sold . in general , the interaction between the stock @xmath27 and the context @xmath29 determines a change of the state @xmath28 of @xmath27 to a state @xmath30 ( by analogy with the state transition of a quantum entity in a measurement process , we call _ collapse _ the state transition of @xmath27 ) .",
    "we denote the set of states and contexts for @xmath27 by @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "if @xmath28 does not change under the context @xmath29 we say that @xmath28 is an _ eigenstate _ for @xmath29 , otherwise we say that @xmath28 is a _ potentiality state _ for @xmath29 .",
    "the probability that the state @xmath28 changes to state @xmath30 under the context @xmath29 is denoted by @xmath33 . obviously , a state transition of this kind is generally a stochastic process .",
    "a property @xmath34 of a stock @xmath27 is an element of reality that @xmath27 can possess independently of the context influencing @xmath11 .",
    "a property @xmath34 for the stock @xmath27 is , for example , the price of the stock at a given time .",
    "we denote the set of properties of @xmath27 by @xmath35 .",
    "if the stock @xmath27 possesses a property @xmath34 we say that @xmath34 is _ actual _ for @xmath27 , otherwise we say that @xmath34 is _",
    "potential_. a stock @xmath27 in a given state @xmath28 possesses a set of properties that are actual .",
    "properties that are actual for @xmath27 being in a specific state can be potential when @xmath27 is in another state .",
    "this defines a function @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the set of all subsets of @xmath38 , which maps each state @xmath28 into a set @xmath39 of all properties that are actual in this state . by introducing the function",
    "@xmath40 we replace the locution `` the property @xmath34 is actual when the stock @xmath27 is in the state @xmath28 '' , by `` @xmath41 '' .",
    "if the state @xmath28 of @xmath27 is changed under influence of the context @xmath29 into the state @xmath30 , then the set @xmath39 of actual properties in state @xmath28 is changed into the set @xmath42 of actual properties in state @xmath30 . in particular , we say that the stock @xmath27 in the state @xmath28 _ displays _ a price ranging between the value @xmath43 and the value @xmath44 in a trading process if the property @xmath34 : ` having a price between @xmath43 and @xmath44 ' is actual when @xmath27 is in the state @xmath28 .",
    "then , the trading process changes the state @xmath28 of @xmath27 into a state @xmath30 which is such that @xmath45 .",
    "having introduced the foregoing basic definitions and mappings , we are now ready to associate a given _ stock _ @xmath27 with a _ scop system _ , that is , a set @xmath31 of states , a set @xmath46 of contexts , a set @xmath38 of properties , and two functions @xmath14 and @xmath40 .",
    "the function @xmath14 is defined as @xmath47 $ ] , @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the probability that the stock in state @xmath28 changes to state @xmath30 under influence of the context @xmath29 , and such that the context @xmath29 changes to context @xmath50 . hence @xmath14 describes the structure of the contextual interaction of the stock under study .",
    "the function @xmath40 is defined as @xmath36 , @xmath51 , where @xmath39 denotes the set of all properties that are actual in state @xmath28 . hence @xmath40 describes the internal structure of the entity or , better , how properties depend on the different states the stock can be in .",
    "the above definition can be extended to different interacting stocks in order to describe a financial market .",
    "it follows from the preceding treatment that a given stock has generally not a definite price , even if it is in a definite state at a specific instant of time . on the contrary ,",
    "the stock s price is realized in a trading process , which is generally a stochastic process and depends on the contextual interactions in humans decisions of buying / selling .",
    "the analogy with the behavior of a quantum entity interacting with a measurement context is thus evident , and supports the idea that a quantum - like formalism should be employed to model stocks transformations .",
    "the nonclassical character of stock prices can be better understood by elaborating a macroscopic contextual model that reproduces the fluctuations of a given stock in a financial market .",
    "we will adapt a model that has already been worked out and used to identify the presence of quantum structures , and has been called the _ sphere model _ @xcite .",
    "the sphere model consists of a physical entity @xmath27 that is a material point particle @xmath52 moving on the surface of a sphere that we denote by @xmath53 , with center @xmath54 and radius 1 .",
    "the entity @xmath27 describes the stock that is considered .",
    "the unit vector @xmath55 where @xmath52 is located on @xmath53 represents the pure state @xmath56 of @xmath27 ( see fig .",
    "for every point @xmath57 , the following measurement @xmath58 can be introduced .",
    "let @xmath59 be the diametrically opposite point with respect to @xmath60 , and let us install a piece of elastic of 2 units of length such that it is fixed with one of its endpoints in @xmath61 and the other endpoint in @xmath62 .",
    "once the elastic is installed , the particle @xmath52 falls from its original place @xmath55 orthogonally onto the elastic , and sticks on it ( fig .",
    "1b ) . then the elastic breaks somewhere and @xmath52 , attached to one of the two pieces of the elastic ( fig .",
    "1c ) , moves to one of the two endpoints @xmath61 or @xmath62 ( fig .",
    "1d ) . depending on whether the particle @xmath52 arrives at @xmath61 ( as in fig .",
    "1 ) or at @xmath62 , we attribute the outcome @xmath63 or @xmath64 to @xmath65 .",
    "the elastic installed between @xmath61 and @xmath62 plays the role of a ( measurement ) context for the entity @xmath27 .",
    "the measurement @xmath58 describes a process of trading of the given stock .",
    "more precisely , we say that the outcome @xmath63 is obtained if the price of the stock ranges between the values @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "conversely , we say that the outcome @xmath64 is obtained if the price of the stock lies outside the interval between @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "let us now consider elastics that break in different ways depending on their physical construction or on other environmental happenings .",
    "we can describe such a general situation by a classical probability distribution @xmath66 \\longrightarrow [ 0 , + \\infty]\\ ] ] such that @xmath67 is the probability that the elastic breaks in the region @xmath68 $ ] .",
    "we also have : @xmath69 } \\rho(x ) d x = 1,\\ ] ] which expresses the fact that the elastic always breaks during a measurement .",
    "a measurement @xmath65 characterized by a given distribution @xmath70 will be called a _",
    "@xmath70-measurement _ and denoted by @xmath71 in the following .",
    "a @xmath70-measurement is a hidden measurement for the entity @xmath27 , in the sense that the probabilities associated with the outcomes @xmath63 and @xmath64 can be interpreted as due to @xmath70 .",
    "then , the distribution @xmath70 describes the lack of knowledge about humans decisions with respect to the given trading process , hence the subjective lack of knowledge about how humans interact with respect to the given stock .",
    "let us calculate the probabilities involved in a @xmath70-measurement .",
    "the transition probabilities that the particle @xmath52 arrives at point @xmath61 ( hence the outcome of the measurement is @xmath63 ) and @xmath62 ( hence the outcome of the measurement is @xmath64 ) under the influence of the measurement @xmath71 , are respectively given by : @xmath72    therefore , the process of buying / selling of the stock @xmath27 can be considered as the result of a contextual interaction between @xmath27 itself and the surrounding conceptual landscape made up of the agents decisions .",
    "this sentence needs some comments .",
    "the fact that the decisions taken by humans with respect to specific situations have a nonclassical character is manifestly revealed by several paradoxes in economics and decision theory ( _ allais _ and _ ellsberg paradoxes _ , _ conjunction fallacy _ , _ disjunction effect _ , etc . ) .",
    "these drawbacks show that real subjects are not only guided by classical logic and probability theory in their decisions . on the contrary",
    ", subjects also follow a different way of thinking , which has a conceptual nature , depends on their contextual interaction with the given situation , and is structurally connected with the quantum formalism , as we have argued in a number of papers @xcite .",
    "more specifically , in these investigations , we have put forward the hypothesis of the presence of two structured and superposed layers in human thought : a _ classical logical layer _ , that can be modeled by using a classical kolmogorovian probability framework , and a _ quantum conceptual layer _",
    ", that can instead be modeled by using the probabilistic formalism of quantum mechanics .",
    "the thought process in the latter layer is given form under the influence of the totality of the surrounding conceptual landscape , hence context effects are fundamental in this layer @xcite .",
    "it is important to observe that the probabilities in eq .",
    "( [ transition ] ) can not be cast into a unique kolmogorovian scheme .",
    "this result can be proved by referring to _",
    "pitowsky s polytopes _ , or to _ bell - like inequalities _ @xcite . furthermore ,",
    "if we limit ourselves to consider uniform probability distributions @xmath70 , then the probabilities in eq .",
    "( [ transition ] ) become the standard quantum probabilities for spin measurements , since our sphere model is a model for a spin 1/2 quantum particle @xcite . a proof that the probability model of a spin 1/2 quantum particle is not kolmogorovian is due to accardi and fedullo @xcite , and we refer to their paper for technical details .",
    "the sphere model presented above is , obviously , idealized and oversimplified .",
    "but it already shows that the monetary transitions in a trading process for a stock can not be modeled by using classical kolmogorovian probabilities , because of their intrinsic contextuality , and that a non - kolmogorovian quantum - like framework is necessary .",
    "moreover , the presence of elastics is , in our opinion , a good illustration to express the intuition that , when an asset is not bought / sold , there is a kind of ` tension on the price of the asset ' .",
    "this tension reproduces what happens in the moments between the times in which a buying / selling takes place .",
    "the breaking of the elastics then describes the price assignment to the asset , that is , the collapse .",
    "modern quantitative finance rests on classical stochastic models of market behavior .",
    "more precisely , the black - scholes equations are used to model prices of assets , options and stocks , their solutions rule the stock market at equilibrium , and deviations from these solutions are usually considered as random fluctuations from equilibrium .",
    "the black - scholes equations are founded on the random walk hypothesis .",
    "but an explanation does not exist either for the utilization of this hypothesis or for its violation in specific situations .",
    "it can be shown by referring to the experimental data existing in the literature that the random walk model is a good approximation of the market reality in static situations , that is , when no special , i.e. out of the ordinary set of events with respect to stock market dynamics , takes place .",
    "whenever such extra - ordinary events take place , e.g. , events leading to financial and/or economical crisis , the random walk model fails .",
    "often coherent effects start to appear .",
    "eventually it occurs that , for example , a herd dynamics is established , or a destructive stampede comes into being .",
    "we argue that a situation similar to quantum statistics may occur in finance : whenever news of world importance is spread around , it cognitively aligns human choices and preferences , which creates a quantum - like coherence , hence nonclassical effects . in this case",
    ", the quantum coherence is generated by the global nature of the news items .",
    "if news items remain local , in the sense that their effects are not distributed over the world globe , then quantum coherence can not emerge , and the stock market is well approximated by a classical random walk . on the contrary , whenever news is non - local and has a global effect , e.g. , in a financial crisis , coherent quantum - like phenomena may occur , such as herding or stampede .    basing ourselves on a scop formalism , which supplies an operational foundation of quantum mechanics , and on a hidden measurement formalism , which interprets quantum probabilities as due to fluctuations in the interaction between entity and context , we have provided strong arguments to maintain that a given stock has no definite price when it is not traded , whereas its price is actualized whenever a buying / selling process occurs .",
    "this actualization is a consequence of the overall conceptual landscape made up of the whole of humans decisions . in some cases",
    ", it may occur that these contextual effects can be neglected , thus classical models can be applied .",
    "but , relevant situations also exist in which these contextual effects can not be neglected .",
    "a quantum - like description is instead needed in these cases .",
    "the process of trading in a stock market has been concretely illustrated by means of an elastic sphere model which is contextual and has a non - kolmogorovian quantum - like structure . as a consequence",
    ", our approach provides a theoretical support to the development of quantum models for the stock market .",
    "the results presented in this paper are part of an ongoing activity of our brussels research group to identify the classical or non classical nature of phenomena that are traditionally studies in different domains of science @xcite . in this respect",
    "we also mention that there is actually a successfully growing international research activity identifying quantum structures in domains of science different from the micro - world .",
    "interesting results have been obtained with respect to economics @xcite as we mentioned already in this paper . but more extensive results where obtained in psychology and cognitive science , more specifically in the modeling of concepts and their combinations @xcite , and in decision theory @xcite , and in situations related to semantic spaces @xcite such as problems information retrieval @xcite",

    "<S> modern approaches to stock pricing in quantitative finance are typically founded on the _ black - scholes model _ and the underlying _ random walk hypothesis_. empirical data indicate that this hypothesis works well in stable situations but , in abrupt transitions such as during an economical crisis , the random walk model fails and alternative descriptions are needed . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason , several proposals have been recently forwarded which are based on the formalism of quantum mechanics . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we apply the _ scop formalism _ , elaborated to provide an operational foundation of quantum mechanics , to the stock market . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that a stock market is an intrinsically contextual system where agents decisions globally influence the market system and stocks prices , determining a nonclassical behavior . </S>",
    "<S> more specifically , we maintain that a given stock does not generally have a definite value , e.g. , a price , but its value is actualized as a consequence of the contextual interactions in the trading process . </S>",
    "<S> this contextual influence is responsible of the non - kolmogorovian quantum - like behavior of the market at a statistical level . </S>",
    "<S> then , we propose a _ sphere model _ within our _ hidden measurement formalism _ that describes a buying / selling process of a stock and shows that it is intuitively reasonable to assume that the stock has not a definite price until it is traded . </S>",
    "<S> this result is relevant in our opinion since it provides a theoretical support to the use of quantum models in finance . </S>"
