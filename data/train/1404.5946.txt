    "since the discovery of the accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite , we have learned that most of the universe content is a kind of cosmic fluid with negative pressure known as dark energy .",
    "furthermore , even the dominant contribution to the matter content is to a high degree unknown , being described by a weakly interacting component which has received the name of dark matter .",
    "this present knowledge about the composition of the universe has been possible thanks to precise measurements including for instance cmb temperature power spectrum @xcite , large - scale structures correlation functions ( baos @xcite ) or high - redshift type ia supernovae @xcite . to the best knowledge of the authors a theoretical explanation of the values or",
    "even the presence of these dark components is absent .",
    "considering the simplest model of dark energy , i.e.  a cosmological constant , it is believed that this term has classical and quantum contributions @xcite .",
    "the classical one may just be taken as a parameter of the theory since the most general form of the general relativity equations may include this contribution without breaking any of the fundamental assumptions of the theory such as general covariance or energy - momentum conservation @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the quantum contribution is expected from quantum field theory grounds . however , as it is widely known , the theoretical predictions of its value and the measured one differ in many orders of magnitude .",
    "this difference may be compensated by the classical contribution leaving us with the observed value .",
    "the fine tuning necessary for this to happen is one of the drawbacks that have brought us to the cosmological constant problem .    however , many of the standard arguments about the contribution of the zero - point quantum fluctuations to the cosmological constant are based on calculations performed in flat space - time , in which the vacuum state is assumed to respect the lorentz invariance of the minkowski space - time .",
    "in fact , when taking into account that the actual geometry of the universe is not minkowskian and moving to a robertson - walker background , new contributions to the vacuum energy - momentum tensor appear @xcite and new aspects of the problem are revealed which were not apparent in the flat space - time calculations @xcite .",
    "one of the major problems in calculating the vacuum energy density is the divergent integral over the fourier modes appearing in the canonical quantization procedure .",
    "several methods have been proposed in the literature in order to obtain finite renormalized results .",
    "thus in general , the physical renormalized vacuum expectation value of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath0 is obtained from the divergent bare quantities by subtracting the regularized divergences by means of appropriate counterterms , i.e @xmath1 different schemes have been proposed to obtain the regularized bare quantities .",
    "for instance , in flat space - time one of the simplest possibilities is to use a cutoff on the three - momentum of the modes @xmath2 .",
    "however , it has been argued @xcite that the maximum value of the three - momentum is not a lorentz invariant quantity and therefore , the regularized bare contributions break the lorentz symmetry of minkowski space - time . indeed ,",
    "in the case of a real minimally coupled scalar field , the regularized bare quantities read @xmath3 with the leading contributions @xmath4",
    "@xmath5 i.e. in @xmath6 only the logarithmic term would be proportional to @xmath7 .",
    "this problem is avoided in other regularization schemes , such as dimensional regularization , which preserve the underlying symmetries of the theory .",
    "dimensional regularization has been carried out in flat space - time @xcite yielding a cosmological constant contribution with @xmath8 , where again for scalar fields of @xmath9 with @xmath10 the space - time dimension , @xmath11 the euler - mascheroni constant and @xmath12 the renormalization scale . in curved space - time",
    ", it can be seen that the vacuum expectation value of the energy - momentum tensor is no longer a simple cosmological constant term , but in general is a nonlocal functional of the metric tensor .",
    "the calculation of the divergent local part in dimensional regularization shows that there is a contribution that behaves as a cosmological constant together with other local and conserved tensors which depend on the curvatures .",
    "exact results including also the finite contributions have been obtained only for conformally trivial systems @xcite .",
    "notice , however , that strictly speaking the problem we mentioned with the cutoff regularization would not be present in a robertson - walker cosmological background , since in this case lorentz invariance is not a symmetry of the background metric . as a matter of fact",
    ", in a robertson - walker background there is a special frame of reference ( that at rest with the cmb ) which is most suitable for calculations . in this case , a three - dimensional momentum cutoff defined over the homogeneous and isotropic spatial sections may have a more satisfying interpretation , since it respects the symmetries of the background geometry .    accordingly",
    ", several recent works have focused on the possibility of using different kinds of cutoff regularizations in robertson - walker backgrounds .",
    "thus in @xcite a cutoff scale was used in the context of supersymmetric models , and in @xcite a covariant cutoff scheme was proposed in general curved space - times .",
    "on the other hand , one may use a cutoff to perform the integration and consider different renormalization prescriptions according to the counterterms included .",
    "thus for instance , in @xcite the vacuum energy density obtained in a flat space - time is subtracted in a similar process to the definition of the arnowitt - deser - misner mass on asymptotically flat space - times .",
    "notice that in general , different renormalization schemes may provide different renormalized expressions . on general grounds",
    "@xcite quantum field theory makes no prediction about the actual value of @xmath0 , just in the same way as it does not predict the physical ( renormalized ) value of the electron charge or mass , but these quantities can only be obtained from experimental measurements . despite the fact that the physical value of the vacuum energy can only be determined from observations , there are , however , several conditions that from a purely phenomenological point of view ( and neglecting possible fine - tuned cancellations with other contributions ) a physical renormalized energy - momentum tensor should satisfy    * @xmath0 should be covariant and conserved .",
    "notice that in a curved space - time a covariant expectation value of the energy - momentum tensor can involve not only the metric tensor but also other tensors such as curvatures or any other object which transforms covariantly under diffeomorphisms @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , regarding conservation , in general , if nongravitational interactions of the scalar field are taken into account , then vacuum energy could be coupled to other components and the conservation should be required for the total energy - momentum tensor . in any case , in this work we limit ourselves to the simplest noninteracting case and therefore the vacuum energy - momentum tensor should be independently conserved . * @xmath13 , i.e. in order to have phenomenologically viable contributions , the vacuum energy should be smaller than the dominant component of the universe at early times . only at late times , and if we assume vacuum energy to play a role in the dark matter or dark energy problems , its value could be comparable to the critical density @xmath14 .    in this work",
    "we will explore the possibility of constructing the renormalized vacuum energy momentum by means of a _ comoving _ three - momentum cutoff .",
    "unlike previous works which focused on _ physical _ cutoff scales , the use of this kind of regularization provides covariant expressions for the regularized integrals and also guarantees that the bare energy - momentum tensor is conserved .",
    "accordingly , we do not need to include noncovariant counterterms in order to render the final results covariant .",
    "this can easily be seen in the following example .",
    "let us consider the cutoff regularized bare energy - momentum tensor for minimally coupled massless scalar fields in a robertson - walker background @xcite . in this case @xmath15",
    "where @xmath16 @xmath17 , 1 , 2/3 in the de sitter , radiation and matter eras respectively .",
    "here @xmath2 is a constant physical momentum cutoff .",
    "notice that indeed the use of the physical cutoff prevents the bare energy - momentum tensor from being conserved .",
    "this is clearly seen for example from the dominant quartic terms whose effective equation of state would be @xmath18 , i.e. corresponding to radiation , but , however , they do not scale with @xmath19 . as shown in @xcite",
    "this is not a problem , since the bare quantities are not observable and by adding appropriate ( noncovariant ) counterterms it would always be possible to render the renormalized energy - momentum tensor conserved , provided @xmath20 .",
    "however , if we consider instead a constant comoving cutoff @xmath21 , the above results read @xmath22 which yield a conserved bare energy - momentum tensor as expected according to our previous discussion . indeed , notice that now the leading quartic term scales as expected according to its equation of state , i.e. as radiation , and the same is true for the rest of terms .",
    "since each of the divergent contributions ( quartic , quadratic or logarithmic ) is conserved independently , it would be possible in principle to add different conserved counterterms for each of them . in the simplest possibility",
    ", the counterterms are just given by the same expressions ( [ bare1 ] ) and ( [ bare2 ] ) but in which the modes have been integrated from some constant comoving renormalization scale @xmath23 up to the ultraviolet cutoff @xmath21 , i.e. just subtracting the contributions of the modes in the range @xmath24 $ ] . then in this case",
    "the physical interpretation of the renormalized quantities is straightforward , since only the modes in the unsubtracted range @xmath25 $ ] will contribute .",
    "thus , we can simply write @xmath26    notice that @xmath23 is understood as a limit on the frequency of the fourier modes which actually contribute to the vacuum energy and in general can be different from the standard quantum field theory uv cutoff which sets the range of validity of the theory . thus for instance in @xcite @xmath23 is obtained by demanding that no state in the hilbert space can have an energy such that the corresponding schwarzschild radius exceeds the hubble ( or the event ) horizon , i.e. modes which would have collapsed in a black hole are excluded in the computation of the vacuum energy .",
    "this is a generic prediction of so called holographic @xcite but also of nonholographic @xcite entropy bounds on the number of physical quantum states for any gravitating system .",
    "these models generically predict @xmath23 much smaller than the quantum field theory cutoff , thus alleviating the cosmological constant problem . in this work , however , we will not assume any particular scenario for the determination of @xmath23 , instead we will adopt a phenomenological point of view leaving it as a free parameter to be fixed by observations .",
    "when trying to extend the renormalization procedure we have just described to the case of massive fields , an additional scale @xmath27 appears in the problem which opens up different regimes for the vacuum energy behavior .",
    "thus , in the case in which the comoving mass is larger than the renormalization scale , i.e. @xmath28 , we will show that the effective equation of state of vacuum energy is that of nonrelativistic matter .",
    "in order to obtain this kind of results , it will be necessary to determine the behavior of the integrals not only in the high - momenta ( uv ) regime , as is usually considered in the literature , but also for low momenta ( ir ) .",
    "we will show that the dark matter behavior of vacuum energy also holds at the level of perturbations , thus opening up the quite unexpected possibility for the vacuum energy to form large scale structures .",

    "the corresponding klein - gordon equation reads @xmath30 thus , the field @xmath31 can be fourier expanded as @xmath32 the scalar field can be quantized by letting @xmath33 and @xmath34 be operators which satisfy the usual commutation relations @xmath35=\\delta^{(3)}({\\bf p}-{\\bf q})\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] introducing @xmath36 by @xmath37 eq .",

    "if the mass term is negligible with the kinetic and gradient terms of the same order of magnitude ( as it happens for instance in uv regime @xmath48 ) then @xmath49 , i.e we get a radiation behavior .",

    "a minimally coupled scalar field with mass @xmath124 obeys the same equation that a conformal coupled field with mass @xmath125 .",

    "it is to be noted that again the evolution in time fits with the corresponding equation of state , which implies that the renormalized energy - momentum tensor is conserved .",
    "hence , the vacuum energy density of a massive scalar field in the uv behaves as a radiation fluid , a @xmath66 fluid and a cosmological constant .",
    "notice that any of these contributions could be removed by choosing appropriate counterterms as discussed in the introduction .",
    "the radiation term does not depend on the mass while the other ones increase in absolute value as the mass increases .",
    "it is seen that for a massless field @xmath135 or a massless conformal field @xmath136 the cosmological constant contribution vanishes .",
    "this result for a massless field is also obtained using a dimensional regularization scheme @xcite in a flat space - time .",
    "however , the second case is a proper feature of the curved space - time we are considering , where the minimal and conformal couplings differ by a redefinition of the field mass . the term that evolves as @xmath123 does not vanish for any physical value of @xmath75 .",
    "as time evolves , the uv condition @xmath127 would be violated and the approximation used in the previous section would no longer be valid .",

    "we will work in the longitudinal gauge , for which the perturbed metric reads @xmath176\\ , \\text{d}\\eta^2 - \\left[1 - 2\\psi(\\eta,{\\bf x})\\right]\\,\\text{d}{\\bf x}^2 \\right\\}\\,.\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\]]the scalar field can also be expanded around the unperturbed solution as @xmath177 where @xmath178 satisfies @xmath179 and the total field can be shown to satisfy up to first order in perturbations @xmath180    in order to quantize the perturbed field , we will look for a complete orthonormal set of solutions of the above equation .",
    "for that purpose , we will try a wkb ansatz for the solutions in the form @xmath181 where @xmath182 is a slowly evolving function of @xmath69 and @xmath183 , whereas @xmath184 is a rapidly evolving phase .",
    "notice that such an approximation would work in the ir regime in which @xmath185 is larger than any other scale in the problem .",
    "these mode solutions should be orthonormal with respect to the scalar product @xmath186\\sqrt{g_\\sigma } \\text{d}\\sigma^\\mu \\nonumber   \\label{scalar}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath187 with @xmath188 a unit temporal vector directed to the future and orthogonal to the @xmath189 hypersurface @xmath190 , i.e. @xmath191 and @xmath192 to first order in perturbations .",
    "thus we have @xmath193 so that we can quantize @xmath194 in such a way that the corresponding creation and annihilation operators satisfy the usual commutation relation @xmath35=\\delta^{(3)}({\\bf p}-{\\bf q})\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the positive frequency solutions of the unperturbed equation with momentum @xmath195 can be written as @xmath196 so that we can expand the perturbed fields as @xmath197 and substituting in ( [ pert ] ) , we get to the leading @xmath198 order in the wkb expansion @xmath199 we now expand this equation in metric perturbations so that to the lowest order we get @xmath200 and to the first order in perturbations @xmath201 the next term @xmath202 of ( [ pert ] ) in the wkb expansion reads @xmath203 which can be expanded in turn in metric perturbations , so that to the lowest order we get @xmath204 whose solution implies that @xmath205 with @xmath206 the normalization constant .",
    "to first order in metric perturbations we get @xmath207 in order to solve the perturbed equations ( [ leadingpert ] ) and ( [ nonleadingpert ] ) , notice that according to the previous discussion , we are interested in the case in which @xmath208 . thus neglecting terms @xmath209 we can obtain from ( [ leadingpert ] ) @xmath210 using this result and ( [ f ] ) , we can rewrite ( [ nonleadingpert ] ) as @xmath211 however , in the limit @xmath212 we can neglect the last term , so that finally we get using ( [ fsol ] ) @xmath213 we see that these solutions satisfy the normalization condition ( [ normalization ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , the energy - momentum reads @xmath214 thus to first order in perturbations we get @xmath215 @xmath216 thus the first term in the energy density reads @xmath217 the second term is negligible in the limit @xmath212 , i.e. @xmath218 , so that we can ignore it , and the last term reads @xmath219    thus , adding together the contributions we see that to lowest order in perturbations we recover the results derived in previous sections , @xmath220 whereas for the perturbation we get @xmath221 and to first order in perturbations , we see that the contributions for the pressure from the kinetic ( [ kin ] ) and potential ( [ pot ] ) terms cancel each other so that @xmath222 thus , for the corresponding speed of sound we get @xmath223    notice that the @xmath224 components with @xmath225 are @xmath226 which can be neglected when compared to @xmath227 since as commented before if @xmath228 , it is possible to neglect the spatial derivatives of the field @xmath29 as compared to the temporal ones . for this reason , using einstein equations the anisotropic stress vanishes , i.e. @xmath229 .    in the matter dominated era , for a fluid with @xmath230 , we expect @xmath231 both on sub - hubble and super - hubble scales , and @xmath232 .",
    "notice that this is indeed what the solution of ( [ densityp ] ) for @xmath233 predicts since in that case @xmath234 where we have made use of the fact that for sub - hubble modes @xmath235 so that the second term dominates .",
    "thus we see that not only at the background level does the vacuum energy behave as nonrelativistic matter , but also density perturbations have negligible speed of sound on sub - hubble scales , which implies the quite unexpected result that structures could be formed out of the vacuum . from the density perturbation and the total density",
    "we obtain the following result for the density contrast : @xmath236 which is cutoff independent and valid for any scale . as a matter of fact",
    ", it agrees with the standard result for hydrodynamical fluids @xcite . from these results we see",
    "that , as in standard cold dark matter scenarios , the growth of structures is suppressed during the radiation dominated era and the density contrast can only start to grow in the matter era .",
    "in this work we have explored the possibility of defining the renormalized vacuum energy - momentum tensor for massive fields in an expanding universe by means of a constant comoving momentum cutoff .",
    "although we have illustrated this idea with scalar fields , the results would hold for any massive bosonic or fermionic degree of freedom .",
    "we have shown that this regularization procedure allows one to obtain a covariantly conserved renormalized energy - momentum tensor without the need of introducing noncovariant counterterms .",
    "the behavior of the vacuum energy is then shown to depend on the relative size of the comoving mass of field ( @xmath237 ) with respect to the cutoff . for large cutoffs , the uv modes dominate and the vacuum energy has the different contributions which have already been discussed in the literature @xcite . in the case of low cutoffs ( large masses ) or late times ,",
    "the ir modes dominate and the vacuum energy behaves as nonrelativistic matter .",
    "this result holds in any robertson - walker background and seems to be independent of the uv behavior .",
    "moreover , vacuum energy density perturbations in this regime are shown to have a low speed of sound which implies that large scale structures could be seeded by vacuum energy fluctuations .",
