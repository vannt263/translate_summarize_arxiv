    "on the exact solutions of integrable models , there is a new classification way recently based on the property of the spectral parameter @xcite : if the spectral parameter is positive , the related solution of the nonlinear system is called positon which is usually expressed by means of the triangle functions . if the spectral parameter is negtive , the related solution of the nonlinear system is called negaton which is usually expressed with help of the hyperbolic functions . the term",
    " positon \" and  negaton \" may be pursued back to matveev et al @xcite though the singular solutions had been studied earlier @xcite .",
    "the so - called complexiton , which is expressed by combinations of the triangle functions and the hyperbolic functions , is related to the complex spectral parameters .",
    "it is meaningful that the complexiton exists for _ real integrable systems .",
    "the most of known positon solutions are singular . for various important integrable systems such as the kdv equation",
    "there is no nonsingular positon found .",
    "the negaton can be both singular and nonsingular .",
    "especially nonsingular negatons are just the usual solitons .",
    "the interaction solutions among positons and negatons have also been studied recently@xcite . unfortunately , except for a special c - integrable model , the sto ( sharma - tass - olver ) model @xcite , in our knowledge , there is no known nonsingular positon - negaton interaction solution . though the complexiton is proposed for several years , but up to now , one has not yet found a nonsingular complexiton solution for any ( 1 + 1)-dimensional integrable systems . in high dimensions , ( 2 + 1)- and ( 3 + 1)-dimensions ,",
    "some special types of analytic nonsingular positon , posilton - negaton interaction solutions and the complexiton solutions can be easily obtained because of the existence of the arbitrary functions in their expressions of exact solutions@xcite . _",
    "then an important and interesting question is naturally arised : + _ are there any nonsingular complexiton and positon - negaton solutions for s - integrable models ? as we all know , the korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) equation is a typical and classical model to describe the weakly shallow long waves in the soliton theory .",
    "many important properties of kdv equation , such as infinitely many symmetries , infinitely many conservation laws @xcite , inverse scattering transform , bcklund transformation , darboux transformation , etc . have been studied extensively for a long time and it can be viewed as a completely integrable hamiltonian system @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is known that both the positon and complexiton solutions of the kdv equation are singuler@xcite . _    on the other hand , coupled integrable systems , which come up in many physical fields , have also been studied extensively and a lot of interesting results are given out from both the classification view and application field @xcite .",
    "the first coupled kdv system was put forward by hirota and satsuma ( hs ) in 1981 @xcite .",
    "the multi - soliton solutions , conservation laws and darboux transformation , etc for the hs model are studied in detail @xcite .",
    "many other coupled kdv systems such as the ito s system @xcite , the drinfeld and sokolov @xcite model , the fuchssteiner equation @xcite , the nutk - oguz model@xcite , the zharkov system @xcite and the foursov model @xcite are also constructed .",
    "vladimir gives a classification of the integrable coupled kdv systems by using a symmetry approach @xcite .    in the real application aspect of the coupled kdv systems , a quite general coupled kdv equation , @xmath0=0\\label{ckdv1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are arbitrary constants ,",
    "is derived from a two - wave modes in a shallow stratified liquid @xcite .",
    "another type of general coupled kdv system @xmath3 with arbitrary constants @xmath4 is obtained from a two layer model of the atmospheric dynamical system @xcite .",
    "a more general coupled kdv system @xmath5 is derived to describe two - component bose - einstein condensates @xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we study the exact solutions , especially the positons , negatons and complexitons of a special coupled kdv system @xmath6 it is clear that the coupled kdv system is a special case for all the physical systems , and .",
    "it is also interesting that , the system can be read off simply from the real and imaginary parts of the single complex kdv equation @xmath7 where @xmath8    from the fact that can be derived from the complex kdv equation , one can reasonable believe that all the integrable properties of the real kdv equation can be preserved .",
    "actually , we have really proved its painlev property though we havent write down the proof procedure here because the method is standard and even can be performed simply by pressing the  enter \" key with help of some existent maple or mathematica programmes related to the painlev test , say ,  ptest \" by xu and li @xcite .",
    "in the remained part of this paper , we use the darboux transformation which is one of the most powerful tools in constructing exact solutions for many integrable nonlinear equations to the coupled kdv system to study its positon , negaton , complexiton solutions and the interaction property among these types of excitations .",
    "in this section , we apply the darboux transformation to the coupled kdv system in order to construct exact solutions . because the coupled kdv system is obtained by imposing complex variables on the kdv equation , we can easily obtain the darboux transformation for the coupled kdv system from those of the kdv equation .",
    "it is known that the lax pair for the kdv equation reads @xmath9 @xmath10 substituting @xmath11 into eqs . and , the lax pair for eq . is as follows : @xmath12 and @xmath13 then it is easy to prove that the compatibility conditions of four equations  are exactly the equation system .    with the help of the darboux transformation for the kdv equation ,",

    "we need two wave function seed solutions @xmath20 and @xmath21 with two different spectral parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively , then the second step darboux transformation is @xmath24=u-\\left[\\ln(f^2+g^2)\\right]_{xx},\\ ] ] @xmath25=v-2\\left[\\arctan\\left(\\frac g f\\right)\\right]_{xx},\\ ] ] where two functions @xmath26 and @xmath27 are given by @xmath28 and @xmath29 respectively with @xmath30 is the usual wronskian determinant .",

    "in this section , we systematically study the positon , negaton and complexiton solutions for the coupled kdv system by means of the darboux transformations given in the last section .      based on the first step darboux transformation , analytical positon solutions for the coupled kdv system can be constructed directly .",
    "taking the seed solution as @xmath54 , then solving the lax pair - directly , one can find @xmath55 @xmath56 substituting the result equations and into the first step darboux transformation yields the single general positon solution for the coupled kdv system :    @xmath57}{(c_1 ^ 2\\cos^2\\xi_1+c_3 ^ 2\\cos^2\\xi_2)^2},\\\\ v&=&\\frac{4c_1c_3\\lambda\\left[(c_1 ^",

    "in this letter , exact solutions of a coupled kdv system which is obtained as a special case of the general coupled kdv systems derived from the two layer fluid dynamical systems and two - component bose - einstein condensates are studied in detail .",
    "the model can also be simply read off from the well known single kdv equation by assuming its field is complex .",
    "thanks to the model can be obtained from the complex kdv equation , the lax pair of the coupled kdv system follows immediately and so does the darboux transformation .    to study the detailed structures of the localized and periodic excitations of the model , the first four step darboux transformations are explicitly given in terms of the real wronskian determinant forms while the general n - step darboux transformation is written down with help of the complex wronskian determinant form .",
    "starting from the trivial seed solution , the first step of the darboux transformation leads to two types of exact solutions , the negaton and the positon which are related to negative and positive spectral parameters respectively .",
    "though the single negaton solution for other integrable models , say , the single real kdv system , can be both singular and nonsingular , it can be only analytic for the coupled kdv system .",
    "similarly , the positon solution can also be only analytic while for the single real kdv equation there is no analytic positon .",
    "the solutions obtained from the second step darboux transformation and the trivial zero seed can be two negaton interaction solution , two positon solution , negaton - positon solution and a single complexiton dependent on the selections of the spectral parameters . the interaction among negatons is completely elastic . the positon - negaton solution can be considered as a single soliton solution with a periodic wave background .",

    "this type of nonsingular complexiton solution may exist for other types of coupled integrable systems .    though the coupled kdv system studied here can be read off from the complex kdv equation , the solution properties are quite different .",
    "for the real single component kdv equation , there is no nonsingular positons and complexitons .",
    "however , for the coupled kdv system , negatons , positons and complexitons can be nonsingular .    for the single kdv system ,",
    "various other types of exact solutions , such as the rational solutions , cnoidal wave solutions , algebraic geometry solutions and @xmath104 function solutions have been obtained by many authors under different approaches .",
    "the similar solutions for the coupled kdv system can be easily obtained in some similar ways .",
    "however , the detailed properties of the solutions , especially there analytic behavior , must be quite different .",
