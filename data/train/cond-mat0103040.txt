    "magnesium diboride ( @xmath1 ) is an intermetallic compound whose superconductivity with @xmath2 @xmath6 39 k was recently discovered.@xcite the observation of a significant boron isotope effect@xcite strongly suggests that the system is a phonon - mediated bcs superconductor thus making this intermetallic compound very interesting for its remarkably high @xmath2 among conventional bcs superconductors .",
    "@xmath1 crystallizes in the hexagonal @xmath7 type structure , which consists of alternating hexagonal layers of @xmath8 atoms and graphite - like honeycomb layers of @xmath9 atoms .",
    "powder samples of isotopically enriched @xmath10 were prepared with the method described in ref . [ 2 ] .",
    "x - ray powder diffraction measurements confirmed the hexagonal unit cell of @xmath1.@xcite magnetization measurements done at @xmath11 = 25 oe yield a transition temperature @xmath2 = 39.2 k with a shielding volume fraction close to 100%.@xcite we have investigated two different samples from different batches of polycrystalline enriched @xmath10 in order to check the reproducibility of the data .",
    "the two samples are referred to as sample 1 and sample 2 .",
    "both samples are in powder form with sample 1 having been ground to a smaller grain size .",
    "no substantial differences were observed in the nmr measurements on the two samples .",
    "the onset of superconductivity in sample 2 was determined by monitoring the detuning of the nmr circuit occurring at @xmath12 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . this type of measurement corresponds to probing the temperature dependence of the radio frequency surface resistance .",
    "thus , as the magnetic field is increased the transition region broadens due to the dissipation associated to flux lines motion below @xmath2 and at 7.2 tesla no detuning can be observed although the magnetization measurements indicate a @xmath2 = 23 k at 7 tesla . the temperature at which the detuning is first observed is plotted in the inset of fig . 1 for the different magnetic fields and compared to the @xmath12 values obtained in ref .",
    "[ 4 ] from magnetization measurements . from the good agreement between the two sets of data",
    "one can deduce that the onset of detuning in the nmr circuit occurs at the irreversibility line .",
    "@xmath0 nmr and relaxation measurements were performed with a pulse fourier transform spectrometer in an external magnetic field of 7.2 t and 1.4 t. fig .",
    "2 shows the @xmath0 spectrum obtained from the fourier transform of half of the solid echo following a @xmath13-@xmath14 pulse sequence . in order to cover the whole spectrum",
    "three separate spectra were recorded at resonance frequencies centered at the three lines and added together .",
    "the spectrum shows the typical powder pattern for a nuclear spin @xmath15 = 3/2 in presence of first order quadrupole effects with an axially symmetric field gradient.@xcite the separation of the symmetric satellite lines is given by @xmath16 whereby for the powder singularities @xmath17 = 90@xmath18 thus yielding @xmath19 khz .",
    "the axially symmetric field gradient is consistent with the local hexagonal symmetry at the boron site .",
    "the quadrupole coupling constant is practically independent of temperature ( see inset in fig .",
    "2 ) ruling out any structural distortion of the lattice in the temperature range investigated .",
    "the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the central line of the @xmath0 spectrum is about 16 khz in the 7.2 t magnetic field and is temperature independent in the 4.2 - 300 k range .",
    "the second order quadrupole broadening of the central line at this high field can be estimated to be of the order of @xmath20 = 3.5 khz and can thus be neglected . at 1.4 tesla",
    "the contribution due to quadrupole broadening is 18 khz .",
    "this is consistent with the observed @xmath0 nmr spectrum which dispalys an asymmetric central line as expected for a powder broadening due to second order quadrupole effects .",
    "the @xmath0 nmr shift of the central line was measured with respect to the resonance frequency in @xmath21 aqueous solution at 7.2 t. since the central line does not show at high field any detectable asymmetry the anisotropic shift must be negligible and the measured shift can be entirely ascribed to an isotropic knight shift ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath22 is shown in fig .",
    "the large error bars are due to the small size of the shift with respect to the width of the line .",
    "@xmath0 nuclear spin lattice relaxation rates ( nslr ) were measured by saturating the central line only with a single @xmath23 pulse and monitoring the growth of the solid echo at variable delays.@xcite the nslr defined as @xmath24 was extracted from the fit of the data to the recovery law : @xmath25 which is obtained from the solution of the master equations in case of a magnetic relaxation mechanism.@xcite the temperature dependence of the nslr is shown in fig .",
    "4 . as can be seen a linear temperature dependence",
    "is observed in the normal phase that is independent of the applied magnetic field .",
    "below @xmath2 the nslr is very different for the two field values i.e. 7.2 t and 1.4 t.",
    "the knight shift at the @xmath0 site is dominated by the contact hyperfine interaction due to @xmath5-type electrons with negligible contributions from core polarization , exchange interactions and orbital terms.@xcite thus , the very small value of @xmath22 at room temperature ( see fig .",
    "3 ) indicates a very small @xmath5-character of the wave function of the conduction electrons at the fermi surface in @xmath1 . for comparison , in @xmath26 intermetallic",
    "compound , where the isotropic knight shift is almost one order of magnitude bigger than in @xmath1,@xcite the ratio between the @xmath5-type density of states at the fermi level with respect to the total density of state was estimated to be @xmath27 = 0.013 .",
    "thus for @xmath1 one expects an even smaller ratio .",
    "although the absolute value of such a small shift depends critically on the reference compound chosen we can conclude that the @xmath5-type wave function at the fermi level is negligible in @xmath1 .",
    "this conclusion is not inconsistent with the results of band structure calculations.@xcite    in the normal state the nslr follows a linear temperature dependence down to @xmath2 with @xmath4 = 165 @xmath3 10 sec k ( see fig .",
    "the korringa ratio@xcite at room temperature is @xmath28 0.2 , much lower than the ideal value of unity for @xmath5-electrons and is temperature dependent ( @xmath29 = 2.57 10@xmath30 for @xmath0 with @xmath31 , @xmath32 the gyromagnetic ratios for the electron and nucleus respectively ) .",
    "this indicates that the nslr is driven by a mechanism different from scattering with @xmath5-type conduction electrons at the fermi level .",
    "one possible explanation is that the nslr is dominated by orbital contribution due to @xmath33-electrons .",
    "this contribution is expected to be proportional to the density of p - states at the fermi level and to temperature but does not obey the korringa ratio.@xcite      in conventional bcs @xmath5-wave superconductors one expects a coherence peak below @xmath2 in the nslr and an exponential decrease at low @xmath34 of both the knight shift and @xmath4 due to the opening of the superconducting gap.@xcite since the knight shift is small compared to the line width in a powder sample no quantitative information can be obtained here from the decrease of @xmath22 below @xmath2 ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . regarding the nslr",
    "the measurements in an external magnetic field are difficult to interpret because of the presence of a contribution to relaxation due to the flux lines.@xcite also , the size of the coherence peak can be drastically reduced by an external magnetic field , through a pair - breaking mechanism.@xcite    at 7.2 tesla the temperature dependence of @xmath35 in fig .",
    "4 does not show any coherence peak nor exponential drop but rather a slight enhancement with respect to the normal state which persists down to 4.2 k. at such a high field it is likely that the nslr below @xmath2 is largely dominated by the relaxation of nuclei inside the vortex core .",
    "in fact , from the measurement of the upper critical field @xmath36 = 16.5 t@xcite one can estimate a vortex size @xmath37 = 60 @xmath38 which can be compared with the intervortex spacing at 7.2 t for a triangular vortex lattice i.e. @xmath39 = 200 @xmath38 .",
    "in presence of spin diffusion process ( short @xmath40 and long @xmath41 ) the measured nslr is a weighted average of the relaxation in the vortex core where the metal is in the normal state and in the intervortex region whereby the short relaxation in the vortex core dominates the measured nslr.@xcite as a matter of fact the slight increase of the nslr observed below @xmath2 at 7.2 t is similar to the effect due to thermal motion of flux lines previuosly observed in htsc.@xcite    at 1.4 tesla the @xmath42 nslr ( see fig .",
    "4 ) in the normal state is the same as at 7.2 t as expected for a relaxation mechanism due to scattering with the conduction electrons . below the superconducting transition temperature",
    "the signal becomes very weak due to the small penetration of the radio frequency .",
    "the few measurements we could perform indicate that there is no measurable coherence peak just below @xmath2 and that the nslr at low temperatures is much longer than at 7.2 t confirming that the dominant contribution to relaxation in an external magnetic field is associated with the density of flux lines and their thermal fluctuations.@xcite    in conclusion , we compare our results with the nslr data reported by kotegawa et al.@xcite above @xmath2 both sets of data are in good agreement .",
    "below @xmath2 our data at 7.2 t and at 1.4 t are quite different from kotegawa s data taken at 4.42 t confirming the strong field dependence of @xmath43 in the superconducting phase that we ascribe to the contribution of fluxons . as a consequence ,",
    "any conclusion regarding the coherence peak and the superconducting gap obtained from data taken in an external magnetic field appears dubious .",
    "one should either perform the measurements in zero field by a field cycling technique@xcite or one should do a careful study of the field dependence in order to subtract off first the contribution due to flux lines .",
    "these studies , which require a long time to perform due to the weakness of the @xmath0 signal and the very long nslr at low fields , are currently planned .",
    "finally we compare our results with the results reported by gerashenko et al.@xcite the conclusions about the @xmath0 quadrupole perturbed nmr spectrum are in excellent agreement with our data .",
    "the differences in the knight shift values should be ascribed to the use of a difference reference sample .",
    "the data of nslr below @xmath2 were taken by gerashenko et al . in a magnetic field of 2.113 t and",
    "are in qualitative agreement with our data at 1.4 t particularly regarding the absence of a coherence peak .",
