    "light front field theories ( lfft s ) have emerged as a strong candidate amongst theoretical formalisms that can provide an answer to the yet unresolved problem of a relativistic bound state system . if the present attempts to apply the methods developed in this area of research are successful , one will be able to obtain , starting form basic principles , the wave functions of hadrons which are important input in the calculation of hadronic cross sections @xcite .",
    "an important issue that needs to be understood for the success of these efforts is the problem of infrared ( ir ) divergences which have different structure from those in equal time theory . in this work",
    ", we address the important issue of ir cancellation in light front quantum electrodynamics ( lfqed ) .",
    "it is well known that the infrared divergences in equal  time formulation of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) are eliminated to all orders due to a cancellation between the real and virtual contributions by virtue of the famous bloch and nordseick theorem@xcite .",
    "the theorem is based on the idea that in an actual experiment involving charged particles , one can not specify the final state completely as due to the finite size of the detector , the charged particle can be accompanied by any number of soft photons .",
    "therefore , in cross section calculations , one must sum over all possible final states taking into account emission of soft real photons which might have escaped detection .",
    "the bloch - nordseick mechanism takes into account all states with any number of soft photons below experimental resolution thus leading to cancellation of ir divergences .    in qed ,",
    "a general approach to treat ir divergences was given by yennie _",
    "etal _  @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "ir divergences are factored out and then treated to all orders of covariant perturbation theory to give a residual perturbative expansion which is ir finite .",
    "these ir factors are then expressed in exponential form leading to cancellation of ir divergences between the real and virtual photon contributions .",
    "these factors depend only on the external momenta of charged particles and are independent of the momentum of the intermediate interaction terms .    following the work of yennie _ etal _",
    ", chung @xcite showed that ir divergences indeed cancel to all orders in perturbation theory at the level of amplitude itself provided the initial and final states are chosen properly .",
    "the condition for this cancellation constrains the initial and final states , which are actually charged particles with a superposition of an infinitely large number of soft photons , to belong to a new space instead of the usual fock space .",
    "kulish and faddeev ( kf)@xcite developed the method of asymptotic dynamics and obtained a set of asymptotic states starting with a modified , relativistically and gauge invariant definition of s  matrix and showed the cancellation of ir divergences at amplitude level using this basis .",
    "kf were the first to show that in qed , the asymptotic hamiltonian does not coincide with the free hamiltonian .",
    "they constructed the asymptotic hamiltonian @xmath0 for qed thus modifying the asymptotic condition to introduce a new space of asymptotic states given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 defined by @xmath3\\ ] ] is the asymptotic evolution operator and @xmath4 is the fock state .",
    "the transition matrix elements formed by using these states are ir finite .",
    "kf approach was applied by greco etal@xcite to study the ir behavior of non abelian gauge theories using coherent states of definite color and factorized in fixed angle regime .",
    "the matrix elements using these coherent states were shown to be ir finite , first to the lowest order and then to all orders under the condition that the soft meson formula for real gluons holds to all orders .",
    "coherent states in the context of light front field theory ( lfft ) have been discussed by various authors@xcite .",
    "a coherent state approach has been developed by one of us and applied to show the cancellation of true ir divergences in one loop vertex correction in lfqed in ref .",
    "subsequently , the formalism was applied to show the same in lfqcd @xcite .",
    "possibility of practical application of the method was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite where the coherent state method was applied to obtain an ir divergence free light - cone schrdinger equation for positronium .",
    "it has also been shown that the ir divergences in fermion self energy correction at two loop order cancel in lfqed @xcite if one uses coherent state approach . in this work ,",
    "we demonstrate the cancellation of ir divergences in fermion mass renormalization in light front quantum electrodynamics ( lfqed ) to all orders by using a coherent state basis ( csb ) for calculating the hamiltonian matrix elements .",
    "but till date no such proof exists in lfqcd due to the confinement property of qcd .",
    "in the following sections , we shall present a most general and a rather formal all order proof of cancellation of ir divergences in fermion mass renormalization in lfqed by using a csb for calculating the hamiltonian matrix elements .",
    "the coherent state method is based on the observation that for theories with long range interactions or theories having bound states as asymptotic states , the total hamiltonian does not reduce to the free field hamiltonian in the limit @xmath5 . in lfft , the asymptotic hamiltonian @xmath6 ,",
    "is evaluated by taking the limit @xmath7 of the interaction hamiltonian .",
    "each term in the interaction hamiltonian @xmath8 has a light - cone time dependence of the form @xmath9 $ ] and therefore , if @xmath10 vanishes at some vertex , then the corresponding term in @xmath8 does not vanish in large @xmath11 limit .",
    "thus , the total hamiltonian can be written as @xmath12 where @xmath13 the associated @xmath11 evolution operator @xmath14 in the schrdinger representation , which satisfies the equation @xmath15 can then be used to generate an asymptotic space @xmath16{\\cal h}_f\\ ] ] from the usual fock space @xmath17 , in the limit @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the asymptotic evolution operator defined by @xmath20 exp[\\omega^a(x^+)]\\ ] ] the asymptotic evolution operator is then used to define the coherent states @xmath21 \\vert n \\rangle\\ ] ] the method of asymptotic dynamics , proposed originally by kulish and faddeev  @xcite in the context of equal time qed consists of identifying the terms in the interaction hamiltonian which do not vanish at infinitely large times and then using them to construct the asymptotic mller operator and hence the coherent states . in lfft s",
    ", the true ir divergences corresponding to @xmath22 are not expected to appear when one uses this csb to calculate the transition matrix elements . in the following sections",
    ", we will prove this statement to all orders for fermion mass renormalization in lfqed .",
    "interaction hamiltonian of lfqed in light front gauge is given by @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24\\ ] ] @xmath25 and @xmath26 are three point qed interaction vertex and the light front energy transferred at the vertex @xmath27 respectively .",
    "@xmath28 and @xmath29 are the non - local 4point instantaneous vertices . here , we will focus on construction of asymptotic hamiltonian using 3point vertex .",
    "the same procedure can be used to construct the asymptotic hamiltonian terms corresponding to the 4point interaction vertices also .",
    "the details of the calculation of the four point asymptotic interaction can be found in ref .",
    "one can notice , from the time dependence of @xmath30 that it does not become zero at large ( light - cone ) times whenever @xmath31 .",
    "for example , the three point interaction hamiltonian has a term with light - cone time dependence of the form @xmath32 $ ] and therefore , if @xmath33 then this term does not vanish at infinite times .",

    "it can be shown that this condition is satisfied in the region defined by @xmath37 we call this region the asymptotic region .",

    "we hope that the coherent state formalism may provide a hint towards constructing an artificial potential for qcd which can be used to perform bound state calculations@xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that the asymptotic states in strong interactions are bound states and not just the coherent states as in qed .",
    "one way to obtain the `` artificial '' confining potential required for light front bound state calculations @xcite would be to impose the criteria of ir cancellation to find an appropriate potential @xcite .",
