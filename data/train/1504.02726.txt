    "because neptune s atmosphere has a relatively low burden of aerosols , its reflected spectrum is strongly influenced by both rayleigh scattering and raman scattering by molecular hydrogen .",
    "rayleigh scattering induces polarization that can significantly modify the reflected intensity ( mishchenko 1994 ) , accurate computation of which presents the very large burden of solving the vector radiation transfer equation .",
    "sromovsky ( 2004 ) discusses that problem and a new approximation method applicable to low phase angles .",
    "accurate treatment of raman scattering is also a computational burden because photons incident at one wavelength lose some energy to rotating and/or vibrating the hydrogen molecule and reappear at longer wavelengths .",
    "computation of reflectivity at one wavelength thus requires accounting for contributions from raman scattering at shorter wavelengths .",
    "in addition , because the raman source function varies continuously with optical depth , otherwise homogeneous layers become inhomogeneous , requiring many more layers to achieve an accurate characterization of the atmosphere .    to avoid the computational burden of rigorous raman scattering calculations ,",
    "several different approximations have been employed .",
    "baines and smith ( 1994 ) used an approximation suggested by wallace ( 1972 ) , in which the raman cross sections for rotational transitions are treated as conservative scattering because the wavelength shifts are relatively small , while the cross section for the vibrational transition , which involves a much larger wavelength shift , is treated as an absorption .",
    "this approximation does not produce the sharp spectral features characteristic of raman scattering and is of uncertain accuracy .",
    "pollack ( 1986 ) used an alternate approximation in which the rayleigh scattering cross section at a given wavelength is scaled by the solar irradiance ratio at the shifted and unshifted wavelengths .",
    "this approximation does produce raman spectral features , but the accuracy is not well known , and can create conservation problems by allowing single - scattering albedo values exceeding unity .",
    "karkoschka ( 1994 ) presented a method for correcting observations to remove raman scattering and for converting calculations that ignored raman scattering to spectra that approximately matched spectra that included raman scattering .",
    "that method can add or remove raman spectral features and was applied to observations of saturn , jupiter , uranus , and neptune , but was never tested for accuracy or generality .",
    "a number of calculations of neptune s geometric albedo have been made that do account for the basic physics of raman scattering .",
    "cochran and trafton ( 1978 ) implemented an iterative algorithm in which raman scattering is first treated as an absorption . after solving the scalar radiation transfer equation at each frequency grid point ,",
    "the photon loss is computed from the radiation field . on the next iteration",
    "the lost photons are added back as source terms at the shifted wavelengths appropriate to each raman transition .",
    "they achieved convergence after three iterations .",
    "their mainly low resolution results are of limited utility however , because the atmospheric structure they assumed is so different from our current understanding .",
    "their claim that the residual intensity in the cores of the strong methane bands could be entirely explained by raman scattering will be shown to be invalid because of their assumed ch@xmath4 mixing ratio profile .",
    "the first model calculations displaying extensively detailed raman spectral features in neptune s atmosphere are those of courtin ( 1999 ) , who made use of the two - stream code of toon ( 1989 ) to speed the solution of the radiative transfer equation . but this method can deviate from exact solutions by 10 - 15% , does not account for polarization , and is not usable for studying center - to - limb variations .",
    "a more rigorous method was used by btremieux and yelle ( 1999 ) , based on the disort radiative transfer code ( stamnes 1988 ) .",
    "but they presented only results for jupiter and omitted polarization effects .",
    "this paper presents a new method for accurate computation of raman scattering that includes polarization in the context of neptune s atmosphere and makes preliminary applications of that method to resolve several significant issues .",
    "the next section reviews the basic physics of raman scattering .",
    "that is followed by a discussion of methods for accurate computation of raman scattering .",
    "sample computations are then presented to characterize the basic features of raman scattering on neptune .",
    "comparisons are made with various prior calculations , and with hst and groundbased observations , to assess the degree of haze absorption required in neptune s atmosphere .",
    "the final section evaluates past approximations , discusses how they can be generalized and improved , and presents the new approximation and its performance .",
    "the hydrogen molecule can exist in two nuclear spin states .",
    "ortho states have parallel nuclear spins and odd total angular momentum quantum numbers ( @xmath5 ... ) with a degeneracy of @xmath6 .",
    "the para states have antiparallel nuclear spins and even angular momentum quantum numbers ( @xmath7 .. ) with a degeneracy of @xmath8 .",
    "the equilibrium population of these states follows the boltzmann distribution , so that the fraction of molecules with angular momentum @xmath9 is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the degeneracy , @xmath12 is the energy above the ground state , @xmath13 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath14 is absolute temperature . using published expressions for the energy levels ( farkas 1935 ; massie and hunten 1982 ) we obtain the fractional populations given in table 1 , where @xmath15 is the total fraction of molecules with even @xmath9 and @xmath16 is the total fraction of molecules with odd @xmath9 .",
    "this assumes that ortho and para states can exchange energy .",
    "however , the time scale for equilibration by means of bimolecular collisions is of the order of years ( massie and hunten 1982 ) and radiative energy exchange is forbidden by selection rules .",
    "thus it is also meaningful to consider a different kind of equilibrium condition in which ortho states equilibrate separately from para states .",
    "this is relevant when hydrogen equilibrates at high temperature , then is lifted by convection to higher altitude where the fraction of para and ortho molecules remain fixed ( over short time scales ) but equilibration of energy levels within each sub - population does take place . for `` normal '' h@xmath0 , which is defined by the high temperature equilibrium value of @xmath17 ,",
    "the sub - population distributions are given by @xmath18 where the partition functions @xmath19 and @xmath20 are summations of @xmath21 carried out over even @xmath9 and odd @xmath9 respectively .",

    "it was necessary to use 72 logarithmically spaced gas layers to avoid cumulative photon fluxes exceeding unity . when cross sections were made wavelength independent , but evaluated at 0.4 @xmath2 m , the accuracy for a given number of levels was much higher .",
    "monochromatic calculations were run with three different choices for the number of logarithmically spaced atmospheric levels between 0.0003 and 100 bars : 18 , 36 , and 72 . the ratios to the 72-level fluxes , were 0.991 - 0.998 for the 18-level result , and 0.998 - 0.9996 for the 36-level result .",

    "for an irradiance spectrum with a @xmath195-independent photon flux , one might expect the apparent geometric albedo with raman scattering to be the same as without it .",

    "this argument works well if atmospheric properties are also independent of wavelength .",

    "the results shown in fig.[fig : flatphotabs ] are roughly consistent with this argument .",

    "the 0.23 - 0.405 @xmath2 m spectral range yielded a smoother inverted spectrum but a larger offset albedo of 0.03 .",
    "much worse results were obtained with the clear sky model , which has larger raman features that are not as well fit by karkoschka s empirical model .",
    "as expected , we found that the features due to weak ch@xmath4 bands were much smaller in the transformed spectra than in the true physical spectra .",
    "thus , estimates of ch@xmath4 absorption coefficients using spectra corrected in this way will be significantly below the true absorption level .",
    "karkoschka s method has several physical flaws that limit its applicability .",
    "multiple scattering is one effect that is not accounted for but can be significant ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : monoscat ] ) .",
    "another problem with the physics assumed in eq .",
    "[ eq : karkcorr ] is that the contribution at the present wavenumber is not necessarily proportional to the geometric albedo at the upward shifted wavenumber .",
    "in fact , the proportionality constant also depends on the vertical distribution of the scattered photons in relation to the vertical distribution of opacity at the scattered wavelength .",
    "the karkoschka forward method also is not generally applicable to spatially resolved observations because the amplitude of raman effects depends on view angle as well as local aerosol structure .",
    "the useful spectral range for the karkoschka correction is also rather limited , probably to wavelengths less than about 0.405 @xmath2 m , partly because it does not properly modify weak ch@xmath4 absorption bands .",
    "the approximation suggested by wallace ( 1972 ) is a modification of the molecular single scattering albedo of the atmosphere by treating rotational transitions as extra sources of scattering and the vibrational transition as a pure absorption .",
    "this can be expressed in terms of cross sections as follows : @xmath249 where @xmath250 is the rayleigh scattering cross section , @xmath251 is the total cross section for absorption by ch@xmath4 and cia by h@xmath0 , @xmath252 is the combined cross section for rotational raman transitions , @xmath253 is the cross section for vibrational raman transitions , and where @xmath254 for the original wallace approximation . for a clear neptune atmosphere , we find that the original wallace approximation provides a crude match to the low resolution baseline of the spectrum , but is generally 5% to 10% low and of course does not produce characteristic raman spectral features .",
    "a few detailed calculations by wallace ( 1972 ) at 0.2 @xmath2 m and 0.4 @xmath2 m also indicated that his approximation was about 5% low .",
    "the wallace approximation error is nearly zero in the near - ir ch@xmath4 windows , but is about 4% low in the ch@xmath4 absorption bands , which is about what would be expected if raman scattering were ignored ( see lower part of fig.[fig : approx3in1 ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : approx3in1 ] displays a modified form of the wallace approximation that boosts the i / f value by setting @xmath255 , which treats the vibrational cross section as 56.7% absorption and 43.3% scattering .",

    "lower : ratios of the approximate geometric albedo spectra to the accurate raman calculation.,width=355 ]      pollack ( 1986 ) approximated raman scattering contributions from shorter wavelengths by scaling the raman scattering cross section at the reflected wavelength by the ratio of solar irradiance at the source wavelength to that at the reflected wavelength .",
    "generalizing this approach to include more than one transition , the molecular single - scattering albedo in this approximation can be written as : @xmath256 where @xmath257 , @xmath258 is a function of @xmath259 that can be empirically adjusted to compensate for some of the complexities that are glossed over by this concept , and the upper bound of 1 is used to avoid energy conservation problems . setting @xmath260 , and omitting the rotational transitions completely , would reduce this to pollack s original suggestion , while setting @xmath261 and @xmath262 would reduce this to the wallace approximation .",
    "a problem with pollack s original formulation was that it resulted in @xmath263 at some wavelengths , as noted by courtin ( 1999 ) , which leads to instability in the solution of the radiation transfer equation .",
    "another problem is that it considered only the @xmath264 vibrational transition , which alone would be unable to generate the ghost features arising from the rotational transitions .",

    "[ eq : pollack ] has the capability to fit all the main ghost features and has the potential , with tuning of the form of @xmath259 , to yield the correct baseline value as well .",
    "it also has an advantage over karkoschka s correction , in that it is introduced at a more fundamental physical level that is naturally modified by the presence of aerosols .",
    "however , wherever the geometric albedo exceeds the value for a conservative rayleigh atmosphere of 0.7908 ( sromovsky 2004 ) , even @xmath265 will not be able to reproduce the albedo value",
    ". this problem can be reduced by working at lower spectral resolutions for which these extreme peak amplitudes become reduced below 0.7908 .",
    "preliminary calculations with this approximation used the three transitions given in table  4 , with @xmath266 and @xmath267 the same for all transitions . we found that making the constant @xmath267 = 0.875 for all @xmath98 produced a reasonably good match to the baseline level of geometric albedo , but generated spectral modulations that were too large . to limit these modulations , we used an exponential function to limit the effect of the spectral irradiance ratio , i.e. we used @xmath268 , which is @xmath269 for small @xmath259 and approaches @xmath270 for large values of @xmath259 .",
    "we found that @xmath271 provided a reasonable fit to the raman spectral features and to the baseline level , as shown in fig.[fig : approx3in1 ] . while this is certainly an improvement over the wallace approximation , and does reproduce many of the spectral features associated with raman scattering , it does not do so consistently and accurately enough to use for interpreting those features . like the wallace approximation",
    ", it also fails to improve geometric albedo accuracy for @xmath219 0.47 @xmath2 m .",
    "both wallace and pollack modifications to the single - scattering albedo seem to be far less effective in regions where ch@xmath4 absorption is important . since the actual source function depends on the light level in the atmosphere , which may have a spectral shape that is very different from the incident solar spectrum , it is not appropriate to use the solar spectral ratio as a scale factor in spectral regions with strong ch@xmath4 absorption .",
    "the following method goes part of the way in solving this problem .",
    "the following describes a new approximation of raman scattering that uses a different kind of modification of the molecular single scattering albedo . instead of using a constant factor or the solar spectral ratio to modify the molecular single - scattering albedo ,",
    "this approximation uses a @xmath195-dependent multiplier that is tuned to minimize the difference between simulated and exact raman calculations of geometric albedo for an appropriate model atmosphere .",
    "the fundamental relation used is from sromovsky ( 2004 ) : @xmath272 , \\label{eq : pofomega}\\ ] ] where @xmath273 is the geometric albedo including polarization contributions and @xmath247 is the single scattering albedo of a semi - infinite rayleigh atmosphere .",
    "this equation is inverted numerically to provide a function @xmath274 so that a given geometric albedo can be related to an equivalent single - scattering albedo of a semi - infinite rayleigh atmosphere .",
    "starting with a raman - free calculation producing a spectrum @xmath275 , and a true raman calculation producing a spectrum @xmath276 , we use the inverse transform to compute equivalent single - scattering albedos @xmath277 and @xmath278 . noting that @xmath279",
    ", we then attribute the difference between the equivalent inverse single scattering albedos as due to a difference in the effective absorption due to raman scattering .",

    "because all of these approximations that modify single - scattering albedos really lack the essential physics of the raman scattering process , it is doubtful whether they can have much utility in situations for which they have not been tuned .",

    "<S> raman scattering by h@xmath0 in neptune s atmosphere has significant effects on its reflectivity for @xmath1 0.5 @xmath2 m , producing baseline decreases of @xmath3 20% in a clear atmosphere and @xmath3 10% in a hazy atmosphere . </S>",
    "<S> however , few accurate raman calculations are carried out because of their complexity and computational costs . here </S>",
    "<S> we present the first radiation transfer algorithm that includes both polarization and raman scattering and facilitates computation of spatially resolved spectra . </S>",

    "<S> j. * 219 * _ , 756 - 762 ) suggestion that light reflected in the deep ch@xmath4 bands is mainly raman scattered is not valid for current estimates of the ch@xmath4vertical distribution , which implies only a 4% raman contribution . </S>",
    "<S> comparisons with iue , hst , and groundbased observations confirm that high altitude haze absorption is reducing neptune s geometric albedo by @xmath36% in the 0.22 - 0.26 @xmath2 m range and by @xmath313% in the 0.35 - 0.45 @xmath2 m range . </S>",

    "<S> the karkoschka ( 1994 , _ icarus * 111 * _ , 174 - 192 ) method of applying raman corrections to calculated spectra and removing raman effects from observed spectra is shown to have limited applicability and to undercorrect the depths of weak ch@xmath4 absorption bands . the relatively large q - branch contribution observed by karkoschka is shown to be consistent with current estimates of raman cross sections . the wallace ( 1972 , _ astrophys . </S>",
    "<S> j. * 176 * _ , 249 - 257 ) approximation , produces geometric albedo values @xmath35% low as originally proposed , but can be made much more accurate by including a scattering contribution from the vibrational transition . the original pollack ( 1986 , _ icarus </S>",
    "<S> * 65 * _ , 442 - 466 ) approximation is inaccurate and unstable , but can be greatly improved by several simple modifications . </S>",
    "<S> a new approximation based on spectral tuning of the effective molecular single scattering albedo provides low errors for zenith angles below 70 in a clear atmosphere , although intermediate clouds present problems at longer wavelengths . </S>"
