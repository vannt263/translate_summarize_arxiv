    "the latter serves to illustrate a dilemma commonly facing the interpretation of co maps , especially those of highly inclined galaxies where rings are most easily discerned : the conspicuous molecular structure may in fact consist of spiral arm segments that only in projection suggest a ringlike structure .",

    "( 1993 ) and von linden et al .",
    "this is quite different from most other galaxies observed in co , where the two transitions are usually of similar strength .",

    "this model is characterized by cold molecular gas ( typical temperature @xmath87 = 10 k ) present at both high and low volume densities ( typically of order a few hundred and a few thousand per cc respectively ) , in addition to a warmer component ( temperature @xmath93 ) of high density .",
    "this is probably a simplification : in reality a range of densities and temperatures is likely to be present . as the large linear beamsize ( 1.5 kpc along the major axis , 5.5 kpc along the minor axis ) only provides results averaged over a large radial range , the spatial distributions of the cold and the warm gas within the beam may well be different . both kinetic temperature and mean molecular gas density in the centre of ngc  7331 are typically an order of magnitude below the values found in later - type starburst galaxies such as ngc  253 and m  82 ( israel et al . 1995 ; wall et al . 1991 ) .",

    "the evaluation of the models in tables 5 and 6 assumes a radiation field @xmath95 , corresponding to @xmath96 photons s@xmath89 @xmath90 which is consistent with the longer - wavelength uv data by wesselius et al .",
    "such a low radiation field density is also indicated by the strength of the 7.7 and 11.3 @xmath10 m dust emission features ( smith 1998 ) .",
    "the beam - averaged column densities in table 6 are relatively insensitive to changes in the assumed @xmath97 , because in the cold diffuse gas , most carbon is already in c rather than in co , whereas the much smaller filling factor of the dense gas greatly reduces the effect of changes in the @xmath64 ratio on the beam - averaged neutral carbon column density .",
    "moreover , we expect only limited variation ( by a factor of 23 ) in the radiation field density over at least the inner 5 kpc because of the smooth distribution of h@xmath94 emission as well as the far - infrared emission between 50@xmath10 m and 200@xmath10 m ( smith @xmath12 harvey 1996 ; alton et al .",
    "the quiescence of the spiral arms is illustrated by the strong excess of 450 and 850@xmath10 m emission from cold dust ( bianchi et al .",

    "<S> co emission from the sb(rs)i - ii galaxy ngc 7331 has been mapped in the @xmath0=21 transition with a 21@xmath1 beam over an area 3.5@xmath2 by 1.3@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> a relatively low contrast enhancement of molecular line emission occurs in a ringlike zone at a distance of approximately 3.5 kpc from the center ; there is no evidence for a pronounced central hole . </S>",
    "<S> the ring is located at the edge of the region of rigid rotation and roughly coincides with an inhomogeneous ring of nonthermal radio continuum emission . </S>",
    "<S> it is well inside the radius of maximum rotational velocity .    </S>",
    "<S> the intensities of the 492 ghz [ ci ] line and various @xmath3co and @xmath4co transitions observed towards the center and two outlying positions are modelled by multiple molecular gas components : low - density gas at a kinetic temperature @xmath5 k , and high - density gas at both @xmath5 k and @xmath6 k. the molecular gas must be distributed in clumpy or filamentary form . </S>",
    "<S> the co - to - h@xmath7 conversion factor @xmath8 applicable to the bulge is only half that applicable to the ring and beyond . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is still significantly lower than @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> molecular hydrogen is the dominant mass contributor to the interstellar medium in the bulge and in the ring . </S>",
    "<S> far - infrared emission from dust peaks inside the ring at 100@xmath10 m ( warm dust ) , and in the ring at 850@xmath10 m ( colder dust ) . beyond the ring , </S>",
    "<S> neutral atomic hydrogen is dominant . </S>",
    "<S> inferred total hydrogen mass densities in the ring are about twice those in the bulge . </S>",
    "<S> interstellar gas to dynamical mass ratios are of order 1@xmath11 in the bulge , about 1.5@xmath11 in the ring followed by a rise to 3@xmath11 </S>",
    "<S> . the bulge gas may have originated in mass loss from bulge stars ; in that case , the molecular ring is probably caused by a decrease in evacuation efficiency at the bulge outer edge . </S>"
