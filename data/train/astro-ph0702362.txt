    "gravitational lensing statistics are a useful tool for constraining the cosmological parameters , or alternatively , investigating the global properties of lensing galaxy populations ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . however , both applications require a complete sample of gravitational lenses , drawn from a parent population with a well defined selection function ( @xcite ) .",
    "such samples can be best obtained at radio wavelengths since dust obscuration within the lensing galaxy , which plagues optical based surveys , is not a factor and the high angular resolutions available can detect sub - arcsec image separations .",
    "radio surveys can also be complete , flux density limited and carried out efficiently , with almost uniform sensitivity and resolution .",
    "moreover , radio surveys with a flat - spectrum radio source parent population have been successful because the simple compact structure of the background source allowed the straightforward identification of galaxy - scale image splitting ( typically @xmath0  1  arcsec ) with high sensitivity instruments such as the very large array ( vla ) .",

    "a complete sample of 11 685 flat - spectrum radio sources ( the exact selection criteria for this parent population sample is given in section [ class ] ) was observed with the vla at 8.46  ghz in a configuration ( resolution of @xmath0  0.2  arcsec ) .",
    "those sources which were found to have multiple components with gaussian full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) @xmath4  170  mas , flux density ratios @xmath4  10:1 and separated by @xmath5  300  mas in the class 8.46  ghz vla images were followed - up as potential gravitational lensing candidates .",
    "further observations with optical telescopes and high resolution radio arrays confirmed the lensing hypothesis for 22 gravitational lens systems during the course of class . of these systems ,",
    "13 form a well - defined statistical sample of gravitational lenses from a parent population of 8958 flat - spectrum radio sources .",
    "this results in a class lensing rate of 1:689 .",
    "further details of the class gravitational lens systems , and the procedures used to discover them , can be found in @xcite .    a thorough analysis of the class gravitational lensing statistics found , for a flat - universe with a classical cosmological constant ( @xmath61 ) , @xmath7  0.69@xmath8 at the 68 per cent confidence level ( @xcite ) .",
    "this result , which is consistent with the findings from sn1a ( e.g. @xcite ) , large - scale structure ( e.g. @xcite ) and cosmic microwave background ( e.g. @xcite ) data , provides further independent evidence for the cosmological concordance model .",
    "furthermore , the class gravitational lensing statistics have also been used to investigate the global properties of the lensing galaxy population .",
    "@xcite found the characteristic velocity dispersion for the early- and late - type galaxy populations to be @xmath9  198@xmath10  km  s@xmath11 and @xmath12  117@xmath13  km  s@xmath11 at the 95 per cent confidence level ( see also @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the projected mean ellipticity for the early - type population , based on the relative numbers of quadruple and doubly imaged class gravitational lens systems , was found to be @xmath140.83 .",
    "the analyses described above required the number density of the parent population as a function of flux density to be established .",
    "this is because the derived constraints on @xmath15 depend on a knowledge of the lensing optical depth as a function of the background source redshift ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , the flat - spectrum radio source luminosity function was not well known , and measuring the redshifts of the 11 685 sources in the class complete sample was not practical . therefore , sub - samples of flat - spectrum radio sources , selected in a similar manner to the class complete sample , were formed within progressively lower flux density bins . at high flux densities",
    "the parent population redshift information was taken from the caltech  jodrell bank flat - spectrum survey ( cjf ; @xmath3  350  mjy ; @xcite ) .",
    "the complete cjf sample consists of 293 flat - spectrum radio sources , for which , 261 redshifts have been obtained ( @xcite ; unpublished ) .",
    "a redshift survey of 69 sources from the jvas sample by @xcite has provided 55 redshifts in the intermediate flux density range , 200 to 250  mjy at 4.85 ghz ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "redshift information for the parent population at the class flux density limit was reported by @xcite , who measured 27 redshifts from a sample of 42 flat - spectrum radio sources with 4.85-ghz flux densities between 25 and 50  mjy .",
    "the mean redshift of each of these flat - spectrum radio source samples is @xmath16  1.25 ; suggesting little change in the mean redshift with flux density .",
    "however , since gravitational lensing increases the apparent flux density of the background source , many lensed sources will come from a population of radio sources with flux densities below the class flux density limit .",
    "therefore , our knowledge of the flat - spectrum radio source luminosity function must be extended below 25  mjy to a few mjy ( based on the source magnifications calculated from lens galaxy mass modelling ) .",
    "we have therefore undertaken a study of the flat - spectrum radio source population at the mjy level ; hereafter referred to as the jodrell bank flat - spectrum ( jbf ) radio source survey .",
    "the aim of this study is to reduce the uncertainties in the class gravitational lensing statistics arising from the parent population luminosity function .",
    "since this project began , @xcite have extended their work on the redshift distribution of flat - spectrum radio sources down to @xmath0  3  mjy .",
    "they find the mean redshift of their sample of 33 flat - spectrum radio sources with @xmath0  5  ghz flux densities between 3 and 20  mjy to be @xmath16  0.75 ( 42 per cent completeness ) .",
    "this mean redshift is significantly lower than the trend reported from the sub - samples of flat - spectrum radio sources selected from the cjf , jvas and class surveys .",
    "the implications of such a low mean redshift for the parent population at low flux densities on the class lensing statistics is to push @xmath17 to @xmath0  1 for a flat universe , which is inconsistent with the concordance model . in a companion paper ( mckean et al . in preparation ) , we will present the optical and near infrared follow - up of a small sub - sample of jbf sources which will show that the mean redshift of the parent population is nearer @xmath16  1.2 at low flux densities .",
    "the focus of this paper , which is the first in a series of papers investigating the flat - spectrum radio source population at the mjy level , is to present the selection of the jbf sample and the number counts of the class parent population .    in section [ class ]",

    "due to the magnification of the background source by gravitational lensing , we needed to determine the number counts and redshift distribution of the parent population below the class 30  mjy flux density limit at 4.85  ghz .",
    "therefore , we selected a representative sample of faint flat - spectrum radio sources which is complete to 5  mjy .",
    "we now discuss the selection of the jbf sample .",
    "gb6 could not be used as the primary source catalogue because the jbf sample would include flat - spectrum radio sources with @xmath0  5  ghz flux densities down to 5  mjy ( recall that the gb6 catalogue is flux - density limited to @xmath3  18  mjy ) .",
    "ideally , we would carry out our own , deeper sky survey at @xmath0  5  ghz to identify a flux - density limited sample of faint flat - spectrum radio sources",
    ". however , this process would be observationally expensive .",
    "therefore , using the vla at 4.86  ghz , we undertook a targeted _ pseudo_-survey of a well defined sample of radio sources selected from the nvss catalogue ( @xmath18  2.5  mjy ) within a restricted region of the sky .",
    "from these 4.86  ghz _",

    "therefore , we now discuss any possible bias which the 4.86  ghz _",
    "pseudo_-survey may have introduced .",
    "the nvss @xmath18  2.5  mjy limit was chosen to ensure that a sample of flat - spectrum radio sources with @xmath20  5  mjy was selected .",
    "however , this limit also imposed on the _",
    "pseudo_-survey a bias against faint and highly inverted flat - spectrum radio sources with @xmath21  0.56 ( e.g. for a 5  mjy source at 4.86  ghz ) .",
    "assuming that the spectral index distribution of the flat - spectrum radio sources found by the _",
    "pseudo_-survey is the same as for the class complete sample ( see figure 3 in @xcite ) , we would expect 9.4 per cent of the sources to have @xmath21  0.5 .",
    "this does not mean that the _",
    "pseudo_-survey would not detect any of these inverted radio sources ; as we will see in section [ morph ] , 6 per cent have @xmath21  0.5 .",
    "it is only the few highly - inverted radio sources ( 3.4 per cent ) at the 5  mjy limit of the _ pseudo_-survey which would be missed .",
    "the gb6 survey was conducted with the old 300  ft ( 91  m ) telescope at green bank which had a beam size of @xmath0  3.5  arcmin , whereas our 4.86  ghz _",
    "pseudo_-survey observations were carried out using the vla , with a beam size of only a few tens of arcseconds .",
    "this change is resolution will result in two effects .",
    "first , the increase in resolution introduced the possibility of the _ pseudo_-survey observations resolving several discrete sources that would have been identified as a single radio source by gb6 .",
    "when this occurred , we summed the 4.86  ghz flux - density of the separate sources to make a single ` radio ' source ( the details of this process are given in section [ jbfsample ] ) .",
    "second , the higher resolution provided by our interferometic vla observations could result in extended radio emission being partially or completely resolved out .",
    "however , since the aim of this project is to select a sample of flat - spectrum radio sources , which are typically compact , we expect this to have a negligible effect on our sample completeness .",
    "the number of nvss radio sources with @xmath18  2.5  mjy is approximately 44 sources deg@xmath22 .",
    "therefore , to define a complete low flux density sample which was also straightforward to follow - up at optical wavelengths , sources were selected from 16 circular fields with radii ranging from 0.3 to 1 degrees within the region of sky 13@xmath23  8@xmath24 and @xmath25  0@xmath26 . where possible , fields were chosen to coincide with the anglo australian observatory 2df galaxy redshift survey @xcite in the hope that some of the flat - spectrum radio sources would have measured redshifts .",
