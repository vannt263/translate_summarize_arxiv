    "* perpendicular coherence length*. it is possible to obtain information about the perpendicular coherence properties of a ferroelectric instability from the phonon dispersions of the high symmetry ( paraelectric ) structure .",
    "let us consider a cubic structure with @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 axes aligned with the ( 100 ) directions , and focus on the @xmath45 component of polarization only .",
    "figure [ fig : distortionpattern ] includes the sketch of distortion patterns corresponding to various wave vectors with @xmath46 . the argument for batio@xmath4 [ 1 ] or knbo@xmath4 [ 2 ] is the following : as the unstable branch is dispersionless in the whole @xmath12 - x - m plane , all of the distortion patterns in fig .",
    "[ fig : distortionpattern ] are equally unstable .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bz ] for the labels of high symmetry points . )",
    "this indicates that whether a mode on the polar branch is unstable or not does not depend on the variation of displacement pattern in the direction perpendicular to the polarization , and so a one unit cell thick chain of atoms is unstable by itself  even if all the atoms in the rest of the crystal are fixed in their high symmetry positions .",
    "( one can imagine taking a superposition of phonon modes with different wave vectors to obtain a distortion pattern where only ions on such a thin chain are displaced . ) hence , the perpendicular coherence lengths for batio@xmath4 and knbo@xmath4 are zero . in other words , in a batio@xmath4 or knbo@xmath4 crystal in its high symmetry paraelectric phase , a coherent displacement of atoms that form a single unit cell thick chain can reduce energy .",
    "the situation is different for ( unstrained ) srtio@xmath4 . referring to fig.2a of the main letter , while there is a @xmath12 point instability with local polar atomic displacements as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:0_0 ] , the branch stemming from this instability is stable at the x ( fig .",
    "[ fig:0_1 ] ) and m ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1_1 ] ) points .",
    "therefore the polar instability is localized around the @xmath12-point in k - space , stiffening as one transverses about halfway along @xmath12 - x ( fig . [ fig:0_2 ] ) and also along @xmath12 - m ( fig . [ fig:2_2 ] ) points .",
    "this indicates that the frequency of the polar branch is _ not _ independent of the perpendicular component of the wave vector .",
    "a superposition of modes over this restricted volume of unstable phonon modes results in a finite thickness of the ti - o - ti chains .",
    "the minimum thickness of this unstable distortion is inversely proportional to the radius of the disks in figure 2a of main text ( @xmath47 in figure [ fig : q_crit ] ) , as this radius sets the number of unstable phonon modes that can be superposed to obtain a localized distortion .",
    "( the shortest wavelength of an unstable mode with @xmath46 is @xmath48 . )",
    "hence for unstrained srtio@xmath4 to display a polar instability , a critical thickness of unit cells in a direction perpendicular to the polarization direction , must be achieved .",
    "note , however , that this thickness scale obtained from the reciprocal space picture of the instability is a lower limit to the critical thickness , as the reciprocal space unstable disks are not perfectly flat , and that the relevant phonon branch is not perfectly dispersionless .",

    "we consider in - plane distortions only , @xmath62 , the high symmetry structures we consider have 4-fold rotational symmetry so we can assume @xmath63 without loss of generality . from now on we drop the superscript , so @xmath64 .",
    "we next impose in - plane translational invariance : the displacement of an ion in the unit cell @xmath57 does not depend on @xmath65 or @xmath66 , but only on @xmath67 .",
    "that is : @xmath68 the energy can now be expressed as @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the number of unit cells in a layer , and @xmath71 is the _ interplanar force constant per atom _ ( ipfc for short ) .",
    "@xmath71 is related to the force on an ion when a whole layer of ions are displaced , and it is intensive in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the matrix of ipfcs can be calculated using the direct method . for this purpose",
    "we built a @xmath72 supercell of srtio@xmath4 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1x1x6_disp]a ) extended in the [ 001 ] direction . in order to get all the necessary ipfcs ; 5 different displacements need to be considered : 1 for sr ( fig .",

    "for each of these , we did a dft calculation and obtained a column in the table of ipfcs , presented in table [ table : ipfc000 ] for unstrained srtio@xmath4 .",
    "next step is to build the ipfc matrices for a certain number of layers ; and diagonalize them to obtain the lowest force constant eigenvalue .",
    "size of the ipfc matrix of a slab is determined by the number of atoms in unit area ( one perovskite unit cell ) .",
    "for instance , the ipfc matrix corresponding to slab that consists of a single tio@xmath21 layer is @xmath73 : @xmath74 here the first column corresponds to the displacement of ti ion , and the other two columns correspond to the displacements of the two o ions on the same layer .",

    "the smallest eigenvalues of these two matrices are 1.36 ev / @xmath75 and 1.13 ev / @xmath75 respectively .",
    "these values give the first two data points for 0.0% strain curve in fig .",
    "3b of the main text .",
    "both @xmath78 and @xmath79 involve force constants between ions only on the same or neighboring atomic layers , in other words , in the same perovskite layer .",
    "( one perovskite layer is two atomic layers . )",
    "so , they can be obtained solely from the @xmath80 layer row in table [ table : ipfc000 ] .",
    "the ipfc for a 3 atomic layer ( tio@xmath21  sro ",
    "tio@xmath21 ) slab , on the other hand , involves force constants between different tio@xmath21 layers as well :      the last three columns / rows of this matrix are for the atoms on the second tio@xmath21 layer , the corresponding off diagonal elements are taken from the @xmath82 layer row in table [ table : ipfc000 ] . similarly , the 4 layer slab has two more column / rows : @xmath83    note that the diagonal components , which correspond to the self force constants , repeat , while the off diagonal components involve ipfcs from lower rows of table [ table : ipfc000 ] .",

    "<S> [ fig4]d we plot the results of a similar calculation except that the rumpling was artificially zeroed ; without rumpling , the degeneracy of the afe and fe modes is lifted . </S>",
    "<S> these calculations ( we found similar results for @xmath0 = 1 , 2 and 3 at two different values of strain ) prove that the rp fault indeed breaks the coherence between perovskite slabs , resulting not only in a suppression of polar distortions for @xmath40 , but also for @xmath37 polar distortions in neigboring perovskite slabs do not interact with each other significantly even at higher than quadratic order . </S>",
