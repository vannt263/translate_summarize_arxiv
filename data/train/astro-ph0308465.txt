    "the impressive convergence of recent observational facts along with some apparently successful theoretical predictions seem to indicate that the simple picture provided by the standard cold dark matter model ( scdm ) is insufficient to describe the present stage of our universe . from these results ,",
    "the most plausible picture for our world is a spatially flat scenario dominated basically by cold dark matter and an exotic component endowed with large negative pressure , usually named dark energy . despite the good observational indications for the existence of these two components ,",
    "their physical properties constitute a completely open question at present , which gives rise to the so - called dark matter and dark energy problems .",
    "dark matter , whose the leading particle candidates are the axions and the neutralinos , was originally inferred from galactic rotation curves which show a general behavior that is significantly different from the one predicted by newtonian mechanics .",
    "dark energy or _ quintessence _ , whose the main candidates are a cosmological constant @xmath3 and a relic scalar field @xmath4 , has been inferred from a combination of astronomical observations which includes distance measurements of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) indicating that the universe is speeding up not slowing down ( perlmutter _ et al .",

    "; dekel et al .",
    "while the combination of these two latter results implies the existence of a smooth component of energy that contributes with @xmath7 of the critical density , the sne ia results require this component to have a negative pressure thereby leading to a repulsive gravity ( for reviews see peebles & ratra 2003 , padmanabhan 2003 ) .    by assuming the existence of these two dominant forms of energy in the universe ,",
    "one finds that the main distinction between them comes from their gravitational effects .",
    "cold dark matter agglomerates at small scales whereas dark energy seems to be a smooth component . in certain sense , such properties",
    "are directly linked to the equation of state of both components ( for a short review see lima 2004 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the idea of a unified description for the cdm and dark energy scenarios has received much attention ( matos & urea - lopez 2000 ; davidson , karasik & lederer 2001 ; kasuya 2001 ; watterich 2002 ; padmanabhan & choudhury 2002 ) .",
    "for example , wetterich ( 2002 ) suggested that dark matter might consist of quintessence lumps while kasuya ( 2001 ) showed that spintessence - like scenarios are generally unstable to formation of @xmath8 balls which behave as pressureless matter .",
    "more recently , padmanabhan and choudhury ( 2002 ) investigated such a possibility via a string theory motivated tachyonic field .    another interesting attempt of unification was suggested by kamenshchik et al .",

    "the idea of a dark - matter - energy unification from an equation of state like eq .",
    "( 1 ) comes from the fact that the cg or the generalized chaplygin gas ( from now on we use cg to denote the chaplygin gas as well as the generalized chaplygin gas ) can naturally interpolate between nonrelativistic matter and negative - pressure dark energy regimes .",

    "there has been growing interest in exploring theoretical ( bordemann & hoppe , 1993 ; hoppe 1993 ; jackiw 2000 ; gonzalez - diaz 2003a ; 2003b ; kremer 2003 ; khalatnikov 2003 ; balakin et al .",

    "in particular , the latter reference has shown that in the context of unified dark matter / energy models the onset of the non - linear regime on small cosmological scales may lead to the breakdown of the background solution , even on large cosmological scales ( if @xmath2 is not equal to zero ) .",
    "although carefully investigated in many of its theoretical and observational aspects , the influence of a cg component in some kinematic tests such as the angular size - redshift relation ( @xmath22 ) still remains to be studied .",
    "this is the goal of the present paper . in the next sections we investigate qualitative and quantitative aspects of the angular size - redshift test in cosmological models driven by this dark matter / energy component .",
    "we first investigate the influence of the cg on the minimal redshift at which the angular size of an extragalactic source takes its minimal value .",
    "afterwards , we consider the @xmath23 data recently updated and extended by gurvits et al .",

    "( 2004 ) . to do so , we follow alcaniz et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and consider two different cases , namely , a flat scenario in which the generalized chaplygin gas together with the observed baryonic content are responsible by the dynamics of the present - day universe [ unifying dark matter - energy ] ( udme ) and a flat scenario driven by non - relativistic matter plus the generalized chaplygin gas ( cgcdm ) . for udme scenarios we adopt in our computations @xmath24 , in accordance with the estimates of the baryon density at nucleosynthesis ( burles , nollett & turner 2001 ) and the latest measurements of the hubble parameter ( freedman et al . 2002 ) . for cgcdm models we assume @xmath25 , as suggested by dynamical estimates on scales up to about @xmath26 mpc ( calberg et al . 1996 ; dekel et al .",

    "iii we analyze the constraints on the equation of state of the cg component from measurements of the angular size of compact radio sources and sne ia data and compare them with other independent limits .",
    "we end the paper by summarizing the main results in the conclusion section .",

    "for the kind of models here considered , the dimensionless function @xmath37 takes the following form @xmath38^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha + 1}}\\right\\}^{1/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath39 stands for the baryonic matter density parameter ( @xmath40 ) in udme scenarios and the baryonic + dark matter density parameter ( @xmath41 ) in cgcdm models .",
    "note that from the above equation udme models reduce to the @xmath3cdm case for @xmath42 whereas cgcdm models get the same limit , regardless of the value of @xmath2 , when @xmath43 . in both cases ,",
    "the standard einstein - de sitter behavior is fully recovered for @xmath44 ( avelino et al .",
    "2003b ; fabris et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "as widely known , the existence of a minimal redshift @xmath27 on the angular size - redshift relation may qualitatively be understood in terms of an expanding space : the light observed today from a source at high @xmath45 was emitted when the object was closer ( for a pedagogical review on this topic see janis 1986 ) .",
    "the relevant aspect here is to demonstrate how this effect may be quantified in terms of the chaplygin parameters @xmath2 and @xmath46 . to analyze the sensivity of the critical redshift to this dark component",
    ", we adopt here the approach originally presented by ( lima & alcaniz 2000a ; 2000b ) .",
    "the numerical results of this method have been confirmed by lewis & ibata ( 2002 ) through a monte carlo analysis .",
    "the redshift @xmath47 at which the angular size takes its minimal value is the one cancelling out the derivative of @xmath31 with respect to @xmath45 .",

    "1 we show the results of the above expression . panels ( a ) and ( c ) show the minimal redshift @xmath27 as a function of the parameter @xmath46 for selected values of @xmath2 in the context of cgcdm ( @xmath53 ) and udme ( @xmath24 ) models , respectively , whereas panels ( b ) and ( d ) display the @xmath54 plane for some values of @xmath46 also for cgcdm and udme scenarios ( note that the scale of @xmath27 in each panel is different ) . the minimal redshift is a much more sensitive function to the parameter @xmath46 than to the index @xmath2 . as can be seen in the panels [ and",
    "also expected from eq .",
    "( 5 ) ] , regardless of the value of @xmath2 , models with @xmath55 reduce to the einstein - de sitter case so that the standard result @xmath56 is fully recovered .",
    "as physically expected ( see , e.g. , lima & alcaniz 2000a ; 2000b ) , the smaller the contribution of the material component ( baryonic and/or dark ) the higher the minimal redshift @xmath27 . from this qualitative argument udme models would be in a better agreement with the observational data than cgcdm scenarios since the current data for milliarcsecond radio sources do not show clear evidence for a minimal angular size ( @xmath57 ) close to @xmath58 ( gurvits et al . 1999 ) .",
    "for the best fit cgcdm model obtained from an analysis involving galaxy clusters x - ray and supernova data , i.e. , @xmath59 and @xmath60 we find @xmath61 , a value that is very similar to the one predicted by the current concordance model , namely , a flat @xmath3cdm scenario with @xmath53 and also by the standard frw model with @xmath62 ( see table i of lima & alcaniz 2000a ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that if high - redshift sources present cosmological evolution , such an effect would move the position of the @xmath57 to extremely high redshift .",

    "since the main difference between the analysis performed in this section and the previous ones that have used these angular size data to constrain cosmological parameters is the background cosmology , we refer the reader to previous works for a more complete analysis and detailed formulas ( see , for instance , jackson & dodgson 1997 ; 2003 ; vishwakarma 2001 ; lima & alcaniz 2002 ; zhu & fujimoto 2002 ; jain et al .",

    "however , since the nature of these dark components ( matter and energy ) is not well understood , an important task nowadays in cosmology is to investigate the existing possibilities in the light of the current observational data . in this paper",
    "we have focused our attention on some observational aspects of cosmologies driven by an exotic dark energy component named generalized chaplygin gas .",

    "<S> an exotic dark component , named generalized chaplygin gas ( cg ) and parameterized by an equation of state @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are arbitrary constants , is one of the possible candidates for dark energy as well as for a unified scenario of dark matter / energy . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we investigate qualitative and quantitative aspects of the angular size - redshift test in cosmological models driven by such a dark component . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the prospects for constraining the cg equation of state from measurements of the angular size at low and high redshift radio sources and also from a joint analysis involving angular size and supernova data . a detailed discussion about the influence of the cg on the minimal redshift at which the angular size of an extragalactic source takes its minimal value is also presented . </S>"
