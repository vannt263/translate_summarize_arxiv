    "a charge - density wave ( cdw ) is a common collective phenomenon in solids consisting of a periodic modulation of the electron density accompanied by a distortion of the crystal lattice . for a one - dimensional system of non - interacting electrons ,",
    "the phenomenon is described by the peierl s instability , where a divergence in the real part of the electronic susceptibility at twice the fermi wave vector drives a metal - to - insulator transition . in extensions of this idea",
    "to real materials with anisotropic band structures and quasi-1d fermi surfaces , fermi - surface nesting is often cited to explain charge - ordering tendencies . however ,",
    "geometric fermi - surface nesting ( i.e. , existence of parallel regions of the fermi surface separated by a single wave vector * q * ) is related to the _ imaginary _ part of the noninteracting susceptibility rather than the real part , so it is not directly connected to the peierl s mechanism.@xcite indeed , calculations for a number of cdw materials , including nbse@xmath0 , tase@xmath0 , tas@xmath0 , and cete@xmath3 , have found little or no correlation between the cdw ordering vector * q*@xmath4 , and peaks in the geometric nesting function ( imaginary part of @xmath5).@xcite nor does * q*@xmath4 coincide with sharp features in the real part of @xmath5 in most of these cases . instead , these studies pointed to the importance of the momentum - dependent electron - phonon coupling , which softens selected phonon modes to the point of instability .",
    "advances in the synthesis of low - dimensional materials provide new opportunities to test these ideas . in going from quasi-2d bulk nbse@xmath0 to the 2d monolayer , for example , the number of bands crossing the fermi level decreases from three to one , which could reveal information about the role played by different bands in driving the cdw instability .",
    "the stability and structure of the cdw phase in monolayer nbse@xmath0 , however , remains under debate .",
    "density functional calculations predict that both the monolayer and bilayer have cdw instabilities , but with a shifted * q*@xmath4 and a larger energy gain compared to the bulk.@xcite a recent experimental study of bulk and 2d nbse@xmath0 on sio@xmath0 used the raman signature of the cdw amplitude mode to estimate the cdw transition temperature and reported an increase of @xmath6 from about 33 k in the bulk to 145 k in the monolayer.@xcite this result , attributed in ref . to an enhanced electron - phonon coupling due to reduced screening in two dimensions ,",
    "is qualitatively consistent with the dft predictions , but does not address the question of the cdw superstructure . on the other hand , another study of single - layer nbse@xmath0 , this time on bilayer graphene , reported scanning tunneling microscopy / spectroscopy ( stm / sts ) measurements showing a cdw transition at a lower temperature than the bulk but with the same * q*@xmath4 ordering vector.@xcite discrepancies between the two experimental studies and between experiment and theory could be due in part to substrate effects , as 2d materials tend to be highly sensitive to the environment and to the substrate . initial studies of 1t - tas@xmath0 , for example , suggested that it completely loses the low - temperature commensurate cdw phase upon thinning to about 10 - 15 layers,@xcite but later it was shown that oxidation can suppress the formation of the commensurate phase.@xcite raman signatures of the commensurate cdw were later found in single - layer 1t - tas@xmath0 samples with limited exposure to air.@xcite in using 2d materials to probe the cdw transition and the effect of dimensionality , it is therefore crucial to differentiate behavior intrinsic to each material from effects due to the environment .    in bulk form ,",
    "tas@xmath0 is a layered transition - metal dichalcogenide for which the 1 t and 2h polymorphs are competitive in energy , and both can be synthesized .",
    "both the 1 t and 2h polymorphs undergo cdw transitions as the temperature is lowered .",
    "recently , it was reported that single - layer tas@xmath0 grown epitaxially on a au ( 111 ) substrate adopts the 1h structure rather than 1t.@xcite low - energy electron diffraction ( leed ) and stm data indicate that on au ( 111 ) , single - layer 1h - tas@xmath0 does not undergo a cdw transition , at least down to @xmath7 k. this is in contrast to bulk 2h - tas@xmath0 , which develops a @xmath2 cdw periodicity below about 75 k. in addition , a comparison of angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) data to the band structure calculated for a free - standing monolayer suggests that the substrate causes the material to become @xmath8-doped with a carrier concentration of approximately 0.3 electrons per unit cell.@xcite    in this paper , we use dft calculations to investigate whether the observed suppression of the cdw in monolayer 1h - tas@xmath0 is intrinsic or a consequence of its interaction with the metallic substrate . in the harmonic approximation",
    ", we find that a free - standing single layer of 1h - tas@xmath0 has lattice instabilities that are very similar to its bulk counterpart .",
    "when the monolayer is electron - doped , however , the 1h structure becomes dynamically stable , implying that substrate - induced doping is the likely reason for the suppression of the cdw observed in ref . .",
    "the strong effect of doping and a secondary effect of lattice strain on the cdw transition in this material give insight on what drives the transition .",
    "we examine the role of electron - phonon coupling by calculating the phonon self - energy .",
    "we find that the contribution to the real part of the phonon self - energy from the single band that crosses the fermi level is largely responsible for the momentum dependence of the soft mode , but the bare phonon frequency ( unscreened from electrons at the fermi level ) also plays a role .",
    "we performed density - functional theory calculations using the quantum - espresso@xcite package .",
    "the exchange - correlation interaction was treated with the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) generalized gradient approximation.@xcite to describe the interaction between electrons and ionic cores , we used ultrasoft@xcite ta pseudopotentials and norm - conserving@xcite s pseudopotentials .",
    "electronic wave functions were expanded in a plane - wave basis with kinetic energy cutoffs of 47 ( 53 ) ry for scalar ( fully ) relativistic pseudopotentials .",
    "integrations over the brillouin zone ( bz ) were performed using a uniform grid of @xmath9 * k * points , with an occupational smearing width of @xmath10 ry .    to simulate electronic doping ,",
    "electrons were added to the unit cell along with a compensating uniform positive background .",
    "a single layer of 1h - tas@xmath0 was modeled using a supercell with the out - of - plane lattice parameter fixed at @xmath11  , corresponding to about 9    of vacuum between layers .",
    "this ensured that for the range of electron doping explored , spurious vacuum states that originate from the periodic boundary conditions stay well above the fermi level . the in - plane lattice constant and the atomic positions were fully relaxed at each doping level .",

    ", we used a less dense grid of @xmath13 * q*-points . while this does not capture all the fine structure in the phonon dispersions , it is sufficient to test the effect of spin - orbit coupling .",
    "in fact , even fourier interpolation on the @xmath12 * q*-grid does not fully capture the sharp features along certain directions in the brillouin zone where direct calculations of the phonon frequency are needed .",

    "[ eq : se - imag ] with constant matrix elements , does not have sharp structure near @xmath38 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma - chi](d ) ] , and instead has three sharp peaks surrounding the @xmath30 point .",
    "this means that the sharp peak in the linewidth at @xmath38 must be due to large electron - phonon matrix elements between states on the fermi surface , rather than to the geometry of the fermi surface itself . with electron doping ( @xmath35 ) , the maximum values of the linewidth are much smaller and occur elsewhere in the brillouin zone , whether the lattice constant is allowed to relax [ fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma - chi](c ) ] or not [ fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma - chi](b ) ] .",
    "this suggests that the momentum dependence of the electron - phonon coupling of states at the fermi level plays an important role in picking out the primary instability at @xmath38 .",
    "however , focusing on states at the fermi level is not sufficient to understand the broader region of instability .        the real part of the phonon self - energy @xmath53 is directly related to the renormalization of phonon frequencies due to electron screening . from perturbation theory , @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the bare phonon frequency .",
    "while it is conceptually appealing to define the bare frequencies as the completely unscreened ionic frequencies , such a starting point leads to results that lie outside the range of validity of the perturbative expression in eq .",
    "[ eq : perturbation - theory ] . instead , we define the bare frequencies to be the frequencies obtained neglecting the metallic screening due to electrons in the isolated ta @xmath24 band crossing the fermi level .",
    "it has been shown that this non self - consistent definition is perfectly justified in the framework of linear response theory.@xcite in this case , we limit the sum in the phonon self - energy ( eq . [ eq : se - real ] ) to intraband transitions within that band and denote it as @xmath56 . the corresponding bare ( in the sense of unscreened by metallic electrons ) frequencies",
    "are denoted @xmath57 .",
    "while the bare frequencies are not directly accessible , we can estimate them from the fully screened frequencies @xmath48 ( as obtained from density functional perturbation theory ) and the perturbative correction @xmath58 by inverting eq .",

    "[ fig : self - energy ] shows the square of the phonon frequencies and the self - energy correction , @xmath59 , along high - symmetry directions in the brillouin zone . for comparison , @xmath60 , the real part of the bare electronic susceptibility , given by eq .",
    "[ eq : se - real ] with constant matrix elements and limited to the band at the fermi level , is also plotted . for the undoped material",
    ", @xmath61 has a minimum at @xmath38 , but the momentum dependence between @xmath38 and @xmath36 does not match that of the calculated frequencies .",
    "similarly , the momentum dependence of @xmath61 does not correlate with the phonon softening when the material is doped to @xmath35 , with or without relaxation of the lattice constant . from fig .",
    "[ fig : self - energy ] , we see , however , that the momentum dependence of the phonon self - energy roughly follows that of the phonon softening , indicating the importance of the electron - phonon matrix elements in @xmath62 .",
    "the self - energy includes contributions from states throughout the band crossing the fermi level , in contrast to the linewidth , which provides information about the electron - phonon coupling at the fermi level .",
    "the square of the bare frequencies ( @xmath63 ) estimated using eq .",
    "[ eq : perturbation - theory ] are plotted with dashed lines in the top panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : self - energy ] .",
    "note that in the regions of instabilities , the self - energy correction is comparable to or larger than the square of the bare frequency , possibly raising into question the degree to which the perturbative expression is valid .",
    "nevertheless , if we use the expression to estimate the bare frequencies , we find some surprising results .",
    "for the undoped material , the dispersion of the bare frequency has sharp dips at both @xmath38 and @xmath37 .",
    "thus , while phonon softening due to screening of the band at the fermi level accounts for most of the momentum dependence of the unstable modes , structure in the bare frequencies contributes as well . upon doping to @xmath35 , but holding the lattice constant fixed at @xmath33 , the local minima at @xmath38 and @xmath37 disappear in both the self - energy and the bare frequency , stabilizing those modes . at @xmath36 , however , neither the self - energy nor the bare frequency change significantly with doping , so a residual instability remains at @xmath36 .",
    "when the lattice constant of the doped system is relaxed , the self - energy undergoes relatively minor changes , while the bare frequency at @xmath36 hardens significantly .",
    "thus it is the lattice - constant dependence of the bare frequency that stabilizes the @xmath36 point phonon at a doping of @xmath35 .",
    "the dramatic hardening of this mode upon a 2.5% lattice expansion is surprising , as phonons usually soften with lattice expansion .",
    "indeed most of the other phonon modes in the doped material soften slightly with the lattice expansion .    to summarize , we find that the primary cdw ordering vector coincides with very strong electron - phonon coupling at the fermi surface , but the full momentum dependence of the phonons in the wide region of instability is described more completely by the momentum dependence of @xmath64 , the phonon self - energy due to screening from the band crossing the fermi level .",
    "the momentum dependence of the corresponding bare phonon frequencies , @xmath65 , however , also plays a role .",
    "regarding the behavior of the instabilities with doping and lattice strain , the bare frequencies provide the primary contributions , but the changes in the phonon self - energy , especially with doping , are essential . while recent studies of cdw materials have focused on the role of electron - phonon coupling as the driving mechanism , we find that , for monolayer 1h - tas@xmath0 , taking into account screening arising from electron - phonon coupling in the band crossing the fermi level by itself is not enough , and one must consider how the bare frequencies depend on momentum and doping as well .",
    "unfortunately it is not possible to determine if the momentum , doping , and strain dependencies deduced for the bare frequencies come from the response of other bands away from the fermi level or appear as features in the completely unscreened ionic frequencies .",
    "our calculations show that in the harmonic approximation the free - standing monolayer of 1h - tas@xmath0 is unstable to cdw distortions with the same ordering vector as the bulk .",
    "we also find that electron doping stabilizes the lattice .",
    "these results indicate that the cdw suppression found in experiments of 1h - tas@xmath0 on au is not intrinsic but rather induced by the substrate.@xcite according to our harmonic calculations , in addition to increasing the number of charge carriers , electron doping induces a lattice expansion . while the addition of charge carriers itself stabilizes most of the soft phonon modes , at the harmonic level a residual instability remains if the lattice constant is not allowed to relax . in the experiments on the au ( 111 ) substrate ,",
    "the uncertainty in the measured lattice constant was about 3%,@xcite which is slightly larger than the lattice expansion we predict for electron doping of @xmath35 .",
    "hence in the experimental system , it remains an open question as to how much the substrate affects the lattice constant , and how that in turn influences the lattice instabilities .",
    "we believe that the suppression of cdw by electron doping is robust also against anharmonic effects .",
    "indeed in metals , anharmonic effects tend to enhance phonon frequencies and suppress cdw instabilities .",
    "these effects , not considered in this work , could reduce the tendency towards cdw at @xmath17 , but will not change the qualitative result that electron doping removes the cdw in this system .",
    "recently , it was pointed out that for metallic 2d materials on substrates , the shift in the bands measured in arpes experiments may not provide a reliable estimate of charge transfer across the interface.@xcite in particular , if there is significant hybridization between the substrate and 2d material , the actual charge transfer will be reduced . the impact of substrate hybridization on the cdw instability in monolayer 1h - tas@xmath0 warrants future investigation .",
    "this system , like other transition - metal dichalcogenides , offers an opportunity to better understand the intrinsic origins of cdws .",
    "going beyond previous studies that emphasized the importance of the momentum dependence of the electron - phonon interaction in driving the cdw , we find that the momentum , doping , and strain dependencies of the bare phonon frequencies also play a role .",
    "this system also underscores the importance of disentangling environmental and intrinsic effects in 2d materials , and provides an example of using the substrate to tune the properties of the material .",
