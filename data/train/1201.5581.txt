    "there is increasing evidence for supernova shock waves propagating in dense , optically thick , mass loss regions .",
    "type iin supernovae , which have narrow lines of hydrogen and other species in their spectra @xcite , typically have light curves where circumstellar interaction provides the power ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the lines are indicative of continuing circumstellar interaction and the luminosity implies a high circumstellar density .",
    "narrow h lines with broad , symmetric wings observed at early times can be interpreted as the result of electron scattering in a medium with optical depth of @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "type iin spectral features have been observed in number of highly luminous supernovae , including sn 2006gy @xcite .",
    "sn 2006gy , which was especially luminous in the optical , had an x - ray luminosity ( or upper limit ) that was orders of magnitude below its optical luminosity @xcite ; the question arises of whether the lack of a high x - ray luminosity is consistent with strong circumstellar interaction @xcite .",
    "there is the potential for x - ray emission provided that there is a viscous shock wave that heats the gas in the circumstellar interaction .",
    "a viscous shock front is expected to form in a dense wind provided the optical depth in the external medium @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the shock velocity @xcite . at larger optical depths the shock wave is mediated by radiation provided that the ratio of radiation to matter pressure is @xmath8 in the downstream region @xcite , which is the case for the shocks considered here .",
    "there is thus the potential for hot gas and its emission from shock waves in moderately optically thick regions @xcite .",
    "here we consider the x - ray emission from shocks in dense circumstellar regions , concentrating on the optically thick case .",
    "any emitted x - ray emission has the possibility of being scattered or absorbed , changing both the supernova surroundings and the escaping x - ray radiation .",
    "an understanding of how the shock power is eventually radiated is crucial for understanding multiwavelength observations of these events .",
    "we discuss the shock structure and x - ray emission in section 2 and the implications for observations in section 3 .",
    "we assume that the mass loss can be described by a steady wind flow ; the actual mass loss is unlikely to be steady , but this case should illustrate the basic physical situation . if the mass loss at rate @xmath9 is in a steady wind at a velocity @xmath10 , the density @xmath11 can be specified by a density parameter , @xmath12 , scaled to a @xmath13 and @xmath14 wind so that @xmath15 in cgs units . the optical depth in the wind to the dense shell position @xmath16 is @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the opacity @xmath19 in units of 0.34 @xmath20 g@xmath21 , appropriate for electron scattering with @xmath22 .",
    "if the expansion of @xmath16 can be expressed @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the age @xcite , we have @xmath25 so that @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the expansion velocity of the shell @xmath2 in units of @xmath28 and @xmath29 has been assumed .",
    "this relation with @xmath30 is shown in fig .  1 , which also shows the line @xmath31 above which a viscous shock does not form .",
    "in the figure , and in the following , we assume @xmath32 .      to give an estimate of the shock velocity , we note that for the supernova model used by @xcite ( @xmath33 outer density profile ) , the velocity of gas at the reverse shock wave is @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the energy in units of @xmath36 ergs and @xmath37 is the ejecta mass in units of @xmath38 .",
    "the velocity @xmath39 of the interaction shell is also the shock velocity @xmath7 if the velocity of matter immediately ahead of the shock is negligible .",
    "there are two reasons that @xmath7 might be less than @xmath39 .",
    "one is that the presupernova wind has a significant velocity .",
    "wind velocities deduced from narrow h@xmath40 line features in type iin supernovae are generally in the range @xmath41 ( table 5 of * ? ? ?",
    "second , there may be radiative acceleration of the mass loss gas .    to estimate the acceleration",
    ", we assume that the forward shock velocity is @xmath42 and that the shock wave cools rapidly ( compared to the age ) .",
    "these assumptions should give the maximum luminosity and thus the maximal effect of radiative acceleration .",
    "the luminosity in this case is @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the wind density immediately ahead of the shock wave .",
    "the acceleration is @xmath45 , where @xmath1 is the speed of light , so that the gas is accelerated to a velocity @xmath46 if we normalize to the shock velocity , @xmath47 the result is that @xmath48 if @xmath49 . the formation of a viscous shock requires that @xmath0 , so we expect significant acceleration near the time of shock breakout , if it occurs in the wind region , and declining acceleration at lower optical depths .",
    "the breakout radiation from a hot shell of radiation can also accelerate the wind gas , but the luminosity of this event is comparable to the luminosity that might be generated by the continuing shock interaction @xcite .",
    "@xcite obtain a similar result for the acceleration by breakout radiation and note that the shock is collisionless .",
    "since the acceleration is important only at fairly large optical depth and we will find that x - rays do not escape at those depths , we neglect the acceleration here .",
    "the cooling processes for the postshock hot gas are expected to be bremsstrahlung and inverse compton cooling . at the high densities of interest here ,",
    "the dominant cooling emission is from the forward shock region .",
    "x - ray emission from supernovae is often discussed in terms the softer reverse shock emission @xcite . however , as the density increases , the reverse shock emission becomes limited by rapid cooling at a lower circumstellar density than at the forward shock . when both the forward and reverse shocks are in the radiative regime , the ratio of forward to reverse shock power is @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the supernova density power law index @xcite . for @xmath52 ,",
    "the ratio is 11 .",
    "in addition , the dense shell that forms between the shock fronts can absorb x - ray emission produced at the reverse shock . in the noncooling regime ,",
    "the bremsstrahlung emission from the forward shock region is @xcite @xmath53 in the cooling regime , the luminosity is @xmath54 where @xmath27 is the shock velocity in units of @xmath28 .",
    "the actual luminosity can not be greater than that in the cooling case .",
    "the cooling condition is that @xmath55 , or @xmath56 the cooling condition is shown in fig .  1 ; it is close to where the medium is optically thick .",
    "since the two sources of luminosity for inverse compton cooling ( shock breakout emission and emission from continuing interaction ) are comparable at early times and the continuing interaction eventually can dominate , here we consider only the interaction luminosity source .",
    "if the forward shock is cooling , the postshock luminosity is @xmath57 .",
    "we assume that a fraction @xmath58 of this luminosity is reradiated as approximately blackbody thermal radiation and take @xmath59 as a reference value ; backscattering of the radiation can cause deviations from this value . in the optically thick regime ( @xmath60 ) , the energy density in radiation is thus @xmath61 the inverse compton energy loss per unit volume is @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the electron density in the hot gas , @xmath64 is the thomson cross section , @xmath65 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath66 is the electron mass , and @xmath67 is the electron temperature . in the radiative , optically thick regime ,",
    "the ratio of the bremsstrahlung cooling rate to the compton cooling rate is @xmath68 where equation ( 3 - 56 ) of @xcite was used for @xmath69 .",
    "the boundary between the cooling mechanisms is shown in fig .  1 .    moving to the non - cooling case , we note that @xmath70 in the cooling case , but the luminosity of the shell @xmath71 in the noncooling case , where @xmath72 is the emitting volume of the hot gas .",
    "we again assume that the supernova luminosity is primarily from circumstellar interaction so that the photospheric luminosity is @xmath73 .",
    "more specifically , we find @xmath74 the electron scattering optical depth through the hot shell , @xmath75 , is the same as that through the preshock wind gas , @xmath76 , provided h and he are ionized and dominate the abundances , and the shell gas is noncooling .",
    "the value of @xmath75 drops below unity in the noncooling regime .",
    "inverse compton cooling is important at higher shock velocities and wind densities ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "this contrasts with the case where the radiation field is due to the supernova , independent of the circumstellar interaction , when bremsstrahlung emission becomes a more important coolant at high density @xcite . at the higher densities in our case , inverse compton again becomes important due to the strong radiation field created by the interaction . as indicated in fig .  1 , the condition that the shock front be cooling merges with the transition between inverse compton and bremsstrahlung cooling at higher shock velocities .",
    "the reason for the absence of a region in which the shock is non - cooling with cooling dominated by inverse compton is our assumption that the supernova luminosity is produced by the shock interaction .    if the nuclei and electrons do not rapidly achieve equilibrium in the shock transition , the nuclei are heated to @xmath77 k in the shock front .",
    "the balance of electron cooling by inverse compton losses with heating by coulomb collisions leads to a temperature @xmath78 k , where @xmath79 is the fraction of the postshock energy density in radiation and a coulomb logarithm of 30 is assumed @xcite ; @xmath67 may be higher if there is collisionless heating of electrons . from equation ( [ urad ] ) , we have @xmath80 , so that when the viscous shock first forms @xmath81 , but it declines thereafter .",
    "the electrons are heated to their equilibrium value ( @xmath82 k ) when @xmath83 .",
    "nonequilibrium is important only for high shock velocities ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the criterion for equilibrium when the cooling is dominated by bremsstrahlung at lower densities is the same as that discussed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* equation 12 ) and is shown in fig .  1 .    for @xmath84 , bremsstrahlung is expected at close to the postshock temperature and , since the emission goes in toward the dense photosphere as well as outward , with a luminosity approximately equal to that from the photosphere .",
    "as the optical depth to the emission region increases , there is more of a chance of an outward going photon being scattered in toward the photosphere , so the hard x - ray luminosity declines relative to the photospheric emission . in the cooling case ,",
    "the electron scattering optical depth through the hot , shocked region is @xmath85 , where @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "if inverse compton dominates the cooling and @xmath60 , @xmath88 is given by equations ( [ urad ] ) and ( [ lam ] ) , and we have @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the mean particle weight divided by the proton mass @xmath91 . we thus find that @xmath92 , so that a typical outgoing photon from the dense shell scatters at most once in the hot gas ; since the electron energies are @xmath93 , the photon energy is changed by a factor @xmath94 . for @xmath60 , photons can be scattered back through the hot region , but production of photons up to x - ray energies is not expected in this way because the ingoing photons are absorbed by the dense shell and ejecta .",
    "we thus expect that , in the regime where inverse compton cooling dominates , the x - ray emission declines relative to emission at lower photon energies .",
    "this is also true when bremsstrahlung cooling dominates and @xmath60 because initially outgoing photons can be scattered back across the emission region and absorbed in the dense shell .",
    "the x - ray radiation from the hot shell must escape through the cooler unshocked envelope of circumstellar gas .",
    "both scattering and absorption of the photons can be important .",
    "comptonization affects the escape of photons at the high energy end .",
    "the maximum energy is @xmath95 kev , where the electron scattering optical depth @xmath96 for our assumptions .",
    "this result is due to the fact that electron recoil gives a change of photon wavelength @xmath97 for each scattering , where @xmath98 is planck s constant , and the number of scatterings is @xmath99 .",
    "detailed calculations show that there is not a sharp cut - off at the energy , but the spectrum becomes steep ( e.g. , fig .",
    "15 of * ? ?",
    "* ) . in section 1",
    ", we noted that a viscous shock could form at @xmath100 so that @xmath101 can be as small as @xmath102 kev .",
    "the emission from the hot gas goes into heating and ionization of the preshock gas until the shock wave reaches moderate optical depth .",
    "photoionization of the preshock medium is important for the absorption of x - rays from the shocked region .",
    "if the preshock medium is completely ionized , we expect relatively little absorption , while incomplete ionization leads to substantial absorption for our parameters . in considering the photoionization of the preshock gas",
    ", we will be assuming that the photoionization is determined by the current x - ray luminosity , i.e. that steady state conditions apply .",
    "this requires that the recombination time be less than the age , which is generally true for the high densities considered here .    if the medium is optically thin , photoionization is related to the ionization parameter @xmath103 in cgs units , where @xmath51 is the density and @xmath104 is the distance from the luminosity source . for an @xmath105 density distribution ,",
    "the @xmath106 parameter is independent of radius .",
    "if we are in the cooling regime and the ionizing luminosity is @xmath107 , the ionization parameter is @xmath108 , independent of @xmath109 . for lower values of @xmath109 in the non - cooling regime , we have @xmath110 .",
    "the ionization parameter is highest in the high density regime of interest here and drops at lower densities in the noncooling regime .",
    "photoionization calculations have been previously carried out and we briefly summarize results for an emitting gas temperature of 10 kev , or @xmath111 k. for a value @xmath112 , the medium is completely ionized @xcite .",
    "the elements c , n , and o are completely ionized for @xmath113 ; ionization of the heavier elements ( s and fe ) requires @xmath114 @xcite .    to extend these results to a hotter radiation field",
    ", we used the photoionization code cloudy @xcite .",
    "we started by using a radiation field set by a @xmath115 k bremsstrahlung spectrum ; the results were consistent with those described above .",
    "we went to higher bremsstrahlung temperatures to allow for higher shock velocities ; at @xmath116 , the postshock temperature is @xmath117 k. at @xmath118 , changing the bremsstrahlung temperature does not have much effect on ionization structure or @xmath67 . for @xmath119",
    ", a higher temperature luminosity leads to a lower @xmath67 and less ionization . but for @xmath120 , a higher temperature luminosity produces a higher @xmath67 and more ionization . for example , at @xmath115 k , the cno elements are completely ionized at @xmath121 , s becomes ionized at @xmath122 , and everything is ionized at @xmath112 .",
    "however , for @xmath123 k , cno do not become ionized until @xmath124 , s still becomes ionized at @xmath118 , but everything is ionized at @xmath125 .",
    "these results can be understood since the ionization potential is @xmath126 , where @xmath127 is the atomic number .",
    "the higher temperature emission has higher energy photons , which are less efficient at ionizing atoms with lower ionization potentials ( compared to the photon energy ) , but are more effective at ionizing atoms with high ionization potentials .    for @xmath128",
    ", we expect that @xmath129 , and the value of @xmath106 mainly depends on @xmath2 . for @xmath130 ,",
    "the gas is completely ionized , while for @xmath131 only partial ionization is likely .",
    "another issue is whether the preshock medium is optically thick in the photoionization continua , and the incident radiation field is depleted in crossing the circumstellar gas . using the results of @xcite",
    ", we find that at the higher temperatures of interest ( @xmath117 k ) for the ionizing radiation , photon depletion is negligible and ionization remains nearly constant with radius . at lower temperatures for the radiation ( @xmath111 k ) , there is a transition to the stromgren regime .",
    "the situation changes if the wind is moderately optically thick to electron scattering .",
    "an effect of electron scattering is to reverse the motion of photons , so that the energy density of ionizing photons is increased ; the time spent by photons in a region is increased by @xmath132 ( equation [ [ urad ] ] ) , so that the rate of ionizations ( and @xmath106 ) is increased by the same factor ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "while this effect favors higher photoionization and the escape of x - rays , there are several effects that disfavor high x - ray emission .",
    "first , compton degradation in the wind leads to the loss of the high energy photons , as discussed above ; emission above 2 kev is suppressed when @xmath133 .",
    "second , at moderate optical depths inverse compton cooling tends to dominate bremsstrahlung ( fig .  1 )",
    ", so that x - ray emission is a smaller fraction of the shock power ; inverse compton is more important at higher shock velocities .",
    "in addition , initially outgoing x - ray photons have some chance of being scattered back and absorbed by the dense shell .",
    "finally , at optical depths @xmath134 , these two effects are likely to be larger than the increase in the ionizing radiation field , so that the ionization parameter is decreased and there is an increased chance of photoabsorption of the x - ray emission .",
    "photoabsorption is important at low x - ray energies while compton degradation is important at high x - ray energies .",
    "an accurate calculation of the x - ray emission is complicated and beyond the current paper .",
    "an analogous physical situation is x - ray emission from optically thick accretion onto white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the photon trapping limit @xmath135 here corresponds to an accretion rate at the eddington limit in the accretion case .",
    "a difference is that the emission from the white dwarf surface can maintain complete ionization of the preshock gas , which is not necessarily the case here .",
    "most of the x - ray observations of type iin supernovae in dense media are an age @xmath136 yr and sometimes much greater , so that the objects do not fall in the parameter space shown in fig .",
    "1 . however , sn 2006gy , with an estimated @xmath137 @xcite , was observed with _ chandra _ on 2006 nov 14 , at an age of @xmath5 months @xcite . @xcite inferred a detection , with all counts at energies @xmath94 kev and an unabsorbed @xmath138 kev luminosity of @xmath139 assuming @xmath140 kev .",
    "from the same data , @xcite inferred a nondetection with an upper limit of @xmath141 , assuming a photon index of 1.8 . in either case , the x - ray luminosity was much less than the observed photospheric luminosity of @xmath142 @xcite . in the model of @xcite for sn 2006gy ,",
    "the shock wave radiation broke out in the mass loss region , so the optical depth outside the shock was initially @xmath143 .",
    "the parameters for the x - ray observation give @xmath144 , near the @xmath135 line in fig .  1 .",
    "@xcite estimate @xmath145 near the time of peak optical luminosity so , as discussed in section 2.2 , comptonization by itself could limit the escaping photons to @xmath146 kev , and",
    "the loss of ionizing radiation would allow photoabsorption .",
    "our discussion suggests the following sequence , as the density of surrounding mass loss increases . at low density ,",
    "the optical luminosity is dominated by radioactivity and shock heating of the progenitor ; x - ray emission from interaction is initially a small part of the luminosity , although it might become a larger part at late times when other power sources fade . as the optical depth in the wind approaches unity , interaction typically dominates the power input and x - ray emission can be a signficant part of the power . at higher densities",
