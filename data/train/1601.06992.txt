    "since haider and liu postulated a possible existence of @xmath1-mesic nuclei  @xcite , many experimental groups performed measurements dedicated to search for the new kind of nuclear matter in which the @xmath1 meson is bound within a nucleus via the strong interaction . however , till now , none of the experiments have brought the clear evidence for the bound state existence .",
    "the status of the search was recently described in the following reviews  @xcite .",
    "some of the experiments set the upper limits for the bound state production in several processes .",
    "group estimated the upper limit of total cross section for @xmath5 process to the value of 270  nb and for @xmath5 @xmath6-@xmath7 @xmath8 to the value 70  nb .",
    "cosy - gem measurement of @xmath9 @xmath10 brought the upper limit of the total cross section for @xmath11-@xmath12 production equal to 0.46 @xmath13 0.16(stat ) @xmath13 0.06(syst )  nb  @xcite .",
    "the wasa measurement in 2008 results in the upper limit of of the total cross section for the @xmath14-@xmath12 creation in @xmath2 @xmath15 reaction , which varies from 20  nb to 27  nb for the range of the bound state width from 5  mev to 35  mev  @xcite .",
    "the measurement carried out two years later permitted to lower the upper bound for the cross section of @xmath16-@xmath17 @xmath4 process down to the value of few nanobarns .",
    "additionally , the upper limit of the preliminary total cross section was determined for the first time for the @xmath14-@xmath12 production in @xmath2 @xmath18 reaction  @xcite .",
    "this paper presents the preliminary results obtained for the aforementioned processes .",
    "in november 2010 , wasa - at - cosy collaboration carried out the experiment dedicated for the search for @xmath0-@xmath1 bound states in @xmath2 @xmath3 and @xmath2 @xmath4 reactions . the ramped beam technique was used to vary the momentum continuously from 2.127  gev / c to 2.422  gev / c , which corresponds to a range of excess energies @xmath19 from -70 to 30  mev  @xcite .",
    "the detailed description of the wasa experimental setup is presented in  @xcite .",
    "analysis for the @xmath2 @xmath3 and @xmath2 @xmath4 reactions were carried out independently .",
    "next , the set of the cross - check tests was performed to assure the consistency at the pid level .",
    "the @xmath20 ions and nucleon - pion pairs were identified in the forward and central detector , respectively .",
    "the deposited energy patterns in thick scintillator layers of the forward hodoscope was used to identify the @xmath20 ions ( the ) .",
    "the neutral pion @xmath21 was reconstructed based on the invariant mass of two gamma quanta while the neutron was identified via the missing mass technique  @xcite .",
    "the proton and @xmath22 identification was based on the measurement of the energy loss in the thin plastic scintillator barrel combined with the energy deposited in the electromagnetic calorimeter  @xcite .",
    "the events which may correspond to the bound states production were selected using criteria based on monte carlo simulations for the @xmath1-mesic nuclei production and decay .",
    "we apply the cuts in the momentum of @xmath20 in the cm frame , nucleon cm kinetic energy , pion cm kinetic energy and the opening angle between nucleon - pion pair in the cm .",
    "the region rich in signal corresponds to the momenta of the @xmath20 in the range . for this region",
    "the excitation function was obtained by normalizing the events selected in individual excess energy intervals by the corresponding integrated luminosities ( the detailed description of the luminosity determination one can find in ref .",
    "@xcite ) and corrected for acceptance and efficiency .",
    "the excitation function does not reveal the resonance - like structure , which could be the signature of the @xmath1-mesic nuclei existence  @xcite , however the interpretation of the results is still in progress .",
    "so far , the upper limit of the total cross section for the @xmath16-@xmath17 @xmath3 and @xmath16-@xmath17 @xmath4 processes was determined on the 90% confidence level .",
    "preliminary , the upper limits were obtained by the fit of the sum of the polynomial and breit - wigner functions to the experimentally determined excitation functions .",
    "it varies from 21 to 36 nb for the first channel and from 5 to 9 nb for the second channel for the bound state width ranging from 5 to 50 mev ( see fig .  [ result_sigma_upp ] ) .",
