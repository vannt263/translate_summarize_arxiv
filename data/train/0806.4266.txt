    "a fact usually assumed in astrophysics is that the main part of the mass of a typical spiral galaxy is concentrated in a thin disk ( @xcite ) .",
    "accordingly , the obtention of the gravitational potential generated by an idealized thin disk is a problem of great astrophysical relevance and so , through the years , different approaches has been used to obtain such kind of thin disk models .",
    "wyse and mayall ( @xcite ) studied thin disks by superposing an infinite family of elementary disks of different radii .",
    "brandt ( @xcite ) and brandt and belton ( @xcite ) constructed flat galaxy disks by the flattening of a distribution of matter whose surface of equal density were similar spheroids .",
    "a simple potential - density pair for a thin disk model was introduced by kuzmin ( @xcite ) and then rederived by toomre ( @xcite ) as the first member of a generalized family of models .",
    "the toomre models are obtained by solving the laplace equation in cylindrical coordinates subject to appropriated boundary conditions on the disk and at infinity .",
    "the kuzmin and toomre models of thin disks , although they have surface densities and rotation curves with remarkable properties , represent disks of infinite extension and thus they are rather poor flat galaxy models .",
    "accordingly , in order to obtain more realistic models of flat galaxies , is better to consider methods that permit the obtention of finite thin disk models .    a simple method to obtain the surface density , the gravitational potential and the rotation curve of thin disks of finite radius was developed by @xcite . the hunter method is based in the obtention of solutions of laplace equation in terms of oblate spheroidal coordinates , which are ideally suited to the study of flat disks of finite extension . by superposition of solutions of laplace equation",
    ", expressions for the surface density of the disks , the gravitational potential and its rotational velocity can be obtained as series of elementary functions .",
    "the simplest example of a thin disk obtained by means of the hunter method is the well known kalnajs disk ( @xcite ) , which can also be obtained by flattening a uniformly rotating spheroid ( @xcite ) .",
    "the kalnajs disk have a well behaved surface density and represents a uniformly rotating disk , so that its circular velocity is proportional to the radius , and its stability properties have been extensively studied ( see , for instance , hunter ( @xcite ) , @xcite and @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we use the hunter method in order to obtain an infinite family of thin disks of finite radius .",
    "we particularize the hunter general model by considering a family of thin disks with a well behaved surface mass density .",
    "we will require that the surface density be a monotonically decreasing function of the radius , with a maximum at the center of the disk and vanishing at the edge , in such a way that the mass distribution of the higher members of the family be more concentrated at the center .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we present a summary of the hunter method used to obtain the thin disk models of finite radius and also we obtain the general expressions for the gravitational potential , the surface density and the circular velocity . in the next section , sec .",
    "3 , we present the particular family of models obtained by imposing the required behavior of the surface densities and then , in sec . 4 , we analyze its physical behavior . finally , in sec . 5",
    ", we summarize our main results .",
    "in order to obtain finite axially symmetric thin disk models , we need to find solutions of the laplace equation that represents the outer potential of a thin disklike source .",
    "according with this , we need to solve the laplace equation for an axially symmetric potential , @xmath0 where @xmath1 are the usual cylindrical coordinates .",
    "we will suppose that , besides the axial symmetry , the gravitational potential has symmetry of reflection with respect to the plane @xmath2 , @xmath3 so that the normal derivative of the potential , @xmath4 , satisfies the relation @xmath5 in agreement with the attractive character of the gravitational field .",
    "we also assume that @xmath6 do not vanishes on the plane @xmath7 , in order to have a thin distribution of matter that represents the disk .",
    "given a potential @xmath8 with the above properties , the density @xmath9 of the surface distribution of matter can be obtained using the gauss law ( @xcite ) .",
    "so , using the equation ( [ eq : con2 ] ) , we obtain @xmath10_{z = 0^{+}}.\\label{eq : sigma}\\ ] ] now , in order to have a surface density corresponding to a finite disklike distribution of matter , we impose the boundary conditions    @xmath11    so that the matter distribution is restricted to the disk @xmath7 , @xmath12 .",
    "we introduce now the oblate spheroidal coordinates , whose symmetry adapts in a natural way to the geometry of the model .",
    "this coordinates are related to the usual cylindrical coordinates by the relation ( @xcite ) ,    @xmath13    where @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the disk has the coordinates @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "on crossing the disk , @xmath18 changes sign but does not change in absolute value .",
    "this singular behavior of the coordinate @xmath18 implies that an even function of @xmath18 is a continuous function everywhere but has a discontinuous @xmath18 derivative at the disk",
    ".    in terms of the oblate spheroidal coordinates , the laplace equation can be written as @xmath19_{,\\xi } + [ ( 1 - \\eta^2 ) \\phi_{,\\eta}]_{,\\eta},\\ ] ] and we need to find solutions that be even functions of @xmath18 and with the boundary conditions    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is an even function which can be expanded in a series of legendre polynomials in the interval @xmath22 ( @xcite ) .    according with this , the newtonian gravitational potential for the exterior of a finite thin disk with an axially symmetric matter density",
    "can be written as ( @xcite ) , @xmath23 where @xmath24 are arbitrary constants , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the usual legendre polynomials and the legendre functions of second kind , respectively . with this general solution for the gravitational potential ,",
    "the surface matter density is given by @xmath27 and , as we will shown later , the arbitrary constants @xmath24 must be chosen properly so that the surface density presents a physically reasonable behavior .",
    "besides the matter density , another quantity commonly used to characterize galactic matter distributions is the circular velocity @xmath28 , also called the rotation curve , defined as the tangential velocity of the stars in circular orbits around the center .",
    "now , given @xmath29 , we can easily evaluate @xmath30 through the relation @xmath31_{z=0 } , \\label{eq:1.22}\\ ] ] in such a way that , by using ( [ eq : potencial ] ) , we obtain @xmath32 for the circular velocity .",
    "we will now particularize the above general model by considering a family of finite thin disk with a well behaved surface mass density .",
    "we will require that the surface density will be a monotonically decreasing function of the radius , with a maximum at the center of the disk and vanishing at the edge . in order to do this ,",
    "we impose the conditions @xmath33 and we also require that @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the total mass of the disk .    now , by using the boundary condition ( [ eq : bc1 ] ) , the surface density can be written in the form @xmath36 where @xmath37 is an even function of @xmath18 , monotonically increasing at the interval @xmath38 , and such that @xmath39 furthermore , we must to impose the condition @xmath40 in agreement with ( [ eq:4.12 ] ) .",
    "a simple function @xmath21 that agrees with all the above requirements was given by @xcite and can be written as @xmath41 where , in order to fulfill the condition ( [ eq : limit ] ) , we must take @xmath42 . with this particular choice of @xmath21",
    "we obtain an infinite family of finite disks with surface mass densities given by @xmath43^{m-1/2}. \\label{eq:4.20}\\ ] ] as we can easily see , the disk with @xmath44 corresponds to the well known kalnajs disk ( @xcite ) .",
    "accordingly , this family of finite thin disks can then be considered as a generalization of the kalnajs disk    now , from the equation ( [ eq:4.10 ] ) , the function @xmath21 can be written as @xmath45 with @xmath46 the coefficients @xmath47 are founded , by using the orthogonality property of the legendre polynomials , through the expression @xmath48 the above equation can be expressed as ( @xcite ) @xmath49,\\ ] ] so that , using the gamma function properties , we obtain : @xmath50,\\ ] ] for @xmath51 and @xmath52 for @xmath53 .",
    "with the above values of the @xmath24 we can compute the different physical quantities that characterize the behavior of the models .",
    "so , for instance , the gravitational potential of the first three members of the family are given by    @xmath54 , \\label{eq:4.22 }    \\\\",

    "now , is easy to see that , for all the members of the family , we will obtain finite values for these quantities .",
    "in particular , for the first member of the family , the potential at the disk is given by @xmath57 for @xmath58 , and this expression is completely equivalent to the corresponding expression in @xcite .    in the same way ,",
    "we obtain for the surface mass densities of the first three members of the family the expressions    @xmath59    and for the corresponding circular velocities the expressions    @xmath60    where has been introduced the dimensionless radial variable @xmath61 .    in order to graphically illustrate the behavior of the different particular models",
    ", we first introduce the dimensionless surface density of the disks , defined as @xmath62 for @xmath63 .",
    "so , in fig .",
    "[ fig : dens ] are depicted the dimensionless surface mass densities @xmath64 for the models corresponding to @xmath65 .",
    "as we can see , the disks with higher values of @xmath56 present a mass distribution that is more concentrated at the center and less at the edge .",
    "accordingly , these disks can then be considered as appropriated models of galaxies with a central bulb .",
    "now , in order to graphically illustrate the behavior of the circular velocities or rotation curves , we introduce the dimensionless quantity @xmath66 we plot , in fig .",
    "[ fig : vel1 ] the dimensionless rotation curves for the models corresponding to @xmath67 .",
    "the circular velcotiy corresponding to @xmath44 is proportional to the radius , representing thus a uniformly rotating disk . on the other hand , for @xmath68 , the circular velocity increases from a value of zero at the center of the disks , until it attain a maximum at a critical radius and then decreases to a finite value at the edge of the disk .",
    "also we can see that the value of the critical radius decreases as the value of @xmath56 increases .",
    "we presented an infinite family of axially symmetric thin disks of finite radius obtained by means of a particularization of the hunter method .",
    "the disk models so obtained are generalizations of the well known kalnajs disk , which corresponds to the first member of the family .",
    "the particularization of the hunter model was obtained by requiring that the surface density was a monotonically decreasing function of the radius , with a maximum at the center of the disk and vanishing at the edge , in such a way that the mass distribution of the higher members of the family were more concentrated at the center .",
    "we also analyzed the rotation curves of the models and we find for the first member of the family , the kalnajs disk , a circular velocity proportional to the radius , representing thus a uniformly rotating disk , whereas for the other members of the family the circular velocity increases from a value of zero at the center of the disks until reach a maximum at a critical radius and then decreases to a finite value at the edge of the disk .",
    "also we find that the value of the critical radius decreases as the value of @xmath56 increases .",
    "we believe that the obtained thin disk models have some remarkable properties and so they can be considered as appropriated realistic flat galaxy models , in particular if the superposition of these thin disks with appropriated halo distributions ( @xcite ) is considered .",
    "we are now considering some research in this direction .",
    "we are now also working in the non axially symmetric generalization of the here presented disks models and also in the obtention of the relativistic generalization of them for the axially symmetric case .",
