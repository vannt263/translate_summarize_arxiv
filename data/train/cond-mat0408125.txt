    "recently , physicists have displayed much interests in social phenomena that exhibit complex behaviors and nonlinear dynamics .",
    "a social network is a set of people with some pattern of contacts or interactions between them @xcite .",
    "the patterns of friendships between individuals @xcite , business relationships between corporations @xcite , and intermarriages between families @xcite are all examples of networks that have been studied in the past .",
    "hidden behind such complex phenomena , however , are many factors hard to control , including human nature , social environment , social distance and opportunity . fortunately , human beings have accumulated precious experiences of themselves .",
    "sociologists and psychologists have long noticed that the first impression between two individuals is often the seed of their future relationship , not only seen in romantic stories .",
    "good seed may promise good harvest , while ill seed may be supposed to portend illness .",
    "this effect seems to be more distinct in campus life , where the influence of social distances is not so remarkable .",
    "pupils of a class serve as a typical example that exhibits relatively simple friendships .",
    "see the studies of friendship networks of school children by rapoport @xcite . according to empirical observation ,",
    "students are more likely to get along with their friends in daily activities , such as dinner , discussion , entertainment , etc .",
    "often , their ties are strengthened through frequent contacts .",
    "assumably , people with common friends or common  enemies \" are prone to unite ; likewise , the  enemy \" of jack s friends or the friend of jack s  enemies \" may be very difficult to associate with jack .",
    "similar human relations and social environments are an effective catalyzer for friendships . as a result of restricted social scope and in the light of psychology , the encounters between  enemies \" in a class may also become quite frequent .",
    "you can not avoid your foes in such a small world .",
    "it might be an unfriendly eyesight , a provocative action or an unexpected quarrel , as commonplace in daily life . in the deepest of one s heart",
    "are always those he hates or he loves , while people without intensified contact are easy to fade from memory .    in this paper ,",
    "a simple model is proposed to study the mechanism of interpersonal relationships within a class .",
    "the small social world is assumed as an undirected and weighted graph , where students are represented by vertices , and the depth of favor or disfavor between two are denoted by the weight of corresponding edge .",
    "it must be stressed that this model is not restricted in pupil relations , but can be applied to other cases such as interpersonal relations in a club or a team .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "the model is described on the basis of some simplified assumptions ; to understand the mechanism better , we analyze the case for @xmath0=3 .",
    "next , experimental results of the weight distribution are presented and the first impression effect is discussed . in section 4 ,",
    "we conclude with some outlook and possible applications .",
    "the model system consists of @xmath0 individuals(students of a class ) . since the size of a class is not too large , it is suitable to assume that each student has chances to contact all his classmates . for clarity ,",
    "we introduce a generalization of the @xmath1 adjacency matrix to describe the interpersonal relationships of the small social network .",
    "the matrix elements @xmath2 represent the weight of edge @xmath3 , where @xmath4 , @xmath5=1 , 2 ,  , @xmath0 . postulate that the value of @xmath2 is discrete and can be negative for the case of disfavor relationships .",
    "if most elements of the matrix are positive , the system can be called harmonious ; otherwise , it contains considerable hostility . as an original model ,",
    "we add an assumption that each contact can only alter weight by @xmath6 at most . in other words ,",
    "love or hatred is not formed in a day ( or individuals will not fall in  love \" at first sight ) .",
    "this condition makes the contacts moderate and can be interpreted by the fact that true friends ( or enemies ) are selected by time .",
    "now , take @xmath0=5 for instance , the adjacency matrix is as below :    @xmath7for undirected and weighted graphs , @xmath8=0 and @xmath2=@xmath9 . in the following",
    ", we will only discuss the case of symmetric weights . since the @xmath4th row of the matrix records the information of interpersonal relationships of student @xmath4 , we will use it to judge the interpersonal similarity .",
    "this point is a basic assumption of our model and will be reviewed later . at the beginning of evolution",
    ", it is reasonable that some initial weights have non - zero values , due to first impressions among individuals . for convenience , we assign value 1 with probability @xmath10 , and @xmath11 with probability @xmath12 to the elements of matrix , i.e. the seed of the model is given . here ,",
    "@xmath10 is called _ the initial amity possibility_. the symmetry requirement of the matrix must be satisfied .",
    "the initial configuration and the evolution of the system are moderate in degree .",
    "the definition of the model is based on the weights dynamics :    ( i)first , suppose student @xmath4 has been randomly selected from the class . then , he takes the initial to contact student @xmath5 with a certain probability .",
    "a natural idea is to set this possibility as :    @xmath13    recalling the point that  in the deepest of one s heart are always those he hates or he loves , while people without intensified contact are easy to fade from memory\"(see introduction ) .",
    "however , this method may lead to the absurd case that individual @xmath5 with @xmath2=0 would not be chosen by @xmath4 , nor would @xmath4 by @xmath5 . therefore , the edges with 0 weight keep invariant , that is , unfamiliar ones are always unfamiliar . to avoid this unrealistic scenario , let @xmath4 choose @xmath5 with possibility :    @xmath14    obviously , @xmath15    the adaption is based on the moderate evolution mechanism : the minimum unit of weight is 1 , and each contact can only alter weight by @xmath6 at most . a non - zero value of @xmath16 is needed but we expect a least deflection to @xmath17 .",
    "when @xmath4 selects @xmath5 with possibility @xmath16 , for small @xmath18 this perturbation is quite significant and reasonable . in a fresh environment , people will try to get familiar with others and we call it unfamiliar - familiar period",
    ". the differences of weights are not significant ; thus , the contacts between them behave no obvious preferences .",
    "once some weight becomes 0 during the period , it is still possible to be altered in later contacts .",
    "initially , the interpersonal relations of the class are unsteady , and the first impressions rising in the period will play an important role in future weight polarization . when friends and enemies ( large @xmath18 ) form in the system , situation is quite different and we call it friend - enemy period . the contacts between friends and encounters between enemies now become more frequent , and the interpersonal relationships tend to be steady . however , the emergence of new friends and enemies is not forbidden .",
    "( ii)now , @xmath4 and @xmath5 have been chosen for interaction , then @xmath2 will be altered with a certain possibility :    @xmath19    the crux of the problem now is how to determine the possibility .",
    "recall that similar human relations and social environments are more likely to promote friendships .",
    "we could define @xmath20 as below to describe the interpersonal relation similarity :    @xmath21    where @xmath22it is manifest that @xmath20=@xmath23 and @xmath241 .",
    "one can see that the definition of @xmath20 is equivalent to the inner product of two normalized vectors .",
    "so @xmath20 could be regarded as a signed possibility . then in detail , the rules are : when @xmath250 @xmath26 with possibility @xmath20 , and nothing is altered with possibility @xmath27 ;    when @xmath280 @xmath29 with possibility @xmath30 , and nothing is altered with possibility @xmath31 .",
    "the mechanism ( ii ) have simple physical and realistic interpretations .",
    "take jack and mike for instance .",
    "if they have common friends or common enemies , they are more likely to strengthen their friendship ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "suppose , however , they are good fellows at first and jack s pals are all mike s foes .",
    "if jack goes on associating with mike , he may be excluded by some of his friends and have to confront his foes under certain circumstances .",
    "thus , their social relations have a potential to separate them ( @xmath33 ) , just like an electron - positron system under external electro - magnetic field . in this case",
    ", we can equally say that jack and mike have distinct social tastes and in the long run , their friendship is on test .",
    "after the weights have been updated , the process is iterated by randomly selecting a new individual for the next contact , i.e. going back to step ( i ) until the class disbands .    to better understand the micro dynamics ,",
    "it is beneficial to analyze the case for @xmath0=3 .",
    "suppose jack(a ) , mike(b ) and john(c ) interact with each other according to above mechanism .",
    "the possible states of this triangle - relation evolution are shown in fig .",
    "1 . triangle ( b ) represents the friend - friend - enemy relation , that is , two edges of the triangle have positive(+ ) weights and another is negative(@xmath34 ) .",
    "however , the common friend of antagonistic two will play a conciliatory role in the evolution , and thus , the negative weight will be neutralized at some point , given sufficient interacting time .",
    "review that the  enemy \" of jack s friends or the friend of jack s  enemies \" may be hard to associate with jack ( see introduction ) .",
    "on the basis of similar analysis , triangle ( c ) and ( d ) are expectantly the most possible stationary states in the evolution .",
    "the asymmetry of the micro mechanism will lead to the asymmetric weight distribution at the macro level .",
    "this point will prove itself in the next section .",

    "of the academic disciplines the social sciences have the longest history of the substantial quantitative study of real - world networks @xcite .",
    "of particular note among the early works on the subject are : jacob moreno s work in the 1920s and 30s on friendship patterns within small groups @xcite ; the so - called `` southern women study '' of davis et al .",
    "@xcite , which focused on the social circles of women in an unnamed city in the american south in 1936 ; the study by elton mayo and colleagues of social networks of factory workers in the late 1930s in chicago @xcite ; the studies of friendship networks of school children by rapoport and others @xcite ; and the mathematical models of anatol rapoport @xcite , who was one of the most theorists to stress the significance of the degree distribution in networks of all kinds , not just social networks . in more recent years ,",
    "studies of business communities @xcite and of patterns of sexual contacts @xcite have attracted particular attention .",
    "however , traditional social network studies often suffer from problems of inaccuracy , subjectivity , and small sample size .",
    "because of these problems many researchers have turned to other methods for probing social networks .",
    "one source of copious and relatively reliable data is collaboration networks @xcite ; another source of reliable data about personal connections between people is communication records of certain kinds @xcite .",
    "it is quite possible for researchers to investigate the ( weighted ) relationships in a certain class or club , for its finite size and simple patterns .",
    "previous researches had stressed the significance of the degree distribution in social networks , while more practical studies on the weighted social networks are required .",
    "recently , alain barrat , et al .",
    "have proposed a general model for the growth of weighted networks @xcite , considering the effect of the coupling between topology and weights dynamics .",
    "it appears that there is a need for a modelling approach to complex networks that goes beyond the purely topological point .",
    "the simple model here is self - generated and allows various further modifications .",
    "some acute interacting ingredients could be taken into this system .",
    "for instance , jack and mike might be intimate friends long before , so the initial weight between them must be larger . in the present model ,",
    "moreover , good friendship will not collapse instantly , nor will old grievance ; thus it seems more reasonable to take some acute interaction into account . in the framework of this model ,",
    "it is possible and interesting to study the adaptive process of a new student joining the class midway @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , this model could be easily extended to directed graph more close to real world where human relations are often asymmetric .",
    "finally , generalizing it to complex social , economic and political networks is also an interesting and challenging task .",
