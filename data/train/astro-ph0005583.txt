    "intermediate - age pre - main sequence ( pre - ms ) stars ( ages of @xmath2 myr ) with established distances and ages are rare in the astronomical literature ( @xcite ) . low - mass stars ( @xmath3 @xmath4 ) in this age range are predominantly past their active classical t tauri phase , and are usually called weak - lined t tauri stars ( wtts ) or post - t tauri stars ( @xcite ) .",
    "nearby stars ( @xmath5 pc ) in this age range are especially important for studies of stellar angular momentum evolution , stellar multiplicity , the evolution of young and luminous brown dwarfs and planets , and the evolution and longevity of circumstellar disks ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "it is particularly valuable to studies of these issues to have samples of nearby , coeval , codistant stars in this age range .",
    "coronal x - ray emission ( or more precisely , the ratio @xmath6 ) is elevated @xmath7 orders of magnitude above main sequence levels in low - mass stars throughout the pre - ms phase ( e.g. , @xcite ) . pointed x - ray observations of nearby active star - forming molecular clouds , where the bulk of the stars have modeled ages of @xmath82 myr , have identified many new weak - lined t tauri stars missed by previous surveys ( in chamaeleon i ( @xcite ) , taurus - auriga ( e.g. @xcite ) , and other active star - forming regions ) .",
    "copious numbers of older pre - ms stars have been found in star clusters such as the @xmath9 myr - old clusters ic 2602 and ic 2391 ( @xcite , @xcite ) , around the orion molecular clouds ( @xmath87 myr , @xcite ) and associated with gould s belt ( @xmath830 myr , @xcite ) .",
    "hundreds of isolated pre - ms and zams stars have been discovered with x - ray telescopes , particularly the @xmath10 all - sky survey ( rass , see reviews by @xcite and @xcite ) , and thus provides an excellent means for locating older wtt stars which may no longer be proximate to their parent molecular cloud .",
    "two stellar associations with x - ray - selected samples of wtts with ages around @xmath11 myr lie nearby : the sco ob2 ( sco - cen ) association at @xmath12 pc ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) and the tw hya t association at @xmath13 pc ( @xcite ) .",
    "last year , a new , nearby stellar aggregate was added to the list : the @xmath0 chamaeleontis cluster ( @xcite , hereafter paper i ) with age @xmath14 myr .",
    "the new cluster has @xmath15 = 97pc , and contains 13 known members with masses @xmath3 @xmath4 within a very small region ( 0.2 square degree ) of sky .",
    "the cluster was discovered with a _",
    "high resolution imager ( hri ) pointing of a tight group of 4 rass x - ray sources previously established to be wtts ( alcala et al .",
    "1995 , covino et al .",
    "the low - mass x - ray - discovered stars have the lithium and h@xmath16 spectral signatures of wtt stars and are clustered around several intermediate - mass stars including the @xmath17 = 5.5 b8v star @xmath0 cha , and the @xmath17 = 6 , a8v+a8v double - lined , eclipsing binary rs cha .",
    "paper i announced the group as the fourth nearest open cluster to the sun and the second nearest grouping of pre - ms stars after the tw hya association .",
    "since then , three additional candidate groups in the sun s neighborhood have been announced : the carina - vela group ( a possible extension of sco ob2 ; @xcite ) the `` tucanae association '' ( @xcite ) , a new association of @xmath1830-myr - old post - t tauri stars in horologium ( @xcite ) , and a small group of t tauri stars associated with the isolated mbm 12 cloud ( @xcite ) . as with the @xmath0 cha cluster , these new groups will require further study to piece together the recent star - formation history of the solar neighborhood , as well as investigate the dynamics of disintegrating star clusters ..    the present paper discusses the properties and origins of the @xmath0 cha cluster in detail .",
    "the x - ray data for cluster members is presented in section 2 .",
    "section 3 gives preliminary evidence for the existence of additional cluster members in the core region .",
    "section 4 compares the @xmath0 cha cluster to other open clusters . in section 5",
    ", we investigate the kinematics and origins of the @xmath0 cha cluster with respect to other young stars in the 4th galactic quadrant .",
    "we argue that the @xmath0 cha cluster , the sco - cen ob association , the tw hya association , and a group of young stars near @xmath1 cha , likely formed in or near the same giant molecular cloud complex @xmath19 myr ago .",
    "section 6 discusses the interstellar medium ( ism ) in the direction of the @xmath0 cha cluster and strengthens the claim for a kinematic origin in sco - cen .",
    "our findings are summarized in section 7 .",
    "appendix a details the kinematics of the @xmath0 cha cluster , the tw hya association , the @xmath1 cha group , and the sco - cen association .",
    "appendix b presents notes on individual @xmath0 cha cluster members .",
    "particular attention is paid to the eclipsing binary rs cha , which we find to be consistent with being two pre - ms a stars , but which has been modelled in previous literature as a non - coeval post - main sequence system .",
    "we observed the @xmath0 cha region with the hri ( @xcite ) on board the _ rosat _ satellite ( @xcite ) for about 12 hours in 32 segments spread over several months in 1997 .",
    "exposures were obtained during 4 satellite orbits over april @xmath20 , 14 orbits distributed between september 11 and october 8 , and during a more concentrated group of 17 orbits in october @xmath20 .",
    "these data were analyzed within the iraf / pros ( version 2.5.1 ) software system ( @xcite ) .",
    "the image received from the _ rosat _  standard analysis software system ( sass version 7 ) showed prominent sources , each showing identical structure distributed over 15 due to incorrect satellite aspect solutions . to alleviate this problem ,",
    "the images were divided into orbital intervals , centroids fitted to the brightest near - axis source , and the images aligned and merged ( @xcite ) .",
    "the reconstructed image , shown in figure [ fig_hri ] , is improved with residual distortions of a few arcseconds .",
    "about 1.5 hours of data were lost in this realignment process giving a net exposure of 41.7 ks .",
    "sources were located in the merged image with a cell detection algorithm within the iraf / pros software system , where square cells with sizes @xmath21 and @xmath22 are passed along the image to find peaks exceeding signal - to - noise ratio @xmath23 .",
    "this ratio is computed using poisson statistics after subtraction of a local background level and was confirmed manually using a global background level .",
    "the centroid positions of each peak was located with a likelihood ratio statistic .",
    "satellite boresight aspect errors frequently translate _ rosat _  images by several arcseconds .",
    "this was corrected by aligning eight strong x - ray source positions with their corresponding optical star positions , resulting in a good fit with boresight residuals in a range @xmath24 . with the exception of recx 12 where the right ascension is unreliable due to off - axis telescope coma , the statistical x - ray positional uncertainties are @xmath25 and the total uncertainties are about @xmath26 .",
    "the resulting 12 x - ray sources and their properties derived from the hri data are listed in table [ table_xray ] . following paper i ,",
    "these sources are denoted by their _",
    "rosat _  @xmath0 chamaeleon x - ray ( recx ) number . in columns 2 and 3 ,",
    "counts in the time - integrated image are measured in circles ranging from @xmath27 diameter , depending on the off - axis angle , after removal of a constant background value of 0.0638 counts per square arc second .",
    "uncertainties are based only on counting statistics .",
    "the effective exposure time is the detector live time of 41.7 ks corrected for location - dependent detector quantum efficiency variations , telescope vignetting , and point spread function scattering following sass procedures .",
    "this calculation is not optimized to achieve the high signal - to - noise ratio ; e.g. , the weakest source , recx 9 , shows @xmath28 in table [ table_xray ] but has @xmath29 when a smaller extraction circle is used .    in column 4 ,",
    "luminosities are estimated using a distance of 97 pc ( paper i ) and the conversion 1 countks@xmath30 = @xmath31 erg s@xmath30 @xmath32 in the @xmath33 kev band . derived from a convolution of raymond - smith thermal plasma source spectra with the telescope and instrument response functions using the w3pimms software ,",
    "this conversion is accurate to @xmath34 in log @xmath35for any combination of source temperatures @xmath36 kev and column densities @xmath37 @xmath32 .",
    "note that this @xmath35applies only to the @xmath33 kev band at the source , and not the luminosity emitted over all energies which can be substantially larger .",
    "stellar counterparts ( column 5 ) were sought from the simbad database , hubble space telescope guide star catalog ( version 1.2 ) , united states naval observatory pmm catalog ( usno - a2.0 ) , and the digitized sky survey ( dss ) .",

    "one additional source was found : a marginal x - ray source at the extreme northern edge of the image near the star gsc 9398_0105 with @xmath38=12.3 , @xmath39=11.6 .",
    "for its blue color , gsc 9398_0105 is a few magnitudes too faint to be a member of the cluster , and we do not assign it an recx number .",
    "the hri has a limited spectral response capable of providing a single hardness ratio within the @xmath33 kev band ( @xcite ) . due to spatial variations in the detector response and changes in the detector high voltage level made between segments of our observation",
    ", we do not attempt a quantitative analysis .",
    "but qualitative examination of the pulse height data shows a distinct trend .",
    "the brightest source , recx 1 , is also the hardest .",
    "sources with intermediate luminosities around log @xmath35@xmath43 erg s@xmath30 , have intermediate hardness ratios consistent with thermal emission in the range @xmath44 kev .",
    "the fainter sources with log @xmath35@xmath45 erg s@xmath30 have the softest spectra .",
    "this trend is seen in t tauri and other young star samples , and can be explained by relatively simple models of plasma heated by magnetic reconnection in loops near the stellar surface ( @xcite ) .    as the x - ray emission from young late - type stars",
    "is known to be highly variable due to flares and other manifestations of magnetic activity , the photon arrival times were examined .",
    "column 7 of table [ table_xray ] summarises the presence and degree of variability .",
    "`` yes '' indicates that the source is variable at a @xmath4699% confidence level using nonparametric one - sample kolmogorov - smirnov and von mises tests againsthe hypothesis of a constant source , `` possible '' indicates 90%@xmath4799% probability from one or both tests , and `` no '' indicates consistency with a constant count rate .",
    "the approximate minimum and maximum levels in hri counts ks@xmath30 seen in the light curves appear in parentheses .",
    "figure [ fig_xray ] shows the more dramatic changes seen in the seven variable sources .",
    "factors of @xmath48 jumps of flux on timescales ranging from 0.5 to @xmath462 days are seen .",
    "fluxes often exhibit a factor of @xmath49 range over the entire observation with peak luminosities between @xmath50 erg s@xmath30 .",
    "the light curves give the impression of individual powerful flares superposed on more moderately variable emission .",
    "the best - recorded event occurred in recx 8 (= rs cha ) and shows a decay timescale of @xmath180.5 days .",
    "while the x - ray properties of the @xmath0 cha stars are similar in most respects to those seen in other t tauri populations ( @xcite ) , the distribution of x - ray luminosities is quite unusual : there are too few stars with lower , but detectable , x - ray luminosities given the number of stars with high luminosities .",
    "the @xmath0 cha luminosity function is roughly flat between @xmath51 erg s@xmath30 , whereas source numbers are found to rise inversely with log @xmath35 in well - studied pre - ms and zams stellar clusters .",
    "consider , for comparison , the chamaeleon i young stellar cluster ( @xcite ) , @xmath16 per ( @xcite ) and the pleiades ( @xcite ) clusters . in these clusters , the number of x - ray sources in the range @xmath52 erg s@xmath30 in the _ rosat _ band is about twice the number of luminous sources with @xmath53 erg s@xmath30 .",

    ", a normal x - ray luminosity function predicts roughly 12 additional stars with @xmath60 erg s@xmath30 and about 16 stars with @xmath61 erg s@xmath30 .",
    "our hri survey was sensitive to stars at the distance of @xmath0 cha with @xmath62 .",
    "we surmise that a considerable number of low - mass stars with detectable x - ray luminosities reside outside the cluster core region surveyed by _ rosat _",
    "low - mass members of the cluster may have escaped after the dispersal of the proto - cluster molecular cloud .",
    "the molecular cloud core that formed the cluster stars was most likely dispersed by an external supernova or stellar winds , or possibly by the outflows and winds of the most massive cluster members .",
    "the discussion in  6 elaborates on what is known about the interstellar medium in the cluster vicinity , and points to the likely culprit being the massive stars in the sco - cen ob association .",
    "if the cluster stars formed with a small velocity dispersion of @xmath551 km @xmath63(as found in the cha i molecular cloud core ; @xcite ) , and the bulk of gas mass was dispersed , then the thermal motions of the stars will lead to the slow evaporation of the cluster .",
    "the escape velocity of the cluster , from summing the modeled masses of the 13 known systems within 15(0.4 pc ) radius of the center , is only @xmath64 km @xmath63(paper i ) .",
    "doubling the cluster mass , by finding unseen companions and possible x - ray faint / low - mass stars ( see  3.1 ) , would only increase @xmath65 by @xmath66 to @xmath670.7 km @xmath63 .",
    "numerical studies ( @xcite ) show that after a bound , embedded cluster ( n=50100 ) sheds its molecular cloud , the cluster can lose 10 - 80% of its stars , depending on the time scale for gas dispersal and the initial star - formation efficiency",
    ". if this scenario is correct , a `` halo '' of low - mass members within a few degrees of the @xmath0 cha cluster core ( 1@xmath68 = 1.7pc at @xmath15=97pc ) , should be present .",
    "in order to estimate the total population of the @xmath0 cha cluster , we extrapolate a typical imf assuming that we have a complete census of stars with masses above a certain mass threshold .",
    "we treat the membership of stellar primaries with masses @xmath461@xmath4 as complete since the stars would either be in the magnitude - limited _ hipparcos _ or tycho-2 catalogs .",
    "the tycho-2 catalog is 99% complete to @xmath69 ( @xcite ) , which is 0.5 mag fainter than the @xmath551.0@xmath4 k4 star recx 1 .",

    "a coarse extrapolation of a @xcite field mass function for a population with @xmath72 systems with @xmath731@xmath4 predicts a total membership of @xmath74 stellar primaries with masses greater than @xmath75 = 0.08 @xmath4 , the cannonical minimum stellar mass limit .",

    "the multiplicity statistics for the @xmath0 cha cluster stars await future study . assuming 1.5 stars per primary , typical for t tauri stars in the taurus clouds ( @xcite ) and young main sequence stars in the hyades ( @xcite ) , our imf extrapolation suggests a total population of @xmath76 stars .",
    "our current census includes 12 x - ray detected stars and the common proper motion a star hd 75505 , so we infer that perhaps @xmath77 additional _ primaries _ (",
    "i.e. systems ) await discovery .",
    "this extrapolation implies that our x - ray survey alone likely detected @xmath78 of the systems in the @xmath0 cha core region .",
    "did our x - ray survey miss a large number of `` x - ray faint '' wtts , or have some of the cluster members dispersed outside of the field of view of _ rosat _ hri field of view ?",

    "the ( @xmath83 )  colors were redder than what the recx spectral types ( paper i ) would predict , and the photographic magnitudes are coarse enough that we do not convert to the johnson colors in our discussion .",
    "although tied to the tycho _ bv _ photometry ( @xcite ) , the usno - a2.0 catalog is estimated to have absolute photometric uncertainties of @xmath85 mags and relative uncertainties around @xmath86 mag within a plate in the southern hemisphere .",

    "the feature was suggested to be the southern counterpart of the well - studied neutral hydrogen loop i ( or north polar spur ) by fejer & wesselius ( 1973 ) .",
    "this `` southern hemisphere low velocity filament '' has a mass of order 10@xmath129 @xmath4 and a distance around @xmath130pc estimated from stellar polarization studies ( @xcite , @xcite ) , similar to the _ hipparcos _ distance to lower centaurus crux ( 118pc ; z99 ) .",
    "the h i filament is clearly related to a long arc of cold dust in _ iras _  far - infrared maps , as shown in figure [ fig_iras ] .",
    "if one interprets it as a portion of a spherical shell , the center lies around @xmath131 or @xmath132 in the middle of the current location of the sco - cen lcc subgroup .",
    "de geus ( 1992 ) discusses this in the context of various interstellar shells and loops that surround the sco - cen ob association .",
    "the inner `` wall '' of the loop i bubble has been detected as an ism density jump @xmath133 pc away in the direction of sco - cen ( @xcite ) .",
    "putting these distances into a model of a spherical bubble centered on sco - cen places the @xmath0 cha cluster within the loop i bubble .",
    "the morphologies and distance estimates to these structure strongly suggest that past ob winds and supernova remnants from the most massive sco - cen stars evacuated a large volume within which the @xmath0 cha cluster now lies .",
    "this evacuation explains why there is very little molecular material currently present near @xmath0 cha , tw hya or the other stars likely originating in the sco - cen giant molecular cloud .",
    "the cloudlets found by mizuno et al .  ( 1999 ) may be molecular material that has not been fully dispersed or evaporated within the hot sco - cen supershell .",
    "the principal results of this study are :    \\(1 ) we have convincingly established that the group of x - ray selected stars around @xmath0 cha constitutes a physical open cluster , and not a chance superposition of unrelated stars .",
    "in addition to the arguments in paper i ( spatial coincidence of high- and low - mass stars ; identical distances and motions of the brighter stars from _ hipparcos _ measurements , and a self - consistent hr diagram ) , we find a compact cluster of photometric candidates coincident with the x - ray - discovered population (  3 , figure [ fig_sde ] ) . the @xmath0 cha cluster is smaller and more poorly populated than most classical open clusters (  4 , table [ table_lynga ] ) .",
    "its size and population is comparable to the small clusters seen in nearby stellar nursuries ( e.g. taurus , lupus , etc . ) , but the model ages are older ( @xmath558 myr ) and there is no associated molecular gas or dust .",
    "\\(2 ) the x - ray selected stars exhibit very high levels of magnetic activity , with powerful and high - amplitude x - ray variability ( table [ table_xray ] , figure [ fig_xray ] ) .",
    "this is supported by photometric evidence for large starspots on the stellar surfaces ( lawson et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "\\(3 ) the kinematics of the @xmath0 cha and other young stellar groupings over a large region of the southern sky indicate that many have a common origin about 10 - 15 myr ago during the star - formation epochs of the upper centaurus lupus and lower centaurus crux subgroups of the sco - cen ob association (  5 , table [ table_kine ] , figure [ fig_xyz ] ) .",
    "in particular , both the @xmath0 cha cluster and tw hya association appear to be outliers of the @xmath5511-myr - old lcc subgroup of the sco - cen association .",
    "we conclude that sco - cen is far larger than usually assumed ( e.g. @xcite , z99 ) , and that more young stars or groups of stars will be found with motions consistent with an origin in or near sco - cen .",
    "the presence of stellar groups like @xmath0 cha and tw hya lying today @xmath134 pc from the core of the sco - cen association can be readily understood as the consequence of their velocities inherited from the parent giant molecular cloud ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is well - established that , on large @xmath135 pc scales , giant molecular clouds exhibit velocity gradients and dispersions around 5 km @xmath63(@xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this high velocity dispersion is usually interpreted as the consequence of turbulence in cloud complexes .",
    "if the outlying stellar groups were unbound from the main ob association , they would have dispersed at a rate around 5 km @xmath63for 10 myr , which corresponds to their observed @xmath76 pc separations from the association today .",
    "the fate of the molecular material from which the @xmath0 cha stars formed is less certain .",
    "one possibility , mentioned by jones & herbig ( 1979 ) in another context , is that moving clouds experience resistance from the ambient medium and become separated from their newly formed stars on timescales of @xmath136 years .",
    "but the findings reviewed in  6 suggest that the @xmath0 cha cluster resided in a changing interstellar environment .",
    "initially , the cloud from which the cluster formed may have shared the stellar motion . at some later time the expanding stellar winds and/or supernova bubbles from the most massive sco - cen stars caught up to the cluster and evacuated or evaporated the @xmath0 cha cloud material .",
    "as the h i and dust filament is just a few degrees southwest of the cluster today ( figure [ fig_iras ] ) , this cloud - stripping may have occurred quite recently .",
    "if the star - formation efficiency of the @xmath0 cha cluster progenitor cloud was around @xmath11% , then the cloudlet was several hundred solar masses comparable to the cha i and ii clouds which are active today .",
    "it remains to be investigated astrophysically whether the sco - cen supernova remnants , now seen as the h i filament with @xmath137 @xmath4 could disperse a molecular cloud of this mass in the requisite time period .",
    "it is possible that the tiny molecular clouds found by mizuno et al .",
    "( 1999 ) throughout the chamaeleon region are left over from this dispersal process .    the kinematic tie between the @xmath0 cha , @xmath1 cha , and tw hya aggregates and the enormous sco - cen ob complex suggests that many of the young stars in the fourth galactic quadrant may have their origins in the sco - cen giant molecular cloud .",
    "the three young stellar groups discussed here  @xmath0 cha , @xmath1 cha , and tw hya  may be only a small fraction of a large population of @xmath123 myr pre - ms stars stars distributed in a `` halo '' around the main concentration of the sco - cen association .",
    "some of these pre - ms stars will lie very close to the sun .",
    "while study of the dynamical state and history of @xmath0 cha is beyond the scope of this paper , we can make some preliminary comments on this topic .",
    "the escape velocity from the cluster is likely to be about @xmath138 km s@xmath30 near the edge of the field that _ rosat _ hri surveyed",
    ". molecular clouds with several hundred masses of gas , a likely progenitor of the @xmath0 cha cluster , have internal three - dimensional velocity dispersions around @xmath139 km s@xmath30 ( @xcite ) .",
    "if stars inherit the velocity dispersions of their progenitor molecular clouds ( @xcite ) , then many stars may have escaped from the cluster , and the cluster core we study here may be evanescent .",
    "the dynamical history of the cluster is probably more complex than a simple loss of high velocity stars , as it depends on the rate of gas dissipation ( e.g. , slow thermal evaporation or sudden removal by supernova remnants ) .",
    "the role of binaries and possibility of mass segregation also should be studied ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "radial velocity measurements of more cluster members and n - body simulations are needed to address these questions with confidence .",
    "it would also be interesting to compare the dynamical evolution of @xmath0 cha with that of the tw hya association , which probably had a similar origin in the sco - cen giant molecular cloud but is now clearly unbound and dispersed .",
    "future kinematic simulations should also include the effects of galactic differential rotation , and the gravitational field of the disk in the z direction .",
    "the relative proximity of this cluster of stars , unobscured by molecular material , makes the @xmath0 cha cluster an ideal laboratory for studying aspects of the evolution of intermediate - aged pre - ms stars and substellar objects , such as angular momentum evolution along the hayashi tracks , stellar multiplicity , the luminous phases of brown dwarfs , and the evolution and longevity of circumstellar disks . at a distance of 97 pc and an age of @xmath1810 myr ,",
    "the low - mass stellar limit is defined by @xmath140 and spectral type m5  m6 .",
    "brown dwarfs with masses @xmath141 @xmath142 are relatively bright and hot objects with @xmath143 , @xmath144 k , and spectral types m6  m8 . these are more easily located and studied than the under - luminous @xmath145 k , l - type and t - type objects that characterize older brown dwarf populations ( @xcite ) .",
    "identification of additional cluster members can be provided by a combination of optical spectroscopy ( spectral typing and detection of key t tauri - star diagnostic lines such as h@xmath16 and li i @xmath1466707 ) , optical photometry and proper motion studies .",
    "the @xmath0 cha cluster may even be a suitable location for searching for the presence of early planet formation ; current @xmath147-m - class instruments already allow the resolution of sub - solar system - sized structures at @xmath148 100 pc .",

    "<S> the cluster has an anomalous x - ray luminosity function compared to other young clusters , deficient in stars with low , but detectable x - ray luminosities . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that many low - mass members have escaped the surveyed core region . </S>",
    "<S> photographic photometry from the usno - a2.0 catalog indicates that additional , x - ray - quiet members exist in the cluster core region . </S>",
    "<S> the components of the eclipsing binary rs cha , previously modeled in the literature as post - main sequence with discordant ages , are shown to be consistent with being coeval pre - ms stars .    </S>",
    "<S> we compute the galactic motion of the cluster from _ hipparcos _ data , and compare it to other young stars and associations in the fourth galactic quadrant . </S>",
    "<S> the kinematic study shows that the @xmath0 cha cluster , as well as members of the tw hya association and a new group near @xmath1 cha , probably originated near the giant molecular cloud complex that formed the two oldest subgroups of the sco - cen ob association roughly 10 - 15 myr ago . </S>",
    "<S> their dispersal is consistent with the velocity dispersions seen in giant molecular clouds . </S>",
    "<S> a large h i filament and dust lane located near @xmath0 cha has been identified as part of a superbubble formed by sco - cen ob winds and supernova remnants . </S>",
    "<S> the passage of the superbubble may have terminated star - formation in the @xmath0 cha cluster and dispersed its natal molecular gas . </S>"
