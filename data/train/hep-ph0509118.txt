    "one of the most important astrophysical challenges is to understand the nature and identity of dark matter .",
    "perhaps the most interesting candidate is a neutral , stable , weakly interacting particle arising from physics beyond the standard model .",
    "this is consistent with a wide range of data , such as measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation that imply the abundance of dark matter is roughly a factor of 6 times the abundance of baryons @xcite , as well as comparisons between large scale structure simulations and galaxy survey observations that suggest the bulk of dark matter is cold @xcite .",
    "universal extra dimension ( ued ) models @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , in which all of the standard model fields propagate in extra dimensions , provide an interesting example of kaluza - klein ( kk ) dark matter @xcite .",
    "this is because bulk interactions do not violate higher dimensional momentum conservation ( kk number ) , and in these models all of the couplings among the standard model particles arise from bulk interactions . to generate 4d chiral fermions , the extra compact dimension(s ) must be modded out by an orbifold . for five dimensions",
    "this is @xmath0 , while in six dimensions @xmath1 is suitable and has other interesting properties @xcite including motivation for three generations from anomaly cancellation @xcite and the prevention of fast proton decay @xcite .",
    "an orbifold does , however , lead to some of the less appealing aspects of the model .",
    "brane - localized terms can be added to both orbifold fixed points that violate kk number .",
    "if these brane localized terms are symmetric under the exchange of the two orbifold fixed points , then a remnant of kk number conservation remains , called kk parity .",
    "all odd - level kk modes are charged under this discrete symmetry thereby ensuring that the lightest level - one kk particle ( lkp ) does not decay .",
    "the stability of the lkp suggests it could well be an interesting dark matter candidate .",
    "we calculate the thermal relic abundance of dark matter including coannihilation with all level - one kk particles .",
    "this is an important calculation since there are many level - one kk particles that are near enough in mass to the lkp that they are expected to be important to determine the relic abundance .",
    "the identity of the lkp depends on the mass spectrum of the first kk level .",
    "we assume it is the lightest kk photon .",
    "this has been widely advocated for both its properties as dark matter and is favored by the contributions to the masses of the level one kk particles from one - loop radiative corrections @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of level - one kk particle masses is also not known . however",
    ", certain finite and log - enhanced one - loop radiative corrections @xcite to the masses have been calculated in @xcite .",
    "the size of these corrections depend on two unknowns : the size of the log , i.e. , the cutoff scale of the theory , and the size of the matching corrections evaluated at the cutoff scale .",
    "generically one would expect the calculable log - enhanced corrections to dominate over the uncalculable matching corrections .",
    "however , the log is not particularly large relative to the finite matching corrections .",
    "indeed , should the cutoff scale be close to the scale of the kk particle masses , uncalculable matching corrections would be of order the calculable log - enhanced corrections , and then one would like to know the relic abundance for a general spectrum .",
    "this is the calculation we carry out in this paper .",
    "we present our results with three scenarios of level - one kk particle mass spectra .",
    "first , we consider coannihilation with all level - one kk particles that carry electroweak , but not color charges .",
    "next , we consider coannihilation including colored particles . in both of these cases , we take all of the level one kk particles ( other than the lkp ) to have the same mass @xmath2 . finally , we consider coannihilation with all particles with a mass spectrum derived from the loop corrections from @xcite .",
    "we believe these three scenarios provide a good cross section of the effects of coannihilation",
    ". we also provide formulae for the ( co)annihilation cross sections so that any other more complicated spectra could easily be calculated based on our results .",
    "the format of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ kkgeneral ] we discuss kk dark matter including past results and motivate the need for the calculations we carry out . in sec .  [ freeze ] , we briefly describe the method used to calculate the relic abundance of the kk photon , and the effect of including coannihilating particles in this calculation . in sec .",
    "[ results ] , we consider the effect of coannihilation on the relic abundance , and use this to obtain limits on the mass of the corresponding dark matter candidate , the kk photon .",
    "we find mass ranges in three scenarios : ( 1 ) when electroweak kk excitations coannihilate , ( 2 ) when all kk excitations coannihilate , taking all kk particles ( except for the lkp ) to have the same mass , and ( 3 ) when all kk excitations coanihilate assuming the mass spectrum is determined by the one - loop radiative corrections in @xcite with zero matching corrections .",
    "appendices [ lagrangian ] and [ feynmanrules ] reviews the lagrangian and feynman rules in ued . the diagrams and cross sections pertinent to these results are summarized in appendices [ diagrams ] and [ crosssect ] .",
    "the relic density of the kk photon was first calculated by servant and tait @xcite .",
    "using their results , one finds that its thermal relic abundance of the kk photon matches the wmap observations for cold dark matter when the kk photon mass is between about 550 to 850 gev . the range of mass that they found depended on the relative importance of coannihilation with the level - one kk excitations of the right - handed leptons .",
    "this was the only coannihilation channel that was considered in @xcite .",
    "several groups have also examined the prospects for detecting kk dark matter directly and indirectly @xcite .",
    "coannihilation is likely to occur through other level one kk excitations . examining a typical spectrum of kk excitations from the one - loop radiative corrections discussed in @xcite ,",
    "one finds that the kk excitations of the particles transforming under the electroweak ( but not color ) groups tend to be within about 10% of the mass of the kk photon .",
    "this is near enough in mass that coannihilation with these kk excitations is expected to affect the the thermal relic abundance .",
    "we emphasize that these radiative corrections , proportional to the log of the ratio of the cutoff scale @xmath3 to the compactification scale @xmath4 , are merely indicative of shifts in the level one kk particle masses , since the finite matching corrections are unknown . indeed ,",
    "if the cutoff scale were not too large , even the kk excitations that transform under su(3)@xmath5 could also play an important role in the calculation of the thermal relic abundance .    what is the cutoff scale of ued models ?",
    "generically , the cutoff scale is where the extra dimensional theory gets strong . in the four dimensional effective theory",
    "this can be estimated by including kk excitations into loops , and one obtains typically @xmath6@xmath7 .",
    "but there have also been recent explicit scattering amplitude calculations that suggest the cutoff scale may be much lower than previously assumed @xcite . in any case , it is clear that including the effects of coannihilation for the entire spectrum will allow us to calculate the broadest range of kk photon masses that lead to a thermal relic abundance consistent with the cosmological measurements .",
    "we will illustrate the relative importance of different channels by showing the results for specific choices of the level one kk spectrum .",
    "the lower bound on the mass of the kk photon arises by calculating the effects of kk particles in loop corrections to precision electroweak data .",
    "this was first done by @xcite who found a lower bound of about @xmath8 gev .",
    "as we will see , this bound is not saturated no matter what spectrum of level one kk excitations one takes , and so we do not need to consider it further .",
    "in general , the accuracy we desire requires only tree - level calculations .",
    "however a very recent paper did find an important effect on the relic abundance of the kk photon @xcite .",
    "the loop suppressed operators on the orbifold fixed points lead to couplings between pairs of level - one excitations and sm particles through _ resonances _ of level two ( and higher ) kk excitations .",
    "the resonance behavior can roughly compensate for the loop suppression , resulting in a large contribution to the total cross section .",
    "@xcite investigated the effect of the annihilation @xmath9 through an @xmath10 channel @xmath11 , and found that including this process leads to a significant decrease in the relic abundance of @xmath12 . including these loop - suppressed effects",
    "would make our calculations prohibitively complicated , so in this paper we neglect them",
    ". instead , our motivation is orthogonal , namely to understand the implications of including coannihilation of all level one kk excitations on the relic abundance .",
    "ultimately , to obtain the most accurate estimate of the relic abundance of the kk photon would require taking into account both the resonance effect as well as the coannihilation effects that we report in this paper .",
    "we now briefly review the standard method for calculating the cosmological relic density of a stable particle @xcite .",
    "the number density of a particle in the expanding universe is described by the boltzmann equation @xmath13 \\label{boltzmann}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the thermal average of the total cross section for annihilation of the particle @xmath15 ( assumed here to be equal to the total cross section for producing @xmath15 ) times the relative velocity of two particles , and @xmath16 is the hubble expansion rate of the universe .",
    "we solve the boltzmann equation to obtain the number density of a massive particle at late times . at early times",
    "( @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) , @xmath19 is large , and any deviation of @xmath20 from @xmath21 rapidly goes to @xmath22 . at late times ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) , @xmath21 is tiny since the particles are now too massive to be thermally produced .",
    "as @xmath25 decreases due to the expansion of the universe , the particles eventually become too dilute to annihilate and freeze out at a constant density per comoving volume .",
    "this freeze - out occurs roughly when the hubble expansion rate overtakes the rate at which the particles annihilate , @xmath26 .",
    "as we will verify later , kk dark matter freezes out at @xmath27 , so that at freeze out @xmath28 , where @xmath29 , and @xmath30 is the number of degrees of freedom of the annihilating particle . in this case ,",
    "( [ boltzmann ] ) can not be solved analytically . instead , the boltzmann equation must be solved either numerically , or by means of a standard approximation which gives solutions consistent with numerical results to within @xmath31 . here",
    "we shall use the latter approach .    to solve the boltzmann equation approximately ,",
    "we begin by making a simplifying change of coordinates . if we assume the universe expands adiabatically , then @xmath32  constant , where @xmath10 is the comoving entropy density given by @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom . in terms of the variables",
    "@xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 , ( [ boltzmann ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath38\\ ] ] where we assume that freeze - out occurs in a radiation dominated epoch , so that @xmath39 .",
    "writing @xmath40 , this becomes @xmath41 where @xmath42 , and @xmath43 .    at early times , the particles track their equilibrium values , so that @xmath44 and @xmath45 . in this case",
    "@xmath46 to determine the freeze - out temperature , we use this expression for @xmath47 to solve @xmath48 with @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is a numerical factor whose optimal value is determined by comparison with numerical solutions of the boltzmann equation ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "the freeze - out temperature can be deduced by solving the following equation numerically : @xmath52    at late times , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are both small , and the equation reduces to @xmath55 this equation is separable , and can thus be solved ( with boundary conditions again chosen to give the best fit to numerical simulations ) : @xmath56 note that because of the factor of @xmath57 appearing in the numerator , this solution assumes that the universe expands adiabatically between freeze - out and today .",
    "this is , of course , not quite true , as some standard model particles will subsequently fall out of equilibrium , slightly increasing the entropy per comoving volume . in practice , however , this contribution from known standard model sources is very small , and hence may safely be neglected .",
    "different species of interacting particles that have masses nearly degenerate with the kk photon will fall out of equilibrium at the same time and with roughly similar density .",
    "interactions of the form @xmath58 ( where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the kk particles , and @xmath61 are sm particles ) , converting the relic into other particles of similar mass , occur rapidly .",
    "in fact , such processes are much more efficient than the relevant annihilation processes , so that the abundances of the all particles are effectively correlated during freeze - out .",
    "the slightly heavier particle species will eventually all decay to the lightest stable particle ( in our case , the kk photon ) and thus contribute to the relic density .",
    "this situation is called coannihilation .    as shown in @xcite , to compute the relic density and freeze - out temperature with coannihilation",
    ", it suffices to substitute an effective cross section @xmath62 for @xmath63 in eqs .",
    "( [ getomega]),([gett ] ) above , where @xmath64 the relic abundance depends on a weighted average of the annihilation and coannihilation cross sections of all relevant particles .",
    "thus if the coannihilating particles interact more strongly compared with the annihilating particles ( while also being close enough in mass ) they can increase the effective cross section and thereby decrease the relic density .",
    "conversely , if they are more weakly interacting , then the coannihilation effects decrease the effective cross section , yielding a larger final value for @xmath65 .    a simple intuitive picture of the effects of including coannihilation comes from noting that @xmath66 the integral over @xmath67 will of course result in a different weight for @xmath10 and @xmath68 wave annihilation , nevertheless it is easiest to simply ignore this difference and approximate @xmath69 . a larger effective cross section results in more annihilation during freeze - out , and thus a smaller relic density .    furthermore , it is easy to see that the effective cross section @xmath62 is a weighted average of the relevant annihilation and coannihilation cross sections by considering the case where all but the lightest ( first ) coannihilating particles have the same mass @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and all particles have the same number of degrees of freedom",
    ". then @xmath72 where @xmath73 run over all included particles , @xmath74 for the lkp ( all other kk particles ) , and @xmath75 is the total ( co)annihilation cross section for the process @xmath76 standard model particles .",
    "this makes it clear that in the limit of a small mass difference and equal numbers of degrees of freedom , @xmath62 is precisely the average of all relevant cross sections while the relic abundance depends only on whether this average is larger or smaller than @xmath77 . if all @xmath75 are equal , then including coannihilation does not alter the relic density ; if the weighted cross sections of the coannihilating particles are on average larger ( smaller ) than that of the original particle , then the relic density will be smaller ( larger ) when coannihilation is included .",
    "this holds irrespective of the value of @xmath78 .",
    "however , since @xmath78 enters exponentially into the weights of the coannihilation cross sections , the effects of coannihilation are rapidly suppressed as the relative mass difference @xmath78 increases . typically for weakly interacting particle",
    "dark matter , @xmath79 to @xmath80 , and for @xmath81 the effects of coannihilation are generally negligible .",
    "however , for very large coannihilating cross sections , fractional mass differences up to @xmath82 can affect the relic density @xcite .",
    "now we are ready to consider the effect of coannihilation on the relic abundance of the the kk photon .",
    "each coannihilation scenario considered requires several total annihilation cross sections ; the relevant feynman diagrams , together with tables of the formulae of the relevant cross sections , are presented in appendices [ diagrams ] and [ crosssect ] .",
    "certain approximations were made in obtaining our results .",
    "cross sections were computed ignoring all terms of order @xmath83 where @xmath84 is any standard model mass .",
    "consequently , we ignored all yukawa couplings which are proportional to the corresponding fermion mass .",
    "this approximation is well justified ( in that including such terms should alter the relic abundance by less than @xmath85 ) for all particles except possibly the top quark , whose mass @xmath86 gev is close to one half of the precision electroweak lower bound on @xmath4 . in particular , as shown in @xcite , the top yukawa coupling can alter the cross section significantly , as it leads to nearly resonant @xmath10-channel diagrams . aside from this effect",
    ", our results are not expected to be sensitive to the top mass since , as we will see , the masses of the kk photon necessary to explain the observed relic dark matter abundance are well above the mass of the top quark .",
    "it addition , we neglected the mixing between @xmath87 and @xmath88 , which are expected to be rather small already for the first kk level ( see appendix [ kweins ] ) .",
    "hence , we take @xmath89 , @xmath90 throughout .    when examining the relic density as a function of mass ,",
    "a further simplification is obtained by ignoring the mass - dependence of @xmath91 .",
    "the value of @xmath91 depends very weakly on the mass .",
    "indeed , from ( [ gett ] ) we expect this dependence to be approximately logarithmic .",
    "typically , over the mass range of @xmath92 to @xmath93 tev , @xmath91 varies by about @xmath93 gev / degree , or less than 10% . on the relative masses of the coannihilating particles , however , has a somewhat larger effect , and have been taken into account . ]",
    "this variation has a small effect on the relic density .",
    "this also shows that the kk dark matter is cold : for all cases considered here , we find @xmath94 , so that the particles are well approximated as non - relativistic .",
    "we use couplings and astrophysical parameters that can be obtained from @xcite .",
    "in particular , we take the electroweak and strong couplings evaluated at @xmath95 ( ignoring the renormalization group running of the couplings ) . in practice , the freeze - out temperature is between about @xmath96 and @xmath7 gev , depending on which particles coannihilate .",
    "the dark matter relic density is taken to be the @xmath97 value from wmap , @xmath98 @xcite .      to investigate the effects of kk particles coannihilating with the kk photon , we chose two different mass spectra for the coannihilating particles .",
    "first , particles in the first kk level are divided into two groups : those with masses approximately @xmath99 , with @xmath78 small , and those that are too heavy to play a role in coannihilation . while this choice of mass spectrum gives a good understanding of the range of possible outcomes of including coannihilating particles , it is also somewhat arbitrary .",
    "thus , we also investigate a mass spectrum based on that derived in @xcite in the next subsection .",
    "the first check on our results was to consider coannihilation of the kk photon with just right - handed leptons , where our calculations and numerical results agree with @xcite .",
    "this provides a non - trivial check on our procedure for calculating the relic density in the universal extra dimensions model .",
    "figure [ allew ] shows the effect of including coannihilation of the kk photon with leptons ( blue ) , and all electroweak particles including leptons , scalars , and electroweak gauge bosons ( red ) .",
    "here we assume in each case that particles included in the coannihilation have the same mass @xmath100 .",
    "the graph shows that coannihilation with leptons , and to a lesser extent with @xmath101 and @xmath102 bosons , tends to increase the relic density for a given mass of the kk photon .",
    "figure [ allew2 ] shows the effect of including coannihilation of the kk photon with all level one kk electroweak particles and level one kk quarks ( blue ) , and all particles at kk level one including the kk gluon ( red ) .",
    "again , we assume in each case that all particles included in the coannihilation have the same mass @xmath100 . clearly , including coannihilation with strongly interacting kk particles decreases the relic abundance for a fixed kk photon mass .",
    "the extent of this decrease is one of the most important results of this paper . in particular ,",
    "if the level one kk particles are highly degenerate to within a few to perhaps 10% , the kk photon mass consistent with the thermal relic abundance that matches the wmap data could be several tev .     with all leptons ( blue ; left - most pair of solid and dashed lines ) , and all electroweak particles ( red ; middle pair of solid and dashed lines ) , assuming in each case that all coannihilating particles have the same mass @xmath103 .",
    "the solid ( dashed ) lines show the values for @xmath104 @xmath105 for the cases with coannihilation .",
    "notice that for the case including kk electroweak gauge bosons , the abundance as a function of mass is smaller for the smaller mass splitting @xmath104 , unlike the case with just kk leptons , since the effects of coannihilation of these two sets of kk particles somewhat compensate for each other in the relic abundance calculation . ]     with all non - strongly interacting particles _ and _ quarks ( blue ) , and all level one particles ( red ) assuming in each case that all coannihilating particles have the same mass @xmath2 .",
    "the solid and dashed lines show the values for @xmath104 , and @xmath106 . ]",
    "tev , @xmath107 , and all couplings taken at the scale @xmath95 .",
    "here each color represents a particular particle species ( see legend ) , and the x - axis indicates with which particle the ( co)annihilation is occurring .",
    "for example , a blue dot above the text @xmath108 is the coannihilation cross section of @xmath109 with @xmath108 .",
    "only 2 families of fermions are shown , as this is sufficient to show the difference between annihilation between members of the same family , and coannihilation between members of different families .",
    "the annihilation cross sections for fermions , @xmath101 and its scalar counterpart @xmath110 have been weighted by a factor of @xmath111 to account for the two helicities .",
    "in general the coannihilation cross sections are smaller than the annihilation ones , ( and more numerous ) so that usually adding more coannihilating particles decreases the effective cross section .",
    "however , as the su(2 ) coupling is stronger than the u(1 ) coupling , and as it also opens more channels , when scalars and gauge bosons , whose annihilation cross sections are quite large , are added , the average cross section increases . ]    these results can be more readily understood by examining the relative magnitudes of the cross sections in question , shown in in fig .",
    "[ ewcrosssections ] . notice first that the coannihilation cross section of any non - colored particle with @xmath87 is smaller than the annihilation cross section of @xmath87 with itself .",
    "thus coannihilation with particles whose self - annihilation cross sections are close to those of @xmath87 tends to decrease the effective cross section , and hence increase the relic abundance for a given @xmath87 mass .",
    "this is the case for leptons and scalars . the level one kk electroweak gauge bosons @xmath112 and @xmath113 and all strongly interacting particles have sufficiently large self - annihilation cross sections that they cause an increase in the effective cross section , and decrease the relic abundance . for @xmath112 and @xmath113",
    "this effect is relatively small , and their inclusion does not completely counter - balance the reduction in @xmath114 resulting from including leptons and scalars . in the case of the strongly interacting particles ,",
    "the relevant cross sections are approximately an order of magnitude larger than those of the non - strongly interacting particles , and the resulting reduction in the relic density is quite dramatic at small @xmath78 .      in this section",
    "we consider the spectrum that results if one takes the one - loop radiative corrections to the kk masses from @xcite .",
    "there are several assumptions built into this spectrum .",
    "one is that the matching contributions to the brane - localized kinetic terms are assumed to be zero when evaluated at the cutoff scale .",
    "furthermore , the radiatively generated terms are log enhanced by a log of the ratio of the cutoff scale @xmath3 to the mass of the kk excitation .",
    "this ratio is also not known , and may be much smaller than previously estimated @xcite . we therefore consider a wide range of @xmath115 to illustrate the effects of coannihilation .",
    "first , let us summarize the results of @xcite that are used for the masses of the kk excitations in this section : @xmath116 all of the non - colored kk excitation masses are within about 10% of @xmath117 up to moderately high values of the cutoff scale ( @xmath118 ) , and hence are almost certainly relevant for coannihilation .",
    "conversely , for @xmath119 , the masses of the strongly interacting particles are more than @xmath85 greater than @xmath117 , and thus are less likely to be important for coannihilation .",
    "however , as emphasized by @xcite , particles with sufficiently large cross sections may be relevant to coannihilation even for mass differences of up to of order @xmath120 .",
    "we further simplify the mass spectrum given by ( [ masscorr ] ) , while ignoring the sm top quark mass , by dividing the kk particles into five mass classes : the kk photon ; the kk leptons and scalars ; the kk @xmath101 and @xmath102 gauge bosons ; the kk quarks ; and the kk gluon .",
    "( in cases with more than one particle of slightly differing mass , we take the average mass of all of the particles in that class . )",
    "figure [ adsmass ] shows the @xmath12 mass that results in a thermal relic abundance consistent with cosmological data , as a function of @xmath115 , given a five class mass spectrum .",
    "the upper plot also shows the mass gap @xmath78 for each of the classes . because @xmath121 is considerably larger than @xmath122 , the masses of the strongly interacting particles increase rather quickly as the cutoff increases . for @xmath123 , nearly all strongly interacting particles",
    "have @xmath124 .",
    "masses of the leptons and scalars , however , vary rather slowly with @xmath115 , and remain within @xmath85 of the @xmath12 mass out to values @xmath125 .",
    "thus as the cutoff is increased , the gluons , quarks , and to a lesser extent the @xmath101 and @xmath102 bosons , rapidly become too heavy to play a role in coannihilation , and the relic density is determined by the effective cross section of @xmath12 and the kk leptons and scalars .",
    "thus the mass spectrum , eq .  ( [ masscorr ] ) , favors a somewhat lower value of @xmath126 gev to be consistent with the measurements of the dark matter abundance in the universe .",
    "mass yielding a thermal relic abundance consistent with wmap observations is shown in the bottom graph using as a function of @xmath115 .",
    "this result was calculated using a simplified spectrum of the first kk level consisting of four sub - levels that vary logarithmically with @xmath115 , shown in the top graph .",
    "the ratios are from top to bottom : the kk gluon , the kk quarks , the kk electroweak gauge bosons , and the kk leptons and scalars , divided by the kk photon mass . the black dashed line corresponds to @xmath106 for reference . in the bottom graph , including increasing numbers of particles at the first kk level are shown with the four lines labeled in the legend .",
    "the solid straight black line ( the line at the top on the far right ) shows the the case without coannihilation for reference .",
    "all level one kk particles except for the leptons and scalars become rapidly irrelevant to the relic abundance calculation once @xmath127 . ]",
    "we have calculated the thermal relic abundance of the kk photon in the five dimensional ued model for a generalized mass spectrum of level one kk particles .",
    "we find that the lowest kk photon mass which could possibly account for the observed dark matter relic abundance is @xmath128 gev , resulting from including coannihilation with three generations @xmath129 and neutrinos all very nearly degenerate with @xmath12 ( @xmath130 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the result found in ref .",
    "@xcite updated to reflect the wmap measurements .",
    "since the radiative mass corrections should be the same for @xmath108 and @xmath131 , a more realistic estimate , given by including all kk leptons , is @xmath132 gev .",
    "this is significantly lower than the lower mass bound of @xmath133 gev given by including @xmath12 alone . including level one kk quarks and the kk gluon with masses within about 10% of the mass of the kk photon significantly increases the total effective annihilation cross section .",
    "this implies the kk photon mass leading to a thermal relic abundance consistent with wmap observations is much larger , up to several tev , see figs .",
    "[ allew2 ] and [ adsmass ] for more precise numerical ranges . on face value",
    ", such a small separation between the kk photon and the strongly interacting level one kk particles is not expected from the radiative corrections to the masses of the first kk level computed in @xcite . however , if the cutoff scale is not much larger than the kk photon mass itself , and thus matching corrections are comparable in size while opposite in sign to compensate , the level one kk spectrum could be much more degenerate .",
    "these results show that the range of the kk photon mass is much wider if indeed the mass spectrum is more degenerate than previously thought . given measurements of the level one kk particle masses , the calculations presented here could be used to find the total effective cross section to verify if the kk photon does ( or does not ) make up the dark matter density needed to be consistent with wmap observations .",

    "<S> in universal extra dimension models , the lightest kaluza - klein ( kk ) particle is generically the first kk excitation of the photon and can be stable , serving as particle dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the thermal relic abundance of the kk photon for a general mass spectrum of kk excitations including full coannihilation effects with all ( level one ) kk excitations . </S>",
    "<S> we find that including coannihilation can significantly change the relic abundance when the coannihilating particles are within about 20% of the mass of the kk photon . </S>",
    "<S> matching the relic abundance with cosmological data , we find the mass range of the kk photon is much wider than previously found , up to about 2 tev if the masses of the strongly interacting level one kk particles are within five percent of the mass of the kk photon . </S>",
    "<S> we also find cases where several coannihilation channels compete ( constructively and destructively ) with one another . </S>",
    "<S> the lower bound on the kk photon mass , about 540 gev when just right - handed kk leptons coannihilate with the kk photon , relaxes upward by several hundred gev when coannihilation with electroweak kk gauge bosons of the same mass is included .    </S>",
