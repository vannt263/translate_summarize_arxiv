    "quantum entanglement is endowed with certain curious features . unlike classical correlations , quantum entanglement can not be freely shared among many quantum systems . it has been observed that a quantum system being entangled with another one limits its possible entanglement with a third system . this has been dubbed the `` monogamous nature of entanglement '' which was first proposed by bennett@xcite . if a pair of two - level quantum systems @xmath0 and @xmath1 have a perfect quantum correlation , namely , if they are in a maximally entangled state @xmath2 , then the system @xmath0 can not be entangled to a third system @xmath3 .",
    "this indicates that there is a limitation in the distribution of entanglement , and several efforts have been devoted to capture this unique property of `` monogamy of quantum entanglement '' in a quantitative way for tripartite and multipartite systems@xcite .",
    "another distinctive property of quantum entanglement for multipartite systems is the possibility of entanglement swapping between two or more pairs of qubits .",
    "using this property , two parties that never interacted in their history can be entangled@xcite .",
    "there may indeed exist a deeper connection between the characteristics of `` monogamy '' and entanglement swapping since the features of the distribution and transfer of quantum information is essentially reflected in the both these properties .",
    "practical realization of various features of quantum entanglement are obtained in atom - photon interactions in optical and microwave cavities@xcite .",
    "recently , some studies have been performed to quantify the entanglement obtained between atoms through atom - photon interactions in cavities@xcite .",
    "an important attribute of real devices in the ubiquitous presence of dissipative effects in them .",
    "these have to be monitored in order for the effects of quantum correlations to survive till detection .",
    "the consequences of cavity leakage on information transfer in the micromaser has been quantified recently@xcite .",
    "it is natural to expect the other characteristics of entanglement such as its `` monogamous '' nature , and also its exchange or swapping to be affected by dissipative processes .",
    "atom - photon interactions in cavities are a sound arena for the quantitative investigations of different aspects of quantum entanglement in realistic situations .    with the above motivation",
    "we perform a quantitative study of the mono - gamy of quantum entanglement and its swapping in dissipative atom - photon interactions in microwave cavities .",
    "we focus on a system of two entangled single - mode cavities which are empty initially .",
    "we then consider the passage of a two - level atom through either or both of them . in the next section we first consider a tripartite pure system ( two ideal cavities and one atom ) and study the features of `` monogamy '' exhibited between the atom - cavity and the cavity - cavity entanglements .",
    "in particular , we demonstrate the applicability of the coffman - kundu - wootters ( ckw)@xcite `` monogamy '' inequality to this system . we next consider a realistic cavity with photon leakage , and repeat the above analysis keeping in mind the recently conjectured validity of the ckw inequality extended for mixed states@xcite .",
    "we find that cavity dissipation could lead to interesting possibilities , such as the enhancement of the entanglement between the atom and the cavity mode that it interacts with , a feature that could be understood by the `` monogamous '' behaviour of entanglement . in section",
    "iv we consider a four - qubit system ( two cavities and two atoms ) where our goal is to observe entanglement swapping , or the transfer of entanglement from the initially entangled two cavities to the two atoms . here again , we first perform the analysis with ideal cavities , and then consider the effects of cavity leakage on entanglement swapping .",
    "we present some concluding remarks in section v.",
    "we first consider two ideal cavities which can be maximally entangled by sending a single circular rydberg atom prepared in the exited state through two identical and initially empty high - q cavities ( @xmath4 and @xmath5)@xcite .",
    "the initial state of the two - cavity entangled system can be written as @xmath6 where the index 1 and 2 refer to the first and second cavity , respectively . in this",
    "set - up we consider the passage of a two - level rydberg atom @xmath7 prepared in the ground state @xmath8 through the cavity @xmath4 .",
    "we are considering the resonant interaction between the two - level atom and cavity mode frequency .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian in the rotating frame approximation for the atom - cavity system is @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are usual creation and destruction operators of the radiation field and @xmath12 are atomic operators analogous to the pauli spin raising and lowering operators obeying the commutation relation @xmath13=2{\\sigma}_z$ ] , where @xmath14 represents the atom in the upper ( lower ) state .",
    "@xmath15 is the atom - field interaction constant ( or @xmath16 the rabi angle ) .",
    "the dynamics of the atom - photon interaction is governed by the equation @xmath17\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with joint three - party initial ( @xmath18 ) state corresponding to @xmath19 hence , a two - level atom entering the empty cavity in the upper state ( @xmath20 ) evolves to @xmath21 at some time @xmath22 , and similarly , a two - level rydberg atom entering the one photon cavity in the ground state evolves to @xmath23    0.4 cm    , width=302 ]    [ f1 ]    for any interaction time @xmath22 the evolved state is given by @xmath24 @xmath25    the reduced density states of the pairs @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 are given by @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31 we now compute the mixed - state bipartite entanglement measure ( concurrence)@xcite for different pairs .",
    "these are given by @xmath32 and are plotted in figure2 for varying rabi angle , clearly reflecting the monogamous nature of entanglement between @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "0.2 in     ( solid line ) , @xmath33 , ( dotted line ) , @xmath34 ( broken line ) plotted with respect to the rabi angle @xmath16.,width=226 ]    [ f2 ]    0.2 in    the ckw inequality@xcite for the tripartite pure state @xmath35 : + @xmath36 + reduces to @xmath37 in this case .",
    "let us now investigate the above case in presence of the cavity dissipation . since the lifetime of a two - level rydberg atom is usually much longer compared to the atom - cavity interaction time , we can safely neglect the atomic dissipation .",
    "the dynamics of the flight of the atom is governed by the evolution equation @xmath38 where the strength of the couplings are given by the parameters @xmath39 ( the cavity leakage constant ) and @xmath15 ( the atom - field interaction constant ) . at temperature @xmath40 the average thermal photon number is zero , and hence one has@xcite @xmath41 when @xmath42 , it is possible to make a secular approximation@xcite while solving the complete evolution equation by combining eqs.(3 ) and ( 16 ) in order to get the density elements of @xmath43 .",
    "we also work under a further approximation ( that is justified when the cavity is close to @xmath44 ) that the probability of getting two or more photons inside the cavities is zero , or in other words , a cavity always remains in the two level state comprising of @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the tripartite ( mixed ) state is then obtained to be @xmath47 where the @xmath48 are given by @xmath49 @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the leakage constants for cavity @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively .",
    "the reduced density states of the pairs @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 are thus given by @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 and one can obtain the respective concurrences .",
    "these , namely , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath33 are plotted with respect to the rabi angle @xmath16 in figure3 .",
    "as expected , dissipation reduces the respective concurrences",
    ". however , the `` monogamous '' character , or the ` complementarity ' between @xmath55 and @xmath33 is maintained even with cavity leakage .",
    "0.5 cm     ( solid line ) , @xmath33 , ( dotted line ) , @xmath56 ( broken line ) plotted with respect to the rabi angle @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath57.,width=302 ]    [ f3 ]    0.2 in    to verify the ckw inequality for the mixed state @xmath43 , one has to average @xmath58 over all pure state decompositions@xcite .",
    "we however , adopt an utilitarian point of view , and for small @xmath39 take @xmath59 .",
    "note that this result holds exactly for a pure state@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , for a small value of @xmath39 and for a bipartite photon field , one stays very close to a pure state . in figure4",
    "we plot the left and the right hand sides ( @xmath60 and @xmath61 respectively ) , of the corresponding ckw inequality and observe that it always holds under the above approximation .    0.3 in     ( solid line ) ,",
    "@xmath62 ( dotted line ) plotted with respect to the rabi angle @xmath16.,width=302 ]    [ f4 ]    0.2 in    an interesting feature of the entanglement obtained between the atom @xmath63 and the cavity @xmath64 through which it interacts directly is displayed in figure5 where @xmath65 is plotted versus the dissipation parameter @xmath39 .",
    "note that the concurrence increases for increasing cavity loss .",
    "this happens because the cavity leakage reduces the intial entanglement between @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and hence makes room for the subsequent entanglement between @xmath4 and @xmath7 to form .",
    "the dissipative mechanism is thus a striking confirmation of the `` monogamous '' character of entanglement .",
    "the role of the dissipative environment in creating desired forms of entanglement has been revealed earlier in the literature@xcite .",
    "the present case can be also viewed as a further example of this kind .",

    "in this section we will consider a few aspects of entanglement swapping or the transfer of entanglement from the two - cavity to the two - atom system .",
    "such a scheme can be affected by sending two rydberg atoms @xmath7 , @xmath71 prepared in their ground states @xmath72 , @xmath73 through two maximally entangled cavities @xmath4 , @xmath5 respectively .",
    "the time of flights for the atoms through the cavities are same .",
    "so at @xmath18 , the state of the total system is",
    "@xmath74    0.2 in    , @xmath71 prepared in the ground states @xmath72 , @xmath73 through two maximally entangled cavities @xmath4 , @xmath5 respectively.,width=302 ]    [ f6 ]    0.2 in    for any interaction time @xmath22 the evolved state is @xmath75 @xmath76 the reduced density states of the pairs @xmath26 , @xmath77 are given by @xmath78 @xmath79 @xmath80    0.2 in     ( solid line ) , @xmath81 , ( dotted line ) plotted with respect to the rabi angle @xmath16.,width=226 ]    [ f7 ]    0.2 in    the concurrences for the pairs @xmath4-@xmath5 and @xmath7-@xmath71 are plotted in the figure7 .",
    "one sees that the entanglement between two cavities are swapped by two atoms for the interaction times @xmath82 , ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "finally , we consider the effect of cavity leakage on the transfer of information from the two - cavity to the two - atom system . under the secular approximation@xcite and the approximation of a two - level cavity",
    ", one can solve the master equation to obtain the four - party density matrix which can be formally expressed as @xmath84 where the @xmath48 are given by @xmath85 apart from the above eight terms no other term contributes to either of the reduced density states @xmath86 or @xmath87 , which are given by @xmath88 @xmath89 0.2 in     ( solid line ) , @xmath81 , ( dotted line ) plotted with respect to the rabi angle @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath90,width=302 ]    [ f8 ]    0.2 in    though the concurrences @xmath55 and @xmath81 are reduced by the loss of cavity photons , one sees from figure8 that perfect swapping is still obtained for @xmath82 .",
    "one of the basic features of information exchange between bipartite systems , represented by entanglement swapping , is thus seen to be preserved for mixed states too .",
    "in this paper we have considered two important and interesting features of quantum entanglement , viz .",
    ", `` monogamy '' , and entanglement swapping .",
    "we have used the set - up of two initialy entangled cavites@xcite and a single rydberg atom passing through one of them to study the quantitative manifestation of a `` monogamy '' inequality@xcite in atom - photon interactions .",
    "the unavoidable photon leakage exists in all real cavities used for the practical realization of quantum information transfer .",
    "the effects of such dissipation have been investigated on the `` monogamous '' nature of the entanglement between the two cavities , on one hand , and the atom and the second cavity on the other .",
    "we have found that the essential `` monogamous '' character is preserved even with cavity dissipation .",
    "we have further seen that the entanglement between the atom and the cavity through which it passes increases with larger dissipation , a feature that could be understood by invoking the `` monogamous '' character of entanglement .",
    "we have then considered a set - up involving two entangled cavities , and two rydberg atoms .",
    "entanglement swapping from the two cavities by the two atoms which never interact directly with each other is observed in this system",
    ". cavity dissipation , of course reduces the total amount of information exchange , similar to the results obtained in the context of the single - atom micromaser@xcite .",
    "moreover , here we have verified that the property of swapping is preserved with dissipation .",
    "further studies on different quantitative manifestations of information transfer in the presence of dissipative effects might be useful for the construction of realistic devices implementing various protocols .",
