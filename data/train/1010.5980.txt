    "back in the eighties , quark bag models were proposed as models for hadrons that capture the essentials of asymptotic freedom through weakly interacting quarks and gluons within a bag , and the tenets of nuclear physics through strongly interacting mesons at the boundary .",
    "the delineation or bag radius was considered as a fundamental and physically measurable scale that separates ultraviolet from infrared qcd .",
    "two competing pictures emerged : the original mit bag model with a large radius surrounded by a bare vacuum and the stony - brook bag model with a small radius surrounded by pions  @xcite .",
    "in fact , at low energy this delineation is unphysical as stated in the cheshire cat principle  @xcite .",
    "quantum effects and anomalies cause most of the charges ( fermionic , axial , etc . ) to leak making the bag boundary immaterial  @xcite , much like the smile of the cheshire cat in `` alice in wonderland ''  @xcite .",
    "the skyrme model typifies the extreme realization of the cheshire cat principle whereby the immaterial bag radius is reduced to zero size @xcite .",
    "the skyrme model realizes qcd baryons as chiral solitons in the limit of large number of colors @xmath0 .",
    "recently , the same model was found to emerge from holographic qcd in the dual limit of large @xmath0 and strong coupling thooft coupling @xmath1  @xcite . in the holographic construction ,",
    "the skyrmion is the holonomy of a flavor instanton tied to witten s vertex in bulk  @xcite .",
    "baryon number at the boundary is dual to instanton number in bulk .",
    "although the exact holographic dualities are only known for a restricted set of string theories in bulk with mostly conformal field theories at the boundary  @xcite , we will assume that such a correspondence holds for holographic qcd which is not conformal .    the present paper review some aspects of the holographic baryons following recent work in  @xcite . it is dedicated to gerry brown . in section 3 ,",
    "we review the holographic baryon construction from a bulk instanton , and emphasize the emergence of the cheshire cat principle . in section 4 a top - down holographic model",
    "is briefly summarized and the bayonic current derived . in section 5 , the 2-nucleon problem is discussed usingthe adhm 2-instanton configuration . in section 6 ,",
    "cold and dense holographic matter is argued to be a crystal of instantons at low densities , and a crystal of dyons at higher densities . in section 7 , we estimate the melting temperature of these crystals into liquids .",

    "in holographic qcd , a baryon is initially described as a flavor instanton in an @xmath2 dimensional space where the holographic direction @xmath3 is warped by gravity . at large thooft coupling @xmath1 , the instanton is forced by gravity to drop to the bottom of @xmath3 .",
    "topological ( coulomb ) repulsion causes the instanton to lump at a size @xmath4 . in this limit",
    ", the effects of the gravitational warping on the instanton can be neglected .",
    "thus the instanton su(2 ) flavor configuration @xmath5 and its supporting u(1 ) coulomb potential @xmath6 read    @xmath7    with all other gauge components zero .",
    "the size is @xmath8 .",
    "we refer to  @xcite ( last reference ) for more details on the relevance of this configuration for baryons .",
    "the adhm configuration has maximal spherical symmetry and satisfies @xmath9 with @xmath10 a rigid so(3 ) rotation , and @xmath11 is su(2 ) analogue ..    the holographic baryon is just the holonomy of ( [ adhm2 ] ) along the gravity bearing and conformal direction @xmath12 ,    @xmath13    the corresponding skyrmion in large @xmath0 and leading order in the strong coupling @xmath14 is @xmath15 with the profile    @xmath16    the holonomy ( [ holo ] ) is a heavy flavor but colorless fermion `` propagating '' along the holographic direction with the instanton as a background field .",
    "the result is a small size skyrmion map @xmath17 at the boundary .",
    "the baryon emerges from a semiclassical organization of the quantum fluctuations around the point - like source ( [ holo ] ) . to achieve this",
    ", we define    @xmath18    the collective coordinates @xmath19 and the fluctuations @xmath20 in ( [ sem1 ] ) form a redundant set .",
    "the redundancy is lifted by constraining the fluctuations to be orthogonal to the zero modes .",
    "this can be achieved either rigidly  @xcite or non - rigidly  @xcite .",
    "we choose the latter as it is causality friendly .",
    "for the collective iso - rotations the non - rigid constraint reads @xmath21 with @xmath22 the real generators of @xmath23 .    for @xmath12 and @xmath24",
    "the non - rigid constraints are more natural to implement since these modes are only soft near the origin at large @xmath14 .",

    "gerry brown has been advocating the 50/50 scenario for the baryon form factor using both phenomenology and his democratic principle . in many ways , the present unwinding of the baryon current in holography supports that .",

    "however , the topological repulsion ( [ repulsion ] ) wil maintain the coulomb balance if @xmath136 .",

    "( [ dens ] ) reflects on the half - instanton symmetry of the bcc dyonic salt , which is dual to the half - skyrmion symmetry on the boundary .",
    "the density at which the splitting takes place can be estimated using the kvll instanton . indeed , in the latter dyon separation @xmath141 is  @xcite    r_+-=2 [ rpm ] with @xmath24 the kvll instanton size with zero holonomy . using ( [ rpm ] ) for our fcc crystal of cell size @xmath142 and setting @xmath143 at the transition to the bcc , yields @xmath144 or a critical density @xmath145 . in hqcd ,",

    "the cold dyonic crystal discussed in the preceding section can be dissociated by quanum fluctuations and/or thermal effects , both of which are subleading in the holographic counting .",
    "this notwithstanding , we may qualitatively ask how much temperature will be necessary to melt the instanton or dyon crystals . for that , lindemann criterion tells us that when the vibration amplitude of the lattice ion reaches @xmath160 of the nearest neighbor distance @xmath161 , the classical lattice melts  @xcite    10%a_nn [ lind ] the mean - square vibration can be estimated from the einstein formulae    m_e^2=k_bt [ eins ] with @xmath162 the einstein frequency .",
