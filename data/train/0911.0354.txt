    "a subset @xmath2 of a group @xmath3 is called a * coxeter generating set * if there is a coxeter matrix @xmath4 such that the relations @xmath5 provide a presentation of @xmath3 .",
    "a group admitting a coxeter generating set is called a * coxeter group*. in this article we consider only finitely generated coxeter groups ; this hypothesis will not be repeated anymore .",
    "any coxeter generating set of such a group is automatically finite .",
    "it is a basic and natural problem to determine all possible coxeter generating sets for a given coxeter group @xmath3 .",
    "finding an algorithmic way to describe these would actually solve the isomorphism problem for coxeter groups , which as of today remains open .",
    "substantial progress in this direction has been accomplished in recent years ( see @xcite for a 2006 survey ) , providing in particular some important reduction steps which we shall now briefly outline .",
    "given a fixed coxeter generating set @xmath2 for @xmath3 , an * @xmath2-reflection * ( or a * reflection * , if the dependence on the generating set @xmath2 does not need to be emphasised ) is an element conjugate to some element of @xmath2 .",
    "two coxeter generating sets @xmath2 and @xmath6 for @xmath3 are called * reflection - compatible * if the set of @xmath2-reflections is contained in the set of @xmath6-reflections .",
    "then the sets of @xmath2- and @xmath6-reflections coincide ( see corollary  [ cor : reflcompatible ] in appendix  [ app1 ] ) .",
    "we shall further say that @xmath2 and @xmath6 are * angle - compatible * if every * spherical * pair @xmath7 ( _ _ i.e.__every pair generating a finite subgroup ) is conjugate to some pair @xmath8 ( in particular if we put @xmath9 this implies that @xmath2 and @xmath6 are reflection - compatible ) . saying that @xmath2 and @xmath6 are angle - compatible means exactly that @xmath2 is _ sharp - angled _ with respect to @xmath6 , in the language of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , since this implies that conversely every spherical pair @xmath8 is conjugate to some pair @xmath7 ( see corollary  [ cor : anglecompatible ] ) , we prefer a symmetric way of phrasing that .",
    "reflection- and angle - compatibility are well illustrated by the simplest class of coxeter groups , namely finite dihedral groups .",
    "indeed , the dihedral group of order @xmath10 is isomorphic to the direct product of @xmath11 with the dihedral group of order @xmath12 ; the corresponding coxeter generating sets are not reflection - compatible .",
    "moreover , identifying this group with the automorphism group of a regular decagon , every generating pair of reflections is a coxeter generating set , and any two such pairs are reflection - compatible .",
    "however , they are angle - compatible if and only if the associated pairs of axes intersect at the same angle .    a first motivation to consider the notion of angle - compatibility comes from the following basic observation .",
    "the group @xmath13 contains a finite index subgroup all of whose elements map every coxeter generating set to an angle - compatible one .    indeed ,",
    "the coxeter group @xmath3 has finitely many conjugacy classes of finite subgroups ; in particular , there are finitely many conjugacy classes of pairs of elements generating a finite subgroup .",
    "the finite index normal subgroup of @xmath13 preserving the conjugacy class of each of these pairs satisfies the desired property .    a deeper reason to consider angle - compatible coxeter generating sets comes from the fact that , by the main results of @xcite and @xcite there are certain explicit operations which transform any two coxeter generating sets into angle - compatible ones ( see appendix  [ app2 ] ) .",
    "it is further conjectured in @xcite that , up to conjugation , any two angle - compatible coxeter generating sets may be obtained from one another by a finite sequence of _ elementary twists _ , a notion which was introduced in @xcite .",
    "if this conjecture is confirmed , it implies in particular that the isomorphism problem is decidable in the class of coxeter groups ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 1.1 ) ) . the main goal of this paper is to prove a basic case of this conjecture . in order to provide a precise statement , we first recall the definition of elementary twists in detail .",
    "let @xmath14 be a coxeter generating set .",
    "given a subset @xmath15 , we denote by @xmath16 the subgroup of @xmath3 generated by @xmath17 .",
    "we call @xmath17 * spherical * if @xmath16 is finite",
    ". if @xmath17 is spherical , let @xmath18 denote the longest element of @xmath16 .",
    "we say that two elements @xmath19 are * adjacent * if @xmath20 is spherical .",
    "given a subset @xmath21 , we denote by @xmath22 the set of those elements of @xmath23 which commute with @xmath17 .",
    "a subset @xmath24 is * irreducible * if it is not of the form @xmath25 for some non - empty proper subset @xmath26 .",
    "let @xmath24 be an irreducible spherical subset and assume that @xmath27 is a union of two subsets @xmath28 and @xmath29 such that @xmath30 and @xmath31 are not adjacent for all @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "this simply means that @xmath3 splits as an amalgamated product over @xmath34 .",
    "note that @xmath28 and @xmath29 are in general not uniquely determined by @xmath17 .",
    "we then consider the map @xmath35 defined by @xmath36 which is called an * elementary twist*. the relevance of this notion was first highlighted in ( * ? ?",
    "* theorem  4.5 ) , where it is shown that any elementary twist @xmath37 transforms @xmath2 into another coxeter generating set for @xmath3 .",
    "a coxeter generating set @xmath2 is called * twist - rigid * if it does not admit any elementary twist .",

    "c.   in particular , this algorithm produces as an output all possible coxeter matrices for @xmath3 .",
    "hence the isomorphism problem is decidable in the class of twist - rigid coxeter groups .",
    "note that a twist - rigid coxeter group may admit more than one conjugacy class of coxeter generating sets ( and even two coxeter generating sets with different coxeter matrices ) .",
    "in fact , the combination of theorem  [ main ] with the main results of @xcite and @xcite leads to a precise description of those coxeter groups which admit a unique conjugacy class of coxeter generating sets .",
    "however , we do not formulate this condition explicitly , since it is technical and not particularly illuminating .",
    "similarly , we could extract from the same combination of results a precise description of those twist - rigid coxeter groups whose coxeter generating sets admit only one coxeter matrix .",
    "theorem  [ main ] has been previously proved under various special assumptions , see",
    "@xcite for a 2006 state of art ( but note that the announcement of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.7 ) was too optimistic at the time ) . since then , the only contributions known to us are @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we now sketch the overall strategy governing the proof of theorem  [ main ] .",
    "our approach is inspired by @xcite .",
    "let @xmath2 and @xmath6 be two angle - compatible coxeter generating sets for @xmath3 .",
    "we call the davis complex associated with @xmath2 the * reference * davis complex , and we denote it by @xmath40 .",
    "the davis complex associated with @xmath6 is called the * ambient * davis complex , and is denoted by @xmath41 .",
    "since @xmath2 and @xmath6 are reflection - compatible , the set of @xmath2-reflections coincides with the set of @xmath6-reflections and its elements are called simply reflections .",
    "we denote by @xmath42 the wall in @xmath40 fixed by a reflection @xmath43 , and by @xmath44 the wall in @xmath41 fixed by @xmath43 . since two walls intersect non - trivially if and only if the associated reflections generate a finite group , it follows that the assignment @xmath45 preserves the parallelism relation .",
    "the coxeter generating sets @xmath2 and @xmath6 are conjugate if and only if the set @xmath46 is * geometric * in the sense that it consists of walls containing the panels of some given chamber of @xmath41 . in order to show that @xmath46 is geometric , it is enough to construct a set @xmath47 of half - spaces in @xmath48 satisfying the following .",
    "first we require that the boundary wall of each @xmath49 equals @xmath50 ( shortly , @xmath49 is a half - space * for * @xmath51 ) .",
    "second , we require that for all @xmath19 the pair @xmath52 is * geometric * , _ i.e. _  the set @xmath53 is a fundamental domain for the @xmath54-action on @xmath48 . the fact that these two conditions imply that @xmath46 is geometric is originally due to j .- y .",
    "he @xcite and was established independently by howlett ",
    "taylor  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.2 ) ( see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* fact ( 1.6 ) ) for yet another proof as well as some additional references ) .    in view of the above discussion ,",
    "proving theorem  [ main ] boils down to establishing the following .",
    "[ reduced main ] let @xmath2 and @xmath6 be angle - compatible coxeter generating sets for a group @xmath3 .",
    "assume that @xmath2 is twist - rigid .",
    "then there exists a set of half - spaces @xmath55 in @xmath48 such that @xmath49 is a half - space for @xmath51 and @xmath52 is geometric for all @xmath56    for example , if @xmath51 and @xmath57 are two elements of @xmath2 which generate an infinite dihedral group , we need to define @xmath49 as the unique half - space for @xmath51 containing the wall @xmath58 , which we denote by @xmath59 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath60 is another element with the same property , we need to verify that @xmath58 and @xmath61 lie on the same side of @xmath50 . in order to address this compatibility issue",
    ", we shall view the walls @xmath58 and @xmath62 as part of a larger family of walls parallel to @xmath63 .",
    "this family is parametrised by a certain set of data which we call _",
    "markings_.    more precisely , a marking @xmath64 with _ core _",
    "@xmath65 is a pair @xmath66 , where @xmath67 , which satisfies a number of conditions depending on the combinatorics and the geometry of @xmath40 .",
    "we will consider two particular types of markings .",
    "one type will be _ complete markings _ , which will give rise to walls parallel to @xmath50 , like in the example above .",
    "namely , we require ( in particular ) that the wall @xmath68 is parallel to @xmath69 , so that @xmath70 is parallel to @xmath71 .",
    "hence every complete marking @xmath72 with core @xmath65 induces a choice of half - space @xmath73 in @xmath41 .",
    "we will also take advantage of the fact that theorem  [ reduced main ] has been already proved for @xmath74-spherical coxeter groups @xcite .",
    "( recall that @xmath24 is called * @xmath74-spherical * if all of its two element subsets are spherical and a coxeter group is * @xmath74-spherical * if it admits a coxeter generating set @xmath2 which is @xmath74-spherical . ) in particular , each @xmath74-spherical but non - spherical subset @xmath24 containing @xmath51 gives rise to a natural choice of a half - space for @xmath51 .",

    "a marking @xmath64 of this type is called _ semi - complete_.    we next introduce a relation on the set of all complete and semi - complete markings with common core , which we call a _ move_. we show that two markings @xmath81 related by a move induce the same choice of a half - space , namely we show @xmath82 .",
    "in the special case of complete markings @xmath81 the reason for this is that @xmath83 and @xmath84 intersect .",
    "the markings discussed at the beginning , where @xmath85 , for some @xmath86 ( _ i.e. _  markings for which @xmath87 ) are part of a class of particularly well behaved _",
    "good markings_. they have , in particular , the property that @xmath77 is uniquely determined by the support @xmath17 .",
    "the major part of the proof is then to show that any two good markings with common core are related to one another by a sequence of moves .",
    "the moves can be essentially read from the coxeter diagram of @xmath88 , and this allows us to appeal to graph - theoretic arguments .",
    "since @xmath2 is assumed to be twist - rigid , there is ` enough space ' to move around the diagram of @xmath88 .",
    "we use the formalism of masur  minsky hierarchies to assemble all the data .    in the present context ,",
    "a _ hierarchy _",
    "is a system of geodesics in the coxeter diagram of @xmath88 between a pair of good markings .",
    "it is constructed in a seemingly arbitrary way , but later reveals highly organised structure .",
    "it admits a resolution into a sequence of _ slices _ which give rise to good markings related by moves .",
    "however , a new type of moves pops up out of this procedure ; to handle it we need to leave the setting of good markings and consider complete markings in full generality .",
    "we stress that the assumption that @xmath2 is twist - rigid is effectively used only in two places in the proof .",
    "we use it to prove the existence of a hierarchy with a given main geodesic ( lemma  [ hierachies exist ] ) and in a similar situation in section  [ section 2-spherical complete markings ] ( lemma  [ avoiding shadow ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the hypothesis that @xmath2 and @xmath6 are angle - compatible ( and not just reflection - compatible ) is used only in the proof of proposition  [ consistence ] and in the case where @xmath89 for some spherical @xmath90 .      in section  [ coxeter ]",
