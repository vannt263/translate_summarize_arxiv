    "the understanding of the pseudogap phase in cuprate materials constitutes an outstanding challenge in condensed matter physics . at present , it remains unsolved whether the phase is caused by singlet formation naturally exhibited in strong - coupling models , or rather by an elusive spontaneously symmetry - broken phase .    in a recent series of spin - polarized neutron scattering experiments",
    ", it has been observed that intra - unit cell antiferromagnetic order sets in at @xmath1 , the pseudogap temperature in the underdoped regime of yba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 and hgba@xmath2cuo@xmath5.@xcite recently , a short - range magnetic intra - unit cell signal was also identified in la@xmath6sr@xmath7cuo@xmath8 though at temperatures significantly below @xmath1.@xcite these results suggest that the pseudogap phase may in fact be associated with a true phase transition with an associated spontaneously broken symmetry .",
    "varma has predicted that the pseudogap phase is caused by equilibrium loop currents which break the time - reversal symmetry but preserve the translational invariance of the cuo@xmath2 lattice.@xcite a recent theoretical study@xcite found that such loop currents can be stabilized by using the apical oxygen ions leading to ordered moments rotated away from the axis perpendicular to the cuo@xmath2 plane in qualitative agreement with the neutron measurements .",
    "the possible existence of loop order remains highly controversial , however , since local probes fail to detect the weak magnetic field associated with such orbital currents .",
    "for example , nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) , nuclear quadropole resonance ( nqr ) , and muon spin relaxation ( @xmath9sr ) have failed to detect any onset of magnetic order setting in at @xmath1.@xcite most recently , a high - precision zero - field @xmath9sr study on la@xmath10sr@xmath11cuo@xmath0 found no evidence of static magnetic order in the pseudogap phase at doping levels above @xmath12 , which is outside the spin - glass phase in lsco.@xcite various proposals , including minority phases , loop - order fluctuations , and local muon destruction of loop order have surfaced to reconcile the apparent contradiction between local probes and neutron experiments.@xcite at present , the possible existence of loop order remains unsettled and therefore new proposals for its detection seem desirable .",
    "scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) is a natural approach to take .",
    "sts experiments on @xmath13 , for example , have found evidence for intra - unit cell `` nematic '' symmetry breaking , which shows up as an inequivalency of oxygen @xmath14 and @xmath15 orbitals.@xcite unfortunately , loop order does not have such a simple experimental signature , since the local density of states ( ldos ) has the same @xmath16 symmetry as the lattice .",
    "the loop currents are expected to generate a nonzero density of states at the fermi energy,@xcite but are not unique in this ; other mechanisms , such as disorder , also generate low energy excitations .    in this paper , we show that there is a clear signature of loop currents if one considers the ldos near an isolated impurity . in the literature ,",
    "disorder effects have been previously suggested as a probe of the so - called @xmath17-density wave candidate for the pseudogap phase.@xcite here , our aim is not to answer whether loop currents exist , but rather to suggest new  smoking gun \" experiments based on their assumed existence .",
    "we focus on the low - temperature coexistence phase of loop order and @xmath17-wave superconductivity since this is where sts measurements are most readily performed .",
    "we use a mean - field three - band model to study the effects of loop order on the ldos near non - magnetic impurities .",
    "our main result [ fig .",
    "[ fig : ldospatterns ] ] is that there is a distinct @xmath16 symmetry breaking in the vicinity of the impurity , and an associated splitting of the so - called  octet \" vectors in the fourier transformed scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( ft - sts ) patterns arising from quasi - particle interference ( qpi ) .",
    "these effects can be explained solely from symmetry arguments , and result from momentum - selective shifts of the nodal dirac points in the @xmath17-wave superconductor in the presence of loop order .",
    "we employ the three - band hubbard hamiltonian with mean - field decoupled interactions.@xcite as shown recently , loop currents are stable in this model when the nearest - neighbor repulsion @xmath18 is sufficiently large compared to the onsite repulsions on the copper @xmath19 and oxygen @xmath20 sites.@xcite in this paper , we assume the existence of loop currents and study their detectable consequences .",
    "the three - band hamiltonian is a minimal model containing the essential symmetries of the problem .",
    "experiments@xcite suggest that the current loops involve out - of - plane orbitals,@xcite which are not part of the model .",
    "these additional orbitals are neglected for simplicity , as they do not change the rotational symmetries of the hamiltonian , and it is these symmetries that determine the symmetry of the ldos pattern near an impurity .    in the three - orbital basis @xmath21 the normal - state hamiltonian including orbital currents takes the form @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are @xmath25-matrices .",
    "@xmath23 describes the hopping part of the hamiltonian as well as the decoupled on - site interactions , whereas @xmath24 carries the decoupled oxygen - copper interactions and is thus responsible for the loop currents .    writing out equation yields the following expression for the hamiltonian :    @xmath26    where @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "following e.g.  hybertsen _ et al._,@xcite we use the following set of parameter values ; @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 ( all in ev ) . in eq.([eq:3by3hamiltonian ] ) , @xmath33 denotes the mean - field order parameter for the orbital currents , and is set to either zero or , in the current - carrying case , to @xmath34 .",
    "this phase choice of @xmath33 leads to a current - carrying state in accordance with the original mean - field formulation by varma.@xcite the main results of this paper are not sensitive to the amplitude of @xmath33.@xcite    to include @xmath17-wave superconductivity , we change to a six - operator nambu basis given by @xmath35 . the hamiltonian is then given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the @xmath25 matrix describing the cooper - pairing in our model .",
    "for simplicity , we take all cooper pairing to be on the copper orbital which in the present case is a good approximation because the band crossing the fermi level is mainly of cu orbital character when @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "we assume the gap function to have @xmath38-symmetry with @xmath39 other choices for @xmath37 , involving pairing in the oxygen orbitals , are possible ; however , these will not change the symmetry of the ldos pattern . to allow us to focus on spectral features below the gap ,",
    "we take an artificially large @xmath40 ev .",
    "the free green s function for this system is now , for each @xmath41 , a @xmath42 matrix in orbital and spin indices given by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the @xmath42 matrix of eq . ,",
    "and @xmath45 is an infinitesimal regulator .",
    "finally , we introduce a pointlike non - magnetic impurity at the copper site belonging to the unit cell at @xmath46 .",
    "the impurity hamiltonian is @xmath47 using a standard @xmath48-matrix formalism , the full green s function is then given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 from the full green s function , the local density of states @xmath51 on the orbital @xmath52 in the unit cell @xmath53 is readily obtained from the formula ( for the superconducting state ) @xmath54 with @xmath55 labeling spin .",
    "the qpi spectrum is then obtained from the fourier transformed density of states : @xmath56.\\ ] ]",
    "+    the ldos patterns in the vicinity of the impurity are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : ldospatterns ] , along with the corresponding current patterns .",
    "the current pattern denoted by @xmath57 is generated by the hamiltonian  .",
    "the other two current patterns are obtained by changing the off - diagonal entries of @xmath58 : @xmath59    schematically , the unit cell in real space can be represented as @xmath60 which also provides a legend for reading fig .",
    "[ fig : ldospatterns ] . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : ldospatterns ] , the symmetries of the ldos patterns are inherited from the spatial symmetries of the loop order , with the obvious additional rule that the directions of the current arrows play no role in the ldos . these symmetries are tabulated in table  [ tab : numerical_symmetries ] , and are easily obtained from the symmetries of eq .",
    "( [ gfull ] ) .",
    "we stress that in the clean phase , the ldos has the full symmetry of the lattice , and that it is only near an impurity that the distinctive signatures of the loop currents are revealed .",
    ".symmetries of the ldos near an impurity . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     we can understand the broken spatial symmetries presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : ldospatterns ] by consulting the contours of constant energy ( cce ) of the bare band structure . as in the case of a pure @xmath17-wave superconductor , the band structure inside the gap yields closed banana - shaped cce which increase in size with the energy @xmath61 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bananas](a ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : bananas](b ) we see the effect of orbital currents with @xmath57 on the cce ; while two of the dirac cones are left invariant , the other two are shifted upwards / downwards in energy.@xcite these distorted bananas respect the same symmetries as the current patterns . changing the current direction corresponds to interchanging the large and small bananas whereas changing the current pattern @xmath62 causes a @xmath16 rotation of the ldos as expected .",
    "experimentally , the cce may be inferred from qpi patterns measured by tunneling experiments . for pure @xmath17-wave superconductors",
    ", these qpi patterns have been explained using a simple `` octet '' model,@xcite in which peaks in the qpi pattern are attributed to scattering between portions of the cce for which the joint density of states is high .",
    "figure  [ fig : bananas](a ) shows the octet vector @xmath63 , which labels the most prominent `` intra - banana '' quasiparticle scattering process .",
    "the effect of @xmath64 loop currents on @xmath63 is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : bananas](b ) : the @xmath63 peaks along the left diagonal are split into @xmath65 and @xmath66 , while those along the right diagonal remain unchanged .",
    "this uniaxial distortion is certainly seen in the calculated qpi spectrum shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : paperfigure3](a - d ) which display @xmath67 at @xmath68 ev as a function of @xmath69 .",
    "in addition , fig .",
    "[ fig : paperfigure3](e ) shows how the identification of the @xmath63 peaks in the qpi spectrum is in very good agreement with the octet model prediction obtained directly from the cces . as is evident from e.g. fig .",
    "[ fig : bananas](b ) , the other ( than @xmath63 ) characteristic @xmath69-vectors of the octet model connecting the banana tips will be slightly rotated off the center axis in the presence of circulating current loop order .",
    "there are a number of possible caveats to the present proposal that should be discussed .",
    "first of all , the presence of dynamical loop order fluctuations will clearly be detrimental to the observation of @xmath16 spatial symmetry breaking .",
    "second , the existence of various domains with respectively @xmath57 and @xmath70 loop order will `` symmetrize '' the qpi images and roughly result in a smeared version of the qpi from a pure @xmath17-wave superconductor without current loops",
    ". the local @xmath16 symmetry breaking near a single impurity should still be detectable in this case .",
    "for bscco , however , it is expected that the ldos near single - site disorder is further complicated by intrinsic disorder and the structural supermodulation.@xcite finally , we should also mention that the current calculation is not self - consistent and the feedback effect of the impurity on the local current loops is not included .",
    "the effect of a charged impurity on the loops has been addressed previously in the discussion of the potential disturbance of the @xmath71 on the current order.@xcite in the present case it is unlikely that the local suppression of loop currents would restore the symmetry .",
    "thus , we expect the overall conclusion of @xmath16 symmetry breaking near disorder sites to remain valid .    in summary ,",
    "we have shown how spatial @xmath16 symmetry may become broken in the ldos around nonmagnetic impurities in the coexistence phase of loop order and @xmath17-wave superconductivity .",
    "in addition there exists an associated splitting and/or rotation of the so - called octet peaks evident in the quasiparticle interference patterns .",
    "these predictions should be testable by future tunneling measurements .",
