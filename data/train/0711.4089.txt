    "in high-@xmath8 cuprate superconductors the study of the pairing symmetry remains a very active field of research and microwave measurements using resonant structures have shown to be particularly useful to detect its signatures .",
    "indeed , when a microwave resonant cavity is loaded with a conducting sample , we can measure shifts of the resonance frequency and of the quality factor q , which can be related to the real and imaginary parts of the complex conductivity @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "based on the two - fluid model for a superconductor , condensed pairs and quasiparticles both contribute to @xmath10 which in turn determine the temperature dependence of the magnetic penetration depth @xmath11 and the quasiparticle relaxation rate @xmath12@xcite .    the @xmath13-wave symmetry is now well established in hole - doped cuprates superconductors @xcite .",
    "however , the situation remains controversial in electron - doped ones @xmath14",
    "@xmath15 @xcite .",
    "when single crystals are used , residual microwave absorption is generally measured in the superconducting state and this could impede any precise determination of @xmath16 .",
    "this residual absorption is likely due to an inhomogeneous oxygen reduction process over the volume of the crystal , a reduction which is mandatory to induce the superconducting state . in this respect ,",
    "thin films of these materials appear more adapted to microwave experiments .",
    "indeed , high - quality @xmath14 thin films can be grown by pulsed laser ablation on appropriate substrates .",
    "their small thickness and an in - situ post - annealing ensures a homogeneous reduction over the complete volume of the sample .",
    "there is , however , an important difference between microwave measurements of thick samples ( single crystals ) and thin samples ( thin films ) which has not been completely overcome yet experimentally .",
    "the perturbation of a microwave cavity by a small sample of variable conducting properties is an old problem that has been treated with different approaches for thin superconducting films @xcite .",
    "however , a general procedure proposing to treat the cavity loaded with a perfect conductor sample as the unperturbed state and to find the shifts when the sample becomes a non - perfect conductor , appears particularly promising for high conductivity thin films .",
    "a general expression has been obtained for two intracavity arrangements and analytical solutions were found for the slab geometry of a thin film @xcite .",
    "the general solution for the complex frequency shift reduces to the shchegolev formula @xcite in the depolarization limit when the microwave electric field fully penetrates the sample , and to the skin depth regime when the microwave penetration depth becomes smaller than the size of the sample and the complex frequency shift is related to the surface impedance @xcite .",
    "thin films having different thicknesses and conductivity can thus be treated anywhere between the depolarization regime and the regime close to the skin depth one @xcite . however , the high - temperature superconducting thin films are grown on dielectric substrates having relative permittivity @xmath17 around 20",
    ". hence , when the sample is introduced in the microwave cavity , the substrate changes the field configuration asymmetrically around the sample and modifies the frequency shifts .",
    "a method has been proposed to mimic this asymmetric solution by introducing the concept of a fictitious substitute sample .",
    "this method has been tested on thin films of hole - doped cuprates mounted in a cylindrical cavity resonating in the te@xmath18 mode @xcite .    in this paper we present microwave measurements on optimally doped pr@xmath0ce@xmath1cuo@xmath2 ( pcco ) thin films grown on a @xmath19 substrate mounted in the electric field of a rectangular cavity .",
    "we use the general solution for the complex frequency shift in microwave electric field in the high conductivity limit @xcite .",
    "however , to deduce the complex conductivity from the measured frequency shifts , the fictitious substitute sample method could not be applied to our measurements to take into account the impact of the dielectric substrate .",
    "we rather propose a modified version of the method presented by peligrad _",
    "_ exploiting the measurements of the same sample at two different resonance frequencies and by analyzing different substrate configurations .",
    "then , the frequency shifts are transformed into complex penetration depth and microwave conductivity data .",
    "these results obtained on two films of different quality are discussed in terms of a two - fluid model .",
    "the characteristics of the superconducting state are found to be very similar to the ones obtained in the hole - doped cuprates .",
    "the pcco thin films were grown by pulsed laser deposition on standard @xmath19 substrates and their thickness was measured with a scanning electronic microscope at grazing incidence giving a precision of 5 nm .",
    "prior to the microwave measurements , the films were also characterized by four - probe resistivity and ac magnetic susceptibility measurements were performed in a ppms from quantum design between 4 and 300 k. for the two films investigated here , we give in table 1 the values of the thickness @xmath20 , the critical temperature @xmath8 and the minimum value of the resistivity @xmath21 appearing between 14 and 15 k when a magnetic field of 9 t suppresses the superconducting state @xcite .",
    "@xmath8 is determined from the microwave experiment as indicated in the next section .",
    "the microwave measurements were performed with a cavity perturbation technique in the transmission mode .",
    "we used a rectangular copper cavity for which the te@xmath5 ( 16.5 ghz ) and te@xmath6 ( 13 ghz ) resonance modes could be excited . a synthesized sweeper and a scalar network analyzer",
    "are used to acquire the resonance curve of each mode after averaging and smoothing .",
    "a lorentzian fit of the curve then yields the resonance frequency @xmath22 and the half width at half maximum @xmath23 .",
    "this is done for the cavity with and without the sample installed in the maximum electric field position in order to obtain the relative frequency shifts @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",

    "the relative frequency shifts presented in this section will be treated with the formula valid in the high conductivity limit for a slab oriented with its length along the maximum electric field @xcite .",
    "because our frequency shifts are measured relative to an empty cavity when the formula implies shifts relative to a cavity perturbed by a perfect conductor ( unperturbed state ) , we first describe the appropriate correction to transform one into the other .",
    "then , we explain how the substrate effects are included in the treatment .",
    "finally , the temperature dependence of the complex in - plane penetration depth @xmath27 = @xmath28 - i@xmath29 obtained from the frequency shifts and the subsequent complex conductivity data @xmath30 for two pcco films are presented and discussed .",
    "theoretically , when a slab of a perfect conductor is introduced in the electric field of the cavity , the relative shift in resonance frequency @xmath31 depends only on a geometrical factor @xmath7 = @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are respectively the filling and the depolarization factors .",

    "the temperature and frequency dependence of these relative shifts is fully consistent with a superconducting sample in the high conductivity limit @xcite , except for @xmath31 above @xmath8 for the 16.5 ghz mode .",

    "; we thus expect a temperature dependence of the resonance frequency very similar to an empty cavity and , thus , a constant @xmath7 .",
    "the situation is more complex for the te@xmath5 mode since the sample is located in only one of the two lobes yielding an asymmetrical perturbation of the mode .",
    "the resonance frequency as a function of temperature is thus expected to be modified relative to the empty cavity and this yields a @xmath35 which explains the non monotonous temperature behavior observed at 16.5 ghz .",
    "we should recall that the temperature dependence of the resonance frequency is due to a progressive increase of the cavity volume above 20 k.    since the comparison of the complex penetration depth @xmath27(t ) at two frequencies will validate our approach , it is important to correct the @xmath31 data at 16.5 ghz .",
    "we show this correction in the inset of fig .",
    "1 . since the perturbation of the mode",
    "is mainly observed above 20 k , we use a polynomial fit to mimic these effects which are subsequently substracted from the original data .",
    "if the thin film alone constituted the sample , the constant @xmath7 could be calculated with sufficient precision by associating its geometry to an elongated ellipsoid .",
    "however , the @xmath19 substrate makes @xmath7 an undetermined parameter depending on the particular sample and on the resonance mode of the cavity . for each sample , we thus define two parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 keeping in mind that these parameters are related since the value of the magnetic penetration depth @xmath38 must be frequency independent .",

    "<S> the relative frequency shifts obtained for the samples placed at a maximum electric field location in the cavity are treated using the high conductivity limit presented recently by peligrad @xmath3 @xmath4 using two resonance modes , te@xmath5 ( 16.5 ghz ) and te@xmath6 ( 13 ghz ) of the same cavity , only one adjustable parameter @xmath7 is needed to link the frequency shifts of an empty cavity to the ones of a cavity loaded with a perfect conductor . moreover , by studying different sample configurations , we can relate the substrate effects on the frequency shifts to a scaling factor . </S>",
    "<S> these procedures allow us to extract the temperature dependence of the complex penetration depth and the complex microwave conductivity of two films with different quality . </S>",
    "<S> our data confirm that all the physical properties of the superconducting state are consistent with an order parameter with lines of nodes . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we demonstrate the high sensitivity of these properties on the quality of the films . </S>"
