    "the ubiquitous presence of turbulence impacts the evolution of many space and astrophysical plasma environments , mediating the transport of energy from violent events or instabilities at large scales down to the small scales at which the energy is ultimately converted to heat of the protons , electrons , and minor ions .",
    "it is widely believed that plasma turbulence plays an important role in heating the solar corona to millions of degrees kelvin , accelerating the solar wind to hundreds of kilometers per second , regulating star formation , transporting heat in galaxy clusters , and affecting the injection of particles and energy into the earth s magnetosphere . at the forefront of plasma turbulence research",
    "is the effort to identify the physical mechanisms by which the turbulent fluctuations are damped and their energy converted to plasma heat or some other energization of particles .",
    "in contrast to the intermittent filaments of vorticity that arise in hydrodynamic turbulence @xcite , intermittent current sheets are found to develop in plasma turbulence @xcite .",
    "recent work investigating the statistics of these coherent structures , self - consistently generated by the plasma turbulence , has demonstrated that the dissipation of turbulent energy is largely concentrated in these current sheets @xcite . since current sheets",
    "are associated with enhanced dissipation , illuminating their origin and nature is critical to identifying the dominant physical mechanisms of dissipation in plasma turbulence .    how current sheets develop in plasma turbulence",
    "is a longstanding question in the study of space and astrophysical plasmas @xcite .",
    "early work focused on the study of solar coronal loops , asking if the continuous motion of line - tied footpoints in ideal mhd would lead an initially smooth magnetic field to develop a tangential discontinuity @xcite , necessarily supported by a sheet of finite current , according to maxwell s equations .",
    "it was argued that continuous footpoint motion can not generate a discontinuous magnetic field @xcite , but later shown that current layers of finite but arbitrarily small thickness were realizable through continuous footpoint motion @xcite .",
    "of course , in the more complete kinetic plasma description , current layers generally have structure at both characteristic ion and electron length scales ; kinetic simulations of plasma turbulence indeed observe the development of current sheets of finite thickness @xcite .",
    "recent spacecraft measurements of current sheets in the near - earth solar wind have lead to fundamental questions about their origin and their influence on plasma heating .",
    "do the measured current sheets represent advected flux tube boundaries @xcite , or are they generated dynamically by the turbulence itself @xcite ? in the past few years , vigorous activity has focused on the spatial localization of plasma heating by the dissipation of turbulence in current sheets through statistical analyses of solar wind observations @xcite and numerical simulations @xcite .    to understand the origin of coherent structures",
    ", we must investigate how the turbulent nonlinear interactions govern their development @xcite . in plasma turbulence",
    ", the alfvn wave represents the fundamental response of the plasma to an applied perturbation .",
    "early research on incompressible mhd turbulence in the 1960s @xcite emphasized the wave - like nature of turbulent plasma motions , suggesting that nonlinear interactions between counterpropagating alfvn waves  or _ alfvn wave collisions_mediate the turbulent cascade of energy from large to small scales .",
    "the alfvn wave remains central to modern theories of mhd turbulence that provide explanations for the anisotropic nature of the turbulent cascade @xcite and the dynamic alignment of velocity and magnetic field fluctuations @xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we demonstrate that the generation of current sheets in plasma turbulence is a natural consequence of strong alfvn wave collisions .",
    "furthermore , we present a first - principles explanation for this current sheet development in terms of the nonlinear dynamics , showing that the current sheet can be accurately reconstructed from a linear superposition of the interacting alfvn waves and a surprisingly small number of nonlinearly generated modes .",
    "the properties of the resulting current sheet are compared to previously published observations of current sheets in turbulence in the earth s magnetosheath @xcite and the solar wind @xcite .",
    "finally , we discuss implications for the damping of current sheets generated by strong alfvn wave collisions .",
    "although the incompressible mhd equations lack a number of physical effects that occur in realistic space and astrophysical plasmas , they do contain the minimal ingredients that lead to the anisotropic cascade and development of current sheets in plasma turbulence .",
    "expressed here in the symmetric elsasser form , these equations are @xmath0 and @xmath1 . here",
    "@xmath2 is the alfvn velocity due to the equilibrium field @xmath3 where @xmath4 , @xmath5 is total pressure ( thermal plus magnetic ) , @xmath6 is mass density , and @xmath7 are the elsasser fields which represent waves that propagate up or down the mean magnetic field .",

    "the limit of strong incompressible mhd turbulence occurs when @xmath10 , in which the nonlinear energy transfer timescale is comparable to the linear wave period , a condition known as critical balance @xcite .",
    "following significant previous studies on weak incompressible mhd turbulence @xcite , the nonlinear energy transfer in alfvn wave collisions has recently been solved analytically in the weakly nonlinear limit @xmath11 @xcite , confirmed numerically with gyrokinetic numerical simulations @xcite , and verified experimentally in the laboratory @xcite , establishing alfvn wave collisions as the fundamental building block of astrophysical plasma turbulence . here",
    "we briefly review the details of the nonlinear energy transfer in the weak turbulence limit , @xmath12 .",
    "consider the nonlinear interaction between two perpendicularly polarized , counterpropagating alfvn waves with wavevectors @xmath13 and @xmath14 , as shown in fig .",

    "the lowest order nonlinear interaction in the asymptotic solution creates an inherently nonlinear , purely magnetic mode with wavevector @xmath17 ( green triangle ) .",
    "this secondary mode has @xmath18 and frequency @xmath19 , but does not grow secularly in time . at next order , the primary modes then interact with this secondary @xmath18 mode to transfer energy secularly to two nonlinearly generated alfvn waves ( blue squares ) , where @xmath20 transfers energy to an alfvn wave with @xmath21 , and @xmath22 transfers energy to @xmath23 .",
    "this process is the fundamental mechanism by which turbulence transfers energy anisotropically from large to small scales @xcite .",
    "although the analytical solution for the dynamics of alfvn wave collisions is calculated in the mhd approximation , we employ here a gyrokinetic code for two reasons : ( 1 ) to demonstrate that the physical mechanism is not altered under the weakly collisional plasma conditions relevant to many space and astrophysical plasma environments ; and , ( 2 ) to enable the direct comparison of current sheet profiles from our simulations to spacecraft measurements in the weakly collisional solar wind .",

    "although the analytical solution @xcite is strictly valid only for weak nonlinearity @xmath11 , even for the moderately strong nonlinearity of @xmath56 , the solution remains relatively accurate ; at @xmath57 , the solution ceases to be quantitatively correct ( since the primary modes lose significant energy through the vigorous nonlinear energy transfer ) , but the general picture of the secular transfer of energy mediated by nonlinearly generated @xmath18 modes to nonlinearly produced daughter alfvn waves remains qualitatively correct .",
    "the primary numerical result reported here is the discovery that , as the amplitudes of the colliding alfvn waves increase to the strong turbulence limit , @xmath52 , the transient development of a current sheet is a natural consequence .",
    "the current sheet resulting from a nonlinear gyrokinetic simulation of a strong alfvn wave collision with @xmath57 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : interfere](a ) , where the normalized parallel current @xmath58 ( colorbar ) and positive ( black ) and negative ( white ) contours of the parallel vector potential , @xmath27 , are plotted across a plane perpendicular to the equilibrium magnetic field at @xmath59 and @xmath60 , where the alfvn wave period is @xmath61 and @xmath62 .    the current sheet in the upper right quadrant may be characterized by its width @xmath63 and thickness @xmath64 in the perpendicular plane , its length along the equilibrium magnetic field @xmath65 , and its lifetime @xmath66 .",
    "the width @xmath63 , thickness @xmath64 , and length @xmath65 are determined using the full - width , half - maximum extent of the current density in each of these directions .",
    "the lifetime @xmath66 is estimated as the time over which its peak current density exceeds half the global maximum in the simulation domain .",
    "we find width @xmath67 and thickness @xmath68 , yielding an aspect ratio of @xmath69 .",
    "the parallel length is @xmath70 , and the total lifetime from the beginning of current sheet formation to the end of its decay is @xmath71 .",
    "so , what controls the self - consistently generated current sheet s lifetime and morphology ?",
    "the length @xmath65 along the equilibrium magnetic field and its width @xmath63 in the perpendicular plane are determined by the parallel and perpendicular components of the wavelengths of the original interacting alfvn waves .",
    "the lifetime of this current sheet is related to the period of the original ( large - scale ) alfvn waves , a time much longer than the alfvn crossing time across the thickness @xmath64 of the current sheet .",
    "the thickness @xmath64 appears to approach the smallest resolvable perpendicular scale in the simulation .",
    "however , in this particular simulation , the thickness @xmath64 also happens to be approximately the scale @xmath72 where the linear physics becomes dispersive , in other words the thickness is coincident with the perpendicular wavelength where the non - dispersive alfvn waves convert to dispersive kinetic alfvn waves .",
    "further exploration is required to determine whether the current sheet thickness is bounded by the simulation resolution or by the decoupling of ions from the electromagnetic fluctuations at @xmath72 .",
    "note that plasma turbulence simulations ubiquitously show the development of current sheets @xcite which sometimes appear to persist for a long time relative to other turbulent fluctuations on the scale of the thickness of the current sheet .",
    "this mechanism for current sheet generation may explain why these current sheets appear to persist for a long time because their lifetime is governed by the interaction of much larger scale alfvn waves .",
    "the period of those large scale alfvn waves is much longer than the period of the turbulent fluctuations on the scale of the current sheet thickness , resulting in a persistent current sheet .",
    "the key conceptual result presented here is an explanation for this current sheet development in terms of the nonlinear dynamics of strong alfvn wave collisions . in the weakly nonlinear limit , @xmath11 ,",
    "the nonlinearly generated alfvn waves @xmath73 are the dominant recipients of the energy transferred secularly to smaller scales , where the self - consistently generated @xmath74 mode , which has @xmath18 , mediates the transfer .",
    "but , as the colliding alfvn wave amplitudes increase to the strongly nonlinear limit , @xmath75 , the asymptotic expansion of the equations of evolution ceases to be well - ordered , so higher - order terms  terms that can safely be neglected in the weakly nonlinearly limit ",
    "begin to contribute significantly .",
    "nonetheless , the dominant pathway of the nonlinear energy transfer mediated by self - consistently generated @xmath18 modes , found in the weakly nonlinear limit , persists as one approaches and reaches the strongly nonlinear limit , @xmath76 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : chi_scan ] .",
    "this persistence of the nonlinear energy transfer mechanism is due to the fact that the phases and amplitudes of all of the nonlinearly generated modes are determined by the mathematical form of the nonlinear term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : elsasserpm ] ) , even in the strongly nonlinear limit .",
    "if the nonlinearly generated modes rise to sufficient amplitudes , as occurs in the strongly nonlinear limit , they may constructively interfere with the primary alfvn waves to create a coherent structure , in this case a current sheet .",
    "a simple analogy for the development of a coherent structure by the interference of a sum of sinusoidal modes is the square wave , given by the infinite sum of fourier modes , @xmath77 .",
    "current sheet development in plasma turbulence is similar , but involves the sum of fourier modes spanning the two - dimensional plane perpendicular to the local mean magnetic field , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : modes_o5 ] . the fluctuations arising from the turbulent cascade , although they may appear random , in fact have phase and amplitude relationships determined by the nonlinear terms in the governing nonlinear equations of evolution .",
    "it is these nonlinearly determined phase and amplitude relationships that give rise to the coherent structures that arise from what may appear to be random turbulent fluctuations .",
    "a consequence of this insight is that the current sheet development can be predicted analytically , as is demonstrated below by a direct comparison between the analytical calculation and a nonlinear numerical simulation for the moderately nonlinear case of @xmath56 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : predict](a ) , we plot the normalized parallel current @xmath58 across the perpendicular plane at @xmath78 for the @xmath56 simulation . although the current sheet formation here is not as rapid or intense as the @xmath57 case , the tendency for the current to elongate into a sheet - like coherent structure is apparent . using the analytical solution for the nonlinear evolution of alfvn wave collisions presented in @xcite , we compute a first - principles , analytical prediction of the current sheet development for this @xmath56 simulation , shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : predict](b ) . for this analytical prediction",
    ", we have included only the five lowest order modes shown in fig .",
    "1 : @xmath79 , @xmath22 , @xmath74 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 .",
    "this demonstration that the current sheet development is a result of interference between just five complex fourier modes in the perpendicular plane , and can be predicted analytically from a rigorous first - principles calculation , supports the hypothesis that interference between the primary and nonlinearly generated fourier modes is responsible for the development of current sheets in alfvn wave collisions .",
    "but the qualitative properties of the nonlinear energy transfer imply a further major simplification of the nonlinear evolution . for the particular wavevectors specified for the two primary counterpropagating alfvn waves , @xmath82 , the mathematical form of the nonlinear term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : elsasserpm ] ) fixes the value of @xmath83 for all nonlinearly generated modes to be constant along lines of slope 1 ( thin diagonal arrows ) on the @xmath84 plane in fig .",
    "[ fig : modes_o5 ] .",
    "since the energy transfer is mediated by self - consistently generated @xmath18 modes , energy is preferentially transferred to fourier modes falling along the @xmath85 , @xmath18 , and @xmath86 lines @xcite , so it is just these relatively few modes that govern the current sheet development . in fig .",
    "[ fig : interfere](b)(f ) , we plot a successively increasing number of modes just along these three diagonal lines , filtering out all other modes from the @xmath57 simulation : ( b ) just the two primary alfvn waves @xmath87 and @xmath88 ; ( c ) adding the self - consistently generated @xmath18 mode at @xmath89 for 3 total modes ; ( d ) adding @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 for 6 modes ; ( e ) adding @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 for 9 modes ; and ( f ) adding @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 for 12 total modes .",
    "the successive addition of these modes in this figure confirms that constructive interference among these modes leads to the observed current sheet structure . by comparing the results of the full simulation in ( a ) to the plot with just 12 modes in (",
    "f)only 1.3% of the 945 possible complex fourier modes in the simulation  the structure of the current sheet from the full simulation is quite accurately reproduced , showing only minor quantitative differences .",
    "do the current sheets generated by strong alfvn wave collisions have similar properties to those measured in space plasmas ? to address this important question , we sample the current sheet in our simulation along the trajectory given by the black line in fig .  [",
    "fig : interfere](a ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : slices ] , we plot the resulting profiles of the normalized magnetic field @xmath99 in both simulation @xmath100 and minimum variance @xmath101 coordinates , normalized current @xmath102 , normalized electric field @xmath103 , and normalized @xmath104 .",
    "these profiles compare favorably with published measurements of the magnetic field variation in minimum variance coordinates and of @xmath105 across current sheets from turbulence in the magnetosheath @xcite and solar wind @xcite .",
    "this preliminary comparison motivates future efforts to make a more detailed statistical comparison of the properties of current sheets arising in strong alfvn wave collisions with those measured by spacecraft missions .",
    "the nonlinear dynamics of strong alfvn wave collisions provides a natural explanation for the ubiquitous development of current sheets in plasma turbulence .",
    "the discovery that current sheets arise transiently through constructive interference among the primary waves and nonlinearly generated modes provides valuable insight into the physical mechanisms by which the turbulent fluctuations are damped . because the dominant constructively interfering modes are @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) alfvn waves that propagate in the @xmath106 ( @xmath107 ) direction and @xmath18 modes nonlinearly generated by the interactions between these counterpropagating waves , collisionless damping of the constituent alfvn waves via the landau resonance with protons and electrons is expected to play an important role in the dissipation of the current sheets , as previously suggested @xcite",
    "of course , other mechanisms exist that can produce current sheets , such as particular flow and magnetic field geometries , like the orszag - tang vortex .",
    "a final question that remains to be answered is whether such alternative mechanisms play any role in the development of current sheets in solar wind turbulence , or are strong alfvn wave collisions sufficient to account for all current sheets observed in the turbulent solar wind ?",
