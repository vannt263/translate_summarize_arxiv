    "the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) is capable of constraining @xmath8 over the range @xmath11 , where @xmath4 is the gluon momentum fraction in the proton .",
    "the solenoid tracker at rhic ( star ) is performing a wide range of measurements to constrain gluon polarization , including inclusive jets , inclusive @xmath12 and di - jets .",
    "the longitudinal double spin asymmetry , @xmath0 , for jets and @xmath12 is defined as the ratio of the difference of differential cross sections when proton beams have the same and opposite helicities over the sum of the two cross sections .",
    "jet and @xmath13 production in @xmath1 collisions arise from three parton scattering processes : gluon - gluon ( @xmath14 ) , quark - gluon ( @xmath15 ) and quark - quark ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) indicates that in rhic kinematics @xmath15 and @xmath14 dominate .",
    "the partonic longitudinal double spin asymmetry is large in this kinematic range.@xcite@xcite therefore jet and @xmath12 @xmath0 are sensitive to the polarized gluon distribution in the proton , making star ideal to explore gluon polarization .",
    "rhic is a world - leading facility capable of colliding either longitudinally or transversely polarized proton beams at energies up to @xmath17 gev .",
    "the major detectors at star for jet and @xmath12 measurements are the time projection chamber ( tpc ) , barrel electromagnetic calorimeter ( bemc ) , endcap electromagnetic calorimeter ( eemc ) , and forward meson spectrometer ( fms).@xcite the tpc provides high - resolution tracking for charged particles in the magnetic field of 0.5 t with acceptance @xmath18 and @xmath19 in azimuth .",
    "the bemc , eemc and fms detect neutral energy over @xmath19 in azimuth but covering different @xmath20 ranges : @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "there are several other detectors , including the vertex position detector ( vpd ) , zero degree calorimeter(zdc ) and beam beam counter ( bbc ) , for relative luminosity and local polarimetry measurements.@xcite",
    "star has measured the inclusive jet cross section and @xmath0 in 200 gev @xmath1 collisions and performed detailed comparisons between the data and monte carlo simulations.@xcite@xcite jet measurements probe gluon polarization at @xmath4 as low as 0.05 at @xmath24 = 200 gev and even lower @xmath4 at @xmath24 = 510 gev . in real data , jets are constructed from detector responses . pythia@xcite and geant@xcite simulations are used to generate monte carlo events and simulate detector responses to estimate systematic uncertainties . not only are detector level jets reconstructed from simulated detector responses , but also particle level jets from hadronization and parton level jets from scattered partons are studied from pythia records to compare with detector level jets .",
    "previous star measurements used the mid - point code algorithm@xcite to reconstruct jets with seed energy 0.5 gev , and jet cone radius 0.7 in @xmath25 space .",
    "the inclusive jet @xmath0 from 2006 data@xcite excludes a number of theoretical scenarios that predict large gluon polarization in the accessible @xmath4 range .",
    "the dssv model , the first global analysis with star 2006 inclusive jet @xmath0 included , found a relatively small gluon contribution to the proton spin at the @xmath4 region where 2006 star data reside , @xmath26.@xcite    in 2009 , star collected nearly a 20 fold increase in event statistics of 200 gev @xmath1 data compared to the 2006 200 gev data .",
    "in addition , the anti-@xmath27 algorithm with jet resolution parameter r = 0.6 was used to reconstruct jets .",
    "the anti-@xmath27 algorithm is less susceptible to diffuse soft backgrounds from underlying event and pile - up effects compared to the mid - point cone algorithm.@xcite a change in the treatment of hadronic energy depositions in the bemc and eemc led to an improvement in the jet momentum resolution from 23% to 18% .",
    "the statistical error bars of the 2009 results are at least a factor of four smaller than those of the 2006 results at low jet @xmath28 and a factor of three smaller at high jet @xmath28 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ f1],@xcite the @xmath0 results fall among several recent model predictions.@xcite@xcite the @xmath0 measurements fall above the old dssv prediction but well within the previous quoted uncertainty .",
    "the recently released dssv14 results with the 2009 data give @xmath29 for @xmath5 at 90% confidence limit.@xcite the nnpdf group has also included the 2009 results into their fits .",
    "they find @xmath8 = @xmath30 at @xmath31 together with a significantly reduced uncertainty band on @xmath32.@xcite     vs. @xmath28 in two @xmath20 ranges , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , compared to several recent global analysis predictions.@xcite [ f1],scaledwidth=60.0% ]    in 2012 , star performed the first measurements of inclusive jet @xmath0 in 510 gev @xmath1 collisions .",
    "the anti-@xmath27 algorithm with jet resolution parameter r = 0.5 was used to reconstruct jets .",
    "the smaller jet resolution parameter 0.5 features reduced backgrounds from underlying event and pile - up effects and better matching probabilities from detector jets to parton jets .",
    "the parton jet @xmath28 uncertainty is dominated by the total bemc energy uncertainty .",
    "the dominant systematics in the 2012 @xmath0 arise from trigger and reconstruction biases , which were estimated with the monte carlo simulations .",
    "the systematics from non - collision background and residual transverse polarization are found to be negligible .",
    "the relative luminosity uncertainty is estimated as 4 @xmath35 .",

    "[ f2 ] , the 2012 510 gev data are plotted with the 2009 200 gev data as a function of @xmath36 .",
    "the two sets of data are consistent with each other in the overlapping @xmath37 region .",
    "the higher @xmath24 extends gluon helicity measurements to lower @xmath4 .",
    "star is also performing @xmath12 measurements to explore gluon polarization in the proton .",
    "it is convenient to reconstruct @xmath12 by measuring @xmath38 from @xmath12 decay .",
    "the @xmath38s are detected by the bemc , eemc and fms over a wide @xmath20 coverage .",

    "[ f4 ] shows the 2006 inclusive @xmath12 results.@xcite the statistical precision of the 2006 data is not sufficient to discriminate among different models for @xmath8 .",

    "the projected statistical uncertainty is less than 0.015 across the entire @xmath12 @xmath28 range .",
    "the higher beam energy also will extend the sensitivity to the lower @xmath4 gluon helicity density .",
    "new measurements at further forward pseudo - rapidity with the fms are discussed in another article of this journal.@xcite     at @xmath40.@xcite [ f4],scaledwidth=70.0% ]",
    "di - jet measurements at star permit event - by - event calculations of @xmath45 and @xmath46 at leading order .",

    "[ f5].@xcite both results agree well with nlo pqcd calculations with corrections for hadronization and underlying event .",

    "the 510 gev di - jet @xmath0 with large statistics from the 2012 and 2013 data is being analyzed now .",
    "star plans to triple the statistics of the existing 200 gev data after the 2015 rhic run .",
    "it is anticipated that the new results will significantly reduce the uncertainty for 200 gev @xmath0 relative to the 2009 200 gev results , a factor of about two at jet @xmath47 gev .",
    "star also plans to install a forward calorimeter system ( fcs ) around 2020 .",
    "the fcs will enable to measure one or both of di - jets in the forward region @xmath48 . at @xmath49 gev , with one jet in eemc and one jet in fcs , @xmath0 measurements will access the gluon helicity density down to @xmath50 . with both jets in fcs , they access the gluon helicity density at @xmath4 below @xmath51",
