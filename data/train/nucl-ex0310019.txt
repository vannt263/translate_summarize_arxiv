    "[ lattice]b the relation between the transition temperature and the chemical potential from recent lattice calculations  @xcite is shown .",
    "the calculation indicates that the transition temperature decreases with increasing @xmath3 and furthermore that at low @xmath3 the transition from the hadronic phase to the qgp is a rapid crossover ( dotted line ) while at large @xmath3 a first order transition should take place ( full line ) .",
    "heavy - ion physics entered a new era with the advent of the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory .",

    "heavy ions are extended objects and the system created in a head - on collision is different from that in a peripheral collision . therefore , collisions are categorized by their centrality . theoretically the centrality is characterized by the impact parameter * b * which , however , is not a direct observable .",
    "experimentally , the collision centrality can be inferred from the measured particle multiplicities if one assumes that this multiplicity is a monotonic function of * b * ( see fig .",

    "another way to determine the event centrality is to measure the energy carried by the spectator nucleons ( which do not participate in the reaction ) with zero degree calorimetry ( zdc ) , shown in fig .",

    "a large ( small ) signal in the zdcs thus indicates a peripheral ( central ) collision .    _ ]    two other measures of the centrality which are often used are the number of wounded nucleons and the equivalent number of binary collisions .",

    ". such disappearance of the away - side jets is expected in the case of very strong energy loss in a dense medium .",
    "all these observations , taken together , are consistent with the creation of a very dense and strongly interacting system in heavy - ion collisions at rhic energies .",
    "while all these observations are consistent with the creation of a qgp , more detailed knowledge of qcd at high densities and temperatures is required .",
