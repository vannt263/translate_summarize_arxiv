    "rna interference ( rnai ) is a natural biochemical process , in which small rna molecules deactivate ( or `` silence '' ) genes inside cells . biotechnological advances of the past decade allow scientists to exploit the rnai mechanism and deactivate specific genes of their choosing , by introducing into cells appropriately designed rnai molecules .",
    "rnai technology has thus become a powerful tool that revolutionized biomedical and genetic research . for reviews ,",
    "see @xcite . an important application of rnai technology is in gene function studies whose goal is to discover which gene  henceforth termed _ the target gene _",
    " is related to a specific cell phenotype of interest .",
    "in such a study , the experimenter can deactivate a candidate gene using the appropriate rnai construct , and then observe whether the phenotype is altered ; when it is , a relationship between the two is established .",
    "however , since the organisms under study typically have many thousands of genes , genome - wide rnai experiments of this type are often too expensive and laborious to be carried out on a gene - by - gene basis .",
    "an alternative is _ pooled _ rnai screens , whereby a large number of rnai constructs of various types ( i.e. , corresponding to various genes ) are inserted randomly into a large population of cells .",
    "we refer to a cell with at least one construct deactivating the target gene as a _ target cell_. all cells then undergo selection based on the phenotype , and the abundance of each rnai construct type among the selected cells is measured .",
    "if the selection favors cells _ not _ exhibiting the phenotype ( so - called negative selection ) , it will result in enrichment of the target cells , and hence in a relatively high count of the rnai constructs corresponding to the target gene .",
    "a small number of genes exhibiting high rnai counts ( say , the three genes corresponding to the three highest counts ) can then be validated in separate , individual ( i.e. , not pooled ) rnai experiments , in the hope that the target gene is among them .",
    "conversely , under positive selection , some low - count genes need to be validated .    in most pooled rnai screens , the phenotype of interest directly influences the survivability of the cells , so that the desired selection takes place automatically as a result of inserting the rnai constructs into the cells .",
    "when this is not the case , it is sometimes possible to couple the phenotype with fluorescence , as measured in a flow cytometry experiment ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in such an experiment , the cells are processed by a fluorescence - activated cell sorter ( facs ) , which first excites fluorescent - labeled molecules harbored in them , and then sorts the cells into two categories according to the resulting fluorescence intensity .",
    "the coupling means that the cells in which the target gene was deactivated ( the target cells ) tend to exhibit stronger fluorescence , so the entire process results in enrichment of the target cells",
    ". the relative abundance of the various construct types among the selected cells can then be measured , and a small number of genes corresponding to the top counts can be further validated , as described above .    in this work we model probabilistically and optimize this facs - aided pooled rnai experiment . the main decision point in our analysis",
    "concerns the facs selection criterion : if too many cells pass the selection , no detectable signal for the target gene will emanate from the construct counts ; if the selection is too stringent , few or no target cells will be selected , resulting again in a failure to discover the target gene .    several studies described statistical methodologies for analyzing rnai experiments @xcite .",
    "our approach differs from those pursued in these studies , in that it models probabilistically the experiment starting from its fundamentals ( e.g. , the distribution of the number of constructs inserted to a cell , and the distribution of a cell s fluorescence intensity ) , rather than being data driven .",
    "this approach allows us to study analytically how changing the facs selection criterion affects the probability of discovering the target gene , and thus to optimize the process with respect to this probability .",
    "let @xmath0 be the number of genes considered . these genes may constitute the entire genome of the organism under study , or some sizable subset thereof ( e.g. , all genes related to signaling pathways ) .",
    "we index the genes by @xmath1 , and , without loss of generality , designate the index @xmath2 to the target gene .",
    "let @xmath3 be the number of cells sorted by facs , indexed by @xmath4 .",
    "in a typical experiment @xmath0 is in the thousands and @xmath3 is in the millions .    define @xmath5 to be the number of constructs of type @xmath6 inserted into cell @xmath7 , so that the target cells ( those in which the target gene was deactivated ) are those satisfying @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath9 be the fluorescence intensity of cell @xmath7 , and denote by @xmath10 and @xmath11 the cumulative distribution functions ( cdfs ) of the fluorescence intensity of the target and non - target cells , respectively .",
    "then , @xmath12 it is assumed that @xmath10 is larger than @xmath11 in some sense ( e.g. , via the usual stochastic order , whereby @xmath13 for all @xmath14 ) . also define @xmath15    the experimenter may define the facs selection criterion either through a percentile ( i.e. , the selected cells are the top @xmath16 percents of the cells , in terms of their fluorescence intensity , for some @xmath17 ) or through a fixed threshold ( i.e. , the selected cells are those whose fluorescence intensity exceeds some threshold @xmath18 ) .",
    "the latter criterion is more tractable mathematically , so we adopt it henceforth .",
    "the resulting _ construct count _ corresponding to gene @xmath6 is therefore @xmath19 the analysis below relies on the behavior of @xmath20 , which is the contribution of cell @xmath7 to the construct count @xmath21 .",
    "we consider two models for the process of inserting the rnai constructs into the cells : the multinomial model , which is simpler to analyze , and the poisson model , which is more realistic .      in the multinomial model it is assumed that each cell always admits a single construct , so that @xmath22 for each cell @xmath4 .",
    "the type of the construct in each cell is equally likely to be any of the @xmath0 possible construct types , independent of other cells .",
    "define @xmath23 to be the number of cells not selected by the facs .",

    "each cell admits a poisson number of constructs , with parameter @xmath29 that is called `` multiplicity of infection . ''",
    "the value of @xmath29 is typically low , in the range 0.11 , and we treat it as exogenously given , rather than as a decision variable . as in the multinomial model , the type of each construct",
    "is assumed to be drawn uniformly from @xmath30 , independent of other constructs . because the support of the poisson distribution includes the value 0",
    ", a cell may contain no constructs , in which case it will contribute no useful information for the experiment . to avoid this , in the second step ,",
    "all cells having no constructs are eliminated , and only those with at least one construct are processed by the facs machine .",

    "<S> we study mathematically a method for discovering which gene is related to a cell phenotype of interest . </S>",
    "<S> the method is based on rna interference  a molecular process for gene deactivation  and on coupling the phenotype with fluorescence in a facs machine . </S>",
    "<S> a small number of candidate genes are thus isolated , and then tested individually . </S>",
    "<S> we model probabilistically this process , prove a limit theorem for its outcome , and derive operational guidelines for maximizing the probability of successful gene discovery . </S>"
