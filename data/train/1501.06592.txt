    "the exchange of water around solvated ions is a key step in biochemical processes such as reactions at protein surfaces,@xcite and in geochemical processes such as the deposition of clays and minerals from aqueous solutions@xcite and the absorption of contaminants by minerals in soil.@xcite in all three of these examples , understanding the seemingly simple reaction    @xmath0    is a prerequisite for understanding much more complex processes .",
    "a great deal of work has therefore been done on this water exchange reaction . in particular , the mean residence time ( mrt ) , @xmath1 , of water in the hydration shells of ions  or equivalently its reciprocal , the exchange rate @xmath2  has been the subject of numerous experimental and computational studies.@xcite when the exchange is slow enough , the mrt can be inferred from nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) measurements.@xcite when the exchange is faster , nmr only provides an upper bound on the residence time , which can be reduced to a 100 ps upper bound with an incoherent quasi - elastic neutron scattering experiment.@xcite shorter ( sub 10 ps ) residence times have also recently been measured more precisely for certain anions by two - dimensional infrared spectroscopy.@xcite    one popular computational route to the mrt was suggested by impey _ _ et al.__@xcite : @xmath1 can be calculated as the decay time of a residence correlation function .",
    "this method , often denoted `` direct simulation '' , relies on being able to observe exchange events in a simulation , so can not be used if @xmath1 is too long . however , for most monovalent and monatomic ions , @xmath1 is on the order of 10 ps or less@xcite ( with the exception of li@xmath3 , for which values as high as 400 ps have been reported@xcite ) , and the calculation of the mrt in this way is generally viable . a similar hydrogen - bond correlation function , introduced by luzar and chandler,@xcite has also been used to calculate residence times of water in the first hydration shells of anions.@xcite an alternative method was introduced by rey and hynes,@xcite who treated the escape of water from the first hydration shell of the ion as an activated chemical process with rate constant @xmath4 , calculated using the method of reactive flux .",
    "this has the advantage that there are no restrictions on the magnitude of @xmath1 , allowing the study of exchanges that are too slow for the direct simulation method.@xcite    there are several other methods that have been used to calculate @xmath1 : a few _ ab initio _ studies of water exchange have found the mrt by counting the number of exchange events per unit time.@xcite unlike the direct simulation method , this does not require the fitting of a correlation function to an exponential decay , so may be advantageous when this fitting is problematic .",
    "laage and hynes@xcite also proposed calculating @xmath1 using the stable - states picture of chemical reactions , which is similar to the reactive flux method , but can also be used if the mrt does not reach a plateau value . finally , kerisit and rosso@xcite used transition path sampling ( tps ) to calculate @xmath1 for water around na@xmath3 and fe@xmath5 ; this technique is more general than the reactive flux method because it does not require a pre - defined reaction coordinate .    by itself ,",
    "the rate constant gives no information about the water exchange mechanism .",
    "it can , however , be used to obtain the activation volume ( the difference in volume between reactant and transition state ) , which can be used to shed more light on the process .",
    "this is defined as    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the inverse temperature and @xmath8 the pressure .",
    "@xmath9 suggests an associative mechanism ( with an intermediate that has a higher coordination number than the reactant or product ) , and @xmath10 a dissociative mechanism ( whose intermediate has a lower coordination number).@xcite the activation volume can be probed experimentally using variable - pressure nmr,@xcite although this technique has not been applied to solutions of monovalent ions , whose water exchange rates are too fast for water in the hydration shell to be distinguished from that in the bulk .",

    "_ studied how quantum fluctuations affect the solvent relaxation following a sudden jump in the charge of a neutral solute , as in an electron or proton transfer.@xcite they found that in quantum mechanical simulations , the water relaxed more rapidly . the quantum effect on mrts around several halide ions",
    "was recently investigated by habershon , who found that the classical @xmath1 was up to 40% larger than the quantum @xmath1 , the ratio decreasing with increasing ion size.@xcite however , this paper used the rigid - body spc / e water model , and it has been established that neglecting flexibility and anharmonicity in the o ",
    "h bond can lead to an overestimation of the significance of quantum effects.@xcite a rigid - body water model allows for quantum effects in the intermolecular motion , but it does not allow for quantum effects in the intramolecular motion , which tend to operate in the opposite direction .",
    "a clear example of these competing effects is provided by the self - diffusion in liquid water.@xcite on one hand , zero point energy in the intermolecular modes of the liquid assists the breaking of hydrogen bonds and speeds up the diffusion . on the other , zero - point energy in the ( anharmonic ) o  h stretch increases both the average o ",
    "h bond length and the molecular dipole moment , strengthening the hydrogen bonds and slowing down the diffusion .",
    "the net increase in the diffusion coefficient on including nqes is therefore smaller for a flexible water model than a rigid - body water model.@xcite    the results of the competition between intermolecular and intramolecular nqes can be subtle : li _ et al . _",
    "have found that hydrogen bonds weaker than those in pure water are further weakened by nqes , while stronger hydrogen bonds are strengthened.@xcite in terms of water exchange , this leads to the interesting possibility that , if the water - fluoride hydrogen bond is strong enough , quantum effects will strengthen it , making it more difficult for water to leave the first hydration shell of the anion .",
    "this would give a quantum mechanical residence time larger than the classical one .",
    "in this paper , we investigate this possibility , and also explore the quantum effect on the mrt in the first coordination shell of a cation , by looking at the water exchange dynamics around li@xmath3and f@xmath12using classical molecular dynamics and ring polymer molecular dynamics ( rpmd).@xcite",
    "the reason for focussing on these two ions is that they are the lightest in their groups and they also have the strongest interactions with their hydration shells : they are therefore the ions for which nqes are expected to be largest among the alkalis and halides . having found the quantum effect on @xmath1 , we also look at the mechanism of the exchange in the two cases , and investigate the quantum effect on the mechanism by analyzing trajectories .",
    "the remainder of this paper is set out as follows : section [ sec : methods ] describes the models we have used for the ion - water interactions , as well as the various methods we have used for calculating the rate and mechanism of water exchange ; section [ sec : results ] describes the results of our simulations and discusses the various quantum effects observed ; and section [ sec : conclusions ] concludes the paper .",
    "we used the flexible q - tip4p / f potential to describe the interactions between water molecules.@xcite this model is specifically designed for use in path integral simulations , in which it successfully captures several thermodynamic , structural , and dynamical properties of liquid water , including its density , o  o , o  h and h  h radial distribution functions ( rdfs ) , and self - diffusion coefficient.@xcite the polarizability of the water molecules is not included explicitly in the q - tip4p / f model , and we chose to treat the ion - water interactions in the same way .",
    "as small ions ,",
    "li@xmath3and f@xmath12have small polarizabilities,@xcite so a non - polarizable model which takes polarization effects into account in a mean - field manner should be sufficient , especially since our goal here is simply to assess the importance of nqes in the hydration of the two ions .",
    "these effects are rather small , so the use of a simple potential energy function that permits the collection of good statistics is of paramount importance .",
    "a polarizable water model would almost certainly be better for making quantitative comparisons with experiments,@xcite but that is not our aim here .",
    "there are many non - polarizable ion - water interaction potentials available in the literature , and several different sets of experimental target data to which they have been parameterized.@xcite two popular choices of target data are the standard free energy of hydration , @xmath13 , and the position @xmath14 of the first maximum in the ion - oxygen rdf.@xcite we have used these two pieces of experimental data to parameterize our models , and shall describe how they were calculated for each ion in sec .",

    "the quantum and classical transmission coefficients @xmath87 , recrossing - corrected rate coefficients @xmath99 , and mean residence times @xmath68 , are also given in table [ tab : mrts ] . according to our rpmd calculations , the mrt of water in the first hydration shell of li@xmath3is 118 ps , and in the first shell of f@xmath12 ,",
    "31 ps . there are no experimental results with which we can directly compare these values , but neutron scattering experiments suggest that @xmath100 ps for both ions.@xcite for f@xmath12 , our results are comfortably within this bound , while for li@xmath3the imprecision in the experimental result makes our value reasonable .",
    "the mrts of li@xmath3from earlier computational studies span two orders of magnitude , with values from 25 - 400 ps reported,@xcite while those of f@xmath12are in the 17 - 25 ps range.@xcite      the mean residence times calculated by fitting the residence correlation function @xmath75 to an exponential decay are given in the final column of table [ tab : mrts ] .",
    "they compare reasonably well with the results of our rate theory calculations , which gives us confidence in our calculated values .",
    "similar agreement between the two methods was also found by spngberg _ _ et al.__@xcite and by kerisit and rosso.@xcite    to complement our calculations of @xmath1 , fig .",
    "[ fig : direct_sim ] shows the average ion - water distance for the leaving water molecule and for its replacement during an exchange event . from this",
    ", we can classify the mechanism of exchange around the ion .",
    "according to langford and gray,@xcite ligand exchanges may be associative , a ( in which the initial step is the attachment of the replacing ligand ) , dissociative , d ( in which the initial step is the detachment of a ligand ) , or interchange , i ( with the ligands exchanging in a concerted fashion ) .",
    "this latter mechanism can be further split up depending on whether it has more associative or dissociative character ( i@xmath101 and i@xmath102 respectively ) .",
    "using these classifications , we look first at exchange around li@xmath3 : the leaving and replacing water molecules cross within the first solvation shell , but the leaving molecule has begun its exit from the shell by the time they cross .",
    "this corresponds to an associative interchange ( i@xmath103 ) mechanism , which agrees with the results of spngberg _",
    "et al._,@xcite who found that the majority of exchanges around li@xmath3had an associative nature ( either a or i@xmath101 ) .",
    "the activation volumes calculated in the literature are negative , which also points to an a or i@xmath101 mechanism.@xcite    for f@xmath12 , averaging over all exchange events suggests that the two molecules cross outside the shell , but very close to its boundary , in a dissociative interchange ( i@xmath102 ) mechanism .",
    "however , heuft and meijer found that exchange around f@xmath12proceeds via two pathways , one of which is associative and the other dissociative.@xcite to investigate whether the same was true for our model , and the behaviour in fig .",
    "[ fig : direct_sim ] was thus an average of two mechanisms , we took each individual event and classified it as associative or dissociative , based on whether the molecules crossed inside or outside of the first shell .",
    "we found that about half of the events were associative , and half dissociative , suggesting that there are indeed two pathways to exchange . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fluoride_dists ] we show the distances of the entering and leaving molecules from f@xmath12 , separately averaged over the associative and the dissociative exchanges .",
    "the distinction between the two is clear - cut : in both mechanisms , which are classified as i@xmath101 and i@xmath102 respectively , the molecules cross further from the first shell boundary than in fig .  [",
    "fig : direct_sim ] . repeating the analysis for li@xmath3",
    ", we found that fewer than 3% of the exchanges had any dissociative character , so exchange around this ion can safely be described as associative .    in both figs .",
    "[ fig : direct_sim ] and [ fig : fluoride_dists ] , the results of our trpmd simulations are compared to those of classical md .",
    "it is evident that , once again , the difference between the quantum and classical simulations is minimal . coupled with our results from previous sections , we see that the overall effect of quantum fluctuations on water exchange around these two ions is very small .",
    "quantum fluctuations do slightly enhance the rate of water exchange in both cases , by @xmath104% for f@xmath82 and @xmath105% for li@xmath81 ( see table  iii ) , but this enhancement can be traced almost entirely to the reduced barrier heights of the quantum mechanical potentials of mean force in fig .  4 .",
    "quantum effects have very little impact on either the time - dependent transmission coefficients in fig .  5 or the average reactive trajectories in figs .",
    "6 and  7 .",
    "presumably this is because these are determined by the dynamics at configurations on either side of the exchange barrier , where there is hardly any difference between the quantum and classical potentials of mean force ( see fig .  4 ) .",
    "there is still one remaining aspect of our results that needs explaining .",
    "we have shown that nuclear quantum effects decrease the mrt of water in the first coordination shell of f@xmath12by only @xmath104% , which is considerably smaller than the 40% decrease found by habershon.@xcite we shall now establish that this is because of the competing quantum effects that are present in our simulations : the o  h@xmath106f@xmath12hydrogen bond is strengthened by zero - point energy in the anharmonic o ",
    "h stretch , and weakened by zero - point energy in perpendicular directions .",

    "if this is greater for the h atoms hydrogen - bonded to f@xmath12than the h atoms in bulk water , the former will be more confined and have a higher zero - point energy than those in the bulk.@xcite what makes this especially useful is that @xmath111 can be resolved into contributions from motion in three orthogonal directions , which provides a very natural way to separate the competing quantum effects.@xcite    as in ref . , we calculated the centroid virial estimator@xcite for the kinetic energy tensor , @xmath112 , for each h atom in each snapshot of our pimd simulation .",
    "we then found the rotation that minimized the mean - square difference between the water molecule containing the h atom and a reference molecule , and applied this rotation to the kinetic energy tensor , so as to obtain the tensor in the molecular frame .",
    "the resulting tensors were averaged over the simulation for three different groups of h atoms : those in the first hydration shell hydrogen - bonded to f@xmath12 , those in the first hydration shell not hydrogen - bonded to f@xmath82 , and those in the remainder of the solution ( described here as bulk ) . for each of these species ,",
    "the averaged tensor @xmath113 was then diagonalised to obtain its eigenvalues @xmath114 and the corresponding eigenvectors .",
    "table [ tab : ketensor ] reports the total kinetic energies @xmath115 and their components @xmath114 for each of the three types of h atom . in all cases ,",
    "the components are considerably larger than the classical expectation value of @xmath116 mev , because of the significant amount of zero - point energy in o  h bonds .",
    "one sees that the total kinetic energy @xmath111 differs appreciably from its bulk value only for those atoms directly hydrogen - bonded to the fluoride ion .",
    "@xmath117 , the component in the o  h direction , has decreased from its value in bulk water , indicating a decrease in confinement in this direction due to stretching of the bond to facilitate hydrogen bonding . on the other hand , @xmath118 and @xmath119 , the components perpendicular to the o ",
    "h bond , have increased , reflecting more confinement in these directions due to the stronger hydrogen - bonding interaction of h with the f@xmath12ion than with the oxygen atoms of other water molecules .",
    "this is a clear indication of competing quantum effects .",
    "the net result is that @xmath111 is larger by 4.2 mev@xmath120 for the h atoms hydrogen bonded to f@xmath82 than the h atoms in bulk water .",
    "the first solvation shell of the f@xmath82 is therefore destabilised slightly by quantum effects , which is consistent with the slight ( @xmath104% ) reduction in the mrt of the water molecules in this shell we have found in our simulations . without allowing for the anharmonicity of the o ",
    "h bond , the decrease in the @xmath117 component between the bulk and the first solvation shell would be expected to be smaller , resulting in a larger increase in both @xmath111 and the exchange rate on including nqes , as habershon found in his simulations.@xcite    table [ tab : ketensor ] also compares the components of @xmath111 for h atoms in the first shell of li@xmath3with those in the bulk .",
    "the total kinetic energy is the same in both environments , though there is a small difference in the individual components : as for f@xmath12 , @xmath117 is smaller in the first shell , while @xmath118 and @xmath119 are larger .",
    "however , in this case the kinetic energy of the h atoms does not play any part in explaining the quantum effect on the exchange rate , since the h atoms do not participate in hydrogen bonding with the ion .",
    "our results for li@xmath81 are in agreement with the results of videla _",
    "et al._,@xcite who found that the spatial delocalization of h atoms in the first solvation shells of cations was very similar to that in bulk water . from the point of view of the h atom kinetic energy ,",
    "there is certainly very little distinction between the two environments .",
    "the correlation between halide - water binding strengths and quantum effect on mrts has been attributed to greater zero - point energy in more strongly bound systems.@xcite since li@xmath3and f@xmath12interact differently with their first hydration shells , it is not immediately clear whether or not this factor contributes to the larger quantum effect for the former . for this reason ,",
    "we have also used transition state theory to look at water exchange around water .",
    "this molecule interacts with its first shell as both a hydrogen bond donor and acceptor , so is in this sense intermediate between the two ions .",
    "computing the pmf for this exchange using md and pimd simulations with 216 water molecules , we found a barrier height of 1.4 @xmath86 , even smaller than that for f@xmath12(3.4 @xmath86 ) . in a similar vein , @xmath95 is equal to 1.61 ps@xmath43 classically and 1.69 ps@xmath43 quantum mechanically : this increase of 5% is also smaller than the 9% found in sec .",
    "[ subsec : ratetheory ] for f@xmath12 .",
    "this lends support to the suggestion that , regardless of the mode of solvent - solute binding , more strongly bound solvent molecules lead to a greater nuclear quantum effect on @xmath1 .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the impact of nuclear quantum effects on the static and dynamical properties of water in aqueous solutions of li@xmath3and f@xmath12ions using classical and path integral molecular dynamics techniques .",
    "we have found that for both ions , quantization causes a small destabilization of the first hydration shell , leading to a shorter mean residence time for the water molecules in this shell .",
    "this is explained in both cases by a net disruption of the hydrogen bonding on the inclusion of zero - point energy . the effect is greater for li@xmath81 than for f@xmath82 for two reasons : li@xmath81 interacts more strongly with the water molecules in its first hydration shell , and there is a competition between quantum effects in the o ",
    "h@xmath106f@xmath12hydrogen bond as discussed in sec .",
    "since an essential ingredient in this competition is the anharmonicity of the o  h bond,@xcite it is missed in simulations of rigid - body water molecules , which explains the difference between our results for fluoride and those of ref . .",
    "we have also found that the mechanism of water exchange around both ions , exemplified by the trajectories of the leaving and replacing molecules , is practically unchanged by nuclear quantum effects .",
    "the real upshot of our results is thus that classical simulations provide a qualitative , and even semiquantitative , description of the water exchange dynamics . since quantum effects",
    "have been seen to diminish with weaker ion - water binding , the li@xmath3and f@xmath12ions bind water the most strongly in their respective groups , and they are also the lightest elements in their groups , we would expect this to be true for all alkalis and halides .",
    "the classical treatment of the nuclear motion in most previous work on water exchange around these ions is therefore justified .",
