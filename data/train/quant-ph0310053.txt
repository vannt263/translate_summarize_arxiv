    "two - level quantum systems , denoted qubits , have gained a renewed interest in the past ten years , owing to the fascinating perspectives of quantum information@xcite . having in mind the different qubit manipulation protocols that are proposed in this growing field , it is therefore of high interest to represent their quantum evolution in a suitable representation space , in order to get some insight into the subtleties of this complicated problem . for single two - level systems ,",
    "a well known tool in quantum optics is the bloch sphere representation , where the simple qubit state is faithfully represented , up to a global phase , by a point on a standard sphere @xmath0 , whose coordinates are expectation values of physically interesting operators for the given quantum state .",
    "guided by the relation between the bloch sphere and a geometric object called the hopf fibration of the @xmath1hypersphere@xcite , a generalization for a two - qubit system was recently proposed@xcite , in the framework of the ( high dimensional ) @xmath2 sphere hopf fibration , and will be recalled below .",
    "an interesting result is that the @xmath2 hopf fibration is entanglement sensitive and therefore provides a kind of stratification  for the 2 qubits states space with respect to their entanglement content .",
    "an extension of this description to a three qubits system , using the @xmath3 hopf fibration , will also be presented here .",
    "we first briefly remind known facts about the bloch sphere representation , and its close relation to the @xmath4 hopf fibration .",
    "we then recall in some details what was recently done for the two - qubit case in terms of the @xmath2 hopf fibration .",
    "the @xmath3 hopf fibration is then introduced , which helps describing the three - qubits hilbert space geometry .",
    "as far as computation is concerned , going from the @xmath4 to the @xmath2 and then the @xmath3 fibrations merely amounts to replacing complex numbers by quaternions and then octonions .",
    "this is why a brief introduction to quaternions and octonions is given in appendix .",
    "note that using these two kinds of generalized numbers is not strictly necessary here , but they provide an elegant way to put the calculations into a compact form , and have ( by nature ) a natural geometrical interpretation",
    "a ( single ) qubit state reads @xmath6    in the spin @xmath7 context , the orthonormal basis @xmath8 are the two eigenvectors of the ( say ) @xmath9 ( pauli spin ) operator . viewed as pairs of real numbers , the two normalized components @xmath10 generate a unit radius sphere s@xmath5 embedded in * * r**@xmath11 . to take into account the global phase freedom ,",
    "one expects to find a way to fill s@xmath5 with circles ( the orbit of a global phase @xmath12 multiplying the pair ( @xmath10 ) ) , such that each state belongs to exactly one such circle .",
    "this task is nicely fulfilled by the so - called s@xmath5 hopf fibration @xcite .    a fibred space @xmath13 is defined by a ( many - to - one ) map from @xmath13 to the so - called base space , all points of a given fibre @xmath14 being mapped onto a single base point .",
    "a fibration is said `` trivial '' if the base @xmath15 can be embedded in the fibred space @xmath13 , the latter being faithfully described as the direct product of the base and the fibre ( think for instance of fibrations of @xmath16 by parallel lines @xmath17 and base @xmath18 or by parallel planes @xmath18 and base @xmath17 ) .",
    "the simplest , and most famous , example of a non trivial fibration is the hopf fibration of @xmath4 by great circles @xmath19 and base space @xmath0 .",
    "for the qubit hilbert space purpose , the fibre represents the global phase degree of freedom , and the base @xmath0 is identified to the bloch sphere .",
    "one standard notation for a fibred space is that of a map @xmath20 , which reads here @xmath21 .",
    "its non trivial character implies @xmath22 .",
    "this translates into the known failure in ascribing consistantly a definite phase to each representing point on the bloch sphere .    to describe this fibration in an analytical form , we go back to the definition of @xmath4 as pairs of complex numbers @xmath23 which satisfy @xmath24 .",
    "the hopf map is defined as the composition of a map @xmath25 from @xmath4 to @xmath18 @xmath26 , followed by an inverse stereographic map @xmath27from @xmath18 to @xmath28 @xmath29{ccc}% s^{3 } & \\longrightarrow & r^{2}+\\left\\ {   \\infty\\right\\ } \\\\ \\left (   \\alpha,\\beta\\right )   & \\longrightarrow & c=\\overline{\\alpha\\beta^{-1}}% \\end{array } \\qquad\\alpha,\\beta\\in\\mathbb{c}\\nonumber\\\\ h_{2 }   &   : % \\begin{array } [ c]{ccc}% r^{2}+\\left\\ {   \\infty\\right\\ }   & \\longrightarrow & s^{2}\\\\ c & \\longrightarrow & m(x , y , z ) \\end{array } \\qquad x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=1\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath30 is the complex conjugate of @xmath31 ) .",
    "the first map @xmath25 clearly shows that the full @xmath4 great circle , parametrized by ( @xmath32 ) , is mapped onto the same single point with complex coordinate @xmath33 .",
    "it is easy to show that , with @xmath18 cutting the unit radius @xmath0 along the equator , and the north pole ( along the @xmath34 axis ) as the stereographic projection pole , the @xmath0 hopf fibration base coordinates coincide with the well known @xmath0 bloch sphere coordinates : @xmath35    this correspondance between hopf map and bloch sphere is not new @xcite , but is poorly known in both communities ( quantum optics and geometry ) .",
    "it is striking that the simplest non trivial object of quantum physics , the two - level system , bears such an intimate relation with the simplest non trivial fibred space .",
    "it is tempting to try to visualize the full ( @xmath4 ) hilbert space with its fibre structure .",
    "this can be achieved by doing a ( direct ) stereographic map from @xmath4 to @xmath16 ( figure 1 ) .",
    "each @xmath4 circular fibre is mapped onto a circle in @xmath16 , with an exceptional straight line , image of the unique @xmath4 great circle passing through the projection pole .",

    "a two - qubit state reads @xmath41    @xmath42 is said separable  if it can be written as a simple product of individual kets belonging to @xmath43 and @xmath39 separately , a definition which translates into the well known following condition : @xmath44 .",

    "geometrically , this means that non - entangled states map from @xmath2 onto a 2-dimensional planar subspace of the target space @xmath53 .",

    "such an operator , which is nothing but the time reversal operator for two spins @xmath7 , is already widely used in quantifying entanglement@xcite , through a quantity called the concurrence  @xmath82 , which corresponds here to @xmath83 .",
    "let us first inverse the hopf map , and get the general expression for the set of states ( a @xmath4 sphere in @xmath2 ) which is sent to @xmath57 by the @xmath25 map .",
    "a generic such state , noted @xmath84 , reads ( given as a pair of quaternions ) @xmath85    with @xmath56 a unit quaternion spanning the @xmath4 fibre .",
    "notice that we could also write @xmath84 in a way that recall the standard spinor notation ( but here with quaternionic instead of complex components ) : @xmath86    where @xmath87 , and @xmath88 is the following unit pure imaginary quaternion : @xmath89    in order to compare with the generic expression ( [ two - qubits state ] ) , we aim to write @xmath84 as a quadruplet of complex numbers .",
    "for that purpose , we express the two unit quaternions @xmath56 and @xmath68 in terms of pairs of complex numbers , @xmath90 ( with @xmath91 ) , and @xmath92 ( with @xmath93 ) , and eventually get:@xmath94    in the above expression , @xmath95 @xmath96 and @xmath97 correspond to the base space part of the fibration .",

    "this property is clearly displayed here .",
    "the unit @xmath52 base space reduces to a unit @xmath0 sphere ( since @xmath108 which is nothing but the bloch sphere for the first qubit .",
    "the second qubit bloch sphere is then recovered from the fibre , spanned by @xmath90 .  indeed , we can iterate the fibration process on the @xmath4 fibre itself and get the ( hopf fibration base)-(bloch sphere ) coordinates for this two - level system .",
    "it is now easy to recover that this new @xmath0 base is the second qubit bloch sphere .    in summary , for non entangled qubits , the @xmath2 hopf fibration , with base @xmath52 and fibre @xmath4 ,",
    "simplifies to the simple product of a @xmath0 sub - sphere of the base ( the first qubit bloch sphere ) by a second @xmath0 ( the second qubit bloch sphere ) obtained as the base of a @xmath4 hopf fibration applied to the fibre itself .",
    "let us stress that this last iterated fibration is necessary to take into account the global phase of the two qubit system .",
    "the fact that these two @xmath0 spheres play a symmetrical role ( although one is related to the base and the other to the fibre ) can be understood in the following way .",
    "we grouped together @xmath109 and @xmath110 on one hand , and @xmath111 and @xmath112 on the other hand , to form the quaternions @xmath113 and @xmath114 , and then define the hopf map @xmath25 as the ratio of these two quaternions ( plus a complex conjugation ) . had we grouped @xmath109 and @xmath115 , and @xmath110 and @xmath112 , to form two new quaternions , and use the same definition for the hopf map , we would also get a @xmath2 hopf fibration , but differently oriented .",
    "we let as an exercise to compute the base and fibre coordinates in that case .",
    "the net effect is to interchange the role of the two qubits : the second qubit bloch sphere is now part of the @xmath52 base , while the first qubit bloch sphere is obtained from the @xmath4 fibre .",
    "let us now focus on maximally entangled states ( m.e.s . ) .",
    "they correspond to the complex number @xmath116 having maximal norm @xmath117 ( unit concurrence ) .",
    "this in turn implies that the hopf map base reduces to a unit circle in the plane @xmath118 , parametrized by the unit complex number @xmath119 . the projective hilbert space for these m.e.s .",
    "is known to be @xmath120 a @xmath4  sphere with identified opposite points @xcite ( this is linked to the fact that all m.e.s . can be related by a local operation on one sub - system , since @xmath121 ) . in order to recover this result in the present framework",
    ", one can follow the trajectory of a representative point on the base and on the fibre while the state is multiplied by an overall phase @xmath122 . the expression for @xmath123 shows that the point on the base turns by twice the angle @xmath124 . only when @xmath125 does the corresponding state belongs to the same fiber ( e.g. maps onto the same value on the base ) .",
    "the fact that the fibre is a @xmath4 sphere , and this two - to - one correspondance between the fibre and the base under a global phase change , explains the @xmath126 topology for the m.e.s .",
    "projective hilbert space .",
    "let us give now a more explicit proof of that result .",
    "m.e.s.correspond to @xmath127 and maximal concurrence ( @xmath128 ) , which leads to @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",

    "projective hilbert space .",
    "indeed , the m.e.s@xmath135 set corresponds to pairs @xmath136 , which as a whole cover a unit radius @xmath4 sphere .",
    "now , looking to the quadruplet expression ( @xmath137 opposite points @xmath138 and @xmath139 on @xmath4 clearly correspond to the same state @xmath131 ( up to a global phase ) .",
    "opposite points on @xmath4 have therefore tobe identified , leading to the @xmath126 ( @xmath140 ) structure .",
    "this one - to - one correspondance between m.e.s . and",
    "3 dimensional rotation matrices has recently led to propose using the former in an `` applied topology '' experiment @xcite : to verify experimentally the well known subtle topology of the ( two - fold connected ) @xmath141 group .",
    "the latter property is evidenced by constructing the two inequivalent family of closed paths in the geometrical manifold representing this group .",
    "this is done by choosing sequences of unitary operations on the mes two - qubits states .",
    "the non equivalence between the two paths is manifested by a @xmath142 topological phase shift which should result from an adequate interference experiment ( a twin photons experiment have been proposed , but other two - qubit states could be used ) .",
    "we are now led to consider a generalization of the bloch sphere for the two - qubit projective hilbert space .",
    "clearly , the present hopf fibration description suggests a splitting of the representation space in a product of base and fibres sub - spaces . of the base space @xmath52",
    ", we propose to only keep the first three coordinates @xmath143    all states map inside a standard ball @xmath144 of radius 1 , where the set of separable states forms the @xmath0 boundary ( the usual first qubit bloch sphere ) , and the centre corresponds to maximally entangled states .",
    "concentric spherical shells around the centre correspond to states of equal concurrence @xmath82 ( maximal at the centre , zero on the surface ) , the radius of the spherical shell being equal to @xmath145 .",
    "the idea of slicing the 2-qubit hilbert space into manifolds of equal concurrence is not new @xcite,@xcite .",
    "what is nice here is that , under the hopf map ( and a projection onto the 3d subspace of the base spanned by the first three coordinates ) , these manifolds transforms into concentric @xmath0 shells which fill the unit ball .    to each point ( @xmath146 ) , it corresponds a @xmath126 manifold , spanned by the couple ( @xmath147 ) , as seen clearly from relation ( @xmath132 ) , with an added identification of ( @xmath147 ) and ( @xmath148 ) .",
    "the natural generalization of the bloch sphere for two qubits is therefore a product of two @xmath144 balls .",
    "the first one , spanned by the triple ( @xmath146 ) , has just been described as containing the partial bloch sphere for one the two qubits , with its set of concentric iso - concurrence spheres .",
    "the second one corresponds to the standard representation of @xmath141 by a @xmath149 ball of radius @xmath142 , the double arrow sign recalling that opposite points on the boundary @xmath0 sphere have to be identified .",
    "this picture is valid for all states except the separable ones , for which the fiber derived @xmath149 space reduces to a @xmath0 sphere ( the second qubit partial bloch sphere ) .    instead of mapping the continuous set of @xmath0 spheres onto the filled ball @xmath144 in the space spanned by ( @xmath146 ) ,",

    "the first qubit partial bloch sphere is spanned here by the triplet @xmath202 a second proof consists in writing down the separability algebraic conditions @xcite . in the present case , the latter",
    "imply that the above generalized concurrences vanish ( in fact the six vanishing conditions only rely onto three independant conditions ) .",
    "going back to the above definition of the @xmath25 map , this means that in that case , the hopf map carries an octonion couple onto a pure complex number @xmath203 .",
    "therefore , as for two - qubits and @xmath2 , * the * @xmath204**hopf fibration is also entanglement sensitive for three qubits * * !",
    "this result has been independantly derived by bernevig and chen@xcite .    however",
    ", one should notice an important difference between the two- and three - qubit cases .",
    "in the two - qubit case , the @xmath2 hopf fibration have allowed us to foliate the projective hilbert space with respect to state entanglement , the latter , measured by the concurrence , being simply related to the norm the restriction of the base point to the subspace spanned by the triplet @xmath205 since the base space @xmath52 has unit radius , the entanglement is therefore simply related to the radius the first qubit partial bloch sphere , spanned by the triplet @xmath206 .",
    "the first - to - second qubit distinction ( base - fibre in the fibration ) do not matter here ( to define the foliation ) since the two partial bloch sphere radii are equal .",
    "the @xmath204hopf fibration is clearly sensitive to the entanglement of one qubit ( the first qubit in the present case ) with respect to the other two qubits : the first qubit partial bloch sphere radius is still read out from the norm of the restriction of the base point to the subspace spanned by the triplet @xmath206 .",
    "however , the latter does not tell the whole story in terms of state entanglement .",
    "once you know how far qubit 1 is entangled with the remaining two , you do not yet know whether the second ( or third ) qubit is or not separated .",
    "this prevents from building a foliation driven by a single entanglement parameter .",
    "one possibility for such a foliation unique parameter would be to use the 3-tangle@xcite .",
    "but it does not distinguish among separable and entangled w states .",
    "an alternative entanglement parameter has been by suggested by bernevig and chen @xcite ( see also ref.@xcite for a related measure ) : to recover the symmetry between the three qubits , an average over the three qubits partial bloch sphere radii is used .",
    "the solution to the foliation problem might be to use three ( instead of one ) parameters , by considering three distinct @xmath204hopf fibrations , such that each of the three qubits partial bloch spheres is singled out by the first three coordinates on the base .",
    "said more simply , one may try to describe the hilbert space geometry in a space spanned by the three partial bloch sphere radii ( @xmath207 ) .",
    "since each radius belongs to the interval @xmath208   , $ ] the whole representation lies inside a unit cube .",
    "when one radius equals 1 , one qubit is separated from the other two , and the other two radii are equal .",
    "we then see that the set under consideration cuts three square faces of the cube ( such that @xmath209 along a diagonal .",
    "these diagonals corresponds to the product of a sphere @xmath0 ( the bloch sphere of the separated qubit ) , and a copy of the above foliation for the remaining two qubits .",
    "notice that the latter foliation was introduced above with respect to state entanglement , as measured by the concurrence @xmath82 , instead of the partial bloch sphere radius . to get a fully equivalent picture",
    ", one should therefore transform the original coordinate system from @xmath82 to @xmath210 .",
    "our main goal in this paper was to provide a geometrical representation of the two and three - qubit hilbert space pure states . we have shown that , as for the one - qubit bloch sphere relation to the @xmath4 hopf fibration",
    ", the more complex @xmath2 and @xmath3 hopf fibrations also play a natural role in that case .",
    "note that , as already mentionned in ref .",
    "@xcite , in the three hopf fibration sequence ( @xmath211 , the fibre in the larger dimensional space is the full space in next case .",
    "this is illustrated below :    [ ptb ]",
    "nest5.eps    this offers the possibility of further nesting the fibrations , a possibility that was already used in the present analysis of two - qubit separable case .",
    "this also applies to the three qubit case : whenever the first qubit is separated from the other two , the base reduces to the first qubit bloch sphere , and the @xmath2 fibre is precisely the hilbert space of the remaining two qubits .    in the two - qubit case , this approach has in particular allowed for a complete description of the pure state projective hilbert space , in terms of an entanglement driven foliation , with well characterized leaves .",
    "this goal has not yet been achieved in the three qubits case , although a plausible track has been proposed here .",
