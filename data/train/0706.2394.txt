    "various extensions of the gorkov theory also rely heavily on the assumption of @xmath15 being small , or the assumption of magnetic field being weak.@xcite    it is desirable to have a microscopic theory for superconductivity in a magnetic field that is valid under more general conditions . as an effort along this line , we present in this paper a theory based on a local approximation approach .",
    "the theory allows microscopic description of the suppression of superconductivity by an externally applied magnetic field .",
    "the theory is expected to be valid for highly - local superconductors ( the high - temperature copper - oxide superconductors are examples of highly - local superconductors , for which ginzburg - landau parameter @xmath14 ) for all temperatures and magnetic fields below the superconducting transition ( except , perhaps , in the high - field limit when the effect of spin paramagnetism , which is neglected in the present work , may become important ) . in the low - field limit",

    "we consider a superconductor in an applied magnetic field .",
    "our starting point is the same bcs pairing hamiltonian@xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the normal state single - electron energy , @xmath20 the fermi energy , @xmath21 the pairing interaction matrix element , and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the fermi operators of an electronic state of wave vector * k * and spin @xmath24 in the normal state .",
