    "see @xcite and references therein for the mhd effect on the ccsne .",
    "the higher the magnetic field strength and the pre - collapse rotation rate , the more mhd effect becomes important in the supernova dynamics . at the post - collapse stage , the magnetic field",
    "is amplified by two processes : one is the field wrapping ( i.e. , @xmath1-effect ) , and the other is so - called magnetorotational instability ( mri , see @xcite ) .",
    "the later is highlighted here because it can amplify the magnetic field exponentially in the differentially rotating core , much faster than the linear amplification due to the @xmath1-effect .",
    "@xcite were the first to point out that nascent protoneutron stars ( pnss ) is generally subjected to the mri .",
    "they predicted that , due to the mri , the magnetic fields of @xmath2@xmath3 g can develop after the core - bounce , which is high enough to affect the supernova dynamics .",
    "however , the nonlinear properties of the mri in the ccsne has not been fully elucidated .",
    "the short wavelength of the mri prevents from accurately capturing it in the global simulation .    to overcome this difficulty ,",
    "local models are often used .",
    "@xcite reported local shearing - disk simulations to study the nonlinear development of the mri in the supernova core , and showed that the mri amplifies the seed fields exceeding @xmath4 g as estimated in @xcite . by local shearing box calculations of a small patch of the supernova core , masada et al .",
    "( 2012 ) presented a sub - grid scale model of the mri - driven turbulence to predict the saturation amplitudes of the magnetic energy and turbulent stress .",
    "they also showed that the turbulent heating sustained by the mri might play a crucial role in facilitating the neutrino - heating mechanism ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .    only by dropping the dimension",
    ", the mri can be simulated even in the global model .",
    "a pioneering work by @xcite showed for the first time that a sub - magnetar - class magnetic field was amplified by the mri to the magnetar - class strength in the highest resolution axisymmetric global simulation to date .",
    "furthermore , @xcite found by combining the neutrino transport approximately that the angular momentum transport by the mri - amplified magnetic field contributes to the enhancement of the neutrino heating and eventually leads to neutrino - driven explosion .",
    "the aim of this letter is to comprehend , using a new semi - global model , three - dimensional ( 3d ) evolution of the mri in the collapsed - core with the global structure of mhd variables . to numerically resolve the mri with the wavelength much shorter than the global scale ,",
    "a thin layer approximation is adopted .",
    "the nonlinear evolution of the mri in the stably stratified layer around the neutrinosphere and its dependence on the magnetic flux threading the core are studied quantitatively . the mri - sustained turbulent heating and the suitable condition for it are finally discussed .",
    "to resolve the mri - unstable modes , we focus only on the equatorial region of the core and adopt a thin layer approximation with @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the radius and height of the system . in figure 1(a ) , our semi - global model is shown schematically . under this approximation ,",
    "the vertical gravity is neglected and thus the physical variables are homogeneous initially in the vertical direction .",
    "the computational domain covers @xmath8}$ ] in the radius , @xmath9 in the azimuth , and @xmath10}$ ] in the height .",
    "the cylindrical structure of the thin - layer approximated supernova core is mapped onto the cartesian domain with @xmath11 and @xmath12 to avoid the coordinate singularity .",
    "the fundamental equations are compressible mhd equations written by @xmath13 with @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the specific internal energy , @xmath16 is the current density , and @xmath17 is the strain rate tensor . the viscosity and magnetic diffusivity are represented by @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "we employ the equation of state based on the relativistic mean - field theory ( shen et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "we set an initial equilibrium model based on a post - bounce core from an axisymmetric hydrodynamic simulation of rotating core - collapse ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for the method ) .",
    "about @xmath20 ms after the core bounce , the shock wave has reached @xmath21 km , and the post - shocked region is settled into a quasi - hydrostatic structure . the radial distribution of the hydrodynamic variable along the equator of the simulation is extracted , and the stratified supernova core is reconstructed within our model . by assuming the gravity force balancing with the pressure gradient and centrifugal forces , a cylindrically symmetric hydrostatic structure is retained .",
    "the radial profiles of the density , entropy , and angular velocity adopted as the initial setting are shown in figure 1(b ) by red solid , blue dashed , and purple dash - dotted lines .",
    "they are normalized by their maximum values ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) .",

    "the profile of the electron fraction @xmath29 is assumed to be constant with time from the initial value because neutrino transport is not solved .",
    "the convective stability is thus determined only by the entropy gradient .",
    "since the effect of the @xmath29-gradient on the mri is much weaker than that of the entropy gradient in the region of our interest ( @xmath30 ) , we anticipate that , at least , the conclusion of this work is independent from it .",

    "the neutrinospheres are located in the mri - unstable region initially .",
    "all the variables are assumed to be periodic in the vertical direction , whereas stress - free and perfect conductor boundary conditions are used in the horizontal direction for the velocity and magnetic fields . to reduce the artifacts due to the cartesian geometry ,",
    "the profile of the angular velocity is fixed in buffer regions denoted by gray shade in figure 1(c ) ( @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) .",
    "furthermore , we assume @xmath20 times larger magnetic diffusivity in the buffer region than that in the region of @xmath41 . the mri - driven turbulence is thus artificially quenched in the buffer region .",
    "the fundamental equations are solved by the second - order godunov - type finite - difference scheme which employs an approximate mhd riemann solver @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field is evolved with cmoc - ct method @xcite .",

    "the grid convergence of our model will be studied carefully in a subsequent paper .",

    "the delay of the mri growth in the outer mri - unstable region would be because our simulation can not sufficiently capture the most unstable mri wavelength there .",
    "panels ( b)(f ) in figure 2 present the snapshots of the radial magnetic field ( @xmath51 ) in the inner mri - unstable region on the @xmath6@xmath52 cutting plane at @xmath53@xmath54 , with the red ( blue ) tone denoting the positive ( negative ) @xmath51 . as seen in earlier studies , the evolution and disruption of the channel structure are observed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the growth of the mri in the outer region becomes prominent after @xmath55 [ green dash - dotted line in figure 2(a ) ] .",
    "since the magnetic energy stored in the outer region is small compared to the inner region , it gives a minor contribution to the total magnetic energy .",

    "intriguingly , as time advances , the mri - turbulent region spreads radially - inward [ panels ( b ) & ( c ) ] , and penetrates into the middle mri - stable region [ panel ( d ) ] . the turbulent mixing which can flatten the entropy gradient would be responsible for it . as a result ,",
    "whole the convectively stable region around the neutrinosphere is overwhelmed with the mhd turbulence .",
    "the multistage evolution of the mri can be seen also in the energy spectra . in figure 4 ,",
    "the fourier spectra of the magnetic energy , averaged over the azimuth and a given time span at ( a ) @xmath59 ( inner mri - unstable region ) , ( b ) @xmath27 ( middle mri - stable region ) , and ( c ) @xmath60 ( outer mri - unstable region ) , are shown .",
    "the horizontal axis represents the vertical wavenumber @xmath61 normalized by @xmath62 .",
    "the different lines correspond to different time spans .",
    "the black dashed line is the reference slope of @xmath63 .",
    "the magnetic energy inversely cascades from the small scale to the larger scale as time passes . in the inner mri - unstable region [ panel ( a ) ] , it begins to evolve immediately after the calculation starts and a saturated mri - turbulent state is achieved at @xmath50 .",
    "after @xmath50 , the outer mri - unstable region begins to be destabilized [ panel ( c ) ] .",
    "the middle mri - stable region is subsequently destabilized after @xmath64 and is finally settled into the turbulent state at @xmath65 [ panel ( b ) ] .",
    "the property of the saturated mri - driven turbulence is examined by varying @xmath66 from @xmath67 to @xmath68 without changing the initial equilibrium model .",
    "figure 5 ( a ) shows the @xmath28-dependence of the mean magnetic energy density @xmath69 , where the single angular brackets denote the volume average spanning in the range of @xmath70 and the additional angular brackets denote the time average in the range of @xmath71 [ @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) is @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) and @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) is @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) for all the models ] .",
    "the red circle represents the mri - turbulent model and the green cross is the model in which the mri does not grow .",
    "the orange dotted line is the reference slope with @xmath80 .",
    "the expected magnetic energy stored in the full spherical shell of @xmath70 , which is defined by @xmath81 is presented in the right axis just for the reference .    in the range @xmath82",
    ", @xmath69 is proportional to @xmath83 .",
    "this is similar to the recent studies of the mri in the stratified accretion disk ( e.g. , suzuki et al .",
    "the dependency becomes weaker with the increase of @xmath28 and @xmath84 hits the ceiling at @xmath85 in the range @xmath86 .",
    "except for the most strongly magnetized model in which the mri does not grow , whole the convectively stable region around the neutrinosphere is overwhelmed with the mhd turbulence .",
    "the upper threshold @xmath87 seems to be determined by the free energy stored in the differential rotation . by taking the initial rotation profile , the volume - averaged shear energy @xmath88 , which can be tapped for the amplification of the magnetic field ,",
    "is evaluated as @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the rotational shear ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xmath88 is presented by the blue dashed line in the panel ( a ) .",
    "there is a good agreement between @xmath87 and @xmath91 .",
    "this suggests that the convectively - stable layer around the neutrinosphere becomes fully - turbulent when the condition @xmath92 is fulfilled , where @xmath93 is the initial magnetic energy density .",
    "the most strongly magnetized model does not meet this precondition .",
    "this would be the reason why the mri - turbulence does not grow in that model .",
    "the upper threshold for the saturated magnetic energy is a main difference between the mri in ccsne and that in the accretion disk . in the supernova core",
    ", the force balance is mainly achieved between the gravity and the pressure gradient force unlike the accretion disk in which the gravity is balanced with the centrifugal force .",
    "since the free energy stored in the differential rotation is much lower than the thermal energy in the supernova core , the saturated magnetic energy is constrained predominantly by the shear energy rather than by the thermal energy .",
    "the mri - driven turbulence sustains the turbulent heating around the neutrinosphere .",
    "figure 5 ( b ) shows the @xmath28-dependence of the mri - luminosity @xmath94 , which is equivalent to the turbulent heating rate and is defined by @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the turbulent maxwell stress ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "note that the spherical symmetry is assumed here .",
    "the red circle denotes the model dominated by the mri - driven turbulence , and the green cross is the model in which the mri does not grow .",
    "@xmath94 is increased with @xmath28 in the regime @xmath97 .",
    "however , in the most strongly magnetized model , the turbulent heating is drastically suppressed because the mri - driven turbulence does not develop .",
    "this suggests that , in the rapidly rotating pns assumed in this work , the pulsar - sized relatively weak poloidal magnetic field ( @xmath98@xmath99 ) is the most suitable for the mri - sustained turbulent heating and then provides @xmath100 in the supernova core .    by extrapolating the simulation result of the rapidly rotating pns",
    ", we finally evaluate @xmath101 expected in pnss with extremely rapid rotation .",
    "when assuming @xmath102 , @xmath101 should be proportional to @xmath103 from the equation ( 12 ) .",
    "in addition , equation ( 11 ) suggests that the maximum value of @xmath28 for enabling the mri - driven turbulence is proportional to @xmath1 . according to @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the most rapidly rotating pns is expected to have @xmath104 times higher @xmath105 than that of our simulation model ( @xmath106 ) . to infer an upper bound of @xmath107",
    ", we plot the blue - dashed line in figure 5 ( b ) , which corresponds to the extrapolated model .",
    "the mri - luminosity is sensitive to @xmath1 and would have larger impact on the supernova dynamics in the faster spinning pnss .",
    "in this letter , we studied the 3d evolution of the mri by a semi - global model simulating the supernova core .",
    "the nonlinear property of the mri - driven turbulence in the stably stratified layer around the neutrinosphere and its dependence on the initial magnetic flux were quantitatively elucidated .",
    "it was found that the mri - driven turbulence excited in inner and outer mri - unstable regions gradually erodes the strongly - stratified middle mri - stable region .",
    "finally , whole the convectively stable region around the neutrinosphere was overwhelmed with the mhd turbulence .",
    "the intensity of the saturated mri - driven turbulence in the pns was affected by the magnetic flux threading the collapsed core : while the magnetic energy sustained by the mri - driven turbulence was proportional to @xmath83 in the range @xmath82 , it is limited by the free energy stored in the differential rotation when @xmath86 .",
    "our results indicate that the turbulent neutrinosphere is a natural consequence of rotating core - collapse even in the absence of convection .",
    "in addition , the mri - sustained turbulent heating is the most effective when the pulsar - sized magnetic field ( @xmath98@xmath108 g ) threads the post - collapse core in the rapidly rotating pns .",
    "recently , the effects of the turbulence on the supernova dynamics are getting a lot more attention in numerical modeling of ccsne . not only the turbulent heating discussed here , the angular momentum transport and the material mixing in the meridional plane due to the turbulence should also play a crucial role in facilitating ccsne ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
