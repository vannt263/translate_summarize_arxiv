    "random knots and links have been studied through a variety of avenues  initially inspired by physical problems such as the knotting that occurs in bacterial dna .",
    "additionally , link exteriors form an important , classical family of 3-manifolds .",
    "since the set of links is countably infinite , one way to select randomly from this set is to filter links by some kind of complexity , such that the number of links of any given complexity is finite .",
    "from there , we can sample uniformly among links of a given complexity , and see what happens as the complexity increases without bound  the choice of this complexity gives different models of random links , which can have different asymptotic behaviors .",
    "some previously studied models of random knots and links include the petaluma model @xcite , random polygonal walks @xcite , random braids @xcite , and the chebyshev billiard table model @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will examine a model which samples uniformly from ( rooted ) link diagrams of a given number of crossings .",
    "this model is also studied by chapman in @xcite . in the alternating case , using the results of lackenby , thurston , and agol in @xcite , we will show that the expected volume grows linearly in the number of crossings of the link diagram .",
    "[ thm : expectedvolume ] let @xmath0 be the random variable which returns the hyperbolic volume of a random alternating link diagram with @xmath1 crossings .",
    "the expected hyperbolic volume is bounded by @xmath2 }   <   \\left ( \\frac{190v_3}{27 } \\right ) n + \\left ( \\frac{200v_3}{27}-1 \\right ) + o\\left ( \\frac{1}{n}\\right)\\ ] ] numerically , the coefficients on @xmath1 of the lower bound and upper bounds are approximately 0.35711 and 7.14217 , respectively .",
    "so , up to a term that goes to zero , the expected volume is bounded by linear functions of the number of crossings . in big theta notation , @xmath3 }",
    "= \\theta(n)$ ] .",
    "the bounds given in @xcite are given in terms of the twist number of a diagram , not the crossing number .",
    "the main difficulty here is then the computation of the expected twist number in our model , which is in turn deduced from the expected number of bigons in the complement of the diagram .    in the nonalternating case , we show that we generically do not get hyperbolic links .",
    "this occurs in other models as well due to the phenomenon of _ local knotting _ : in `` small '' regions of the diagram , we have positive probability of getting any possible picture , including ones which obstruct hyperbolicity by forcing the link diagram to be a satellite link or unknotted / unlinked ( see figure  [ fig : forbiddentangle ] ) .",
    "this occurs in other models as well  for example , for gaussian random polygons @xcite .",
    "our result gives a formula for the probability of a local picture occurring , and shows it depends only on the `` size '' of the picture . to be more precise ,",
    "a local picture is a rooted tangle diagram with @xmath1 crossings and @xmath4 points intersecting the boundary , which embeds around a given crossing .",
    "we compute the formula for the probability here , and use it to show that one expects a given local picture to occur linearly often ( with respect to the number of crossings ) :    [ thm : genericallynothyperbolic ] let @xmath5 be a rooted tangle with @xmath1 crossings and @xmath4 boundary points .",
    "then , the number of rootings @xmath6 of a random rooted @xmath7-crossing link diagram @xmath8 for which @xmath5 embeds around the root has expectation which is asymptotically linear in @xmath7 , the number of crossings : @xmath9 } = ( 4c ) 2^{-n } p(n , p , c ) + o(cb^{-c})\\ ] ] for some @xmath10 .",

    "the gromov norm of the exterior 5 .",
    "the crossing number    notice that this means generically a random link diagram in our model is highly composite , hence nonhyperbolic .",
    "a similar result is shown in @xcite ; the analogous theorem there states loosely that diagrams which do not contain a given local picture linearly often are exponentially rare among all link diagrams .",
    "he also shows this in the case of random knot diagrams , whereas we only consider link diagrams , which are simpler to work worth .",
    "however , here we can compute explicitly the probability of seeing a given tangle occuring .",
    "we have also included the result of some computer experiments with the _ spherogram _ module in _ snappy _ @xcite implementing this model . in particular",
    ", we find that the hyperbolic volume appears to be quite strongly linear with respect to the crossing number for alternating links . for a given crossing number",
    ", we examine the ( normalized ) distribution of volumes , and present some evidence that it converges to a limiting distribution .",
    "however , this distribution is not normal . finally , to see if the number of bigons and larger faces affects the volume on average , we generated large amounts of data relating these quantities , and find that in some sense , diagrams with larger faces tend to have less volume .",
    "the result in @xcite suggests that as the twist number decreases , or alternatively , the number of bigons increases , the volume should decrease .",
    "what this data suggests that this remains true if we fix the number of bigons and vary the number of triangles , and so on .",
    "the author was partially supported by nsf grant dms-1510204 and campus research board grant rb15127 .",
    "the author is especially indebted to his advisor , nathan dunfield , for suggesting the problem , and for his wonderful help and insight .",
    "in section [ amodelforrandomlinks ] , we describe the model we are using and set up our notation . in section [ alternatinglinkdiagrams ] , we show that the expected hyperbolic volume of a random alternating link in this model is linear in the number of crossings .",
    "we also present the results of numerical experiments about the behavior of the hyperbolic volume . in section [ nonalternatingdiagrams ] , we show that a random nonalternating diagram is typically composite , and compute the probability of seeing a given tangle as a local picture in a random diagram .",
    "finally , in section [ largerfaces ] , we present the preliminary data showing the tendency of diagrams with larger faces to have higher hyperbolic volume , all else being equal .",
    "one natural way to randomly sample links is through link diagrams .",
    "a _ rooted planar map _ is an equivalence class of embeddings of a planar graph into the plane , where the equivalence is given by orientation - preserving homeomorphisms of the sphere , and where one oriented edge called the _ root _ is specified .",
    "the homeomorphism here must take root to root .",
    "loops and multiple edges are allowed .",
    "note that a _ 4-valent _ planar map ( all vertices having valence 4 ) is a projection of a link in @xmath13 into the plane ; to specify a link from a 4-valent planar map , we think of the vertices as crossings and specify which strand goes over which .",
    "we will consider the set of all rooted 4-valent planar maps with @xmath1 vertices , which we denote @xmath14 .",
    "the rooting here makes the problem of enumeration much simpler , as a rooted map can not have any automorphisms preserving the root .",
    "we will also refer sometimes to the _ root vertex _",
    ", the source vertex of the root , and the _ root face _ , the face on the right side of the root , when pointing in the direction of the root .    to randomly sample link diagrams of size @xmath1",
    ", we first sample uniformly at random from @xmath14 , and then flip a coin at each vertex to determine which strand crosses over or under .",
    "we can work with this model computationally due to the work of schaeffer , who describes in @xcite an algorithm to sample uniformly from @xmath14 in linear time , and whose software _ planarmap _ @xcite implementing this algorithm is used by",
    "_ snappy_.    if we wish to restrict to alternating links , then from a given planar map in @xmath14 , there are two choices of alternating link diagrams whose `` shadows '' in the plane are that map .",
    "however , since the diagrams are rooted , we can fix a choice by stipulating that the root edge goes over - to - under . instead of working with @xmath14 , which has diagrams which represent non - prime links",
    ", we will consider instead the sets @xmath15 and @xmath16    by a _ prime _",
    "diagram , we mean that the link diagram is not an `` obvious '' connect sum of two other diagrams , and by _ reduced _ , we mean a diagram that has no loops  no crossings that could immediately be removed with a type i reidemeister move .",
    "these sets are easily seen to be in bijection by our convention for choosing over / under data above ; from now on , we will work exclusively with @xmath17 , and not explicitly mention the bijection . in @xcite , it is shown that the alternating link diagram corresponding to a 3-edge - connected , 4-valent , rooted planar map is the diagram of a prime , alternating , non - split , link .",
    "additionally , such a link is either a torus link or hyperbolic .",
    "various classes of planar maps were enumerated in a series of papers by tutte and brown @xcite .",
    "the class we are interested in was enumerated by brown in @xcite , though in slightly disguised form .",
    "the maps enumerated are _ nonseparable rooted planar maps with n edges _  planar maps without a loop or _ cut - vertex_. a cut - vertex is a vertex @xmath18 which partitions the edges of the map into two sets which only share @xmath18 as a vertex .",
    "this set is in bijection with @xmath17 through the medial bijection ( see figure [ fig : medial ] ) .",
    ".5     .5     note that a cut vertex corresponds exactly to a place where the corresponding link diagram ( under the medial bijection ) can be separated into two halves , connected by two strands .",
    "the convention to transfer the root to the 4-valent map is as in figure [ fig : medial ] .",
    "one should be careful above the inverse of the medial bijection  it appears that , around a vertex of a 4-valent map , there are four choices of oriented edge coming out , hence there should be four associated planar maps after applying the inverse .",
    "there appear to only be two , since we have two orientations of the edge that corresponds to that vertex in the planar map . however , there are two different ( unrooted ) planar maps that give the same ( unrooted ) 4-valent map after the medial bijection , a map and its dual , and each of these will have two rootings of a given edge .",
    "these four possibilities give the four rootings of the corresponding vertex after the medial bijection .",
    "jacquard and schaeffer in @xcite describe an algorithm to sample efficiently from @xmath17 , so we can sample from prime alternating link diagrams of size @xmath1 . in our case , we wish to see that the volume indeed grows linearly in the size of the diagram , as one might expect from the following result from @xcite :    let @xmath19 be a prime , alternating diagram of a hyperbolic link @xmath20 .",
    "then @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the volume of a regular hyperbolic ideal tetrahedron .    moreover , the upper bound is asymptotically sharp .",
    "here @xmath23 represents the _ twist number _ of a diagram , which is defined in @xcite as the number of twist regions .",
    "twist region _ is a maximal chains of bigons , arranged end to end , or a crossing not adjacent to any bigon .",
    "an example is given in figure [ fig : twistnumber ] .",
    "note that for each bigon chain , the number of crossings is one more than the number of bigons .",
    "since the twist regions partition the crossings and the bigons of @xmath19 , @xmath24 \\\\       & = ( \\mbox{\\ # crossings in $ d$ } ) - ( \\mbox{\\ # bigons in $ d$ } )   \\end{split}\\ ] ]    that is , the twist number of a diagram is simply the number of crossings minus the number of bigons in the complement .",
    "there is one corner case here where the formula does nt hold : if the bigon chain connects to itself to make a loop , we then have a connected component of the link diagram which is the standard diagram of the torus link @xmath25 .",
    "since our diagram is assumed connected , there is only one such unrooted diagram to consider , which has two rootings in @xmath17 , as shown in figure [ fig : toruslink ] . in this case , the twist number @xmath23 is just 1 .    .",
    "the root edge will either have a bigon to its right , or a larger face .",
    "those two cases , after homeomorphism of the sphere , can be transformed to the two rootings shown above . ]",
    "so , in order to get bounds on the expected volume in our model , we can simply find the expected number of bigons .",
    "it is brown s enumeration that allows us to do this .",
    "we first find the probability that a randomly chosen element of @xmath17 will have a bigon as its root _",
    "face_.    in the medial bijection between nonseparable planar maps and @xmath17 , a nonseparable planar map where the root vertex has valence @xmath26 corresponds to an element of @xmath17 where the root face has @xmath26 sides .",
    "let @xmath27 be the subset of all elements of @xmath17 where the root face has @xmath26 sides .",

    "that is , we group together all rooted diagrams which are different rootings of the same unrooted diagram .",
    "the useful and generic case here is when the underlying unrooted diagram has no nontrivial automorphisms  orientation preserving homeomorphisms of the sphere taking the diagram to itself which actually permute the edges .",
    "we call such diagrams _ asymmetric_. equivalently , a diagram is _ asymmetric _ if there are exactly @xmath35 inequivalent rootings of the unrooted diagram , one for each oriented edge .",

    "otherwise , we get a contribution of @xmath44 , which will occur for all @xmath26 edges around that face .",

    "take representatives @xmath47 , @xmath48 , of each of the equivalence classes of asymmetric diagrams .",

    "immediately tells you a number of facts about random links .    for a random link diagram ,",
    "the following quantities have expectation which is asymptotically bounded above and below by linear functions of the number of crossings :    1 .",
    "the number of link components 2 .   the number of pieces in the connect sum decomposition 3 .",
    "the number of pieces of the jsj decomposition of the exterior 4 .",
    "the gromov norm of the exterior 5 .",
    "the crossing number    all of these quantities have linear upper bounds in terms of the number of crossings of the link diagram .",
    "this is obvious for the first and last items ; for the jsj decomposition , we can triangulate the exterior of the link with a linearly many tetrahedra , and from there , there are only linearly many disjoint , nonparallel , incompressible surfaces in terms of the number of tetrahedra @xcite .",
    "hence , the number of pieces in the jsj decomposition , which splits along tori , has a linear bound in terms of the number of crossings in the link diagram .",
    "the connect sum decomposition also splits along incompressible tori @xcite , so this argument applies there as well .    in the case of the gromov norm , again , we have a triangulation of the exterior with linearly many tetrahedra as a function of the number of crossings @xmath1 ; for example , the exterior can be divided into @xmath102 tetrahedra @xcite .",
    "so , the gromov norm is also bounded above by a linear function of @xmath1 , as the gromov norm is , by definition , an infimum over a set containing , for instance , the number of tetrahedra in a triangulation .    to get a lower bound on the expectations , we apply theorem  [ thm : genericallynothyperbolic ]",
    " for each quantity , we take a local picture which adds some set amount to the total of that quantity when it occurs . for the number of pieces in the connect sum or jsj decompositions , take the tangles in figure  [ fig : forbiddentangle ] . there are a linear number of each of these in expected value in a random link diagram , so the expected number of components is at least as large .",
    "the linearity of the expected gromov norm follows immediately from this , as we have , in expectation , a linear number of connect summands which are figure 8 knots , for instance .",
    "since , in the jsj decomposition , the gromov norm is ( up to a constant factor ) the sum of the volumes of the hyperbolic pieces @xcite , we have a linear bound on the expectation of the gromov norm .",
    "similarly , for the number of link components , we can use the hopf link example from figure  [ fig : forbiddentangle ] again . note that we even get linearly many split link components , as we could use that diagram but with one crossing changed , so that the loop is not linked anymore .",
    "finally , for the crossing number , if the expectation of the gromov norm is bounded below by a linear function of the number of crossings , then so is the ( minimal ) crossing number  this is an immediate consequence of the fact that the gromov norm is bounded above by a linear function of the crossing number .",
    "in the case of alternating diagrams , links with more bigons tended to have smaller volume , fixing a number of crossings , as it decreases the twist number .",
    "what effect is there from the other possible sizes of faces ? for an alternating diagram @xmath19 with @xmath1 crossings ,",
    "let the _ face type _ of the diagram be the ordered list @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the number of faces in @xmath19 with length @xmath105 .",
    "the cutoff of @xmath106 is an easy upper bound for the maximum length of a face in a diagram using an euler characteristic argument .",
    "looking first at the hoste - thistlethwaite census of link exteriors with 14 crossings , we can sort lexicographically by the face type and plot against the volume ( see figure [ fig : vol_vs_facetype_alt_and_nonalt_14_crossings ] ) .",
    "each peak corresponds to incrementing the number of bigons .",
    "the general downward trend is because increasing the number of bigons decreases the twist number , so the volume tends to decrease .",
    "if we look at randomly generated alternating links with 50 crossings we still see a similar pattern ( see figure [ fig : vol_vs_facetype_alt_50 ] ) .        note that for a given peak , the volume tends to sharply decrease in the number of 3 sided faces that we see , so there appears to be some dependence on larger faces . zooming in on one of these peaks ( fixing the number of bigons )",
    "gives figure [ fig : vol_vs_facetype_alt_50_zoomed ] .",
    "even if we fix the number of crossings , bigons , and faces of size 3 , we see that the hyperbolic volume will have a tendency to decrease when you increase the number of faces of size 4 ( see figure [ fig : volume_vs_quads ] ) . the effect now though is fairly weak ."
