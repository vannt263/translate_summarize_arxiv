    "transport studies provide a powerful tool for investigating electronic properties of a conductor .",
    "the @xmath0 characteristic ( or the differential resistance @xmath1 ) contains partial information on the mechanisms responsible for conduction . a much more complete description of transport in the steady state , and further information on the conduction mechanisms , is given by the probability distribution of the current @xmath2 , which describes both the dc current @xmath0 and the fluctuations .",
    "indeed , even with a fixed voltage @xmath3 applied , @xmath4 fluctuates , due to the discreteness of the charge carriers , the probabilistic character of scattering and the fluctuations of the population of energy levels at finite temperature @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the current fluctuations are characterized by the moments of the probability distribution @xmath2 of order two and higher .",

    "gaussian noise @xmath11 is symmetric , so it has no third moment .",
    "the existence of the third moment is related to the breaking of time reversal symmetry by the dc current ; at zero bias , @xmath12 and positive and negative current fluctuations are equivalent , so @xmath13 .",
    "an intense theoretical effort has emerged recently to calculate the third and higher moments of @xmath2 in various systems @xcite . however , until now only the second moment has been measured in the many systems studied .",
    "interest in the third and higher moments has occurred , first , because its character is predicted to differ significantly from that of the second moment ; in particular , the third moment is insensitive to the sample s own johnson noise for the voltage bias case , yet is more sensitive , in a very subtle manner , to noise and loading by the environment .",
    "second , measurements of the higher moments may provide a new tool for studying conduction physics , complementary to the second moment .",
    "it is the first set of issues that we address .    in this article",
    "we summarize the first measurements of the third moment of the voltage fluctuations across a conductor , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 represents the voltage fluctuations around the dc voltage @xmath3 ( some of the data presented here have been published in ref .  ) .",
    "below we relate this to @xmath10 .",
    "our experimental setup is such that the sample is current biased at dc and low frequency but the electromagnetic environment has an impedance @xmath16 within the detection bandwidth , 10 mhz to 1.2 ghz .",
    "we have investigated tunnel junctions because they are predicted to be the simplest system having asymmetric current fluctuations .",
    "however , any kind of good conductor can be studied with the techniques we have developed .",
    "we studied two different samples , at liquid helium , liquid nitrogen and room temperatures .",
    "our results are in agreement with a recent theory that considers the strong effect of the electromagnetic environment of the sample @xcite .",
    "moreover , we show that certain of these environmental effects can be dramatically reduced by signal propagation delays from the sample to the amplifier .",
    "this can guide future experiments on more exotic samples .",
    "we present first the case of voltage bias . the scattering theory applied to transport ( the so - called landauer picture )",
    "has been very succesful in predicting many properties of phase - coherent systems coupled to reservoirs .",
    "we thus employ that framework .",
    "the two contacts to the sample are reservoirs at temperature @xmath5 .",
    "the sample is described by a set of @xmath17 transmission channels characterized by their transmission probability @xmath18 , which we take to be energy independent . except for the quantum point contact @xcite",
    ", only statistical properties of @xmath19 can be accessed .",
    "the case of a diffusive wire is special in that it is well described by random matrix theory , and the full probability distribution of the transmission coefficients is known @xcite .",
    "the tunnel junction of area @xmath20 with a uniform barrier of tranparency @xmath21 can be modeled by @xmath22 channels , each of which has @xmath23 . until now only the first two moments @xmath24 of the probability distribution of @xmath19 have been accessed in measurements : the conductance @xmath25 , which involves the average @xmath26 of the @xmath19 , and the noise power density @xmath27 ( in a@xmath28hz ) : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the fano factor , which involves the variance of @xmath19 .",
    "for an opaque tunnel junction , all @xmath31 and @xmath32 ; for a diffusive wire @xmath33 . at equilibrium , @xmath34 and eq.([eq_s2 ] ) reduces to the johnson noise @xmath35 , whereas for @xmath36 ( the so called shot noise regime ) , eq.([eq_s2 ] ) leads to @xmath37 . and",
    "@xmath38 in the literature ; the factor 2 corresponds to the contributions of positive and negative frequencies . ]    for @xmath39 , we extend the case of a voltage biased single channel @xcite to obtain for a multichannel conductor : @xmath40 ( in a@xmath28hz@xmath41 ) with @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "we find that the function @xmath44 is simply related to @xmath27 by @xmath45 .",
    "the tunnel junction with uniform barrier of transparency @xmath21 corresponds to @xmath46 , the diffusive wire to @xmath47 @xcite .",

    "it can be negative when @xmath57 , as for the single quantum channel at large voltage when @xmath58 .",
    "thus , if more than half the electrons incident from the left reservoir are transmitted , @xmath39 is negative .",
    "still , @xmath39 is always positive for @xmath49 , and is positive at all voltages if all @xmath31 ( in which case @xmath59 and @xmath60 ) .",
    "it is noticeable that the _ shape _ of the @xmath61 curve does not depend solely on @xmath53 , so a careful calibration is necessary to obtain @xmath53 .",
    "in contrast , @xmath62 can be experimentally extracted from the ratio @xmath63 of the slopes at high voltage and low voltage ; @xmath64 . thus @xmath62 can be determined even in the absence of calibration of the experiment .",
    "the measurement of the third moment of current fluctuations provides information on the distribution of the transparencies of the channels of the sample .",
    "in particular , since it involves the third power of the @xmath18 , it is much more sensitive to open channels than the conductance or even than @xmath27 .",
    "for example , in tunnel junctions , the distribution may have a tail that extends close to @xmath65 ( pinholes ) @xcite .",
    "let us consider a tunnel junction of @xmath66 channels of transparency @xmath67 ( i.e. , with a resistance about 26@xmath68 ) .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath69 .",
    "if one adds to the junction 100 channels of transparency @xmath70 , the distribution of the channels is modified .",
    "the average transmission @xmath26 , and thus the conductance , is increased by only 1% .",
    "the second moment is multiplied by 10 , but this modifies @xmath53 by only @xmath71 .",
    "in contrast , @xmath72 is multiplied by @xmath73 , so @xmath74 , i.e. , is multiplied by 100 ! for a tunnel junction , the temperature dependent part ( the first term of eq .",
    "( [ eq_s3bis ] ) is proportionnal to @xmath62 and thus enhanced by a factor 100 , but the second term , proportionnal to @xmath75 is not much influenced by the additionnal open channels .    as we show below",
    ", our samples correspond to good junction tunnel for which @xmath76 . using the general property @xmath77",
    ", we deduce from our measurement of @xmath78 , that @xmath79 .",
    "thus , one can consider that our samples are tunnel junctions with an opaque barrier .",
    "for such a sample , the current noise spectral density ( related below to the second moment ) is given by : @xmath80 . only at high voltage @xmath36",
    "does this reduce to the poisson result @xmath81 .",
    "the third moment of the fluctuations is given by @xmath51 .",
    "the quantities @xmath82 are spectral densities , expressed in a@xmath83/hz@xmath84 .",
    "until now we have supposed that @xmath82 is frequency independent , but in general it may depend on frequency .",
    "then the @xmath85th moment depends on @xmath86 frequencies @xmath87 .",
    "however , it is convenient to express @xmath82 as a function of @xmath85 frequencies such that the sum of all the frequencies is zero . introducing the fourier components @xmath88 of the current",
    ", one has , for a classical current : @xmath89 in quantum mechanics , the current operators taken at different times do not commute ; they also do not in fourier space , and the question of how the operators have to be ordered is crucial @xcite .    in the case of the second moment , one has @xmath90 .",
    "it measures the power emitted by the sample at the frequency @xmath91 within a bandwidth of 1hz .",
    "this is what a spectrum analyzer measures .",
    "experimentally , the current emitted by the sample runs through a series of cables , filters and amplifiers before beeing detected ( this can be avoided by an on - chip detection @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the measured quantity is a filtered current @xmath92 where @xmath93 describes the filter function of the detection .",
    "one is often interested in the total power emitted by the sample .",
    "this is obtained by measuring the dc voltage after squaring @xmath94 , i.e. @xmath95 .",
    "this quantity is related to @xmath27 through : @xmath96 it is remarkable that the frequency - dependent phase shift introduced by @xmath93 has no influence , in agreement with the fact that @xmath27 has the meaning of a power .",
    "if the detection bandwidth extend from @xmath97 to @xmath98 , i.e. , @xmath99 for @xmath100 and @xmath101 otherwise , and if @xmath27 is frequency independent between @xmath97 and @xmath98 , then the total noise is given by @xmath102 .",
    "this corresponds to the number of choices of @xmath91 between @xmath97 and @xmath98 , i.e. , @xmath103 , multiplied by the number of choices for the sign of @xmath91 , i.e. , 2 .",
    "let us consider now @xmath39 .",
    "as we said before , the spectral density of the third moment of current fluctuations depend on two frequencies @xmath104 and @xmath105 , and the third moment of the measured current @xmath94 is given by : @xmath106 we see that now the phase of @xmath93 matters . more precisely , @xmath39 measures how three fourier components of the current can beat together to give a non - zero result , i.e. , it measures the phase correlations between these three fourier components . with the same hypothesis as before , for a detection between @xmath97 and @xmath98 , one has now @xmath107 if @xmath108 and @xmath13 otherwise .",
    "this shows how important it is to make a broadband measurement .",
    "this unusual dependence of the result on @xmath97 and @xmath98 comes from the fact that the lowest frequency being the sum of two others is @xmath109 whereas the maximum frequency one can subtract to that in order to have a dc signal is @xmath98 .",
    "the number of choices for @xmath104 and @xmath105 is @xmath110 and the number of possible signs for the frequencies is 6 ( all combinations except @xmath111 and @xmath112 ) .",
    "as we show below , we have experimentally confirmed this unusual dependence of @xmath10 on @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "we now consider the effects of the sample s electromagnetic environment ( contacts , leads , amplifier , etc . ) ; the sample is no longer voltage biased .",
    "the environment emits noise , inducing fluctuations of the voltage across the sample , which in turn modify the probability distribution @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , due to the finite impedance of the environment , the noise emitted by the sample itself induces also voltage fluctuations .",
    "this self - mixing of the noise by the sample is responsible for the coulomb blockade of high resistance samples , where it induces a modification of the @xmath0 characteristics @xcite .",
    "we consider the circuit depicted in fig .",
    "[ schematics ] , at first neglecting time delay along the coaxial cable .",
    "the noise of the sample of resistance @xmath113 is modeled by a current generator @xmath114 .",
    "the voltage @xmath115 is measured across a resistor @xmath116 , which has a current generator @xmath117 of noise spectral density @xmath118 .",
    "one has @xmath119 with @xmath120 ( @xmath113 in parallel with @xmath116 ) .",
    "the spectral density of the second moment of the voltage fluctuations is @xmath121 .",
    "thus , the only effect of the environment on the second moment of the noise is to rescale the fluctuations ( by @xmath122 ) and add a bias - independent contribution @xcite .",
    "in contrast , it has been recently predicted that the third moment of @xmath2 is significantly modified by the environment @xcite : @xmath123    we now give a simple derivation of this result .",
    "one has @xmath124 .",
    "the term @xmath125 is zero .",
    "the term @xmath126 is zero for a environment at equilibrium , but can be non - zero if the noise that the sample sees comes from an active device like an amplifier .",
    "our detection method is insensitive to this term and we will neglect it . the first term on the right of eq .",
    "( [ eqenv ] ) is like that of the second moment ( it comes from @xmath127 ) . the negative sign results from an increasing sample current giving a reduced voltage .",
    "in order to understand the other terms , let us first consider the correlator @xmath128 .",
    "this correlator measures the effect of the external current @xmath117 on the amount of noise @xmath129 emitted by the sample .",
    "if @xmath117 varies slowly on the time scale of the current fluctuations ( i.e. , @xmath130 ) , one can replace @xmath129 by its time average , @xmath27 taken at the instantaneous , slowly varying ( with a time scale of the order of the rc time of the junction ) , voltage @xmath131 . since @xmath115 depends on @xmath117 , the correlator @xmath128 does not vanish",
    ". we can calculate it for @xmath132 , for which one can taylor expand @xmath27 in @xmath133 .",
    "we deduce @xmath134 .",
    "this leads to the second term on the right of eq.([eqenv ] ) .",
    "it represents the effect of the noise emitted by the environment , and disappeares if the environment is at zero temperature .",
    "similarly , the correlator @xmath127 can be seen as the effect of the sample s current @xmath114 acting on the noise @xmath129 emitted by itself , and leads to the third term on the right of eq .",
    "( [ eqenv ] ) ( the time scale are no longer separated , but a rigorous calculation @xcite shows that eq.([eqenv ] ) is nevertheless valid ) .",
    "this happens because of the finite impedance of the environment and persists at zero temperature .",
    "it represents the feedback of the environment .",
    "we give below a simple derivation of how to include the effect of propagation time in the coaxial cable , which dramatically affects @xmath135 .",
    "let us remark that there are terms of order @xmath136 and higher , that are small and neglected here .",
    "such terms affect slightly @xmath137 as well .",
    "they correspond to photon assisted noise in the low frequency limit @xmath138 @xcite .",
    "let us evaluate the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) for the measurement of @xmath139 as compared to the measurements of @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "we will suppose that the noise is dominated by the amplifier s noise current @xmath142 , characterized by a spectral density @xmath143 .",
    "we note @xmath144 the bandwidth of the measurement and @xmath145 the averaging time . we suppose the low frequency cutoff to be much smaller than the upper one , such that @xmath146 .",
    "the number of statistically independent measurements is @xmath147 , and the snr always increases like @xmath148 . for the dc",
    "current the snr is : @xmath149 where var denotes the statistical variance , var@xmath150 .",
    "we suppose the amplifier s noise to be gaussian , so var@xmath151 .",
    "@xmath152 , @xmath153 , @xmath154 , etc . could be avoided by the use of @xmath85 amplifiers and correlation methods . ] as expected , the result for @xmath155 is independant of @xmath144 , since @xmath156 is a dc quantity .",
    "similarly , one has for the second moment : @xmath157 with @xmath158 .",
    "@xmath159 is the ratio of the shot noise of a current eb ( one electron every @xmath160 seconds ) to the noise of the amplifier .",
    "finally , the snr @xmath161 of the third moment is : @xmath162    for a sample with high impedance , one should use detection in the audio frequency . taking @xmath163s , @xmath164khz , @xmath165a@xmath166/hz ,",
    "gives @xmath167 .",
    "this estimate shows how difficult is the measurement of @xmath39 as compared to a conductance , or even a @xmath27 measurement . for a sample with an impedance comparable with @xmath168",
    ", one can use rf technique and have a huge bandwidth .",
    "we chose this option .",
    "our setup corresponds to @xmath169ghz and a noise temperature of @xmath170k ( @xmath171 ) , and thus @xmath172 .",
    "this seems much worse than the previous case ; however , one can pass much more current through a low resistance sample , which makes the two techniques comparable .",
    "the use of a cryogenic amplifier , with 10 times smaller noise temperature would increase the snr by @xmath173 .",
    "however , one can be limited by the amount of current through the sample , in particular if the relevant voltage scale is set by the temperature .",
    "two samples have been studied . both are tunnel junctions made of al / al oxide / al , using the double angle evaporation technique @xcite . in sample a the bottom and top al films are 50 nm thick . the bottom electrode was oxidized for 2 hours in pure @xmath174 at a pressure of 500 mtorr .",
    "the junction area is @xmath175m@xmath166 . in sample b ,",
    "the films are 120 nm and 300 nm thick , oxidation was for 10 min , and the junction area is @xmath176 @xcite .",
    "we have measured @xmath177 in real time ( see fig . [ setup ] ) .",
    "the third moment of the voltage fluctuations @xmath135 is a very small quantity , and its measurement requires much more care than @xmath137 . for example , any non linearity of the amplifiers gives rise to a fake signal , and we have checked that our result was independent of the amplitude of the signal at the input of the various amplifiers .",
    "moreover , since the signal is very small , much more averaging is needed than for @xmath137 .",
    "the sample is dc current biased through a bias tee .",
    "the noise emitted by the sample is coupled out to an rf amplifier through a capacitor so only the ac part of the current is amplified .",
    "the resistance of the sample is close to @xmath178 , and thus is well matched to the coaxial cable and amplifier .",
    "after amplification at room temperature the signal is separated into four equal branches , each of which carries a signal proportionnal to @xmath179 .",
    "a mixer multiplies two of the branches , giving @xmath180 ; a second mixer multiplies this result with another branch .",
    "the length of the cables between the splitter and the mixers has been adjusted to insure that the products correspond to the voltage taken at the same time .",
    "this has been done with the use of short ( 1ns long ) pulses .",
    "the output of the second mixer , @xmath181 , is then low pass filtered , to give a signal which we refer to as d. ideally d is simply proportional to @xmath135 , where the constant of proportionality depends on mixer gains and frequency bandwidth .",
    "the last branch is connected to a square - law crystal detector , which produces a voltage @xmath182 proportional to the the rf power it receives : the noise of the sample @xmath183 plus the noise of the amplifiers .",
    "the dc current @xmath156 through the sample is swept slowly .",
    "we record @xmath184 and @xmath185 ; these are averaged numerically .",
    "this detection scheme has the advantage of the large bandwidth it provides ( @xmath186 ghz ) , which is crucial for the measurement . due to the imperfections of the mixers",
    ", @xmath187 contains some contribution of @xmath137 , and some contribution of the amplifiers , which are independent of @xmath156 : @xmath188 .",
    "when the current is reversed , one observes that @xmath182 is the same , @xmath189 , while @xmath187 is not , see fig .",
    "this prooves the asymmetry of the current fluctuations .",
    "we deduce @xmath190 , since @xmath137 does not depend on the sign of @xmath156 . and @xmath191 .",
    "]      in order to calibrate the measurement of @xmath183 , we measure the johnson noise emitted by a macroscopic @xmath168 resistor at various temperatures .",
    "this gives the gain of the detecion scheme as well as its noise temperature ( dominated by the first amplifier ) .",
    "since the third moment of the current fluctuations had never been measured before , we can not rely on any sample .",
    "thus , in order to determine the magnitude and sign of @xmath14 we measured the signal d when the sample is replaced by a programmable function generator . the output of the generator consist of a pseudo - random sequence of voltage steps ( at a rate of @xmath192 samples per second , 1gs / s ) , the statistics of which we calculated to be asymmetric in a known way . by varying the maximum amplitude @xmath193 of the signal and reversing its sign",
    ", we can measure the coefficients @xmath194 and @xmath191 , which vary as @xmath195 and @xmath196 respectively .",
    "however , the actual signal synthesized by the generator is not exactly the one which one specifies . due to the finite output bandwidth of the generator ,",
    "the steps are rounded , which modifies the statistics of the output signal .",
    "we measured this statistics with a 20gs / s oscilloscope , and used the result to calibrate our measurement .",
    "now that we have checked what @xmath135 is for our sample , we can use the result to calibrate future experiments .",

    "we measured that the modulus @xmath218 varies between @xmath219 and @xmath220 within the detection bandwidth , in reasonable agreement with @xmath216 extracted from the fits .",
    "@xmath116 represents an average over frequency of the impedance seen by the sample@xcite .",
    "we notice that the theory predicts a structure at low voltage for high enough temperature ( see fig .",
    "[ sampleb ] , dashed line , middle and bottom ) , that we observe only at room temperature .",
    "we think this comes from the fact that at 77k we used a long cable , and thus had a largely frequency dependent impedance @xmath217 , whereas at room temperature we used a much shorter cable .",
    "the presence of the low voltage structure is indeed very much dependent on the value chosen for @xmath116 , and might be washed out by frequency averaging with a long cable .",
    "we have measured directly the noise emitted by the room temperature amplifier ; we find @xmath221 k. this is in disagreement with the parameters @xmath215 deduced from the fit of the data .",
    "however , we show below that this is explained by the finite propagation time along the coaxial cable between the sample and the amplifier .      to analyze our results , let us consider again the circuit in fig .",
    "[ schematics ] , a simplified equivalent of our setup .",
    "@xmath222 is the input impedance of the amplifier , which is connected to the sample through a coaxial cable of impedance @xmath116 ( i.e. , matched to the amplifier ) .",
    "the sample s voltage reflection coefficient is @xmath223 . in the analysis we present",
    "next we neglect the influence of the contact resistance and impedance mismatch of the amplifier , but we have included it when computing the theory to compare to the data .",
    "the voltage @xmath179 measured by the amplifier at time @xmath21 arises from three contributions : i ) the noise emitted by the amplifier at time @xmath21 : @xmath224 ; half of @xmath117 enters the cable .",
    "ii ) the noise emitted by the sample ( at time @xmath225 , where @xmath226 is the propagation delay along the cable ) that couples into the cable : @xmath227 ; iii ) the noise emitted by the amplifier at time @xmath228 that is reflected by the sample : @xmath229 ; thus , @xmath230-\\frac r2(1-\\gamma)i(t-\\delta t ) \\label{eqgamma}\\ ] ] for @xmath231 , eq . ( [ eqgamma ] ) reduces to @xmath119 with @xmath120 . thus , eq.([eqgamma ] ) for @xmath231 corresponds to eq .",
    "( [ eqenv ] ) , which is a particular case of eq .",
    "( 12b ) of ref .  .",
    "thus , @xmath124 for @xmath231 .",
    "as we already show , the term @xmath128 leads to the second term on the right of eq .",
    "( [ eqenv ] ) . and the term @xmath127 to the first term of eq .",
    "( [ eqenv ] ) , and , due to the sample noise modulating its own voltage , the third term of eq .",
    "( [ eqenv ] ) as well .",
    "the finite propagation time does affect the correlator @xmath128 , which has to be replaced by @xmath232 .",
    "thus the term @xmath118 in eq .",
    "( [ eqenv ] ) has to be replaced by @xmath233 , where @xmath234 is the spectral density corresponding to the correlator @xmath235 .",
    "for long enough @xmath226 this term vanishes , since @xmath117 emitted at times @xmath21 and @xmath228 are uncorrelated .",
    "thus , the effect of the propagation time is to renormalize the noise temperature of the environment @xmath236 into @xmath237 .",
    "we now check whether the finite propagation time can explain our values of @xmath215 .",
    "the cable of length @xmath238 m corresponds to @xmath226 being long for the bandwidth we used . as a consequence , the relevant noise temperature to be used to explain the data is @xmath215 . for sample a , @xmath239 ; including the contact resistance and cable attenuation one expects @xmath240 k ; for sample b , @xmath241 and one expects @xmath242 k. a much shorter cable was used for @xmath214 k , and the reduction of @xmath243 is not complete .",
    "these numbers are in reasonably good agreement with the values of @xmath215 deduced from the fits ( see fig .",
    "[ samplea ] and [ sampleb ] ) , and certainly agree with the trend seen for the two samples .",
    "clearly @xmath244 for the long cable .",
    "if there are some open channels in the tunnel junction , @xmath39 is modified according to eq .",
    "( [ eq_s3bis ] ) .",
    "since we know that @xmath62 is small , the effect on the temperature independent part of @xmath135 is small .",
    "however , the term proportionnal to @xmath62 might influence @xmath135 .",
    "it appears that this term is indistinguishable from the effect of the noise of the environnement ( the correlator @xmath128 ) .",
    "it adds a ( negative ) contribution to @xmath243 , given by @xmath245 . taking @xmath246 ( the maximum value compatible with our measurement of @xmath53 )",
    ", one has @xmath247 .",
    "this effect is intrinsic to the sample and is not modified by the propagation delay . as a result , it would give an even better agreement between the evaluation of @xmath215 and the values deduced from the fit .",
    "a precise measurement of @xmath62 would require a quieter environment ( i.e. , the use of a cryogenic amplifier ) and/or a better impedance match between the sample and the amplifier .",
    "in order to demonstrate more explicitly the influence of the environment on @xmath135 we have modified the parameters @xmath243 and @xmath116 of the environment and measured the effect on @xmath135 .",
    "@xmath243 is a measure of the current fluctuations emitted by the environment towards the sample .",
    "its influence on @xmath135 is through the correlator @xmath128 .",
    "this correlator does not require @xmath117 to be a randomly fluctuating quantity in order not to vanish .",
    "so we can modify it by adding a signal @xmath248 to @xmath117 ( with @xmath68 within the detection bandwidth ) . that way we have been able to modify @xmath215 without changing @xmath116 , as shown on fig .",
    "[ env ] . the term @xmath234 oscillates like @xmath249 , and thus one can enhance ( curve a1 as compared to a0 in fig . [ env ] ) or decrease @xmath215 , and even make it negative ( fig .",
    "[ env ] , a2 ) .",
    "the curves a0a2 are all parallel at high voltage , as expected , since the impedance of the environment remains unchanged ; @xmath216 is the same for the fit of the three curves .",
    "the experiment described here , i.e. measuring the current fluctuations in the presence of a dc plus an ac voltage , is called photon assisted noise when @xmath137 is measured@xcite . in this context , a frequency of the order of @xmath250 has to be used , and the mechanism can be understood in terms of photons . in our case , since the third moment of the current fluctuations involves an odd number of current operators , the particle - like aspect of the ac excitation is less clear and deserves more study .",
    "second , by adding a @xmath251 resistor in parallel with the sample ( without the ac excitation ) we have been able to change the resistance of the environment @xmath116 , and thus the high voltage slope of @xmath135 .",
    "the fit of curve a3 gives @xmath252 , in excellent agreement with the expected value of @xmath253 ( @xmath251 in parallel with @xmath254 ) .",
    "since this makes the reflection coefficient negative ( @xmath255 ) , the presence of the extra resistor also reverses the sign of @xmath215 , as expected .",
    "this is not due to a negative temperature , but rather to a negative @xmath256 .",
    "our data are fully consistent with a third moment of current fluctuations @xmath39 being independent of @xmath5 between 4k and 300k when the sample is voltage biased , as predicted for a tunnel junction .",
    "the effect of the environment , through its noise and impedance , is clearly demonstrated .",
    "this is of prime importance for designing future measurements on samples with unknown third moment .",
