    "atmospheric phenomena are accompanied by variations at spatial and temporal scales . in the present study ,",
    "qualitative aspects of temporal wind speed data recorded at an altitude of 10 ft from the earth s surface are discussed .",
    "such recordings fall under the abl , which is the region 1 - 2 km from the earths surface @xcite .",
    "flows in the abl , which are generally known to be turbulent , are influenced by a number of factors including shearing stresses , convective instabilities , surface friction and topography @xcite .",
    "the study of laboratory scale turbulent velocity fields has received a lot of attention in the past ( see @xcite for a summary ) .",
    "a. n. kolmogorov @xcite , ( k41 ) proposed a similarity theory where energy in the inertial sub - range is cascaded from the larger to smaller eddies under the assumption of local isotropy .",
    "for the same , k41 statistics is also termed as small - scale turbulence statistics . the seminal work of kolmogorov encouraged researchers to investigate scaling properties of turbulent velocity fields using the concepts of fractals @xcite .",
    "subsequent works of parisi and frisch @xcite , meneveau and srinivasan , @xcite provided a multifractal description of turbulent velocity fields .",
    "while there has been a precedence of scaling behavior in turbulence at microscopic scales @xcite it is not necessary that such a scaling manifest itself at macroscopic scales , although there have been indications of  unified scaling \" models of atmospheric dynamics , @xcite .",
    "several factors can significantly affect the behavior of a complex system such as abl @xcite .",
    "thus , an extension of these earlier findings @xcite to the present study is neither immediate , nor obvious .",
    "attempts have also been made to simulate the behavior of the abl @xcite .",
    "however , there are implicit assumptions made in these studies and often , there can be significant discrepancies between simulated flows and the actual phenomenon when these assumptions are violated @xcite . on the other hand , knowledge about the nature of wind speed at abl has far reaching impact on several fields of research .",
    "in particular , the need to obtain accurate statistical descriptions of flows in the abl from actual site recordings is both urgent and important , given its utility in the planning , design and efficient operation of wind turbines , @xcite .",
    "therefore , analysis of wind speed records based on numerical techniques is gaining importance in the recent years . in @xcite , long term daily records of wind speed and direction",
    "were represented as a two dimensional random walk and the results reinforce the important role that memory effects have on the dynamics of complex systems . in @xcite , the short term memory of recorded surface wind speed records",
    "is utilized to build @xmath1th order markov chain models , from which probabilistic forecasts of short time wind gusts are made . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors study the correlations in wind speed data sets over a span of 24 hours , using detrended fluctuation analysis ( dfa ) , @xcite and its extension , multifractal - dfa ( mf - dfa)@xcite .",
    "their studies show that the records display long range correlations with a fluctuation exponent of @xmath2 along with a broad multifractal spectrum .",
    "in addition , they also suggest the need for detailed analysis of data sets from several other stations to ascertain whether such features are characteristic of wind speed records . in @xcite",
    ", it is shown that rare events such as wind gusts in wind speed data sets that are long range correlated are themselves long range correlated . in @xcite , it is shown that surface layer wind speed records can be characterized by multiplicative cascade models with different scaling relations in the microscale inertial range and the mesoscale .",
    "our previous studies , @xcite suggest that at short time scales , hourly average wind speed records are characterized by a scaling exponent @xmath3 and at large time scales , by an exponent of @xmath4 . a deeper examination of the data sets in @xcite using mf - dfa indicated that the records also admitted a broad multifractal spectrum under the assumption of a binomial multiplicative cascade model .",
    "interestingly , scaling phenomena have also been found in fluctuations of meteorological variables that influence wind speed such as air humidity , @xcite , temperature records and precipitation @xcite . in @xcite , it is observed that while temperature records display long range correlations ( @xmath5 ) , they do not display a broad multifractal spectrum . on the other hand , precipitation records display a very weak degree of correlation with ( @xmath6 , @xcite ) . while it is difficult to directly relate the scaling results of these variables to that of wind speed , greater insight",
    "can be gained by analyzing data sets that are recorded over long spans from different meteorological stations .",
    "motivated by these findings , we chose to investigate the temporal aspects of wind speed records dispersed over a wide geographical area . in the present study ,",
    "we follow a systematic approach in determining the nature of the scaling of wind speed records recorded at an altitude of 10 ft across 28 spatially separated locations spanning an area of approximately 70,000 sq.mi and recorded over a period of nearly 8 years in the state of north dakota .",
    "as noted earlier , convective instabilities and topography can have a prominent impact of the flow in abl .",
    "the air motion over north dakota is governed by the flow of three distinct air masses with distinct qualities , namely from : ( i ) the polar regions to the north ( cold and dry ) ( ii ) the gulf of mexico to the south ( warm and moist ) and ( iii ) the northern pacific region ( mild and dry ) . the rapid progression and interaction of these air masses results in the region being subject to considerable climactic variability .",
    "these in turn can have a significant impact on the convective instabilities which governs the flow in abl . on the other hand ,",
    "the topography of the region has sharp contrasts on the eastern and western parts of the state because of their approximate separation by the boundary of continental glaciation .",
    "the eastern regions have a soft topography compared to the western region which comprises mostly of rugged bedrock . in the present study",
    ", we show that the qualitative characteristics of the wind speed records do not change across the spatially separated locations despite the contrasting topography .",
    "this leads us to hypothesize that the confluence of the air masses as opposed to the topography plays a primary role in governing the wind dynamics over nd .",
    "spectral analysis of stationary processes is related to correlations in it by the wiener - khinchin theorem , @xcite and has been used for detecting possible long - range correlations . in the present study , we observed broad - band power - law decay superimposed with peaks .",
    "this spectral signature was consistent across all the 28 stations ( fig .",
    "[ plate1](b ) ) .",
    "such power - law processes lack well - defined scales and have been attributed to self - organized criticality , intermittency , self - similarity @xcite and multiscale randomness @xcite . superimposed on the power - law spectrum , were two high frequency peaks which occur at @xmath7 and @xmath8 hours corresponding to diurnal and semi - diurnal cycles respectively .",
    "+    power - law decay of the power - spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ plate1](b ) ) can provide cues to possible long - range correlations , but , however , it is susceptible to trends and non - stationarities which are ubiquitous in recordings of natural phenomena .",
    "while several estimators @xcite have been proposed in the past for determining the scaling exponents from the given data , detrended fluctuation analysis ( dfa ) , @xcite and its extension , generalized multifractal - dfa ( mf - dfa)@xcite have been widely used to determine the nature of the scaling in data obtained from diverse settings @xcite . in dfa ,",
    "the scaling exponent for the given monofractal data is determined from least - squares fit to the log - log plot of the second - order fluctuation functions versus the time - scale , i.e. @xmath9vs@xmath10 where @xmath11 . for mf - dfa , the variation of the fluctuation function with time scale is determined for varying @xmath12 ) .",
    "the superiority of dfa and mf - dfa to other estimators along with a complete description is discussed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "dfa and mf - dfa procedures follow a differencing approach that can be useful in eliminating local trends @xcite .",
    "however , recent studies have indicated the susceptibility of dfa and mf - dfa to higher order polynomial trends . subsequently , dfa-@xmath13 @xcite was proposed to eliminate polynomial trends up to order @xmath14 . in the present ,",
    "study we have used polynomial detrending of order four .",
    "however , such an approach might not be sufficient to remove sinusoidal trends which can be periodic @xcite or quasiperiodic ( see discussion in appendix a ) .",
    "+ data sets spanning a number of years , as discussed here , are susceptible to seasonal trends that can be periodic or quasiperiodic in nature .",
    "such trends manifest themselves as peaks in the power spectrum and their power is a fraction of the broad - band noise .",
    "these trends can also introduce spurious crossovers as reflected by log - log plot of @xmath9vs@xmath10 and prevent reliable estimation of the scaling exponent .",
    "such crossovers indicate spurious existence of multiple scaling exponents at different scales and shift towards higher time scales with increasing order of polynomial detrending @xcite .",
    "thus , it is important to discern correlations that are an outcome of trends from those of the power - law noise . in a recent study ,",
    "@xcite , a singular - value decomposition ( svd ) based approach was proposed to minimize the effect of the various types of trends superimposed on long - range correlated noise",
    ". however , svd is a linear transform and may be susceptible when linearity assumptions are violated .",
    "therefore , we provide a qualitative argument to identify multifractality in wind speed records superimposed with periodic and/or quasiperiodic trends . multifractality is reflected by a change in the slope of the log - log fluctuation plots with varying @xmath15 with @xmath16 @xcite . for a fixed @xmath15 ,",
    "one observes spurious crossovers in monofractals well as multifractal data sets superimposed sinusoidal trends .",
    "thus nonlinearity or a crossover of the log - log plot for a fixed @xmath15 might be due to trends as opposed to the existence of multiple scaling exponents at different scales . however , we show ( see discussion under appendix a ) that the nature of log - log plot of @xmath9vs@xmath10 does not change with varying @xmath15 for monofractal data superimposed with sinusoidal trends .",
    "however , a marked change in the nature if the log - log plots @xmath9vs@xmath10 with varying @xmath15 is observed for multifractal data superimposed with trends .",
    "therefore , in the present study , the log - log plot of @xmath17 vs @xmath18 with varying @xmath15 is used as a qualitative description of multifractal structure in the given data . for the wind - speed records across the 28 stations",
    ", we found the peaks in the power spectrum to be consistent across all the 28 stations .",
    "thus any effects due to the trend on the multifractal structure , we believe would be consistent across the 28 stations .",
    "mf - dfa was applied to the data sets recorded at the 28 stations .",
    "the log - log plots of the fluctuation functions ( @xmath19 vs @xmath10 ) with varying moments @xmath15 = -10 , -6 , -0.2 , 2 , 6 , 10 ) using fourth order polynomial detrending for one of the representative records is shown in fig.[plate1](c ) . from fig.[plate1](c ) , it can be observed that the data sets exhibit different scaling behavior with varying @xmath15 , characteristic of a multifractal process .",
    "this has to be contrasted with monofractal data whose scaling behavior is indifferent to the choice of @xmath15 in the presence or absence of sinusoidal trends . + to compute the @xmath15 dependence of the scaling exponent @xmath20 ,",
    "we select the time scale in the range [ 2.2 - 3.7 ] where the scaling was more or less constant for a given @xmath15 .",
    "note that this corresponds to variations in a time span of @xmath21 \\sim [ 158 - 5012]$ ] * hours * , for a given @xmath15 . in this range ,",
    "the slope of the fluctuation curves @xmath20 was calculated for every @xmath15 and for ever station .",
    "the mean of the generalized exponents @xmath20 over all the twenty eight stations along with the standard deviation bars are shown in fig .",
    "[ plate2](a ) .",
    "it can be noted from fig .",
    "[ plate2](a ) that the slopes @xmath20 decrease as the moment @xmath15 varies from negative to positive values which signifies that wind speed fluctuations are heterogeneous and thus , a range of exponents is necessary to completely describe their scaling properties . to capture this notion of multifractality",
    ", we estimate the classical renyi exponents @xmath22 and the singularity spectrum @xcite under the assumption of binomial multiplicative process @xcite ( see appendix a for details ) .",
    "the singularity spectrum of one of the representative stations ( baker , 1n ) is shown in fig.[plate1](d ) and its variation across the 28 stations is shown in fig .",
    "[ plate2](b ) .",
    "the fitting parameters @xmath23 for the cascade model , the hurst exponent @xmath24 and the multifractal width @xmath25 for all the stations are summarized in table 1 .",
    ".names and locations of the 28 recording stations .",

    "earlier studies @xcite have suggested the choice of random shuffled surrogates to rule out the possibility that the observed fractal structure is due to correlations as opposed to broad probability distribution function .",
    "the wind speeds in the present study follow a two - parameter asymmetric weibull distribution whose parameters were also similar across the 28 stations .",
    "mf - dfa on the random shuffle surrogates of the original records",
    "fig.[plate2](d ) indicate a scaling of the form @xmath28 with varying @xmath15 , characteristic of random noise and loss of multifractal structure .",
    "the width of the multifractal spectrum was used to characterize the strength of multifractality .",
    "the histogram of the multifractal widths obtained across the 28 stations , fig .",
    "[ plate2](c ) , was narrow with mean and standard deviation @xmath29 .",
    "the multifractal widths and the hurst exponent @xmath24 across the twenty eight stations is also shown in fig.[mfwidths ] .    in the present study",
    "a systematic approach was used to determine possible scaling in the temporal wind - speed records over 28 spatially separated stations in the state of north dakota . despite the spatial expanse and contrasting topography the multifractal qualitative characteristics of the wind speed records as reflected by singularity spectrum , were found to be similar .",
    "thus multifractality may be an invariant feature in describing the dynamics long - term motion of wind speed records in abl over north dakota .",
    "we also believe that the irregular recurrence and confluence of the air masses from polar , gulf of mexico and the northern pacific may play an important role in explaining the observed multifractal structure .",
