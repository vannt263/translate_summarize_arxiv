    "the nature of ultra - luminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) discovered by _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ surveys of nearby galaxies remains highly controversial ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "ulxs appear as point - like , non - nuclear x - ray sources characterised by extremely high x - ray luminosities ( @xmath0 erg s@xmath1 ) compared to _",
    "galactic _ x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) @xcite .    making seemingly reasonable assumptions that ulxs",
    "emit radiation isotropically and that they are eddington limited , one might naturally conclude that ulxs harbour the long - sought intermediate - mass black holes ( imbhs ) whose masses are @xmath2  m@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "if imbhs exist , they would be too light to plunge to the centres of their host galaxies via dynamical friction , but would be massive enough to power ulx luminosities .",
    "ngc 5408 x-1 is one of the brightest ulxs , with a well - determined x - ray luminosity of @xmath4erg  s@xmath1 in the 0.310 kev band @xcite .",
    "presently , this source is one of the best imbh candidates , with mass estimates well in excess of 100  m@xmath5 , but possibly up to 9000  m@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "such large range of uncertainty in the mass must surely be a cause for concern .",
    "this is particularly true given that a number of studies have suggested that ulxs may merely be stellar - mass black hole binaries ( bhbs ) that exhibit super - eddington accretion which can be achieved via beaming of the emission , super - critical mass accretion , or a combination of both @xcite .    as a prime example of the difficulty in using the x - ray luminosity to pin down the black hole mass ,",
    "consider the case of ss  433 , a remarkable galactic x - ray source and the prototypical micro - quasar  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "ss  433 very likely contains a total mass @xmath6 40 m@xmath5 , with a @xmath6 4 m@xmath5 black hole as the compact accretor @xcite , and with the bulk of its energy output mechanically beamed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , supporting evidence for the stellar - mass black hole scenario lies in the relativistic jets which precess with a 162-day period about the binary orbital axis .",
    "in addition , there are well - studied massive outflows due to hyper - eddington mass transfer @xcite .",
    "the jet itself has a kinetic luminosity @xmath7 10@xmath8  erg  s@xmath1 , which exceeds the observed @xmath9 by a factor of @xmath10 .",
    "however , its high orbital inclination obscures the intrinsic x - ray brightness from direct view .",
    "all of this together suggests that if viewed externally and at lower inclination , ss  433 would be bright enough to appear as a ulx @xcite . under these circumstances",
    "it would be miscategorised as an imbh  @xcite .",
    "model - independent system mass estimates are possible in galactic x - ray binaries based on their kinematics @xcite . in the case of ss  433 ,",
    "the mass of the x - ray emitting accretor plus the accretion disc is @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "however , such system mass estimates have not yet been possible for any extragalactic ulx .",
    "recently , a case for an imbh in ngc 5408 x-1 has been made , citing its principal observed property of an extremely high @xmath12 and the presence of a low - frequency quasi - periodic oscillation ( qpo ) .",
    "the x - ray luminosity alone implies a black hole mass of @xmath6 100  m@xmath5 if we assume that the ulx is radiating at the eddington limit . adding weight to the interpretation that this source is an extreme form of high mass x - ray binary",
    ", there is a recent discovery of a 115-day modulation in the x - ray flux .",
    "@xcite interpreted this modulation as the binary orbital period for a system with a @xmath6 1000 m@xmath5 black hole for the primary component and a 35  m@xmath5 giant or supergiant star for the secondary component .    in examining the properties of ngc 5408 x-1 , we suggest here that it may be instructive to make further comparisons with ss  433 .",
    "both sources are known to be engulfed in photo - ionised , steep - spectrum radio nebulae of similar size @xcite , strongly favouring the presence of optically - thin synchrotron emission powered by an accreting black hole over x - ray emission from a supernova remnant ( snr ) . and",
    "both may have formed from hmxbs undergoing mass transfer on a thermal time - scale @xcite .",
    "this raises the question of whether ngc 5408 x-1 may be more similar to ss  433 than previously realised .",
    "there now exists an extensive observational database for ss  433 , particularly for its precessing jets @xcite , and we investigate here whether its properties are sufficiently similar to those of ngc 5408 x-1 to consider them both part of the same population .",
    "ngc 5408 is a dwarf irregular galaxy at a distance of 4.8  mpc @xcite .",
    "@xcite discovered radio emission at the position of the ulx ngc 5408 x-1 , and they found that the x - ray , optical , and radio fluxes were consistent with beamed emission from a relativistic jet of an accreting stellar - mass black hole ( although they could not rule out jet emission from an imbh . ) however , subsequent radio observations @xcite showed that , in fact , the radio emission was too extended ( 15 @xmath13 20 , or @xmath14  pc ) to be associated with relativistic jets and was more likely optically thin synchrotron emission from a surrounding nebula .    because the ulx is located in a relatively unobscured and uncrowded region , its optical counterpart has been identified @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that ngc 5408 x-1  is confined within a photo - ionised nebula ( of size @xmath15 30 pc ) displaying strong high - excitation emission lines of he  ii @xmath164686 and [ ne  v ] @xmath163426 . the optical continuum emission of the counterpart was weak and there were no absorption features present that might be associated with the donor s photosphere , thereby precluding a kinematic study ( cf .",

    "a potentially crucial feature of this ulx is the presence of a low frequency ( @xmath17 10 mhz ) quasi - periodic oscillation ( qpo ) in the soft x - ray band . @xcite .",
    "the physical origin of such qpos remains controversial @xcite .",
    "however , qpo phenomenology has been studied over the last decade , and it is commonly assumed that the black hole mass is inversely proportional to the qpo frequency at a given value of the power - law spectral index @xcite . given this assumption , the observed qpo frequency suggests a black hole mass well in excess of 1000  m@xmath5 , possibly as high as 9000 m@xmath5  @xcite .",
    "if these properties were confirmed , then ngc 5408 x-1 would indeed be a remarkable and extremely important object for black hole population studies .",
    ".comparing qpo frequency , p@xmath18 , and m@xmath19 in bhbs . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      a twenty - year baseline of many optical photometric and spectroscopic campaigns has revealed multiple periodicities in ss  433 : a well- established orbital period of @xmath20 = 13.07  d @xcite , a precessional period @xmath21 = 162.375  d @xcite , and a nutation period @xmath22 = 6.3  d @xcite due to a periodic torque produced by the secondary component which does not affect the mean precession rate but does produce an instantaneous oscillation in the precession with a period of about one - half the orbital period @xcite .",
    "ss  433 has an observed x - ray luminosity of @xmath23 erg s@xmath1 , but as an eclipsing binary , it has a high inclination and fits the description of a classic _ accretion disc corona _ ( adc ) source @xcite ; the obscuration by the disc implies that the intrinsic @xmath9 is a factor 10@xmath24 higher .",
    "the observed kinetic luminosity in the jets is in the range @xmath25 erg s@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , this kinetic luminosity is already larger ( possibly very much so ) than the eddington luminosity for a @xmath6 10  m@xmath5 black hole .",
    "the mass ejection rate from the jets is @xmath26 yr@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "ss  433 is located at the centre of the supernova remnant w50 whose size is @xmath27",
    "1.5@xmath28  across its largest dimension , corresponding to @xmath29 64 pc at its distance of 5.5 kpc @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that this is comparable in extent to that of the ngc 5408 x-1 optical nebula .",
    "w50 has long been known to exhibit `` ears '' that align with the ss  433 jets , perhaps caused by the strong outflowing wind velocity of @xmath29 1500  km  s@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "these winds may be driven by hyper - eddington accretion onto the black hole at @xmath30 ( begelman et al .",
    "2006 ; see also fig",
    ". 9 of shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) .",
    "such a hyper - accreting object will generate a mechanically beamed accretion luminosity @xcite .",
    "consequently , most of the light is geometrically collimated into a cone along the outflow axis with a solid angle @xmath31 that can not be estimated _ a priori _ , since its inverse determines the apparent luminosity . for consistency with the number of progenitor high mass x - ray binaries in the milky way , it is assumed that @xmath32 for ss  433  @xcite .",
    "a 1155 modulation was detected in the x - ray flux of ngc 5408 x-1 with the _ swift_/x - ray telescope and was interpreted as being orbital in origin @xcite . since the stability of this modulation has not yet been established , this conclusion was largely based on the assertion that 115 days is shorter than all other known superorbital periods for stellar mass bhbs in the galaxy . however , it is not substantially less than the well - established superorbital precession period for ss  433 .",
    "in fact , the question of whether there is significant overlap in the orbital timescales of black holes and neutron stars remains unanswered to date .",
    "superorbital periods in neutron stars are known to range from tens to hundreds of days @xcite  in some cases even longer than the 115 days in ngc 5408 x-1 @xcite .",
    "taking into account that there are considerably more known neutron star binaries than bhbs , that there are a comparatively small number of known , persistently bright black hole candidates , and that there are _ several _ mechanisms to explain these periodicities ( i.e. the kozai mechanism , radiation - driven disc warping , etc . ;",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the need for a comprehensive statistical analysis of the orbital timescales in neutron stars and black holes is apparent .",
    "so far , the modulation period in ngc 5408 x-1 has only been determined to @xmath33 4  days as a result of the small number of cycles sampled .",
    "we note that if the 115 d modulation is orbital , then longer observing baselines will define this more and more precisely , whereas a superorbital modulation ( such as for ss  433 ) will suffer an intrinsic phase jitter . at this time",
    ", the observations can not distinguish between the two interpretations and we propose here that the modulation is instead superorbital in origin and hence similar to ss  433 .",
    "for galactic bhbs with high eddington ratios ( @xmath34 ) , there exist kinematic data that constrain their masses to be @xmath6 1015 m@xmath5 ( e.g. grs 1915 + 105 , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , for ulxs there is no such dynamical information due to their extreme optical faintness and lack of direct detection of the donor .",
    "therefore , we must use indirect methods .    under the assumption that they are signatures of keplerian orbits of the material in the inner accretion flow , low - frequency qpos",
    "have been used to infer the masses of the primary components of bhbs .",
    "this line of enquiry seems promising in light of more recent work @xcite , although the techniques involved have thus far only been applied to a small number of stellar - mass black holes ( m@xmath35 @xmath6 5@xmath1315 m@xmath5 ) , so the range of masses sampled is low .",
    "ngc 5408 x-1 is a ulx whose observed properties suggest two different masses for its compact accretor .",
    "the @xmath9 alone implies a @xmath6 100  m@xmath5 black hole if we assume a high eddington ratio . yet",
    ", this ulx exhibits a low - frequency qpo in its soft flux , suggesting the presence of an imbh of mass 2000@xmath135000 m@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "however , similar low - frequency oscillations have been observed in galactic binaries that are well - established _ stellar - mass _ binary systems ( see table 1 ) .",
    "for example , grs 1915 + 105 exhibits low - frequency qpos @xmath6 0.001@xmath1310  hz @xcite and cygnus x-1 has low - frequency qpos @xmath6 0.04@xmath130.07  hz @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the sample of stellar mass bhbs used to determine the scaling relationship ( which is based on the range of the best - fitting power - law slopes in their reference sample of sources ) for ngc 5408 x-1 in @xcite uses systems with known stellar - black - hole masses whose observed eddington fraction is much higher than would be the case for ngc 5408 x-1 if its black hole has a mass of 5000  m@xmath5 ( as predicted in strohmayer & mushotzky 2009 ) and therefore @xmath36 erg s@xmath1 .",
    "the observed @xmath37 erg s@xmath1 is only @xmath6 2% @xmath38 and this may not be reasonable given the environment of this ulx and the apparently steady flux level .",
    "therefore , one should exercise caution when using the presence of low - frequency qpos to infer black - hole masses",
    ".      two distinct effects of super - eddington mass transfer can cause the x - ray luminosity to exceed the eddington limit .",
    "first , the disc accretion luminosity has an additional , logarithmic component due to the inner transition region : @xmath39\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which could enhance the luminosity by as much as 5@xmath1310 times @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "secondly , the luminosity is modified by mechanical ( i.e. geometrical , non - relativistic ) beaming , resulting in collimation by a factor @xmath40 ( typically  @xmath7  0.1 ) : @xmath41\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xcite .",
    "hence it should not be considered surprising that x - ray emitting binaries can exceed @xmath42 by as much as an order of magnitude in certain circumstances .    a key point to consider",
    "is that for ss  433 , a system with mass ratio _",
    "@xmath44 1 , the inferred mass transfer rate ( @xmath6 10@xmath45  m@xmath5  yr@xmath1 ) requires that it is in a very short - lived phase @xcite .",
    "the clear implications are that either such systems are very rare , or their mass transfer rates are highly variable and/or the systems are very young , being located in star - forming regions .",
    "the observed modulation in the x - ray flux of ngc 5408 x-1 is @xmath46% , depending on energy .",
    "roughly the same levels of modulation were observed in ss  433 @xcite .",
    "these energy - dependent modulations in both ss  433 and ngc 5408 x-1 could be a common feature of such systems , and the spectral effects are perhaps simply related to the orientation of the precessing discs relative to our line of sight .",
    "figure [ lightcurvehard ] illustrates the relationship between the modulation and hardness ratio for ss  433 .",
    "the relative flatness of the hardness ratio for ss  433 compared with that of ngc 5408 x-1 ( cf . figs . 3 and 4 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may be accounted for by the difference in viewing angle ; that is , ss  433 is an adc source whose spectrum is modified by its obscuring corona but the same effect is less pronounced in ngc 5408 x-1 because of its lower inclination .",
    "notably , the effect of absorption and emission of x - rays by a partially ionised wind from a companion star was suggested as a link between the energy - dependent amplitudes of the 115-day modulation and the orbital period of the system @xcite ; however , the same effect should be present in the case of ss  433 but is not .",
    "also , the effect of beaming could concentrate the soft emission , which would explain the softening of the emission in ngc 5408 x-1 that occurs when the source brightens as a result of its assumed precession @xcite .",
    "we suggest , therefore , that the 115-day periodicity found by @xcite for ngc 5408 x-1 is more likely superorbital in nature and similar to ss  433 .",
    "this has implications for the determination of the black hole mass in ulxs , significantly reducing the mass needed to produce the observed properties .    ) for ss  433 , plotted against precession phase ( horizontal axis ) .",
    "_ bottom panel _ : asm hardness ratio , defined as c - band  /  ( a - band + b - band ) , versus precession phase .",
    "the precession period is 162 days @xcite.,width=302 ]",
    "if the nature of the ultra - luminous x - ray source ( ulx ) ngc 5408 x-1 is similar to that of the galactic microquasar ss  433 , then this ulx may be best described as an extragalactic high mass x - ray binary undergoing mass transfer at or near the eddington rate , but at a lower inclination than would be typically seen in an accretion disc corona source @xcite .",
    "this would mean that in the case of ngc 5408 x-1 , we are viewing the hot inner accretion flow , substantially boosting the apparent brightness of this source .",
    "the 115 day periodicity could be due to precession of the inner - disc / jet of ngc 5408 x-1 , similar to ss  433 , and not necessarily the orbital period as assumed in @xcite .    with _ chandra _ or _ xmm - newton _ , the best currently - available x - ray imaging telescopes , the count rate is typically too low to resolve the nature of the 115-day modulation in ngc 5408 x-1 .",
    "settling this will be possible with a next - generation x - ray facility that has a greater collecting area .",
    "indeed , it is certainly possible that the entire class of ulxs are merely high mass x - ray binaries that are undergoing super - critical mass accretion onto a stellar - mass black hole , substantial beaming , or a combination of both .",
    "if we can confirm that ngc 5408 x-1 does contain a stellar - mass black hole , the link between ulxs and intermediate - mass black holes will have been severely challenged .",
