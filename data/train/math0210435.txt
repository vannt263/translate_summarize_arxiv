    "let @xmath1 be a curve over a finite extension @xmath2 of @xmath3 , which is @xmath0-split degenerate , for @xmath0 the residue field .",
    "it is well known that such curve admits a @xmath4-adic uniformization by a @xmath4-adic schottky group @xmath5 acting on the bruhat - tits tree @xmath6 .",
    "we associate @xmath7-algebras to certain subgraphs @xmath8 of the bruhat - tits tree and construct corresponding dynamical cohomologies @xmath9 that resemble the construction at arithmetic infinity given in @xcite .",
    "we introduce a dirac operator @xmath10 , which depends on the graded structure of the dynamical cohomology , in such a way that the data @xmath11 give a spectral triple in the sense of connes .",
    "we recover , from a certain family of zeta functions associated to the spectral triple , the local euler factor @xmath12 of the curve @xmath1 , in the form of a regularized determinant as computed by deninger .",
    "the advantage of this construction is that it provides , in the case we are considering , a natural geometric interpretation , in terms of dynamics of walks on the graph @xmath13 , of the infinite dimensional cohomology theory introduced by deninger .",
    "we propose a way of extending the construction to the case where the curve is not @xmath0-split degenerate , by enlarging the dual graph of the special fiber by new edges , in such a way that we also obtain embeddings in the dynamical cohomology of the first cohomology group of the components of the special fiber .",
    "we begin by recalling some generalities about graphs that we will use throughout the paper .    a _ directed graph _ @xmath14 consists of data @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the set of vertices , @xmath17 is the set of oriented edges @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is an edge of the graph and @xmath20 is a choice of orientation .",
    "the set @xmath21 consists of a choice of orientation for each edge , namely one element in each pair @xmath22 .",
    "the maps @xmath23 are the range and source maps , and @xmath24 is the involution on @xmath17 defined by @xmath25 .    a morphism @xmath26 of directed graphs @xmath14 and @xmath27 consists of maps @xmath28 and @xmath29 which satisfy @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , for @xmath33 .",
    "the morphism @xmath26 is a monomorphism if the @xmath34 are invertible , for @xmath33 .",
    "this defines the automorphism group of a directed graph , which we denote @xmath35 .",
    "a morphism @xmath26 of directed graphs is a covering map if the @xmath34 are onto , for @xmath33 , and @xmath36 gives a bijection @xmath37 and the same with respect to the range map .",
    "a directed graph is finite if @xmath16 and @xmath17 are finite sets .",
    "it is _ row finite _ if at each vertex @xmath38 there are at most finitely many edges @xmath39 in @xmath21 such that @xmath40 .",

    "similarly , we introduce the analogous notation @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 for paths .",
    "we shall drop the explicit mention of the graph @xmath14 in the notation for walks and paths , when no confusion arises .",
    "we denote by @xmath54 the set of paths that end at a sink .",
    "a directed graph is a directed tree if , for any two vertices , there exists a unique walk in @xmath55 connecting them .",
    "the universal cover @xmath8 of a connected directed graph @xmath14 , endowed with a choice of a base point @xmath56 , is a directed tree obtained by setting @xmath57 , the set of all walks in @xmath14 that start at @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 .",

    "detailed explanations for the statements we will recall here without proofs are contained in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the description of the vertices of the tree associated to @xmath88 is as follows .",
    "one considers the set of free @xmath89-modules of rank @xmath90 : @xmath91 .",
    "two such modules are _ equivalent _ @xmath92 if there exists an element @xmath93 , such that @xmath94 .",
    "the group @xmath95 of linear automorphisms of @xmath84 operates on the set of such modules _ on the left _ : @xmath96 , @xmath97 .",
    "notice that the relation @xmath92 is equivalent to the condition that @xmath98 and @xmath99 belong to the same orbit of the center @xmath100 .",
    "hence , the group @xmath101 operates ( on the left ) on the set of classes of equivalent modules .",
    "we denote by @xmath102 the set of such classes and by @xmath103 the class of the module @xmath104 .",
    "because @xmath89 is a principal ideals domain and every module @xmath104 has two generators , it follows that @xmath105    the multiplication of @xmath98 and @xmath99 by elements of @xmath2 preserves the inclusion @xmath106 , hence the natural number @xmath107 is well defined .",
    "the graph @xmath6 of the group @xmath88 is the infinite graph with set of vertices @xmath102 , in which two vertices @xmath108 are adjacent and hence connected by an edge if and only if @xmath109 .",
    "the following properties characterize completely @xmath6 and are well known ( _ cf .",
    "_  _ e.g. _  @xcite and @xcite ) .    1 .",
    "the graph @xmath6 is a connected , locally finite tree with @xmath110 edges departing from each of its vertices .",

    "3 .   the group @xmath64 acts ( on the left ) transitively on @xmath102 and it preserves the metric @xmath113 .",
    "the tree @xmath6 is called the bruhat ",
    "tits tree associated to the group @xmath87 .",
    "a _ half - line _ in @xmath6 is an infinite sequence @xmath114 of vertices of @xmath6 _ without repetitions _ such that @xmath115 is adjacent to @xmath116 for all @xmath47 .",

    "it is immediate to verify that the construction described above defines a one - to - one correspondence @xmath127 between equivalence classes of half - lines and elements of @xmath85 .",
    "a schottky group @xmath5 is a subgroup of @xmath88 which is finitely generated and whose elements @xmath128 are _ hyperbolic _ ( _ i.e. _  the eigenvalues of @xmath129 in @xmath2 have different valuation ) .",
    "the group @xmath5 is discrete in @xmath87 , torsion free and acts freely on the tree @xmath6 .",

    "any two points @xmath139 uniquely define their connecting axis whose endpoints lie in the classes described by @xmath140 and @xmath141 in @xmath126 .    any hyperbolic element @xmath135 has two fixed points in @xmath85 .",
    "the unique axis of @xmath6 whose ends are fixed by @xmath129 is called the axis of @xmath129 .",

    "any path without back - tracking beginning on one axis and ending on the other and with no edges in common with either axis is said to be the _ bridge _ between them .",
    "a bridge may consist of a single point , else it is uniquely defined ( figure [ axes ] ) .",
    "for any schottky group @xmath142 there is a smallest _ subtree _ @xmath143 containing the axes of all elements of @xmath5 .",

    "it is obvious that equivalent modules remain equivalent , hence one gets a natural embedding of the sets of vertices @xmath162 .",
    "the isomorphism @xmath163 shows that distance would not , in general , be preserved under field extensions . to eliminate this disadvantage ,",

    "because @xmath173 and the natural embedding @xmath174 is compatible with a concept of @xmath2-direction of exiting from any vertex of @xmath102 , the construction is functorial under finite fields extensions and this process determines , for a fixed schottky group @xmath175 , a projective system @xmath176<\\infty\\}$ ] of schottky - mumford curves .",
