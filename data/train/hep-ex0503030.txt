    "there are some long - standing puzzles in the decays of vector charmonia , in particular the `` @xmath6 puzzle '' between @xmath3 and @xmath7 decays and the possible large charmless decay branching fraction of the @xmath8 . following the suggestion in ref .",
    "@xcite that the small @xmath9 branching fraction is due to the cancellation of the @xmath10- and @xmath11-wave matrix elements in @xmath3 decays , it was pointed out that all @xmath3 decay channels should be affected by the same @xmath10- and @xmath11-wave mixing scheme , and thus , in general , the ratios between the branching fractions of @xmath3 and @xmath7 decay into the same final states may have values different from the `` 12% rule '' , expected for pure @xmath12 and @xmath13 states  @xcite .",
    "this scenario also predicts @xmath8 decay branching fractions since @xmath8 would also be a mixture of @xmath10- and @xmath11-wave charmonia , and it was suggested that many @xmath7 and @xmath3 , as well as @xmath8 , decays should be measured to test this . for the channels that have been measured ,",
    "@xmath3 decays are found to be either suppressed ( like vector - pseudoscalar , vector - tensor ) , or enhanced ( like @xmath14 ) , or obey the 12% rule ( like baryon - antibaryon pairs ) . in this paper , we analyze three - body decays of @xmath3 into a @xmath15 pair and a @xmath16 or @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath7 and @xmath3 decays into @xmath18 and @xmath19 are expected to be dominated by two - body decays involving excited nucleon states .",
    "these states play an important role in the understanding of nonperturbative qcd  @xcite . however , our knowledge on @xmath20 resonances , based on @xmath21 and @xmath22 experiments  @xcite , is still very limited and imprecise .",
    "studies of @xmath20 resonances have also been performed using @xmath7 events collected at the beijing electron - positron collider  ( bepc )  @xcite , which provides a new method for probing @xmath20 physics .",
    "recently , based on 58 million @xmath7 events collected by beijing spectrometer ( besii ) , a new @xmath20 peak with a mass at around 2065  mev/@xmath23 was observed  @xcite .",
    "this may be one of the `` missing @xmath20 states '' around 2  gev/@xmath23 that have been predicted by the quark model in many of its forms  @xcite .",
    "however , due to its large mass , the production of this @xmath24 in @xmath7 decays is rather limited in phase space , and a similar search for it in @xmath3 decays , which has a larger phase space available may be helpful , although the production rate may be small due to the large decay rates for @xmath3 into final states with charmonium .    in a recent paper  @xcite",
