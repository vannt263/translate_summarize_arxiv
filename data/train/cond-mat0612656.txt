    "in spite of many efforts during the last decades , a detailed description of the non - equilibrium dynamics of statistical systems is still lacking .",
    "in addition to disordered and glassy systems  @xcite even simpler ones ( , pure magnets ) have revealed unexpected non - equilibrium dynamical behaviors such as aging  @xcite .",
    "close to _ critical _ points , some aspects of these collective behaviors become largely independent of the microscopic details of the system ( _ universality _ ) and therefore they can be very effectively investigated by means of simplified models , among which field - theoretical ( ft )  @xcite ones . within this approach one studies , for instance , the non - equilibrium relaxation from a state with non - vanishing value @xmath0 of the time - dependent average order parameter @xmath1 ( , the magnetization of a ferromagnet ) .",
    "it turns out  @xcite that , after a non - universal transient , @xmath1 grows in time as @xmath2 for @xmath3 whereas , for @xmath4 , @xmath1 decays algebraically to zero as @xmath5 .",
    "these different time dependences are characterized by the universal exponents @xmath6 ( the so - called initial - slip exponent  @xcite ) and @xmath7 , where @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the usual static and dynamic ( equilibrium ) critical exponents , respectively .",
    "in addition to the actual time dependence of @xmath1 , the _ persistence _ properties of thermal fluctuations @xmath11 around @xmath1 provide useful informations on the dynamics of the system ( especially on its non - markovian nature ) and indeed in recent years they have attracted , in various contexts , considerable attention both theoretically  @xcite and experimentally  @xcite . for a stochastic process @xmath12 with zero mean , the persistence probability @xmath13 is defined as the probability that @xmath14 does not change sign up to time @xmath15 . a related quantity which might be used to characterize",
    "the process is the first - crossing ( or first - passage ) time @xmath16 , defined as the time it takes @xmath14 to change its sign for the first time .",
    "clearly , the probability distribution @xmath17 is related to @xmath13 via @xmath18 . for a ferromagnet at finite temperature @xmath19 the persistence probability of a single spin ( , of the fluctuations of the _ local _ order parameter )",
    "decays always exponentially in time due to fast thermal fluctuations .",
    "the long - time decay of the persistence probability @xmath20 of @xmath21 ( , of the fluctuations of the _ global _ order parameter ) , instead , becomes algebraic upon approaching the critical point : @xmath22 , with a non - trivial exponent @xmath23 .",
    "this exponent was calculated analytically for some ferromagnetic models with different dynamics ( models a and c  @xcite ) and random initial condition  @xcite ( , @xmath24 ) and for reaction - diffusion systems in the directed percolation ( dp ) universality class , initially in the active phase  @xcite ( , @xmath25 on the lattice , where the order parameter is the spatial density of reacting particles ) .",
    "we shall denote @xmath26 and @xmath27 . in the previous cases",
    "analytical progresses rely on the fact that the global fluctuating order parameter @xmath28 has a gaussian distribution for all finite times @xmath15 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "indeed , for a @xmath29-dimensional system of linear size @xmath30 , @xmath31 is given by the sum of @xmath32 random variables ( the _ local _ fluctuating degrees of freedom , , spins in ferromagnets ) which are correlated only across a _",

    "@xmath34 the central limit theorem implies that @xmath28 is a gaussian process , for which powerful tools have been developed in order to determine the persistence exponent  @xcite .",
    "remarkably , under the _ additional _ assumption that the process is markovian , @xmath35 can be related to known critical exponents , via two ( hyper)scaling relations @xmath36 ( where @xmath37 is the fisher exponent ) and @xmath38 which are valid for spin systems and for the dp universality class , respectively . for @xmath24 ( weak ) non - markovian corrections were found at two - loop and one - loop order in a dimensional expansion around @xmath39 , for model a and model c , respectively , in rather good agreement with monte carlo estimates @xmath40 in dimension @xmath41 @xcite and @xmath42 in @xmath43  @xcite .",
    "for completely ordered initial conditions ( @xmath44 ) , instead , these corrections have not been investigated so far beyond the case of dp , where they appear at one - loop order  @xcite and they were measured numerically in @xmath45  @xcite .",
    "these results imply that the average and variance of the first - crossing time @xmath16 are both _",
    "finite _ for dp in @xmath46 but _ not _ for the spin models studied in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the evidence accumulated so far in two different models with @xmath24 and @xmath47 show that the critical persistence properties actually depend on @xmath0 .",
    "it is therefore natural to investigate how the corresponding crossover occurs when @xmath0 is varied within the _ same _ model   ( and no initial fluctuations  they would anyhow relax exponentially fast in time ) correspond to the inactive _ absorbing _ phase . ] and which are the associated _ universal _ features .",
    "here we focus primarily on the ising model ( on a @xmath29-dimensional hypercubic lattice ) with glauber dynamics quenched to its critical point and we study its persistence properties both analytically and numerically",
