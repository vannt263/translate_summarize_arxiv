    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ) saw first light a decade ago , with the goals of obtaining ccd imaging in five broad bands over 10,000 deg@xmath0 of high - latitude sky , and spectroscopy of a million galaxies and one hundred thousand quasars over this same region . with this , its seventh public data release , these goals have been realized .",
    "the survey facilities have also been used to carry out a comprehensive imaging and spectroscopic survey to explore the structure , composition , and kinematics of the milky way galaxy ( sloan extension for galactic understanding and exploration ; segue ; yanny et al .",
    "2009 ) , and a repeat imaging survey that has discovered almost 500 spectroscopically confirmed type ia supernovae with superb light curves ( frieman et al.2008 ; holtzman et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "the sdss uses a dedicated wide - field 2.5 m telescope ( gunn et al .",
    "2006 ) located at apache point observatory ( apo ) near sacramento peak in southern new mexico .",
    "the telescope uses two instruments .",
    "the first is a wide - field imager ( gunn et al .",
    "1998 ) with 24 @xmath3 ccds on the focal plane with @xmath4 pixels , that covers the sky in drift scan mode in five filters in the order @xmath5 ( fukugita et al .  1996 ) .",
    "the imaging is done with the telescope tracking great circles at the sidereal rate ; the effective exposure time per filter is 54.1 seconds , and 18.75 deg@xmath0 are imaged per hour in each of the five filters .",
    "the images are mostly taken under good seeing conditions ( the median is about @xmath6 in @xmath7 ) on moonless photometric nights ( hogg et al .",
    "2001 ) ; the exceptions are a series of repeat scans of the celestial equator in the fall for a supernova search ( frieman et al .",
    "2008 ) , as is described in more detail in ",
    "[ sec : stripe82 ] .",
    "the 95% completeness limits of the images are @xmath8 , respectively ( abazajian et al .",
    "2004 ) , although these values depend as expected on seeing and sky brightness .",
    "the images are processed through a series of pipelines that determine an astrometric calibration ( pier et al .",
    "2003 ) and detect and measure the brightnesses , positions and shapes of objects ( lupton et al . 2001",
    "; stoughton et al .",
    "the astrometry is good to 45 milli - arcseconds ( mas ) rms per coordinate at the bright end , as described in more detail in ",
    "[ sec : astrometry ] .",
    "the photometry is calibrated to an ab system ( oke & gunn 1983 ) , and the zeropoints of the system are known to 12% ( abazajian et al .",
    "the photometric calibration is done in two ways , by tying to photometric standard stars ( smith et al .",
    "2002 ) measured by a separate 0.5-m telescope on the site ( tucker et al .  2006 ; ivezi et al .",
    "2004 ) , and by using the overlap between adjacent imaging runs to tie the photometry of all the imaging observations together , in a process called ubercalibration ( padmanabhan et al .",
    "results of both processes are made available ; with this data release , the ubercalibration results , which are uncertain at the @xmath9 level in @xmath10 and 2% in @xmath11 , are now the default photometry made available in the data release described in this paper .",
    "the photometric catalogs of detected objects are used to identify objects for spectroscopy with the second of the instruments on the telescope : a 640-fiber - fed pair of multi - object double spectrographs , giving coverage from 3800  to 9200  at a resolution of @xmath12 .",
    "the objects chosen for spectroscopic follow - up are selected based on photometry corrected for galactic extinction following schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis ( 1998 ; hereafter sfd ) , and include :    * a sample of galaxies complete to a petrosian ( 1976 ) magnitude limit of @xmath13 ( strauss et al .",
    "2002 ) ; * two deeper samples of luminous red ellipticals selected in color - magnitude space to @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively , which produce an approximately volume - limited sample to @xmath16 , and a flux - limited sample extending to @xmath17 , respectively ( eisenstein et al .",
    "2001 ) ; * flux limited samples of quasar candidates , selected by their non - stellar colors or first ( becker et al .  1995 ) radio emission to @xmath18 in regions of color space characteristic of @xmath19 quasars , and to @xmath20 for quasars with @xmath21 ( richards et al .",
    "2002 ) ; * a variety of ancillary samples , including optical counterparts to rosat - detected x - ray sources ( anderson et al .  2007 ) ; * stars for spectrophotometric calibration and telluric absorption correction , as well as regions of blank sky for accurate sky subtraction ; * a variety of categories of stellar targets with a series of color and magnitude cuts for measurements of radial velocity , metallicity , surface temperature , and galactic structure as part of segue ( yanny et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "these targets are arranged on _",
    "tiles _ of radius @xmath22 , with centers chosen to maximize the number of targeted objects ( blanton et al .",
    "each tile contains 640 objects , and forms the template for an aluminum spectroscopic plate , in which holes are drilled to hold optical fibers that feed the spectrographs .",
    "spectroscopic exposures are 15 minutes long , and three or more are taken for a given plate to reach pre - defined requirements of signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) , namely @xmath23 per 1.5  pixel for stellar objects of fiber magnitude @xmath24 and @xmath25 . for the segue",
    "faint plates , the exposures are considerably deeper , and typically consist of eight 15-minute exposures , giving @xmath26 at the same depth ( yanny et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "spectra are extracted and calibrated in wavelength and flux .",
    "the typical s / n of a galaxy near the main sample flux limit is 10 per pixel .",
    "the broad - band spectrophotometric calibration is accurate to 4% rms for point sources ( adelman - mccarthy et al .",
    "2008 ) , and the wavelength calibration is good to 2 @xmath27 .",
    "the spectra are classified and redshifts determined using a pair of pipelines ( stoughton et al .  2002 ; subbarao et al .",
    "2002 ) , which give consistent results 98% of the time ; the discrepant objects tend to be of very low s / n , or very unusual objects , such as extreme bals , superposed sources , and so on .",
    "the vast majority of the spectra of galaxies and quasars yield reliable redshifts ; the failure rate is of order 1% for galaxies , and slightly larger for quasars .",
    "the stellar targets are further processed by a separate pipeline ( lee et al .  2008a , b ; allende prieto et al .",
    "2008a ) which determines surface temperatures , metallicities , and gravities .",
    "the resulting catalogs are stored and distributed via a database accessible on the web ( the catalog archive server , cas ; thakar et al .",
    "2008 ) , and the images and flat files are available in bulk through the data archive server ( das ) .",
    "the sdss saw first light in may 1998 , and started routine operations in april 2000 .",
    "it was originally funded for five years of operations , but had not completed its core goals of imaging and spectroscopy of a large contiguous area of the northern galactic cap by 2005 .",
    "the survey was extended for an additional three years , with the additional goals of the segue and the supernova surveys mentioned above .",
    "the extended program is known as sdss - ii , and the component of sdss - ii that represents the completion of sdss - i is known as the legacy survey .",
    "sdss - ii observations were completed in july 2008 .",
    "the sdss data have been made public in a series of yearly data releases ( stoughton et al .",

    "adelman - mccarthy et al .  2007 , 2008 ; hereafter the edr , dr1 , dr2 , dr3 , dr4 , dr5 , and dr6 papers , respectively ) .",
    "the most recent of these papers described the sixth data release ( dr6 ) , which included data taken through july 2006 .",
    "the present paper describes the seventh data release ( dr7 ) , including data taken through the end of sdss - ii in 2008 july , and thus represents two additional years of data .",
    "the data releases are cumulative ; dr7 includes all data included in the previous releases as well . in ",

    "1,440,961 +    the imaging for the legacy survey was substantially complete with dr6 . in dr7",
    ", we include imaging of a few small gaps that were missed in the contiguous region of the north galactic cap , and repeat observations of a few regions of the sky which had particularly poor seeing in previous data releases .",
    "the total footprint has increased by less than 10 deg@xmath0 in total .",
    "the legacy imaging footprint is visible as the large contiguous gray area on the left side of the upper panel of figure  [ fig : skydist ] , together with the three gray stripes visible on the right side .",
    "the principal augmentation of the imaging data in dr7 are the stripes which are part of the segue survey .",
    "they are indicated in red in the figure , and increase the sdss imaging footprint by roughly 2000 deg@xmath0 over dr6 .",
    "note that many of these cross the galactic plane ( indicated by the sinuous line crossing the figure ) .",
    "unlike dr6 , the union of the legacy and segue data are now available in a single database in cas in dr7 .",
    "these data have been recalibrated using ubercalibration ( padmanabhan et al.2008 ) using the overlap between adjacent scans ; the resulting photometry is now the default photometry found in the cas .",
    "we also make available the original photometry calibrated by the auxiliary photometric telescope ( tucker et al .",
    "the ubercalibration solution was regenerated using all the imaging data , but the changes are tiny from the ubercalibration results published in dr6 : 0.001 mag rms in @xmath10 and 0.003 mag in @xmath11 .",
    "the ubercalibrated photometry zeropoints are defined to be the same as that measured from the photometric telescope .",
    "the green and blue patches indicate supplementary imaging stripes , which contain scans over m31 or in its halo , through the center of the perseus cluster of galaxies , over the low - latitude globular cluster m71 , near the south galactic pole , along the orbit of the sagittarius tidal stream , and through the star - forming regions of orion ( finkbeiner et al .",
    "in addition , there are a number of scans at angles perpendicular , or at an oblique angle , to the regular legacy or segue imaging stripes .",
    "these scans are used in the ubercalibration procedure to tie the zeropoints of the stripes together and to determine the flat - fields .",
    "the lower panel in figure  [ fig : skydist ] shows the coverage of spectroscopy in dr7 ; the light gray area shows the increment in the legacy survey over dr6 .",
    "most importantly , the gap cutting the north galactic cap in two pieces in previous data releases has been closed ; we now have complete spectroscopy of our principal galaxy and quasar targets over a contiguous area of roughly 7500 deg@xmath0 .",
    "an additional dozen plates were observed to fill holes in the nominally contiguous regions in dr6 .",
    "adding in the three stripes in the southern galactic cap , the legacy spectroscopy footprint is 8032 deg@xmath0 , a 26% increment over dr6 .",
    "in addition , spectroscopy was carried out using a series of target selection algorithms designed to find stars of a wide variety of types as part of the segue project ( dr6 paper ; yanny et al .",
    "these targets were drawn from both the segue and legacy imaging , and are shown in red in the lower panel of figure  [ fig : skydist ] . as some of these are lost in the density of legacy spectra , we show the distribution of segue and other non - legacy spectra in galactic coordinates in figure  [ fig : skydist_segue ] .    finally , as described in yanny et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , we carried out spectroscopy of stars in 12 open and globular clusters to calibrate the measurements of stellar parameters in segue ( lee et al .",
    "2008a , b ) .",
    "many of these clusters are sufficiently close that the giant branches are brighter than the photometric saturation limit of sdss , so the targets for these plates were selected from the literature .",
    "indeed , the spectrographs would saturate as well with our standard 15-minute exposures , so these observations had individual exposure times as short as one or two minutes . without proper flux calibrators or exposure of bright sky lines to set the zeropoint of the wavelength scale ,",
    "the spectrophotometry and wavelength calibration of the spectra on these plates are often quite inferior to that of the main survey , and these plates are available only in the das , not the cas .",
    ", width=453 ]    as described in more detail below , the @xmath33 stripe centered on the celestial equator was imaged multiple times throughout sdss and sdss - ii .",
    "each 2.5@xmath2 wide stripe is observed by a pair of offset _ strips _ to cover the full width ( york et al .",
    "2000 ) ; the coverage of the two strips of stripe 82 is shown in figure  [ fig : stripe82 ] .",
    "the data are shown both for the subset of data included in a deep coaddition ( lower set of curves ;   [ sec : coadd ] ) , and all scans , including those taken under non - ideal conditions for the supernova survey (   [ sec : stripe82 ] ; frieman et al .",
    "the sdss imaging survey was primarily designed to give a single pass across the sky , thus in the cas , each photometric measurement is flagged either primary or secondary .",
    "primary objects designate a unique set of detections ( i.e. , without duplicates ) using the geometric boundaries of survey stripes .",
    "the set of secondary objects includes repeat observations of the same object in overlapping strips an stripes .",
    "primary objects are associated with a run and field which is the primary source of imaging data at that position . in dr7 ,",
    "the union of the legacy and segue footprints serves as the primary footprint ; a quantity inlegacy in the fieldqa table in cas indicates those objects which lie within the original legacy northern galactic cap survey ellipse , as defined in york et al .",
    "legacy imaging can also be distinguished by the stripe number for each run ; stripes 9 - 44 , 76 , 82 and 86 are in the legacy survey , all others are segue stripes or other miscellaneous pieces of sky ( figure  [ fig : skydist ] ) .    while resolving the sky into a seamless primary region of unique detections of objects",
    "is ideal for many science queries , it is sometimes convenient to query data by run without regard to the way the survey resolves overlaps and imposes the boundaries of the edge of the survey .",
    "these boundaries are restricted to matched pairs of north and south strips in the main dr7 cas .",
    "therefore in many runs , several fields at the beginning or end which do not have a match in the corresponding other strip are not included in the main cas .",
    "thus we have now made available a separate runs database within the cas , which includes _ all _ fields in all runs , and which allows one to query objects by which run they are imaged in .",
    "the runs database contains 530 complete runs from sdss - i and sdss - ii , where primary is set strictly based on geometric limits within each scan , regardless of overlapping runs or stripes .",
    "the runs database also contains several scans outside the regular dr7 legacy or segue footprints .",
    "for example , stripe 205 is covered by runs 4334 , 4516 , 6751 and 6794 , and follows the sagittarius stream , which is in three pieces , the first running from @xmath34 to @xmath35 , the second centered at @xmath36 , and the last ( overlapping several other runs ) which ends at @xmath37 .",
    "the sdss stripe along the celestial equator in the southern galactic cap ( `` stripe 82 '' ) was imaged multiple times in the fall months .",
    "this was first carried out to allow the data to be stacked to reach fainter magnitudes , and through fall 2004 , these data were taken only under optimal seeing , sky brightness , and photometric conditions ( i.e. , the conditions required for imaging in the legacy survey ; york et al .",
    "there were 84 such runs made public in previous data releases . in fall 2005 , 2006 , and 2007 ,",
    "219 additional imaging runs were taken on stripe 82 as part of the sdss supernova survey ( frieman et al .",
    "2008 ) , often under less optimal conditions : poor seeing , bright moonlight , and/or non - photometric conditions .",
    "these data have been photometrically calibrated following the prescription of bramich et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , whereby the photometry of bright stars is tied to that of photometric data on a field - by - field basis ( see ivezi et al .",
    "2007 for a similar approach ) .",
    "bramich et al .",
    "solved for photometric offsets both parallel and perpendicular to the scan direction in data from a given ccd ; we found that the term perpendicular to the scan direction added little , and we did not include it here .",
    "as bramich et al .",
    "( 2008 ) show , the resulting photometric calibration is good to 0.02 mag at the bright end in up to 1 mag of atmospheric extinction . of course ,",
    "under non - optimal conditions , these data will not necessarily reach as deep as normal survey images .",
    "sdss judges photometricity of a given night by monitoring fluctuations in the night sky measured by a wide area infrared camera ( the `` cloud camera '' ) sensitive at 10@xmath38 m , where clouds are emissive ( hogg et al .",
    "if the sky fluctuations are small and constant , then the night is photometric .",
    "clouds cause the fluctuations to increase .",
    "plots of cloud cover and seeing for most nights on which stripe 82 was observed are available as part of the dr7 web documentation listing all stripe 82 scans .",
    "in addition , for those runs which the cloud camera indicated as non - photometric , we examined the fluctuations in the zeropoint for each ccd in the camera as a function of time using the photometric calibration procedure of bramich et al .",
    "these zeropoint values are available in the cas ; rms variations of more than 0.1 mag are an indication of considerable variable cloud cover , and a value of more than 1 magnitude suggests that the approximate calibration procedure of bramich et al .",
    "( 2008 ) breaks down , and the resulting photometry should be regarded with caution .",
    "all 303 runs covering stripe 82 are made available as part of the stripe82 database , which is structured like the runs database .",
    "we have carried out a coaddition of the repeat imaging scans on stripe 82 taken through fall 2005 under the best conditions ( see below ) .",
    "the coaddition includes a total of 122 runs , covering any given piece of the @xmath28 deg@xmath0 area between 20 and 40 times ( figure  [ fig : stripe82 ] ) , and the results are made available in the stripe82 database as well .",
    "the coaddition runs are designated 100006 ( south strip ) and 200006 ( north strip ) respectively in the das , and 106 and 206 in the cas .",
    "the coaddition is described in detail in annis et al .",
    "( 2009 ) ; see also jiang et al .",
    "( 2008 ) . from the list of runs on stripe 82 taken through the fall 2005 season , all fields with seeing in the @xmath7 band worse than @xmath39 fwhm ,",
    "@xmath7-band sky brightness brighter than 19.5 magnitudes in one square arcsecond , or whose photometric correction  la bramich et al .",
    "( 2008 ; see above ) was greater than 0.2 mags were excised ; this rejected 32% of the available data .",
    "the individual runs were remapped onto a uniform astrometric coordinate system . interpolated pixels in each individual run ( e.g. ,",
    "for bad columns , bleed trails , and cosmic rays ) were masked in the coaddition process .",
    "the sky was subtracted from each frame , and the images coadded with weights for each frame proportional to the transparency and inversely proportional to the square of sky noise and seeing on each frame .",
    "strongly discrepant pixels were clipped in the coaddition .",
    "the effective seeing fwhm is @xmath40 ( for the southern strip of the stripe ) and @xmath41 ( for the northern strip ) .",
    "the resulting coadded images were run through the sdss photometric pipeline , yielding the catalogue made available in the stripe82 database . rather than deriving the point spread function ( psf ) from scratch , we synthesized the psf at each point in the sky by taking the suitably weighted sum of the psfs output by the sdss photometric pipeline from each of the individual runs .",
    "color - color diagrams of stars and counts of stars and galaxies as a function of magnitude demonstrates that the photometry reaches roughly two magnitudes fainter than single sdss scans , similar to what is expected given the number of runs in the coadd .",
    "we have found that star - galaxy separation is improved over that in the single scans , in that the cut can be made closer to the stellar locus . in the main survey ,",
    "objects with @xmath42 are flagged as galaxies in a given band .",
    "however , the stellar peak in the psf  model magnitude difference distribution in the coadd is much narrower , allowing objects with @xmath43 in @xmath7 to be flagged as galaxies .",
    "the coaddition does not properly propagate information on saturated pixels in individual runs , and therefore the photometry of objects brighter than roughly @xmath44 is suspect .",
    "unfortunately , there is no processing flag that one can use to identify such data ; we recommend a simple magnitude cut .",
    "the sdss photometry is quoted in terms of asinh magnitudes , as described by lupton , gunn , & szalay ( 1999 ) , whereby the logarithmic magnitude scale transitions to a linear scale in flux density @xmath45 at low signal - to - noise ratio : @xmath46.\\ ] ] the magnitude at which this transition occurs is set by the quantity @xmath47 , which is roughly the fractional noise in the sky in a psf aperture in @xmath48 seeing ( edr paper ) . here",
    "@xmath49 jy , the zeropoint of the ab flux scale .",
    "the quantity @xmath47 for the coaddition is given in table  [ table : asinh ] , along with the asinh magnitude associated with a zero flux object .",
    "compare with the equivalent numbers for the main survey , given in table 21 of the edr paper .",
    "table  [ table : asinh ] also lists the flux corresponding to @xmath50 , above which the asinh magnitude and the traditional logarithmic magnitude differ by less than 1% in flux .",
    "cccc @xmath11 & @xmath51 & 27.50 & 24.99 + @xmath52 & @xmath53 & 28.42 & 25.91 + @xmath7 & @xmath54 & 27.72 & 25.22 + @xmath55 & @xmath56 & 27.13 & 24.62 + @xmath57 & @xmath58 & 26.08 & 23.57    as with the main survey , it is important to use the various processing flags output by the photometric pipeline ( e.g. , as recommended by richards et al .",
    "2002 ) to reject spurious objects , and to select objects with reliable photometry .",
    "as was noted in the dr6 paper , the sdss imaging pipeline ( photo ) was designed to analyze data at high galactic latitudes , and is not optimized to handle very crowded fields .",
    "the legacy survey is restricted to high latitudes , and photo  performs adequately throughout the legacy footprint . however , at lower latitudes , when the density of stars brighter than @xmath59 grows above 5000 deg@xmath60 , the pipeline is known to fail , as it is unable to find sufficiently isolated stars to measure an accurate psf , and the deblender does poorly with overly crowded images .",
    "many of the segue scans probe these low latitudes ( figure  [ fig : skydist ] ) , and we therefore adapted an alternative stellar photometry code called ps .  developed by the pan - starrs team ( kaiser et al .",
    "2002 ; magnier 2006 ) to be used for these runs . in brief",
    ", we first run this code , and then run photo   using the list of objects detected by ps .  as input to help photo s object finder in crowded regions .",
    "this approach thus provides two sets of photometry at low latitudes .    like e.g. , daophot ( stetson 1987 ) , ps",
    ".  begins with the assumption that every object is unresolved , and therefore does a better job than photo  in crowded stellar regions .",
    "it uses an analytical model based on gaussians to describe the basic psf shape , with parameters which may vary across the field of the image to follow the psf variations .",
    "it also uses a pixel - based representation of the residuals between the psf objects and the analytical model , which is also allowed to vary across each field .",
    "candidate psf stars are selected from the collection of bright objects in the frame by searching for a tight clump in the distribution of second moments . after rejecting outliers ,",
    "the psf fit parameters are used to constrain the spatial variations in the psf model .    unlike photo , ps .",
    "processes each frame separately ( without any requirement of continuity of psf estimation across frame boundaries ) , and each filter separately ( without any requirement that the list of objects between the separate filters agree ) . the pipeline outputs positions and psf magnitudes ( and errors ) for each detected object ; the results are found in the psobjall table in the cas .",
    "the resulting photometry is then matched between filters using a @xmath48 matching radius . while the estimated psf errors output by photo   include a term from the uncertainty in the psf fitting , this component is not included in the errors reported by ps . .",
    "we then run photo , asking it to carry out photometry at the position of each object detected by ps .",
    ", in addition to the positions of objects photo  itself detects .",
    "this allows photo  to do a much better job of distinguishing individual objects in crowded regions .",
    "in addition , the pipeline is fine - tuned to less aggressively look for overlap between adjacent objects , and not to give up as soon as it does at high latitude when faced with deblending large numbers of objects .",
    "we describe below how the photometry directly out of ps . , and that from photo , compare .",

    "if the line is so bright that it is saturated in the individual 15-minute exposures of the spectrograph , it will also appear clipped .",
    "the flux value corresponding to saturation is a function of wavelength , but ranges from 2000 to 10,000 times @xmath133 ( the units in which spectral flux density in reported in the sdss outputs ) .",
    "unfortunately , such saturated pixels are not flagged as such , although usually they are recognizable as having an inverse variance equal to zero .",
    "luckily , objects with such strong emission lines are very rare , but the user should be aware of the possibility of objects with extremely strong emission lines and unphysical or unusual line ratios",
    ".      there have been several improvements made in the segue stellar parameter pipeline ( sspp ; lee et al .  2008a ; 2008b",
    "; allende prieto et al .",
    "2008a ) since the release of dr6 .",
    "in particular , in dr6 , the sspp under - estimated metallicities",
    "( by about 0.3 dex ) for stars approaching solar metallicity .",
    "this was fixed in dr7 by adding synthetic spectra with super - solar metallicities to two of the synthetic grid matching techniques ( ngs1 and ngs2 ) , and by recalibrating the caiik2 , acf , caiit , and annrr methods .",
    "see table 5 in lee et al .",
    "( 2008a ) for the naming convention for each technique .",
    "two new techniques ( annrr and caiik3 ) were also added to the sspp metallicity estimation schemes , and contributed to the high - metallicity performance improvement .",
    "two methods , acf and caiit , have been recalibrated to the  native \" @xmath112 system , instead of making use of calibration on @xmath134 , which required application of an uncertain transformation in color space .",
    "the annrr approach , which also tended to under - estimate metallicity for near - solar metallicity stars , has been re - trained on the sdss / segue spectra with improved stellar parameters , resulting in a better determination of the metallicity for metal - rich stars .",
    "moreover , a neural network approach , based solely on noise - added synthetic spectra , has also been introduced .",
    "there remains a tendency for the sspp to assign slightly higher metallicities for stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath135 .",
    "this offset is presently being calibrated out , and will be corrected in segue-2 ; see below . for more detailed descriptions of individual methods of the sspp",
    ", we refer the interested reader to lee et al .",
    "( 2008a ) .",
    "additionally , the pipeline now identifies cool main sequence stars of low metallicity ( late - k and m subdwarfs ) .",
    "the stars are assigned metallicity classes and spectral subtypes following the classification system of lpine et al .",
    "cool and ultra - cool subdwarfs are classified as subdwarfs ( sdk , sdm ) , extreme subdwarfs ( esdk , esdm ) , and ultrasubdwarfs ( usdk , usdm ) in order of decreasing metal content .",
    "the classification is based on the absolute and relative values of the tio and cah molecular bandstrengths , and derived from fits to k - m dwarf and k - m subdwarf spectral templates .",
    "a number of open and globular clusters have been observed photometrically and spectroscopically with the sdss instruments to evaluate the performance of the sspp ( lee et al .",
    "in addition , high - resolution spectra have been obtained for about 100 field stars included in the sdss , and used to expand the sspp checks over a wider parameter space ( allende prieto et al .",
    "this paper marks the release of the final data of sdss - ii .",
    "the original sdss science goals ( york et al .",
    "2000 ) included five - band imaging over @xmath136 deg@xmath0 with 2% rms errors or better in photometric calibration , and spectroscopy of @xmath137 galaxies and @xmath138 quasars .",
    "we have met these goals , and have in addition carried out extensive stellar spectroscopy of close to half a million stars , and repeat imaging over 250 deg@xmath0 to search for supernovae . over 2200 refereed papers have been published to date using sdss data or results , on subjects ranging from the large - scale distribution of galaxies to distant quasars to substructure in the galactic halo to surveys of white dwarfs to the color distribution of main belt asteroids .      *",
    "segue-2 extends the science goals of segue with the same instrumentation and data processing pipelines , but targets fainter stars to study the distant halo .",
    "it will increase the number of distant halo stars by a factor of 2.5 with respect to the results of sdss and sdss - ii . *",
    "the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ) will perform spectroscopy of 1.5 million luminous red galaxies to @xmath139 and 160,000 quasars with @xmath140 to measure the scale of the baryon oscillation signal in the correlation function as a function of redshift ( schlegel et al .  2007 ) . *",
    "the multi - object apo radial velocity exoplanet large - area survey ( marvels ) will monitor the radial velocities of 11,000 bright stars to search for the signature of planets with periods ranging from several hours to two years ( ge et al .",
    "* the apo galactic evolution experiment ( apogee ) will perform @xmath141 @xmath142-band spectroscopy of @xmath138 giant stars to @xmath143 for detailed radial velocity and chemical studies of the milky way ( majewski et al .",

    "this paper represents the end of sdss - ii , the culmination of a project taking two decades and involving an enormous number of scientists from all over the world .",

    "<S> this paper describes the seventh data release of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , marking the completion of the original goals of the sdss and the end of the phase known as sdss - ii . </S>",
    "<S> it includes 11663 deg@xmath0 of imaging data , with most of the @xmath1 deg@xmath0 increment over the previous data release lying in regions of low galactic latitude . </S>",
    "<S> the catalog contains five - band photometry for 357 million distinct objects . </S>",
    "<S> the survey also includes repeat photometry on a 120@xmath2 long , 2.5@xmath2 wide stripe along the celestial equator in the southern galactic cap , with some regions covered by as many as 90 individual imaging runs . </S>",
    "<S> we include a coaddition of the best of these data , going roughly two magnitudes fainter than the main survey over 250 deg@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the survey has completed spectroscopy over 9380 deg@xmath0 ; the spectroscopy is now complete over a large contiguous area of the northern galactic cap , closing the gap that was present in previous data releases . </S>",
    "<S> there are over 1.6 million spectra in total , including 930,000 galaxies , 120,000 quasars , and 460,000 stars .    </S>",
    "<S> the data release includes improved stellar photometry at low galactic latitude . </S>",
    "<S> the astrometry has all been recalibrated with the second version of the usno ccd astrograph catalog ( ucac-2 ) , reducing the rms statistical errors at the bright end to 45 milli - arcseconds per coordinate . </S>",
    "<S> we further quantify a systematic error in bright galaxy photometry due to poor sky determination ; this problem is less severe than previously reported for the majority of galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we describe a series of improvements to the spectroscopic reductions , including better flat - fielding and improved wavelength calibration at the blue end , better processing of objects with extremely strong narrow emission lines , and an improved determination of stellar metallicities . </S>"
