    "the near - euclidean nature of the universe was one of the main predictions of inflationary cosmology @xcite .",
    "indeed inflationary models actually predict that the curvature radius of the universe should be much larger than the hubble scale @xmath1 ( @xmath2 being the present age of the universe ) , provided enough e - fold occurred .",
    "this leads to a tight prediction on the spatial - curvature parameter @xmath3 @xcite which can only be bypassed at the price of unnatural fine - tuning @xcite . within the @xmath0cdm framework",
    ", the curvature of our universe can be constrained from the observed cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) fluctuations @xcite and current estimations of curvature parameter are achieving impressive accuracy .",
    "for instance planck collaboration @xcite reported @xmath4 when the cmb and some other cosmological data are combined .",
    "these recent results appear as a remarkable evidence in favor of inflationary cosmology @xcite , while the value of the curvature radius of the universe appears as an important and fundamental characteristics of the universe .",
    "the successful standard @xmath0cdm picture is leading to the existence of dominant and unknown dark components : the non - baryonic dark matter and the dark energy , which is used as the generic term for the origin of the accelerated expansion of the universe , as revealed by the hubble diagram of supernovae type ia @xcite . while there is almost no doubt on the reality of the acceleration of the expansion of the universe , its physical origin eludes us .",
    "a large variety of explanations have been proposed : scalar field domination known as quintessence , generalized gravity theory beyond general relativity ( gr ) or inhomogeneous cosmological models .",
    "the present day situation is therefore quite paradoxical : within the simplest framework of gr and @xmath0cdm picture , cosmological parameters can be determined with a few percent accuracy but on the other hand we have little evidence on the validity of this framework .",
    "it is certainly desirable to test the theory at the foundation of our cosmological model @xcite .",
    "the remarkable consistency of the present universe with a spatially flat space and its importance for the theory of inflation , both encourage for a close examination of the actual constraints that can be set and to their connections with the energy contents of the universe . in the standard analyses aimed at measuring cosmological parameters , the approach used does not offer a measurement of the curvature of space , as would provide a purely geometrical test @xcite . as a crucial property of our universe , one would like to measure the spatial geometry of our space in a model - independent way .",
    "the knowledge of the luminosity distance with redshift does not allow to determine spatial curvature of our 3d space @xcite , and should be complemented by the measurement of another observational quantity such as the hubble expansion rate history @xmath5 .",
    "this can be obtained from longitudinal bao @xcite or from the look - back time of the universe @xcite . with the latter method ,",
    "a first estimate of the spatial curvature leads to a result consistent with flatness but with uncertainties of the order of unity @xcite .",
    "as gr implies that the curvature of the universe is related to its energy content , an independent measurement of the latter would allow to test if gr holds at cosmological scales .",
    "given the remarkable accuracy of gr at describing gravity at small scales , it is clearly important to check whether gr actually holds on cosmological scales .",
    "the relation between the curvature and energy contents is precisely such a test of gr at the background level . in the following ,",
    "we focus on how to examine the status of this relation given the quality of relevant cosmological data .",
    "the commonly used metric of a space - time in which 3d spatial slices are homogeneous is the robertson - walker metric : @xmath6 in which @xmath7 is the expansion factor of the universe and @xmath8 is a constant related to the geometry of space .",
    "a value of @xmath9 corresponds to a spherical space , @xmath10 to an euclidean space and @xmath11 to a hyperbolic space . +",
    "the knowledge of the @xmath7 function allows to derive the coordinate @xmath12 : @xmath13 where : @xmath14 and thereby the angular - diameter distance : @xmath15 or equivalently the luminosity distance ( @xmath16 )",
    "[ eq : da ] makes it clear that the knowledge of @xmath17 is not sufficient to infer both the curvature @xmath18 and the dynamical evolution of the expansion @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this leads to a well - known degeneracy between the curvature and a possible evolving dark energy @xcite .",
    "breaking these degeneracies within gr is possible by using different observables , such as for instance growth rate measurements @xcite .",
    "indeed , the dynamic of perturbations may provide information which can not be obtained from the evolution of the background @xcite , allowing to distinguish modified gravity from dark energy models .",
    "the dynamical evolution of the expansion factor @xmath7 is directly related to the energy content of the universe and to the underlying theory of gravity .",
    "it is possible to derive the equation governing @xmath7 in newtonian cosmology , by writing the mechanical energy of a sphere , the radius of which can be taken arbitrarily small ( the full justification relies on the birkhoff - jebsen s theorem ) . because the equation does not depend on the radius , gr should lead exactly to the same equation @xcite .",
    "this equation reads : @xmath19 where the @xmath20 are the energy densities of the different fluids contributing to the gravitational field of the universe and @xmath21 an arbitrary constant .",
    "the normalized curvature parameter @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the hubble parameter @xmath24 , is introduced to quantify the geometry of the universe . in a similar way",
    ", we can define a dynamical quantity : @xmath25 where @xmath26 are the density parameters of the various energy contents of the universe ( @xmath27 ) . in a theory leading to newtonian dynamic for @xmath7 ( eq . [ eq : dynnew ] ) , the relation would be of the form : @xmath28 with @xmath29 being a constant of the theory .    when derived in the frame of gr ,",
    "the constant @xmath21 is not arbitrary anymore but related to the geometric constant @xmath8 found in the robertson - walker metric : @xmath30 i.e. @xmath31 , leading to the well - known friedman - lematre equation which now reads : @xmath32",
    "alternative theories of gravity to gr offer a potential origin for the acceleration of the expansion , and have been thoroughly investigated in recent years . as we have seen that independent measurements of @xmath33 on one side and of the @xmath26 on the other side allow to test the validity of gr .",
    "this test also holds for other theories which would exhibit a different relation between curvature and matter - energy content such as the backreaction models @xcite or some @xmath34 models .",
    "it is clear that these two quantities are physically independent and the prediction of gr is : @xmath35    the hubble expansion factor can now be written as : @xmath36.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    an estimate of curvature of space has been recently obtained @xcite from distance measurements , independently of assumptions about the evolution of dark energy , but still within the context of gr . as we mentioned in the beginning , methods exist for measuring the curvature of our 3d space independently of the underlying theory of gravity by using distances and measurements of the expansion rate @xmath5 , allowing to test the copernican principle by estimating @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "@xmath5 could be inferred from the evolution of redshift with time @xcite , by differentiating the age of the universe @xcite or by baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) measurements @xcite .",
    "the situation is more problematic when one wants to estimate @xmath38 from the observations . in gr",
    "the energy - momentum tensor can be evaluated from the measurement of the local quantities @xmath39 and @xmath40 and their properties .",
    "however , the dark energy fluids are likely to escape to local measurements and their properties can probably be constrained only through observations at cosmological scales .    indeed",
    ", a combination of geometrical observations ( at the background level ) can not provide a way to disentangle the total energy content in distinct components such as pressureless matter and dark energy on the other side . in the absence of local measurements of the content of the universe , densities and pressure ,",
    "we are left with the option to parametrize the observables @xcite .    in the following study",
    ", we therefore adopt a parametrized description of the dynamical contents of the universe and examine whether the prediction of gr is verified .",
    "dark energy fluids are often characterized by their equation of state @xmath41 relating pressure and density : @xmath42 .",
    "the simplest dark energy model is certainly a cosmological constant or equivalently a vacuum contribution , corresponding to @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , we investigate this simple scenario where matter and vacuum make up the contents of the universe and then examine the case of a dark energy component with a constant @xmath44 .",
    "the constraints on the two new parameters of the model , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , are obtained by a minimization of total likelihood @xmath47 with the help of a custom markov chain program .",
    "we start with eight random points in the parameter space and test the convergence of the chains with the gelman - rubin diagnostics @xcite which is based on the comparison of the variance of the parameters inside and between the chains . when convergence is established , the parameters of each step are stored .",
    "for each cell in the @xmath48 parameter space , our program computes the number of chain steps and the minimum @xmath47 inside it .",

    "the expression of the luminosity distance , @xmath50 is modified to introduce the new parameters : @xmath51 the bao resulting from the couplings between the gravitational forces and electromagnetic forces in the primordial plasma produce a specific pattern in both ( the fluctuating part of ) the radiation field and the matter density field .",

    "we have established a simple approach to test gr on cosmological scales at the background level .",
    "this approach provides a new type of constraints on the curvature of space without assuming gr ( but requiring assumptions on dark energy evolution ) and separates clearly the geometrical and the dynamical curvatures .",
    "using the three standard probes , we found interesting constraints when assuming a dark energy component in the form of a vacuum energy ( @xmath75 ) : @xmath80 our estimate on @xmath45 and more importantly its uncertainties , are close to the ones obtained by the planck collaboration for @xmath33 , while the uncertainties on our parameter @xmath46 are noticeably worse .    at this level , however , from our analysis we found that gr is entirely consistent with existing data with little room for any alternative .",
    "this offers a new evidence for the remarkable agreement between the standard gr+@xmath0cdm model in view of and modern data in cosmology .",
    "it is quite remarkable that introducing a new degree of freedom ( i.e. one parameter extension of the @xmath0cdm model ) does not change the basic figures on the properties of our universe in its simplest version .",
    "+ the situation changes drastically when the assumption on dark energy is relaxed .",
    "for example , allowing for an additional dark energy fluid with @xmath81 in the contents of the universe will produce a degeneracy with the actual curvature and will not allow to test directly gr at the background level with this approach .",
    "+ with an arbitrary constant equation of state parameter @xmath44 we found : @xmath82 this considerably enlarges the possibilities with a significant room for alternative theories to standard gr : there is a significant degeneracy between curvature and energy contents .",
    "this may appear somehow not surprising as the determination of the energy contents suffers from a degeneracy problem that has been discussed several times in the past .",
    "however , the situation is quite different from the standard model as the same additional freedom on dark energy @xmath44 does not modify much the constraints .",
    "for instance from wmap7 , bao and sn one gets @xmath83 and @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the limits on @xmath45 that we obtained are similar to those obtained in gr based models without any assumption on dark energy @xcite and similar to those based on model - independent methods @xcite . while similar , our limits on @xmath45 clearly depends on our assumptions on dark energy : constant equation of state @xmath44 ( and the speed of sound equal to unity ) .",
    "the conclusion is quite interesting : relaxing the assumption on dark energy leads to much wider allowed range for @xmath46 with an equation of state for dark energy which is not well constrained , @xmath85 ( 1 @xmath86 ) and with an energy content which is poorly known : @xmath87 ( 1 @xmath86 ) .",
    "it is reasonable to think that more freedom on dark energy will lead to even looser constraints , a question needing further investigation .",
    "+ it is quite remarkable that the standard picture ( gr+@xmath0cdm ) fits so well the present day data while at the same time we do not have enough independent data yet to clarify the nature of dark energy and therefore the appropriateness of the theory of gr .",
    "the true universe may well be much more complicated .",
