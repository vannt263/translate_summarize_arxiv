    "frobenius algebras have wide - ranging applications to geometry , e.g. , to tqfts in @xcite , and are closely related to the string topology batalin - vilkovisky ( bv ) algebra @xcite , as described in e.g.  @xcite .",
    "one motivation for this work is to explain the following algebraic phenomenon : the hochschild cohomology of many interesting frobenius algebras has a bv structure .",
    "for example , this is true for symmetric frobenius algebras , and for preprojective algebras of dynkin quivers ( which are _ not _ symmetric ) .    to explain this , we define _ calabi - yau ( cy ) frobenius algebras _ , whose hochschild cohomology has not only the usual gerstenhaber algebra structure , but a bv structure ( at least when the algebra is also periodic , as we will explain ) .",
    "the cy frobenius property is similar to the cy property of @xcite , but not the same : any frobenius algebra over @xmath0 which is cy in the sense of @xcite must be a direct sum of matrix algebras .",
    "the prototypical example of a cy frobenius algebra @xmath1 _ of dimension @xmath2 _ ( @xmath3 ) over a field @xmath4 is one that has a resolution ( for @xmath5 ) @xmath6 with each @xmath7 a projective @xmath1-bimodule ( the sequence must be exact ) .",
    "our definition is a weakened version of this : @xmath8 in the stable @xmath1-bimodule category ( this notion is recalled in appendix [ gfs ] ) .",
    "any symmetric frobenius algebra has @xmath9 , and so we say it is cy frobenius of dimension @xmath10 .",
    "our methods give a very short , simple proof of the fact that the hochschild cohomology of such algebras is bv (  [ symfrobs ] ) , for which many ( generally more complicated ) proofs are given in e.g.  @xcite .    in @xcite",
    ", it was also noticed that the hochschild cohomology of preprojective algebras of dynkin quivers has a self - duality property : one has @xmath11 for such algebras , with @xmath12 , and moreover one has the periodicity @xmath13 when @xmath14 ( here , @xmath15 is an integer ) .",
    "we explain this by introducing _ stable hochschild cohomology _ @xmath16 , of frobenius algebras @xmath1 .",
    "this is a hochschild analogue of tate cohomology , which coincides with the usual hochschild cohomology in positive degrees , and is defined using the stable module category by @xmath17 ( in the latter form , this was studied in various papers , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we show that this is a @xmath18-graded ring , and prove it is graded - commutative . to our knowledge , this is the first time @xmath19 has been studied in this way . we also define the notion _ stable hochschild homology _ @xmath20 , which coincides with the usual notion in positive degrees , and prove that @xmath20 is a graded module over @xmath16 using a natural _ contraction _ action , which generalizes contraction in the @xmath21-graded case .",
    "these results are in theorem [ asfhh ] .",
    "we then show that , in general , @xmath22 ( which makes the contraction operations _ graded self - adjoint _ ) , and that the @xmath3-frobenius property produces dualities @xmath23 . put together , we obtain a _ graded frobenius algebra structure _ on @xmath16 ( theorem [ cyfhhthm ] ) , explaining the aforementioned results of @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xmath24 , as modules over @xmath25 ; in the preprojective algebra cases , @xmath26 , which explains the aforementioned duality .    call a ( frobenius ) algebra _ periodic _ if it has a periodic @xmath1-bimodule resolution ( or , more generally , @xmath27 in the stable bimodule category , for some @xmath28 ) .",
    "we prove that _ the stable hochschild cohomology of periodic cy frobenius algebras has a bv structure _",
    "( theorem [ pcyfralg ] ) .",
    "more generally , for any periodic ( not necessarily cy ) frobenius algebra , the structure of calculus @xcite on the pair @xmath29 extends to the @xmath18-graded setting @xmath30 ( theorem [ perfhhthm ] ) .",
    "moreover , we show that , in the ( centrally extended ) preprojective cases , the bv structure and frobenius algebra structure are compatible : the bv differential is graded selfadjoint ",
    "we call such an algebra a _ bv frobenius algebra_.    additionally , all of the above work is done in the context not only of frobenius algebras over a field , but over an arbitrary base commutative ring .",
    "precisely , we use the notion of _ frobenius extensions of the first kind _",
    "@xcite , which says that the algebra is projective over a base commutative ring @xmath4 and that the duality is nondegenerate over this base .",
    "( perhaps this could be generalized further to an @xmath31-frobenius property , but we do not do this here . )    new computational results ( extending @xcite ) concerning preprojective algebras include :    * the computation of hochschild ( co)homology of preprojective algebras of dynkin type over @xmath32 ( in types @xmath33 , the results @xcite are over characteristic - zero fields ) , and the proof that @xmath34 is _ bv frobenius _ over any field ( theorem [ prepthm ] ) ; * the computation of cup product and bv structure on hochschild ( co)homology of _ centrally extended preprojective algebras _",
    "@xcite ( the groups were computed over @xmath0 in @xcite ) , which we show is _ bv frobenius _ ( theorem [ cprepthm ] ) ; * the computation of the induced maps from the hochschild ( co)homology in the * extended * dynkin case to the dynkin case by cutting off the extending vertex ( theorem [ eddcompthm ] ) .",
    "this explains the structure in the dynkin case and elucidates the relationship between the usual calabi - yau and calabi - yau frobenius properties ( which is analogous to euclidean vs. spherical geometry ) ;    we also explain and simplify the cited known results .",
    "our other main example is the case of group algebras of finite groups , which are automatically calabi - yau frobenius ( since they are symmetric ) .",
    "we are interested in when these are periodic ( and hence @xmath34 is bv and frobenius , by theorem [ pcyfralg ] ) .",
    "we show ( theorem [ gpalgthm ] ) that the periodic ( cy ) frobenius algebras are just the classical periodic algebras , i.e. , those whose group cohomology is periodic ( using classical results ) . in the appendix",
    ", we also give an elementary topological proof that groups that act freely and simplicially on a sphere ( such as finite subgroups of @xmath35 ) are periodic ( cy ) frobenius .",

    "the second author was partially supported by an nsf grf .",

    "( for an explanation , see proposition [ projprop ] , where we give a refined version . )    hence , in order for the hochschild cohomology to be periodic , it must be that the numbers of generators of the cohomology groups of @xmath42 are bounded .",
    "let us now set @xmath1001 .",
    "then , the classical suzuki - zassenhaus theorem classifies all such groups .",
    "these groups are those such that all abelian subgroups are cyclic , and they fall into six explicit families ( cf .",
    "p.  150 of @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , these all have periodic group cohomology . since this property is preserved under taking subgroups , we deduce the ( probably well known )    the group algebra @xmath1002 $ ] of a finite group @xmath42 has periodic hochschild cohomology iff all abelian subgroups of @xmath42 are cyclic . for such groups , @xmath41 $ ]",

    "fortunately , there is a very similar classical result of swan ( which also used the ( mod-@xmath294 ) classification of periodic groups ) :    @xcite let @xmath1004 $ ] for some set @xmath1005 of primes .",

    "note that a sequence of ( projective ) @xmath79-bimodules which are split as left @xmath79-modules can have the @xmath79-bimodule action twisted to @xmath1013 to make them split as right @xmath79-modules rather than as left @xmath79-modules .",

    "we note that this corollary may also be deduced from the version of the theorem proved in the appendix , where @xmath42 acts cellularly .",
    "to do this , we form a cw decomposition of @xmath1034 by geodesic codimension - one slices , fixed under the orbit of @xmath42 , which separate a given point @xmath1035 from all of its orbits under @xmath42 .",
    "in this section , we provide an elementary proof of theorem [ fingpthm ] in the case that @xmath42 acts cellularly on a finite cw complex homeomorphic to @xmath1030 .",
    "our proof avoids the use of the classification of periodic groups , and is purely topological .",
