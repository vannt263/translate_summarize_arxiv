    "most communication networks seen in every day life suffer congestion problems at times of peak traffic .",
    "telephone networks , traffic networks and computer networks all experience serious delays in the transfer of information due to congestion or jamming@xcite .",
    "network congestion occurs when too many hosts simultaneously try to send too much data through a network .",
    "various factors such as capacity , band - width and network topology play an important role in contributing to traffic congestion .",
    "the identification of optimal structures that minimise congestion as well as the identification of processes that give rise to such structures have been considered in recent studies@xcite .",
    "however , there have not been many attempts to improve the performance of communication networks by making small modifications to existing networks .",
    "it has been established that the manipulation of node - capacity and network capacity can effect drastic improvement in the performance and efficiency of load - bearing networks @xcite .",
    "protocols which can efficiently manipulate these factors to relieve congestion at high traffic densities in communication networks can be of practical importance . in this paper , we discuss efficient methods by which traffic congestion can be reduced in a two dimensional communication network of hubs and nodes by minimal manipulation of its hub capacities and connections @xcite .",
    "we set up a coefficient of betweenness centrality ( cbc ) , which is a direct measure of message traffic @xcite , and conclude that the addition of assortative connections to the hubs of the highest cbc is the most effective way to relieve congestion problems .     a 2-d lattice with regular nodes with @xmath0 edges connected to all nearest neighbours ( as explicitly shown for node @xmath1 ) and hubs ( filled circles ) connected to all constituent nodes within their influence area ( see the hub @xmath2 )",
    ". two way assortative connections of two types are shown i ) with dotted lines between any two of the top five hubs ( labelled @xmath3 ) , ii ) with solid lines when the other end point is selected randomly from the rest of the hubs . ]",
    "we study traffic congestion for a model network with local clustering@xcite .",
    "this network consists of a two - dimensional lattice with two types of nodes , ordinary nodes and hubs ( see fig .",
    "each ordinary node is connected to its nearest - neighbours , whereas the hubs are connected to all nodes within a given area of influence defined as a square of side @xmath4 centered around the hub@xcite .",
    "the hubs are randomly distributed on the lattice such that no two hubs are separated by less than a minimum distance , @xmath5 .",
    "constituent nodes in the overlap areas of hubs acquire connections to all the hubs whose influence areas overlap .",
    "the degree distribution of this network is bi - modal in nature .",
    "there are several studies which examine traffic on two - dimensional regular lattices@xcite as well as on two - dimensional regular lattices with nodes of two types , which are designated as hosts and routers @xcite .",
    "it has been established that despite the regular geometry , traffic on such networks reproduces the characteristics of realistic internet traffic .",
    "we simulate message traffic on this system .",
    "any node can function as a source or target node for a message and can also be a temporary message holder or router .",
    "the metric distance between any pair of source ( @xmath6 ) and target ( @xmath7 ) nodes on the network is defined to be the manhattan distance @xmath8 .",
    "the traffic flow on the network is implemented using the following routing algorithm .    since the shortest paths between source and target pairs on the lattice go through hubs messages are routed through hubs .",
    "the current message holder @xmath9 tries to send the message towards a temporary target @xmath10 , which is the hub nearest @xmath9 which is closer to the target than @xmath9 .",
    "if @xmath9 is an ordinary node , it send sends the message to its to its nearest neighbour towards @xmath10 , or if @xmath9 is a hub , it forwards the message to that of its constituent nodes nearest to the final target .",
    "if the would - be recipient node is occupied , then the message waits for a unit time step at @xmath9 .",
    "if the desired node is still occupied after the waiting time is over , @xmath9 selects any unoccupied node of its remaining neighbours and hands over the message .    in case",
    "all the remaining neighbours are occupied , the message waits at @xmath9 until one of them is free .",
    "when a constituent node of @xmath10 , receives the message , it sends the message directly to the hub .",
    "if @xmath10 is occupied , then the message waits at the constituent node until the hub is free . when the message reaches the temporary target @xmath10 it sends the message to a peripheral node in the direction of the target , which then chooses a new hub as the new temporary target and sends a message in its direction",
    "although the hubs provide short paths on the lattice , hubs which have many paths running through them also function as trapping sites for messages due to their finite capacity .",
    "such hubs can be identified using a quantity , the co - efficient of betweenness centrality ( cbc ) , which is a direct measure of network traffic and defined as the ratio of the number of messages @xmath11 which pass through a given hub @xmath12 to the total number of messages which run simultaneously , i.e. @xmath13 .",
    "we plot the distribution of the fraction of hubs with a given value of @xmath14 against @xmath14 in fig .",
    "[ fewhubs ] .",
    "it is clear that hubs with low values of @xmath14 dominate the distribution , and the number of hubs with high values of @xmath14 is very small .",
    "these hubs tend to be potential locations of congestion .",
    "additionally , the behaviour of many communication networks in real life also indicates that a few hubs may be responsible for the worst cases of congestion , and the significant addition of capacity at these hubs alone may go a long way towards relieving network congestion . in order to test this idea , we operate our network in a regime where congestion is likely to occur .",
    "this figure plots the fraction of hubs with a given value of @xmath14 versus @xmath14 values for @xmath15 and @xmath16 . ]",
    "we compare the performance of the enhancement methods outlined above for a network of ( @xmath17 ) nodes with overlap parameter @xmath18 for hub densities upto @xmath19 . the total number of messages @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the length of the run is fixed at @xmath22 .",
    "the average fraction of messages which reach their destination and the average travel time of the messages which reach are measures of the efficiency of the network and are calculated over @xmath23 configurations .",
    "we test the baseline network , where each hub has unit capacity and can only hold a maximum of one message at a given time , for its efficiency in terms of the number of messages delivered as a function of the hub density .",
    "table i lists the fraction of messages which reach their target as a function of hub density .",
    "the hub density is listed in column one of the table and the fraction of messages which reach the target for the baseline in column two .",
    "it is clear that at low hub densities barely @xmath24 percent of the messages reach the target .    to check whether the augmentation of capacity at the hubs of high betweenness centrality relieves the congestion ,",
    "we augment the capacity of the top five hubs ranked by their cbc by a factor of five ( each of the top five hubs can now hold five messages at a time ) .",
    "column three shows the fraction of messages which reach the target for this enhanced case .",
    "unfortunately , the comparison of the second and third columns indicates that the capacity enhancement enhances the fraction of messages delivered only marginally .",
    "thus the enhancement of capacity alone does not relieve congestion very significantly .    .",
    "this table shows @xmath25 the fraction of messages delivered during a run as a function of the hub density @xmath26 .",
    "the second column shows @xmath25 for the baseline viz . the lattice with hubs of unit capacity and",
    "the remaining columns show the fraction of messages delivered for the case with enhanced capacity @xmath14 , and the case of enhanced capacity with assortative connections between the top five hubs ( @xmath27 ) and between the top five hubs and randomly chosen other hubs ( @xmath28 ) . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     earlier studies on branching hierarchical networks indicate that the manipulation of capacity and connectivity together can lead to major improvements in the performance and efficiency of the network @xcite .",
    "in addition , studies of the present network @xcite indicate that the introduction of a small number of assortative connection per hub has a drastic effect on the travel times of messages .",
    "it is therefore interesting to investigate whether introducing connections between hubs of high @xmath14 has any effect on relieving congestion .",
    "we therefore add two way connections between the top five hubs with enhanced capacities as above ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "the fraction of messages delivered is listed in the fourth column of table i. it is clear that there is a dramatic enhancement in the number of messages delivered going from @xmath30 to @xmath31 at low hub densities .",
    "setting up two - way connections between the top @xmath32 hubs and randomly chosen other hubs ( @xmath33 ) increased the number of messages which were successfully delivered to @xmath34 ( see the fifth column of the table ) .",
    "thus the addition of assortative connections to a few hubs of high capacity relieves congestion very efficiently .",
    "plot of @xmath35 , the number of messages running on the lattice as a function of @xmath36 at ( a ) low hub density ( 50 hubs ) , ( b ) high hub density ( 400 hubs ) .",
    "the curve labelled ` 1 ' shows the behaviour on the lattice with assortative connections , the curve labelled ` 2 ' shows that of the lattice with enhanced capacity ( @xmath37 ) and that labelled ` 3 ' shows the behaviour of the base - line . ]    the quantity @xmath35 , the total number of messages running in the system at a given time @xmath36 , is also a useful quantifier of the efficiency of the system in delivering messages , as the number of messages decreases as they are delivered to the desired target .",
    "we plot this quantity in fig .",
    "[ navg](a ) ( low hub densities ) and fig .",
    "[ navg](b ) ( high hub densities ) for the four cases defined above .",
    "it is clear that the addition of two - way connections from the top five hubs ( after capacity augmentation ) to randomly chosen hubs from the remaining hubs relieves the congestion extremely rapidly in comparison to the base - line at both low and high hub densities .",
    "another interesting quantity in this context is the queue length at a given hub as a function of time .",
    "a hub is said to have a queue of @xmath38 messages if at a given time @xmath36 all @xmath38 messages have chosen this hub as their temporary target during their journeys towards their respective final targets .",
    "[ qlength ] shows the queue lengths as functions of time for one of the top five hubs for the base - line , cbc and the two cases of cbc with assortative connections .",
    "it is very clear that the assortative connections clear the queues very fast at each of the hubs by diverting messages along other paths .",
    "the queue lengths at several of the hubs show a peak before they start falling off , indicating that the messages start taking alternate paths only after the congestion along the shortest paths builds up .",
    "the behaviour of queue lengths at the hub with the highest @xmath14 as a function of time .",
    "the hub density was fixed at @xmath39 . ]",
    "we next look at the statistics of average waiting times . according to our routing rules",
    ", a message waits at the constituent node of a hub if the delivery of the the message to the hub will exceed the capacity of the hub .",
    "thus the average waiting time , viz .",
    "the amount of time , on average , that a message spends waiting at all the constituent nodes it encounters during its entire journey , is an important characteriser of transmission efficiency .",
    "we study the waiting time as a function of @xmath40 for the different strategies .",
    "we also include the waiting time of messages which do not succeed in reaching the target in this average .",
    "when most messages get through , this quantity has a small value ( as at low values of @xmath40 in fig .",
    "[ figphase1 ] ) but it increases in a nonlinear fashion with increasing distance . the decrease in waiting times of the @xmath14 and @xmath14 with assortative connections when compared with the base - line is clear from the figure .",
    "plot of average waiting time per message as a function of @xmath40 for @xmath41 .",
    "the hub density was fixed at @xmath39 . ]",
    "we thus see that the addition of assortative connections to hubs of high betweenness centrality is an extremely efficient way of relieving traffic congestion in a communication network .",
    "while the augmentation of capacity at such hubs can reduce congestion marginally , the data indicates that a large augmentation of capacity would be required to achieve effective decongestion .",
    "thus the cost of achieving decongestion by capacity augmentation alone would be quite high .",
    "on the other hand , efficient decongestion can be achieved by the addition of extra connections to a very small number of hubs of high betweenness centrality .",
    "decongestion is achieved most rapidly when two - way connections are added from the hubs of high betweenness centrality to other randomly chosen hubs . however , other ways of adding assortative connections such as one way connections , or one - way and two way connections between the hubs of high cbc also work reasonably well .",
    "we note that this method is a low cost method as very few extra connections are added to as few as five hubs .",
    "the methods used here are general and can be carried over to other types of networks as well .",
    "thus , our methods could find useful applications in realistic situations .",
    "our network with assortative connections is an example of an engineered network",
    ". it would be interesting to see whether networks can develop such assortative connections by self - organisation mechanisms .",
