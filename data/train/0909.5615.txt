    "<S> thus , in the present case , the quark field that defines @xmath76 is thought to be expanded in the same form as eq.([field ] ) but with @xmath77 with the bogoliubov amplitudes specified below . </S>",
    "<S> substituting it to eq.([propagator ] ) and fourier transformation lead to @xmath78    next , the densities such as @xmath79 are expressed in terms of the bogoliubov amplitudes by specifying the relevant transformation . </S>",
    "<S> in general , the exchange of quantum mesonic field produces non - local interactions of the type @xmath80@xmath80 , @xmath81@xmath81 , @xmath80@xmath81 , @xmath80@xmath82 , @xmath81@xmath83 , and @xmath80@xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) . </S>",

    "<S> figure  [ fig2 ]  ( b ) shows the bogoliubov amplitudes @xmath120 and @xmath121 . aside from the bump around @xmath127 mentioned below , the hole character changes gradually to the particle character around the fermi surface as the usual cooper pairing . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to the peak in the pair wave function @xmath128 ( see eq.([pwf ] ) ) shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ]  ( c ) . </S>",
    "<S> the bump around @xmath127 is a novel feature of the present case ; this is brought about by the mesonic contribution @xmath52 to the gap function @xmath122 ( see eq.([bf ] ) ) as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ]  ( d ) . in this gap function , </S>",
    "<S> the mesonic and the cooper pair components are comparable around the fermi surface , whereas the former is dominant around @xmath127 because of the @xmath90 dependence @xmath129 .    </S>",

    "<S> figure  [ fig3 ]  ( a ) shows the pair wave functions at several @xmath0s as functions of the momentum . </S>",

    "<S> thus , we can conclude that the pionic condensation has a mixed character : purely bosonic just after the appearance of the condensation , then the cooper pairing gradually grows as @xmath1 increases with retaining significant bosonic component . to look into the spatial structure of cooper </S>",

    "<S> the picture of a gas of bound mesons may apply to @xmath139 while that of a liquid ( see also ref .  </S>",
