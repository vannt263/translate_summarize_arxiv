    "in recent years , with the prospect of the increase in the sensitivity and angular resolution of the forthcoming cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) satellite and interferometry experiments  @xcite , efforts have been driven to the theoretical study of the secondary anisotropies contributions to the temperature fluctuations on arcminute scales and below . while the primordial anisotropies from recombination are thought to be well understood secondary anisotropies from reionization are not .",
    "as is well known , the current favored inflationary model of structure formation predicts a nearly gaussian probability distribution for the primordial density fluctuations . in this case , the cmb is completely described by its two - point correlation function or power spectrum in fourier space .",
    "all higher - order correlations can be expressed in terms of it .",
    "primordial nonlinearities and secondary effects introduce deviations from gaussianity , producing a detectable signal in both the power spectrum and higher - order statistics .",
    "recent work provides the theoretical background for the calculation of estimators of these higher - order statistics  @xcite and constrains possible non - gaussian primordial contributions to the bispectrum and the trispectrum on degree and sub - degree angular scales using actual data  @xcite .",
    "the interest is now in forecasting the expected signals on smaller scales due to secondary anisotropies , checking whether they are detectable and understanding how they can be separated from each other and from the primary anisotropies in light of the future data .",
    "the ostriker and vishniac ( ov ) effect  @xcite was found to be the dominant linear secondary contribution to the cmb anisotropies below the silk - damping scales at the arcminute level  @xcite .",
    "it is caused by thomson scattering off of the cmb photons by moving electrons during the initial phase of reionization .",
    "it has the advantage of taking place during the linear regime of structure evolution and of being a small - angle effect enabling one to obtain analytical expressions for its higher - order correlation functions in the small - angle limit . because of the highly predictive power of linear theory , any measurement of such statistics would be a sensitive probe of the reionization history of the universe , difficult to disentangle in measurements from nonlinear contributions .",
    "several derivations for its power spectrum have been carried out  @xcite but no one has fully addressed the calculation of its bispectrum or trispectrum .",
    "it is then timely to obtain these expressions and to qualify and quantify them .",
    "we therefore extend and detail previous techniques used for the calculation of the ov power spectrum to the calculation of its higher - order statistics .",
    "as it will be shown , for the particular case of fields which are vector - like in nature , such as the ov effect , even moments will dominate over odd moments , making the trispectrum a much more sensitive statistics than the bispectrum .",
    "given the low redshifts of formation of structure , it is interesting to consider whether nonlinear effects can further enhance these statistics .",
    "so we will extend our study to the weakly nonlinear regime , allowing us to probe the most natural extension of the ov effect to nonlinear scales , the so - called kinetic sunyaev - zeldovich ( ksz ) effect . on small scales , both arise from the density modulation of the doppler effect from large - scale bulk flows .",

    "measurements of the cmb anisotropies on sub - degree scales  @xcite have been used to put an upper bound on the reionization redsfhit of @xmath53  @xcite . very recently , using polarization and temperature anisotropies of the cmb , wmap has placed a fairly model - independent constrain  @xcite on the optical depth to electron scattering of @xmath54 at @xmath55% cl which translates into @xmath56 for instant reionization  @xcite .",

    "numerical studies ( see references below ) have been done to try to quantitatively understand many of the effects originated by reionization on the cmb , accuracy is difficult to reach and uncertainties still remain .",

    "enlightening comparative studies between different effects can also be found  @xcite .",
    "as ionization effects introduce non - gaussianities in the anisotropies , further studies were done on the calculation of their possible contributions to the bispectrum .",
    "many authors  @xcite investigated contributions to mixed bispectra due to couplings between lensing effects , integrated sachs - wolfe effect , thermal sz and doppler effects , such as the ov effect .",
    "the trispectrum of ionization secondaries  @xcite hasnt been explored very much .",
    "no one has addressed the calculation of the pure bispectrum and trispectrum of the ov effect until now .    in the linear regime , for the power spectrum , the dominant small - angular scale contribution from reionization was found to be the ov effect  @xcite .",
    "it arises from the second order modulation of the doppler effect by density fluctuations which affect the probability of scattering .",
    "because of its density weighting , it peaks at small angular scales , typically arcminute scales in @xmath0cdm models , and should produce @xmath61 anisotropies .",
    "its contributions to the temperature fluctuations along the line of sight can be written in the manner of jaffe and kamionkowski ( jk )  @xcite @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 is the visibility function given by @xmath65 which gives the probability of scattering .",
    "the prefactor @xmath66 is obtained assuming that all the baryons are in the form of protons ( if we use the fact that the mass fraction of helium is @xmath67% then one should multiply it by @xmath68 ) .",
    "the visibility function is normalized such that @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the optical depth to the surface of last scattering at recombination .",

    "we assume that the visibility function is approximated as a gaussian in conformal time @xmath79    following jk  @xcite , we choose a coordinate system such that @xmath80 represents a three - dimensional unit vector along the line of sight and @xmath81 refers to a two - dimensional unit vector in the plane perpendicular to the line of sight .",
    "so we will have @xmath82 and @xmath83 where this approximation arises from the small - scale nature of the effect .",
    "bold letters represent three - dimensional vectors .",
    "the ov is a small - angle effect so we can work under the flat - sky approximation and expand the temperature perturbations in fourier space @xmath84 where @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 is the fourier transform of @xmath88 ( see jk  @xcite ) . @xmath89 and @xmath90 depend on @xmath48 .",
    "we made use of the continuity equation in fourier space ( [ eq : veckeqn ] ) and of the linear evolution of the density field .",
    "the statistical properties of a field can be characterized by the n - point correlation functions in real space or by the n - point spectra in fourier space .",
    "if the field is gaussian in nature , like the primordial density fluctuations field in the current favored inflationary cosmology , the connected part of the n - point functions disappears for @xmath91 .",
    "the non - zero ( even - n)-point correlation functions can be expressed with the 2-point correlation function . as a result",
    ", a gaussian distribution is completely described by the two - point correlation function , or power spectrum , and any non - gaussian field will be detectable by measuring the connected part of its n - point correlation function .",
    "if we consider a general statistically homogeneous and isotropic 2-dimensional field @xmath92 with zero mean , its power spectrum @xmath93 , bispectrum @xmath94 and trispectrum @xmath95 are defined by the following equations in the appropriate fourier convention : @xmath96 where the subscript @xmath97 stands for connected . the ov effect being a secondary effect",
    "will introduce non - gaussianities in the original primordial gaussian distributed temperature fluctuations . as a consequence ,",
    "contributions to its bispectrum and trispectrum are expected .",
    "combining the homogeneous theory of turbulence with the limber approximation enables one to infer the dominant contribution among n - point statistics of an isotropic and homogeneous vector - like field effect whose statistical properties vary slowly in time",
    ". in particular , we can apply this to the ov effect . in short ,",
    "the theory of homogeneous turbulence shows how to build invariant spectral tensors of arbitrary order , corresponding to expectation values of arbitrary products of statistically homogeneous vector fields .",
    "it is based on techniques proposed in the area of homogeneous turbulence in the 1940s by robertson  @xcite .",
    "relying on this theory , all expectation values of an odd product of an isotropic @xmath98-dimensional vector field @xmath99 with @xmath85 must be proportional to at least one of the @xmath100 vectors , contrary to the expectation values of even products .",
    "because of the limber approximation , extended to higher - statistics in appendix a , which states that the only contributions to the projected correlation function on the sky come from the fourier modes perpendicular to the line of sight of the angular correlation function , all the @xmath101 terms tend to be suppressed",
    ". there will be different levels of suppression depending on the order of the @xmath101 dependence of our statistics .",
    "combining these two results , we can conclude that even correlation functions of the ov effect dominate over odd correlation functions making the trispectrum a much more sensitive statistics than the bispectrum .",
    "also , we expect the correlation functions to obey the homogeneous and isotropy theory fully and thus to be the result of contributions of different orders in the @xmath101 terms .",
    "we have developed a method which permits to calculate the dominant contribution , under the limber approximation .",
    "this is a characteristic of all effects physically described by an isotropic vector field and can thus be useful for other studies .",
    "as noted previously by scannapieco  @xcite , the alternation of dominant / subdominant / dominant higher order correlation functions provides a unique signal distinguishing the ov effect from other non - vector like secondary anisotropies and consequently can enable one to disentangle it from other contributions at similar angular scales .",
    "a fundamental issue is to know how well we can separate the ov signal , which is non - gaussian , from the gaussian signal , noise and foregrounds which are always present in a measurement from an experiment .",
    "a way of quantifying this detection is to calculate the @xmath102 statistics ( as in  @xcite ) .",
    "to do so , one needs to calculate the fisher information matrix @xmath103 ( for a good review see  @xcite ) .",
    "if we think of the data @xmath104 as a random variable with a likelihood function @xmath105 where @xmath106 is a vector of model parameters , the fisher information matrix is defined as @xmath107 by a very powerful theorem , called the cramer - rao inequality , it was shown  @xcite that the variance of any unbiased estimator of a certain parameter in a model , can not be less than @xmath108 . as the signal calculated is expected to be rather small , we are interested in estimating its overall detectability as in  @xcite . therefore , we assume that the form of our model @xmath109 ( in our case the bispectrum and the trispectrum ) is correct and that the only interesting parameter is its amplitude @xmath110 , where the true value of @xmath111 .",
    "then the cramer - rao inequality tells us that the variance of the measurement of @xmath110 is no less than @xmath112 and we define the @xmath102 statistics as @xmath113 the calculation of the fisher matrix @xmath114 of the statistics of the ov effect involves the calculation of the contribution of the noise to the power spectrum @xmath115 , as it will be shown .",
    "the noise depends on the experiment characteristics .",
    "we consider a hypothetical experiment which maps a fraction of the sky @xmath116 with a gaussian beam with full width at half maximum @xmath117 and pixel noise @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is the detector sensitivity and @xmath120 is the time spent observing each pixel .",
    "we use the inverse weight per solid angle , @xmath121 , in order to have a measure which is independent of the pixel - size  @xcite .",
    "@xmath122 is the cmb thermodynamic temperature .",
    "if only a fraction @xmath116 of the sky is mapped , treating the pixel noise as gaussian and ignoring any correlations between pixels a good estimate of the @xmath115  @xcite is @xmath123 where @xmath124 , in radians , is the width of the beam if we assume it has a gaussian profile .",
    "it is related to @xmath117 , in arcminutes , by @xmath125 .",
    "note that if an experiment maps the full sky and then a fraction @xmath126 is subtracted , one should not multiply @xmath127 by @xmath116 ( case of map and planck ) . hence we can estimate @xmath115 for any experiment with characteristic @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "for the precise cases of map ( renamed wmap recently ) and planck , for which we used the specifications in table  [ table1 ] , we need to take into account their multi - frequency coverage with different characteristics .",
    "the @xmath115 is then defined as  @xcite @xmath128 where the sum runs over all channels of the experiment and @xmath129 is the frequency of the channel .    .",

    "many authors have derived the expression for this statistics @xcite .",
    "we use the jk formalism but a different technique which will be useful in what follows .",
    "as we see , this expression involves a double integration in time , angle and wavenumber , being numerically long to evaluate .",
    "it is useful to note that as the statistical properties of the field @xmath133 vary slowly in time and as the ov effect is a small - angle effect we can employ the limber approximation ( see a1 ) to considerably simplify our derivations .",
    "we stress here that we are allowed to use this approximation as the ov effect takes place at sufficiently high @xmath134 , where the difference between the approximation and the integral is very small .    as the two permutations @xmath135 are symmetric due to statistical homogeneity",

    "we can also infer that the dominant contribution has to come from the @xmath158 term as it has no explicit dependency on @xmath101 . as we know , in the limber approximation , fourier modes parallel to the line of sight ( terms on @xmath101 ) tend to be suppressed .",

    "thirdly , when calculating the covariance matrix of the fisher matrix , two simplifying assumptions were used : that the main contribution to the covariance was gaussian in nature and that we observed with full - sky coverage . finally , other physical mechanisms , like for example lensing effects or the thermal sz effect  @xcite , and unaccounted foregrounds  @xcite can contribute to the trispectrum at this level and so the separability problem needs to be addressed in due time",
    "of course , uncertainties of roughly an order of magnitude in the modeling of the thermal sz signal are also a source of error in our estimates",
    ". the forecasted ability of future multi - frequency experiments to remove most of the thermal sz contributions would minimize these uncertainties and would much favor a detection .",
    "last but not least , further progress in the implementation of optimal unbiased trispectrum estimators to probe such small scales and power is required .    to 0.30    = 3.5truein",
    "due to its strong predictive power , linear theory is a very sensitive probe of the early stages of the reionization history through the ostriker and vishniac effect .",
    "analytical expressions for its correlation functions can be derived and their measurement would be of high value to our present knowledge of that still unclear epoch of the universe evolution .",
    "we have presented detailed calculations of the three fourier statistics of interest of the ov effect , the power spectrum , the bispectrum and the trispectrum . for that purpose",
    "we have developed a new technique that allows one to obtain their dominant contributions under the limber approximation framework .",
    "this method is applicable to the derivation of any statistics involving correlations among vector - like effects .",
    "it illustrates what was expected under statistical homogeneity and isotropy assumptions and the vector and small scale nature of the ov effect .",
    "we also evaluated numerically , as a function of scale and for a specific configuration ( equilateral for the bispectrum and trapezoidal for the trispectrum ) , these statistics for a flat @xmath0cdm cosmology and two reionization scenarios .",
    "the first one is based on our pre - wmap knowledge ( @xmath46 ) and the second one takes into account the high values for the electron optical depth measured by wmap ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "we numerically obtained approximate scaling relations for the amplitude of the ov statistics on the reionization history considered and found that the dependence is stronger on the ionization fraction than on the redshift of reionization .",
    "we have also studied their detectability in view of future satellite experiments .",
    "the alternation of dominant / subdominant / dominant higher order correlation functions was numerically shown .",
    "while the bispectrum is undetectable even by a perfect multi - frequency experiment capable of subtracting the thermal sz contributions , the trispectrum could be measured by planck or by interferometer experiments targeting arcminute scales with high sensitivity and for a sufficiently long period of time .",
    "this provides a unique signal distinguishing the ov effect from other non vector - like secondary anisotropies and could be useful when trying to separate different physical mechanisms imprinting themselves on these measurable statistics .",
    "one should bear in mind that despite this useful characteristic signature , our results are quite optimistic , although encouraging , as they rely on various analytically helpful idealized assumptions , as described previously .",
    "also , other contributions to the signal are to be expected at the arcminute level and thus further study of cmb small - scale secondary anisotropies and foregrounds contributions to the trispectrum is required and much justified . in order to obtain an upper limit on the possible ksz contributions , we also extended our calculations to the mildly nonlinear regime .",
    "we found that , contrary to the bispectrum , there is a noticeable enhancement of the contributions of the trispectrum in a morphological dependent way and that this enhancement reflects itself on the calculations of the signal - to - noise .",
    "hence nonlinearities are expected to enhance the even non - gaussian signals produced by the ov effect and further complicate its disentanglement from inevitable model - dependent nonlinear effects arising from structure formation .",
    "conversely , having a template of the ov effect can help in extracting the nonlinear contributions to reionization at those angular scales , providing another possible window on the complex physics associated with reionization .",
    "i am much indebted to pedro g. ferreira whose suggestions , comments and constant support have been invaluable during the preparation of this work .",
    "i thank also asantha cooray for very helpful discussions and comments and for the thermal sz data used to facilitate direct comparison with his results , evan scannapieco for helping to improve the manuscript and to correct a fundamental error in the calculations , nabila aghanim for her support and the thermal sz data used throughout the article , andrew jaffe for his comments and martin kunz for his encouragement .",

    "we review the fundamental steps of the limber approximation as used in the text . the limber eq .",
    "@xcite describes the two - point statistics of a field which is the two - dimensional projection on the sky of a three - dimensional field whose statistical properties vary slowly along the line of sight .",
    "the fourier space analog of this result was calculated by kaiser  @xcite .",
    "later it was further extended from the flat - sky approximation to an all - sky approach for spatially flat cosmologies by hu and white  @xcite and to open cosmologies by hu @xcite .",
    "@xcite derived the fourier space analog of the limber s equation for the bispectrum .",
    "here we review the bispectrum derivation of buchalter _ et .",
    "al . _ and generalize it to the trispectrum .",
    "this applies as well to higher - order statistics .",
    "the error introduced by the limber approximation is inferior to @xmath349 for effects with @xmath350  @xcite .",
    "suppose we observe the projection along the line of sight of a three - dimensional statistically homogeneous and isotropic random field @xmath228 @xmath351 where @xmath82 and @xmath352 .",
    "we propose ourselves to find a relation between the spatial bispectrum @xmath353 of @xmath354 and the spatial bispectrum @xmath355 of @xmath228 .",
    "following kaiser method , we consider @xmath354 to be the sum of the contributions from narrow shells with a width @xmath356 much bigger than the relevant wavelength , that is @xmath357 .",
    "this choice allows us to look at fluctuations on scales much less than the characteristic scale over which @xmath358 varies and to assume that contributions from different shells are statistically independent .",
    "we then calculate the contributions to the bispectrum from each of the shells . at the end",
    "we can sum the power for all the shells relying on their statistical independence .    assuming that @xmath358 varies very little along the shell and that the section of the shell is plane - symmetric the contribution from the shell of width @xmath356 centered at @xmath359 is @xmath360 decomposing the fields in fourier space , the spectrum of @xmath361 is @xmath362 where @xmath363 and @xmath364 .",
    "we can perform the @xmath365 integral which is @xmath366 and the time integral which is @xmath367 to yield @xmath368 using @xmath369 the three - point spectrum is @xmath370 the important simplification comes from the fact that the major contribution from the first two bessel functions comes from @xmath371 and @xmath372 .",
    "but by assumption @xmath373 , @xmath374 and @xmath375 . therefore , @xmath376 , @xmath377 and @xmath378 .",
    "so we can neglect all fourier modes parallel to the line of sight . to a very good approximation @xmath379 .",
    "the integration of the bessel functions gives @xmath380we obtain finally @xmath381summing over the shells , and using @xmath382 @xmath383 the exact same reasoning can be applied to the calculation of the trispectrum .",
    "this time we obtain for the same projection @xmath384    99 see the map homepage at http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov , and the planck homepage at http://astro.estec.esa.nl/sa-general/projects/cobras/cobras.html .",
