    "[ fig : model ] ( example a ) , whose projected counterparts @xmath73 and @xmath44 with the projection ( [ eqn : p1 ] ) of the structure @xmath74 generate @xmath75 .",
    "this single example makes us sure that it is the case for almost all systems .    to see this ,",
    "let us formalize in the following way .",
    "take @xmath76 of example a again .",
    "we extract the relevant sector specified by @xmath7 from each element of @xmath29 and call it @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) , which is a @xmath79 matrix with dimension @xmath80 and is a function @xmath81 of @xmath39 and @xmath41 . together with the @xmath79 identity matrix @xmath82 , the matrices @xmath83 form @xmath84 .",
    "this fact can be mathematically expressed as follows .",
    "we `` vectorize '' each matrix @xmath77 to a @xmath85-dimensional column vector @xmath86 by lining up the columns of the matrix @xmath77 from top to bottom , and gather the column vectors @xmath86 side by side to make up a @xmath87 matrix @xmath88 .",
    "then , the fact that the matrices @xmath83 span @xmath84 is expressed as @xmath89 . note that this determinant is also a function @xmath90 of @xmath39 and @xmath41 .    now take a generic couple of commuting hamiltonians @xmath91 and @xmath92 of @xmath42 qubits , i.e. , we randomly choose their eigenvalues @xmath93 , @xmath94 and a common unitary matrix @xmath95 which diagonalizes @xmath91 and @xmath92 simultaneously . inserting this couple of hamiltonians , the determinant @xmath96 is , by construction , a polynomial in the parameters @xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "we already know that this polynomial is non - vanishing for the parameter set @xmath99 corresponding to the above specific choice of the hamiltonians @xmath39 and @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , the determinant @xmath100 is a non - zero polynomial in the parameters @xmath97 , implying that its roots are of measure zero in the parameter space . in other words , for almost all parameters @xmath97 , the determinant @xmath100 is non - vanishing , and in turn , almost all couples of commuting hamiltonians become universal , generating @xmath101 , by the projection @xmath7 on the first qubit .",
    "this argument can be generalized to any rank @xmath102 projection , and also to any qubit amplitude damping channel in the strong - damping limit .",
    "the continuous projection @xmath43 required for the qubit - chain model depicted in fig .  [ fig : model ] can be induced by an amplitude damping channel acting on qubit 1 .",
    "in fact , consider the master equation @xmath103 with a single lindblad operator @xmath104 which describes the decay of qubit 1 from @xmath105 to @xmath35 , where @xmath35 is associated with the projection @xmath43 in ( [ eqn : p1 ] ) and @xmath105 is the state orthogonal to @xmath35 . solving the system dynamics under the master equation yields @xmath106 + e^{-\\gamma t/2}[p_1\\rho(0)q_1+q_1 \\rho(0 ) p_1]$ ] , where @xmath107 , and @xmath108 represents the partial trace over qubit 1 .",
    "thus , in the limit @xmath109 , we have @xmath110 , and qubit 1 is projected into the state @xmath35 with probability 1 . if this process takes place on a time scale @xmath111 much shorter than any other time scales involved in the dynamics or the controls , then it is effective in inducing a quantum zeno effect on qubit 1 , and it is essentially equivalent to repeating projective measurements .",

    "<S> what experimentalists typically do is to apply sequences of control pulses ( e.g. , by sequentially switching on and off different electromagnetic fields ) to steer quantum systems . in the quantum world , however , there is another option associated with the fact that the measurement process itself can induce a transformation on a quantum system . in this context </S>",
    "<S> an intriguing possibility is offered by the quantum zeno effect @xcite . it forces the system to evolve in a given subspace of the total hilbert space by performing frequent projective measurements ( zeno dynamics ) @xcite , without the need of monitoring their outcomes ( _ non - adaptive _ feedback strategy ) . </S>",
    "<S> several attempts have already been discussed to exploit such effects for quantum computation , see e.g. , @xcite . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we show that the constraint imposed via a zeno projection can in fact _ </S>",

    "<S> , the dynamics of the system is forced to evolve in a given subspace of the total hilbert space @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one might therefore think that the constrained dynamics is less `` rich '' than the original one . </S>",
    "<S> this naive expectation will turn out to be incorrect . </S>",
    "<S> these surprising aspects of constraints bear interesting similarities to einstein s precepts , according to which one can give a geometric description of complicated motion . the key geometrical idea </S>",
    "<S> is to embed the motion of the system of interest in a larger space , obtaining a forceless dynamics taking place along straight lines . </S>",
    "<S> the real dynamics , with interactions and potentials , is then obtained by projecting the system back onto the original space . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , the constrained dynamics is more _ complex _ than the higher - dimensional linear one . in classical mechanics these reduction procedures , linking a given dynamical system with the one constrained on a lower - dimensional manifold , have been extensively studied as an effective method for integrating the dynamics @xcite . in particular </S>",

    "<S> notable examples include the three - dimensional kepler problem , the calogero - moser model , toda systems , kdv and other integrable systems . </S>",
    "<S> the moral is that in classical mechanics , by constraining the dynamics , one often obtains an increase in complexity .    </S>",
    "<S> here we find a quantum version of this intriguing effect , which exploits the inherent non - commutative nature of quantum mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> the main idea is that even if two hamiltonians @xmath0 and @xmath1 are commutative , their projected counterparts can be non - commutative @xmath2=0 \\quad \\not\\rightarrow\\quad [ php , ph'p]=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is a projection . due to this fact </S>",
    "<S> we show that when passing from a set of control hamiltonians @xmath4 to their projected versions @xmath5 one can induce an enhancement in the complexity of the system dynamics which can be exponential , to the extent that it can be used to transform a small number of quantum gates which are not universal into a universal set capable of performing arbitrary quantum - computational tasks . </S>",
    "<S> we find that this effect is completely general and happens in almost all systems . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , we prove that any complex dynamics can be viewed as a simple dynamics in a larger dimension , with the original dynamics realized as a projected dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> what is interesting is that , in contrast to the classical case , the constraint which transforms a hamiltonian @xmath0 into @xmath6 can be imposed not by force but by a simple projective measurement whose outcomes need not be recorded ( the process being effectively equivalent to the one associated with an external noise that is monitoring the system ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the underlying mechanism can be rephrased as a modern version of plato s cave allegory @xcite . in the original version of the myth , </S>",
    "<S> the reality perceived within the cave is described by the projected shadows of some more fundamental dynamics which is intrinsically more complex . in the quantum world , however , the situation changes drastically and the _ projected _ reality perceived within plato s cave can be more complex than the one that has originated it .    . </S>",

    "<S> this contains , in embryo , the simple idea discussed in the introductory paragraph : interaction can arise from constraints ( in this case projections ) . to describe this mechanism it is worth reminding a few facts about the quantum control theory and the quantum zeno effect .    in a typical quantum control scenario </S>",
    "<S> it is assumed that the system of interest ( say the quantum register of a quantum computer , or the spins in an nmr experiment ) can be externally driven by means of sequences of unitary pulses @xmath10 , activated by turning on and off a set of given hamiltonians @xmath11 [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : zenodynamics](a ) ] @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if no limitations are imposed on the temporal durations @xmath12 of the pulses , it is known @xcite that by properly arranging sequences composed of @xmath13 one can in fact force the system to evolve under the action of arbitrary transformations of the form @xmath14 with the anti - hermitian operators @xmath15 being elements of the real lie algebra @xmath16 formed by the linear combinations of @xmath17 and their iterated commutators , @xmath18 $ ] , @xmath19\\bm{]}$ ] , etc . </S>",
    "<S> full controllability is hence achieved if the dimension of @xmath20 is large enough to permit the implementation of all possible unitary transformations on the system , i.e.  @xmath21 , with @xmath22 being the dimension of the system .    </S>",
    "<S> suppose now that between the applications of consecutive pulses @xmath23 we are allowed to perform von neumann s projective measurements [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : zenodynamics](b ) ] , aimed at checking whether or not the state of the system belongs to a given subspace @xmath8 of the global hilbert space . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we will assume that the system is originally initialized in @xmath8 while the various @xmath23 are infinitesimal transformations . </S>",
    "<S> under this condition , the zeno effect can be invoked , in the limit of infinitely frequent measurements , to ensure that with high probability the system will be always found in @xmath8 after each measurement , following a trajectory described by the effective hamiltonians @xmath24 , with @xmath7 the projection onto @xmath8 [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : zenodynamics](c ) ] @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , alternating the control pulses under the frequent applications of the projection @xmath7 the sequence @xmath25 can be effectively transformed into a rotation which on @xmath8 is defined by the unitary operator @xmath26 where @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly the real lie algebra @xmath28 now replaces @xmath20 in defining the space of unitary transformations which can be forced upon the system . </S>",
    "<S> the fundamental result of this paper is to observe that by properly choosing the system setting , the dimension of @xmath29 can be made larger than @xmath30 , to the extent that the former can be used to fully control the system on @xmath8 , in spite of the fact that the latter is not capable of doing the same .        </S>",
    "<S> to better elucidate the idea we find it useful to introduce a simple example , where the system is identified with a two - qubit system with control hamiltonians @xmath31 ( we hereafter use @xmath32 to denote pauli operators , and write tensor products as strings , with systems being specified with subscripts and omitting the identity operators ) . notice that their commutator vanishes @xmath33=0 $ ] , and hence the _ naked _ algebra @xmath20 of the two - qubit system has dimension only 2 . </S>",
    "<S> consider now the zeno algebra induced by the projection @xmath34 which freezes the first qubit in the state @xmath35 in the zeno limit . </S>",
    "<S> then , the effective zeno hamiltonians @xmath36 exhibit a non - trivial commutator @xmath37=2ip_{1}y_{2}/3 $ ] , which makes the dimension of @xmath29 equal to 3 ( the situation is schematically illustrated in fig .  [ fig : schematic - of - the ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this in particular implies that @xmath29 can now be used to fully control the system in the subspace @xmath38 ( which is isomorphic to the hilbert space of qubit 2 ) , a task that could not be fulfilled with the original @xmath30 .    </S>",
    "<S> [ [ zeno - yields - full - control . ] ] zeno yields full control. + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the example presented in the previous paragraph clarifies that the constrained dynamics can be more complex than the original unconstrained one . the natural question arises : how big can such a difference become ? to what extent can the presence of a measurement process increase the complexity of dynamics in quantum mechanics ? in the following </S>",
    "<S> we provide a couple of examples in which the enhancement in complexity is exponential . while the unprojected dynamics are only two or three dimensional , the projected ones are _ </S>",
    "<S> univeral for quantum computation_. this shows that the simple ingredient of projective measurement can strongly influence the complexity of dynamics .    </S>",

    "<S> the zeno projection @xmath43 on qubit 1 transforms the upper hamiltonians to the lower model , where the state of qubit 1 is frozen , while we are left with a heisenberg chain with the local term @xmath40 and a control @xmath44 on qubit 2 . </S>",

    "<S> now let us consider their constrained versions using the same projection @xmath49 as in ( [ eqn : p1 ] ) . with this choice </S>",
    "<S> we have @xmath50 , and the zeno hamiltonian associated to @xmath51 is given by @xmath52 where now @xmath53 is the nearest - neighbor heisenberg hamiltonian acting on qubits @xmath54 . while qubit 1 is kept frozen in the state @xmath55 by the repetitive projections @xmath43 , the remaining @xmath56 qubits now form a heisenberg chain with a local term on qubit 3 ( fig .  [ fig : model ] , lower ) . </S>",
    "<S> elementary but cumbersome calculation shows that with these zeno hamiltonians qubit 2 is fully controllable , which by ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite implies that the whole system apart from the frozen qubit 1 is fully controllable . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , we have @xmath57 , so that the zeno algebra is of exponential size , as claimed .    </S>",
    "<S> example b : an alternative example which do not involve three - body interactions is available . </S>",
    "<S> consider , for instance , three hamiltonians @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 , and take the zeno projection to be @xmath61 with @xmath43 and @xmath62 projecting qubits 1 and 3 respectively into the states @xmath35 and @xmath63 defined as in ( [ eqn : p1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> these hamiltonians commute with each other , and their lie algebra @xmath64 is only three dimensional . </S>",
    "<S> analogously to the previous example , by exploiting the results of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite one can easily show that the dimension of @xmath65 is again exponential , allowing the full control of all the qubits but the first and the third .    </S>",

    "<S> considering the couple of hamiltonians @xmath39 and @xmath41 with the projection @xmath43 of the above example a , we are sure that there _ exist _ a pair of commutative hamiltonians and a projection such that the projected dynamics is essentially @xmath66 . a standard argument in control </S>",
    "<S> theory is that if a system is fully controllable for a specific choice of parameters , then it is also fully controllable for almost all parameters @xcite . in our case </S>",
    "<S> it implies that _ almost all _ commuting hamiltonians will become universal through the zeno projection on a single qubit ( see appendix for more details ) .    </S>",

    "<S> @xcite , this is no longer the case in quantum mechanics : measurements can indeed be used to directly drive a quantum system even in the absence of a feedback mechanism .    </S>",
    "<S> interestingly enough , for the control scheme we are analyzing here , measurement is not the only way to implement the required projection @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the same effect is attainable by fast unitary kicks and by strong continuous coupling @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , owing to the non - adaptive character of the procedure ( we never need to use the measurement outcomes to implement the control ) , it is also achievable by tailoring a strong dissipative process @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the latter option is of particular interest for us since , along the line of refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , it points out the possibility of taking advantages of the interaction of the system of interest with an external environment , which are typically considered detrimental for quantum processing .    </S>",

    "<S> in fact , the decay process bringing qubit 1 to the state @xmath35 can act as a projection @xmath43 ( see appendix ) , and in the strong - damping limit it is effective in inducing a quantum zeno effect on qubit 1 , yielding the full lie algebra @xmath29 in the rest of the qubit chain . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , due to the same reasoning as the one outlined above , almost all qubit amplitude damping channels induce exponential complexity .    </S>",
    "<S> [ [ conclusions . ] ] conclusions. + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the schemes presented in this work are not meant to be a practical suggestion to implement quantum computers , because the implementation of a control scheme using heisenberg chains would probably be inefficient ( note however @xcite ) . </S>",
