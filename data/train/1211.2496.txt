    "communication occurs between a source - destination pair through a single - hop transmission if they are close enough , or through multi - hop transmissions over intermediate relaying nodes if they are far apart .",
    "the selection of relaying nodes along the multi - hop path is governed by the adopted routing scheme .",
    "the conventional method to establish a routing path between a given source - destination pair is through exchanges of control packets containing the complete network topology information @xcite , which creates scalability issues when the network size becomes large .",
    "one way to reduce the overhead for global topology inquiries is to build routes on demand via flooding techniques @xcite .",
    "however , such routing protocols essentially suffer from a similar issue of large signaling overheads . to deal with the above issues , takagi and",
    "kleinrock @xcite introduced the first geographical ( or position - based ) routing scheme , coined as most forward within radius ( mfr ) , based on the notion of progress : given a transmitting node @xmath3 and a destination node @xmath4 , the progress at relay node @xmath5 is defined as the projection of the line segment @xmath6 onto the line connecting @xmath3 and @xmath4 . in mfr , each node forwards the packet to the neighbor with the largest progress ( e.g. , node @xmath7 in fig .",
    "[ fig : gfrs ] ) , or discards the packet if none of its neighbors are closer to the destination than itself .",
    "there are some other variants of the geographical routing scheme in the literature @xcite@xcite , which are similar to mfr . in @xcite",

    "[ fig : gfrs ] ) ; in @xcite , the compass routing ( also referred to as the dir method ) was proposed , where the neighbor closest to the line connecting the sender and the destination is chosen ( e.g. , node @xmath9 in fig . [",

    "however , it has been shown in @xcite that for dense wireless networks , the mfr - like routing strategies will succeed with high probability and there is no need to resort to recovery methods such as face routing . in this paper",
    "we study the network layer performance of geographical routing schemes in such dense or large wireless networks ; and we expect to observe a similar high - probability successful routing performance ( the proof of this claim is presented in section [ subsec : expected length ] ) .    below we present a methodology employing statistical analysis and stochastic geometry to study geometric routing schemes in wireless ad - hoc networks .",
    "we consider a wireless ad - hoc network consisting of wireless nodes that are distributed according to a poisson point process over a circular area , where nodes are randomly grouped in source - destination pairs and can establish direct communication links with other nodes that are within a certain range .",
    "we determine the conditions under which , in such a network , all source - destination node pairs are connected via the adopted geographical routing scheme with high probability and quantify the asymptotic statistics ( mean and variance ) for the length of the generated routing paths . in particular , we focus on a variant of the geographical routing schemes , namely the random @xmath0disk routing scheme , as an example , where each node chooses the next relay uniformly at random among the nodes in its transmission range over a @xmath0disk with radius @xmath11 oriented towards the destination .",
    "this scheme is similar to the geometric routing scheme discussed in @xcite , in which one of the nodes with forward progress is chosen as a relay at random , arguing that there is a trade - off between progress and transmission success .",
    "we chose the random @xmath0disk routing scheme mainly for tractability and simplicity in mathematical characterization .",
    "however , the solution techniques developed in this paper can be used ( with some modifications ) to study other variants of geographical routing schemes , such as mfr , nfp , dir , etc , which will be further discussed in section [ sec : generalization ] . moreover ,",
    "the random @xmath0disk routing scheme can be used to model situations where nodes have partial or imprecise routing information and the locally optimal selection criterion of greedy forwarding schemes fails @xcite , e.g. , when nodes have perfect knowledge about their destination locations but imprecise information about their own locations , or when nodes only know the half - plane over which the final destination lies such that randomly forwarding the packet to a node in the general direction of the destination is a plausible choice .",
    "there has been a considerable interest regarding the network connectivity and the average length of the route generated by geographical routing schemes under different network settings @xcite , @xcite@xcite .",
    "the authors in @xcite considered a wireless network that consists of @xmath12 nodes uniformly distributed over a disc of unit area with each node transmission covering an area of @xmath13 .",
    "they show that this network is connected asymptotically with probability one _ if and only if _ @xmath14 as @xmath15 .",
    "although the asymptotic expression that they derived for the sufficient transmission range is similar to ours , their notion of connectivity is quite different from ours . in @xcite ,",
    "the network is connected as long as it is percolated , i.e. , the network contains an infinite - order component , where no constraints are considered for the paths connecting source - destination pairs .",
    "however , the routing paths that we consider in this work have more structure such that we need a different proof technique to prove the asymptotic connectivity of the network .",
    ". showed in @xcite that the route establishment can be guaranteed between any source - destination pair using greedy forwarding schemes if the transmission radius is larger than twice the sensing radius in a fully covered homogeneous wireless sensor network . in @xcite",

    "bordenave considered the maximal progress navigation for small world networks and showed that small world navigation is regenerative .",
    "it is shown furthermore in @xcite that as the cardinality of the navigation ( or routing ) path grows , the expected number of hops converges , without providing an explicit value for the limit .",
    "baccelli et al .",
    "@xcite introduced a time - space opportunistic routing scheme for wireless ad - hoc networks which utilizes a self - selection procedure at the receivers .",
    "they show through simulations that such opportunistic schemes can significantly outperform traditional routing schemes when properly optimized .",
    "furthermore , they analytically proved the asymptotic convergence of such schemes . in @xcite , subramanian and",
    "shakkottai studied the routing delay ( measured by the expected length of the routing path ) of geographic routing schemes when the information available to network nodes is limited or imprecise .",
    "they showed that one can still achieve the same delay scaling even with limited information .",
    "note that the asymptotic delay expression derived in @xcite is similar to the one we derive in this paper ; however , our proof technique is more constructive and enables us to derive tight bounds for the mean and the variance of the routing - path lengths in a network of arbitrary size , together with the exact expressions for their asymptotes .",
    "moreover , in @xcite the authors presumes that the progress ( as defined in @xcite and described earlier ) at nodes along the routing path form a sequence of i.i.d . random variables .",
    "however , as we show later ( cf .",
    "proposition [ prop1 ] ) , this assumption may not hold for poisson distributed networks of arbitrary finite sizes as the distribution of nodes contained in the transmission range of a given node along a routing path depends on the history of the routing path up to this node , i.e. , the progress at each hop is history dependent .",
    "hence , it is neither independent nor identically distributed ; but we show that , as the size of the network ( either density or area ) goes to infinity , the conditional distribution of the progresses along the routing path given the two previous hops , in fact , depends asymptotically only on the last hop .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : systemmodel ] we introduce the system model and describe the random @xmath0disk routing scheme .",

    "when the targeted destination node is out of the one - hop transmission range @xmath11 of a given transmitting node , the next relay is selected ( based on some rules ) among the nodes contained in the _ relay selection region _ ( rsr ) of the transmitting node , where the rsr , in general , can be any subset of a full disk of radius @xmath11 centered at the transmitting node .",
    "for example , the rsr for all the geometric routing schemes cited in the introduction section is a _",

    "we define the network to be _ connected _ if for any source - destination node pair in the network , there exists a path constructed by a _ finite sequence of relay nodes _ complying with the rsl , with _ high probability _ ; henceforth , we call such a relay sequence a _ routing path_. note that a node can potentially act as a _ relay _ only if it is contained in the rsr of the current transmitting node . for the sake of definition , we claim that the network is connected if the set of network nodes is empty .    in this paper",
    "we study a special case of localized geometric routing schemes , namely the _ random @xmath0disk routing scheme _ , where for each transmitting node @xmath3 in the network , the next relay @xmath5 is selected _ uniformly at random _ among the nodes contained in the @xmath0rsr of @xmath3 .",
    "we denote the relay selection rule of the random @xmath0disk routing scheme by rrsl .",
    "observe that according to our routing scheme , the next chosen relay might be farther away from the destination than the current transmitting node .    in the following , we present a theorem that summarizes the main results of this paper on the random @xmath0disk routing scheme , regarding i ) the sufficient conditions on @xmath25 , which ensure the existence of a relaying node in any direction of a particular transmitting node based on a generalized version of @xmath0rsr ; ii ) the mathematical model describing the routing path ; iii ) the mean asymptotes of the path - lengths established by the random @xmath0disk routing scheme ; iv ) the corresponding variance asymptotes ; and v ) the asymptotic network connectivity with the random @xmath0disk routing scheme .",

    "<S> in this paper we present a methodology employing statistical analysis and stochastic geometry to study geometric routing schemes in wireless ad - hoc networks . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we analyze the network layer performance of one such scheme , the random @xmath0disk routing scheme , which is a localized geometric routing scheme in which each node chooses the next relay randomly among the nodes within its transmission range and in the general direction of the destination . </S>",
    "<S> the techniques developed in this paper enable us to establish the asymptotic connectivity and the convergence results for the mean and variance of the routing path lengths generated by geometric routing schemes in random wireless networks . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we approximate the progress of the routing path towards the destination by a markov process and determine the sufficient conditions that ensure the asymptotic connectivity for both dense and large - scale ad - hoc networks deploying the random @xmath0disk routing scheme . furthermore , using this markov characterization , we show that the expected length ( hop - count ) of the path generated by the random @xmath0disk routing scheme normalized by the length of the path generated by the ideal direct - line routing , converges to @xmath1 asymptotically . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we show that the variance - to - mean ratio of the routing path length converges to @xmath2 asymptotically . through simulation , we show that the aforementioned asymptotic statistics are in fact quite accurate even for finite granularity and size of the network .    </S>",
