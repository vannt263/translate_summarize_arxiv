    "the puzzling image that emerged from these early studies did not show evidence for intranuclear cascade but rather suggested that the projectile interacted at several points within the nuclear target receiving a transverse momentum `` kick '' at each interaction before undergoing a final violent interaction with a target nucleon .",

    "the parton distribution is dominated by the constituent u , d and s quarks . as the values of x tends toward zero , the population of partons becomes a mixture of gluons and quark - antiquark pairs that emerge as fluctuations from the vacuum @xcite . at the limit of even smaller values of x , gluons are the dominant entities , and the hera measurements found that the gluon density grows as a power in @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "an end to that growth has not yet been measured , but unitarity imposed on the wave function of the target makes the end of that growth all but inevitable .",
