    "definition of an infrared photometric system was begun by johnson and colleagues ( cf .",
    "johnson , 1966 ) . at that time",
    "the @xmath3 and @xmath4 bands were rather arbitrarily defined by quite broad filters centered at around 3.5@xmath5 m and 4.8@xmath5 m .",
    "observations at @xmath3 employed as detectors pbs cells , the long  wave sensitivity limits of which defined the edge of the band , and at @xmath4 much less sensitive , broadband , bolometers or pbse cells were used .",
    "early infrared filters were often single remnants of manufacturers batches and hence systems were not reproducible .",
    "in addition , early infrared filter bandpasses were not well matched to the atmospheric windows , and many absorption features , especially of water , were included . as a consequence the exact bandpass applicable to any given observation depended on the atmospheric water content , and observations were not consistent between different sites or , indeed , at the same site at different times .",
    "the introduction of insb detector technology made it possible to establish a new band , centred at 3.8@xmath5 m  somewhat redwards of the @xmath3 band  which offered a much better match to the transmission of the terrestrial atmospheric window .",
    "this has became known as the @xmath0 band , and has effectively replaced the @xmath3 band , which is no longer commonly used .",
    "an excellent review of the status of the @xmath6 passbands and existing systems , as it was in the late 1980s , is given by bessell & brett ( 1988 ) .",
    "in the mid1980s , as infrared detector sensitivities continued to increase , many observatories found that the high thermal background admitted by the broadband @xmath4 filter saturated the new detectors .",
    "filters with narrower bandpasses were introduced ; these were commonly referred to as @xmath1 .",
    "although the same labels , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , were employed at various observatories , there were often significant differences between the particular filter bandpasses employed and hence between their resulting photometric systems .    in the late 1990s standardization of the near  infrared filter set",
    "was proposed by groups at the gemini observatories and the university of hawaii ( simons & tokunaga , 2002 ; tokunaga , simons & vacca , 2002 ) .",
    "this has been largely achieved by the design of bandpasses which are much less sensitive to varying water vapour conditions , and the organization of a large consortium purchase of these filters .",
    "these filters are now known as the mauna kea observatories near  infrared ( mko  nir ) filter set .",
    "note , however , that they are specifically designed to allow accurate photometry to be performed , and intercompared , at a range of altitudes , and are not simply optimised for the mauna kea site .    as telescope and",
    "detector technology has continued to improve , and fainter and cooler objects are discovered , observations in the thermal infrared have become ever more desirable astronomically .",
    "however , standard stars for the @xmath0 and @xmath4 or @xmath1 bands are still sparse and the available set inhomogeneous . over the last two years staff at the 3.8 m uk infrared telescope ( ukirt ) have therefore undertaken an observing programme to establish an enlarged and homogeneous set of photometric standards , observed with improved accuracy through the mko ",
    "nir @xmath0 and @xmath1 filters , and extending to magnitudes faint enough to be accessible to modern (  small - well \" ) detectors used on 810-m telescopes .",
    "this paper describes that work .",
    "a history of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 filter bandpasses , and of the standard stars employed at ukirt , is given in  2 ; the observational technique in  3 ; the results in  4 ; a discussion in  5 ; and our conclusions in  6 .",
    "the list of standard stars in the @xmath3 , @xmath0 and @xmath4 bandpasses used by observers at ukirt dates from 1992 and is in  house only , having never been formally published ( although at the time of writing it is available on the observatory web pages ) .",
    "magnitudes were derived from elias et al .",
    "( 1982 ) and sinton & tittemore ( 1984 ) supplemented by data from the _ nasa infrared telescope facility photometry manual _ ( 1986 ) .",
    "ukirt observers own observations between 1986 and 1989 were collected in 1989 by s. koyonagi and t. hawarden and used to correct the @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath0 values in the  telescope \" list . a final update based on observations in 199091 and revised transformations to the cit system",
    "was carried out by m.m .",
    "casali in 1992 .",
    "this list is known as the  ukirt bright standards \" .    from the 1990s on",
    ", use of the @xmath3 and the broadband @xmath4 filters ceased at ukirt ; these were replaced by @xmath0 and a narrower  band @xmath1 filter .",
    "observers simply adopted the broad ",
    "band @xmath4 magnitudes to calibrate their narrower ",
    "band @xmath1 data , since tests at the telescope had shown that there was no colour dependency between the filters , at least for spectral types earlier than k ( geballe , 1991 ) ; the presence of photospheric co absorption was expected to lead to differences between @xmath4 and @xmath1 of a few percent for later type stars .",
    "this is discussed further in  4 .",
    "ukirt s 15@xmath5 m imager ircam has a 256@xmath10256 insb detector array . in 1999",
    "ircam was equipped with new optics , giving a smaller pixel field  of  view of 0@xmath1108 . at the same time",
    "it was equipped with the mko  nir @xmath0 and @xmath1 filters ( simon & tokonaga , 2002 ; tokunaga et al . ,",
    "figure 1 compares the previously used `` ukirt '' system @xmath0 bandpass with the mko ",
    "nir filter , and also plots transmission profiles for the old broadband @xmath4 compared with the new mko ",
    "nir @xmath1 .",
    "the filter cold transmission profiles are given in table 1 , together with the profile convolved with dry and wet atmospheric conditions as shown in figure 1 .",
    "the atmospheric transmission spectra were obtained from the gemini observatory web pages and were calculated by lord ( 1992 ) .",
    "nir filters were designed to match the atmospheric windows and to maximise throughput while providing better photometric performance .",
    "simons & tokunaga ( 2002 ) calculate the theoretical photometric error due to non  linear extinction to be 1.4 and 5.9 millimags for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 filters , respectively , for the mauna kea site .",
    "these errors increase to 3.7 and 8.1 millimags at @xmath0 and @xmath1 for a 2  km site .    to investigate the effect of changing water vapour content",
    ", we have synthesised magnitudes for the wet and dry conditions of table 1 for g5v and m7v stars .",
    "stellar theoretical infrared spectra were obtained from cohen ( 2003 , private communication ) and hauschildt , allard & baron ( 1999 ) .",
    "these calculations showed that the effect of variable water content is small : @xmath123 millimags at @xmath0 and @xmath125 millimags at @xmath1 .",
    "the filter profiles shown in figure 1 and listed in table 1 do not include other transmission effects due to telescope and instrument optics and the detector .",
    "the telescope mirrors are aluminised and light is reflected to the instrument from a silver - dielectric coated dichroic tertiary mirror .",
    "the camera has an uncoated calcium fluoride window and contains coated barium fluoride and uncoated lithium fluoride lenses .",
    "the detector is insb with an anti  reflection coating .",
    "prior to installation of the mko  nir filters and modification to a smaller pixel field of view , the camera had one fewer barium fluoride and lithium fluoride lens , and two additional external gold mirrors . the reflection and transmission curves of the dichroic , gold mirrors , calcium fluoride and lithium fluoride lenses are all flat within measurement error over the relevant wavelength range .",
    "the aluminised telescope mirrors have a very small change in reflectivity increasing from 98.0% at 3@xmath5 m to 98.4% at 5@xmath5 m ; the transmission of the barium fluoride lens decreases from 95.6% at 3@xmath5 m to 94.4% at 5@xmath5 m ; and the array quantum efficiency ( qe ) varies between 87.4% and 90.0% .",
    "calculations of synthetic magnitudes for a g5v and an m7v star show that these optical elements effect the derived magnitudes by less than 1 millimag .",
    "to summarise , the previous ukirt system magnitudes , and those published here , are effectively defined by the filter bandpasses and the atmospheric transmission .",
    "we note that the newer generation insb arrays , the 1024@xmath101024 aladdin arrays , have an anti  reflection coating with a more structured wavelength response .",
    "our current thermal imager uses an aladdin detector and also contains barium fluoride lenses whose coating has a 5%deep feature around 3@xmath5 m . the net change to the photometric system",
    "is calculated to be @xmath121 millimag except for late  type stars at @xmath0 where the difference is @xmath133 millimag .",
    "we show in  4 that the measurement errors for the primary standards presented here are typically 0@xmath2015 at @xmath0 and 0@xmath2026 at @xmath1 , therefore variations in the optical design of a 35@xmath5 m imager and telescope system are unlikely to affect the photometric system to any measurable degree .",
    "furthermore , the mko ",
    "nir filters are designed to match the atmospheric windows , and appear to do so well enough that , even at a lower elevation site , the effects of variable water vapour and non  linear extinction are also substantially less than the typical observational error .",
    "overall the results presented here using the mko ",
    "nir filters should be generally useable to calibrate observations with conventionally designed imagers and telescopes and on most sites .",
    "ircam was used for all the observations , with the mko  nir @xmath0 and @xmath1 filters .",
    "observations were made over 26 engineering nights ( or part  nights ) between 1999 september and 2002 july . towards the end of this period ,",
    "once most of the stars were well established , we used calibration data from visiting observers runs to supplement our own measurements .",
    "primary standard stars were selected from the final ukirt bright standards list . to avoid saturation ,",
    "the stars were chosen from amongst the fainter objects on the list , with @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "in addition we observed new @xmath0 secondary standards from the ukirt ( @xmath16 ) faint standards list ( hawarden et al . , 2001 ) , selecting stars that were expected to have @xmath17 .",
    "typically in a full night around 30 stars were observed , divided equally between the three groups : bright @xmath0 primary standards , faint @xmath0 secondary standards and bright @xmath1 primary standards .",
    "the ircam field of view is 20@xmath115 .",
    "observations consisted of sets of four or eight images with the telescope pointing slightly offset between each ; the offsets were kept small enough that the pattern of pointings would fit inside the 20@xmath18 field .",
    "consecutive pairs of images were subtracted and the set of two or four subtracted pairs were combined to give an image containing one positive and one negative detection of the source .",
    "total exposure time for the bright @xmath0 standards was 80 seconds and for the fainter stars it was typically 480 seconds , in both cases made up of sets of four or eight 20-second exposures each in turn consisting of 100 coadded 0.2-second integrations .",
    "exposure time at @xmath1 was usually 216 seconds , made up of sets of four or eight 9-second exposures consisting of 75 coadded 0.12-second integrations .",
    "overheads are about a factor of two due to the extremely short integrations .",
    "a flatfield was created by median filtering the set of four or eight normalised and cleaned observations .",
    "the cleaning removed blemishes on scales smaller than 1 arcsec , achieved by smoothing with a box filter and iteratively rejecting pixels more than two standard deviations from the neighbourhood mean .",
    "it was not necessary to mask objects when creating the flatfield because of the extremely high sky counts in every image .",
    "the flatfielded subtracted images were registered using the telescope offsets  accurate to better than 0.5 arcsec  converted to integer numbers of pixels to avoid resampling .",
    "mosaics of the shifted images were formed using the mean at each pixel , thus preserving flux .",
    "counts on and off target were dominated in all cases by the high sky background and as the stars were reduced in a relative sense ( described below ) , applying a correction for non  linearity was not necessary .",
    "photometry was carried out on both the positive and negative images of the source in the individual sky - subtracted and flatfielded frames as well as in the final flatfielded mosaic .",
    "the photometry aperture was automatically positioned by the software at the source centroid ; the source aperture size used was 5@xmath110 .",
    "although the background counts were close to zero , since consecutive frames had been subtracted from one another , a concentric `` sky '' aperture was used with inner and outer radii at 6@xmath115 and 10@xmath110 .",
    "the sky value was an iteratively clipped mean , emulating the mode .",
    "errors were estimated in the usual way using the variance of the pixel - to - pixel signals in the star and background apertures .",
    "the resulting error estimates were consistent with the difference in the photometry between the positive and negative image of the source , and with the scatter of the results about the observed extinction curves ( see below ) . as a further check , for a single night s observations ,",
    "data variances were created using the read noise and poisson statistics , and propagated through the processing steps .",
    "the photometric errors calculated using the data variance , yielded values some 20 percent larger for the mosaics than the error estimates used in this paper .",
    "typically two to four stars were observed repeatedly ( 4 to 7 times ) during the night to determine the atmospheric extinction ; these stars were brighter stars chosen for their location in the sky .",
    "these extinction stars were observed at airmasses as high as 2.0 , typically other stars were observed at an airmass less than 1.6 .",
    "the extinction was determined by a linear fit to the observed instrumental magnitude as a function of airmass .",
    "the results ranged from 0.08 to 0.15 magnitudes / airmass ( hereinafter mag / am ) at @xmath0 , with an average value of 0.11 mag / am , and ranged from 0.18 to 0.29 mag / am at @xmath1 , with an average value of 0.23 mag / am .",
    "the error on the extinction value was on average 0.03 mag / am at @xmath0 and 0.05 mag / am at @xmath0 .",
    "tokunaga et al . ( 2002 ) calculate the extinction for the mko ",
    "nir @xmath0 and @xmath1 filters ; they find that a linear fit should be accurate to better than 0@xmath2005 .",
    "the slope should not be strongly dependent on the amount of water in the atmosphere : for a range in precipitable water vapour of 0.5  mm to 4.0  mm the @xmath0 extinction should vary from 0.09 to 0.11 mag / am and the @xmath1 extinction from 0.20 to 0.24 mag / am .",
    "our observed range of extinction values appears to be larger than predicted . however , the measurement errors are such that this this difference is not significant , and we note that the means of our measured values agree with the predictions of tokunaga et al .",
    "no significant correlation between our measured extinctions and the atmospheric water vapour content is evident .",
    "the stars not used for extinction were observed once or twice a night .",
    "each night s data was reduced in a relative sense : after using the extinction stars to define a mean extinction value , the primary targets were used to define a mean zeropoint at an airmass of unity .",
    "the fainter secondary standards were calibrated using these values for zeropoint and extinction .",
    "as each night s data were reduced , the deviation from the ensemble mean zeropoint for that night of the individual zeropoints from each primary standard was derived .",
    "this was applied as a correction to the catalogue magnitudes for these stars , producing an evolving working catalogue to replace the original .",
    "the evolving value was used in deriving the ensemble zeropoint , and individual deviations , on the next night , and the process repeated .",
    "gives our @xmath0 results for the stars from the ukirt bright standards list .",
    "spectral types for these stars were found from the simbad database .",
    "the number of measurements is the number of nights on which the star was observed , i.e. if the star was observed more than once on a given night the mean result is counted as a single independent observation .",
    "results were weighted according to the measurement error for each night . gives the @xmath0 results for the fainter stars from the ukirt faint standards of hawarden et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , whence the spectral types are taken .",
    "gives the @xmath1 results , where , again , the number of measurements are the number of nights observed and spectral types are from simbad . for all of tables 2 through 4 , the value of @xmath19 given in the sixth column is the value of the standard error of the mean over all the nights included in the measurements ; accordingly , no @xmath19 value is shown for stars measured on only one night .",
    "this @xmath19 may underestimate the true external error , as we discuss below .",
    "for the stars observed more than three times , any measurement that deviated from the mean by more than three sigma was rejected  typically these deviations were @xmath200@xmath208 .",
    "@xmath0 measurements were rejected for hd18881 , sao112626 , hd84800 , hd161903 , fs104 , fs123 , fs125 , fs147 , fs149 and fs155 .",
    "@xmath1 measurements were rejected for hd84800 and hd129653 . in all",
    "cases single measurements were discarded , except for sao112626 and fs155 where two @xmath0 measurements were discarded .",
    "we interpret these deviant values as simply bad data and not as evidence of variability at @xmath0 or @xmath1 .",
    "all the stars have been measured on several nights at near  infrared and , in most cases , optical wavelengths .",
    "the bright ( primary ) stars were observed in the @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath3 bands on numerous occasions at ukirt ( see above ) and at ctio and kpno ( elias et al . , 1982 ) over more than a decade .",
    "the faint stars have been observed at @xmath16 an average of 7 ( minimum : 3 , maximum : 12 ) times over the period 19941998 ( hawarden et al .",
    "2001 ) and in two cases are landolt ( 1992 ) standards with numerous observations in the optical . none have been suspected to vary .",
    "since stellar variability is usually larger in amplitude at shorter wavelengths ( barring large changes in atmospheric structure , such as dust formation , unlikely in stars as carefully selected for stability and normality as these ) changes of significant amplitude must be regarded as unlikely .",
    "an exception to this may be fs 101 , for which the error in the mean @xmath0 value remained high despite repeat measurements .",
    "this f0 star did not show any signs of variability at @xmath16 ( hawarden et al .",
    "2001 ) but seven @xmath0 measurements showed a range of 0@xmath21 with a standard error in the mean of 0@xmath205 .",
    "we note that the sample includes two b supergiants , bs 696 and bs 8541 , as @xmath1 standards .",
    "although it is possible that free  free emission from potentially variable stellar winds contributes to their @xmath1 flux there is currently no evidence of variability .",
    "sinton & tittemore ( 1984 ) observed these stars 67 times and they have also been observed numerous times at ukirt ( bs 8541 is flagged as a frequently observed star in the ukirt bright standards list ) .",
    "note that if there is a significant contribution from a stellar wind then the stars will have atypical colours and should not be used for system transformations .",
    "combines all the measurements in one table , and also lists right ascension and declination , proper motion and spectral type .",
    "here we have estimated the external errors as follows .",
    "on individual nights the scatter around the mean extinction curve for stars observed more than once was typically 0@xmath202 for the bright @xmath0 standards , and 0@xmath203 for the fainter @xmath0 standards and for the @xmath1 standards .",
    "this is only slightly worse than the average calculated error of an individual measurement , based on signal  to  noise statistics .",
    "accordingly , if the star was observed on @xmath21 nights then our adopted uncertainty in is the larger of @xmath22/ \\sqrt(n-1)$ ] or the internal standard deviation of the mean given in tables 13 .",
    "the number of observations in is the number of nights on which the star was observed in each filter . a combination of lack of photometric weather and the replacement of ircam by another instrument necessitated the termination of this programme when some stars had fewer than three observations .",
    "these stars , and those with estimated error larger than 0@xmath203 , should be treated with appropriate caution , as perhaps should the two b supergiants mentioned above .",
    "figure 2 plots , for the brighter stars , the difference between our @xmath0 and @xmath1 magnitudes on the mko system and the previously listed values on the ukirt @xmath0 and broadband @xmath4 systems .",
    "the differences are plotted as a function of colour , expressed as @xmath23 on the ukirt system ( not mko ) , and of brightness at @xmath0 or @xmath1 .    at @xmath0",
    "the mean absolute difference between the current and previous measurements is 0@xmath202 , consistent with our uncertainties and the estimated error in the older measurements ( e.g. the two stars with @xmath24 in sinton & tittemore ( 1984 ) have a quoted uncertainty of 0@xmath202 and 0@xmath205 in their ) .",
    "there is no evidence of a colour term ; instead the stars with the largest deviations from the previously tabulated value are fainter , suggesting larger errors in the original measurements .",
    "the latest spectral type in this sample is m5.5 .",
    "it is known that for ultracool objects , of spectral type l5 and later , there will be a difference in magnitude measured with the previous ukirt @xmath0 and the current mko  nir @xmath0 filter .",
    "this is due to the onset of methane absorption at the blue edge of the mko ",
    "nir bandpass ( leggett et al . , 2002 ) .",
    "such objects are not currently used as standards .    at @xmath1",
    "the mean absolute difference between the current and previous measurements is 0@xmath205 , again consistent with our estimated errors and those of the older measurements ( e.g. the two stars with @xmath25 in sinton & tittemore ( 1984 ) have quoted errors of 0@xmath203 and 0@xmath206 ) .",
    "again , the deviation is larger for fainter targets suggesting a larger error in the original measurement .",
    "there are insufficient red stars in common to determine whether or not a colour term exists between @xmath4 and @xmath1 magnitudes .",
    "although a dependency was expected for types k and later due to photospheric co absorption , we have synthesised broadband @xmath4 and @xmath1 magnitudes for a late  m dwarf and for an early  k giant ( using models from hauschildt , allard & baron ( 1999 ) for the former and the observationally based templates of cohen et al . ( 1999 ) for the latter ) and found the difference to be only 0@xmath2005 , presumably because both filters include the co band . in any case",
    ", as broadband @xmath4 is no longer used this is not an issue for modern work .",
    "we have presented new @xmath0 observations , using the mko  nir filter , of 25 stars with @xmath26 . the average internal standard error of the mean result for each star is 0@xmath2010 , the estimated external error ranges from 0@xmath2010 to 0@xmath2025 .",
    "most of these stars have previously tabulated @xmath0 values on the `` ukirt '' system .",
    "the difference between the ukirt and mko values are typically 0@xmath202 , with one larger deviation of 0@xmath209 for the faintest star in the sample .",
    "there is no evidence of a colour dependency in @xmath27 for stars as late as m5.5 .",
    "data with the same filter are presented for 21 stars with @xmath28 , taken from the ukirt @xmath16 faint standards list .",
    "the average internal standard error of the mean results is 0@xmath202 , the estimated external error ranges from 0@xmath202 to 0@xmath205 .",
    "these stars will be useful as standards for larger telescopes , and convenient for programs on such telescopes which require calibration of all four of the @xmath29 bands .",
    "we also present @xmath1 observations , using the mko  nir filter , of 31 stars with @xmath30 .",
    "the average internal standard error of the mean results is 0@xmath202 , while the estimated external error ranges from 0@xmath202 to 0@xmath205 .",
    "most of these stars have previously tabulated broadband @xmath4 magnitudes ; and the difference between @xmath4 and mko ",
    "nir @xmath1 is typically 0@xmath205 although there are two stars that differ by @xmath310@xmath21 ; these are fainter stars that most likely have larger uncertainties in the original measurements .",
    "the new data will allow more accurate calibration of @xmath4band photometry on a wide range of telescopes .",
    "systematic errors in the photometry due to non  linear extinction or variable water vapour are calculated to be @xmath124 millimags at @xmath0 and @xmath128 millimags at @xmath1 , for sites as low as 2  km .",
    "investigation of the transmissive or reflective elements of ukirt and its imagers implies that commonly used optical elements will introduce variations in the photometric system of @xmath123 millimag .",
