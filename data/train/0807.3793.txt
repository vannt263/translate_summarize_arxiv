    "x - ray diffraction experiments using high - brilliance synchrotron radiation source , however , reported different phase diagrams .",

    "although the monoclinic @xmath0 structure is ascertained to be stable up to about 5 gpa at low temperatures in both experiments , the stable structure at pressures between 5 - 7 gpa is considered to be still open question . for higher pressures",
    ", recent x - ray diffraction experiments have revealed that @xmath7-o@xmath1 consists of o@xmath8 clusters  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath7 phase transforms to the metallic @xmath9 phase at higher pressure ( @xmath10 100 gpa ) and finally to a superconducting state  @xcite .",

    "we performed theoretical calculations using _ ab - initio _ pair - potentials and reported that the monoclinic @xmath0 structure is stable up to 6 gpa  @xcite .",
    "a part of the results will be presented in this paper .",
    "first - principles investigations based on density functional theory ( dft )  @xcite were performed especially for higher pressure phases @xmath7 and @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "the predicted structures for insulating @xmath7-o@xmath1 is however not consistent with the experimental one .",
    "this is caused by a failure of the local density approximation ( lda ) in describing the magnetic interaction between oxygen molecules  @xcite . because the failure does not influence the metallic state calculations ,",
    "the structural relaxation based on dft with an appropriate starting structure can predict the structure of the @xmath9 phase .",
    "a recent first - principles study reported a plausible structure for the metallic @xmath9 phase  @xcite . in this paper , we study the insulating @xmath0 and @xmath2 phases . the total energy is evaluated as a superposition of pair - potentials obtained by quantum chemistry calculations including configuration interactions .",
    "under low pressures , solid oxygen consists of weakly bound oxygen molecules . therefore the interactions between molecules need to be reproduced exactly in order to calculate the structure .",
    "the total energy calculation based on dft is often used to investigate structures of various crystals .",
    "unfortunately , dft calculations within the lda ( or with gradient corrections ) does not give correct intermolecular interactions for magnetic oxygen molecules .",
    "it is related with the symmetries of the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) , and the well - known bandgap - underestimation problem of the lda  @xcite .",
    "both of the homo and lumo of interacting oxygen molecules are originated in the @xmath11 ( gerade ) orbital of o@xmath1 .",
    "thus the underestimation of the homo - lumo gap cause a serious overestimation of the exchange energy .",
    "we actually confirm dft calculations do not reproduce the @xmath0 structure at zero pressure . in many cases , quantum chemistry calculations including",
    "the configuration interactions reproduce intermolecular interactions correctly . in this paper",
    ", we evaluate the total energy as a superposition of intermolecular potentials ( pair - potentials ) calculated by an _ ab - initio _ method with configuration interactions .    in order to reduce degrees of freedom of the o@xmath12 system",
    ", we introduce following assumptions into the calculations .    1 .   an antiferromagnetic ordering in the @xmath13 ( basal ) plane .",
    "2 .   the @xmath5 lattice symmetry .",
    "3 .   a molecular axis perpendicular to the @xmath13 plane .",
    "these assumptions are consistent with known properties of the structure of @xmath0-o@xmath1 , and we can treat the orthorhombic @xmath2 structure as a special case that the monoclinic angle @xmath14 .    in the orthorhombic structure ,",
    "two types of the magnetic ordering along the @xmath15-axis are allowed : the ferromagnetic or anti - ferromagnetic orderings . in the @xmath0 phase ,",
    "the magnetic ordering along the @xmath15-axis is obviously ferromagnetic because of the periodicity along @xmath15-direction .",
    "although recent neutron diffraction experiment reported anti - ferromagnetic ordering along the @xmath15-axis in the @xmath2 phase  @xcite , we assume the ferromagnetic ordering along the @xmath15-axis because it simplify the treatment of the transition from @xmath0 to @xmath2 phases .",
    "we have however confirmed that the difference in the total energy between the two kinds of orderings on the same lattice is very small .",
    "it is ascribed to the weak magnetic interaction between molecules in different @xmath15-layers .    following the assumption 1 , there are two kinds of pairs of oxygen molecules .",
    "one is the pair in which magnetic moments are parallel ( ferromagnetic pair , f ) .",
    "the other is the pair in which magnetic moments are anti - parallel ( antiferromagnetic , af ) .",
    "assumptions 2 and 3 restrict geometric configuration of molecules .",
    "in addition to these assumptions , we fix the inter - atomic distance in o@xmath1 . by these constraints ,",
    "degrees of freedom of the o@xmath12 system , in other words the number of geometric parameters of pair - potentials , are reduced from twelve to two .",
    "remaining degrees of freedom are the relative position of molecules .",

    "the calculated pressure dependences of lattice parameters up to 6 gpa are shown in figures  3(a),(b ) and ( c ) .",
    "the results of higher pressure , which is also shown in the figures , will be discussed later . in figures , solid lines",
    "present calculated lattice parameters , and closed circles , triangles and diamonds are experimental results  @xcite .",
    "the values of pressure are evaluated by the numerical differentiation of the total energy with respect to the volume ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "as previously mentioned , raman and theoretical studies reported phase transitions in this pressure range  @xcite .",
    "the structural transition predicted by the theoretical calculation was accompanied by abrupt changes of lattice parameters at 2.3 gpa .",
    "as shown in figure  3 , present results decrease continuously with increasing pressure and there are no sign of the structural transition to the @xmath2 structure up to 6 gpa .    as shown in figure  3(a ) , the crystal is less compressible along the @xmath6-axis than the @xmath27-axis .",
    "the relation of the anisotropic lattice compressibility and the af ordering in the @xmath13 plane is discussed by akahama _",
    "the @xmath28 ratio is 0.638 at zero pressure , and it increases with pressure and reaches 0.691 at 6 gpa . the experimental value is 0.635 at zero pressure  @xcite , and it reaches 0.687 at 6 gpa  @xcite .",
    "the agreement between the calculation and experiments is very satisfactory .",
    "as previously reported , the crystal structure of @xmath0-o@xmath1 is considered as a result of magnetic interactions between oxygen molecules  @xcite . in order to clarify how the magnetic interactions affect the crystal structure , we consider a simple model of the @xmath13 plane as shown in figure  4 .",
    "this figure shows the top view of the @xmath13 plane .",
    "the molecular axes are perpendicular to the figure , and arrows represent magnetic moment directions of o@xmath1 molecules .",
    "the unit cell contains ten pair of oxygen molecules : four af pairs at a distance @xmath29 and three kinds of f pairs at distances @xmath27 , @xmath6 and @xmath30 . for simplicity , we neglect interactions between molecules in which intermolecular distances are @xmath30 . consequently the ( total ) energy of this system is written as @xmath31 ~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 and @xmath33 denote interactions ( pair - potentials ) of the af and f pairs at a distance @xmath34 . calculated intermolecular potentials @xmath32 and @xmath33 , which correspond to @xmath35 and @xmath36 in ( [ etot ] ) , are shown in figure  5 .",
    "optimal energy of ( [ etotmodel ] ) are obtained at ( @xmath37 ) = ( 5.42 , 3.41 , 3.20 ) , and those are indicated by arrows in the figure .",
    "the obtained values are very close to the experimental values at zero pressure ( 5.40 , 3.43 , 3.20 )  @xcite .",
    "evidently ( [ etotmodel ] ) is dominated by the first term because of its coefficient and the fact that @xmath32 has deeper minimum than @xmath33 .",
    "thus we obtain the optimal value of @xmath38 , @xmath39 where @xmath40 takes the lowest energy .",
    "then the problem is simplified as @xmath41 , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "@xmath44 takes a minimum on the condition @xmath45 , i.e. , @xmath46 this condition is symmetric for @xmath6 and @xmath27 , then @xmath47 satisfies the condition .",
    "it gives , however , the highest energy because @xmath48 is negative at @xmath49 as shown in figure  5 .",
    "another solution @xmath50 of ( [ cond ] ) is located at slightly larger side of the minimum of @xmath33 : around 3.4 . as a result ,",
    "the optimal value of @xmath38 and @xmath6 , the structure of the @xmath13 plane therefore , strongly depend on the position of the minimum of @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the difference of @xmath32 and @xmath33 corresponds to the exchange energy . if there are no magnetic interactions between the molecules , @xmath32 is equivalent to @xmath33 . in this case , following the above discussion , the optimal value of @xmath38 is equal to @xmath50 and it gives the close - packed triangular lattice .",
    "the distortion is not introduced if there are only one kind of pair - potential .",
    "namely the origin of the distorted triangular lattice in the @xmath0 phase is attributed to the existence of the two kinds of pair - potentials , in other words , the magnetic interaction .",
    "the anisotropic lattice compressibility of the @xmath13 plane , which is pointed out by akahama _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , can be easily understood from figure  5 .",
    "first we consider a situation that the lattice is compressed along the @xmath27-axis and the length along the @xmath6-axis is fixed . in this case , @xmath38 decrease following the relation @xmath51 and the first term of ( [ etotmodel ] ) increases by the repulsive interaction .",
    "some part of the increased energy is however cancelled out by the term of @xmath52 because it is in the attractive region . on the other hand , when the lattice is compressed along the @xmath6-axis and @xmath27-direction is fixed , both term of @xmath40 and @xmath53 increase , and as a result the total energy @xmath54 increase steeply compared with the previous case .",
    "this is the origin of the anisotropic lattice compressibility of the @xmath0 phase .",
    "x - ray diffraction experiments by akahama _",
    "et al . _ and gorelli _ et al .",
    "_ showed the monoclinic @xmath0 structure is stable up to higher pressure than the previously proposed transition pressure . around 6 gpa , however , they proposed different structures .",
    "_ reported a direct structural transformation from @xmath0- to @xmath7-o@xmath1 at 7.2 gpa . on the contrary ,",
    "gorelli _ et al .",
    "_ found @xmath2-o@xmath1 between @xmath0- and @xmath7-o@xmath1 . in this section",
    ", we discuss the stability of @xmath0- and @xmath2-o@xmath1 .    in figure  3 ,",
    "dashed lines above 6 gpa show lattice parameters of optimal structure . the dotted lines present extrapolated values from the data below 6 gpa , namely those form monoclinic @xmath0 structure .",
    "although optimal values ( dashed lines ) show the orthorhombic structure is stable above 6 gpa , the energy of the orthorhombic structure is very close to that of the monoclinic ( dotted lines ) structure .",
    "since the @xmath2-o@xmath1 can be considered as a special case of @xmath0-o@xmath1 ( @xmath55=90@xmath56 ) , we illustrate the total energy as a function of @xmath55 and pressure .",
    "figure  6 presents a pressure dependence of the cross section of the total energy from 4 gpa to 7 gpa . in the figure ,",
    "lattice constants @xmath27 ,",
    "@xmath6 and the volume of the unit cell are fixed to optimal values presented by the solid and dashed lines in figure  3(a ) . therefore the independent parameter is only @xmath55 at each pressure . at the low pressure range , the total energy takes minima at two values of @xmath55 , which give equivalent monoclinic @xmath0 structures , and the orthorhombic structure ( @xmath57 ) is unstable . with adopted constraints of the crystal structure and geometric configurations of molecules ,",
    "it can be derived analytically that a first derivative of the total energy with respect to @xmath55 is zero at @xmath57 ( orthorhombic structure ) at each pressure , i.e. , the total energy takes a maximum or minimum values at the @xmath2 structure  @xcite . with increasing pressure ,",
    "the @xmath2 structure becomes stable at around 6 gpa in place of the @xmath0 structure , the energy difference between these structure is however less than 0.5 mev ( @xmath10 5 k ) even at 7 gpa .",
    "unfortunately , in the precision of present calculations , the energy difference may be too small to decide which structure is stable .",
    "we obtained however an important result that the monoclinic - angle - dependence of the total energy is very small in this pressure range .",
    "et al . _ and gorelli _ et al . _",
    "proposed different structures in this pressure range .",
    "it is reasonable because the experiments were performed at temperatures higher than the energy difference we obtained .",
    "the very small energy difference in this pressure range implies that several structures which have various monoclinic angles can be allowed at finite temperature .",
    "et al . _ performed raman scattering experiments and observed peaks above 5 gpa  @xcite . although the origin of the peaks is unresolved , they indicated the existence of the complicated mixed phase at this pressure range .",
    "further investigations are desired to determine the origin of the unknown peaks .    at high temperatures",
    ", many experiments demonstrated the stability of orthorhombic @xmath2-o@xmath1 .",
    "the stability of @xmath2-o@xmath1 at high temperature is understood from figure  6 . as shown in the figure , the energy surface forms a double - well or parabolic shape . in either case",
    ", they are symmetric with respect to @xmath55 around @xmath57 and the energy barrier separating the wells are very low .",
    "therefore the expectation value of @xmath55 becomes 90@xmath56 even at low pressure because of the effect of thermal excitations .",
    "akahama _ et al .",
    "_ reported abrupt changes of lattice parameters at the phase boundary of the @xmath0 and @xmath7 phases . in the present calculations , however , corresponding change of lattice parameters are not obtained up to 12 gpa .",
    "this may be caused by constraints on the crystal and/or magnetic structure in our calculations .",
    "recent neutron diffraction experiment shows a disappearance of the magnetic long - range ordering in the @xmath7 phase , but it does not exclude the short - range order  @xcite .",
    "intermolecular potentials adaptable to other magnetic configurations may be required to obtain the @xmath7 structure .",
    "we investigated crystal structures of solid oxygen under pressure with _ ab - initio _ pair - potentials taking account of the difference of spin states . under 6 gpa ,",
    "the obtained structure is monoclinic @xmath0 and calculated lattice parameters agree well with the results of the x - ray diffraction experiment .",
    "the origin of the distortion of the basal plane and that of the anisotropic lattice compressibility of @xmath0-o@xmath1 are clearly demonstrated that they are caused by the existence of two kinds of intermolecular interaction , namely magnetic interactions .",
    "the crystal structure under the pressure range from 6 to 7 gpa is discussed using the total energy surface projected on the @xmath58-@xmath55 space .",
    "although orthorhombic @xmath2-o@xmath1 is obtained as the stable structure , the energy difference between @xmath0- and @xmath2-o@xmath1 is less than 5 k in this pressure range .",
