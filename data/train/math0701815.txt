    "generalizing hopf s formula  @xcite for the second integral homology group to higher dimensions is a well - studied problem , that still deserves to be better understood from a categorical perspective .",
    "partial results were originally obtained by conrad  @xcite , rodicio  @xcite and sthr  @xcite , and the first complete solution  a formula describing @xmath5 for all @xmath6is due to brown and ellis  @xcite .",
    "their work was recently extended by donadze , inassaridze and porter in the paper  @xcite .",
    "whereas brown and ellis use topological methods , the latter proof is entirely algebraic , and also considers the case of groups vs.  @xmath4-nilpotent groups instead of just groups vs.  abelian groups .",
    "the aim of our present paper is two - fold : giving a conceptual and elementary proof of the higher hopf formulae , while at the same time placing them in a very general framework . in our opinion , the simplest approach to a formula for @xmath5 is a proof by induction on @xmath6 . now even for groups",
    ", such an approach naturally leads to the use of categorical methods : the familiar category of groups must be left for more general ones . on the other hand ,",
    "consequent reasoning along such lines gives a lot of added generality for free .",
    "how general can we go ?",
    "just to give an idea : brown and ellis s formulae describe @xmath5 for groups vs.  abelian groups ; donadze , inassaridze and porter add groups vs.  @xmath4-nilpotent groups for arbitrary @xmath4 ; we add groups vs.  @xmath4-solvable groups , lie algebras vs.  abelian lie algebras , rings vs.  zero rings , precrossed modules vs.  crossed modules , etc .",
    "furthermore , even for groups , this yields a proof that s less complicated than the existing ones , and essentially amounts to an application of the hopf formula for the second homology object and some standard diagram chasing arguments .",
    "while based on the same basic idea of using higher dimensional extensions and , in particular , higher presentations of an object , the main difference between our method and previous ones is that we can use an inductive argument , because our formula for @xmath7 also holds in categories of higher extensions .    that such an approach is possible is due to the existence of the appropriate categorical framework , janelidze , mrki and tholen s _ semi - abelian categories _  @xcite and borceux and bourn s _ homological categories _  @xcite .",
    "these were introduced to capture the fundamental homological properties of the categories of groups , rings , lie algebras , crossed modules etc .",
    "much in the same way as abelian categories do for modules over a ring or sheaves of abelian groups .",
    "our work confirms how well the notion of semi - abelian ( or homological ) category fulfils this promise .",
    "an important ingredient to understanding the higher hopf formulae is janelidze s insight that _ centralization of higher extensions _ yields the objects that occur in these formulae  @xcite .",
    "for instance , consider a group @xmath8 presented by a double extension @xmath9 @xmath10_-{q } \\ar@{- { > > } } [ r ] & f / k_2 \\ar@{- { > > } } [ d]^-{p}\\\\ f / k_1 \\ar@{- { > > } } [ r ] & a}}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are normal subgroups of @xmath13 satisfying @xmath14 and such that @xmath13 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are free groups .",
    "then the third homology group with coefficients in the group of integers @xmath17 is given by @xmath18\\cap k_1\\cap k_2}{l_{2}[f]},\\ ] ] where the object @xmath19=[k_1\\cap k_2 , f ] \\cdot [ k_1,k_2]$ ] , a kind of higher commutator , is defined by the _ centralization _",
    "\\ar@{. { > > } } [ d ] \\ar@{. { > > } } [ r ] & { f / k_2 } \\ar@{- { > > } } [ d]\\\\ { f / k_1 } \\ar@{- { > > } } [ r ] & a}\\ ] ] of @xmath21the double extension @xmath21 universally turned into a central one .",
    "of course , such a _",
    "double presentation _",
    "@xmath21 always exists : consider the underlying set / free group comonad @xmath22 and take the diagram @xmath23_-{g\\epsilon_{a } } \\ar@{- { > > } } [ r]^-{\\epsilon_{ga } } & ga \\ar@{- { > > } } [ d]^-{\\epsilon_{a}}\\\\ ga \\ar@{- { > > } } [ r]_-{\\epsilon_{a } } & a}}\\ ] ] for @xmath21 . in the case of groups",
    ", janelidze realized that also the higher hopf formulae may be interpreted in these terms  @xcite .",
    "as far as we know , our paper is the first attempt to use this idea for proving the formulae .",
    "next to the concept of semi - abelian categories , part of the fundamental theory is provided by the paper  @xcite , where a proof along the same lines is given of the hopf formula for the second homology object , and some of the needed homological tools are developed .",
    "a categorical theory of central extensions was developed by janelidze and kelly in  @xcite as an application of janelidze s categorical galois theory  @xcite .",
    "this theory is modelled on the situation where @xmath0 is a variety of universal algebras and @xmath1 a given subvariety of @xmath0 , and allows one to classify the extensions in @xmath0 that are _ central _ with respect to this chosen subvariety @xmath1 .",
    "the idea of relative centrality  which goes back to the work of the frhlich school , see e.g. ,  @xcite  has for leading example the variety of groups with its subvariety of abelian groups .",
    "janelidze and kelly s theory is general enough to include the case where @xmath0 is any semi - abelian category and @xmath1 is any given birkhoff subcategory of @xmath0 . modelling the notion of centralization of higher extensions in a categorical way",
    ", we are forced to extend this theory , but still within the framework of categorical galois theory .",
    "the resulting process of centralization of higher extensions then provides us with the higher commutators that occur in the higher hopf formulae .    in the last section",
    "we explain how these commutators may be calculated explicitly , and we do so in some specific cases : groups vs.  abelian groups , groups vs.  @xmath4-nilpotent groups , groups vs.  @xmath4-solvable groups , precrossed modules vs.  crossed modules . in the important example of precrossed modules",
    "the homology objects are described by the same formula ( see theorem  [ thm - pxmod ] ) : indeed , the so - called peiffer commutator plays the same role , in the category of precrossed modules , as the usual commutator of normal subgroups does in the category of groups .",
    "as pointed out above , semi - abelian and homological categories were introduced to capture the homological properties of those categories `` sufficiently close '' to the category @xmath2 of all groups . in this section",
    "we briefly recall their definition and basic properties .",
    "it is important to note that in general , the difference between a semi - abelian category and an abelian one is quite vast : in an abelian category , every morphism may be factored as a cokernel followed by a kernel ; any hom - set @xmath24 carries an abelian group structure ; binary products and binary coproducts coincide .",
    "none of these properties holds true for the category @xmath2 of groups : the first one because not every subgroup is a normal subgroup , the second one essentially because the pointwise product of two group homomorphisms need not be a homomorphism , and the third one because a group @xmath8 with @xmath25 is always trivial . in view of these differences , it is easily understood why the definition of semi - abelian category might sound unfamiliar at first . nevertheless , the link with the notion of semi - abelian category is simple and precise : a category @xmath0 is abelian if and only if both @xmath0 and its dual category @xmath26 are semi - abelian  @xcite .    [ definition - semi - abelian ] a category @xmath0 is _ semi - abelian _ when it is pointed , barr exact and bourn protomodular and has binary coproducts  @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 is _ homological _",
    "@xcite when it is pointed , regular and bourn protomodular .    of course",
    "some explanation is needed .",
    "first of all , in a semi - abelian category , all finite limits and colimits exist .",
    "in particular , there is a terminal object @xmath27 and an initial object @xmath28 , and it is possible to construct finite products and coproducts , equalizers and coequalizers , pullbacks and pushouts . @xmath0 being _ pointed _ means that @xmath29 , i.e. , there is a _",
    "zero _ object : an object that is both initial and terminal .",
    "a map is called _ zero _ when it factors over @xmath28 ; given any two objects @xmath8 and @xmath30 , there is a unique zero map from @xmath30 to @xmath8 .",
    "this makes it possible to consider kernels and cokernels : given a morphism @xmath31 in @xmath0 , a _ kernel _",
    "@xmath32{\\longrightarrow}b}$ ] of @xmath21 is a pullback of @xmath33 along @xmath21 and dually , a _",
    "@xmath34}$ ] is a pushout of @xmath35 along @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath0 being _ barr exact _ means that it is regular , and such that every internal equivalence relation in @xmath0 is a kernel pair  @xcite .",
    "we start by commenting on the regularity , and later come back to the other condition .",
    "recall that a morphism is called a _",
    "regular epimorphism _ when it is a coequalizer of some pair of arrows .",
    "having finite limits and coequalizers of kernel pairs , @xmath0 is _ regular _ when moreover the regular epimorphisms of @xmath0 are pullback - stable . in a regular category ,",
    "image factorizations exist : any morphism @xmath31 can be factored as a regular epimorphism @xmath36}$ ] followed by a monomorphism @xmath37{\\longrightarrow}a}$ ] called the _ image _ of  @xmath21 ; this factorization is unique up to isomorphism .",
    "a morphism @xmath21 such that @xmath38 is a kernel is called _ proper_.    in this pointed and regular context , @xmath0 is _ bourn protomodular _",
    "@xcite if and only if the ( regular ) _ short five lemma _ holds : this means that for every commutative diagram @xmath39 \\ar@ { { > } ->}[r]^-{{\\ensuremath{\\mathsf{ker\\,}}}f_{0 } } \\ar[d]_-k & b_{0 } \\ar@{->>}[r]^-{f_{0 } } \\ar[d]^-b & a_{0 } \\ar[d]^-a \\\\   k[f ] \\ar@ { { > } ->}[r]_-{{\\ensuremath{\\mathsf{ker\\,}}}f } & b \\ar@{->>}[r]_-{f } & a}\\ ] ] such that @xmath21 and @xmath40 are regular epimorphisms , @xmath4 and @xmath41 being isomorphisms entails that @xmath42 is an isomorphism .",
    "this implies that every regular epimorphism is in fact a cokernel ( of its kernel ) .",
    "accordingly , we can define exact sequences as follows .",
    "a  sequence of morphisms @xmath43 @xmath44 & a_{i+1 } \\ar[r]^-{f_{i+1 } } & a_{i } \\ar[r]^-{f_{i } } & a_{i-1}\\ar[r ] & \\dots}\\ ] ] is called _ exact at @xmath45 _ if @xmath46 .",
    "( in particular , then @xmath47 is proper . )",
    "it is called _ exact _ when it is exact at @xmath45 , for all @xmath48 . sequence  [ short - exact - sequence ] below @xmath49 & k \\ar@ { { > } ->}[r]^-{k } & b   \\ar@{-{>>}}[r]^-{f } & a \\ar[r ] & 0}\\ ] ] is exact if and only if it represents @xmath50 as a _ short exact sequence _ : @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "finally , under the above assumptions , @xmath0 will be barr exact if and only if the direct image of a kernel along a regular epimorphism is a kernel : given any kernel @xmath4 and any regular epimorphism @xmath21 in @xmath0 , their composition @xmath53 is proper  its image @xmath54 is a kernel .",
    "examples of semi - abelian categories include all abelian categories ; any variety of @xmath55-groups : amongst the operations defining it , there is a group operation and a unique constant ( the unit of the group operation ) , in particular , the categories of groups , ( non - unital ) rings , ( pre)crossed modules , lie algebras over a field , commutative algebras ; compact hausdorff groups ; @xmath56-algebras ; the dual of the category of pointed sets .    for some applications , having a homological category instead of a semi - abelian one will be sufficient .",
    "for instance , the category of topological groups and of torsion - free abelian groups are homological but not semi - abelian , and we shall meet another example in section  [ section - higher - extensions ] below . yet , already in this context the basic homological diagram lemma s hold : the _ snake lemma _ , the _ @xmath57-lemma _",
    "in this section we recall the basic definition of _ categorical galois structure _ , which is crucial for the study of higher central extensions .",
    "in particular we give a useful sufficient condition for a galois structure to be _",
