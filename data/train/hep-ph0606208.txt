    "qcd has an approximate flavor symmetry which is determined by the pattern of the quark masses .",
    "isospin symmetry in particular holds to a high accuracy .",
    "this is because the scale is set by @xmath1 , where @xmath2 s are current quark masses , while @xmath3 is the chiral symmetry breaking scale around 1 gev .",
    "because of this small hadronic isospin violations , the electromagnetic effect becomes important in order to understand the isospin symmetry breaking  @xcite .",
    "there are many papers suggesting that the electromagnetic effect is dominant in the mass splitting of pions  @xcite .",
    "therefore , to study the isospin symmetry breaking , it is necessary to consider both the hadronic isospin violations and the electromagnetic effect . in this paper",
    ", we study the isospin symmetry breaking of @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) mesons in the qcd sum rule .",
    "this work is an extension of the previous one for the @xmath7 and @xmath8 mesons  @xcite .",
    "one can calculate the hadronic effect due to the different @xmath9 and @xmath10 current - quark masses and condensates . while for the electromagnetic effect , we follow the procedure in ref .",
    "they constructed a gauge invariant electromagnetic two - point function for the heavy - light quark systems .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we derive the qcd sum rules for the @xmath4 and @xmath5 mesons . in section 3",
    ", we discuss our numerical results of their masses , decay constants and differences .",
    "we find that they are consistent with the experimental values .",
    "section 4 is a summary .",
    "for the past decades qcd sum rule has proven to be a powerful and successful non - perturbative method  @xcite . in sum rule analyses ,",
    "we consider two - point correlation functions : @xmath11 where for @xmath4 meson @xmath12 and for the vector @xmath5 meson @xmath13 here these currents may couple to particles @xmath4 and @xmath5 through @xmath14 here @xmath15 is the four momentum carried by the initial meson , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the decay constants of @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively , @xmath18 is the mass of @xmath5 , and @xmath19 is the polarization vector of @xmath5 . in the ope , @xmath20 can be divided into two parts : the hadronic part and the contributions from the electromagnetic effects .",

    "we have assumed the vacuum dominance and factorization for the four quark condensates , for instance  @xcite , @xmath46    the difference determines the isospin symmetry breaking of @xmath4 meson , while the difference determines the isospin symmetry breaking of @xmath5 meson .",
