    "in this article , the problem we address is how to control chaos in hamiltonian systems which are close to integrable .",
    "we consider the class of hamiltonian systems that can be written in the form @xmath0 that is an integrable hamiltonian @xmath1 ( with action - angle variables ) plus a small perturbation @xmath2 .",
    "+ the problem of control in hamiltonian systems is the following one : for the perturbed hamiltonian @xmath3 , the aim is to devise a control term @xmath4 such that the dynamics of the controlled hamiltonian @xmath5 has more regular trajectories ( e.g.  on invariant tori ) or less diffusion than the uncontrolled one . in practice , we do not require that the controlled hamiltonian is integrable since it is a too strong requirement , but only that it has a more regular behavior than the original system .",
    "+ obviously @xmath6 is a solution since the resulting hamiltonian is integrable .",
    "however , it is a useless solution since the control is of the same order as the perturbation . + for practical purposes , the desired control term should be small ( with respect to the perturbation @xmath2 ) , localized in phase space ( meaning that the subset of phase space where @xmath4 is non - zero is finite or small enough ) , or @xmath4 should be of a specific shape ( e.g. a sum of given fourier modes , or with a certain regularity ) .",
    "moreover , the control should be as simple as possible in order to be implemented in experiments .",
    "therefore , the control appears to be a trade - off between the requirement on the reduction of chaos and the requirement on the simplicity of the control .",
    "+   + in this article , we provide an algorithm for finding a control term @xmath4 of order @xmath7 such that @xmath8 is integrable .",
    "this control term is expressed as a series whose terms can be explicitly and easily computed by recursion .",
    "it is shown on an example that truncations and approximations of this control term @xmath4 provides a simple and easy way to control the system .",
    "in this section , we follow the exposition of control theory developed in ref .  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath9 be the algebra of real functions defined on phase space .",
    "for @xmath10 , let @xmath11 be the linear operator acting on @xmath9 such that @xmath12 for any @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the poisson bracket .",
    "the time - evolution of a function @xmath15 following the flow of @xmath16 is given by @xmath17 which is formally solved as @xmath18 if @xmath16 is time independent , and where @xmath19 any element @xmath20 such that @xmath21 , is constant under the flow of @xmath22 , i.e. @xmath23 let us now fix a hamiltonian @xmath24 .",
    "the vector space @xmath25 is the set of constants of motion and it is a sub - algebra of @xmath9 . the operator @xmath26 is not invertible since a derivation has always a non - trivial kernel .",
    "for instance @xmath27 for any @xmath28 such that @xmath29 .",
    "hence we consider a pseudo - inverse of @xmath30 .",
    "we define a linear operator @xmath31 on @xmath9 such that @xmath32 i.e. @xmath33 if the operator @xmath31 exists , it is not unique in general . any other choice @xmath34 satisfies @xmath35 .",
    "+ we define the _ non - resonant _ operator @xmath36 and the _ resonant _ operator @xmath37 as @xmath38 where the operator @xmath39 is the identity in the algebra of linear operators acting on @xmath40 .",
    "we notice that eq.([gamma ] ) becomes @xmath41 which means that the range @xmath42 of the operator @xmath43 is included in @xmath44 .",
    "a consequence is that any element @xmath45 is constant under the flow of @xmath1 , i.e. @xmath46 .",
    "we notice that when @xmath47 and @xmath31 commute , @xmath37 and @xmath36 are projectors , i.e. @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "moreover , in this case we have @xmath50 , i.e.  the constant of motion are the elements @xmath51 where @xmath52 .",
    "+ let us now assume that @xmath1 is integrable with action - angle variables @xmath53 where @xmath54 is an open set of @xmath55 and @xmath56 is the @xmath57-dimensional torus , so that @xmath58 and the poisson bracket @xmath59 between two hamiltonians is @xmath60 the operator @xmath47 acts on @xmath61 given by @xmath62 as @xmath63 where the frequency vector is given by @xmath64 a possible choice of @xmath31 is @xmath65 we notice that this choice of @xmath31 commutes with @xmath47 .",
    "+ for a given @xmath20 , @xmath45 is the resonant part of @xmath61 and @xmath66 is the non - resonant part : @xmath67 where @xmath68 vanishes when proposition @xmath28 is wrong and it is equal to @xmath39 when @xmath28 is true .",
    "+ from these operators defined for the integrable part @xmath1 , we construct a control term for the perturbed hamiltonian @xmath69 where @xmath15 , i.e.  we construct @xmath4 such that @xmath70 is canonically conjugate to @xmath71 .",

    "+ proposition 1 tells that the addition of a well chosen control term @xmath4 makes the hamiltonian canonically conjugate to @xmath81 .    _ proposition 2 : _  the flow of @xmath70 is conjugate to the flow of @xmath82 : @xmath83",
    "the remarkable fact is that the flow of @xmath84 commutes with the one of @xmath1 , since @xmath85 .",

    "remark : _ a similar approach of control has been developed by g. gallavotti in refs .",
    "the idea is to find a control term ( named _ counterterm _ ) only depending on the actions , i.e.  to find @xmath95 such that @xmath96 is integrable . for isochronous systems , that is @xmath97",

    "the explicit expression of @xmath115 is given by @xmath118 the main purpose of the control is to have a control term which is as simple as possible in order to be implemented in the experiment .",
    "+ a possible simplification is to consider the region in between the two primary resonances located around @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "we develop the approximate control term around @xmath121 .",
    "it thus becomes @xmath122 up to a function that only depends on time .",

    "( 10,9)(0,0 ) ( 0,0 ) ( 4.5,5.8 )    we notice that the perturbation has a norm ( defined as the maximum of its amplitude ) of @xmath128 whereas the control term has a norm of @xmath129 for @xmath99 .",
    "the control term is small ( less than 4% ) compared to the perturbation .",
    "+ we can decrease the amplitude of the control term by considering @xmath130 where @xmath131 and still get a lot of kam tori in the vicinity of the region @xmath121 .",
    "for instance , the control is still effective with @xmath132 . using the renormalization - group transformation  @xcite ,",
    "we have looked at the domain of existence of the golden - mean kam torus which is the rotational invariant torus with frequency @xmath133 .",
    "this rotational invariant torus only exists in the domain @xmath134.\\ ] ] therefore , in this domain of @xmath28 there are barriers in phase space that prevent diffusion of trajectories .",
    "the control is optimal for @xmath135 . increasing the amplitude of the control",
    "does not improve the control which means that the control we devised is not `` brute force '' .",
    "this control is robust since it is effective away from its reference value @xmath135 .",
    "there is also the possibility of reducing the control ( by a factor larger than 2 ) and still get a significant effect of the control . + in order to see more precisely the effect of the control term , we have applied laskar s frequency map analysis  @xcite to this model . for initial conditions @xmath136 where @xmath137 and @xmath138 $ ] , we compute the main ( rotational ) frequency @xmath139 of the trajectory integrated from 0 to @xmath140 following laskar s procedure .",
    "figure  [ figfma1 ] depicts the frequency @xmath141 as a function of @xmath117 for hamiltonian  ( [ eqn : fp ] ) with @xmath99 with and without the addition of the approximate control term  ( [ eqn : f2fpa ] ) .",
    "an apparent continuous variation of the frequency is associated with a region with kam tori .",
    "a flat variation is associated with a resonant island .",
    "a scatter of points is associated with a chaotic region .",

    "we have shown on a simple example the explicit construction of a control term . this term can be drastically simplified and still is able to reduce chaos in the system .",
