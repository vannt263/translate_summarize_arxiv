    "synchronized oscillation of active elements can be observed in various fields , including biology , engineering , ecosystem , and chemical systems @xcite . in many cases , synchronization of the entire system",
    "is required for proper functioning under various types of noise and heterogeneity .",
    "important examples include the heart ( a population of cardiac cells ) @xcite , the circadian pacemaker ( a population of clock cells ) @xcite , and power grids @xcite .",
    "oscillators are often connected through a complex network , where heterogeneity in network connectivity may critically hamper synchronization .",
    "such a case is actually observed in a special type of chaotic oscillators . for the synchronization of these chaotic oscillators",
    "@xcite , there exist both lower and upper thresholds of the coupling strength @xcite , and thus , global synchronization tends to fail for heterogeneous networks @xcite .",
    "however , only a few examples of such chaotic oscillators with a similar property are known . moreover , for periodic oscillators , little has been reported about the potential negative effect of network heterogeneity on synchronization .",
    "we have recently investigated a phase oscillator that is unilaterally influenced by a pacemaker and is also under noise @xcite and found nontrivial phase slip in the strong coupling regime ; this implies that synchronization is possible only for intermediate coupling strengths .",
    "it has been shown that this reentrant transition is observed for general interaction functions .",
    "although it is not at all obvious whether dynamical behavior obtained in the phase model with strong coupling is also reproduced in limit - cycle oscillators , it has been demonstrated that the brusselator model , a typical system of limit cycle oscillators , does show the reentrant transition .",
    "such nontrivial phase slip can be another source of instability for a population of network - coupled oscillators , and thus it is important to understand how different networks respond to this new type of instability .    in this study",
    ", we show that heterogeneous networks are more prone to phase slip .",
    "the essence of this behavior can be understood from the phase diagram of two mutually coupled phase oscillators .",
    "mutually coupled oscillators fail to synchronize for too weak and too strong coupling strengths when they are subjected to noise .",
    "because of this property , synchronization is easily violated in heterogeneous networks .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : mutual ] , we investigate a system of two mutually interacting oscillators under noise and compare it with two unilaterally connected oscillators , which have been studied previously ; two main causes of frequency drop , nontrivial phase slip and oscillation death , are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : slip ] and sec .",
    "[ sec : death ] , respectively .",
    "then , in sec .  [ sec : network ] we present the results for network - connected oscillators .",
    "let us first consider two mutually interacting identical phase oscillators subjected to noise .",
    "their dynamics are governed by the following phase equation : @xmath0 where @xmath1 or @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the phase and the natural frequency of the @xmath5-th oscillator , respectively , @xmath6 is the coupling strength , and @xmath7 is gaussian white noise with strength @xmath8 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath9 .",
    "we set @xmath10 without loss of generality .",
    "this model is symmetrical under oscillator exchange , and interaction vanishes when @xmath11 .",
    "the precise form of the interaction is determined by the phase sensitivity function @xmath12 and the stimulus function @xmath13 @xcite , which are both @xmath14-periodic functions .",
    "we specifically choose @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a parameter . throughout this work we assume @xmath17 , which assures that the synchronous state is linearly stable in the absence of noise .",
    "when @xmath18 is small compared to @xmath4 , the averaging approximation is applicable to eq .",
    "@xcite , resulting in @xmath19 which is the sakaguchi - kuramoto coupling function @xcite .",
    "we refer to eq .   as the non - averaged phase model and to the same one with the approximated interaction given by eq .   as the averaged phase model .",
    "note that the averaged phase model is valid as a model of coupled limit - cycle oscillators only for @xmath20 . since we are concerned with both weak and strong coupling strengths we employ the non - averaged phase model in this work .",
    "although considering such non - averaged cases would normally require us to treat multiplicative noise proportional to @xmath12 , here we consider additive noise for simplicity .    in a previous study @xcite",
    "we have investigated a phase oscillator with phase @xmath21 under noise that is unilaterally coupled to a noise - free pacemaker with the same oscillation frequency @xmath4 : @xmath22 where the functions @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the same as in eq .  , and equally @xmath25 is the same gaussian white noise . in this unilateral model",
    ", we found the following reentrant transition : as @xmath18 increases from zero with a fixed value of @xmath8 , the oscillator undergoes the first transition from a noise - driven to a pacemaker - driven synchronous state ; and then , as @xmath18 increases further the oscillator undergoes a second transition , after which phase slip occurs more frequently with increasing @xmath18 .",
    "before the first transition , diffusion causes phase slip , where the effect of noise is stronger than the effect of coupling ; this type of phase slip is trivial and also occurs in the averaged phase model , such as for kuramoto or sakaguchi - kuramoto oscillators .",
    "in contrast , phase slip after the second transition is counter - intuitive in the sense that stronger coupling yields more frequent synchronization failure and that at each slip event the oscillator lags behind the pacemaker ( i.e. , the phase difference @xmath26 decreases by @xmath14 ) .",
    "it has been shown that this nontrivial phase slip is caused by an interplay between noise and nonlinearity and that this occurs only in non - averaged phase models with noise @xcite .",
    "phase slip is also observed in the present model where interaction is mutual .",
    "a phase slip event is counted every time when the phase difference @xmath27 increases or decreases by @xmath14 , and the slip rate is defined as the total number of phase slips divided by the observation time @xmath28 .",
    "figure [ fig : phasediag_mutual ] shows the slip rate as a function of the coupling strength @xmath18 and the noise intensity @xmath8 for three different @xmath16 values .",
    "the phase slip predicted by the averaged model@xcite is observed for all cases where @xmath29 .",
    "in addition to this trivial type of phase slip , reentrant transitions are also observed for a range of @xmath8 when @xmath30 . in particular , for @xmath31 , the second transition line follows a power law with an exponent close to @xmath32 . for @xmath33",
    ", the reentrant transition line has a steeper slope .",
    "also , for large @xmath18 , the phase slip region is invaded by the region of oscillation death .",
    "figure [ fig : death ] plots the mean oscillation frequency of the two oscillators , averaged over observation time @xmath34 , with the average frequency for each oscillator given by @xmath35 .",
    "the black region indicates that oscillation completely stops .",
    "no such oscillation death is observed for @xmath36 . for @xmath37 ,",
    "the reentrant region disappears , although nontrivial phase slip is observed for @xmath38 .",
    "we have numerically confirmed that there are no reentrant regions observed for at least @xmath39 and that the region of nontrivial phase slip diminishes as @xmath16 decreases .",
    "the overall tendency of phase slip for different @xmath16 is similar to our previous result for unilateral coupling [ eq .  ] in that the model shows reentrant transitions and the nontrivial phase slip region expands as @xmath16 increases , although there are differences too . in the case of unilateral coupling , no oscillation death",
    "is observed , which is obvious because of the existence of the pacemaker .",
    "further , the power law exponent , which also appears in the case of unilateral coupling when @xmath31 , is theoretically estimated and numerically confirmed@xcite to be @xmath40 , which is far from the value of @xmath32 observed in fig .  [",
    "fig : phasediag_mutual](b ) .",
    "the difference between the exponents indicates that the mechanism of phase slip differs from the case of unilateral interaction , which is investigated below .     and the noise intensity @xmath8 for @xmath33 , corresponding to fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediag_mutual](c ) .",
    "the dashed vertical line represents @xmath41 [ eq .",
    "let us investigate how phase slip occurs for strong coupling . to do this , we rewrite model in terms of mean phase @xmath42 and phase difference @xmath43 : @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are gaussian white noise with the noise intensity @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "note that the system is @xmath49-periodic in @xmath50 and @xmath14-periodic in @xmath51 .",
    "in the noise - free case , there exists a synchronous solution @xmath52 .",
    "the synchronous state @xmath53 is linearly stable for @xmath6 , with floquer multiplier @xmath54 .",
    "when a sufficiently strong noise is introduced , this synchronous state may be destabilized according to the following scenario : if @xmath18 is large , phase difference @xmath51 is strongly bound to zero for most of the time during the evolution of @xmath50 , but there are instances in which the coupling term for @xmath51 vanishes , namely when @xmath50 is close to @xmath55 and @xmath16 , which means that short time intervals exist in which @xmath51 is driven only by noise . if , during this noise - driven period , the deviation of @xmath51 from the synchronous state @xmath53 becomes large , the second term of eq .   becomes comparable to the first term , leading to @xmath56 .",
    "then , it is likely that @xmath51 continues to be driven by noise with the mean phase velocity kept close to zero , until @xmath51 makes a full revolution .",
    "hence , a necessary condition for nontrivial phase slip is specified from the requirement that @xmath57 has a solution in the noise - free case : since @xmath58 , @xmath57 is possible only if @xmath59 as shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : phasediag_mutual ] is separated by a line @xmath60 , and the region @xmath61 shows the behavior expected from the averaged phase model .    in the case of @xmath31 ,",
    "the following scaling analysis validates the above scenario .",
    "let us first estimate the range of @xmath50 in which the dynamics of @xmath51 are governed only by noise .",
    "below , the phase difference is considered in the range @xmath62 .",
    "suppose that @xmath63 at @xmath64 . in this moment",
    "the coupling term for @xmath51 vanishes .",
    "when @xmath65 is small , dynamics at around @xmath64 are governed at the lowest order of @xmath50 by @xmath66    when @xmath50 is treated as a parameter , the probability distribution of @xmath51 , @xmath67 , is effectively governed by the following fokker - planck equation : @xmath68 a curve in @xmath50-@xmath51 space is defined by equating the drift term and the diffusion term , while replacing the derivative of @xmath51 by @xmath51 itself : @xmath69 note that here and in the subsequent analysis , we only focus on the scaling form , disregarding numerical factors . hence , if @xmath50 satisfies @xmath70 then the effect of the drift term is dominated by the diffusion term for the whole range of @xmath51 .",
    "conversely , if @xmath71 , the drift term becomes effective .",
    "if @xmath50 evolves as @xmath72 , we can determine the critical time @xmath73 at which @xmath50 reaches @xmath74 : @xmath75    now consider a trajectory starting from @xmath76 at @xmath64 .",
    "the typical diffusion length of @xmath51 at @xmath77 is given by @xmath78    moreover , @xmath57 with @xmath79 determines another curve in @xmath50-@xmath51 space : @xmath80 for large @xmath18 , this curve and the other curve given by eq .",

    "indeed , by expanding eqs .   and in terms of @xmath51 , @xmath82 is obtained as @xmath83 which diminishes as @xmath18 increases .",
    "in order that the trajectory reaches the curve before it gets affected by the drift term , the diffusion length @xmath84 must be greater than @xmath82 .",
    "the critical transition line is given by @xmath85 , which yields the scaling form @xmath86 which implies that , for a fixed @xmath8 value , phase slip becomes more and more frequent as @xmath18 increases .",

    "<S> we investigate synchronization in complex networks of noisy phase oscillators . we find that , while too weak a coupling is not sufficient for the whole system to synchronize , too strong a coupling induces a nontrivial type of phase slip among oscillators , resulting in synchronization failure . </S>",
    "<S> thus , an intermediate coupling range for synchronization exists , which becomes narrower when the network is more heterogeneous . </S>",
    "<S> analyses of two noisy oscillators reveal that nontrivial phase slip is a generic phenomenon when noise is present and coupling is strong . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the low synchronizability of heterogeneous networks can be understood as a result of the difference in effective coupling strength among oscillators with different degrees ; oscillators with high degrees tend to undergo phase slip while those with low degrees have weak coupling strengths that are insufficient for synchronization .    </S>",
