    "the analysis of nonlinear systems using experimental circuits is always an active area of research that provides a better understanding on the theoretical concepts .",
    "the fitzhugh - nagumo circuit for neuron model @xcite , the lorenz oscillator based on a climate model @xcite and the popular chua s circuit @xcite are few examples of this kind . in this context",
    ", several studies are made on the development of memristor based circuits , since memristors are commercially not available yet .",
    "for example , the analog integrator based smooth memristor was implemented to study the behaviour of chua s circuit with memristor as nonlinear element @xcite . the time varying resistor based memristor circuit is implemented on electronic circuit simulator to study the occurrence of chaotic beats in a driven chua s circuit @xcite and the nonsmooth bifurcations , transient hyperchaos and hyperchaotic beats in a murali - lakshmanan - chua circuit @xcite .",
    "apart from that , analogue circuits to explore the voltage - current characteristic of the memristor are also reported in the literature @xcite . in all these studies ,",
    "the memristor is separately conceived as a sub - circuit to follow the specific choice of memristive function .",
    "all these sub - circuits are complex and prone to the dynamical deviations from the mathematical modeling due to the tolerance effects of the circuit components and the inherent noise effects .",

    "the figure 1 shows the memristor based chua s circuit . here , @xmath9 is active nonlinear element which comprises the parallel combination of negative conductance ( @xmath10 ) and two terminal passive flux controlled memristor .",
    "the memristor is characterized by smooth continuous cubic monotonic - increasing nonlinearity given by @xcite :    @xmath11    where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are constants which are assumed to be greater than zero . from this expression ,",
    "the memductance @xmath3 can be deduced as    @xmath14    the circuit equation for memristor based chua s circuit can be written using kirchoff s laws as follows @xcite ,    @xmath15    where , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are voltage across the capacitors @xmath20 , @xmath21 , current flowing through the inductor @xmath22 and the flux through the memristor respectively . substituting the functional form @xmath3 in to eq .",
    "3(a ) yields ,    @xmath23    by applying transformation to the variables as @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , then the circuit equations becomes , @xmath33    the dynamics of eq .",
    "( 4 ) is obtained through numerical simulation . throughout our analysis ,",
    "runge - kutta fourth order algorithm is used to solve the equations numerically . for the following specific choice of system parameters in the eq .",
    "( 4 ) , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and initial conditions \\{@xmath39}=\\{@xmath40 } , the chaotic motion is obtained .",
    "figure 2 shows the phase portraits of the system in different projections of @xmath41 and @xmath42 planes .",

    "so the analagoue circuit simulation is the suitable method for this circuit implementation . in the analogue circuitry ,",
    "all variables are converted into voltages .",
    "since the maximum amplitudes of the state variables @xmath44 and @xmath42 are less than @xmath51 , the signals of these variables are more prone to affected by the inherent noise while implementing the circuit . to avoid these limitations , we uniformly upscale the maximum value of all the variables to @xmath52 v. this range is adequate to avoid noise and saturation effects over the op - amps considering a power supply of @xmath53 v. further , it is convenient to visualize the time waveform in the oscilloscope traces as well as to capture the data through data acquisition cards . applying the amplitude scaling to the eq .",
    "4 , the new variables are defined as @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 . rewriting the eq . ( 4 ) to the new variables and dropping the bar over the variables for convenience , yields the following upscaled system ,    @xmath58    considering a probability of any intermediate signal to surpass the saturation voltage limits , the entire system equation is then divided by the largest parameter . in the present case ,",
    "since the greatest parameter is @xmath59 , we divide the entire system by the factor 15 on both sides of the eq .",

    "on the implementation of analogous circuit , it is noticed that the calculated value of the resistances are not fit with the off - the - shelf component values .",
