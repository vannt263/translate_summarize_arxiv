    "this paper represents a second part of our research dedicated to the theory of diffusion of hopping charge carriers biased by electric field in disordered systems with a gaussian energy distribution of the energy of the localized states : @xmath1 here @xmath2 is the spatial concentration of sites available for hopping transport and @xmath3 is the energy scale of their density of states ( dos ) .",
    "the gaussian dos is assumed to apply for disordered organic materials , such as molecularly doped and conjugated polymers and organic glasses.@xcite while in the previous paper @xcite one - dimensional transport was considered , in the current paper we present results for two- and three - dimensional systems .",
    "this study has been on one hand stimulated by numerous experimental studies on organic disordered materials,@xcite which claim the invalidity of the conventional form of the einstein relation between the carrier mobility @xmath4 and the diffusion coefficient @xmath5 @xmath6 on the other hand our study is stimulated by the lack of a concise theory for the diffusion biased by electric field in the hopping transport mode .",
    "it is , however , this transport mode that dominates the electrical conduction in disordered organic materials where transport is due to incoherent tunnelling of electrons and holes between localized states randomly distributed in space , with the dos described by eq .",
    "( [ eq - gaussian - dos]).@xcite the transition rate between an occupied state @xmath7 and an empty state @xmath8 , separated by the distance @xmath9 , is described by the miller - abrahams expression @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the attempt - to - escape frequency .",
    "the energy difference between the sites is @xmath12 where the electric field @xmath13 is assumed to be directed along the @xmath14-direction .",
    "the localization length of the charge carriers in the states contributing to the hopping transport is @xmath15 .",
    "we assume the latter quantity to be independent of energy and we will neglect correlations between the energies of the localized states , following the gaussian - disorder - model of bssler .",
    "@xcite    the field - dependent diffusion in such systems in the 3d case has so far been studied by computer simulations .",
    "richert , pautmeier , and bssler performed monte carlo simulations in 3d and showed that the longitudinal diffusion coefficient @xmath16 is strongly dependent on the electric field and that the dependence is quadratic at such low fields that the mobility of charge carriers remains field - independent.@xcite this is in contrast to the linear field dependence of the diffusion coefficient at low fields obtained by the exact analytical theory and by numerical calculations for 1d systems in the preceding paper.@xcite in order to clarify the nature of the field effect on the diffusion for 3d and 2d systems we suggest in the current paper an analytical theory for the field - dependent diffusion coefficient in the hopping regime for such systems .",
    "this theory confirms the conclusion of richert , pautmeier , and bssler@xcite about the parabolic field dependence of @xmath16 at low fields .",

    ", the simulations for two- and three - dimensional systems were repeated with only nearest - neighbor hopping allowed .",
    "the mobility and diffusion coefficient obtained in this case were somewhat lower than those for the variable range hopping , however the parabolic shape of the field dependence for the diffusion coefficient did not change .",
    "our numerical results can be qualitatively summarized as follows : ( i ) the diffusion coefficient _ along _ the electric field depends parabolically on the field strength @xmath13 at low fields ; ( ii ) the diffusion coefficient _ perpendicular _ to the field is field - independent in the range of fields where ohm s law is fulfilled ; ( iii ) the field - dependent part of the diffusion coefficient rapidly decreases with increasing temperature ; ( iv ) the field - dependent part of the diffusion coefficient is very sensitive to sites which energies are lower than the mean carrier energy .",
    "the discussion above , in particular the latter statement on the decisive role of rare sites with very deep energies that can hardly be found in the finite simulation arrays , raises the task of developing an analytical theory for the diffusion process in the hopping regime enhanced by an electric field .",

    "the only relevant theory is the one developed by rudenko and arkhipov for _ band transport _ in materials with traps.@xcite although this theory predicts a parabolic field dependence of the longitudinal diffusion coefficient , it can not be directly applied to _ hopping transport _ , because it operates with quantities that are specific for band conductivity ( for example , the effective density of states in the conduction band ) .",
    "therefore it is necessary to develop a theory for hopping transport , particularly because monte carlo simulations suffer from finite - size effects as described above .",

    "[ sec - theory ] .",
    "the origin of the field - dependent diffusion can be understood qualitatively with the aid of a spatio - temporal picture of the carrier distribution sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig - sketch ] .",

    "@xmath58 , one may `` project ''",
    "these dots from the starting point to the line @xmath59 .",
    "the direction of `` projecting '' is determined by the drift velocity . when the drift velocity is equal to zero ( no electric field , the left part of fig .",
    "[ fig - sketch ] ) , the spatial distribution of carriers at @xmath59 does not depend on the scatter of times spent by the carriers in order to perform a fixed number of jumps . on the contrary , in the case of drift caused by an electric field ( the right part of fig .",
    "[ fig - sketch ] ) , this scatter in times `` projects '' into the line @xmath59 , which gives rise to the broadening of the spatial distribution at @xmath59 .",
    "this broadening is the reason for the enhancement of the diffusion coefficient due to electric field .",
    "the above consideration shows that fluctuations of the durations of jumps are responsible for the field - induced diffusion .",
    "these fluctuations can be especially pronounced for systems with a broad distribution of site energies , because jumps from energetically deep sites to transport sites demand exponentially long times .",
    "let us start from a general form of the _ quantitative _ description for the field dependence of the diffusion coefficient .",
    "our consideration is based on the assumption that _ successive jumps are statistically independent _ , i.  e.  the diffusion process is markovian .",
    "the latter means that increments in carrier coordinates at a given jump , as well as the time interval from the preceding jump till the given one , do not depend on the carrier prehistory .",
    "this assumption definitely does not hold for the one - dimensional hopping transport considered in the previous paper.@xcite in the 1d case , the probability of returning to an already visited trap is not negligible , and hence the consequent jumps must be correlated . therefore our analytical consideration based on the assumption of the statistical independence of the successive jumps present below can be valid only for 2d and 3d cases since it is reasonable to assume that in the latter cases the carrier trajectories are non - returning .",
    "let @xmath58 be some fixed moment of time ( @xmath58 is large compared to the mean time of a jump ) ; @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 be the carrier s displacements along the axes @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath14 during the time interval @xmath65 $ ] ; @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 be coordinate displacements and a time increment related to only one jump , respectively ; @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 be the displacements after @xmath23 successive jumps .",
    "angle brackets will denote averaging over jumps performed by different carriers , equivalent to the averaging over successive jumps of one carrier .",
    "we start with the simple case of zero electric field . since there is no drift ,",
    "the expectation values of @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 vanish , and one obtains for the diffusion coefficients @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath16 @xmath75 for large @xmath58 , the displacements @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 are approximately equal to @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78  displacements after @xmath2 jumps , where @xmath79 is the mean number of jumps during the time @xmath58 .",
    "consequently , @xmath80 in the limit @xmath81 this approximate equality becomes exact , and one gets @xmath82    let us now consider the case of a finite electric field along the @xmath14-axis .",
    "since the expectation values of @xmath60 and @xmath61 are still zero , all the considerations above remain valid , and eq .  ( [ eq - d_zero_field ] ) remains correct with respect to @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "one can not obtain @xmath16 by literally the same way , because @xmath83 .",
    "instead , one may apply this argumentation to a variable @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the drift velocity . since @xmath86 , one gets @xmath87 and finally @xmath88    since the mean values @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 depend on the electric field , eq .",

    "( [ eq - quadratic - d ] ) where @xmath35 and @xmath34 are field - independent coefficients .",
    "let us first apply our approach to the multiple - trapping ( mt ) model of _ band _ conductivity .",
    "the model includes processes of capture of free carriers by traps , emission of trapped carriers , and free motion ( brownian motion plus drift in the electric field ) of carriers in the band ( fig .",
    "[ fig - multi - trapping ] ) .",
    "the band is characterized by the effective density of states @xmath102 , the mobility @xmath103 and the diffusion coefficient @xmath104 of free carriers .",
    "the traps are characterized by the density of states @xmath105 and the capture rate ( for unit free carrier concentration ) @xmath106 .",
    "the energy @xmath107 is counted from the band edge .",
    "the problem of the field - effect on the diffusion coefficient in the mt model has been considered by rudenko and arkhipov,@xcite who treated the evolution in time of the one - dimensional carrier distribution function . in ref .  , transport was assumed to take place in quasi - equilibrium , i.  e. , the distribution function was assumed to change slowly in comparison with the rate of exchange between traps and the conduction band .",
    "our approach is free of the assumption of quasi - equilibrium transport .",
    "besides , our consideration provides information not only about the longitudinal diffusion coefficient , but also about the transversal one .    instead of examining the carrier distribution function , we will follow the motion of a _ single _ carrier and consider the statistics of this motion .",
    "in order to use the expressions ( [ eq - d_zero_field ] ) and ( [ eq - d_nonzero_field ] ) , we represent the motion of a carrier as a sequence of `` jumps '' , each of them beginning at the moment of escape from a trap .",
    "successive `` jumps '' are statistically independent , because the processes of capture take place in different points in space and there is no correlation between them .",
    "each `` jump '' of a carrier consists of two contributions : free motion and sitting on a trap .",
    "let @xmath108 be the time of free motion ( between emission and capture ) , and @xmath109 be the time of being trapped ( between capture and emission ) ; @xmath108 and @xmath109 are independent random variables .",
    "we denote their expectation values @xmath110 and @xmath111 as @xmath112 and @xmath113 , respectively .",
    "since @xmath112 is the lifetime of free carriers , its reciprocal value is the capture rate : @xmath114 the variable @xmath108 obeys an exponential distribution .",

    "second , we have proven that the equations for @xmath4 and @xmath16 are _ exact _ ( provided that emission / capture probabilities are not influenced by electric field ) , whereas in ref .",

    "now we will apply eq .",
    "( [ eq - d_nonzero_field ] ) to two- and three - dimensional hopping transport in a system with a gaussian dos , in a manner very similar to our consideration of the multiple - trapping conductivity .",
    "our analysis is based on the following hypothesis : _ the field dependence of the diffusion coefficient in 2d and 3d hopping is mainly due to very rare and energetically deep sites .",
    "_ we will call them _ `` traps '' .",
    "_ the traps are rare in two senses : first , the typical distance between the traps is large in comparison to the inhomogeneities of the mobility ; second , the probability of being trapped is small , so that the traps do not affect the carrier mobility .",
    "`` energetically deep '' means that the energies of the traps are far below the mean energy of the carriers",
    ". we will show below that this hypothesis provides a reasonable description of the monte carlo simulation results on the field - dependent diffusion .",
    "as in the previous subsection , we consider the motion of a carrier as a sequence of `` jumps '' , each beginning when the carrier enters a trap , and ending when the carrier enters _ another _ trap .",
    "the durations of different `` jumps '' are not correlated .",
    "the same is true for the carrier displacements .",
    "indeed , the three - dimensional brownian motion is non - returning .",
    "this property guarantees that the carrier always visits a _",
    "trap , and that the trajectories of its motion between different traps do not overlap .",
    "hence there are no reasons for correlations between successive `` jumps '' .",
    "this is the point where dimensionality is important . in one dimension ,",
    "the probability of visiting a previously visited trap is not negligible .",
    "consequently the `` jumps '' must be correlated .",
    "since the `` jumps '' in the 3d case are not correlated , one can obtain the mobility @xmath4 and the diffusion coefficient @xmath5 from the statistics of `` jumps '' using the method of sec .",
    "[ subsec - independent - general ] .",
    "for the 2d case we also use the assumption of independent `` jumps '' .    as in the case of multiple - trapping conductivity ,",
    "each `` jump '' consists of two contributions : `` free '' motion of a carrier and  sitting  on a trap .",
    "let @xmath108 and @xmath109 be the durations of these contributions ; @xmath112 and @xmath113 denoting the mean values @xmath110 and @xmath138 , respectively ( where averaging is over successive `` jumps '' ) ; @xmath103 and @xmath104 be the mobility and the diffusion coefficient of `` free '' motion ( energetically far above the traps ) . with these notations one can follow the same derivation as in the previous subsection and see that eqs .",
    "( [ eq - ra - mu1])([eq - ra - dz1 ] ) are still valid also for hopping transport .",
    "it is convenient to rewrite these equations : @xmath139 where @xmath140 @xmath141 in the regime of ohmic conductivity , the values of @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath142 can be regarded as field - independent because a sufficiently small electric field does not significantly perturb the probabilities of capture and release .",
