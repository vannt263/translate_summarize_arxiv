    "in this article , we have proposed and implemented an interferometric technique that can measure the oam spectrum of a partially coherent field over a wide range of oam eigenstates using just a single - shot acquisition . from the standpoint of practical applicability",
    ", we expect that the high efficiency and ease of implementation of this technique would make it the ideal choice for optical information processing applications that employ oam - spectrum measurements as part of their protocols .",
    "the unparalleleled spectral range of measurement offered by this technique can boost the scalability and performance of such applications . from a fundamental perspective",
    ", this technique can now enable the experimental measurement of oam - entangled two - photon states with very large schmidt dimensionality .",
    "as a result , this technique could lead to major advances in our understanding of high - dimensional oam entanglement in optical fields .",
    "we finally expect that the concept of image - inversion crucially exploited in this technique , can be employed in more general settings to probe correlation properties and spectral characteristics of light fields in other degrees of freedom .",
    "prior to the experiment , the interferometer needs to be characterized by measuring the splitting ratios of the beam - splitters .",
    "after the experiment is set up , we block one arm of the interferometer and measure the total intensity recorded at the output .",
    "we then divide this intensity by the appropriate splittting coefficient to obtain the total intensity of the input field to the interferometer .",
    "the total input intensity will be used to normalize the interferograms recorded using the camera .    in order to obtain an interferogram with high visibility",
    ", the path - length difference can be tuned using the translation stage to be within the temporal coherence length of the input field . in order to ensure that @xmath74 is approximately an even multiple of @xmath75 , we tune the translation stage upto the point where the angular correlation function is oriented upwards with maximum height above the flat pedestal .",
    "after the acquisition of the interferogram , the condition @xmath84 being approximately an odd multiple of @xmath75 can be achieved in either of the two following ways : ( i ) .",
    "starting from the position @xmath77 , introduce a dynamical or geometric phase of @xmath75 manually by means of precise translations or waveplates , or ( ii ) .",
    "if such precise control is not available , then it suffices to select the interferogram with the angular correlation function oriented downwards but with the depth approximately equal in magnitude to the height of the correlation function from the @xmath77 interferogram .",
    "both these methods ensure that @xmath85 and @xmath86 are roughly complementary , i.e , @xmath87 which ensures an almost perfect noise cancellation in the measured spectrum .",
    "note that any error introduced in this procedure will only affect the @xmath82 component of the measured oam spectrum , while the nonzero @xmath1 components differ from the true values only by a common scaling factor .    in order to obtain the azimuthal intensities from the acquired images of the interferograms , we first scale up the images by a factor of eight using a bicubic interpolation method .",
    "this mitigates the discretization errors introduced due to pixelation of the images . in order to evaluate the azimuthal intensity @xmath45 , we position a thin angular cakeslice ( depicted in fig .",
    "( [ setup - schematic]c ) at @xmath23 ) at the angle @xmath7 and evaluate the total number of intensity counts in the region .",
    "the positioning of the cakeslices must be done accurately so that they trace out the transverse beam profile exactly from the center of the beam .",
    "the number of cakeslices required increases as the number of modes in the partially coherent field increases . for our purposes , it sufficed to have about a thousand cakeslices trace the interferogram over the entire azimuthal range .    , l. mandel , e. wolf , cambridge university press ( 1999 ) .",

    "<S> we propose an image inversion - based interferometric technique for measuring the orbital - angular - momentum ( oam ) spectrum of a field that is a symmetric incoherent distribution of oam eigenstates . </S>",
    "<S> the technique directly encodes the angular correlation function of the input field in the azimuthal intensity profile of the output interferogram . </S>",
    "<S> we show that a single - shot acquisition of this interferogram is sufficient to measure the oam spectrum of the input field . </S>",
    "<S> we first present a proof - of - concept experimental demonstration of this technique for laboratory - produced partially coherent fields with known oam spectra . </S>",
    "<S> we then use this technique to measure the intrinsic oam spectrum of the signal - idler field from parametric down - conversion over an unprecedented range of more than 150 modes . to the best of our knowledge </S>",
    "<S> , this technique surpasses all other existing measurement schemes in terms of efficiency , and can have significant implications for high - dimensional optical information processing protocols based on the oam degree of freedom .    an electromagnetic field can be completely specified in terms of the correlations of various orders between the field amplitudes at different spacetime points . </S>",
    "<S> these correlations encode the spectral content of the field and can be experimentally measured through interference effects manifested by the field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the temporal correlation function of a light field can be measured in a mach - zender interferometer as the visibility profile of the fringes as a function of the temporal delay , from which the frequency spectrum of the input field can be obtained by a fourier transform .    </S>",
    "<S> it is known that much like time and frequency , angular position and orbital angular momentum ( oam ) are conjugate physical observables , and consequently the angular position correlation function and the oam spectrum of a light field are also related by a fourier transform @xcite . moreover </S>",
    "<S> , the periodic and continuous character of the angular position variable renders the conjugate oam basis discrete and infinite - dimensional . </S>",
    "<S> this feature makes oam an attractive degree of freedom for both classical and quantum information - based protocols . </S>",
    "<S> classical communication protocols implemented with oam mode division multiplexing have been demonstrated to have high channel capacities and spectral efficiencies @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> quantum communication protocols employing high dimensional quantum states , which can be realized in the oam degree of freedom , surpass quantum protocols that use low - dimensional states in terms of security @xcite and bandwidth @xcite . furthermore , oam - based high - dimensional quantum states can have more efficient gate implementations @xcite in quantum computing schemes , and also possess inherent advantages for fundamental tests of quantum mechanics @xcite .    an important problem relevant to several such oam - based applications </S>",
    "<S> is the measurement of the oam spectrum of a partially coherent field , which in our context is defined to be an incoherent mixture of more than one oam eigenstates . </S>",
    "<S> the commonly used method is to sequentially project the field into its different constituent oam eigenstates using computer generated holograms and measure the corresponding intensities @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another technique is an angular analog of the mach - zender interferometer in which the field is interfered with a rotated copy of itself , and the visibility profile of the resulting fringes with respect to the rotation angle is obtained @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> yet another method involves a young s double slit experiment in which the partially coherent field is incident on an aperture consisting of two angular slits , and the visibility of the corresponding fringes is measured as a function of the angular separation between the slits @xcite . since the visibility profile is simply the normalized angular position correlation function itself , the oam spectrum can be deduced via a fourier transform . while each of the above techniques have their own advantages , they also individually suffer from issues like sensitivity to noise in fiber - coupling efficiencies , unwanted beam precession introduced by rotary elements , incompatibility with low light levels , etc . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , these schemes require a sequence of multiple intensity measurements whose number scales with the oam bandwidth of the partially coherent field .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we present an image inversion - based interferometric technique that can measure the oam spectrum of a partially coherent field in a single - shot measurement . </S>",
    "<S> the setup consists of a balanced mach - zender interferometer with a disparate number of mirrors in the two arms , which has the action of encoding the angular correlation function of the input field in the azimuthal intensity profile at the output port(s ) . </S>",
    "<S> this technique does not involve any dynamical elements or apertures and is perfectly compatible with low light levels . </S>",
    "<S> in what follows , we first present a proof - of - concept experimental demonstration of this scheme for a partially coherent field with a synthesized rectangular spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> thereafter we employ this technique to measure the oam spectrum of the partially coherent signal - idler field produced from collinear type - i parametric down - conversion .        </S>",
    "<S> we begin with an introduction to the eigenstates of the oam operator within the paraxial approximation , namely the laguerre - gauss ( lg ) beams @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the transverse field amplitudes of these eigenstates can be expressed in the polar co - ordinates by the laguerre - gauss functions @xmath0 , which are labelled by an azimuthal index @xmath1 and a radial index @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> these functions have the separable form , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a continuous function of @xmath5 alone . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the intensity profile of the beam given by @xmath6 is independent of the azimuthal angle @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the phase profile , given by @xmath8 , imparts the index @xmath1 with a physical interpretation as the topological winding number of the phase . </S>",
    "<S> it can also be shown that @xmath1 is a measure of the oam of the beam and that each photon in such a beam has an oam of @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> for the phase to be single - valued at all azimuthal angles , @xmath1 is constrained to take on integer values only .    </S>",
    "<S> we now consider a partially coherent field which , by our definition , is an incoherently weighted superposition of more than one @xmath10 eigenmodes . </S>",
    "<S> since our goal is only to measure the marginal distribution of the intensities of the constituent pure @xmath11 modes with respect to the azimuthal index @xmath1 , the radial index @xmath2 is implicitly assumed to be summed over its entire range , and will subsequently be suppressed . if we denote the intensity profile of the partially coherent field by @xmath12 , then </S>",
    "<S> @xmath13 where @xmath14 is defined to be the intensity of the oam mode with index @xmath1 and the eigenfunctions @xmath15 are normalized as , @xmath16 the quantities @xmath14 for all values of @xmath1 , together constitute the oam spectrum of the partially coherent field which we normalize such that @xmath17 .    </S>",
    "<S> the electric field @xmath18 of the constituent pure @xmath11 mode with azimuthal index @xmath1 takes the general form , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a stochastic phase . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting superposition of these constituent modes is incoherent if their relative phases are completely random . in other words , the phases @xmath20 must be completely uncorrelated , i.e , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 denotes an average over infinitely many ensemble realizations of the field .    we now consider the physical situation wherein such a partially coherent field is incident into a mach - zender interferometer with an odd number of mirrors in one arm and an even number of mirrors in the other arm , such as the one depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ setup - schematic]a ) . </S>",
    "<S> inspired by previous studies in interferometry and microscopy @xcite , the effect crucially exploited in this technique is the lateral inversion induced by the mirror on the transverse profile of an incident beam about the axis perpendicular to the plane of incidence . without loss of generality ( see supplementary information ) , we may assume that this inversion axis ( ia ) defines the origin @xmath23 of the azimuthal angle . </S>",
    "<S> the transformation induced by the mirror on the polar co - ordinates is then given by : @xmath24 and @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> this results in the transverse phase profile of a pure @xmath11 mode of index @xmath1 being transformed as @xmath26 , which as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ setup - schematic]b ) effectively amounts to a reversal in the sense of the phase variation . </S>",
    "<S> owing to the disparate number of lateral inversions of the fields in the two arms , the output electric field amplitude @xmath27 for that particular mode takes the form , @xmath28 where we have denoted the path lengths in the two arms as @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively , and @xmath31 is the magnitude of the wavevector of the beam . </S>",
    "<S> the splitting efficiencies of the first and second beam - splitters are @xmath32 and @xmath33 respectively , and we have defined @xmath34 and @xmath35 . for simplicity , we have ignored the phase shifts introduced by reflections at the mirrors and beam - splitters . using equations ( [ elrphigen ] ) and ( [ eprimelrphi ] ) </S>",
    "<S> , it can now be shown that the intensity profile @xmath36 is , @xmath37 where we have defined @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath39 $ ] quantifies the temporal coherence for the propagation delay between the fields in the two arms . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we find the output intensity varies sinusoidally with respect to the azimuthal co - ordinate in a floral pattern with @xmath40 bright fringes , and @xmath40 dark fringes ( as depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ setup - schematic]c ) for @xmath41 ) . </S>",
    "<S> such beams , also referred to as `` petal beams '' , have been studied in a variety of contexts like quantum metrology , optical trapping , etc @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> before we proceed further , we issue a clarification pertaining to the notation to be used henceforth . </S>",
    "<S> if an index or variable is suppressed from the expression @xmath42 , then it will be implicit that it has been summed or integrated over its entire range . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , it is evident from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ iprimelrphi ] ) that the entire dependence on the oam index @xmath1 is in the azimuthal variation of the intensity , while the radial part is simply factored out . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is sufficient to restrict our attention to the radially integrated intensity @xmath43 given by , @xmath44 .    </S>",
    "<S> we now recognize that the azimuthal output intensity profile @xmath45 for the entire partially coherent field as input is simply the incoherent addition of the intensities of the individual interference patterns of each of the constituent pure @xmath11 modes . </S>",
    "<S> it can be shown that the azimuthal profile of the radially integrated output intensity @xmath46 takes the form , @xmath47 interestingly , this expression can be cast in the more illuminating form , @xmath48 where we have defined the angular correlation function @xmath49 of the input field as , @xmath50 as before , @xmath22 denotes an ensemble average over several realizations of the field . </S>",
    "<S> thus , eq . ( [ intcorrfunc ] ) states that the angular correlation function of the input field is directly encoded in the azimuthal intensity profile at the output port . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , the azimuthal output intensity @xmath45 corresponding to the angle @xmath7 directly measures the correlation between the field at angle @xmath7 and the field at angle @xmath51 of the input field . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the function @xmath49 is maximum when @xmath7 and @xmath51 are the same azimuthal angular position , i.e , @xmath52 or @xmath53 . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , the function @xmath54 is encoded in two identical copies , one each centered at the diametrically opposite azimuthal angular positions , @xmath23 and @xmath55 .        </S>",
    "<S> we now note an important consequence of the wiener - khintchine theorem for stationary random processes . using eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ elrphigen ] ) and ( [ wphi1phi2 ] ) it can be shown that , @xmath56    in other words , the angular correlation function of the partially coherent input field is related to its oam spectrum by a fourier relation . </S>",
    "<S> this can be understood by recognizing that a partially coherent field can be thought of as a wide - sense - stationary random process with respect to the azimuthal angle @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it then follows from eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ intcorrfunc ] ) and ( [ corrfunc ] ) that values of @xmath14 can be deduced from the azimuthal intensity @xmath45 using the relation , @xmath57 it may be noted that the spectrum can be deduced for any value of @xmath58 and @xmath59 , except for pathological conditions such as @xmath60 , or @xmath59 taking an odd multiple of @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is evident from the above expressions that the values of @xmath62 and @xmath63 are required in order to carry out the above integration . </S>",
    "<S> now if the field is quasimonochromatic , the parameter @xmath58 can be made close to unity by setting the path length difference @xmath64 to be much smaller than the temporal coherence length . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath65 can be inferred directly from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ iprimephi ] ) as , @xmath66 which in turn yields the value of @xmath63 , but only upto an overall sign . </S>",
    "<S> this latter caveat reveals a noteworthy feature of this interferometer . </S>",
    "<S> notice that under the combined transformation of @xmath67 and @xmath68 , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ iprimephi ] ) and consequently eq .  ( [ invform ] ) </S>",
    "<S> remain unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> intuitively , this may be understood by recognizing that the action of the interferometer on a pure @xmath11 mode with index @xmath1 is identical to the action of the interferometer with its arms interchanged , on a pure @xmath11 mode with index @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> the implication of this feature for the measurement scheme is that in the absence of prior information or an additional measurement that ascertains the sign of @xmath63 , the spectrum @xmath14 can be inferred only upto a parity flip . in other words , a single - shot measurement yields both @xmath14 and @xmath70 as possible spectrums of the partially coherent field . </S>",
    "<S> this feature is not too restrictive because the missing information of @xmath59 can always be obtained from a few additional measurements , whose number does not scale with the oam bandwidth . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately , this is usually unnecessary since most partially coherent fields commonly of interest do not carry an overall oam , i.e , they have a symmetric oam spectrum . for such fields , the above degeneracy of solutions is irrelevant since @xmath71 . in what follows </S>",
    "<S> , we shall focus our attention only on fields with a symmetric spectrum , in which case the term with the sine function in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ invform ] ) can be ignored . </S>",
    "<S> we now present our experimental results for a proof - of - concept demonstration of this measurement scheme .    in the experiment , </S>",
    "<S> a 632-nm wavelength he - ne laser beam was spatially filtered and incident on a spatial light modulator ( slm ) as shown in source fig .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ setup - schematic]a ) . using the method of arrizon _ et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we generated holograms to produce pure @xmath11 modes from @xmath72 to @xmath73 with controllable weightages in the first diffraction order . </S>",
    "<S> the produced @xmath11 beam is incident into the depicted mach - zender interferometer , in which the path - difference phase @xmath59 was adjustable using the translation stage . </S>",
    "<S> the output interferogram at the second beam - splitter is then imaged in a single - shot acquisition using an emccd camera and normalized with respect to the total intensity of the incoming field . </S>",
    "<S> the azimuthal intensity @xmath45 is obtained by evaluating the total number of counts in a thin angular cakeslice placed at the angle @xmath7 and integrated upto a radius slightly greater than the beam radius .    as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ observations]a ) , the output interferograms for the pure @xmath11 modes as input consist of floral interference patterns with @xmath40 petals , where @xmath1 is the oam index of the mode . </S>",
    "<S> the floral patterns for pure @xmath11 modes from @xmath72 to @xmath73 were individually recorded . in order to simulate the interferogram for a partially coherent input field with gaussian and rectangular spectra from @xmath72 to @xmath73 , </S>",
    "<S> all the respective floral patterns are accumulated incoherently by manipulating the phase patterns on the slm to ensure the required weightages . as observed in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ observations]b ) and ( [ observations]c ) , when @xmath74 is nearly equal to an even multiple of @xmath75 , there is a constructive overlap of bright fringes at @xmath23 and @xmath55 for all the floral patterns , resulting in the angular correlation function peaking upwards at @xmath23 and @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast when @xmath76 is nearly equal to an odd multiple of @xmath75 , all the floral patterns destructively overlap on dark fringes at @xmath23 and @xmath55 , causing the angular correlation function to dip downwards .        note from eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ invform ] ) and ( [ cosgamma ] ) that while in principle we can infer the input oam spectrum from the azimuthal intensity profile for any value of @xmath59 , we have focused on the situations of @xmath77 and @xmath78 being close to an even or odd multiple of @xmath75 respectively due to their optimal signal - to - noise ratio . </S>",
    "<S> now it can be shown that the noise for non - zero @xmath1 originating from normalization errors , imprecise knowledge of the parameters @xmath79 and @xmath58 can be practically eliminated by evaluating @xmath80 , which is the average of the spectra inferred from the azimuthal intensities corresponding to @xmath77 and @xmath78 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> it must be noted however that this two - shot averaging procedure does not eliminate the error in the measured value @xmath81 corresponding to @xmath82 unless the additional condition @xmath83 is satisfied ( see supplementary information for more detail ) .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ observations]b ) and ( [ observations]c ) , we depict our measurements for the artificially simulated partially coherent fields with a gaussian and rectangular spectrum respectively . notice that the measured spectrum @xmath80 averaged over the single - shot measurements for @xmath77 and @xmath78 is able to reproduce the input spectrum to a good degree of fidelity . </S>",
    "<S> now note that while our measurement assumes a symmetric input spectrum , the experimentally generated input spectrum is mildly asymmetric . moreover , there are lop - sided aberrations in the generated pure @xmath11 modes , especially for higher values of @xmath1 . as seen in figures ( [ observations]b ) and ( [ observations]c ) , </S>",
    "<S> these imperfections contribute to noise in the measured spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> however since these issues pertain to the fidelity of the simulation of the input field and not to some intrinsic limitations of the technique , the noise in the measurement of a true partially coherent field with a symmetric spectrum is expected to be lower . </S>",
    "<S> we have confirmed this expectation for numerically simulated partially coherent fields , for which the measurements have yielded an almost - perfect match with the input spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we now turn our attention to a naturally generated partially coherent field , namely the signal - idler field produced in parametric downconversion ( pdc ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the process of pdc involves a pump photon which is annihilated via an interaction with a nonlinear crystal to produce a pair of entangled photons , termed as signal and idler @xcite . for experiments restricted to one - photon detection </S>",
    "<S> , it can be shown that by virtue of conservation of oam , the field comprising these photon pairs can be described as an incoherent mixture of oam eigenstates @xcite . in fact , the width of the oam spectrum of this signal - idler field is related to the oam entanglement in the two - photon state @xcite . however in order to gain information about the latter , it is necessary to measure the intrinsic oam spectrum of the entire signal - idler field generated in the process , and not some post - selected portion of it . to the best of our knowledge , this challenge has been met so far by only one experiment , which measured the oam spectrum over a range of about fifty modes from a sequence of coincidence measurements for different configurations of a rotary element @xcite . now note that the single - shot technique of the present study does not inherently involve any post - selection . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the range of the oam spectrum measurement is only limited by the sensor element size of the camera . </S>",
    "<S> we now therefore undertake the task of measuring the intrinsic oam spectrum of the signal - idler field produced from pdc using the single - shot technique .    in our experiment , as depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ setup - schematic ] ) , an ultra - violet ( uv ) continuous - wave pump laser of beam radius 1 mm and gaussian transverse mode profile is incident on a type - i beta barium borate ( bbo ) crystal of 2 mm thickness with conditions met to ensure collinear down - conversion . the generated signal - idler field is separated from the residual pump photons using a dichroic mirror ( dm ) . </S>",
    "<S> thereafter , the field passes through a pair of lenses whose collection angle is much larger than the typical emission cone angle of the downconverted field expected for the setup parameters @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this ensures that no part of the incoming field is post - selected out from the measurement procedure and the resulting interferogram from the entire field is imaged on the emccd camera . </S>",
    "<S> we depict the two representative interferograms corresponding to the two optimal situations of @xmath59 in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ spdcpatterns]a ) and ( [ spdcpatterns]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> we clearly observe the angular correlation function encoded in the azimuthal intensity profiles at @xmath23 and @xmath55 , peaking upwards for @xmath77 and dipping downwards for @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> the average spectrum inferred from these interferograms is depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ spdcpatterns]c ) . </S>",
    "<S> it suggests a nearly - exponential spectrum spanning more than a hundred and fifty oam eigenstates . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to the first ultra - broadband measurement of the intrinsic oam spectrum of the signal - idler field from pdc . </S>"
