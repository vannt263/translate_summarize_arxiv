    "exclusive hadron production in two - photon collisions provides a tool to study a variety of fundamental aspects of qcd and has long been a subject of great interest ( cf .",
    ", e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "recently a new facet of this has been pointed out , namely the physics of the process @xmath6 in the region where @xmath7 is large but @xmath8 small  @xcite .",
    "this process factorizes  @xcite into a perturbatively calculable , short - distance dominated scattering @xmath3 or @xmath9 , and non - perturbative matrix elements measuring the transitions @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "we have called these matrix elements generalized distribution amplitudes ( gdas ) to emphasize their close connection to the distribution amplitudes introduced many years ago in the qcd description of exclusive hard processes  @xcite .",
    "indeed it is instructive to consider @xmath6 as a generalization of the process @xmath12 , where the distribution amplitude of a single pion appears .",
    "the @xmath13@xmath14 transition form factor has been the subject of detailed theoretical studies  @xcite .",
    "the experimental data  @xcite are well reproduced by a description based on qcd factorization and provide one of the best constraints so far on the form of the single - pion distribution amplitude .    from a different point of view",
    "@xmath6 is the crossed channel of virtual compton scattering on a pion .",
    "the kinematical region we consider here is closely related to deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) , which has attracted considerable attention in the context of skewed parton distributions  @xcite .",
    "our reaction can also be seen as the exclusive limit of a hadronization process .",
    "the hadronization of a @xmath15-pair originating from a hard , short - distance process such as a @xmath16 collision is usually formulated in terms of fragmentation functions which describe in a universal way semi - inclusive reactions , specifically the transition from a quark or antiquark to a final - state hadron when one integrates over all final states containing this hadron .",
    "we specialize here to the case where the final state consists of two mesons with specified four - momenta , and nothing else .    like other hadronic matrix elements the gdas are process independent .",
    "it has recently been pointed out  @xcite that they occur in the hard exclusive process @xmath17 , where the pion pair is or is not the decay product of a @xmath18 meson , and that the analysis of that reaction would benefit from the measurement of the two - pion gda in @xmath6 .",
    "all these aspects lead us to consider gdas as a promising new tool for hadronic physics , which may be used to unveil some of the mysteries of hadronization and the confining regime of qcd .",
    "the process @xmath19 is well suited to access these quantities experimentally . in the present paper ,",

    "the quark operator in @xmath120 has only components with isospin @xmath118 or @xmath117 .",
    "hence it is a consequence of the leading twist production mechanism and of isospin invariance that in our process the pion pair is in a state of zero isospin , i.e. , that no component with @xmath119 is produced .",
    "another consequence of isospin invariance is that @xmath121 so that the production amplitudes for neutral and charged pion pairs are equal .",

    "generalized distribution amplitudes acquire a scale dependence in the same way as usual distributions do .",
    "this scale dependence can be computed within perturbative qcd , and there is nothing special with multiparticle states since the scale dependence is a property of the nonlocal product of fields under consideration , rather than one of a particular hadronic matrix element ( see  @xcite for an approach exploiting this feature ) .",

    "the @xmath49-dependence , on the other hand , gives access to the partial waves in which the two pions are produced .",
    "it is sensitive to the phases , which reflect the dynamics of the @xmath252 system and its resonances .",
    "even though one will probably not be able to perform a full extraction of the @xmath252 phase shifts in this way , our process provides constraints on these quantities that are independent of the analyses of elastic @xmath252 scattering .",
    "the presence of higher partial waves would in itself be very interesting , since it gives indirect information on the deviation of @xmath643 from its asymptotic form in @xmath43 .",
    "we have restricted ourselves to the production of pion pairs in this work , but it is clear that many of our results are also valid for other exclusive systems .",
    "the most obvious generalization is to charged or neutral @xmath288 pairs , whose comparison with @xmath252 would allow one to study aspects of flavor @xmath96 breaking in the context of the quark - hadron transition . at even higher values of @xmath8",
    "there is the production of @xmath649 , where extra spin degrees of freedom come in , as in the well - studied case of the parton distributions of the nucleon .",
    "another very similar process is the production of @xmath515 pairs , i.e. , the qed analogue of our reaction . comparing the rates of @xmath514 with our estimate for @xmath650 we find that the bremsstrahlung mechanism prefers pions if @xmath2 is in the vicinity of the @xmath18 mass , reflecting the strong resonance effect in the @xmath252 system . for the production from @xmath65 , on the other hand ,",
    "the cross section is considerably larger in the case of muon pairs .",
    "we remark that this could not be anticipated from a dimensional analysis .",
    "the amplitudes for @xmath651 and for @xmath21 have the same @xmath7-dependence in our kinematical limit , and the two - pion distribution amplitude , which describes that pions are not pointlike but have internal structure , is a dimensionless quantity .",
    "using our model gda to calculate the cross section for @xmath652 , we find encouraging rates for the kinematics and luminosity of @xmath583-factories",
    ". thus there should be enough statistics for detailed studies at these facilities .",
    "our estimates of the effect of cuts also indicate that in the kinematical region interesting in our context , the pions and the tagged lepton are well within the experimental acceptance . for high - energy colliders such as lep , our predictions are less optimistic , at least in the range of @xmath2 below 1  gev which we have studied here , due both to the lesser luminosity and the strong longitudinal boost of the pion system .    in conclusion , we find that the process @xmath21 can offer valuable insight into the interactions between quarks , gluons and hadrons , and that it should well be measurable at existing @xmath5 facilities .",

    "we specify in this appendix our sign convention for the definition of pion states .",
    "the relative sign for @xmath474 and @xmath475 is relevant because it determines the relative sign of the gdas for charged and neutral pion pairs .    in terms of eigenstates @xmath653 of the isospin operators @xmath654 ( @xmath655 )",
    "we define @xmath656 notice that the sign for @xmath657 is opposite to the usual convention for eigenstates of @xmath123 .",
    "this has to be remembered when writing down two - pion states with definite isospin using the clebsch - gordan coefficients .",
    "the convention ( [ state - def ] ) is in line with the customs of field theory , see for instance sect .",
    "12.5 of  @xcite .",
    "if , starting from the real scalar fields associated with @xmath658 and @xmath659 , one constructs the complex scalar field @xmath51 which creates @xmath660 out of the vacuum , then @xmath657 is created by the conjugated field @xmath661 . if one used the opposite sign in defining @xmath657 , which is more natural in the context of isospin , then there would be an extra minus sign between the fields creating @xmath660 and @xmath657 . through the lsz reduction formula this sign would show up in crossing relations . with our definition ( [ state - def ] ) this does not happen , and we have for instance that the spacelike pion form factor @xmath662 with @xmath663 becomes @xmath664 with @xmath665 in the timelike region .",
    "we remark in passing that if one uses the isospin relation ( [ more - isospin ] ) and neglects the contributions from strange and heavy quarks , one has the sum rule @xmath666    the choice ( [ state - def ] ) also leads to a convenient relation for the action of the charge conjugation operator @xmath109 , namely @xmath667 the impossibility to find a sign convention that is natural for both charge conjugation and the isospin algebra is discussed at length in chapt .  5 ,  7 of  @xcite ( where the other sign in defining @xmath657 was chosen ) .",
    "we also remark that the definition ( [ state - def ] ) implies @xmath668 and therefore a relative plus sign between the distribution amplitudes for @xmath474 and @xmath475 .",
    "our definition is the same as the one chosen by polyakov et al . , cf.@xcite , and it was also adopted in  @xcite .",
    "we finally mention that the definition leading to eq .",
    "( 15 ) of  @xcite has the opposite sign for @xmath657 .",
    "as we have shown in sects .",
    "[ neutral - pi ] and [ interference - term ] , the unpolarized @xmath41 cross section contains detailed information on the @xmath65 helicity amplitudes @xmath401 . from eqs .",
    "( [ gamma - gamma ] ) and ( [ inter - coefficients ] ) it is however clear that this information is not sufficient to fully reconstruct the three independent complex amplitudes @xmath377 , @xmath379 and @xmath669 . for completeness",
    "we give in this appendix the expressions of the cross section with longitudinally polarized lepton and photon beams , and discuss what additional information can be obtained from single and double polarization asymmetries .",
    "starting with the @xmath65 contribution , we have @xmath670 where @xmath671 and @xmath672 respectively denote the longitudinal polarization of the lepton and photon beam , ranging from @xmath454 to 1 . together with eq .",
    "( [ gamma - gamma ] ) we see that if both lepton and photon are polarized , one has enough independent terms to reconstruct the real and imaginary parts of the interferences @xmath673 , @xmath674 and @xmath675 .",
    "furthermore , the squared terms @xmath676 and @xmath677 come with a different relative sign in the unpolarized cross section and the double polarization asymmetry .",
    "the bremsstrahlung contribution to the cross section reads @xmath678 notice that it only contributes to the unpolarized cross section and the double polarization asymmetry , but not to single polarization asymmetries .",
    "finally , the interference term can be written as @xmath679\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with coefficients @xmath680 for lepton polarization ,",
    "@xmath681 \\sin\\theta \\nonumber \\\\ & &     + { { \\mathrm{im}}}\\big\\ { f_\\pi^ * a_{0 + } \\big\\ } \\ ,          \\sqrt{2x(1-x)}\\ , 2\\epsilon \\cos\\theta \\nonumber \\\\ & &     - { { \\mathrm{im}}}\\big\\ { f_\\pi^ * a_{-+ } \\big\\ } \\ ,          ( 1-x ) \\sin\\theta \\nonumber \\\\ c^\\gamma_2 & = & { { \\mathrm{im}}}\\big\\ { f_\\pi^ * a_{0 + } \\big\\ } \\ ,          x \\sqrt{\\epsilon(1+\\epsilon ) } \\sin\\theta \\nonumber \\\\ & &     + { { \\mathrm{im}}}\\big\\ { f_\\pi^ * a_{-+ } \\big\\ } \\ ,          \\sqrt{2x(1-x ) } \\sqrt{\\epsilon(1+\\epsilon ) } \\cos\\theta , \\nonumber \\\\   c^\\gamma_3 & = & { { \\mathrm{im}}}\\big\\ { f_\\pi^ * a_{-+ } \\big\\ } \\ ,          x \\epsilon \\sin\\theta\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for photon polarization , and @xmath682 if both lepton and photon are polarized .",
    "we see that with polarized photons one can extract @xmath683 , @xmath684 and @xmath685 , which together with the unpolarized interference term makes it possible to reconstruct all three complex @xmath65 amplitudes for values of @xmath2 where the pion form factor @xmath301 is known .",
    "one can not achieve the same with a polarized lepton beam alone , since there are only two terms in the @xmath51-dependence . in this case one can still use the suppression by @xmath353 of the second term in @xmath686 in order to approximately extract @xmath683 .",
    "finally , the double polarization asymmetry gives access to the same quantities one can already obtain in the unpolarized case .",
