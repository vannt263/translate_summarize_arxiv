    "aging phenomena , namely the gradual change of physical properties with time , are observed in almost all ferroelectrics .",
    "@xcite in some acceptor doped barium titanate ( @xmath0 ) and lead zirconate titanate ( pzt ) ceramics aging goes along with an increasing shift of the hysteresis along the axis of the electrical field giving rise to an internal bias field .",
    "@xcite in the past , several plausible models have been developed to intepret the occurence of bias fields and aging phenomena in ferrocelectrics in terms of domain splitting @xcite , space - charge formation , @xcite electronic charge trapping , @xcite , ionic drift @xcite and reorientation of defect dipoles .",
    "@xcite    in acceptor ( `` hard '' ) doped ferroelectrics transition metals usually substitute the @xmath1-site ( ti or zr in pzt ) and tend to bind strongly to oxygen vacancies .",
    "these acceptor center - oxygen vacancy associates form electric and elastic defect dipoles such as charged @xmath2-@xmath3 or @xmath4-@xmath5 , @xcite which contribute to the overall polarization in a ferroelectric compound @xcite and can be aligned either parallel , anti - parallel , or perpendicular to the polarization of the surrounding material as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : confs ] .    in the parelectric state ,",
    "defect dipoles of different orientation are energetically equivalent , whereas they have a preferred orientation in a polar matrix .",
    "arlt and neumann @xcite have attributed the occurence of internal bias fields to the switching of defect dipoles and described the transient orientation of dipoles by a kinetic model . as quantitative data on the energy landscape for these defect dipoles was unavailable at the time they relied on a very simple electrostatic estimate of the energy difference .",
    "the energetic asymmetry between the parallel and anti - parallel dipoles obtained in this fashion for batio@xmath6 was about 30mev and thus much smaller than the energy differences calculated more recently by first - principles methods for pbtio@xmath6 , @xcite which revealed that the energetic asymmetry is actually as large as the barriers for oxygen migration .",
    "only recently , marton and elssser @xcite showed that in fe - doped lead titanate the barrier for reorientation sensitively depends on the position of the migrating oxygen vacancy with respect to the iron atom and the surrounding spontaneous ferroelectric polarization . during fast field cycling ,",
    "the defect - dipoles are expected not to change orientation , because the characteristic rate for oxygen jumps around the acceptor center should be lower than the domain switching process .",
    "experimentally , zhang _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite followed the dynamics of @xmath7-@xmath8 dipoles in barium titanate by electron paramagnetic resonance studies and found support for the so - called `` defect symmetry principle '' , which assumes that non - switching defect dipoles impose a restoring force for reversible domain switching .",
    "@xcite jakes _ et al .",
    "_ could show that in @xmath9 doped pzt defect dipoles are not preferentially located at domain walls but within the domains .",
    "@xcite morozov _ et .",
    "al . _ studied aging - deaging process in hard pzt ceramics using the harmonic analysis of polarization response under switching conditions and concluded that two or more mechanisms are responsible for domain stabilization .",
    "@xcite activation energies of about 0.6ev were attributed to short - range charge hopping , which could be due to local reorientation of microdipoles .",
    "since the switching dynamics of defect dipoles depends on the electric and thermal energy provided to change polarization direction , the contribution of dipole reorientation can only be reliably assessed if realistic numbers for the migration and association energies are available , which allow to quantitatively model the switching dynamics of defect dipoles in a comprehensive way .",
    "the objective of the present work is to develop a kinetic model that captures the formation of defect dipoles as well as their reorientation both in the absence and presence of electric fields . ) , within our model the results for non - oscillating ( dc ) fields are virtually identical to the situation without any external field . ]",
    "cu and fe - doped lead titanate are considered as representative examples and the energy landscape for oxygen vacancy migration in these materials is obtained using first - principles calculations .",
    "we consider both free oxygen vacancies and oxygen vacancies associated with fe or cu .",
    "starting from a statistical distribution the majority of oxygen vacancies is initially unbound . over time vacancies",
    "are captured by impurity atoms and subsequently converted into the lowest energy configuration , which corresponds to a defect dipole that is aligned parallel to the macroscopic polarization ( @xmath10 in fig .",
    "[ fig : confs ] ) .",
    "while the exact time scales for these processes are dependent on dopant type , concentration , and temperature our results demonstrate that the ground state is reached within seconds at temperature slightly above room temperature and thus that already the pistine material can be considered as `` aged '' . in the presence of an oscillating external field",
    "our model predicts that a gradual reorientation of defect dipoles leads to a dynamic equilibrium , in which the parallel and anti - parallel configurations occur with equal probability .",

    "we have therefore resorted to numerical solvers that approach eq .",

    "it should be noted that the model does not take into account the possibility of two or more oxygen vacancies associating with the same impurity atom .",

    "requires knowledge of the energy differences between various vacancy configurations as well as migration energies . to provide these parameters ,",

    "the calculated band gap of 1.47ev is considerably smaller than the experimental value , but consistent with the well known band gap error of dft . as argued in ref .",
    "the band gap error is , however , expected to have a minor effect in the context of migration barrier calculations .",

    "this complexity can in principle be captured by increasing the dimensionality of the probability and rate matrices , @xmath76 and @xmath77 . in the present more simple description ,",
    "we , however , consider already oxygen vacancies in the second impurity neighbor shell as `` free '' .    for completing the rate matrix , we then assume the migration barriers for jumps _ between free _ oxygen vacancies to hold for jumps _ to complexed _ vacancies as well ( values marked in green in fig .",

    "figure  [ fig : cu_dc](a ) shows that even for a temperature as low as 300k the redistribution between these two types of vacancies , _ i.e. _ the installation of the ( partial ) equilibrium over the subset of unbound vacancies , takes place within fractions of a second .    _",
    "( ii ) _ during the second stage ( @xmath86 at @xmath85 ) unbound @xmath54-type vacancies dominate .",
    "concurrently , dopants begin to capture vacancies .",
    "the dynamic equilibrium at this point is such that @xmath87 complexes dominate over @xmath88 and @xmath89 dipoles .",

    "( iv ) _ eventually , the system reaches equilibrium ( @xmath95 at @xmath85 ) , _ i.e. _ virtually all vacancies occupy the lowest energy site.(a ) ) , since it is determined by the boltzmann factor @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the energy difference between the ground state configuration , @xmath98 , and the configuration in question . ]",
    "we can now discuss the ependence of vacancy migration on temperature and dopant concentration .",

    "[ fig : chartimes](b ) the temperature dependence of these characteristic times can be fit to an arrhenius equation , , using the migration barrier between the states involved as the activation energy .",
    "this analysis also demonstrates that the effect of changing the dopant concentration is small and is only visible for the transition between vacancy types @xmath62 and @xmath82 .",
    "already at temperatures @xmath99 the full equilibrium is established within less than a second . since during growth these temperatures are easily reached , the vacancy distribution in tetragonal lead titanate should be in thermal equilibrium , _ i.e. _ virtually all dopants are complexed with vacancies in the ground state configuration , in which the defect dipoles are aligned with the domain polarization .      in the present model",
    "the perturbation introduced by an external electric field enters in two ways .",

    "typical electric fields used for poling ferroelectric ceramics are on the order of 25kv / cm ; the local electric field can , however , be larger than this value due to inhomogeneities .",
    "@xcite assuming a value of @xmath106 and choosing @xmath102}=1\\,\\text{\\aa}$ ] , we obtain an upper limit for @xmath107 of 0.01ev .",
    "obviously the `` direct '' effect of the electric field is rather small compared to the energy difference between different vacancy types and pertains to charged vacancies only .",
    "this implies that with regard to vacancy redistribution a material in a constant external field will behave almost identical to the situation without electric fields .",
    "the situation does , however , change if we consider an oscillating external field .",
    "the field induced reversal of the polarization has a much larger effect on the energetics of the system than the direct contribution since reorientation of the polarization implies that the ( average ) displacement of @xmath1-site atoms is reversed , thus transforming -  into -  complexes . in the present model ,",
    "this is equivalent to exchanging rows 1 and 2 of the migration rate matrix , @xmath71 .",
    "one can therefore include the effect of an oscillating electric field by ( _ i _ ) periodically modifying the barriers for out - of - plane jumps by @xmath107 and ( _ ii _ ) simultaneously exchanging the barriers for jumps involving -  or - .",
    "figure  [ fig : efield_equilibration ] illustrates the temporal evolution of the concentrations of -  and -  vacancies in the presence of an oscillating electric field .",
    "the plot shows that under prolonged cycling a dynamic balance between the two configurations -  and -  is established .",
    "the time after which this balance is obtained depends sensitively on temperature e.g. , at room temperature it is reached after about @xmath108 ( approximately two weeks ) while at 340k it requires only about one hour .",
    "the dynamic balance between -  and -  occurs because the characteristic time required to reach full equilibrium in the absence of external electric fields [ see fig .  [ fig : chartimes](b ) ] exceeds the cycling period . in a fast switching field",
    "the restoring force of the spontaneous polarization is changing signs on a short time scale . as a result , a mean - field composed of parallel and anti - parallel polarization of the matrix is acting on the dipoles , which evantually populate both orientations along the c - axis .",
    "this dynamic equilibrium is sensitive to temperature and the assumption of a static distribution of defect dipoles in a fast switching field should be taken with care .",
    "the results show that by applying a bipolar electric field defect dipoles are redistributed and on average the clamping effect on domain walls is reduced .",
    "this is in line with recent results on deaging of doped pzt.@xcite          [ fig : chartimes_fe ]    complexes of fe with oxygen vacancies act as donors leading to electron chemical potentials in the upper half of the band gap .",
    "the most stable charge state is @xmath109 .",
    "@xcite under such conditions the binding energy is @xmath81 from which one can construct an energy surface shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy_surface_cu](b ) .    the temporal evolution of different vacancy configurations in the absence of an external electric field is shown in fig .  [ fig : fe_dc](a ) which allows us to infer the temperature dependence of the characteristic time scales summarized in fig .",

    "[ fig : cu_dc ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : fe_dc ] we find that the results for fe and cu - doped lead titanate are very similar .",

    "[ sect : landscape ] ) are determined by the migration barriers in the pure host . with regard to the third transition between @xmath112 and @xmath113",
    "the situation is different as the effective barrier in fe - doped material is 1.00ev and thus slightly smaller than in cu - doped lead titanate ( 1.06ev , compare fig .  [",
    "fig : barriers ] ) , which speeds up the transition .",
    "we can thus expect that in the presence of an oscillating external field the dynamic equilibrium between @xmath114 and @xmath115 is established faster as well , which is confirmed by explicit calculation . whereas for cu - doped lead titanate our model calculations predict the equilibrium to be installed over two weeks at room temperature , in fe - doped material the same process should occur on the order of a day .",
    "similarly at 340k equilibration should take only on the order of tens of minutes .",
    "we have parametrized a kinetic model for defect dipole formation and switching by taking data from first - principles calculations for fe and cu - doped @xmath116 .",

    "bipolar poling leads to a dynamic equilibrium between defect dipoles that are aligned parallel and anti - parallel to the lattice polarization , respectively , and thus can be seen as one major contribution to deaging of pzt ceramics .",
    "this is in accord with the experimental observation of deaging by the application of ac fields .",
    "@xcite in cu - doped lead titanate the dynamic equilibration takes about two weeks at 300 k , but is massively accelerated if temperature is slightly increased .",
    "this points to the importance of closely monitoring the sample temperature during testing and studying aging and deaging processes .    for the -  complex , which for both cu and fe is the ground state configuration , the local polarization is parallel to the polarization of the surrounding matrix .",
    "@xcite since in contrast -  defects are aligned anti - parallel to the lattice polarization , an increase in their concentration causes an overall loss of switchable polarization .",
    "this direct contribution should scale linearly with the number of impurity atoms in the sample but due to the small magnitude of the defect dipole moment will amount to a rather small contribution on the macroscopic scale .",
    "defect dipoles , however , also interact with domain walls and can affect their mobility . in lead titanate and tetragonal pzt one typically observes 90@xmath117  domain wall configurations , which is schematically indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : compound ] .",
    "it has been shown by first - principles calculations that the head - to - tail domain wall configuration shown e.g. , in fig .",
    "[ fig : compound ] , is energetically more stable than head - to - head or tail - to - tail configurations . @xcite in the pristine material after cooling ( middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : compound ] ) all defect dipoles are aligned with the lattice polarization and thus follow the head - to - tail pattern .",
    "this situation changes significantly after cyclic loading ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : compound ] ) since now half of the defect dipoles oppose the lattice polarization and thus create local high - energy head - to - head and tail - to - tail configurations .",
    "recent simulations of domain wall motion using an empirical force field @xcite have provided impressive evidence that domain wall motion proceeds via a nucleation - and - growth process",
    ". it will be subject of future work to determine the role of defect dipoles quantitatively but already at the present stage one can imagine that defect dipoles that are aligned anti - parallel to the lattice polarization in the growing domain will locally impede both nucleation and growth while the opposite can be said for defect dipoles that are aligned parallel to the lattice polarization .",
    "one can expect that even though the direct contribution of defect dipoles to the macroscopic polarization is small they can have a significant indirect impact by pinning domain walls and reducing their mobility .",
    "it should be stressed that the fact that domain motion occurs via nucleation and growth is crucial in this context since it implies that domain wall motion occurs locally and can thus be strongly influenced by localized defect dipoles .",
    "in the present work we have derived a kinetic model that allows us to study the temporal evolution of the concentration of different types of vacancies both in the absence and presence of electric fields . the most important input parameter is the energy landscape for oxygen vacancy migration . using parameters for cu and fe - doped  obtained from density functional theory calculations",
    ", we found that the equilibration of the vacancy distribution occurs readily at temperatures considerably below the curie temperature . as a result in the as - synthesized material virtually",
    "all impurity atoms are associated with vacancies forming -  complexes .",
    "the complete realignment of vacancy - metal impurity dipoles parallel to the spontaneous polarization occurs on time scales of hours to days at room temperature , but is massively accelerated if temperature is slightly increased .",
    "this provides evidence for the fact that aging due to defect dipoles occurs instantaneously in pbtio@xmath6-based ferroelectrics .    in the presence of an oscillating electric field a dynamic balance between -  and",
    "-  is established .",
    "prolonged cycling therefore leads to the accumulation of defect dipoles that oppose the polarization of the encompassing domain .",
    "while these defect dipoles directly reduce the switchable polarization , more importantly they can impede domain wall motion , which has been recently shown to proceed via nucleation and growth . @xcite    the present results provide valuable insights into the switching kinetics of defect dipoles in ferroelectrics , which is relevant for understanding aging and deaging mechanisms .",
    "the rate equation approach can be adapated straightforwardly to describe more complex geometries and systems .",
    "this could be used to model the lattice geometries of e.g. , bifeo@xmath6 or lamno@xmath6 .",
    "kinetic models similar to the one discussed in the present paper can also be used to interpret experimental measurements . to this end",
    ", one could employ probes which are sensitive to the orientation of the defect dipoles ( e.g. , electron spin resonance @xcite ) and measure the intensity of the signal before , during and after cycling or heat treatments .",

    "we can employ the calculated migration barriers to derive the diffusivity of oxygen vacancies ( see e.g. , ref .  ) .",
    "the rate at which a vacancy jumps along a given path @xmath11 is @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the attempt frequency , @xmath120 is the barrier which has to be surpassed along path @xmath11 , and @xmath121 . summing over all paths and including the jump lengths @xmath122 as well as the path multiplicities @xmath123 the defect diffusivity",

    "there are again four possibilities each for jumps with components along @xmath129 $ ] and @xmath130 $ ] , respectively , associated with displacements @xmath131 and @xmath132 . inserting these parameters into eq .",

    "finally , the isotropic diffusivity is given as the trace of the diffusivity tensor which for tetragonal symmetry yields @xmath135 .    according to table  [ tab : migration_vo ] the process @xmath136 $ ] has the lowest barrier for all charge states ( also compare the barriers between the four leftmost minima in fig .

    "it should be noted that the experiments in ref .   were carried out at low temperatures on samples that contained an extrinsic concentration of oxygen vacancies . as a result ,",
    "the calculated and measured pre - factors can not be directly compared since the latter contains the ( unknown ) concentration of extrinsic vacancies in the samples .",
