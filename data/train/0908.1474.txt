    "<S> we propose a generalization of the bfm where we relax this constraint and allow the overlap of monomers subject to a finite energy penalty @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this is done to vary systematically the dimensionless compressibility @xmath1 of the solution in order to investigate the influence of density fluctuations in dense polymer melts on various static properties at constant overall monomer density . </S>",
    "<S> the compressibility is obtained directly from the low - wavevector limit of the static structure factor . </S>",
    "<S> we consider , e.g. , the intrachain bond - bond correlation function , @xmath2 , of two bonds separated by @xmath3 monomers along the chain . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the excluded volume interactions are never fully screened for very long chains . if distances smaller than the thermal blob size are probed ( @xmath4 ) the chains are swollen according to the classical fixman expansion where , e.g. , @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , the polymers behave on larger distances ( @xmath6 ) like swollen chains of incompressible blobs with @xmath7 . </S>"
