    "however , the hard photon index at lat frequencies and the evidence for reverse shock emission in early optical data can not rule out the possibilities of synchrotron self - compton emission at lat frequencies @xcite and the klein - nishina suppression of high energy electrons at early times @xcite . such processes would require theoretical modeling which is beyond the scope of this paper .",

    "the apparently steeper temporal decay of the early optical data can be explained in terms of reverse shock emission based on the estimated value of the early peak time provided by the reverse shock emission model @xcite .",
    "these inferred parameters are also in agreement with the very early onset of the afterglow seen at lat frequencies @xcite . the temporal and spectral decay nature at optical - ir frequencies at later epochs favor synchrotron forward shock model although temporal decay at xrt frequencies requires a steeper electron energy index than the deduced value of @xmath70 = 1.8@xmath230.2 solely from the xrt spectral index and @xmath65 between optical and xrt frequencies .",
    "the radio afterglow data constrains self - absorption frequency @xmath80 which is lower than the observed radio frequencies at the sed epoch .",
    "the lat and xrt data of grb 090902b share similar spectral slopes at early epochs and indicate towards their common origin under the synchrotron forward shock model for the radiative fireballs . also , the present analysis can not rule out the possible non - synchrotron origin for the emission at lat frequencies .",
    "the estimated value of @xmath104 along with the required amount of host extinction is consistent with a massive star origin for the burst .",

    "more lat - detected grbs , especially seen by the bat as well , and their early follow - up observations using ground - based robotic telescopes will shed light on the temporal properties of the afterglows and their possible correlation with the observed gev emission . finally , the most tantalizing aspect of these observations is the realization that a great deal more could be learned if accurate lat localizations could be made available more promptly .    this research has made use of the data obtained through the high energy astrophysics science archive research center online service , provided by the nasa / goddard space flight center .",

    "<S> the optical - infrared afterglow of the lat - detected long duration burst , grb 090902b , has been observed by several instruments . </S>",
    "<S> the earliest detection by rotse - iiia occurred 80 minutes after detection by the gbm instrument onboard the _ fermi _ gamma - ray space telescope , revealing a bright afterglow and a decay slope suggestive of a reverse shock origin . </S>",
    "<S> subsequent optical - ir observations followed the light curve for 6.5 days . </S>",
    "<S> the temporal and spectral behavior at optical - infrared frequencies is consistent with synchrotron fireball model predictions ; the cooling break lies between optical and xrt frequencies @xmath0 1.9 days after the burst . </S>",
    "<S> the inferred electron energy index is @xmath1 , which would however imply an x - ray decay slope flatter than observed . </S>",
    "<S> the xrt and lat data have similar spectral indices and the observed steeper value of the lat temporal index is marginally consistent with the predicted temporal decay in the radiative regime of the forward shock model . </S>",
    "<S> absence of a jet break during the first 6 days implies a collimation - corrected @xmath2-ray energy @xmath3 ergs , one of the highest ever seen in a long - duration grbs . </S>",
    "<S> more events combining gev photon emission with multi - wavelength observations will be required to constrain the nature of the central engine powering these energetic explosions and to explore the correlations between energetic quanta and afterglow emission . </S>"
