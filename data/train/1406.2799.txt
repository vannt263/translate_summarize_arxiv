    "the theoretical understanding of transport properties of interacting quantum many - body systems is paramount in characterizing states of matter .",
    "strongly interacting one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems may exhibit either diffusive or ballistic transport properties at finite temperatures @xcite , the latter being due to local conservation laws in integrable models @xcite .",
    "these unusual properties have been speculated to be related to the huge magnetic thermal conductivities observed in 1d quantum magnets @xcite and may have potential applications in signal propagation in artificial 1d systems on surfaces @xcite or for spintronics applications @xcite .",
    "generic non - integrable 1d systems are believed to exhibit no ballistic dynamics @xcite and presumably diffusive transport ( see refs . for possible exceptions or corrections beyond diffusion ) .",
    "recent experimental studies on 1d quantum magnets have set out to elucidate spin diffusion using @xmath1sr and nmr @xcite .",
    "more recently , it has become possible to address qualitative aspects of mass transport in experiments with ultra - cold quantum gases in optical lattices @xcite , based on the realization of bose- and fermi - hubbard models in these systems @xcite .",
    "sudden expansion experiments , using the release of a trapped gas of atoms into an empty and homogeneous optical lattice , suggest that mass transport in two - dimensional hubbard models is diffusive for both bosons and fermions @xcite .",
    "bosons in 1d subject to infinitely strong interactions , called hard - core bosons , however , are integrable via the exact mapping to non - interacting fermions @xcite and the results of @xcite establish an unambiguous experimental realization of ballistic dynamics in an integrable 1d system , rendering this a suitable starting point for future studies .",
    "moreover , hard - core bosons are equivalent to spin-@xmath0 xx models @xcite , thus providing a connection to research on the transport properties of quantum magnets .",
    "an important question concerns the effect of integrability breaking on transport properties . in quantum gas experiments ,",
    "a straightforward way to break integrability is to induce an inter - chain coupling and indeed , experimental results for sudden expansions in the 1d-2d crossover of interacting bosons indicate a rapid emergence of diffusive - like behavior upon increasing the inter - chain coupling @xcite .    as an alternative to the dimensional crossover , one can consider two coupled chains , i.e. , a ladder , which can easily be realized in optical lattices using superlattices @xcite .",
    "the ladder is accessible to state - of - the - art numerical methods , while for two - dimensional systems , there are no reliable approaches .",
    "first studies of the dynamics of hard - core bosons on a ladder geometry in the sudden expansion @xcite or for wave - packet dynamics @xcite indicate diffusive dynamics for sufficiently large inter - chain coupling , yet a rigorous analysis of ballistic and diffusive contributions based on linear response theory is lacking .    in this work ,",
    "we address precisely this question using the spin-@xmath0 xx ladder . by exploiting the concept of dynamical quantum typicality @xcite , we are able to study ladders with up to @xmath2 spins , going beyond the range of exact diagonalization . in addition",
    ", we can reach the long time scales required to analyze ballistic contributions @xcite . in the high - temperature limit ,",
    "we first demonstrate the absence of ballistic contributions and we show that the model realizes standard diffusive dynamics , i.e. , there is a single relaxation time .",
    "we further compute the diffusion constant as a function of the inter - chain coupling and , as another main result , we identify three regimes characterized by qualitatively different time - dependencies of current autocorrelation functions .",
    "finally , we discuss a possible experiment with quantum gases that could put our theoretical predictions to a test .",
    "the plan of this paper is the following : in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we introduce the hamiltonian and define the quantities of interest , namely , the spin - current autocorrelation function , the drude weight , and the diffusion constant . in sec .",
    "[ sec : method ] , we briefly discuss the numerical method , which is based on the concept of dynamical typicality . section [ sec : results ] contains our main results for the time dependence of the spin - current autocorrelation , the finite - size scaling of the ballistic contribution , and the diffusion constant .",
    "we also discuss our results in the context of recent quantum - gas experiments with interacting bosons in optical lattices and make a proposal for a future experiment designed to observe our predictions .",
    "our conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we study spin - current dynamics in an xx ladder of length @xmath3 with periodic boundary conditions , where @xmath4 is the number of sites .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath5 consists of a leg part @xmath6 and rung part @xmath7 , given by ( @xmath8 ) @xmath9 where @xmath10 are spin-1/2 operators at site @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the antiferromagnetic exchange coupling constant along the legs , and @xmath13 is the strength of the rung coupling .",
    "while the xx ladder splits into two integrable xx chains of free jordan - wigner fermions for @xmath14 , it simplifies to a set of uncoupled dimers for @xmath15 . in the case of @xmath16 ,",
    "the xx ladder is non - integrable and the jordan - wigner transformation maps hard - core bosons to interacting fermions @xcite . in general , the model in eq.([model ] ) preserves the total magnetization @xmath17 and is invariant under translations with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we take into account the full hilbert space with @xmath18 states and focus on the case for which @xmath19 , see sec.[sec : tempmag ] .",
    "the longitudinal spin current is defined via the continuity equation and has the form @xmath20 @xmath21 holds only at @xmath22 . within linear response theory ,",
    "we are interested in the current autocorrelation function at inverse temperatures @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) , @xmath25 where the time argument of @xmath26 has to be understood w.r.t .  the heisenberg picture , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 in the limit @xmath29 .",
    "from this autocorrelation we obtain the two central quantities @xmath30 with @xmath31 and @xmath32 . the first quantity @xmath33 is the spin drude weight , which , being the non - decaying part of @xmath34 , signals ballistic transport @xcite . the second quantity @xmath35 is the spin - diffusion constant , well - defined for a vanishing @xmath33 [ and a sufficiently fast decay of @xmath34 ]",
    "the prefactor @xmath37 is the static susceptibility ( per spin ) and @xmath38 as @xmath29 .",
    "the numerical calculation of the two quantities in eq.([quantities ] ) is feasible by choosing finite but sufficiently long times @xmath39 and @xmath40 , where @xmath34 has already decayed to its final value , and @xmath41 .",

    "( [ exact ] ) by a scalar product involving a single pure state @xmath43 .",
    "more precisely , following the concept of quantum typicality , we draw @xmath43 at random according to a probability distribution that is invariant under all possible unitary transformations in hilbert space ( haar measure ) . using a so - constructed @xmath43 and abbreviating @xmath44 , the autocorrelation function in eq .",
    "( [ exact ] ) is approximated by @xcite @xmath45 the approximation becoming more accurate as the dimension of the hilbert space increases  @xcite .",
    "the salient feature of eq .",
    "( [ approximative ] ) is that it can be calculated numerically without diagonalization of the hamiltonian . to this end",
    "one has to introduce two pure states : the first reads @xmath46 and the second is @xmath47 .",
    "then , @xmath48 the dependence of the two states on @xmath49 and @xmath50 is calculated numerically by a massively parallel implementation of a suzuki - trotter product formula or chebyshev polynomial algorithm .",
    "this allows us to study quantum systems with as many as @xmath51 spins [ hilbert - space dimension @xmath52 , although we do not exploit symmetries of eqs .",

    "what is more , the exponent turns out to be practically independent of @xmath91 while the amplitude scales roughly as @xmath92 . based on these results ,",
    "we conclude that , for @xmath93 , the drude weight vanishes in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "compared to earlier studies of transport in gapped 1d spin systems @xcite , we resolve a particularly clean exponential and fast decay of the drude weight .      since the drude weight vanishes , the central quantity of interest is the diffusion constant .",
