    "the inorganic liquid crystal ( lc ) state of v@xmath0o@xmath1 was discovered by zcher @xcite in 1925 , the detailed historical review of the studies of mesophases in v@xmath0o@xmath1h@xmath0o system was found in @xcite .",
    "a number of experimental investigations was devoted to clarification of structure and physicochemical properties of aqueous v@xmath0o@xmath1 mesophases with optical , x - ray and nmr spectroscopy @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this knowledge acquires more relevance , as far as areas of the realization of vanadium oxides are expanding with the synthesis of nanostructures , the manufacturing of cathodes in lithium batteries or counter - electrodes in electrochromic devices , antistatic coating in the photographic industry , conducting matrix in glucose biosensors @xcite , @xcite and so on .    because of anisotropic ( spindle - like ) form of droplets ( tactoids , how zcher named them ) , aqueous @xmath2 sols form nematic phase @xcite , @xcite .",
    "sizes of a tactoid particle depend on ageing time due to the type of ageing processes due to which they are carrying out ( e.g. ageing in the biltz sol , or in the mller sol , either in the prandtl and hess sol ) .",
    "for example , their average length was found to be 0.4 @xmath3 m after one year of ageing @xcite .",
    "a reversible sol - gel transition is observed for a vanadium concentration corresponding to v@xmath0o@xmath1,250h@xmath0o ( where number 250 means @xmath4 in formula v@xmath0o@xmath1,@xmath4h@xmath0o ; [ v]@xmath5 0.2 mol / l=18 mass @xmath6 ) @xcite , @xcite . the sol phase lies approximately between 250 and 400 @xmath4 , and @xmath4=400 - 600 corresponds to the biphasic region , whereas the region of @xmath7600 has occupied by isotropic sols at the phase diagram of v@xmath0o@xmath1,@xmath4h@xmath0o @xcite .",
    "the attractiveness of pas methods to study the droplet coalescence in v@xmath0o@xmath1h@xmath0o sols is motivated by significant troubles of their direct registration with optical spectroscopy and x - ray diffraction .    in lifetime pas of the aqueous v@xmath0o@xmath1 sols ,",
    "both water and tactoid collisions with the positron beam are measurable .",
    "the ps formation in water is more or less interpreted ( @xcite ) . whereas the sol phase of vanadium pentoxide is puzzle in this meaning .",
    "there is a stimulated example of the hydration of v@xmath0o@xmath1 powders in cao - zro@xmath0-sio@xmath0 glasses , where lifetime positron annihilation data revealed changes in magnetic properties of the whole system caused by influence of v@xmath8 , v@xmath9 , and v@xmath10 paramagnetic ions @xcite represented in the same mole fraction as that in aqueous sols .",
    "the basic data , received or with the doppler broadening , either with angular correlation technique @xcite , exhibited the role of @xmath11-electrons of transition metals ( including vanadium ) , their average value of the annihilation rate @xmath12 ( for any transition metals ) is taken to be 1.5 ns@xmath13 .",
    "also there are developed the theoretical modeling for predictions of positronium spectra , which are based on ( @xcite and references therein ) calculations of electron states concerning to the measuring variation characteristics of ps , carrying out due to _ ab initio _ or molecular dynamics ( md ) principles .",
    "however , important analytical methods for iono - covalent oxides @xcite contain in the models which include the electronegativity and the acidity scales supplied with the classification of partial negative charges @xcite .",
    "positron annihilation studies of v@xmath0o@xmath1h@xmath0o sols , especially during a regime of the coalescence of droplets , may helpfully specify their physicochemical and structure properties .",
    "analyzing the facts on condensation processes at the chemical synthesis of vanadium pentoxide polymers ( see [ 21 ] in @xcite ) , and on an orientation of tactoid particles ( figure 1 ) in a magnetic field , one may suppose , that they bear some negative charge , as well as single v@xmath0o@xmath1 molecules @xcite , @xmath50.2e@xmath14 per v@xmath0o@xmath1 ; in the first case , a charge arises from the acid dissociation of v@xmath8oh groups .",
    "in addition , such a charge has been overall explained by the theories of binary oxides @xcite .",
    "there will be shown effects of the ps formation under a positron irradiation of v@xmath0o@xmath1h@xmath0o sols straight away after a magnetic field effect ( the magnetic splitting of ps levels will not be taken into account ) .",
    "consider an example of positron and muon studies of water - dioxane mixtures @xcite , which revealed the dependence of the @xmath15-ps formation on the component rate .",
    "this means that there are three regions of relative concentrations @xmath16 of water in dioxane ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) .",
    "first region corresponds to the presence of water clusters forming by hydrogen bonds , which are able to trap electrons , in such a cluster , at excess of electrons , a hydrated electron may appear .",
    "negative charged water clusters ( h@xmath0o)@xmath20 , @xmath72 allow ps to exist in dioxane phase and retain constant its lifetime . at @xmath18 , at the water - dioxane phase segregation , giant water globules @xcite , @xcite ( @xmath21 ) allow ps to depart to the dioxane phase . eventually , regimes of the ps formation differ with clusterization corresponding to different concentrations .",
    "this analogy serves to identification of two types of ordering in the sol phase of v@xmath0o@xmath1h@xmath0o , interacting with the positron beam .",
    "mass of the v@xmath0o@xmath1 molecule is in order large than of the water molecule .",
    "v@xmath0o@xmath1 molecules are joint into nematic tactoids , and water have to be globular at @xmath22 similarity to the aqueous dioxane aggregation in frames of the representation @xcite .",
    "the texture of tactoid phase in a vanadium pentoxide - water system with the concentration of v@xmath0o@xmath1 of 1.1@xmath6 by mass .",
    "the cell thickness is 200@xmath3 m , @xcite . ]",
    "the result of e@xmath23 interactions with water is well - known @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "ps forms due to the sequence of reactions , the initial of which proceed @xmath2410@xmath25 s and produce the next active forms : h@xmath26o@xmath23 , hydrated electron e@xmath27 and oh group .",
    "the second stage ( @xmath28 10@xmath29 s ) contains a creation of molecular products and a trapping of initial products .",
    "ps lifetimes of pure water are @xmath30=0.12 ns , @xmath31=0.40 ns , and @xmath32=1.80 ns @xcite .",
    "evaluations received from @xcite and @xcite define averaged interatomic distances @xmath11 and the respective molecular size the ( 010 ) layer configuration , @xmath33=1.89@xmath34 @xcite ( @xmath35 @xcite ) and o  v  o angles , 86.18@xmath36 , for all bridging oxygen centers .",
    "terminal vanadyl oxygen centers are assumed directly on top of vanadium centers in the direction normal to the ( 010 ) layer with @xmath33=1.58@xmath34 .",
    "this results in local vo@xmath1 pyramids with square base and fourfold rotation symmetry in addition to the inversion , twofold rotation , and mirror symmetries of the ( 010 ) layers .",
    "this configuration is similar to the ribbon structure @xcite , where each ribbon is made of two v@xmath0o@xmath1 planes at a distance of 2.8@xmath34 . roughly speaking , colloid particles",
    "are made of ribbon - like polymeric particles about 0.5 @xmath3 m in length and 20 nm wide @xcite .",
    "accept that their charge is set by the bjerrum length , then it equals 2.040816 e@xmath14 .",
    "then let a tactoid contains approximately10 polimeric ribbons .",
    "thermodynamics of nematic tactoids should be balanced under electrostatic , van der waals and excluded volume interactions .",
    "the excluded volume concept means the onsager theory of the lc order parameter , widely applicable for nematics .",
    "the monte carlo ( mc ) simulations for lc tactoids were developed @xcite , @xcite in respect to the statistical analysis of the order parameter behavior , taking into account a bipolar shape of nematic inorganic droplets and their surface energy causing their formation . in the lattice - gas humphries - luckhurst - romano model @xcite ,",
    "molecules of the inner region of a droplet tend to be aligned with the major axis of the droplet as the system is cooled below a tricritical point , verging towards one of the equilibrium states .",
    "the correspondence to the polymer ribbon configuration in semiconducting v@xmath0o@xmath1 molecules and possibility of tactoids to keep the inter plane distance ( 2.8@xmath34 ) allow us to apply a number of approaches to calculate spectra of sols .    applying the model of fluid - filled pores @xcite , @xcite as the self - annihilation rate @xmath37 and pick - off annihilation rates from fluid @xmath38 and pore walls @xmath39 , we can consider the summary annihilation rate as @xmath40 here @xmath41 @xmath42 is the positron(/electron ) density at the direction @xmath43 of a tactoid sphere ( though here we mean bipolar geometry of a tactoid @xcite , see below ) , in our case @xmath44=2.8@xmath34 .",
    "@xmath45 dr^3.\\ ] ]    for the fluid component we need to apply standard numerical methods ( e.g. @xcite and so on ) . in the exact calculations",
    ", one may take into account only e@xmath23 density , whereas electrons in v@xmath0o@xmath1 ribbons were counted out in a manner of @xcite .    in the approach independent on the initial positron energy , we rest at the important geometrical properties of tactoids , such as their bispherical geometry leading to polarity and nontriviality in the definition of @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "namely , @xmath39 is not proportional to the fourth degree of @xmath47 , as it follows from ( 2 ) .",
    "the coalescence of the v@xmath0o@xmath1 s tactoids was observed by kaznacheev @xcite in the absent of a magnetic field . in the sol region of v@xmath0o@xmath48h@xmath0o , where @xmath4=250 - 800 , the interparticle distance equals to 400 - 800@xmath34 @xcite .",
    "whiles volume of two bonded tactoids will be increased in two times , the @xmath32 ps lifetime should decrease in eight times .",
    "besides of this , estimations of ps lifetimes of some glasses doped with v@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite shows that depending on the mole v@xmath0o@xmath1 content , in vicinity of 1 mol @xmath6 , lifetime slopes and remains constant at the increase of pentoxide fraction in the glass , positrons bond with non - bridging oxyden changing v@xmath8 ions onto paramagnetic v@xmath9 and v@xmath10 .",
    "so , the mechanism of the ps @xmath49-@xmath50 conversion may be considered to explain a positronium states .",
    "from the above presentation , we may conclude , that apart from the consideration of cooperative effects in water leading to clusterization of negative charges , the coalescence of sol particles of aqueous v2o5 is the effect of a decrease of @xmath32 ortho - ps lifetime achieved regards to condensation of a giant negative charge in bulk tactoids .",
    "it is a further measurable effect .",
