    "a break - up of nuclei into many fragments ( multifragmentation ) has been observed in nearly all types of nuclear reactions when a large amount of energy is deposited in nuclei .",
    "it includes reactions induced by protons , pions , antiprotons , and by heavy ions of both , relativistic energies ( peripheral collisions ) and fermi-energies ( central collisions ) . according to the present understanding ,",
    "multifragmentation is a relatively fast process , with a characteristic time around 100 fm / c , where , nevertheless , a high degree of equilibration is reached .",
    "the process is mainly associated with abundant production of intermediate mass fragments ( imfs , with charges @xmath0 3 - 20 ) . however , at the onset of multifragmentation , also heavy residues are produced which have previously only been associated with compound - nucleus processes . at very high excitation energies ,",
    "the imf production gives way to the total vaporization of nuclei into nucleons and very light clusters .",
    "the previous aladin experiments have provided extensive information about multifragmentation of projectiles in peripheral nucleus - nucleus collisions at high energy @xcite .",
    "they have demonstrated a rise - and - fall of multifragmentation with excitation energy , and they have shown that the temperature remains nearly constant , around @xmath15 mev , during this process",
    "there are large fluctuations of the fragment multiplicity and of the size of the largest fragment in the transition region from a compound - like decay to full multifragmentation of spectators @xcite .",
    "it was found that the statistical models , which assume a thermal equilibration among hot fragments in a freeze - out volume at subnuclear densities , are fully consistent with the data @xcite .",
    "we believe that multifragmentation studies pursue two main purposes .",
    "the first one is connected with the general understanding and better description of this reaction which represents as much as 10 - 15@xmath2 of the total cross section in high energy hadron - nucleus collisions , and nearly twice more in nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "secondly , the multifragmentation reaction can be considered as an experimental tool to study the properties of hot fragments and the phase diagram of nuclear matter at densities @xmath3 and temperatures around @xmath4 38 mev which are expected to be reached in the freeze - out volume ( @xmath5  @xmath6 is the normal nuclear density ) .",
    "multifragmentation opens a unique possibility to investigate this part of the phase diagram and to determine the `` in - medium '' modifications of nuclei there .",
    "this second point is very important for many astrophysical applications , in particular , for processes during the supernova ii explosions and neutron star formation @xcite .",
    "some of the properties of hot fragments have been addressed in our previous work .",
    "for example , the symmetry energy was extracted in ref .",
    "@xcite , and it was demonstrated that it decreases considerably with excitation energy . in this paper",
    "we show that also the surface energy of hot fragments can be investigated in these reactions , and that the modified surface energy can be extracted by comparing theory with experiment .",
    "statistical models are used in situations when an equilibrated source can be defined in the nuclear reaction .",
    "the most famous example of such a source is the compound nucleus introduced by niels bohr in 1936 .",
    "the standard compound nucleus picture is valid only at low excitation energies when sequential evaporation of light particles and fission are the dominating decay channels .",
    "however , this concept can not be directly applied at high excitation energies , @xmath7 23 mev / nucleon , when the nucleus rapidly disintegrates into many fragments . as was shown in many experiments ( see e.g. @xcite ) , an equilibrated source can be formed in this case too , and statistical models are generally very successful in describing the fragment production .    as a basis for our study below",
    "we take the statistical multifragmentation model ( smm ) , for a review see ref .",
    "the model assumes nuclear statistical equilibrium at a low - density freeze - out stage .",
    "it considers all break - up channels composed of nucleons and excited fragments taking into account the conservation of baryon number , electric charge and total energy .",
    "light clusters with mass number a @xmath8 are treated as elementary particles with only translational degrees of freedom ( `` nuclear gas '' ) .",
    "fragments with a @xmath9 are treated as heated liquid drops . in this way one may study the nuclear liquid - gas coexistence in the freeze - out volume .",
    "the coulomb interaction of fragments is described within the wigner - seitz approximation .",
    "different decay channels @xmath10 are generated by monte carlo sampling according to their statistical weights , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the entropy of channel @xmath10 . after the break - up",
    ", the coulomb acceleration and the secondary de - excitation of primary hot fragments are taken into account .",
    "the smm has been already successfully applied for the analysis of aladin data @xcite .",
    "in the smm , the symmetry energy of hot fragments with mass number @xmath13 and charge @xmath14 is parametrized as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is a phenomenological parameter . in the case of cold nuclei",
    "@xmath17  mev is adopted in order to describe their binding energies . for hot fragments",
    "this parameter can be modified and , therefore , should be extracted from experimental data .",
    "the corresponding set of isospin - related data may be provided by the multifragmentation reactions , e.g. , via the isoscaling phenomenon @xcite . at present , there are evidences for a significant reduction of the symmetry energy in hot nuclei @xcite .",
    "the influence of the symmetry energy on the characteristics of produced fragments was already partly analyzed in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that it has a small effect on average quantities such as the temperature and fragment masses , but it influences mainly the isotope distributions of the fragments .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .  1 for the mean charge distributions and neutron - to - proton ( @xmath18 ) ratios of fragments .",
    "these characteristics change only slightly even with rather large variations of @xmath16 . in this respect ,",
    "we believe that variations of @xmath16 will not influence the results of previous analyses of experimental data related to the fragment charge partitions and average isotope yields @xcite .        by contrast",
    ", the symmetry energy has a large effect on isotope distributions . as evident from fig .",
    "2 , they become wider at small @xmath16 @xcite . the subsequent deexcitation of the produced hot fragments",
    "changes the distributions in two ways : their widths usually become narrower and their centroids are shifted toward symmetry @xcite . this effect has to be taken into account when comparing with experimental data ; it is essential , e.g. , for the isoscaling analysis @xcite .    in the following , we study possible modifications of the fragment surface energy employing different isospin compositions of the sources . within the smm",
    "this issue can be separated from modifications of the symmetry energy because the latter does not significantly change the mean charge yields .",
    "in phenomenological mass formulae , isospin dependent terms for the surface energy are sometimes introduced in order to obtain a better description of the ground - state masses of nuclei @xcite .",
    "however , some modern mass formulae can provide even better descriptions of the nuclear masses retaining only the bulk isospin term but with a special treatment of the shell effects @xcite .",
    "we believe that the best strategy for the present purpose of investigating new in - medium properties of nuclear fragments is to consider a minimum number of parameters which have a clear physical meaning .",
    "we , therefore , use the standard smm liquid - drop parametrization which contains no surface isospin term . instead we allow for the surface coefficient to be a free parameter which is determined by comparing the calculations with experimental data obtained for multifragmentation of nuclei with different isospin content .",
    "the surface free energy of hot fragments in the smm is parametrized as @xmath19 , where @xmath20^{5/4}$ ] . here",
    "@xmath2118 mev is the surface coefficient for isolated cold nuclei , as adopted in the weizsaecker mass formula , and @xmath22 18 mev is the critical temperature for the nuclear liquid - gas phase transition in infinite matter .",
    "one should distinguish @xmath23 from the phase transition temperature in finite hot nuclei , which is essentially lower , around 56 mev @xcite .",
    "@xmath23 should be considered as a model parameter characterizing the temperature dependence of the surface tension in finite nuclei . at low temperatures",
    "this @xmath24-dependence leads to a correct surface contribution to the level densities of nuclei , i.e. , it describes correctly the heat capacities of isolated nuclei .",
    "the surface parameters may also be modified in the low - density nuclear medium , i.e. , in environments consisting of nucleons and hot fragments . the possible changes of @xmath23 in multifragmentation reactions were analyzed in refs .",
    "@xcite , and from the analysis of experimental data it was found that @xmath22  1720 mev in reactions with au nuclei .",
    "the @xmath23 effect on fragment yields is rather small and , in any case , it is included in the surface energy . in the present work we concentrate on the influence of the @xmath25 coefficient on the multifragmentation pattern .",
    "the surface energy is rather important , since production of new fragments means increasing the surface contribution to the total energy of the system .",
    "therefore , even small variations of the surface energy lead to big changes of fragment mass and charge distributions .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .  3 for different excitation energies of au sources with a freeze - out density @xmath26 .",
    "decreasing the surface energy favors the disintegration already at low excitation energies while a larger @xmath25 suppresses the multifragmentation channels .        to characterize the charge distributions we use the @xmath27 fit of the fragment yields . in order to avoid contributions of other processes",
    "leading , e.g. , to fission - like large fragments ( @xmath28 ) and to coalescence - like small clusters ( @xmath29 ) , we limit the fragment charges by the range @xmath30 in this fit . the extracted @xmath31 parameters for three sources with different isospin , @xmath32u , @xmath33au and @xmath34xe , are shown in fig .",
    "4 . in these calculations ,",
    "the surface coefficient was fixed at the standard value of @xmath35  mev .",
    "one can see that the isospin effect is rather essential , as was already discussed in @xcite .",
    "we choose the au source to demonstrate possible effects of the modified surface energy on multifragmentation .",
    "figure  5 shows the influence of the coefficient @xmath25 on the caloric curve , on the mass number @xmath36 of the largest fragment , and on @xmath31 . we should point out that thermodynamical characteristics of the system in the freeze - out volume can also be influenced by the modifications of the surface energy of fragments .",
    "when these hot fragments leave the freeze - out volume and decay , their normal properties are restored . in order to emphasize the difference between isolated nuclei and nuclei in the medium , we introduce two different temperatures .",
    "one is an effective temperature , @xmath37 , which is found from the energy balance in the freeze - out volume by assuming that the properties of fragments are the same as those of isolated nuclei .",
    "this effective temperature reflects internal excitations of fragments respective to their ground states and , thus , it can be compared to the temperature reached in the compound nucleus at the same excitation .",
    "another temperature is the freeze - out temperature @xmath24 which includes in - medium modifications of the fragment properties , i.e. , different @xmath25 . the evolution of both temperatures with @xmath38 is presented in fig .  5 in the top two panels .",
    "one can see that variations in @xmath25 lead to noticeable effects . with a small @xmath25 , correlated with a smaller effective temperature ,",
    "the system disintegrates into lighter fragments , and @xmath36 becomes smaller too . at low excitations",
    "the effective and freeze - out temperatures exhibit a similar behavior .",
    "however , at very high excitation energies when the system disintegrates only into light imfs , the freeze - out temperature becomes higher at smaller @xmath25 .",
    "this behavior has a simple explanation : the smaller surface term leads to a smaller level density parameter for internal excitation of fragments , which requires higher freeze - out temperatures in order to achieve the energy balance .",
    "the @xmath31 parameter exhibits a general trend in the evolution of the charge distributions , it depends strongly on the excitation energy for all considered values of the surface coefficient ( fig .  5 , lower panel ) .",
    "the change in the disintegration process can be conveniently characterized by @xmath39 , i.e. the minimum value which @xmath31 assumes as a function of the excitation energy .",
    "the region near @xmath39 corresponds to the transition from channels with one big residual fragment to multifragmentation into several small fragments . in the nuclear matter",
    "this transition is usually associated with the coexistence region of the liquid - gas phase transition . both , @xmath39 and the corresponding effective temperature @xmath40 , vary as a function of the surface energy , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "as one can see , the three considered sources with different isospin content exhibit similar trends but the @xmath39 for the neutron - rich sources is higher .",
    "in order to extract information about the surface energy in multifragmentation we compare the calculations with experimental data . the aladin collaboration has performed exclusive measurements of multifragmentation events for projectile - like sources with different isospins @xcite and has made these data available .",
    "measurements have been made with @xmath32u , @xmath33au , and @xmath34xe projectiles at the laboratory energy of 600 mev per nucleon , interacting with different targets ranging from be to u. the power law parameters @xmath31 , obtained from fits to the charge distributions in the range @xmath41 , are shown in fig .",
    "7 as a function of the bound charge @xmath42 ( the total charge accumulated in fragments with @xmath43 ) divided by the projectile charge @xmath44 .",
    "small @xmath42 values correspond to high excitation energies of the sources which disintegrate predominantly into very light clusters ( `` fall '' of multifragmentation ) .",
    "large values of @xmath42 correspond to low excitation energies , at which the decay changes its character from evaporation / fission like processes to multifragmentation ( `` rise '' of multifragmentation ) .",
    "the chosen target has no influence on the extracted @xmath31 parameter , as demonstrated in the bottom part of fig .  7 for the case of the au and u projectiles .",
    "this is consistent with the target invariance generally observed for the charge correlations of projectile fragmentation @xcite .",
    "these invariance properties extend also to projectiles with different @xmath44 if the data are scaled accordingly .",
    "for example , the imf multiplicities divided by @xmath44 ( the reduced multiplicities ) are practically identical if plotted as a function of the reduced bound charge @xmath45 .",
    "this has been shown in @xcite for the case of u , au and xe projectiles with the same data sets as used here .",
    "the same holds for the @xmath31 parameters which , however , exhibit some variations at small and large @xmath42 ( fig .  7 ,",
    "differences at small @xmath42 may occur for several reasons .",
    "the uncertainty of determining @xmath42 for highly fragmented partitions , arising from the finite acceptance of the spectrometer for he and li fragments @xcite , may be slightly system dependent which , in principle , could be taken into account by using an experimental filter . restricting @xmath42 to small values",
    "will , furthermore , generate constraints for the accepted partitions which affect the resulting @xmath14 distributions @xcite .",
    "the fitting within a fixed @xmath14 interval while scaling @xmath42 could thus possibly lead to systematic deviations in @xmath31 for different projectiles which , however , are small as evident from the data .    at large @xmath42 ,",
    "the observed differences are slightly larger and more systematic , and no experimental constraints of this type exist .",
    "the detection efficiency of the aladin spectrometer is , furthermore , very high for @xmath46 , essentially 4@xmath47 in the projectile frame , and the experimental trigger was adapted for the fragmentation channels @xcite . in the following , we will",
    ", therefore , concentrate on the analysis of the observed differences in the behavior of @xmath31 for sources with different isospin at the `` rise '' of multifragmentation ( @xmath48 ) . because of the large acceptance of the detector ,",
    "the theoretical predictions will be directly compared to the data without the use of an experimental filter .",
    "in the most general consideration the fragmentation process can be subdivided into several stages as follows .",
    "( 1 ) a dynamical stage leading to the formation of equilibrated nuclear systems , ( 2 ) disassembly of the system into individual primary fragments , and ( 3 ) deexcitation of hot primary fragments . even though the first stage may be described by a dynamical model , such as the intranuclear cascade model , it is more practical to determine an ensemble of equilibrated sources , produced after the nonequilibrium stage , by direct comparison with experimental data @xcite . in the following , we consider the ensembles of equilibrated sources extracted in refs .",
    "@xcite for the au projectiles , which provide a very good description of the aladin data .",
    "we use also the same version of the smm code described fully in @xcite . as was found in ref .",
    "@xcite , the average masses of equilibrated sources @xmath49 may be parametrized as @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the excitation energy of the sources in mev , and @xmath52 is the projectile mass . here is @xmath53=0.001 mev@xmath54 , and @xmath550.0090.015 mev@xmath56 is slightly depending on the projectile energy .",
    "it should be noted that the adopted correlation of the mass number with the excitation energy is consistent with dynamical simulations @xcite , as well as with results of other statistical models @xcite . besides providing a very good description of fragment production at different @xmath42 , the calculations with this kind of ensemble reproduce also correctly the behavior of the caloric curve @xcite .",
    "our present analysis is moderately sensitive to the relation between @xmath49 and @xmath51 because we extract @xmath31 in different @xmath45 bins , which are correlated with the excitation energy ( per nucleon ) of the source .",
    "possible variations of the relative weights of the sources in the ensembles have practically no effect on the @xmath31 observable , as was confirmed by performing calculations with different weights .",
    "the typical relative yields of sources used for the case of @xmath33au projectiles are shown in fig .",
    "8 as a function of their mass and excitation energy .",
    "the parameter @xmath57=0.012 was used in this case . the same relation between masses and excitation energies",
    "is also taken for the other projectiles .",
    "it is assumed that the @xmath18 ratio of all sources in the ensemble is the same as in the projectiles .",
    "the dynamical calculations show that this is a quite reasonable assumption for sources with moderate excitation energies",
    ". a very small decrease of the @xmath18 ratio is predicted only for the sources with very high excitation energy @xcite .",
    "this should not qualitatively influence the present analysis in the region of the multifragmentation rise .",
    "the smm calculations with these ensembles for different projectiles predict a scaling of the fragment multiplicities , as well as other observables , in agreement with the experimental data @xcite .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "9 , where we plot the reduced imf multiplicities versus @xmath45 . in order to demonstrate the sensitivity of this correlation to the ensemble parameters and to the surface energy , we compare calculations obtained with different parameter sets . for @xmath33au",
    "we show results for the ensemble parameters @xmath57=0.011 ( full squares ) and @xmath57=0.012 ( empty squares ) , obtained with the surface term @xmath25=18 mev . for @xmath32u",
    "we compare the cases @xmath25=17 mev ( empty triangles ) and @xmath25=18 mev ( full triangles ) for ensembles generated with @xmath57=0.011 and , for the ensembles representing the fragmentation of @xmath34xe , generated with @xmath57=0.012 , we show the results for @xmath25=19 mev ( full circles ) and @xmath25=20 mev ( empty circles ) . in this way",
    "we cover the range of parameters representative for the following analysis of the data .",
    "one can clearly see a very good scaling behaviour , similar to the experimental one demonstrated in fig .",
    "a good description of the imf multiplicities allows us to adjust the ensemble parameters and start the @xmath31 analysis .",
    "this analysis allows us to extract more detailed information on the multifragmentation process , since the @xmath31 fit in the range @xmath14=515 represents a new sensitive observable .",
    "it is important to mention that the maximum imf production is reached at @xmath38 around 56 mev / nucleon , when the sizes of the sources are relatively large ( fig .  8) .",
    "the results of the smm calculations for ensembles of the sources with @xmath57=0.012 produced with xe , au , and u projectiles are shown in fig .  10 . in the case of",
    "au , the obtained @xmath31 parameters are close to the experimental values .",
    "this remains also valid in the region of the multifragmentation `` fall '' , i.e. at high excitation energies and small @xmath42 , even though the sources become small and have very large size variations ( fig .",
    "however , in the region of the multifragmentation `` rise '' the theory gives larger @xmath31 for the neutron ",
    "rich u projectile than for the neutron ",
    "poor xe projectile .",
    "this is opposite to the experimental observation .",
    "below we investigate possible modifications of the smm which can explain this discrepancy .",
    "first , we have tested whether one can improve the agreement with the experiment by simply using mass formulae with an explicit isospin dependence of the surface energy .",
    "we have implemented the myers - swiatecki mass formula @xcite in the smm , instead of the standard liquid - drop description of hot fragments . in this case",
    "the surface energy coefficient is written as @xmath58 mev .",
    "the other parameters were also modified according to ref .",
    "the results of the smm calculations with the myers - swiatecki parametrization are shown in fig .",
    "11 for the ensembles with @xmath57=0.012 , for all three projectiles .",
    "the resulting values of @xmath31 for different projectiles at large @xmath42 are less spread than the results with constant @xmath59  mev ( fig .",
    "10 ) but they do not fit the experimental trend .",
    "moreover , the general agreement with the experiment becomes even worse , since the minimum of @xmath31 is considerably shifted to larger values of @xmath42 .",
    "also @xmath39 is less than 1.5 , which is too low in comparison with the experimental value of about 1.7 .",
    "calculations with other ensembles did not improve the agreement with the experiment .",
    "this suggests that a more detailed investigation of the liquid - drop parameters of fragments in multifragmentation reactions is needed .",
    "returning to the standard smm , we have performed calculations for the same projectile ensembles but with other surface coefficients @xmath25 .",
    "we have selected four intervals @xmath45=0.80.9 , 0.70.8 , 0.60.7 , and 0.50.6 , characterizing the `` rise '' of multifragmentation with excitation energy , for a detailed comparison with the experiment . as one can expect from fig .  5 , in order to fit the higher @xmath31 observed for neutron - poor xe sources at low excitation energies , it is necessary to increase the surface coefficient @xmath25 for the corresponding hot fragments .",
    "as known from previous analyses ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , the secondary decay processes should not significantly influence @xmath31 in this region . for the secondary deexcitation calculations we have used the standard evaporation and fermi break - up models implemented in the smm @xcite .",
    "the same deexcitation code was used in refs . @xcite for describing the aladin data .    the theoretical evolution of @xmath31 with @xmath25 in different @xmath42 bins is shown in fig .",
    "12 . in order to achieve agreement with the experimental data ,",
    "@xmath25 should change with excitation energy when going from compound - like processes to full multifragmentation . in the bin of the largest @xmath60",
    ", this requires @xmath61 , 18.1 , and 17.1 mev for the xe , au , and u ensemble sources , respectively . at @xmath45=0.65 and 0.55 , however , in the region of minimum @xmath31 and full multifragmentation , the values of the surface tension are around @xmath211819 mev for all three sources without essential variation .",
    "we have also analyzed other ensembles and combinations of ensembles for different projectiles , which can reproduce the imf scaling shown in fig .",
    "9 and in ref .",
    "in addition , we require that these ensembles reproduce the experimental @xmath31 in the whole range of @xmath42 by varying @xmath25 .",
    "we have found that such ensembles should have parameters in between @xmath57=0.011 and @xmath57=0.013 . for control ,",
    "we have also tested the extreme cases as , e.g. , @xmath57=0.011 for the ensembles of u sources and @xmath57=0.013 for the xe sources .",
    "even for these ensembles , we have obtained a similar evolution of the @xmath25 isospin dependence as a function of the excitation energy : while @xmath25 depends strongly on @xmath18 at large @xmath42 , it becomes nearly independent of isospin in the region of full multifragmentation .",
    "additional calculations were performed with another secondary decay code developed in ref .",
    "this code starts with the modified surface tension for hot fragments in the freeze - out volume , and then changes the fragment masses during the evaporation process in such a way that the normal surface tension is restored for cold fragments .",
    "it was found that the final results may deviate from the standard calculations by not more than a few percent , and that all trends regarding @xmath25 as a function of the neutron richness of fragments remain the same .",
    "as was postulated earlier ( sect .",
    "[ surf ] ) , the surface term is a function of two parameters , @xmath25 and the critical temperature @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , a dependence of @xmath23 on the neutron content could be an alternative explanation of the isospin dependence of the surface tension in different domains of excitation energy .",
    "this possibility was investigated by performing an analysis with a possible @xmath23 evolution , as suggested in refs .",
    "it was found that , in order to increase @xmath31 to the experimental value observed for xe sources at large @xmath42 , @xmath23 would have to be increased to @xmath62  mev . in the same @xmath42 range , in order to reproduce the value for u sources , @xmath23 would have to be decreased to @xmath63  mev . a @xmath23 variation of this magnitude in a narrow @xmath18 range ( from 1.39 to 1.59 ) is not supported by theoretical calculations @xcite , which predict a variation of @xmath23 within 23% only . in addition",
    ", large @xmath23 differences for the projectile sources will result in a significant violation of the scaling behaviour of fragmentation at high excitation energies , in contradiction to the experiment .",
    "we have mentioned that for small sources , at @xmath640.5 , the experimental filter should be applied for a precise determination of @xmath42 in simulated events .",
    "this would be important for our method since at high excitation energy , as one can see from figs .  4 and 10 , the @xmath31 extracted for the sources of different isospin",
    "nearly coincide , while the @xmath31 values after the ensemble calculations are different , when plotted versus the reduced bound charge .",
    "this is a consequence of dealing with the small sources and large fluctuations at the multifragmentation fall. also , in the region of small @xmath42 , after smm calculations , many observables are less sensitive to differences in the ensembles of sources : as evident from fig .  9",
    ", the slope of @xmath65 versus @xmath45 at small @xmath42 is rather universal for all ensembles and values of @xmath25 , and it coincides with the data @xcite . without independent constraints on the sources in this region , it is not very reliable to extract fragment properties by only using the @xmath31 parametrization of the charge yields . probably , involving isotope distributions of produced fragments and measuring neutrons @xcite will help to determine the ensembles .",
    "we do not touch this problem here but just note that extraction of @xmath25 as a function of the neutron richness at small @xmath42 will depend essentially on the excitation energies of the sources .",
    "as one can see from fig .  5 ( bottom panel ) ,",
    "if the average excitation energy is around 78 mev / nucleon , the sensitivity of @xmath31 to the surface coefficient is lost at @xmath66 mev .",
    "besides their different @xmath18 ratios , the three projectiles differ also in their mass . to first order ,",
    "this is considered by performing the analysis as a function of scaled variables but a residual mass effect may possibly exist .",
    "the calculations presented in ref .",
    "@xcite show , however , that for relatively large sources @xmath67 a difference in the @xmath18 ratio has a larger effect on @xmath31 than a difference in the mass .",
    "moreover , calculations for the fragmentation of nuclei with different @xmath18 and the same mass predict differences in @xmath31 of the same magnitude as obtained here for the considered xe , au and u nuclei ( fig .",
    "this justifies our conclusion that the deviation of the standard smm calculations from the experimental data at low excitation energies is due to the isospin dependence of the surface coefficient .",
    "this conclusion can be tested with fragmentation data in experiments with isotopically different isobars .",
    "it is instructive to compare the surface coefficients extracted above with the ones used usually for cold isolated nuclei . in fig .",
    "13 we show the behavior of this coefficient versus the @xmath18 ratio as extracted from the cameron @xcite and myers - swiatecki @xcite mass formulae by retaining terms proportional to @xmath68 .",
    "the considered @xmath18 range corresponds to the neutron - richness of the sources under investigation .",
    "both mass formulae predict a decrease of @xmath25 with increasing @xmath18 which is necessary in order to reach agreement with experimental mass tables . in multifragmentation , as was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , the neutron content of hot fragments is proportional to the neutron richness of the sources , since most neutrons are accumulated in the fragments .",
    "the values of @xmath25 extracted from the experiment exhibit the same decreasing trend with @xmath18 at low excitation energy and they remain within the @xmath25 range predicted by the mass formulae .",
    "thus , at the rise of multifragmentation , when a heavy residue and few small fragments are formed , @xmath25 resembles the values used in phenomenological parameterizations for isolated nuclei . on the other hand , at full multifragmentation , when the system breaks up into intermediate mass fragments , the surface energy coefficient becomes nearly independent of the neutron richness .",
    "this is particularly evident for the bins @xmath45=0.65 , where the decrease in @xmath25 with @xmath18 is very small , and @xmath45=0.55 , at which the @xmath25 consistent with @xmath31 falls between the two dotted lines ( fig .",
    "these upper and lower limits correspond to the 2% statistical uncertainty in the numerical determination of @xmath31 , typical for both , the smm simulations and the experimental data .",
    "these observations indicate that nuclear fragments are brought to a new physical environment .",
    "their properties change in the hot medium consisting of nucleons and other fragments at subnuclear freeze - out densities , around @xmath69 .",
    "also , modifications of the symmetry energy have been observed in these reactions @xcite .",
    "here , we do not suggest a comprehensive theoretical explanation of these effects , but rather point at the new physical conditions reached in multifragmentation reactions in comparison with isolated nuclei .",
    "the origin of these effects could be a residual nuclear interaction between clusters , in particular , the exchange of neutrons between nuclear fragments .",
    "the role of the coulomb forces is also important .",
    "the coulomb interaction between clusters leads to a modification of their average charges @xcite .",
    "other consequences of the coulomb interaction , like a shift of the proton distributions with respect to the neutron distributions in hot fragments @xcite , may additionally contribute to this effect .",
    "finally we point to the uncertainty connected with the lacking knowledge of the @xmath18 ratio of the produced equilibrated sources after the initial dynamical stage .",
    "the present dynamical codes , like the intranuclear cascade ( inc ) @xcite , and the relativistic quantum molecular dynamics ( rqmd ) @xcite , predict a very small , less than 5@xmath2 , change in comparison with the neutron richness of the projectile nucleus , since interactions of neutrons and protons are very similar at relativistic energies .",
    "this change is expected to be small for all projectiles , therefore , the difference in neutron content should be preserved for the ensembles of projectile sources .",
    "similar conclusions can also be drawn on the basis of existing experimental data : as was established in recent aladin experiments , fragments coming from neutron - rich projectiles remain essentially neutron - rich as compared with fragments from neutron - poor projectiles @xcite . at the same time , the number of produced spectator neutrons is correlated directly with the neutron richness of the projectiles @xcite .",
    "these results indicate that the initial difference in @xmath18 ratios for different projectiles is not washed out for the ensemble of sources during the nonequilibrium stage .",
    "in this paper we have demonstrated that the surface properties of hot fragments can be studied in multifragmentation reactions . within the statistical multifragmentation model",
    "we have shown how modifications of the fragment surface energy influence the fragment production and thermodynamical characteristics of the system at the freeze - out volume . by comparing with the aladin data we have found that in the regime of the  rise  of multifragmentation the observed isospin dependence of the power - law parameter @xmath31 of fragment charge distributions",
    "can not be described by the smm if the standard surface - term coefficient is used .",
    "the data can be reproduced if a moderate dependence on the @xmath18 ratio of the produced fragments is introduced in the surface term . at low excitation energies",
    "this contribution resembles that obtained with advanced mass formulae for ground - state nuclei . at higher excitation energies",
    ", this @xmath18 dependence gradually disappears .    the observed modification of properties of hot nuclei in comparison with cold ( or slightly excited ) isolated nuclei are possibly caused by the hot environment in which the nuclei are imbedded , and where they can interact with nucleons and other fragments .",
    "the resulting in - medium modifications can go beyond the disappearance of shell effects and affect also the main liquid - drop parameters .",
    "our conclusions are substantiated by a very good agreement with experimental data demonstrated by the smm . in the future ,",
    "fully microscopic calculations of the effects of the interacting medium would be very desirable , however , many problems still remain in constructing such a many - body theory .    more generally , we conclude that multifragmentation reactions offer a new possibility for investigating nuclei under conditions essentially different from those accessible in nuclear structure studies at low energies . besides the obvious application of the results for better describing nuclear reactions at intermediate and high energies , this has far - reaching consequences for astrophysics .",
    "in many astrophysical situations , hot matter at subnuclear densities is clusterized into nuclei as , e.g. , in neutron star crusts and supernovae .",
    "the properties of these nuclei are crucial for both microscopic ( weak interactions ) and macroscopic ( collapse dynamics and shock propagation ) processes in stellar matter .",
    "new and important information in this direction may be expected from the analysis of future experimental data on multifragmentation .",
    "the authors would like to thank the aladin collaboration for the permission to use the charge - correlation data for the present analysis .",
