    "golod @xcite , venkov @xcite , and evens @xcite proved that the cohomology ring of a finite group with coefficients in a field of positive characteristic is finitely generated .",
    "this fundamental result opened the door to using geometric methods in the study of cohomology and modular representations of finite groups .",
    "this geometric approach was pioneered by quillen @xcite and expanded by carlson @xcite , and avrunin and scott @xcite .",
    "friedlander and suslin @xcite vastly generalized the result of venkov and evens , proving that the cohomology ring of any finite group scheme ( equivalently , finite dimensional cocommutative hopf algebra ) over a field of positive characteristic is finitely generated . in a different direction , ginzburg and",
    "kumar @xcite computed the cohomology ring of each of lusztig s small quantum groups @xmath0 , defined over @xmath1 , under some restrictions on the parameters ; it is the coordinate ring of the nilpotent cone of the lie algebra @xmath2 , and thus is finitely generated .",
    "the result is parallel to an earlier result of friedlander and parshall @xcite who computed the cohomology ring of a restricted lie algebra in positive characteristic .",
    "recently , bendel , nakano , parshall , and pillen @xcite calculated the cohomology of a small quantum group under significantly loosened restrictions on the parameters .",
    "the broad common feature of these works is that they investigate cohomology of certain nonsemisimple finite dimensional hopf algebras .",
    "hence , these results lead one to ask whether the cohomology ring of any finite dimensional hopf algebra is finitely generated .",
    "a positive answer would simultaneously generalize the known results for cocommutative hopf algebras and for small quantum groups .",
    "more generally , etingof and ostrik @xcite conjectured finite generation of cohomology in the context of finite tensor categories .    in this paper",
    ", we begin the task of proving this conjecture for more general classes of noncocommutative hopf algebras over a field of characteristic 0 .",
    "we prove finite generation of the cohomology ring of any finite dimensional pointed hopf algebra , with abelian group of grouplike elements , under some mild restrictions on the group order .",
    "pointed hopf algebras are precisely those whose coradicals are group algebras , and in turn these groups determine a large part of their structure .",
    "we use the recent classification of these hopf algebras by andruskiewitsch and schneider @xcite .",
    "each has a presentation by generators and relations similar to those of the small quantum groups , yet they are much more general . due to this similarity , some of the techniques of ginzburg and kumar @xcite yield results in this general setting .",
    "however some differences do arise , notably that cohomology may no longer vanish in odd degrees , and that useful connections to lie algebras have not been developed .",
    "thus we must take a somewhat different approach in this paper , which also yields new proofs of some of the results in @xcite . since we have less information available in this general setting , we prove finite generation without computing the full structure of the cohomology ring .",
    "however we do explicitly identify a subalgebra over which the cohomology is finite , and establish some results about its structure .",
    "these structure results follow in part from our general result in section [ bgcc ] , that the cohomology ring of a hopf algebra in a braided category is always braided graded commutative .",
    "this generalizes the well - known result that the cohomology ring of a hopf algebra is graded commutative , one proof of which follows from the existence of two definitions of its multiplication .",
    "we generalize that proof , giving a braided version of the eckmann - hilton argument , from which follows the braided graded commutativity result . we apply this to a nichols algebra in section [ graded ] , thus obtaining some details about the structure of the finitely generated cohomology ring of the corresponding pointed hopf algebra .    of course one hopes for results in yet greater generality .",
    "however the structure of finite dimensional noncommutative , noncocommutative , nonsemisimple hopf algebras , other than those treated in this paper , is largely unknown .",
    "there are a very small number of known ( nontrivial ) finite dimensional pointed hopf algebras having nonabelian groups of grouplike elements ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "even fewer examples are known of nonpointed , nonsemisimple hopf algebras @xcite . to prove finite generation of cohomology in greater generality",
    ", it may be necessary to find general techniques , such as the embedding of any finite group scheme into gl@xmath3 used by friedlander and suslin @xcite , rather than depending on structural knowledge of the hopf algebras as we do here .",
    "our proof of finite generation is a two - step reduction to type @xmath4 , in which case the corresponding nichols algebra is a quantum complete intersection .",
    "for these algebras , we compute cohomology explicitly via a resolution constructed in section [ sec - step0 ] .",
    "this resolution is adapted from @xcite where similar algebras were considered ( but in positive characteristic ) .",
    "each of our two reduction steps involves a spectral sequence associated to an algebra filtration . in the first step ( section [ graded ] ) a radford biproduct of the form @xmath5 , for a group @xmath6 and nichols algebra @xmath7 , has a filtration for which the associated graded algebra has type @xmath8 .",
    "this filtration is generalized from de concini and kac @xcite .",
    "we identify some permanent cycles and apply a lemma adapted from friedlander and suslin @xcite to conclude finite generation . in the second reduction step ( section [ sec - step2 ] ) , any of andruskiewitsch and schneider s pointed hopf algebras @xmath9 has a filtration for which the associated graded algebra is a radford biproduct , whose cohomology features in section [ graded ] .",
    "again we identify some permanent cycles and conclude finite generation . as a corollary",
    "we show that the hochschild cohomology ring of @xmath9 is also finitely generated .",
