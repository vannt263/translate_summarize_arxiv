    "in contrast with the great success of lattice gauge theory , lattice fermions remain a long - standing problem .",
    "naive discretization causes the species doubling problem @xcite . the situation does not change",
    "regardless of how the lattice spacing is reduced as long as the space - time derivative is modeled as a naive difference .",
    "many attempts have been made to fix the doubling problem @xcite .",
    "wilson removed doublers at low energy by introducing an interaction that mixes left- and right - handed fermions @xcite .",
    "however , unwanted degeneracy persist at high energy and chiral symmetry is explicitly broken . to fix these problems ,",
    "kaplan modified wilson s fermion with an extra dimension @xcite and succeeded in realizing approximate chiral symmetry .",
    "however , the cost of numerical calculations based on it is not cheap . if we find a method to perform such calculations without the extra dimension , calculation time decreases largely and a deeper understanding of quantum field theory becomes possible .",
    "the lattice fermion has another serious problem .",
    "the fermion propagator defined on a lattice deviates from the continuum one even if the doublers are removed with the existing techniques such as kaplan s fermion @xcite .",
    "we need to modify the discretized propagator somehow so that it is close to the continuum one as far as possible .",
    "in general , the extra dimension can be expressed as hopping interactions in a lower - dimensional system .",
    "kaplan s fermion is a formulation with an extra dimension , so there must be a corresponding hamiltonian with no extra dimension .",
    "also , the shape of the fermion propagator can be improved with hopping interactions .    in this talk ,",
    "based on a hamiltonian formalism , we introduce ultralocal hopping interactions to remove doublers and improve momentum dependence of fermion energy . ( the word ",
    "ultralocal \" means that fermion hopping is restricted to a finite range on a real - space lattice @xcite . ) from knowledge of the continuum theory , we know the correct momentum dependence of the energy .",
    "we start from momentum space and go back to real space by way of discrete fourier transform .",
    "@xcite for the details of this work .",
    "let us consider a free dirac fermion on a ( 1 + 1)-dimensional hamiltonian lattice .",
    "@xmath0 where @xmath1 is an index for momentum and @xmath2 is the number of sites .",
    "@xmath3 and @xmath4 are discrete fourier transform of real - space two - component fermion operators @xmath5 and @xmath6 for @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "the system is quantized with anticommutators in the usual way .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are assumed in real space , @xmath8 .",
    "we try to create a real - space hamiltonian with no doubler that reproduces eq .",
    "( [ h1 ] ) . to find real - space representation of @xmath9 ,",
    "let us consider the following function @xmath10 in the limit @xmath11 , the function ( [ sp ] ) goes to @xmath12 .",
    "the function ( [ sp ] ) necessarily has a node at the boundary @xmath13 because it has a periodicity of @xmath14 .",
    "the node is the cause of the doubling problem .",
    "the doubler remains as a singularity at the boundary even if the limit @xmath11 is taken ( by  doubler \" we mean unwanted energy degeneracy that is not contained in the continuum theory ) .",
    "anyway , the parameter @xmath15 needs to be small for practical formulation because @xmath15 corresponds to the maximum distance of fermion hopping .",
    "in addition to the doubler around the momentum boundary , the function ( [ sp ] ) has another degeneracy .",
    "it oscillates around @xmath12 and has local minima if the summation is truncated with a small @xmath15 . in fourier analysis",
    ", it is called the gibbs phenomenon , which occurs if a function to be expanded has a singularity @xcite .",
    "the oscillation can be removed by replacing eq .",
    "( [ sp ] ) with @xmath16 where @xmath17 @xmath18 is called the lanczos factor @xcite .",
    "the factor almost removes the oscillation of eq .",
    ". however , the doubler modes around the boundary still remain .",
    "we are going to remove them by a trick with hopping interactions .",
    "let us consider the following momentum - space hamiltonian : @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 is fermion mass .",
    "we introduce interactions @xmath22 that mix left- and right - handed fermions @xmath23 where @xmath22 are assumed to be nonzero only for @xmath24",
    ". the hamiltonian ( [ h4 ] ) can be diagonalized .",
    "@xmath25 where @xmath26 are energies of one particle states and @xmath27 are transformed variables .",
    "the coefficients @xmath22 are determined so that energy of one - particle states becomes close to the continuum one as far as possible .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the functions @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 are compared , where @xmath31 .",
    "the function @xmath30 corresponds to energy of one - particle states given by the hamiltonian ( [ h4 ] ) with @xmath32 .",
    "the function @xmath30 agrees well with the correct energy @xmath28 from the continuum theory in the fundamental region @xmath33 .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ h4 ] ) approximately reproduces the continuum theory without doubler if we identify @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows the diagonal and off - diagonal matrix elements of the transformed @xmath36 in the new basis that diagonalizes the hamiltonian ( [ h4 ] ) with @xmath32 .",
    "the diagonal ( 1,1 ) element of @xmath37 is almost unity at low and intermediate energy @xmath38 and deviates from unity at @xmath39 .",
    "the off - diagonal ( 1,2 ) element of @xmath37 oscillates around zero at @xmath38 and becomes unity at @xmath40 . at low energy , the deviation of the off - diagonal elements from zero",
    "is not large and becomes smaller as the parameter @xmath15 increases . at @xmath38 , the transformed left- and right - handed fermions",
    "have approximately the correct chiral charges @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively . the low - energy hamiltonian ( [ h4 ] ) has approximate chiral symmetry because the commutation relation between the hamiltonian ( [ h4 ] ) and chiral charge defined with @xmath37 is almost zero for small @xmath1 .",
    "the errors associated with chiral symmetry can be improved in a systematic way by increasing @xmath15 .",
    "the value used here for the parameter @xmath15 is sufficiently small and does not deny application of the model to actual numerical analysis with a computer .",
    "the real - space hamiltonian and the euclidean action for the dirac spinor is obtained by substituting the discrete fourier transform into eq .",
    "( [ h4 ] ) . as usual ,",
    "gauge symmetry can be implemented by inserting exponentiated gauge fields between the hopping fermions .",
    "the continuum limit @xmath43 is taken with @xmath15 fixed .",
    "the method can be extended to higher - dimensional cases by taking care of the doubler of each direction in the same way .    in this talk ,",
