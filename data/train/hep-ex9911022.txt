    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) predicts the existence of bound states of gluons , called glueballs .",
    "lattice calculations have predicted the lightest scalar glueball to be a scalar resonance with mass @xmath6  @xcite with tensor and pseudoscalar glueballs in the @xmath7 region  @xcite .    experimentally two principal candidates for the scalar glueball have been observed , the @xmath8 and the @xmath9 ( a review is given in  @xcite ) .",
    "both are seen in gluon - rich reactions such as @xmath10 annihilation , central production and radiative decay .",
    "the @xmath8 does not fit naturally in the @xmath11 spectrum but could be due to a glueball mixed with @xmath11 states in that mass region  @xcite .",
    "the spin of the @xmath9 is not yet confirmed , indications for both spin 2 and spin 0 have been reported  @xcite .",
    "if the @xmath9 is indeed spin 0 it becomes a candidate for the @xmath12-like state in the @xmath13 region , but also for the lightest scalar glueball  @xcite .",
    "in @xmath14 interactions , production of a pure gluon state is suppressed .",
    "measuring the two - photon width @xmath15 of the @xmath8 and the @xmath9 , or setting an upper limit on @xmath15 , should indicate whether either is likely to be a pure glueball or has quark content .",
    "the cleo collaboration has recently published a stringent limit on the two - photon width of the @xmath16 resonance ( formerly the @xmath17 ) which is a candidate for the tensor glueball  @xcite .    at the lep @xmath18 collider",
    "there is a large cross - section for inelastic two - photon scattering , in which each of the incoming electrons acts as a source of virtual photons . in this analysis ,",
    "the processes @xmath19 and @xmath20 have been studied and upper limits extracted for @xmath21 of both resonances .",
    "the aleph detector and its performance are described in detail elsewhere  @xcite . here",
    "only a brief description of the detector components relevant for this analysis is given .",
    "the trajectories of charged particles are measured with a silicon vertex detector ( vdet ) , a cylindrical multiwire drift chamber ( itc ) and a large time projection chamber ( tpc ) .",
    "the three detectors are immersed in a 1.5 t axial magnetic field from the superconducting solenoidal coil and together provide a transverse momentum resolution @xmath22 0.005 ( @xmath23 in ) .",
    "the tpc also provides up to 338 measurements of ionisation ( d_e_/d_x _ ) used for particle identification .    between the tpc and the coil , an electromagnetic calorimeter ( ecal )",
    "is used to identify electrons and photons and to measure their energy with a relative resolution of 0.18/@xmath24 ( @xmath25 in gev ) .",
    "the luminosity calorimeters ( lcal and sical ) cover the small polar angle region , 24190 mrad .",
    "muons are identified by their characteristic penetration pattern in the hadron calorimeter ( hcal ) , a 1.2 m thick iron yoke instrumented with 23 layers of limited streamer tubes , together with two surrounding layers of muon chambers . in association with the electromagnetic calorimeter",
    ", the hadron calorimeter also provides a measurement of the energy of charged and neutral hadrons with a relative resolution of 0.85/@xmath26 ( @xmath25 in gev ) .",
    "the main aleph trigger relevant for this analysis , for data taken in 1994 and after , is based on the identification of two track candidates in the itc , with at least one track pointing to an energy deposit in excess of 200 mev in the ecal .",
    "the two track candidates are confirmed at the second trigger level using the tpc . for data taken before 1994 , the analysis relies on a trigger of two itc ( and tpc ) track candidates measured back - to - back within @xmath27 .",
    "fully simulated monte carlo event samples reconstructed with the same program as the data have been used for the design of the event selection , background estimation and extraction of a limit on two - photon widths @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "samples of the signal processes @xmath30 and @xmath31 were generated using phot02  @xcite .",
    "each sample was generated as a breit - wigner resonance of appropriate mass , width and spin , with the @xmath2 here assumed to be spin zero .",
    "the experimental resolution of the masses of both resonances is of the order of @xmath32 , compared to full widths in excess of @xmath33 .    expected background processes @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 were also generated using phot02 , while background from @xmath37 was estimated using koralz  @xcite .",
    "both programs are interfaced to the jetset  @xcite package for hadronisation , while koralz also includes tauola  @xcite for correct handling of the @xmath38 polarisation .",
    "this analysis uses 160.9 of data taken around @xmath39 gev from 1990 to 1995 .",
    "candidate events for @xmath40 are selected according to the following criteria :    * the event contains only two good tracks , of equal and opposite charge .",
    "good tracks are defined to have at least four tpc hits , @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the polar angle with respect to beam axis , and a minimum distance to the interaction point of less than 8 cm along the beam axis and 2 cm in the radial direction ; * the total energy summed over all objects reconstructed by the energy flow program is equal to the total energy of the two charged tracks ; * the primary vertex is reconstructed within @xmath43 cm of the nominal interaction point along the beam axis ; * the total energy observed in the event is less than 30 gev and visible mass less than 10 gev , to exclude z events ; * the transverse momentum of the final state with respect to the beam axis does not exceed @xmath44 ; * the absolute value of the cosine of the angle @xmath45 between the two tracks in their centre - of - mass system and the boost direction is required to be less than 0.9 .",
    "these criteria ensure ( quasi-)real photon ( @xmath46 ) collisions , and also suppress three- or more body decay .",
    "the dominant background to the two - pion signal is the @xmath47 process . at low energies , muons and pions",
    "can not easily be distinguished from each other and the high cross - section for the @xmath47 process leads to a substantial contamination of the @xmath48 sample .    to reduce background , events containing identified muons  @xcite",
    "are rejected . with",
    "a sample of @xmath47 events generated using phot02 , it was found that the efficiency of rejection is about 100% for events with invariant mass @xmath49 .",
    "below @xmath50 , the rejection efficiency is improved by means of simple cuts on the fraction of energy deposited in the ecal and hcal , but still the rejection efficiency falls off rapidly , being only @xmath51% for @xmath52 . for @xmath53",
    "the average rejection efficiency for @xmath47 events is 45% .",
    "after muon rejection , the specific ionisation ( d_e_/d_x _ ) of each track , measured in the tpc , is required to be within three standard deviations of the expected ionisation for a pion and more than three standard deviations from that of an electron .",
    "separation of pions and kaons by is less efficient , but the rate of kaon pair production is low : from a monte carlo sample of @xmath54 , a residual contamination of only @xmath55 was estimated .",
    "possible background from beam - gas interactions was investigated . constraining the reconstructed primary vertex position in @xmath56",
    "removes most of this background .",
    "as beam - gas events are uniformly distributed in @xmath56 , the number of events falling outside the @xmath56-vertex cut can be used to estimate the remaining background inside the cut : beam - gas contamination is found to be negligible .",
    "residual backgrounds from the processes @xmath57 and @xmath58 are also negligible .    a sample of 294141 @xmath3 candidate events is selected .",
    "the @xmath48 invariant mass spectrum obtained is shown in fig .",
    "[ pipimass ] .",
    "the steep rise of the spectrum around @xmath59 is an artefact of the trigger efficiency .",
    "the clear peak in the spectrum above @xmath60 can be identified as the known tensor resonance @xmath61 .",
    "= 7.5 cm    no other structure is observed above the @xmath61 peak .",
    "a fit to the invariant mass spectrum is performed . for the resonances @xmath61 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , a breit - wigner function of the form @xmath62 is used , where the mass - dependent width @xmath63 , away from the two - pion threshold , has the form @xmath64\\ ] ] and @xmath65  @xcite . for the @xmath61",
    "the mass @xmath66 , total width @xmath67 and overall normalisation are free parameters . for the @xmath1 and the @xmath2",
    "the normalisation is a free parameter , while the mass and width are fixed to @xmath68 and @xmath69 for the @xmath1 and @xmath70 and @xmath71 for the @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 is considered here as a @xmath72 state .",
    "although the presence of two objects in the @xmath73 region has been suggested  @xcite , no attempt to resolve two objects is made here .",
    "the background spectrum , due to @xmath74 events and the @xmath75 continuum process , is fitted on the data with a @xmath76 order chebyshev polynomial .",
    "the mass region 0.8 to @xmath77 is used in the fit ( below @xmath78 the trigger efficiency falls to less than 20% ) .",
    "four fits are performed , each including a breit - wigner for the @xmath61 and the polynomial background and then including    * no additional resonances , * the @xmath1 , * the @xmath2 , * both the @xmath1 and the @xmath2 .",
    "= 7.5 cm    the fit to the data is shown in fig .",
    "[ fitmass ] for case ( i ) : the breit - wigner shape for the @xmath61 , the polynomial for background processes and the sum of these are indicated .",
    "the parameters of all fits are summarised in table  [ fitparam ] , including the number of events fitted for the glueball candidate signals .",
    "for the fit including the @xmath61 alone , the @xmath79 of 75 for 76 degrees of freedom is already very good .",
    "the @xmath79 per degree of freedom hardly changes with the addition of glueball signals .",
    "the fits including the @xmath2 were also performed for @xmath80 .",
    "the results of these fits were essentially the same as for the @xmath72 case .",
    ".[fitparam ] table of parameters for fits using the breit - wigner form of eqn.[bw ] for resonances . [ cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the upper limit on @xmath81 for the case when only the @xmath8 is included is 0.33 kev , and for the @xmath9 only is 0.84 kev . for the case including both resonances ,",
    "the upper limits are 0.28 kev and 0.69 kev for the @xmath8 and the @xmath9 respectively .",
    "these limits are consistent with the original results .",
    "from limits on @xmath15 the _ stickiness _  @xcite of each resonance can be calculated , by comparison of the two photon width with the particle s width for production in the glue - rich environment of radiative decay .",
    "the ratio is normalised such that the @xmath11 resonance @xmath61 has stickiness equal to 1 .",
    "then for a glueball a higher value of stickiness is expected .",
    "stickiness for a @xmath82 resonance @xmath83 is defined as @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the mass of the resonance ; @xmath86 is the energy of the photon from the radiative decay , measured in the rest frame ; @xmath87 is the width for production of the resonance in radiative decay ; and @xmath88 is the normalisation factor .",
    "the branching ratio for @xmath89 is taken as @xmath90 , while the branching ratio for @xmath91 is @xmath92  @xcite , giving , from the fit for both resonances , @xmath93 = 1.08 kev and @xmath94 = 21.25 kev .",
    "the lower limits on stickiness are then 1.4 and 0.3 for the @xmath1 and the @xmath2 respectively .",
    "production of the glueball candidates @xmath1 and @xmath2 in @xmath14 collisions at lep1 has been studied via decay to @xmath48 .",
    "no signal from either resonance is seen , and the upper limits on the product of two - photon width and @xmath3 branching ratio have been calculated as @xmath95 kev for the @xmath96 and @xmath97 kev for the @xmath98 , both at 95% , from a simultaneous fit for both resonances .",
