    "many beyond - the - standard - model models predict the existence of new massive strongly produced objects that decay into quarks ( @xmath1 ) and gluons ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "these states may show up as narrow resonances in the leading ( highest @xmath3 ) jet spectrum .",
    "we consider the following models : string resonance ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 )  @xcite ; @xmath7 diquark ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) predicted from grand unified theory based on the @xmath7 gauge group  @xcite ; excited quarks @xmath10 ( @xmath4 ) expected from composite quark model  @xcite ; axial vector particles called axigluons @xmath11 ( @xmath5 )  @xcite ; color - octet vector @xmath12 ( @xmath5 )  @xcite ; color - octet scalar @xmath13 ( @xmath6 )  @xcite ; new gauge bosons @xmath14 and @xmath15 from new gauge symmetries ( @xmath5 )  @xcite ; massive gravitons @xmath16 ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) from the randall - sundrum ( rs ) model of extra dimensions  @xcite . the color - octet vector is predicted by the flavor - universal coloron model , which embeds the su(3 ) symmetry of qcd in a larger gauge group ; the color - octet scalar is included in many dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking models , such as technicolor .",
    "in addition to singly produced particles , many models predict the pair production of massive colored particles  @xcite .",
    "the searches of new narrow resonance in the leading dijet mass spectrum is not optimized for pair - produced particles for the following reason : the probability that one of the particles decays into the two leading dijet is only about 10% . a dedicated search is needed for pair - produced particle .",
    "we use coloron production as our benchmark model ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "we also consider the possibility that colorons decay into color - octet scalars ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "furthermore , we consider an r - parity violating susy model  @xcite in which pair - produced top squark ( stops ) each decay to @xmath5 as a third possibility .",
    "jets are reconstructed using a particle flow technique  @xcite at cms  @xcite .",
    "the cms particle - flow algorithm combines calorimeter information with reconstructed tracks to identify photons , leptons , and both neutral and charged hadrons within jets .",
    "the particle - flow objects serve as input for jet reconstruction , performed using the anti-@xmath18 algorithm  @xcite with a cone radius @xmath19 of 0.5 or 0.7 .",
    "jet energy scale corrections are derived from monte carlo ( mc ) simulation  @xcite as well as data .",
    "we search for narrow resonances in the dijet mass spectrum using the two leading jets in the data .",
    "the data sample is collected with multijet high - level triggers based on @xmath20 , the scalar sum of the transverse momenta of all jets in the event with @xmath21 40 gev and @xmath22 .",
    "the @xmath20 threshold are 650 gev and 750 gev , depending on the running period .",
    "the trigger efficiency is measured from the data to be larger than 99.9% for dijet masses reconstructed offline above 890 gev .",
    "jets that pass the standard jet quality requirements are combined into `` wide jets ''  @xcite if their separation @xmath23 .",
    "the combining is done before determining the leading dijet mass spectrum .",
    "the data used in this study correspond to an integrated luminosity of 4.0 fb@xmath24 at a collision energy of @xmath0=8 tev  @xcite .",
    "the dijet mass background shape is modeled by a smooth parameterization .",
    "the dijet resonance shapes for @xmath9 , @xmath4 and @xmath6 partons are dominated by experimental resolution and are obtained from full simulation .",
    "no significant excess is observed .",
    "the upper limits at 95% cl set on the cross section times branching ratio times acceptance of centrally ( @xmath25 and @xmath22 ) produced dijet mass resonances for ( @xmath9 , @xmath4 , @xmath6 ) are shown in fig .",

    "we set lower limits on the mass of string resonances , excited quarks , axigluons , colorons , @xmath13 resonances , @xmath26 diquarks , w@xmath27 and z@xmath27 bosons , and rs gravitons in the 14.7 tev range as listed in table  [ exclusionlimits_fat ] .",
    "many of the values in the table represent significant improvements on exclusion limits from previous dijet mass searches .     for dijet resonances decaying through gluon - gluon ( open circles ) , quark - gluon ( solid circles ) , and quark - quark ( open boxes ) channels compared with theoretical predictions for string resonances  @xcite , @xmath28 diquarks  @xcite , excited quarks  @xcite , axigluons  @xcite , colorons  @xcite , @xmath13 resonances  @xcite , new gauge bosons @xmath29 and @xmath30  @xcite , and randall - sundrum gravitons  @xcite . ]    .observed and expected 95% cl exclusions on the mass of various resonances .",
    "systematic uncertainties are included . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we search for new narrow resonances in the paired dijet mass spectrum .",
    "the data sample is collected with triggers that require the presence of at least four jets , based on information from the calorimeters .",
    "each jet must have @xmath31 and @xmath32 or 80 gev , depending on the run period .",
    "the trigger is 99.5% efficient for events with our selection  four leading jets , each with a @xmath3 exceeding 110 gev with @xmath22 .",
    "the two jets in every possible pairs is required to have a separation on @xmath33 to ensure a negligible overlap among the jets .",
    "there are three possible dijet pairs from the leading four jets , and each dijet pair is required to have @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the mass difference between the two dijets and @xmath36 is their average mass . thus the difference is required to be less than three times the dijet mass resolution ( 4.5% ) .",
    "we require @xmath37 gev for each dijet , where @xmath38 is the scalar sum of the transverse momenta of the two jets in the dijet and the average pair mass in the event .",
    "the @xmath39 requirement removes a broad structure around 300 gev from qcd events and ensures a smoothly falling dijet mass background shape .",
    "it also reduces the qcd background by more than an order of magnitude while retaining approximately 25% of the signal .    the data used in this study correspond to an integrated luminosity of 5.0 fb@xmath24 at a collision energy of @xmath0=7 tev  @xcite .",
