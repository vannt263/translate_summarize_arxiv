    "it is only since two decades , that the physicists have begun intensively to study structural and topological properties of complex networks @xcite ( and refs .",
    "therein ) in order better to understand the mechanisms responsible for the evolution of complex systems .",
    "the theory of networks , or graphs , is based on the notion of vertices ( or nodes )  which can be identified with individual elements of the system , and edges ( or links )  which represent any connection between a pair of nodes .",
    "physicists have discovered that in most of real - life graphs , small and finite loops are rare and insignificant .",
    "it can be conveniently assumed , that the topologies of many real world systems graphs are locally dominated by trees of which the properties have been extensively exploited .",
    "therefore , we decided on the minimal spanning tree ( mst ) technique .",
    "it is a particularly useful , canonical tool in graph theory @xcite , being a correlation based network without any loop @xcite .",
    "for such a network the inter - node distance equals @xmath0 for any pair of vertices .",
    "the transformation from the pearson s correlation coefficient , @xmath1 , to distance , @xmath2 , is necessary because , the correlation coefficient does not obey the axioms of a metric ( or even axioms of a subdominant ultrametric distance @xcite ) .",
    "prior to crash , the positive feedback or the herding effect dominates the behaviour of the stock market @xcite .",
    "hence , we can suppose that several stocks can be indirectly correlated , mainly over the trend forming a stock market bubble",
    ". such a trend could potentially be the main source of spurious correlations and ( non - partial ) granger causality ( usually difficult to calculate directly , cf .",
    "@xcite and refs .",
    "therein ) .",
    "we , therefore , substract the trend from all the assets time series , following a well known approach @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we consider by numerical means , the evolution of @xmath3 companies quoted on the frankfurt stock exchange ( fse ) , during the most intriguing period ranging from 2005 - 01 - 03 to 2008 - 08 - 12 .",
    "we divided this period into three sub - periods : ( i ) the first one ranging from 2005 - 01 - 03 to 2006 - 03 - 09 and consisting of 309 trading days , ( ii ) the next sub - period from 2006 - 04 - 20 to 2007 - 10 - 11 and consisting of 400 trading days , and ( iii ) the third one ranging from 2007 - 06 - 01 to 2008 - 08 - 12 and consisting of 313 trading days .",
    "this division , equipped with a little overlap between the second and third sub - periods , results in the most distinct msts .",
    "the differences rendered between subsequent states of the market obtained in this way , are most pronounced , as described in the following .    from the above",
    "mentioned 562 companies , only @xmath4 companies survived until the end of the first sub - period . at the end of the second and the third period",
    "there are @xmath5 companies , although several of them ( more than @xmath6 ) are different companies . indeed , during the market evolution from one sub - period to another",
    ", some vertices and edges may disappear in the corresponding network , while new vertices are created .",
    "furthermore , the distances between vertices may also vary in time .",
    "therefore , we regard the number of vertices and edges of the network as non - conserved quantities varying over time . consequently , the characteristics of network s topology considered in this work as the most appropriate ones are time varying .",
    "these entail e.g. the mean occupation layer  this quantity is more sensitive than , for instance , mean tree length @xcite .",
    "this is because the logarithm of the mean occupation layer resembles nonequilibrium entropy of a topological complex network ( see section [ section : results ] ) , which helps to identify the temporal key vertices in a complex network @xcite .",
    "we applied the mst technique to investigate transient behaviour of a low - order complex network during its evolution from a scale - free topology representing the stock market hierarchical structure before the recent worldwide financial crash @xcite , to a superstar - like tree ( or superhub ) decorated by scale - free hierarchy of trees ( or hubs )  representing a high - order market structure during the period containing the crash .",
    "such a superstar - like mst corresponds with a relatively unstable ( or metastable ) state of financial market .",
    "this is because the structure of this state is much too ordered , compared with the equilibrium state .",
    "subsequently , we found a transition from this unstable ( or metastable ) state to scale - free topology , decorated by a hierarchy of local star - like trees or hubs , again representing lower order market structure and topology directly after the worldwide financial crash .",
    "similar types of transitions were found not only on the fse but also on the warsaw stock exchange ( wse )  a complex network of 274 companies , quoted on the wse throughout the period in question . here , we omitted the results obtained for the wse because they resemble those found for the fse and they have been presented in ref .",
    "both our results , that is for wse and fse , are much more pronounced than those found by onnela , chakraborti , kaski , and kertsz for 116 stocks of s&p 500 index in the vicinity of black monday ( october 19 , 1987 ) @xcite and also in the vicinity of january 1 , 1998 @xcite .",
    "we foresee that our results , complementary in nature to the work by our colleagues reported in ref .",
    "@xcite ( and refs .",

    "this exponent is distinctly larger than the corresponding one of the hierarchical mst on the wse , which equals @xmath18 @xcite ; coincidentally , this exponent value also characterises , e.g. , the complex network of e - mails @xcite .",

    "however , the slope of the corresponding superhub on the wse is driven by the distinctly larger slope equal to @xmath21 ; the latter slope is also characteristic for the complex network of actors ( where also superstars are present ) @xcite as well as for the forex mst network where other than usd currencies were assumed as the basic ones ( cf .",
    "table 1 in ref .",

    "@xcite ) . obviously , this is a far going hypothesis which requires a systematic study .",
    "finding a proper local dynamical analytical description ( perhaps nonlinear ) for our network would be a formidable challenge .",
    "this can be appreciated by observing that the single vertex ( representing the saltzgitter ag ",
    "stahl und technologie company ) is located far from the straight line ( in the log - log plot ) and can be considered to be a temporally outstanding , extreme event or a dragon king @xcite , which condenses most of the edges ( or links ) .",

    "the sub - period of time containing the financial market crash was divided into two slightly overlapping intervals : the first one ( already considered ) from 2006 - 04 - 20 to 2007 - 10 - 31 and the second one from 2007 - 06 - 01 to 2008 - 08 - 12 .",
    "although both time intervals contain the worldwide financial crash , only the first mst is decorated by the dragon king , while for the second time interval mst is decorated by several intermediate hubs , somehow located between black swans and the dragon king ( cf .",

    "the accelerated increase of @xmath24 vs. time ( the left - hand side of the peak plotted by the solid curve ) observed , can in our case be considered as a signature of a dragon king , which appeared in the space of vertex degrees . indeed ,",
    "this results in a systematic ( up to some relatively small fluctuations ) expantion of szg dynamics , ending in a superhub ( or dragon king ) star - like structure .",
    "this superhub is indeed a macro - transient structure , as it survives for only about half a year and decays afterwards ( see the right hand side of the peak ) .",

    "it is interesting that several new hubs appeared for the period of time from 2007 - 06 - 01 to 2008 - 08 - 12 , while a single superhub ( superstar ) disappeared , becoming a usual hub .",
    "this means that the structure and topology of the complex network significantly varies during its evolution through the market crash .",
    "this is well confirmed by the plot in figure [ figure:214_new ] , where several points representing large hubs ( but not superhubs ) are located outside the power law .",

    "however , for the actual real - life situation shown in figure [ figure:20080812_asien ] , there also exist several subtrees ( or local star - like trees ) , apart from the superstar - like tree , placed relatively far from the central vertex .",
    "hence , it is not surprising , that the resulting time - dependent mean occupation layer exceeds @xmath42 ( cf .",
    "figure [ figure : mean_layer ] ) being still , however , sufficiently small .",
    "the mean occupation layer can be considered as the configurational weight of a macrostate of the complex network .",
    "this quantity is more sensitive to the complex network centrality than other quantities ( e.g. the mean length used in our earlier work @xcite ) and its logarithm could be considered as a topological complex network entropy .    in figure",
    "[ figure : mean_layer ] , two essentially different types of predictions are shown .",
    "for the first type of prediction ( dashed curve ) the salzgitter ag ",
    "stahl und technologie company was assumed to be the central hub all the time .",
    "such an approach could be referred to as a static one .",
    "the second type of prediction ( solid curve ) was obtained using the dynamic approach .",
    "apparently , within the short sub - period ranging from 2006 - 11 - 01 to 2007 - 09 - 01 both approaches result in coinciding predictions , which coincidented .",
    "that is , the salzgitter ag  stahl und technologie company is certainly the central hub in this sub - period ( which is the main segment of the longer sub - period from 2006 - 04 - 20 to 2007 - 10 - 31 ) .",
    "indeed , the super - star like tree survived only in this segment .",
    "this is the most significant result of our work , indicating the existence of the most compact structure ( mainly the super - star like one ) at the beginning of 2007 , but not at other times .",
    "we can consider the time - dependent mean occupation layer to be a time - dependent disorder parameter .",
    "for instance , this parameter indicates that the mst shown in figure [ figure:20080812_asien ] is less disordered than those shown in figures [ figure:20060309_asien ] and [ figure:20080701 - 20110228_new ] , as expected .    to make confirmation of the solid network variation during its evolution , which relates to nonequilibrium statistical thermodynamics and information theory , we introduced two different time - dependent entropies . the first one , which we call degree entropy , @xmath43 , is based on the empirical time - dependent degree distribution , @xmath44 .",
    "this entropy takes the form , @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the maximal vertex degree at time @xmath47 .",
    "the second entropy , which we call the efficient one , @xmath48 , is based on inversed lengths of edges ( or inversed distances between directly connected verticies ) .",
    "it is defined as follows , @xmath49",
    "where distribution of direct distances @xmath50 , here @xmath51 is a temporal degree of vertex @xmath52 and normalisation factor @xmath53 . in fig .",
    "[ figure : entropy ] both empirical entropies were plotted vs. time . apparently , the shape of both curves resemble those of mols shown in fig .",
    "[ figure : mean_layer ] .",
    "it is amazing how similar are both entropy curves .",
    "this unusual rebustness of the curve s shapes is likely caused by existence of the superhub .",
    "furthermore , the absolute minimum of both entropies is ( to good approximation ) located at the same time as for mols .",
    "hence , we suppose that observed features deeply relate structural and topologial properties of the network with their statistical thermodynamic and informational counterparts .     for details).,width=491 ]    to be sure that szg company is responsible for the existence of the absolute minimum of the mol at january 29 , 2007 ( shown in fig .",
    "[ figure : mean_layer ] ) , we compare in fig . [ figure:2_mols ] to essentially different mols : ( i ) the above mentioned mol and the second one ( ii ) calculated for the modified fse , where the salzgitter ag  stahl und technologie was absent .",
    "apparently , the behaviour of both curves is drastically different and no absolute minimum ( as defined above ) is present for the second mol .",
    "in this work , we have studied the empirical evolving correlated network associated with the fse - a stock exchange of medium capitalisation .",
    "our results reveal a surprising fact that a company of a medium size ( herein salzgitter ag  stahl und technologie ) becomes a dominant hub  a superhub  in the critical , metastable regime ( i.e. in the second period considered , cf .",
    "figure [ figure:20080812_asien ] for details ) .",
    "this is because correlations between this company and other more significant ones likely become weaker in the vicinity of the crash regime .",
    "this results in the relative increase of the correlations with less important companies , such as , for instance , the salzgitter ag  stahl und technologie  which also remains relatively unaffected within the entire period of the market evolution considered here .",
    "our work provides an empirical evidence of a dynamic structural and topological first order phase transition ( or discontinuous one ) in the time range dominated by a stock market crash ( that is , from 2006 - 04 - 20 to 2007 - 10 - 31 ) . before and after this range , the superhub ( or unstable state of fse ) diappears",
    "and we respectively observe either a pure hierarchical , scale - free mst or a hierarchical mst decorated by several hubs .",
    "hence , our results consistently confirm the existence of the following dynamic structural and topological phase transitions , which can be briefly summarized as folows : @xmath54 we hypothesise that the first of these transitions can be considered to be a precursor of a financial crash as it appeared a few months before this crash .",
    "another significant observation presented in this work appertains to the power laws plotted in figures [ figure : spok_nie_spok ] , [ figure : spoko_nie_spoko ] , and [ figure:214_new ] .",
    "namely , the exponent of degree distribution presented in figure [ figure : spoko_nie_spoko ] is , in fact , distinctly smaller than @xmath55 , which means that the variance of this vertex degree diverges .",
    "this result indicates that we are here dealing with criticality , which means that the scenario of our network evolution takes place within a scaling region @xcite containing critical phenomena .",
    "our results are to some degree complementary to those obtained earlier by drod , kwapie and speth @xcite .",
    "their results focused on the slow ( stable ) component ( or state ) .",
    "namely , they constructed the mst network of 1000 highly capitalized american companies .",
    "the topology of this mst show its centralization around the most important relatively stable node , it being the general electric .",
    "this was found both in the frame of binary and weighted msts .    in this context",
    ", the fact should be stressed that the discontinuous phase transition ( i.e. the first order phase one ) topologically preceds and develops into the continuous phase transition ( i.e. the second order one ) .",
    "this discontinuous phase transition goes over the unstable state involving , perhaps , a superheated state such as the superhub in our case .",
    "this can not be considered as noise in the system , but rather should be considered as a result of the natural evolution of the system until the critical point is reached ( cf .",
    "@xcite and refs .",
    "therein , where the role of stable states ( or slow components ) on nyse or nasdaq was considered by using binary and weighted msts ) .    in this work we also studied ( but did not visualize ) the stock market evolution for the subsequent ( the fourth ) time interval from 2008 - 07 - 01 to 2011 - 02 - 28 and found the power law degree of distribution driven by exponent equals @xmath56 . in addition , the power law was decorated by a few points located far above this law .",
    "this likely indicates , that the system after leaving one critical regime , is approaching a new one .",
    "we suppose that the phenomenological theory of cooperative phenomena in networks proposed by goltsev et al .",
    "@xcite might be a promising first attempt to investigate this kind of structural topological dynamics of criticality .",
    "an alternative view might consider the superhub phase to be a temporal condensate @xcite .",
    "hence , we can briefly reformulate the above - mentioned phase transitions as representing the dynamic transition from the excited phase into the condensate and then the transition outside of the condensate to an excited phase again .    obviously , an analytical treatment of the dynamics of such a network phase transition , in particular the superstar - like tree formation , is a formidable challenge .",
    "we can conclude this work with the hope that the continued detailed study of phase transitions presented may define the basis for a better understanding of a stock market crash dynamics and a basis for theory development .",

    "<S> we find numerical and empirical evidence for dynamical , structural and topological phase transitions on the ( german ) frankfurt stock exchange ( fse ) in the temporal vicinity of the worldwide financial crash . </S>",
    "<S> using the minimal spanning tree ( mst ) technique , a particularly useful canonical tool of the graph theory , two transitions of the topology of a complex network representing fse were found . </S>",
    "<S> first transition is from a hierarchical scale - free mst representing the stock market before the recent worldwide financial crash , to a superstar - like mst decorated by a scale - free hierarchy of trees representing the market s state for the period containing the crash . </S>",
    "<S> subsequently , a transition is observed from this transient , ( meta)stable state of the crash , to a hierarchical scale - free mst decorated by several star - like trees after the worldwide financial crash . </S>",
    "<S> the phase transitions observed are analogous to the ones we obtained earlier for the warsaw stock exchange and more pronounced than those found by onnela - chakraborti - kaski - kertsz for s&p 500 index in the vicinity of black monday ( october 19 , 1987 ) and also in the vicinity of january 1 , 1998 . </S>",
