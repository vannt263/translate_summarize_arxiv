    "inflation , originally introduced to solve the initial condition problems of standard cosmology ( sc )  @xcite , is at present the favorite paradigm for explaining both the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) temperature anisotropies and the initial conditions for structure formation .",
    "indeed , it is during this epoch of accelerated expansion that the primordial density perturbations , which act as seeds for large - structure formation in the universe , are generated through the amplification of quantum fluctuations of the field(s )  @xcite . in the simplest inflationary models ,",
    "the energy density of the universe is dominated by a single scalar field @xmath1 , the so - called inflaton , that slowly rolls down its self - interaction potential .",
    "the recent publication of the three year results of the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap )  @xcite continues to support the standard inflationary predictions .",
    "wmap data provides no indication of any significant deviations from gaussianity and adiabaticity of the cmbr power spectrum and suggests that the universe is spatially flat to within the limits of observational accuracy .",
    "moreover , it allows for very accurate constraints on the spectral index ; the wmap three - year data ( wmap3 ) yield  @xcite @xmath2 at @xmath3 confidence level ( cl ) , for vanishing running and no tensor modes .",
    "this result is in agreement with the one previously obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath4 , using a joint analysis of the power spectrum of galaxy clustering measured from the final two - degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) and a pre - wmap3 compilation of measurements of both the temperature power spectrum and the temperature - polarization cross - correlation of the cmbr .",
    "a remarkable feature of these results is that the harrison - zeldovich scale - invariant spectrum seems to be ruled out at around @xmath5 level .",
    "another feature of wmap3 data is the evidence for a significant running of the scalar spectral index  @xcite , @xmath6 at @xmath3 cl and considering tensor perturbations .",
    "this evidence was already present in the wmap1 analysis @xcite and persists when large scale structure data is included  @xcite , although it is diluted by the addition of lyman-@xmath7 forest data  @xcite .",
    "we should note however that zero running is at about @xmath8 from the central value and hence wmap3 does not demand a nonvanishing running .",
    "in fact , vanishing running is still a good fit to the cmbr data , and the improvement of the @xmath9 is small ( @xmath10 ) , if running is allowed .",
    "notice also that if both tensor modes and running are taken into account , the wmap team obtained @xmath11 as the best fit value for the scalar tilt .    on the theoretical side , motivated by developments in string / m - theory ,",
    "there has been considerable interest in the so - called braneworld constructions , where the matter fields are trapped in a lower dimensional brane , while ( in the simplest models ) only gravity can propagate into the bulk .",
    "of special interest for cosmology is the randall - sundrum ii ( rsii ) construction  @xcite , consisting of a single brane with positive tension embedded in a 5-dimensional bulk with a negative cosmological constant ( anti - de sitter spacetime ) .",
    "a remarkable feature of the rsii brane cosmology ( bc ) is the modification of the expansion rate of the universe , @xmath12 , before the nucleosynthesis era  @xcite . while in standard cosmology the expansion rate scales with the energy density @xmath13 as @xmath14 , this dependence becomes @xmath15 at very high energies in brane cosmology .",
    "this behavior may have important consequences on early universe phenomena such as inflation  @xcite and the generation of the baryon asymmetry  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we study the rsii braneworld inflationary period in the light of wmap3 results , for a single - field power - law inflaton potential of the form  @xcite @xmath16 here @xmath17 ( unbroken symmetry ) or @xmath18 ( broken symmetry ) and @xmath19 . the parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 are dimensionless constants ; @xmath20 must be positive in order to ensure the stability of the potential , while @xmath21 can have either sign .",
    "this potential has been studied previously in the literature in the sc context  @xcite and covers a wide class of inflationary scenarios : for both spontaneously broken and unbroken ( negative and positive mass square term , respectively ) potentials one can obtain small and large - field inflation ( hereafter also called new and chaotic inflationary solutions , respectively ) .",
    "monomial potentials have already been widely studied both in standard cosmology ( for a recent update following wmap3 data see refs .",
    "@xcite ) and in the braneworld context  @xcite ; these can be regarded as particular cases of the one considered here .",

    "a reasonable assumption is to set the global minimum of the potential to zero .",

    "however , this is still consistent with observation , since the evidence for running is still weak and it can evaporate as more data becomes available .",
    "in fact , the addition of lyman-@xmath7 forest data reduces the need for a negative value of @xmath186  @xcite .",
    "recently easther @xmath187 peiris  @xcite have analyzed the implications of a large running spectral index for single - field slow - roll inflation in sc , using the inflationary flow equations  @xcite and retaining all terms in @xmath186 up to quadratic order in the slow - roll parameters .",
    "they found that , for all parameter choices consistent with a large negative running , inflation lasts less than 30 e - folds after cmbr scales leave the horizon .",
    "they concluded that a definitive observation of a large negative running would imply that inflationary stage requires multiple fields or the breakdown of slow - roll .",
    "the underlying conclusions of their work can presumably be carried over to the bc case , as the flow equations are quite insensitive to the expansion dynamics  @xcite .",
    "however , one should notice , as shown in  @xcite , that the flow equation approach does not directly incorporate inflationary dynamics .",
    "in fact , one can determine analytically the set of inflationary potentials which correspond to solutions of the truncated flow equations .",
    "hence , conclusions obtained from an analysis based on the flow equations should be considered with some care , since it is certainly possible to find potential shapes that are not represented by the set of inflationary potentials for which the formalism is valid .",
