    "this suggests the presence of short - ranged order above the bulk three - dimensional ordering which occurs at @xmath17 .",

    "magnetic susceptibility measurements provide evidence that the ir atoms carry effective @xmath12 moments and they have strong antiferromagnetic interactions as evidenced by a large and negative weiss temperature @xmath85  k. the magnetic susceptibility is slightly anisotropic with @xmath87 being the easy axis of magnetization .",

    "it is difficult to decide the ordering direction from our measurements .",
    "the reduction in the absolute value of @xmath4 is larger for @xmath117 but the change of slope at @xmath17 is stronger for @xmath118 .    a much smaller @xmath17 compared to the wiess temperature @xmath119  k indicates frustrated magnetic interactions in na@xmath0iro@xmath1 .",

    "the presence of short - ranged magnetic order is also supported by our heat capacity measurements .",

    "an incorrect estimation of the lattice contribution to @xmath15 can lead to a reduced @xmath109 .",
    "however , if we estimate the entropy by integrating the total @xmath122 versus @xmath5 data without any lattice subtraction , we still end up with only @xmath123  30%rln(2 ) at @xmath17 suggesting that the reduced entropy is intrinsic to na@xmath0iro@xmath1 and most likely occurs due to the developement of short - ranged magnetic order well above @xmath17 .",
    "there has been a lot of recent theoretical interest in na@xmath0iro@xmath1 with suggestions of a topological band insulator@xcite or a magnetically ordered mott insulator@xcite being possible ground states for this system .",
    "our electrical transport results indicate insulating behavior consistent with the above predictions . however ,",
    "our magnetic measurements indicate local moment magnetism and long - range antiferromagnetic ordering which is not consistent with the topological band insulator picture above .",
