    "in recent years there has been an increasing interest in derivative securities at the interface of finance and insurance . _ structured products _ such as risk bonds , asset - backed securities and weather derivatives are end - products of a process known as _ securitization _ that transforms non - tradable risk factors into tradable financial assets . developed in the u.s .",
    "mortgage markets , the idea of pooling and underwriting risk that can not be hedged through investments in the capital markets alone has long become a key factor driving the convergence of insurance and financial markets .",
    "structured products are often written on non - tradable underlyings , tailored to the issuers specific needs and traded `` over the counter '' .",
    "insurance companies , for instance , routinely sell weather derivatives or risk bonds to customers that can not go to the capital markets directly and/or seek financial securities with low correlation with stock indices as additions to diversified portfolios .",
    "the market for such claims is generally incomplete and illiquid . as a result",
    ", many of the standard paradigms of traditional derivative pricing theory , including replication arguments do not apply to structured products . in an illiquid market framework ,",
    "preference - based valuation principles that take into account characteristics and endowment of trading partners may be more appropriate for designing , pricing and hedging contingent claims .",
    "such valuation principles have become a major topic of current research in economics and financial mathematics .",
    "they include rules of pareto optimal risk allocation ( @xcite , @xcite ) , market completion and dynamic equilibrium pricing ( @xcite , @xcite ) and , in particular , utility indifference arguments ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , ... ) .",
    "the latter assumes a high degree of market asymmetry . for indifference valuation to be a _ pricing _ rather than _ valuation _ principle , the demand for a financial security must come from identical agents with known preferences and negligible market impact while the supply must come from a single principal .",
    "when the demand comes from heterogeneous individuals with hidden characteristics , indifference arguments do not always yield an appropriate pricing scheme .    in this paper",
    "we move away from the assumption of investor homogeneity and allow for heterogeneous agents .",
    "we consider a single principal with a random endowment whose goal is to lay off some of her risk with heterogeneous agents by designing and selling derivative securities on her income .",
    "the agents have mean variance preferences .",
    "an agent s degree of risk aversion is private information and hidden to the principal .",
    "the principal only knows the distribution of risk aversion coefficients which puts her at an informational disadvantage .",
    "if all the agents were homogeneous , the principal , when offering a structured product to a single agent , could ( perhaps ) extract the indifference ( maximum ) price from each trading partner . in the presence of agent heterogeneity",
    "this is no longer possible , either because the agents would hide their characteristics from the principal or prefer another asset offered by the principal but designed and priced for another customer .",
    "the problem of optimal derivative design in a principal - agent framework with informed agents and an uninformed principal has first been addressed in a recent paper by of carlier , ekeland and touzi @xcite . with the agents being the informed party ,",
    "theirs is a screening model .",
    "the literature on screening within the adverse selection framework can be traced back to mussa and rosen @xcite , where both the principal s allocation rule and the agents types are one - dimensional",
    ". armstrong @xcite relaxes the hypothesis of agents being characterized by a single parameter .",
    "he shows that , unlike the one - dimensional case ,  bunching \" of the first type is robust when the types of the agents are multi - dimensional . in their seminal paper , rochet and chon @xcite",
    "further extend this analysis .",
    "they provide a characterization of the contracts , determined by the ( non - linear ) pricing schedule , that maximize the principal s utility under the constraints imposed by the asymmetry of information in the models .",
    "building on their work , carlier , ekeland and touzi @xcite study a principal - agent model of optimal derivative design where the agents preferences are of mean - variance type and their multi - dimensional types characterize their risk aversions and initial endowments .",
    "they assume that there is a direct cost to the principal when she designs a contract for an agent , and that the principal s aim is to maximize profits .",
    "we start from a similar set - up , but substitute the idea that providing products carries a cost for the idea that traded contracts expose the principal to additional risk - as measured by a convex risk measure - in exchange for a known revenue .",
    "this may be viewed as a partial extension of the work by barrieu and el karoui ( @xcite,@xcite ) to an incomplete information framework .",
    "the principal s aim is to minimize her risk exposure by trading with the agents subject to the standard incentive compatibility and individual rationality conditions on the agents choices . in order to prove that the principal s risk minimization problem has a solution we first follow the seminal idea of rochet and chon @xcite and characterize incentive compatible catalogues in terms of @xmath0-convex functions .",
    "when the impact of a single trade on the principal s revenues is linear as in carlier , ekeland and touzi @xcite , the link between incentive compatibility and @xmath0-convexity is key to establish the existence of an optimal solution . in our model",
    "the impact is non - linear as a single trade has a non - linear impact on the principal s risk assessment . due to this non - linearity",
    "we face a non - standard variational problem where the objective can not be written as the integral of a given lagrangian . instead",
    ", our problem can be decomposed into a standard variational part representing the aggregate income of the principal , plus the minimization of the principal s risk evaluation , which depends on the aggregate of the derivatives traded .",
    "we state sufficient conditions that guarantee that the principal s optimization problem has a solution and illustrate the effect of risk transfer on her exposure by means of two specific examples .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ setup ]",
    "we formulate our principal - agent model and state the main result . the proof is given in section [ main ] . in section [ sec - examples ]",
    "we illustrate the effects of risk transfer on the principal s position by two examples . in the first we consider a situation where the principal restricts itself to type - dependent multiples of some benchmark claim .",
    "this case can be solved in closed form by means of a standard variational problem .",
    "the second example considers put options with type - dependent strikes . in both cases",
    "we assume that the principal s risk measure is average value at risk . as a consequence",
    "the risk minimization problem can be stated in terms of a min - max problem ; we provide an efficient numerical scheme for approximating the optimal solution .",
    "the code is given in an appendix .",
    "we consider an economy with a single _ principal _ whose income @xmath1 is exposed to non - hedgeable risk factors rising from , e.g. , climate or weather phenomena .",

    "the principal knows the distribution @xmath8 of types but not the realizations of the random variables @xmath6 .",

    "a catalogue @xmath15 will be called _ incentive compatible _",
    "( * ic * ) if the agent s interests are best served by revealing her type .",
    "this means that her optimal utility is achieved by the security @xmath18 : @xmath19    we assume that each agent has some outside option ( `` no trade '' ) that yields a utility of zero .",
    "a catalogue is thus called _ individually rational _ ( * ir * )",
    "if it yields at least the reservation utility for all agents , i.e. , if @xmath20    by offering only incentive compatible contracts , the principal forces the agents to reveal their type .",
    "offering contracts where the ir constraint is binding allows the principal to exclude undesirable agents from participating in the market .",
    "it can be shown that under certain conditions , the interests of the principal are better served by keeping agents of  lower types \" to their reservation utility ; rochet and chon @xcite have shown that in higher dimensions this is always the case .    if the principal issues the catalogue @xmath21 , she receives a cash amount of @xmath22 and is subject to the additional liability @xmath23 she evaluates the risk associated with her overall position @xmath24 via a coherent and law - invariant risk measure @xmath25 that has the fatou property .",
