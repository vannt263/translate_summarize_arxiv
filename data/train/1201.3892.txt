    "the speed - up is by comparison with a no - feedback measurement , which can be completely understood classically ( see below ) .",

    "our main results are the observation of different factors for the speed - up ( relative to a single measurement in the eigenbasis of the qubit state ) , of 4 and 2 , depending on how the purification speed is quantified . in the first case it is in terms of the time when the average system purity , @xmath273 , reaches certain purity level @xmath3",

    "both of these speed - ups can be understood via the possibility to `` split '' the three detector measurement at each measurement time step into three equivalent measurements  one parallel to the state ( in the bloch sphere sense ) and the remaining two perpendicular to the state  which is one of the consequences of isotropy of the qubit evolution in the bloch space .",
    "for the first measure of purification time these correspond to one `` bad '' and two `` good '' measurements ( giving speed - up contributions of @xmath274 and @xmath275 respectively , totalling 4 ) . for the second measure , they correspond to one `` good '' and two  bad  measurements ( giving speed - up contributions of @xmath276 and @xmath277 respectively , totalling 2 ) .    for a measurement with non - ideal detectors ,",
    "the dynamics remains isotropic in the bloch space .",
    "moreover , the classification to `` good '' and `` bad '' measurements remains the same , as long as the detector inefficiency @xmath95 is not greater than @xmath272 .",
    "the inefficiency causes an increase in the purification times , that scales as a function of the ratio of inefficiency over impurity , @xmath15 , in the high - purity and high - efficiency limit , @xmath200 , @xmath116 . here",
