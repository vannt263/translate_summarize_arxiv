    "the following expression of @xmath90 is useful : @xmath91 before describing our three approaches , we recall the following classical definition ( see  @xcite ) :    [ def : g - conv ] let @xmath92 be an open bounded smooth subdomain of @xmath4 . a family of matrix - valued functions @xmath93 is said to @xmath13-converge in @xmath92 to a matrix - valued function @xmath94 if , for all @xmath95 , the family @xmath96 of solutions to @xmath97 satisfies @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the unique solution to the homogenized equation @xmath100      to gain some intuition , we first recast   as @xmath101 = 0 \\quad \\mbox { in } \\quad { \\mathcal{d}}'({\\mathbb r}^d ) , \\ ] ] where @xmath102 is the characteristic function of @xmath34 .",
    "thus , in this problem , the quantity @xmath103 can be seen as a local perturbation to the homogeneous exterior medium characterized by the diffusion coefficient @xmath6 . in turn",
    ", @xmath80 can be seen as the perturbation of an incident plane wave with wavevector @xmath104 induced by the defect located in @xmath34 .",
    "this is somehow reminiscent of the classical eshelby problem  @xcite .",
    "a first idea is to choose a constant exterior matrix such that the scattering energy of the perturbation of the wave is as small as possible .",
    "we have the following result ( recall that @xmath105 is defined by  ):",
    "it follows that , for any @xmath33 , there exists ( at least ) one matrix @xmath107 such that @xmath108 this matrix @xmath109 can be seen as a matrix which minimizes the scattering energy induced by the defect @xmath110 of incident plane waves in an infinite medium . indeed , using",
    ", we have that @xmath111 and the matrix @xmath109 can thus be seen as a diffusion matrix @xmath6 of the exterior medium such that the sum of the energies of the scattering waves with incident wavevectors @xmath112 induced by the defect is minimum .",
    "we now introduce a second alternative definition of an approximate homogenized matrix : @xmath113 where @xmath109 is defined by  . in view of",
    ", the above relation can also be written as @xmath114 using  , the above definition can formally be recast as @xmath115 the above relation is formal in the sense that both sides of the equation are infinite , but it nevertheless has an interesting physical interpretation .",
    "the above left - hand side corresponds to the energy of the heterogeneous material , modelled by @xmath50 in @xmath34 and @xmath109 outside of @xmath34 , and where the field @xmath116 is solution to the equilibrium equation  .",
    "since @xmath117 is in @xmath118 , its average is thought to vanish , and hence the average field is @xmath104 .",
    "the above right - hand side corresponds to the energy of a material , modelled by @xmath119 in @xmath34 and @xmath109 outside of @xmath34 , in which the field is uniform and equal to @xmath104 .",
    "the formal equation   thus `` defines '' @xmath119 by an equality in terms of energies .",
    "we eventually introduce a third alternative definition , inspired by the approximation of @xmath21 introduced in  @xcite .",
    "assume that , for any @xmath33 , there exists a matrix @xmath123 such that @xmath124 such a matrix formally satisfies the self - consistent equation @xmath125   \\\\",

    "\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] this third definition also yields a converging approximation of @xmath21 :    [ prop : prop2 ] assume that the matrix field @xmath50 satisfies assumption  [ hyp : g - conv ] , and that there exists a sequence @xmath126 satisfying @xmath127 for some increasing sequence @xmath128 of positive numbers converging to @xmath129 . then , @xmath130    note that we do not assume in this proposition that the fixed point equation   has a solution for _ all _ radii @xmath0 .",
    "proving the existence of a matrix @xmath131 satisfying   in the general case is a delicate question .",
