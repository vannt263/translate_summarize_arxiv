    "however , we do not know much because the equations of motion ( eom ) are difficult to solve ; the eom for extended objects are partial differential equations ( pdes ) while those for particles are ordinary differential equations ( odes ) . even in the case of strings , where eom are written as pdes of two dimensions",

    "the dashed lines represent @xmath194 slices .",
    "the solid lines represent @xmath196 slices , which also represent the foliating orbits of type @xmath1332 .",
    "the jagged line is a singular orbit of dimension one with @xmath197 , which corresponds to the ` cosmological singularity ' of the intrinsic geometry . ]    from eqs . , and , the metric induced on the world - volume is written as @xmath198 where we have chosen the parameterization of @xmath67 so that @xmath199 the geometry on the world - volume is analogous to the flat friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker universe . at the null line @xmath197 on the world - volume , i.e. , @xmath200 , @xmath201 , the scalar curvature of the induced metric diverges .",
    "thus , the ` cosmological singularity ' is described by the null line @xmath197 .",
    "the orbits and generated by the killing vectors are two - dimensional spacelike surface , but is null line at @xmath197",
    ". therefore the ` cosmological singularity ' is described by the singular orbit .",
    "we remark that the orbit is singular at @xmath202 but the world - volume itself is smooth everywhere except at the origin of minkowski spacetime .",
    "the embedding of the membrane is very similar to that of the brane universe in five - dimensional anti - de sitter space @xcite .",
    "we have investigated the dynamics of cohomogeneity one membranes .",
    "the three - dimensional world - volume of the cohomogeneity one membrane is foliated by two - dimensional orbits of the symmetry group @xmath4 that is a subgroup of the isometry group , @xmath16 , of the spacetime @xmath0 .",
    "the symmetry suggests that the equations of motion are reduced to ordinary differential equations .",
    "we have explicitly shown that the nambu - goto equations are reduced to the geodesic equations in the orbit space , or the quotient space @xmath5 , with a properly defined metric thereon .    in a highly symmetric spacetime ,",
    "there exist a variety of symmetry groups @xmath4 that allow two - dimensional orbits .",
    "we have proposed a classification of the symmetry groups @xmath4 under the idea that the orbits of @xmath4 are equivalent if they are connected by an isometry of @xmath0 .",
    "this leads to the classification of the conjugacy classes of @xmath4 in @xmath16 .",
    "the classification is reduced to that of pairs and triples of killing vectors which form a lie algebra .",
    "we have presented a concrete procedure of the classification .",
    "we have demonstrated the procedure in minkowski spacetime and have achieved the complete classification of cohomogeneity one membranes ( tables  [ table : result-2dim - comm ] , [ table : result-2dim - sol ] and [ table : result-3dim ] ) .",
    "the symmetry group @xmath4 must be of two or three dimensions in order to have a two - dimensional orbits .",
    "in minkowski spacetime , there are two cases for @xmath203 : the abelian group and the non - abelian group ; and four cases for @xmath204 : bianchi type @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath112 and @xmath141 .",
    "the orbits in the latter four cases are two - dimensional maximally symmetric timelike or spacelike surfaces . in addition , because @xmath4 is a subgroup of @xmath16 , the embeddings of the orbits should be homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "it is interesting that while bianchi type @xmath108 , @xmath112 and @xmath141 allow , up to geometric equivalence , a unique foliation by the orbits , bianchi type @xmath109 allows two inequivalent foliations by intrinsically flat orbits .",
    "one is the flat embedding ( type @xmath1331 ) and the other is an extrinsically curved one ( type @xmath1332 ) .    for the membrane of type @xmath1332 , we have constructed an exact solution .",
    "the solution describes a @xmath12-dimensional analog of the flat friedman - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) universe embedded in minkowski spacetime .",
    "the cosmological singularity is represented by a null line on the world - volume .",
    "the embedding is similar to that of the flat flrw brane universe in the five - dimensional anti - de sitter spacetime @xcite .",
    "our method is general and can be applied to a higher - dimensional extended object in an arbitrary spacetime .",
    "the equations of motion of an extended object becomes a geodesic equations on the orbit space @xmath5 . as seen in an example of this article",
    ", the solution of the geodesic equations may correspond to a non - trivial configuration of membrane .",
    "therefore the concept of cohomogeneity one objects will be helpful to understand the dynamics of extended objects in spacetime .",
    "this work is supported by the grant - in - aid for scientific research no.19540305 and 24540282 .",
    "we give simple representatives of equivalence classes in @xmath205 , which consists of pairs of commuting killing vectors @xmath25 , where @xmath110 is in the canonical form of type i , i.e. , @xmath206 in the case of @xmath207 and @xmath208 , the general form of @xmath111 which commutes with @xmath110 is simply @xmath209 where @xmath210 , @xmath211 and @xmath212 are constants .",
    "we require @xmath213 so that @xmath110 and @xmath111 are linearly independent . or @xmath214 , the general form of @xmath111 is more complicated . for the sake of simplicity , we concentrate on the case @xmath215 . ]    by virtue of the equivalence under @xmath216 action , we can reduce the form of @xmath25 to a simple one . for @xmath111 satisfying eq .",
    ", we have @xmath217 where @xmath218 is a constant determined by @xmath158 , @xmath159 , @xmath210 , @xmath211 and @xmath212 .",
    "otherwise , for @xmath219 , we have @xmath220    for further reduction of the pair , we take an isometry @xmath221 generated by @xmath222 , namely lorentz boost for @xmath15 direction . the killing vector @xmath223 is transformed to @xmath224 choosing the parameter @xmath225 so that @xmath226 we can reduce the form of the pair to @xmath227 in the case @xmath228 , @xmath229 is invariant under the lorentz boost @xmath221 . using @xmath216 action again , we have three kinds of representatives , @xmath230 we should note that the pair is included in the second case of",
