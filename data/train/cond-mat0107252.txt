    "investigating of superconducting proximity effect in normal systems has a long history back to the experiments of mcmillan and rowell@xcite .",
    "their tunneling spectroscopy measurements in normal metals connected to a superconductor revealed strong modifications of the density of states ( dos ) caused by the induced superconducting correlations .",
    "these results were understood in the tunneling model of mcmillan@xcite .",
    "he first noted that the changes in the dos of the normal metal occur on a scale @xmath0 , which in his model is identified with inverse escape time of a quasi - particle in the normal metal .",
    "naively , one would have expected @xmath1 , the superconducting gap parameter , to play the dominant role , which turned out to be not the case .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath2 , the energy gap in the superconductor plays no role at all and the dos in the normal metal has a gap of the order of @xmath0 .",
    "we can understand these observations by noting that in clean normal metal films the electronic properties are determined by so called andreev bound states @xcite .",
    "these are bound electron - hole pairs living on trajectories , which start and end at the superconductor .",
    "the characteristic energy scale in this case is @xmath3 , again the inverse escape time . in recent years experiments",
    "became possible , in which the density of states was resolved _",
    "locally _ on a sub-@xmath4 m scale .",
    "for example , the dependence of the tunneling dos on the distance from the superconductor in normal metals has been measured by guron _",
    "et al._@xcite using additional tunnel junctions .",
    "these results have been successfully explained within the quasi - classical theory in the diffusive limit.@xcite other experiments made use of low temperature scanning tunneling microscopes to resolve spatially the dos of small droplets of normal metal on the surface of a superconductor.@xcite nowadays these types of experiments are becoming a standard technique.@xcite    the question of the proximity effect in the presence of a spin splitting is currently heavily investigated . in particular the influence of a superconductor on transport properties of a ferromagnet is under debate@xcite , in which case the proximity effect is negligible .",
    "it is , however , natural to address the question of the influence of an exchange field on the proximity density of states .",
    "in fact , this question was already addressed experimentally a while ago by gallagher _",
    "they observed a spin splitting of the dos in thin normal layers in a parallel magnetic field .",
    "new experimental developments,@xcite exploring the proximity effect on a nanometer scale demand new theoretical models , beyond the simple tunneling model of mcmillan . in the present paper",
    "we investigate a new model , suitable for these experiments .",
    "the motivation stems not only from fundamental question of the coexistence of ferromagnetism and superconductivity , but also because interesting applications of ferromagnet - superconductor ( fs ) hybrid structures have been proposed .",
    "we only mention here the potential use of sfs - contacts in the construction of quantum computers .",
    "sfs - junctions are candidates for all - electronic @xmath5-junction , which are needed in some proposals for solid - state qubits .",
    "@xcite    we also note , that many surprising effects in normal metal - superconductor heterostructures have been found , both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "the question , how these effects are modified by the presence of ferromagnetism , is of high interest .",
    "for example , making use of mechanically controlled break junctions , the conduction channel content of single atoms has been determined @xcite .",
    "these were shown to depend on the chemistry of the atom only@xcite .",
    "it was however crucial to have superconducting contacts in these experiments .",
    "therefore , so far only superconducting elements or normal metals , with the help of the proximity effect , have been investigated.@xcite it is reasonable to expect that experiments with ferromagnetic materials will be performed in the near future .",
    "long time ago larkin and ovchinnikov @xcite and fulde and ferrel @xcite independently predicted , that in the presence of an exchange field @xmath6 ( for instance in magnetic superconductors ) a specific superconducting state can be formed , in which cooper pairs have a non - zero momentum due to spin splitting .",
    "the momentum of cooper pairs is given by @xmath7 , which , in the singlet state , results from the difference between up and down spin band fermi momenta .",
    "the resulting loff state is qualitatively different from the homogeneous zero - momentum state . due to a varying superconducting phase",
    ", the order parameter has an oscillatory spatial modulation containing nodes , in which the phase changes by @xmath5 .",
    "the loff state has never been observed in bulk superconductor , but there are recently evidences for detecting an induced loff state in heterostructures of ferromagnets and superconductors .",
    "many works have investigated the thermodynamics properties of fs - multilayers .",
    "et al._@xcite have predicted oscillation of the superconducting critical temperature @xmath8 as a function of the thickness of the attached f - layer .",
    "the experimental evidence for these @xmath8 oscillations is not , however , conclusive.@xcite the reason for this may , for example , result from a bad quality of the fs - interface.@xcite    the most recent experiments have concentrated on other properties of fs - layers .",
    "@xcite measured the temperature dependence of the critical current in sfs josephson junctions with thin f - layer and have found a non - monotonic temperature dependence .",
    "this behavior can be understood in terms of a @xmath5 phase shift due to the exchange field , which occurs for certain values of the thickness of the f - layer , as first was predicted by bulaevskii _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "an indirect proof of the @xmath5 phase shift has been made by kontos _",
    "et al._,@xcite , who studied the density of states in thin ferromagnetic films contacted by a superconductor .",
    "they observed an oscillatory behavior of the induced superconducting correlation for layers of different thickness , which was attributed to influence of the exchange field . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have shown that these experimental findings could be explained by a model of a ballistic ferromagnetic layer with rough boundaries .",
    "the best agreement was obtained in the limit of large @xmath9 and small interface transparency @xmath10 .    in the present paper ,",
    "we study the proximity dos in a clean ferromagnetic layer on top of a superconductor in the full parameter range . within the ballistic quasi - classical formalism",
    "we obtain , that the dos for energies below the superconducting gap @xmath1 is completely specified by the length distribution of the classical trajectories inside the ferromagnet ( sec .",

    "we analyze the dos for different regimes of @xmath9 .",
    "it shows the interplay between ferromagnetism and superconductivity depending qualitatively on the thickness @xmath11 .",
    "for example , a weak exchange field leads to a spin - splitting of the dos , which results in a distinctive low energy peak in the total dos .",
    "in addition there is an overall suppression of the superconducting features of the dos with increasing @xmath6 . at higher exchange fields ,",
    "the dos shows as a signature of the exchange splitting an oscillatory behavior as a function of the layer thickness .",

    "[ zbnfig4 ] we plotted @xmath137 for @xmath138 at different @xmath97 .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ zbnfig4]-iiia the suppression of the superconducting features from dos by increasing @xmath97 is faster than in the weak ferromagnetic cases .",
    "in fact the dos reaches almost to the normal state value for @xmath139 . as long as @xmath140 , mainly long trajectories of @xmath141 contribute to the zero energy dos , which are well approximated by an exponential distribution of the form @xmath142 . replacing this approximation form of @xmath57 into the general expression of dos eq .",
    "( [ eq : dosb ] ) we find , that the zero energy dos increases with @xmath100 roughly as @xmath143 this results is also applicable for the weak ferromagnetic case discussed above . as before , the shifting of the ap to lower energies ( see fig .",
    "[ zbnfig4]-iiib ) leads to the formation of zeap at the fermi level as is seen from fig .",

    ". then the dos develops coherent oscillation as a function of @xmath134 with the period @xmath135 .",
    "the amplitude and the sign of the oscillation depend on energy .",
    "maximal amplitudes of opposite sign always occur at zero energy or at the gap energy ( see fig .",
    "[ zbnfig4]-iiid ) .",
    "this results in an inverted energy dependence of the dos by changing @xmath11 , which has been observed in the experiment @xcite .",
    "we have shown in @xcite that our results is in a quantitative agreement with the experimental data .      summarizing the above analysis we present a map showing the dependence of dos on @xmath97 and @xmath144 for small fs - interface transparency .",
    "this map is shown in fig .",
    "[ zbnfig5 ] .",
    "various regions in the map are distinguished by different ranges of @xmath9 and @xmath99 ( or equivalently @xmath100 ) . along the diagonal lines",
    "@xmath6 is equal to @xmath1 and moving upwards @xmath123 ( and consequently @xmath100 ) increases .",
    "the quarter circles are curves with constant @xmath105 , along which the ratio @xmath9 is varying . in the following we discuss different regions according to this classification .",
    "the normal film corresponds to the vertical axis ( @xmath12 ) , which consists of three parts .",
    "the first part is limited by @xmath145 . here",
    "the superconducting features are dominant at lower @xmath97 and suppressed for @xmath146 , showing a minigap at the fermi level .",
    "the second part is limited by @xmath147 , where the main feature is the first ap at energies @xmath148 and a minigap of order @xmath126 .",
    "close to the boundary @xmath149 the second ap appears in the dos . finally , the third part is the region @xmath150 , where the dos contains many ap , appearing as small deviations ( proportional to @xmath10 ) from the normal state dos .    in the case of a ferromagnetic film",
    "we distinguish the following regions :    1 .",
    "the strongly superconducting region is limited by the smallest quarter circle , in which the superconducting features are dominate the dos . at non - zero @xmath6",
    "the zero energy dos appears at larger @xmath151 and the dos increases to the value of the normal state in the domain close to the second quarter circle boundary . for the part @xmath94",
    ", there is a smooth maximum at @xmath103 between two minima at @xmath18 .",
    "for @xmath95 we have only a smooth peak at @xmath103 .",
    "the intermediate regions limited by two quarter circles . in @xmath94 part the main features in dos is the existence of two dips at @xmath15 and the first ap .",
    "close to the second boundary we observe a separation between two energy domains @xmath128 and @xmath129 . while the second ap peaks appears at energies above @xmath6 , the first ap peaks move to energies below @xmath6 domain . in the @xmath95 part",
    "the dos has a smooth peak at @xmath103 . in the domain close to the diagonal line @xmath152",
    ", there are also two resonance sharp peaks at @xmath15 which disappear in @xmath153 regions . in both cases of @xmath94 and @xmath95 ,",
    "shifting of the aps leads to the formation of a zeap .",
    "this happens at regions close to the third quarter circle .",
    "+   and @xmath154 for a small fs - interface transparency @xmath155 . in the case of high transparency",
    "@xmath84 the region between @xmath156 and @xmath157 is absent.,width=529 ] 3 .   in the region above the third quarter circle",
    "the dos is close to the normal state value ( flat ) .",
    "there are , however , small deviations proportional to @xmath10 , which have different origins in the different domains . in the limiting domains of @xmath158 and @xmath96 ( close to the respective axis ) they consist of many ap and the oscillations , respectively .",
    "in the @xmath94 part there are many ap above @xmath6 and an oscillatory variation below @xmath6 . in the @xmath95 part and for weak exchange fields in subgap part we have oscillatory variations with an energy dependent sign and amplitude , which result from a collective shift of many ap . as the intermediate region the resonance peaks are present at @xmath18 . in the strong exchange field part",
    "these peaks are disappear . here",
    "the oscillations of subgap dos are produced by the first ap only .",
    "the dos map for the case of high transparency @xmath84 is similar to fig .",
    "[ zbnfig5 ] .",
    "the difference is the absence of the region between @xmath156 and @xmath157 on both axis . in the remaining regions we have features similar to the @xmath92 case .",
    "the value of the minigap and the energy of first ap are the same order .",
    "all features and variations including ap and oscillations are more pronounced than the @xmath92 case .",
    "in summary , we have studied theoretically superconducting proximity effect in ballistic ferromagnetic layers . within the quasi - classical formalism , we have obtained expressions for the density of states at all energies in a ferromagnetic metal in contact with a superconductor which are completely specified by fourier transform of the length distribution of classical trajectories in the ferromagnet .",
    "the length distribution of trajectories depends only on the geometrical properties of the attached ferromagnet and the connected interfaces .",
    "thus , the obtained expressions are applicable for ballistic fs structures of arbitrary geometry .",
    "we have calculated the length distribution for the film geometry in a quasi - ballistic model taking into account finite transparency of the fs interface , roughness at the film boundaries and weak bulk disorders .",
    "the density of states exhibits variety of structures depending on the values of the superconducting energy gap @xmath1 , the ferromagnet exchange field @xmath6 , the thickness of f film @xmath11 and the fs interface transparency @xmath10 .",
    "we have observed many interesting features , like splitting of the subgap density of states for spin up and spin down quasi - particles , a zero energy andreev peak , resonant transmission peaks above the gap at @xmath18 and oscillations of the dos as a function of the film thickness .",
    "these effects have been explained in terms of the phase shift of andreev bound states , caused by the exchange field .",
