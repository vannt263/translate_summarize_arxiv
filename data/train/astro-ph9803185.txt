    "starbursts are sites of intense star - formation that occur in the ` circum - nuclear ' ( kpc - scale ) regions of galaxies , and dominate the integrated emission from the ` host ' galaxy ( cf .",
    "leitherer et al 1991 ) .",
    "the implied star - formation rates are so high that the existing gas supply may sustain the starburst for only a small fraction of a hubble time ( in agreement with detailed models of the observed properties of starbursts , which imply typical burst ages of - order 10@xmath3 years ) . both optical objective prism searches and the iras survey have shown that starbursts are major components of the local universe ( cf .",
    "huchra 1977 ; gallego et al et al 1995 ; soifer et al 1987 ) . indeed , integrated over the local universe , the total rate of ( high - mass ) star - formation in circumnuclear starbursts is comparable to the rate in the disks of spiral galaxies ( heckman 1997 ; gallego et al 1995 ; tresse & maddux 1998 ) .",
    "thus , starbursts deserve to be understood in their own right .    starbursts are even more important when placed in the broader context of contemporary stellar and extragalactic astrophysics .",
    "the cosmological relevance of starbursts has been dramatically underscored by one of the most spectacular discoveries in years : the existence of a population of high - redshift ( z @xmath4 2 ) star - forming field galaxies ( cf .",
    "steidel et al 1996 ; lowenthal et al 1997 ) .",
    "the sheer number density of these galaxies implies that they almost certainly represent precursors of typical present - day galaxies in an early actively - star - forming phase .",
    "this discovery therefore moves the study of the star - forming history of the universe into the arena of direct observations ( madau et al 1996 ) , and gives added impetus to the quest to understand local starbursts .",
    "observations in the vacuum - uv spectral regime are crucial for both understanding local starbursts , and for relating them to galaxies at high - redshift .",
    "this is the spectral regime where we can most clearly observe the direct spectroscopic signatures of the hot stars that provide most of the bolometric luminosity of starbursts ( e.g. sekiguchi & anderson 1987 ; fanelli , oconnell , & thuan 1988 ; leitherer , robert , & heckman 1995 ) .",
    "moreover , the vacuum - uv contains a wealth of spectral features , including the resonance transitions of most cosmically - abundant ionic species ( cf .",
    "morton 1991 ) .",
    "these give uv spectroscopy a unique capability for diagnosing the ( hot ) stellar population and the physical , chemical , and dynamical state of gas in starbursts .",
    "since ground - based optical observations of galaxies at high - redshifts sample the vacuum - uv portion of their rest - frame spectrum , we can not understand how galaxies evolved without documenting the vacuum - uv properties of galaxies in the present epoch .",
    "in particular , a thorough understanding of how to exploit the diagnostic power of the rest - frame uv spectral properties of local starbursts will give astronomers powerful tools with which to study star - formation and galaxy - evolution in the early universe .",
    "accordingly , we have undertaken an analysis of the vacuum - uv spectroscopic properties of a sample of 45 starburst and related galaxies in the local universe using the iue archives . in section 2",
    ", we describe our analysis of these data . in section 3",
    "we use the data to document the empirical vacuum - uv spectroscopic properties of local starbursts and to assess the dependence of these uv properties on crucial parameters like the dust content , metallicity , and luminosity of the starburst , and the mass and luminosity of the ` host galaxy ' .",
    "we will also describe how published analyses of hst uv spectra allow us to better understand the empirical results from the iue data , and in particular to ascertain the origin of the absorption features seen in the iue data ( stellar vs. interstellar ) . in section 4",
    ", we will interpret the results from section 3 , use these results to elucidate some of the properties of starbursts at high redshift , and point - out some potentially far - reaching implications .",
    "spectra of starbursts obtained with iue have some important advantages relative to hst spectra : 1 ) at present they cover a significantly larger sample of starbursts , and therefore better sample the multidimensional starburst parameter space .",
    "2 ) the projected size of the @xmath5 arcsec iue aperture is typically one to several kpc , and is therefore a good match to the circumnuclear sizes of these starbursts .",
    "it is also ( to within a factor of a few ) similar to the projected sizes of the apertures used to obtain spectra of high - redshift galaxies .",
    "in contrast , the typical hst apertures are about a factor 100 smaller in projected area and often cover selected ` pieces ' of the starburst ( e.g. individual ` super star clusters ' ) .",
    "however , iue data also have some serious disadvantages : 1 ) the iue resolution of 6 @xmath6 1200 km s@xmath7 is barely adequate to distinguish between stellar wind lines on the one hand , and stellar photospheric or interstellar lines on the other ( see section 3 below ) .",
    "2 ) the signal - to - noise in a typical iue spectrum is modest .    taken together , the above considerations mean that the iue data can document the empirical vacuum - uv spectral properties of a large sample of local starbursts , but we need to complement these data with hst spectra having better spectral resolution and signal - to- noise to understand the iue data and the starbursts themselves .",
    "fortunately , hst spectra of a small sample of starbursts have been published , and we can use these results for the above purposes .      using the atlas of kinney et al ( 1993 ) , we have compiled a sample of 45 starburst and star - forming galaxies that have iue swp spectra with a signal - to - noise of at least 10:1 in the continuum and for which metallicity information is available .",
    "while our sample is by no means a rigorously defined , statistically complete one , it does span a broad range in parameter space .",
    "more specifically , the sample covers a range in starburst bolometric luminosity from @xmath6 10@xmath8 l@xmath9 to @xmath10 l@xmath9 , starburst metallicity from 2% solar to almost three- times solar , and ` host ' galaxy velocity dispersion ( or rotation speed ) as measured with the hi @xmath1121 cm line ranging from 35 km s@xmath7 ( dwarf galaxies ) to 275 km s@xmath7 ( massive spirals and galactic mergers ) .",
    "the sample and its basic properties are listed in table 1 , grouped in into two sub - samples ordered by right - ascension .",
    "the first consists of the starbursts with metallicities less than 0.4 solar , while the second second comprises the starbursts with metallicity greater than 0.5 solar .",
    "the galaxy morphological type , heliocentric radial velocity ( @xmath12 ) , and foreground galactic extinction ( @xmath13 ) were all taken from the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) .",
    "a few values for @xmath14 ( denoted by an asterisk ) are based on the hi column densities from the survey of stark et al ( 1992 ) , assuming that @xmath15 corresponds to an hi column of 4.9 @xmath16 @xmath17 .",
    "the metallicities ( @xmath18 ) are given in terms of the oxygen abundance by number ( @xmath19 , where @xmath208.93 ) .",
    "further information about these metallicities ( including references ) are given in the table and its associated notes .",
    "with a few exceptions among the nearest galaxies , the distances adopted were calculated using the standard linear virgocentric infall model of schechter ( 1980 ) with parameters @xmath21 , @xmath22 km s@xmath7 , @xmath23 km s@xmath7 ( bingelli et al 1987 ) , and @xmath24 mpc ( i.e. @xmath25 km s@xmath7 mpc@xmath7 ) . the absolute blue magnitude ( @xmath26 )",
    "was calculated from the apparent magnitude ( also from ned ) corrected for galactic extinction ( see above ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath27 is the measured width of the galaxy s hi@xmath1121 cm emission - line ( huchtmeier & richter 1989 ) corrected for galaxy inclination using the optical ellipticity of the galaxy .",
    "this parameter is then approximately twice the galaxy rotation speed .",
    "it is a rough estimate only , since we have adopted a very simple inclination correction ( assuming the galaxies to be flat and axisymmetric ) and have ignored the role of turbulence or non - circular gas motions in broadening the hi profile .",
    "the far - ir luminosity ( @xmath28 ) was calculated from the ` fir ' parameter ( the flux between 40 and 120 microns ) published in the iras survey ( fullmer & lonsdale 1989 ) .",
    "the reduction of the raw iue data to produce the flux - calibrated set of iue spectra has been described in detail in kinney et al ( 1993 ) .",
    "we have further processed these spectra as follows .",
    "the spectra were first corrected for the effects of galactic extinction using the values of @xmath13 listed in table 1 and the standard milky way uv extinction curve ( seaton 1979 ; howarth 1983 ) .",
    "we have then used the galaxy systemic velocity given in table 1 to de - redshift each spectrum so that the corrected wavelength scale is in the rest - frame of the starburst .",
    "we have then treated the spectra as power - laws and measured the effective spectral index @xmath29 , where f@xmath30 .",
    "the fit for @xmath29 was performed over the spectral range between 1250 and 1850    using the iraf task curfit .",
    "technically , @xmath29 is an average value obtained after fitting a second - order legendre polynomial to a plot of log@xmath11 _ vs. _ log@xmath31 . to account for spectral features , which are mostly in absorption",
    ", we performed the fit iteratively with rejection thresholds set at -1.5@xmath32 and + 3@xmath32 .",
    "the major uncertainties in the values of @xmath29 come primarily from the fact that a power - law does not always provide a good fit to the data , probably due to line - blanketing in the spectra .",
    "therefore , to normalize each spectrum , we fit it with a series of four spline function segments and then divided the spectrum by the fit .",
    "the spline fits were done iteratively with the clipping values given above .",
    "the strengths of the principal uv spectral features were then measured automatically using the normalized , de - redshifted spectra and a standard set of spectral windows .",
    "the equivalent widths of the features were measured by integrating between two continuum points .",
    "these windows are as follows : siii@xmath111260 ( 1243 to 1269 ) , oi@xmath111302 plus siii@xmath111304 ( 1285 to 1312 ) , cii@xmath111335 ( 1321 to 1342 ) , siiv@xmath111397 ( 1378 to 1406 ) , civ@xmath111549 ( 1507 to 1553 ) .",
    "we note that the civ window includes the interstellar siii@xmath111526 line .",
    "these windows are broad enough to include foreground galactic contributions to the interstellar absorption features .",
    "unlike iue , hst spectra have adequate spectral resolutions to separate the galactic and intrinsic starburst absorption features .",
    "our examination of the hst uv spectra of 9 starburst galaxies shows that the mean equivalent widths of the galactic cii@xmath111335 , siii@xmath111260 , siiv@xmath111397 , and civ@xmath111549 lines are in the range 0.6 to 0.9 , with a dispersion of about a factor of two .",
    "these can be compared to the range of values seen in the iue starburst spectra of roughly 1 to 10 (see table 2 ) .",
    "we conclude that the foreground contamination of the measured starburst lines is typically only at the level of about 20% , and is a major contaminant ( @xmath4 50% ) only in a handful of the weakest - lined starbursts .",
    "the uncertainties in the absolute wavelength scale of the iue spectra are large ( @xmath33 km s@xmath7 ) , due primarily to the uncertain distribution of the uv light within the large iue aperture . also , the non - negligible contribution by foreground galactic gas will have more serious ( and distance - dependent ) consequences for the measured radial velocities .",
    "thus , we have not tried to measure radial velocities with these data .",
    "the iue data on most of the individual starbursts are rather noisy .",
    "thus , rather than listing the equivalent widths of all the above absorption - lines separately , we have grouped them into two categories .",
    "the first category consists of the strongest low - ionization features : those due to siii@xmath111260 , oi@xmath111302 plus si@xmath111304 , and cii@xmath111335 . as we will argue below ,",
    "these lines are almost entirely interstellar in origin , so we denote the average equivalent width of these features by w@xmath34 .",
    "the second category consists of the two high - ionization lines siiv@xmath111397 and civ@xmath111549 .",
    "again , we will argue below that these typically have a strong contribution from stellar winds ( although interstellar absorption can also be significant , and even dominate in some cases ) .",
    "we denote the average equivalent width of these features by w@xmath35 .",
    "these results of our analysis are listed in table 2 .",
    "we parameterize the uv luminosity by @xmath11p@xmath36 at 1900based on the flux in band between 1863 and 1963  tabulated in kinney et al ( 1993 ) .",
    "our value has been corrected for foreground galactic extinction , but not for any internal extinction in the starburst . for an _ unreddened _ starburst , the quoted quantity represents about half the bolometric luminosity ( cf .",
    "meurer et al 1995 ) . the log of the ratio of the far - ir and uv luminosities uses the value for the far - ir luminosity from table 1 .",
    "we also list the sum of the observed far - ir and uv luminosities .",
    "this approximates the _ intrinsic _ uv luminosity ( i.e. the sum of absorbed and escaping uv light - cf .",
    "wang & heckman 1996 ; meurer et al 1998 ) .",
    "both the ratio and sum of the far - ir and uv luminosities might be affected by the small size of the iue aperture relative to that of iras ( we may be missing a significant fraction of the uv light ) .",
    "this issue has been examined empirically by meurer et al ( 1998 ) .",
    "they have evaluated the residuals in the correlation between uv spectral slope @xmath29 and the far - ir / uv flux ratio for these starbursts as a function of the angular size of the starburst host galaxy in the visible . for galaxies with optical diameters larger than about 5 arcmin",
    "they find a clear systematic excess in the ratio of far - ir / uv flux at a given value of @xmath29 ( by a typical factor of about two ) . for galaxies with smaller angular sizes",
    ", there is no significant trend with angular size .",
    "they argue that this lack of a trend , together with the tightness of the correlation between uv color and far - ir / uv flux ratio , implies that the iue aperture does not miss a significant fraction of the uv flux for galaxies with optical angular sizes smaller than about 5 arcmin .",
    "this illustrates that the uv emission in these starburst galaxies must be significantly more compact than the visible band emission from the galaxy . in our sample , only eight galaxies ( ngc 4214 , ngc 4449 , ngc 1097 , ngc 2903 , ngc 3351 , ngc 4258 , ngc 4321 , and ngc 5236 ) have optical diameters greater than 5 arcmin .",
    "we have verified that none of the conclusions listed below are changed if these galaxies are omitted from the sample .",
    "before discussing the results of our analysis of the starbursts vacuum - uv spectra , it is useful to briefly summarize how such spectra can be used to diagnose the interstellar and stellar components of starbursts .",
    "the effect of dust on the uv properties of starbursts is profound .",
    "previous papers have established that various independent indicators of dust extinction in starbursts correlate strongly with one another .",
    "calzetti et al ( 1994;1996 ) show that the spectral slope in the vacuum - uv continuum ( as parameterized by @xmath29 , where f@xmath37 ) correlates strongly with the nebular extinction measured in the optical using the balmer decrement .",
    "meurer et al ( 1997 ) show that @xmath29 correlates well with the ratio of far - ir to vacuum - uv flux : the greater the fraction of the uv that is absorbed by dust and re - radiated in the far - ir , the redder the vacuum - uv continuum .",
    "the interpretation of these correlations with @xmath29 in terms of the effects of dust are particularly plausible because the _ intrinsic _ value for @xmath29 in a starburst is a relatively robust quantity .",
    "figures 31 and 32 in leitherer & heckman ( 1995 ) show that @xmath29 should have a value between about -2.0 and -2.6 for the range of ages , initial mass functions , and ages appropriate for starbursts .",
    "our detailed understanding of the above results is incomplete , since they must involve both the geometrical distribution of the dust , gas , and stars in the starburst and the vacuum - uv extinction law for the dust .",
    "however , the available data strongly suggest that ( quite surprisingly ) much of the dust responsible for the extinction is apparently distributed in the form of a moderately inhomogeneous foreground screen or ` sheath ' surrounding the starburst ( gordon , calzetti , & witt 1997 and references therein ) . in the context of the present paper",
    ", this result has the happy implication that ( with the exception of the most heavily dust - shrouded starbursts like m 82 and arp 220 , which are not in our sample ) we are able to directly study much of the stellar population responsible for ` powering ' the starburst via observations in the vacuum - uv ( albeit often through several magnitudes of attenuation ) .",
    "we will therefore adopt the quantities @xmath29 and l@xmath38/l@xmath39 ( table 2 ) as indicators of dust reddening and extinction respectively in the rest of this paper .",
    "the vacuum - uv spectra of starburst are characterized by strong absorption features .",
    "these absorption features can have three different origins : stellar winds , stellar photospheres , and interstellar gas .",
    "detailed analyses of hst and hut spectra of starbursts show that the resonance lines due to species with low - ionization potentials ( oi , cii , siii , feii , alii , etc . ) are primarily interstellar in origin .",
    "in contrast , the resonance lines due to high - ionization species ( nv , siiv , civ ) can contain significant contributions from both stellar winds and interstellar gas , with the relative importance of each varying from starburst to starburst ( conti et al 1996 ; leitherer et al 1996 ; heckman & leitherer 1997 ; gonzalez - delgado et al 1998a , b ; robert et al 1998 ) . the stellar wind contribution to these lines can also be seen in the iue data themselves .",
    "robert , leitherer , & heckman ( 1993 ) have studied a composite iue spectrum of 13 starbursts drawn from the present sample , and conclude that a significant stellar wind contribution to the civ and siiv lines is indicated by the large blueshifts of these lines . as a counter - example , ngc 1705 is a case in which the interstellar medium actually dominates the civ and siiv absorption ( york et al 1990 ; heckman & leitherer 1997 ; sahu & blades 1997 ) .",
    "the most unambiguous detection of stellar photospheric lines is provided by excited transitions , which are usually rather weak ( cf .",
    "heckman & leitherer 1997 ) .    as a guide to the discussion to follow , in figure 1 we present two high signal - to - noise vacuum - uv spectra formed by averaging together the iue spectra of our large sample of starburst galaxies .",
    "each individual normalized de - redshifted spectrum was weighted by square of the average signal - to - noise ratio in the continuum ( to optimize the signal - to - noise in the final composite spectrum ) . the first template ( ` low - metallicity starburst ' )",
    "was formed from those objects in table 1 with metallicity less than 0.4 solar ( mean of 0.16 solar ) .",
    "the second ( ` high - metallicity starburst ' ) was formed from those objects in table 1 with metallicity greater than 0.5 solar ( mean of 1.1 times solar ) .",
    "figure 1 indicates the identification of the strongest absorption and emission features , along with the likely origin of the feature ( e.g. stellar - wind , photospheric , interstellar ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the vacuum - uv spectra of starbursts are dominated by strong _ absorption_-lines , but the nebular _",
    "emission_-lines are very weak ( the reverse of the situation in the visible - cf .",
    "leitherer , 1997 ) .        apart from the effects of dust , we find that the starburst s metallicity ( @xmath18 ) is the single most important parameter in determining its vacuum - uv properties ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "in fact , metallicity and the effects of dust are well - correlated .    in figure 2a , b we show the strong correlations between @xmath18 and the dust - indicators @xmath29 and l@xmath38/l@xmath39 ( see table 3 ) . at low metallicity ( @xmath4010% solar ) a significant fraction of the intrinsic vacuum - uv actually escapes the starburst ( l@xmath38/l@xmath39 @xmath6 unity ) , and the vacuum - uv colors are consistent with the intrinsic ( unreddened ) colors expected for a starburst population ( @xmath41 -2.5 ) . in contrast , at high metallicities ( @xmath4 solar ) 90% to 99% of the energy is emerging in the far - ir ( l@xmath38/l@xmath39 = 10 to 100 ) and the vacuum - uv colors are very red ( @xmath42 0 ) .",
    "storchi - bergmann , calzetti , & kinney ( 1994 - hereafter sbck ) had previously noted the correlation between @xmath18 and uv color .",
    "we believe these correlations have a straightforward interpretation : the vacuum - uv radiation escaping from starbursts suffers an increasing amount of reddening and extinction as the dust - to - gas ratio in the starburst ism increases with metallicity",
    ". this will be true provided that neither the gas column density towards the starburst , nor the fraction of interstellar metals locked into dust grains are strong functions of @xmath18 .",
    "the properties of the vacuum - uv stellar absorption - lines are also strongly dependent on metallicity . in figure 3",
    "we show the correlation of the strengths of the high - ionization ( civ and siiv ) lines with @xmath18 .",
    "note that the civ line has a weak stellar emission component , and that we have measured the net absorption strength .",
    "this @xmath18-dependence ( noted previously by sbck ) is not surprising , given the likely strong contribution to these lines by from stellar winds .",
    "theoretically , we expect that since hot - star winds are radiatively driven ( castor , abbott , & klein 1975 ) , the strengths of the vacuum - uv stellar wind lines will be metallicity - dependent .",
    "this is confirmed by available hst and hut spectra of lmc and especially smc stars ( walborn et al 1995 ; puls et al 1996 ) .",
    "if post - main - sequence stars ( supergiants and wolf - rayet stars ) contribute significantly to the integrated light , the stellar wind properties enter in a second , indirect way .",
    "that is , the spectral synthesis models heavily depend on the evolutionary history of the ob population , which in turn is critically dependent on the stellar mass - loss rates , which in turn are a function of the metal abundance ( see maeder & conti 1994 ) .",
    "the high signal - to - noise ratios in the composite spectra shown in figure 1 allow us to look for the generally - weak absorption - lines that are of stellar - photospheric origin ( because they correspond to transitions out of highly excited states ) . in the high - metallicity composite spectrum",
    "we identify the following lines of predominantly stellar photospheric origin : ciii@xmath111175 , the blend of siiii@xmath111417 and ciii@xmath431426,1428 , sv@xmath111502 , siiii@xmath111892 , and feiii@xmath431925,1960 .",
    "these features are significantly weaker ( see figure 1 ) in the low - metallicity composite spectrum , and we can only tentatively detect a few lines ( possibly ciii@xmath111892 , feiii@xmath111925 , and feiii@xmath111960 ) . in hst spectra of starbursts , the blend of siiii photospheric lines centered near 1299   is relatively strong .",
    "with the low spectral resolution of iue this feature is inextricably blended with the strong siii+oi interstellar lines at @xmath6 1303  .",
    "finally , we find that the properties of both the interstellar absorption - lines and nebular emission - lines also depend strongly on starburst metallicity .",
    "as shown in figure 4 , the strengths of the low - ionization absorption - lines ( which hst and hut spectra show to be primarily interstellar in origin ) correlate well with metallicity , but with a very shallow slope .",
    "this is not too surprising .",
    "analyses of hst and hut spectra ( cf .",
    "heckman & leitherer 1997 ; sahu & blades 1997 ; gonzalez - delgado et al 1998a , b ; pettini & lipman 1995 ) show that the strong interstellar lines are saturated ( highly optically - thick ) . in this case , the line equivalent width is only weakly dependent on the ionic column density , and more strongly on the velocity dispersion of the absorbing gas : @xmath44^{0.5}$ ] , where @xmath45 is the normal doppler line - broadening parameter . over the range that we sample well",
    ", the starburst metallicity increases by a factor of almost 40 ( from 0.08 to 3 solar ) .",
    "accounting for the mean contribution to the measured lines by galactic foreground gas ( roughly 0.8 as discussed above ) , the equivalent widths of the strong interstellar lines only increase by an average factor of 2 to 3 over this metallicity range .",
    "this is consistent with the strong interstellar lines being very optically - thick , at least in the high - metallicity starbursts .",
    "our inspection of hst spectra of starbursts implies that the correlation in fig .",
    "4 also reflects a trend for larger velocity dispersions in the absorbing gas in the starbursts with higher metallicity .",
    "the vacuum - uv nebular emission - lines in starbursts are weak ( and the potentially - strong ly@xmath46 emission - line is corrupted by the strong geocoronal feature ) .",
    "nevertheless , figure 1 shows that there is a trend for stronger nebular emission - lines ( on - average ) in the starbursts of _ lower _ metallicity .",
    "this effect is seen in both the ciii]@xmath111909 and cii]@xmath112326 ( not shown in fig .",
    "1 ) emission - lines , so it can not be due to a dependence of ionization - state on @xmath18 .",
    "moreover , the fact that these are both semi - forbidden - lines implies that the weaker line - emission at high - metallicity is not due to preferential dust - extinction of the emission - line photons via multiple scattering of resonance - lines ( as may occur in the case of ly@xmath46 - cf .",
    "chen & neufeld 1994 ; giavalisco et al 1996 ) .",
    "instead , the correlation may be due either to a decreasing ratio of ionizing radiation with respect to non - ionizing vacuum - uv radiation at high - metallicity , or ( more likely ) to a decrease in the equilibrium electron temperature in higher - metallicity gas that shifts nebular cooling via collisionally - excited line - emission from the uv to the ir .      in this section",
    ", we document the empirical relationships between the dust - sensitive properties of the vacuum - uv continuum and the other major vacuum - uv ` observables ' , namely the strengths of the prominent absorption features .    in figure 5a , b we show how the strengths of the low - ionization ( cii , oi , and siii ) and high - ionization ( civ and siiv ) resonance absorption - lines depend upon the vacuum - uv spectral slope @xmath29 .",
    "figure 6a , b similarly plots the strengths of the low - ionization and high - ionization absorption - lines versus the ratio of the ir and uv luminosities . in all four plots we see strong correlations ( see table 3 ) , in the sense that the absorption - lines are stronger in starbursts whose vacuum - uv continuum suffers more severe reddening and extinction due to dust .",
    "these correlations are somewhat stronger for the low - ionization lines ( r = 0.84 and 0.75 for fig . 5a and 6a ) than for the high - ionization lines ( r = 0.76 and 0.66 for fig . 5b and 6b ) .",
    "the stronger _ interstellar _ absorption - lines in systems having a higher amount of dust extinction and reddening is physically reasonable , since both trace the effect of interstellar metals on the escaping uv light .",
    "however , as noted above , these interstellar lines are optically - thick , and so their strength is only weakly dependent on ionic column density .",
    "this contrasts with @xmath29 , since in a simple foreground - screen interpretation of the reddening , the difference between the observed and intrinsic value of @xmath29 ( @xmath47@xmath29 = @xmath48 - @xmath49 ) is just linearly proportional to the foreground dust column density . since we would expect the column densities of the gas - phase metal - ions and the dust to be roughly proportional to one another , it is then difficult to understand the strong and roughly linear dependence of the equivalent widths of the strongly saturated interstellar lines on @xmath29 .",
    "we infer then that the strong correlation in figure 5a implies that there must also be a trend for the velocity dispersion in the starburst ism to be larger in the cases where the effective reddening suffered by the vacuum - uv continuum is larger .",
    "this trend is present in the small sample of starbursts with hst uv spectra having adequate spectral resolution to measure the line widths .",
    "finally , in figure 7 we show that there is a strong positive correlation ( r = 0.69 ) between the strengths of the low - ionization ( mostly interstellar ) lines and the high - ionization ( stellar - plus- interstellar ) lines .",
    "this correlation probably reflects both the interstellar contribution to the high - ionization lines and the mutual dependence of the strengths of both the high- and low- ionization lines on the metallicity ( figures 3 and 4 ) .",
    "in this section we will approximate the _ intrinsic _ starburst uv luminosity as the sum of the _ observed _ vacuum- uv and far - ir luminosities ( roughly representing the escaping and reprocessed uv light respectively ) .",
    "except in the starbursts of the lowest metallicity , the starburst luminosity is dominated by the far - ir emission ( see section 3.2 above ) .",
    "we preface this discussion by noting that there is a potentially significant selection effect that can affect our conclusions .",
    "even though our sample of starbursts is not rigorously defined , a starburst is loosely defined to be an event that contributes significantly to ( or even dominates ) the bolometric luminosity of its ` host ' galaxy .",
    "this means that our sample will be selectively missing low - luminosity regions of star - formation in luminous galaxies .",
    "given the strong correlation between metallicity and galaxy absolute magnitude ( zaritzky , kennicutt , & huchra 1994 ) , this also means that we will be selectively missing low - luminosity metal - rich ` starbursts ' ( e.g. giant hii regions in luminous , metal - rich galaxies ) .",
    "this effect can clearly be seen in figure 8 , which shows a highly significant positive correlation ( r = 0.59 ) between the luminosity of the starburst and its metallicity . however",
    ", this correlation can not be entirely due to selection effects .",
    "the above effect explains why the lower right part of the figure ( high metallicity , low luminosity ) is un - populated .",
    "however , it does _ not _ explain the scarcity of points in the upper left ( low metallicity , high luminosity ) .",
    "it appears that the maximum starburst luminosity scales with metallicity .",
    "this is likely to be a secondary correlation , due to the mutual dependence of both starburst luminosity and metallicity on the absolute magnitude and mass of the starburst host galaxy ( see section 3.5 below ) .",
    "we also find ( figure 9a , b ) that the most luminous starbursts suffer the most severe extinction and reddening due to dust . only starbursts with @xmath50 few @xmath51 l@xmath9 have colors expected for an unreddened starburst and have vacuum - uv luminosities that rival their far - ir luminosities . starbursts that lie at or above the ` knee ' in the local starburst luminosity function ( @xmath52 few @xmath53 l@xmath9 - cf .",
    "soifer et al 1987 ) have red uv continua ( @xmath42 -1 to + 0.4 ) and are dominated by far - ir emission ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "the caveat discussed above is relevant : while the paucity of luminous unreddened / unextinguished starbursts is real , the lack of heavily reddened / extinguished low - luminosity ` starbursts ' in our sample is a selection effect .",
    "it is also worth emphasizing that the trend seen in figure 9b is not unique to starbursts .",
    "wang & heckman ( 1996 ) have previously shown that normal star - forming disk galaxies ( non - starburst systems ) also exhibit a strong positive correlation between uv dust opacity ( the global ratio of far - ir and uv flux ) and intrinsic global uv luminosity ( the sum of the observed uv and far - ir luminosities ) .",
    "this is not the result of the kind of selection effect discussed above .",
    "finally , in figure 10a , b we show the correlations between starburst luminosity @xmath55 and the strengths of the high - ionization and low - ionization absorption - lines .",
    "these correlations are significant , but weaker ( r = 0.54 ; r = 0.46 ) than the correlations of @xmath18 with both @xmath55 ( r = 0.59 ) and with line strengths ( r = 0.85 and r = 0.66 for the high- and low - ionization lines respectively ) .",
    "thus , the correlations shown in figure 10 may be secondary ones .",
    "the selection effect described above will certainly be pertinent to figure 10a ( that is , the lack of ` starbursts ' with strong stellar wind lines and low luminosity is a selection effect ) .",
    "the situation regarding the interstellar lines ( figure 10b ) is less clear in this regard , since the line strengths are probably set largely by the velocity dispersion in the gas rather than by its metallicity .",
    "it is interesting that none of the above parameters ( @xmath29 , @xmath56 , @xmath18 , or line strength ) correlate with the luminosity of the _ escaping _ uv radiation ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "for example , the correlation between the _ intrinsic _ starburst luminosity and line strength ( figure 10 ) is ` undone ' by the inverse correlation between intrinsic starburst luminosity and the fraction that escapes in the uv ( figure 9b ) .",
    "having explored the correlations among the various starburst properties , we now briefly consider the relationship between the starburst and its ` host galaxy ' .",
    "we characterize the host galaxy in two ways : its rotation speed ( @xmath58 ) and its absolute blue magnitude ( @xmath26 ) - see table 1 .",
    "it is important to note that while the quantity @xmath59 should be a characteristic of the host galaxy that is unaffected by the starburst , the starburst may in principle make a significant contribution to @xmath26 . to assess this quantitatively ,",
    "we have used the sum @xmath55 to approximate the intinsic uv luminosity of the starburst , and used the models of leitherer & heckman ( 1995 ) to then predict the starburst absolute blue magnitude ( _ in the absence of dust extinction _ ) .",
    "we then find that the median value for the contribution of the unextinguished starburst to the total observed blue light from the galaxy is only about 20% .",
    "extinction will significantly diminish this contribution .",
    "the typical values for @xmath56 ( e.g. fig .",
    "2b ) together with the starburst effective dust ` obscuration law ' determined by calzetti ( 1997 ) imply that the typical extinction in the b - band will be about a magnitude .",
    "thus , we conclude that ( with the possible exceptions of the few most powerful starbursts in our sample ) , the quantity @xmath26 primarily measures the properties of the starburst s host galaxy .",
    "figures 11 and 12 show montages of the correlations of @xmath27 and @xmath26 respectively with the principal properties of the starburst . from this",
    "it is clear that brighter and more massive galaxies host more - metal - rich , dustier , and more - luminous ( but note the caveat in section 3.4 above ) starbursts with stronger uv absorption - lines . in a similar vein ,",
    "wang & heckman ( 1996 ) have shown that normal star - forming disk galaxies also exhibit a strong dependence of the uv opacity ( as measured by the ratio of far - ir and uv flux ) on both @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "apart from the very strong correlation of @xmath26 with @xmath55 ( which at least in part is due to the selection effect described in section 3.4 ) , the strongest correlations of both @xmath27 and @xmath26 are with starburst metallicity ( table 3 ) .",
    "it has been previously shown that the mean metallicity of the gas and stars in normal galaxies correlates strongly and positively with the galaxy rotation speed , stellar velocity dispersion , and absolute magnitude ( cf .",
    "bender et al 1993 ; zaritsky et al 1994 ; skillman et al 1989 ) .",
    "thus , the strong analogous correlations exhibited by the starbursts are perhaps not surprising .",
    "since we have previously shown ( section 3.2 ) that higher - metallicity starbursts are dustier and have stronger uv absorption - lines , the corresponding correlations with the host galaxy properties are probably secondary in nature .",
    "even though there is a weak correlation between the host galaxy rotation speed and starburst luminosity , even relatively low - mass galaxies can host moderately powerful starbursts like m 82 ( see lehnert & heckman 1996a ) .",
    "the relative weakness of the correlation between the strength of the interstellar absorption - lines and @xmath27 ( figure 11 ) , is especially interesting .",
    "as emphasized above , the optically - thick nature of the strong interstellar lines means that their strengths are ( to - first - order ) determined primarily by the velocity dispersion in the ism of the starburst .",
    "the weakness of the correlation of line strength with @xmath27 then suggests that the dynamics of the absorbing gas are not _ dominated _ by the gravitational potential of the host galaxy .",
    "this inference is further supported by the enormous equivalent widths of the starburst interstellar lines , since these require correspondingly large velocity dispersions .",
    "for example , for gas with a maxwellian velocity distribution and a line - center optical depth of 10 ( 100 ) in a strong uv resonance line , the observed equivalent widths of 4 to 6   in the strong - lined starbursts imply three - dimensional velocity dispersions in the gas of @xmath60 km s@xmath7 ( where @xmath61 is the fraction of the uv continuum that is covered by absorbing material ) .",
    "these velocity dispersions are significantly greater than the observed rotation speeds ( typically 100 to 200 km s@xmath7 ) .",
    "of course , the most direct evidence for a non - gravitational origin of the gas - dynamics comes from analyses of hst and hut spectra of individual starbursts .",
    "these show that the interstellar absorption - lines are often blueshifted by one - to - several - hundred km s@xmath7 with respect to the systemic velocity of the galaxy ( heckman & leitherer 1997 ; gonzalez - delgado et al 1998a , b ; lequeux et al 1995 ; kunth et al 1998 ) .",
    "thus , in many cases , the absorbing gas is flowing outward from the starburst , probably helping to ` feed ' the superwinds that have been studied heretofore mostly via their optical ( e.g. lehnert & heckman 1996b ) and x - ray ( e.g. dahlem , weaver , & heckman 1998 ) emission .",
    "thus , the kinematic properties of the strong interstellar absorption - lines in starbursts reflect in part the hydrodynamical consequences of the starburst , and do not straightforwardly probe the gravitational potential of the host galaxy .",
    "the principal conclusion of this paper is that local starbursts occupy a very small fractional volume in the multi - dimensional manifold defined by such fundamental parameters as the extinction , metallicity , and vacuum - uv line strengths ( both stellar and interstellar ) of the starburst and the rotation speed ( mass ) and absolute magnitude of the starburst s ` host ' galaxy .",
    "more metal - rich starbursts are redder , more heavily extinguished ( ir - dominated ) , have stronger vacuum - uv lines , occur in more massive and brighter host galaxies , and can be more luminous .",
    "starbursts with solar or higher metallicity are heavily extinguished indeed : only 1 to 10% of the vacuum - uv radiation escapes and the resulting uv spectral energy distribution is nearly flat in f@xmath36 ( fig .",
    "2 ) . only the most metal - poor starbursts ( @xmath40 10% solar ) are relatively unaffected by dust ( fig .",
    "these correlations are not surprising , since we expect the dust - to - gas ratio in the starburst s ism to scale roughly with metallicity .    in principle , relatively red vacuum - uv spectral energy distributions could be due to the effects of the age of the stellar population or the form of the initial mass function ( imf ) rather than dust .",
    "that is , the redder spectra might correspond to older starbursts , starbursts whose uv spectrum was more heavily contaminated by an older underlying stellar population , or starbursts with a steeper ( less o - star - enriched ) imf .",
    "however , the strong correlation between the uv color ( @xmath29 ) and the strengths of the civ and siiv ( predominantly ) stellar wind lines ( fig .",
    "5b ) shows that this can not be the case : an age or imf effect would require the stellar wind features due to o stars to be _ weaker _ in the redder starbursts - exactly the opposite of what we observe .",
    "the metal - poor starbursts have systematically weaker vacuum - uv absorption - lines ( fig .",
    "1 ) . in the case of the stellar wind lines ( fig .",
    "3 ) , this result agrees with expectations based on both theory and observations of metal - poor , hot , high - mass stars . in the case of the interstellar lines ( figure 4 ) ,",
    "this probably reflects both higher average ionic column densities and larger velocity dispersions in the more metal - rich starbursts .",
    "that is , even though the strong interstellar lines are optically - thick ( and their strength will thus be set to first - order by the velocity dispersion ) , there will still be a weak dependence of equivalent width on column density .",
    "moreover , the more metal - rich starbursts can also be more powerful ( fig .",
    "8) and are situated in more massive galaxies ( fig .",
    "we expect them to have higher average ism velocity dispersions , since both gravity and the mechanical ` stirring ' provided by supernovae and stellar winds will contribute to the gas dynamics .",
    "the trend for the more metal - rich starbursts to occur in brighter and more massive host galaxies ( fig .",
    "11 and 12 ) presumably reflects the well - known mass - metallicity relation defined by normal galaxies ( e.g. zaritsky , kennicutt , & huchra 1994 ) .",
    "that is , the ism in massive galaxies will already be pre - enriched to relatively high metallicity before the starburst is even initiated . during the starburst itself , the fraction of the newly - synthesized metals that are retained ( rather than blown out ) should also be a strong function of the depth of the gravitational potential well ( e.g. dekel & silk 1986 ) .",
    "the correlation between the metallicity and the luminosity of the starburst ( even though it is due in part to selection effects - see section 3.4 ) may reflect other fundamental trends : more massive galaxies can host more powerful starbursts ( fig .",
    "11 ) and have more metal - rich interstellar gas with which to fuel the starburst .",
    "_ vs. _ rotation - speed connection in starbursts has been previously discussed by heckman ( 1993 ) , lehnert & heckman ( 1996b ) , and meurer et al ( 1997 ) : basic considerations of causality in a self - gravitating system demand that the maximum star - formation rate will scale as the cube of the rotation speed .",
    "the above results are not only very illuminating regarding the nature of the starburst phenomenon , they also have a variety of interesting implications for the interpretation of the rest - frame - uv properties of galaxies at high - redshift .",
    "first and foremost , starbursts in the present universe emit most of their light in the far - infrared , not in the ultraviolet ( fig .",
    "thus , an ultraviolet census of the local universe would significantly underestimate the true high - mass star - formation - rate and would systematically under - represent the most powerful , most metal- rich starbursts ( fig .",
    "2 ) , occuring in the most massive galaxies ( fig . 11 ) .",
    "this _ may _ also be true at high - redshift , where the current estimates of star - formation rely almost exclusively on data pertaining to the rest - frame vacuum - uv ( e.g. madau et al 1996 , 1998 ) .",
    "if there _ is _ a dependence of dust extinction on luminosity at high - redshift , this will affect the apparent shape of the luminosity function .",
    "for example , current samples at high - redshift might under - represent young / forming massive elliptical galaxies .",
    "these would have high metallicities ( and thus a high dust - to - gas ratio ) coupled with very large average gas surface mass densities ( @xmath62 @xmath17 ) , and would hence have large dust opacities .    using the strong correlation between the vacuum - uv color of local starbursts ( @xmath29 ) and the ratio of far - ir to vacuum - uv light emitted by local starbursts , meurer et al ( 1998 ) estimate that an average vacuum - uv - selected galaxy at high - redshift ( e.g. steidel et al 1996 ; lowenthal et al 1997 ) suffers about 2 to 3 magnitudes of uv extinction ( in agreement with modeling of the rest - frame uv - through - visible spectral energy distributions by sawicki & yee 1998 ) .",
    "the ` correct ' prescription for de - extincting the high- redshift galaxies in order to correctly obtain the bolometric luminosity and star - formation rate is a matter of on - going debate ( see pettini 1997 and madau et al 1996 , 1998 for other viewpoints ) .",
    "for example , one uncertainty at high - redshift is the unknown relative importance of the age or the imf of the stellar population _ vs. _ dust in producing the observed uv spectral energy distribution . as we have argued above , the trend for the _ redder _ starbursts to have _ stronger _ absorption features due to massive stars ( fig .",
    "5b ) rules out age or the imf as the primary determinant of uv color in our sample .",
    "thus , it will be extremely interesting to see if the same correlation holds in the high - redshift galaxies . in any case",
    ", it seems fair to conclude that the history of high - mass star - formation in the universe at early times will remain uncertain until the effects of dust extinction are better understood .",
    "the extinction corrections advocated by meurer et al ( 1997 ) imply large bolometric luminosities for the high - redshift galaxies ( @xmath6 10@xmath63 to 10@xmath64 l@xmath9 for h@xmath65 = 75 km s@xmath7 mpc@xmath7 and q@xmath65 = 0.1 ) .",
    "interestingly , the bolometric surface - brightnesses of the extinction - corrected high - redshift galaxies are then very similar to the values seen in local starbursts : @xmath6 10@xmath66 to 10@xmath63 l@xmath9 kpc@xmath67 ( meurer et al 1997 ) .",
    "the high - redshift galaxies thus appear to be ` scaled - up ' ( larger and more luminous ) versions of the local starbursts . the physics behind this ` characteristic ' surface - brightness is unclear ( cf .",
    "meurer et al 1997 ; lehnert & heckman 1996a ) .",
    "however , it is intruiging that the implied average surface - mass - density of the stars within the half- light radius ( @xmath6 10@xmath68 to 10@xmath69 m@xmath9 pc@xmath67 ) is quite similar to the values in present - day elliptical galaxies .",
    "are we witnessing the formation of elliptical galaxies and/or bulges , or only the formation of precursor fragments thereof ( e.g. sawicki & yee 1998 ; trager et al 1997 ) ?    if the high - redshift galaxies are indeed scaled - up versions of local starbursts , we might expect that they would follow the same trends summarized above .",
    "for example , do the high- redshift galaxies should show the same strong correlation between the strength of the uv absorption - lines ( stellar and interstellar ) and @xmath29 ( fig .",
    "5 ) , whereby the more metal - rich local starbursts are both redder and stronger - lined ? as more near - ir ( rest - frame visible ) data become available , will the high - redshift galaxies obey the starburst correlations ( fig . 11 and 12 ) of both vacuum - uv color and absorption - lines strengths with m@xmath70 and rotation speed ( do they follow a mass - metallicity relation ? ) . when the high - redshift galaxies are extinction - corrected , are the more luminous systems redder and stronger - lined in the uv ( as in the case of the local starbursts - fig . 9 and 10",
    "respectively ) ? finally ,",
    "do the strengths of the low - ionization ( primarily interstellar ) and high - ionization ( significant stellar wind contribution ) absorption - lines correlate well with one - another , as in the local starbursts ( fig .",
    "7 ) ?    if the answers to these questions are ` yes ' ( that is , if the high - redshift galaxies and local starbursts do occupy the same parts of the multi - dimensional parameter space summarized above ) , we might be able to use the uv properties of the high- redshift galaxies to ` guesstimate ' their metallicities .",
    "for example , the strong correlation between vacuum - uv color ( @xmath29 ) and metallicity in local starbursts ( fig .",
    "2 ) - if applied naively to high- redshift galaxies - would suggest a broad range in metallicity from substantially subsolar to solar or higher and a median value of perhaps 0.3 solar . this is somewhat higher than the mean metallicity in the damped ly@xmath46 systems ( pettini et al 1997 ; vladilo 1997 ; lu et al 1997 ) , but this may be due to selection effects : the uv - selected galaxies are the most actively star - forming regions of galaxies , while the damped ly@xmath46 systems tend to sample the outer , less - chemically - enriched parts of galaxies ( e.g. prochaska & wolfe 1997 ) or perhaps proto - galactic fragments or dwarf galaxies ( e.g. vladilo 1997 ) .",
    "our ` guesstimated ' metallicities of the high - redshift galaxies are much higher than those suggested by trager et al ( 1997 ) , who argue that we are witnessing the formation of population ii spheroidal systems .",
    "it is also important to sound a cautionary note : most of the strong absorption - lines in the spectra of local starbursts are of _ interstellar _ rather than _ stellar _ origin .",
    "this is probably generically true for the low - ionization resonance lines ( although b stars may make a non - negligible contribution ) .",
    "even the high - ionization resonance lines like civ and siiv can contain strong interstellar contributions .",
    "in fact , in extreme cases ( e.g. ngc 1705 ) even these lines are dominated by interstellar gas .",
    "this highlights the difficulty in using the uv spectra of galaxies to deduce their stellar content : data of relatively high spectral resolution and signal - to - noise are needed to reliably isolate the stellar and interstellar components . simply measuring the equivalent widths of the lines",
    "is not enough : it is the _ profile shapes _ that contain the key information .",
    "the stellar photospheric absorption - lines identified in fig .",
    "1 may be the most straightforward features for the detection of stars in high - redshift galaxies , since they are not resonance lines , and so are uncontaminated by interstellar absorption .",
    "unfortunately , most of these lines are weak . the relatively strong ciii@xmath111175 line is lost in the ly@xmath46 forest at high - redshift , and the ciii@xmath111892 , feiii@xmath111925 , and feiii@xmath111960 lines are often ` clobbered ' by the oh night - sky lines in galaxies at z @xmath4 2.6 .",
    "finally - based on local starbursts - it seems likely that the gas kinematics that are measured in the high - redshift galaxies using the interstellar absorption - lines are telling us a great deal about the hydrodynamical consequences of high - mass star - formation on the interstellar medium , and thus it will be difficult to use them to straightforwardly glean information about the gravitational potential or mass of the galaxy . even the widths of the optical nebular emission - lines in local starbursts are not always reliable tracers of the galaxy potential well ( cf .",
    "lehnert & heckman 1996a ; but see melnick , terlevich , & moles 1988 ) .",
    "this means that it may be tricky to determine masses for the high - redshift galaxies without measuring real rotation - curves via spatially - resolved spectroscopy .    on the brighter side",
    ", there is now rather direct observational evidence that the kinematics of the interstellar absorption - lines in the high - redshift galaxies reflect an outflowing metal - enriched gas , thereby allowing us to directly study the ` pollution ' of the inter - galactic medium with metals in the early universe .",
    "the signature of these outflows is interstellar absorption lines that are systematically blueshifted by several hundred km s@xmath7 relative to the ly@xmath46 emission - line ( franx et al 1997 ; heckman 1997 ; pettini 1997 ) . in local starbursts ,",
    "this is due to outflowing gas that both produces the blue - shifted absorption - lines and absorbs - away the blue side of the ly@xmath46 emission - line ( lequeux et al 1995 ; gonzalez - delgado et al 1998a , b ; kunth et al 1998 ) .",
    "the case for an outflow in the high - redshift galaxies could be strengthened by using the weak stellar photospheric lines ( fig .",
    "1 ) to unambiguously determine the galaxy systemic velocity - cf .",
    "heckman & leitherer ( 1997 ) and sahu & blades ( 1997 ) .",
    "if these outflows escape the galactic potential well , we should see their cumulative effect in the form of a metal - enriched inter - galactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "the most dramatic such evidence is the existence of an igm in rich clusters of galaxies whose metal content probably exceeds that of the cluster galaxies themselves .",
    "recent asca x - ray spectra of hot gas in clusters of galaxies show approximately solar abundance ratios for the @xmath46-process elements like o , ne , and si relative to fe ( mushotzky et al 1996 ; ishimaru & arimoto 1997 ) .",
    "this implicates ` core - collapse ' supernovae ( the end product of high - mass stars ) and - by inference - starburst - driven superwinds as the source of at least 90% of the metals in the cluster igm ( renzini 1997 ; gibson , loewenstein , & mushotzky 1997 ) . more generally , the presence of metals in the ` ly@xmath46 forest ' at high - redshift ( the cloudy component of the early igm ) is certainly suggestive of the dispersal of chemically- enriched material by early superwinds ( cf .",
    "cowie et al 1995 ; madau & shull 1996 ) .",
    "the ly@xmath46 forest clouds appear to have a high ratio of si / c , suggestive of core - collapse supernovae as the source ( cowie et al 1995 ; giroux & shull 1997 ) .    in conclusion ,",
    "vacuum - ultraviolet observations give us a rich array of diagnostic probes of the stellar and interstellar components of starbursts in the local universe .",
    "the analysis described in this paper strongly suggests that these starbursts obey well - defined relationships between such key physical parameters as extinction , metallicity , starburst luminosity and gas dynamics , and host galaxy mass .",
    "these objects can therefore serve as local laboratories in which we can study the processes that were important in the galaxy- building events that can now be directly observed at high - redshift .",
    "the results of this synergistic study of the most actively - star- forming local and distant galaxies suggests that the latter have rather high uv extinctions ( average factor 5 to 10 ) , may have moderately high metallicities ( typically 0.1 to 1 times solar ) , are probably building galaxies having surface mass - densities comparable to present - day ellipticals , and are suffering substantial losses of metal - enriched outflowing gas that can explain the observed ` pollution ' of the inter - galactic and intra - cluster medium .",

    "<S> we report the results of a systematic study of the vacuum- ultraviolet ( @xmath0 1150 to 2000  ) spectra of a sample of 45 starburst and related galaxies observed with the iue satellite . </S>",
    "<S> these span broad ranges in metallicity ( from 0.02 to 3 times solar ) , bolometric luminosity ( @xmath1 to @xmath2 ) , and galaxy properties ( e.g. including low - mass dwarf galaxies , normal disk galaxies , and massive galactic mergers ) . </S>",
    "<S> the projected size of the iue spectroscopic aperture is typically one to several kpc and therefore usually encompasses the entire starburst and is similar to the aperture - sizes used for spectroscopy of high - redshift galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> our principal conclusion is that local starbursts occupy a very small fractional volume in the multi- dimensional manifold defined by such fundamental parameters as the extinction , metallicity , and vacuum - uv line strengths ( both stellar and interstellar ) of the starburst and the rotation speed ( mass ) and absolute magnitude of the starburst s ` host ' galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> more metal - rich starbursts are redder and more heavily extinguished in the uv , more luminous , have stronger vacuum- uv lines , and occur in more massive and optically - brighter host galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we advocate using these local starbursts as a ` training set ' to learn how to better interpret the rest - frame uv spectra of star - forming galaxies at high - redshift , and stress that the degree of similarity between local starbursts and high - redshift galaxies in this multi - dimensional parameter space can already be tested empirically . </S>",
    "<S> the results on local starbursts suggest that the high- redshift ` lyman drop - out ' galaxies are typically highly reddened and extinguished by dust ( average factor of 5 to 10 in the uv ) , may have moderately high metallicities ( 0.1 to 1 times solar ? ) , are probably building galaxies with stellar surface - mass - densities similar to present - day ellipticals , and may be suffering substantial losses of metal - enriched gas that can ` pollute ' the inter - galactic medium .    = 0em    \\1 . </S>",
