    "we address the problem of human behaviour recognition by separating low - level recognition from high - level recognition .",

    "the output of the latter type of recognition is a set of ` long - term behaviours ' , that is , pre - defined temporal combinations of short - term behaviours .",
    "we focus on high - level recognition .    to perform high - level recognition",
    "we define a set of long - term behaviours of interest  for example , ` leaving an object ' , ` fighting ' and ` meeting '  as temporal combinations of short - term behaviours  for instance , ` walking ' , ` running ' , ` inactive ' ( standing still ) and ` active ' ( body movement in the same position ) .",
    "we employ a logic programming implementation of the event calculus ( ec ) @xcite , a temporal reasoning formalism , in order to express the definition of a long - term behaviour .",
    "more precisely , we employ ec to express the temporal constraints on a set of short - term behaviours that , if satisfied , lead to the recognition of a long - term behaviour .",
    "we evaluate our approach using an existing dataset of short - term behaviours detected on a series of surveillance videos .",
    "we recognise five long - term behaviours achieving high recall and precision rates .",

    "these systems accept as input a stream of time - stamped ` low - level ' ( or ` primitive ' ) events , which are used to recognise ` high - level ' ( or ` derived ' ) events of interest .",
    "the definition of a high - level event , included in a ssrs , imposes a set of constraints on a set of subevents .",
    "we present a comparison of our behaviour recognition system with state - of - the - art ssrs .",
    "we show that a logic programming approach is better suited to a class of recognition applications , including video surveillance , rather than purely temporal reasoning ssrs .",

    "our system for long - term behaviour recognition ( ltbr ) is a logic programming implementation of an event calculus formalisation , expressing long - term behaviour definitions .",
    "the event calculus ( ec ) , introduced by kowalski and sergot @xcite , is a formalism for representing and reasoning about actions or events and their effects .",
    "we present here the version of the ec that we employ ( more details about this version may be found in @xcite ) .",
    "ec is based on a many - sorted first - order predicate calculus .",
    "for the version used here , the underlying time model is linear and it may include real numbers or integers . where @xmath0 is a _ fluent _  a property that is allowed to have different values at different points in time  the term @xmath1 denotes that fluent @xmath0 has value @xmath2 .",

    "predicates , function symbols and constants start with a lower - case letter .",
    "the domain - independent definition of the  predicate is as follows : @xmath12    according to axiom a fluent holds at time @xmath5 if it held initially ( time @xmath7 ) and has not been ` broken ' in the meantime , that is , terminated between times @xmath7 and @xmath5 .",
    "axiom specifies that a fluent holds at a time @xmath5 if it was initiated at some earlier time @xmath13 and has not been terminated between @xmath13 and @xmath5 . `",
    "@xmath14 ' represents ` negation by failure ' @xcite .",
    "the auxiliary predicate @xmath15 is defined as follows : @xmath16    @xmath1 is ` broken ' between @xmath17 and @xmath18 if an event takes place in that interval that terminates @xmath1 .",
    "note that , according to the above axioms , a fluent does not hold at the time that was initiated but holds at the time it was terminated .",
    "a fluent can not have more than one value at any time .",
    "the following axiom captures this feature : @xmath19    axiom states that if an action @xmath20 initiates @xmath21 then @xmath20 also terminates @xmath1 , for all other possible values @xmath2 of the fluent @xmath0 .",
    "we do not insist that a fluent must have a value at every time - point . in this version of ec , therefore , there is a difference between initiating a boolean fluent @xmath22 and terminating @xmath23 : the first implies , but is not implied by , the second .",

    "we used the first dataset of the caviar project to perform long - term behaviour recognition .",
    "this dataset includes 28 surveillance videos of a public space .",
    "the videos are staged  actors walk around , browse information displays , sit down , meet one another , leave objects behind , fight , and so on .",

    "the accuracy of the recognition of the long - term behaviours meeting , moving and fighting was compromised .",
    "it was often impossible to distinguish between these behaviours  for instance , the short - term behaviours of people fighting were often classified as walking or active ( due to the absence of an abrupt motion short - term behaviour ) , leading , in certain conditions , to the recognition of fighting and meeting , or fighting and moving . to overcome this problem , we introduced in the caviar dataset a short - term behaviour for abrupt motion",
    ": we manually edited the annotation of the caviar videos by changing , when necessary , the label of a short - term behaviour to ` abrupt motion ' .",
    "a person is said to exhibit an abrupt motion behaviour if she moves abruptly and her position in the global coordinate system does not change significantly  if it did then her short - term behaviour would be classified as running .",
    "a definition of abrupt motion and a description of a system detecting this type of short - term behaviour may be found in @xcite , for example .",
    "for this set of experiments , therefore , the input to ltbr is : ( i ) the short - term behaviours walking , running , active , inactive and abrupt motion , along with their time - stamps , that is , the frame in which a short - term behaviour took place , ( ii ) the coordinates of the tracked people and objects as pixel positions at each time - point , and ( iii ) the first time and the last time a person or object is tracked ( ` appears'/`disappears ' ) . given this input , ltbr recognises the following long - term behaviours : a person leaving an object , a person being immobile , people meeting , moving together , or fighting .",

    "the @xmath29 fluent records the times in which an object / person ` appears ' and ` disappears ' .",

    "the distance between two tracked objects / people is computed given their coordinates .",
    "based on our empirical analysis the distance between a person leaving an object and the object is at most 30 pixel positions .",
    "an object exhibits only inactive short - term behaviour .",
    "any other type of short - term behaviour would imply that what is tracked is not an object .",

    "an object carried by a person is not tracked  only the person that carries it is tracked .",
    "the object will be tracked , that is , ` appear ' , if and only if the person leaves it somewhere .",

    "this constraint can not be expressed in the crs language for two reasons .",
    "first , the crs language does not allow for the computation of the distance between two people / objects .",
    "this is due to the fact that no mathematical operators are allowed in the constraints of atemporal variables .",

    "moreover , we showed the advantages of our approach with respect to a state - of - the - art recognition system based on a logic programming implementation of an ec dialect .",
    "a logic programming approach to behaviour recognition has the advantage that machine learning techniques can be directly employed in order to adapt a knowledge base of behaviour definitions with the aim of improving behaviour recognition accuracy .",
    "an area of current work is the use of inductive logic programming ( ilp ) techniques for fine - tuning in an automated way behaviour definitions ( see , for example , @xcite for an application of ilp techniques on ec formalisations ) .    another direction of current research concerns the experimental validation of our approach to behaviour recognition in the fields of emergency rescue operations and public transport services . in the context of the eu - project pronto we will define and recognise long - term behaviours that take place in the aforementioned application domains with the aim of supporting intelligent resource management .",
