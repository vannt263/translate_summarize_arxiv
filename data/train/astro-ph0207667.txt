    "the photometric and spectroscopic analyses of @xcite have revealed that the coolest white dwarfs observed in the galactic disk have effective temperatures in excess of @xmath1  k ( see , e.g. , fig",
    ".  21 of * ? ? ?",
    "the absence of any cooler white dwarfs can be interpreted as the result of the finite age of the disk , which has been estimated from a determination of the luminosity function at 8 @xmath2 1.5 gyr @xcite .",
    "this value is also consistent with the location of white dwarfs in a mass versus effective temperature diagram in which theoretical isochrones are overplotted ( see figs .  24 and 25 of * ? ? ?",
    "since the galactic halo is believed to have formed many gyr earlier than the disk , white dwarfs associated with the halo could be considerably older and thus cooler than those found in the disk .",
    "in addition , halo white dwarfs could be easily identified by their peculiar kinematics .",
    "this was first recognized by @xcite who identified 6 white dwarfs in their luminosity function sample that had tangential velocities consistent with a halo population ( @xmath3 km  s@xmath4 ) .",
    "several objects from that small sample are now believed to be too young ( they are too warm and massive ) to belong to the galactic halo , however @xcite .",
    "more recently , white dwarfs with effective temperatures below 4000  k have been identified in various surveys @xcite , many of which are believed to be associated with the halo population . even though the model fluxes are successful at reproducing in detail the optical and infrared broadband photometric observations of white dwarfs above 4000  k @xcite , the observed energy distributions of cooler white dwarfs are at odds with the predictions of model atmosphere calculations .",
    "for instance , the analysis of lhs 3250by @xcite has shown that the observed optical and infrared energy distribution could not be reproduced adequately in terms of a pure hydrogen atmosphere , or a mixed hydrogen and helium composition .",
    "similar conclusions were reached by @xcite . for wd 0346 + 246 ( also analyzed by oppenheimer et al . ) , @xcite was even forced to introduce an _ ad hoc _ source of opacity to reproduce the observed photometry at @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 .",
    "sdss 1337 + 00  is another extremely cool white dwarf discovered by @xcite in imaging data from the sloan digital sky survey .",
    "the optical and near - infrared spectrum of this object resemble that of lhs 3250  ( see fig .  3 of * ? ? ?",
    "photometric observations reported by harris et al .",
    "covered only the optical @xmath8 and a lower limit on the infrared @xmath9 magnitude . in this paper , we report new infrared photometric observations at @xmath9 and @xmath10 for sdss 1337 + 00 , and provide a thorough analysis of this object as well as of lhs 3250 , its almost identical twin . both of these objects exhibit the strong infrared flux deficiency that results from collision - induced absorptions by molecular hydrogen .",
    "new calculations of this important source of opacity by borysow and collaborators has led us to take a fresh look at the atmospheric properties of cool white dwarf atmospheres . in this paper",
    ", we thus explore in detail the effects of effective temperature , surface gravity , and atmospheric composition ( hydrogen , helium , and heavier elements ) on the predicted fluxes , and compare these emergent flux distributions with those of sdss 1337 + 00  and lhs 3250 .",
    "the optical @xmath8 photometric observations for lhs 3250  and sdss 1337 + 00  are taken from @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the infrared @xmath11 photometry for lhs 3250  is also taken from @xcite , while new @xmath9 and @xmath10 photometric observations were secured for sdss 1337 + 00  on the nights of 2001 january 9th and 31st ( ut ) respectively , using the ufti camera on the uk infrared telescope ( ukirt ) on mauna kea hawaii .",
    "total observation time was 72 minutes for @xmath9 and 63 minutes for @xmath10 , made up in both cases of 60 second exposures in a repeated 9-position dither pattern .",
    "ukirt faint standards were used to calibrate the photometry .",
    "the derived magnitudes were @xmath12 and @xmath13 , on the mauna kea photometric system .",
    "the energy distributions of sdss 1337 + 00  and lhs 3250  have been converted into broadband fluxes following the prescription of @xcite .",
    "these are shown in the upper two panels of figure [ fg : f1 ] , together with the spectroscopic observations discussed in @xcite , and kindly made available to us by h. harris .",
    "it is clear from this comparison , at least in the case of sdss 1337 + 00 , that a detailed comparison of the observed fluxes with the model fluxes can only be made through broadband photometry .",
    "any attempt to determine atmospheric parameters from spectroscopic data alone should be considered extremely dangerous and will not be attempted in this analysis .",
    "for instance , the drop in the infrared flux appears much more severe in the spectrum of sdss 1337 + 00  than what is actually measured in photometry .",
    "most likely this is due to the difficulty of determining an accurate instrumental response where throughput is low .",
    "the lower panel of figure [ fg : f1 ] compares the relative energy distributions of sdss 1337 + 00  and lhs 3250  normalized at the @xmath7 bandpass .",
    "the resemblance of both objects is remarkable , and they will thus be considered together in the following model atmosphere analysis .",
    "our white dwarf model atmospheres are based on the calculations of @xcite , with the improvements described in @xcite , @xcite , and references therein ; the _ ad hoc _ pseudo - continuum opacity originating from the lyman edge , introduced by @xcite to account for some missing ultraviolet opacity , is omitted in the present calculations ( see discussion in   4 ) .",
    "the models extend down to @xmath14  k , and the atmospheric composition may vary from pure hydrogen to pure helium , or any mixed hydrogen and helium compositions .",
    "also , heavier elements can be included in the equation of state to study the indirect effects of traces of metals on the predicted fluxes .",
    "we also make use of the latest collision - induced opacity calculations by borysow and collaborators . in particular , we include the h@xmath0-he calculations described in @xcite , as well as the recent h@xmath0-h@xmath0  opacities of @xcite , which up to now had been included in our models using the approximate formalism of @xcite .",
    "these improved calculations have a significant effect on the predicted energy distributions , especially below @xmath15  k , as can be appreciated from figure [ fg : f2 ] where we compare theoretical fluxes of our pure hydrogen models at various effective temperatures for the two sets of calculations ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the absorption bands near 0.8 and 1.1  are much more pronounced than previously estimated , and this will help resolve the ambiguity between our hydrogen- and helium - rich solutions presented below .    prior to fitting each energy distribution in detail ,",
    "we explore variations of all atmospheric parameters , as we feel that such a detailed investigation has never been carried out properly in the literature .",
    "we then attempt to fit the energy distributions of sdss 1337 + 00and lhs 3250  with those predicted from our model atmospheres using a nonlinear least - squares method ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for details )",
    ". only @xmath16 and the solid angle @xmath17 , where @xmath7 is the radius of the star and @xmath18 its distance from earth , are considered free parameters .",
    "the value of @xmath19 is either assumed , or for lhs 3250 , the distance can be obtained from the trigonometric parallax measurement of @xmath20 mas @xcite , and the resulting stellar radius @xmath7 converted into mass ( and thus @xmath19 ) using evolutionary models . throughout we rely on the c / o - core cooling sequences described in @xcite with thin and thick hydrogen layers , which are based on the calculations of @xcite . at the low effective temperatures considered here",
    ", the thickness of the hydrogen layer does not affect the @xmath19 determination , only the cooling age estimates .",
    "the top panel of figure [ fg : f3 ] compares the relative energy distributions of sdss 1337 + 00  and lhs 3250",
    "normalized to unity at the @xmath7 bandpass with pure hydrogen models at @xmath21 normalized to unity at the maximum flux .",
    "this comparison shows that pure hydrogen models fail to match simultaneously the blue and infrared portions of the observed energy distributions .",
    "while the overall shape of the infrared flux distribution is qualitatively well reproduced with a model near @xmath22  k , the blue portion is predicted much too steep at that temperature .",
    "similarly , the @xmath5 and @xmath6 photometry is better reproduced with the coolest model at 1500  k , but the infrared fluxes are then predicted too low .",
    "the effects of varying the surface gravity are shown in the middle panel of figure [ fg : f3 ] for models at @xmath23  k. while the infrared fluxes are very sensitive to variations in @xmath19 , in particular near the @xmath24 bandpass , the monochromatic fluxes shortward of @xmath7 remain unaffected .",
    "experiments with different effective temperatures ( not shown here ) indicate that it is never possible to reproduce all broadband photometric observations simultaneously with pure hydrogen models .",
    "@xcite have studied the non - ideal effects of the equation of state on the atmospheric structure and broadband fluxes of pure hydrogen models ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "in order to study these effects here , we have included the equation of state of @xcite in our model calculations .",
    "our results ( not shown here ) compare well with those shown in figures 1 ( @xmath25 vs @xmath26 ) and 3 ( @xmath27  vs @xmath28 ) of @xcite .",
    "the effects on the energy distribution of a @xmath23  k , @xmath21 model are illustrated in the bottom panel of figure [ fg : f3 ] , and they are shown to be negligible , at least in the sense that the failure of the pure hydrogen models to reproduce the observations in the two upper panels is not due to the neglect of the non - ideal effects in the equation of state .    our formal fits to the optical and infrared photometry of sdss 1337 + 00  and lhs 3250  are displayed in figure [ fg : f4 ] assuming a value of @xmath21 for both stars . as discussed by @xcite , when the observed energy distribution varies considerably over the filter bandpasses  which is obviously the case here  the comparison of the model fluxes with the observed fluxes must be performed by converting the model monochromatic fluxes into _ average fluxes _ from an integration over the transmission function of the corresponding bandpasses . while both of the monochromatic and average model fluxes are shown in figure [ fg : f4 ] , only the average fluxes are used in the least - square fitting technique described above .",
    "the surface gravity for lhs 3250  inferred from the trigonometric parallax measurement is well below 7.0 , and our best fit at @xmath29 is shown in figure [ fg : f4 ] as well ; the overluminous property of lhs 3250  is discussed further below . the detailed fits shown here confirm the qualitative discussion above . _ our pure hydrogen models fail to reproduce the observed energy distribution of these two very cool white dwarfs_. in particular , the peaks of the energy distributions are predicted much narrower than observed .",
    "collision induced absorptions by molecular hydrogen may also result from collisions with neutral helium .",
    "since cool helium - rich white dwarfs tend to have lower opacities and thus higher atmospheric pressures , the infrared flux deficiency appears at higher effective temperatures in helium - rich white dwarfs than in the pure hydrogen models considered above , as can be seen in figure 9 of @xcite which shows pure hydrogen and helium - rich model sequences in the ( @xmath6@xmath24 , @xmath6@xmath30 ) two - color diagram .",
    "the two upper panels of figure [ fg : f5 ] compare the relative energy distributions of sdss 1337 + 00  and lhs 3250  with models at @xmath31  k , @xmath21 , for various atmospheric compositions , from pure hydrogen to pure helium . at that temperature",
    ", the maximum infrared absorption is reached at a hydrogen abundance of only @xmath32 ( shown in both upper panels ) ; smaller or larger hydrogen abundances yield larger infrared fluxes .",
    "a comparison of the results shown in this figure with those of figure [ fg : f3 ] indicates that the helium - rich models , for a comparable infrared depression , tend to have energy peaks that are broader than in pure hydrogen models , in better agreement with the observed energy distributions of both sdss 1337 + 00  and lhs 3250 .",
    "still , it is difficult even with helium - rich models to reconcile the optical and infrared energy distributions of these cool white dwarfs , as confirmed by our detailed fits discussed below .    in the bottom panel of figure [ fg : f5 ]",
    "we also explore the influence of traces of heavier elements on the emergent fluxes ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "model atmospheres have been calculated by including metals in the equation - of - state only .",
    "metal opacities are not taken into account as the main effect of the presence of heavy elements is to provide free electrons , and to increase the contribution of the he@xmath33 free - free opacity with respect to rayleigh scattering , otherwise the dominant source of opacity in pure helium models ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this particular experiment",
    ", we consider only calcium , the most common metal observed in dz stars .",
    "these results indicate that the shape of the energy distribution is quite sensitive to the presence of heavier elements in the atmosphere .",
    "if these cool white dwarfs do have extreme helium - rich compositions , as suggested below , the presence of metals could affect significantly the atmospheric parameter determination .",
    "our formal fits to the photometric observations of sdss 1337 + 00  and lhs 3250  using helium - rich models are shown in figure [ fg : f6 ] , again assuming @xmath21 for both stars . while those fits are somewhat better than those shown in figure [ fg : f4 ] , they are not perfect , and certainly not as convincing as those shown in @xcite or @xcite for white dwarfs only a few hundreds of degrees warmer .",
    "the peaks of the energy distributions are still predicted too sharp , and the flux in the @xmath7 band is always overestimated .",
    "experiments with models including metals have not improved the quality of the fits , and will not be discussed further .",
    "our best fit to lhs 3250  using the trigonometric parallax measurement is also displayed in figure [ fg : f6 ] , and yields a value of @xmath34 , or a mass of only 0.23 @xmath35 .",
    "such a low - mass would imply in turn that lhs 3250  has a helium core  the product of close binary evolution .",
    "however , this interpretation is at odds with the spectroscopic mass distributions of da and db stars by @xcite and @xcite , respectively , and the photometric analysis of cool white dwarfs with trigonometric parallax measurements by @xcite , which indicate that low mass white dwarfs all have hydrogen - rich atmospheres .",
    "our best solutions for lhs 3250  with pure hydrogen or mixed hydrogen / helium compositions are contrasted in figure [ fg : f7 ] , and compared with the optical spectrum .",
    "while none of our fits reproduce the observations perfectly , the optical spectrum allows us to rule out the pure hydrogen solution since the deep absorption feature near 0.8  is clearly not observed .",
    "we note that calculations with the earlier collision - induced h@xmath0  opacities of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* not shown here ) precluded us from reaching such a conclusion because the depth of the molecular bands were not predicted as deep ( see figure [ fg : f2 ] ) .",
    "we are now able to conclude with our latest model grid that both sdss 1337 + 00  and lhs 3250  are better explained in terms of extreme helium - rich compositions , despite the fact that our current model atmospheres do not yield perfect fits to the observed photometry .",
    "another argument in favor of the helium - rich solution is the overluminosity problem for lhs 3250  discussed earlier with the pure hydrogen models .",
    "this is best illustrated in figure [ fg : f8 ] where we show the location of lhs 3250  in a @xmath27 vs ( @xmath6@xmath24 ) color - magnitude diagram together with pure hydrogen and @xmath32 models at @xmath21 . while it is clearly impossible to reconcile the observed luminosity of lhs 3250  with pure hydrogen models , the helium - rich sequence is more consistent with the location of lhs 3250  in this diagram .",
    "lower gravity ( larger radii and thus larger luminosity ) models would improve the agreement even further , as indicated in figure [ fg : f8 ] where we show the predicted values of @xmath27 and ( @xmath6@xmath24 ) obtained from our best solution at @xmath34 shown in the lower panel of figure [ fg : f6 ] .",
    "the overluminosity of lhs 3250  may also suggest that these stars are unresolved degenerate binaries .",
    "we have also attempted to fit the observed energy distributions with two white dwarf models , weighted by their respective radius . despite the large number of free parameters in the possible solutions , the best fits achieved",
    "are not better than those shown in figures [ fg : f4 ] or [ fg : f6 ] and thus were not considered further .",
    "finally we show in figure [ fg : f9 ] the location of sdss 1337 + 00  and lhs 3250 in a ( @xmath6@xmath24 , @xmath6@xmath10 ) two - color diagram , together with theoretical colors from model atmospheres with various chemical compositions . also shown",
    "are the photometric data from the cool white dwarf sample of @xcite , as well as the photometry of wd 0346@xmath36246 , the low luminosity white dwarf discovered by @xcite .",
    "the variation of helium abundances is illustrated by the sequence at @xmath31  k , which performs an excursion from the pure hydrogen to a pure helium composition , reaching minimum values of @xmath6@xmath24 and @xmath6@xmath10 at @xmath37 . in this diagram , sdss 1337 + 00  is consistent with the helium - rich solution while lhs 3250  is marginally consistent with both solutions .",
    "the location of the cool white dwarf wd 0346@xmath36246 also suggests a helium - rich composition ( see discussion below ) .",
    "the extreme helium - rich composition inferred in our analysis for both sdss 1337 + 00  and lhs 3250  poses an obvious and challenging problem . because the outer layers of cool white dwarfs are strongly convective , the hydrogen and helium chemical composition tends to be more or less homogeneous throughout the mixed convection zone . since below @xmath38  k",
    ", the mass of the deep helium convection zone is almost constant at @xmath39 @xcite , the small hydrogen abundances of only @xmath40 derived in our analysis imply a _ total _ hydrogen mass of @xmath41 @xmath35 .",
    "if this amount of hydrogen has been accreted from the interstellar medium over a cooling age of roughly 10 gyr for a 3500  k white dwarf , the implied accretion rate would be only @xmath42 @xmath35  yr@xmath4 , a value that is completely unrealistic .",
    "for instance , the theoretical estimates of @xcite suggest time - averaged accretion rates of @xmath43 @xmath35yr@xmath4 .",
    "of course , the extreme helium - rich compositions derived here for sdss 1337 + 00  and lhs 3250  can not be completely ruled out on the basis of these arguments alone since the problem of the accretion of hydrogen in cool white dwarfs is a long standing one , and no satisfactory explanation has yet been proposed to account for the persistence of helium - rich white dwarfs at low effective temperatures .",
    "we note in this context that wd 0346 + 246 shown in figure [ fg : f9 ] has been interpreted by @xcite as a @xmath44  k white dwarf with an extremely small hydrogen abundance of @xmath45 .",
    "a reanalysis of this object by @xcite with the improved h@xmath0-he collision - induced opacities of @xcite indicates an even lower hydrogen abundance of @xmath46 . because this solution was improbable",
    " but not impossible  from accretion considerations , @xcite proposed an alternative solution with a higher hydrogen abundance of @xmath47 , but was also forced to introduce in the model calculations a bound - free opacity from the lyman edge associated with the so - called dissolved atomic levels of the hydrogen atom , in order to reduce the near - uv flux and match the optical photometric observations .",
    "this additional pseudo - continuum opacity has not been included in the present calculations as the uv flux is already predicted too low for sdss 1337 + 00  and lhs 3250 .    while it is probably safe to conclude that these cool white dwarfs have helium - rich atmospheres and effective temperatures below 4000  k , it is not yet possible to determine their atmospheric parameters and ages with great precision since the models fail to reproduce the photometric observations in detail .",
    "the large parameter space explored in our analysis suggests that the source of this discrepancy lies in the physics included in our model atmospheres , which is either inadequate or incomplete .",
    "one avenue of investigation worth considering is non - ideal effects of the equation - of - state at the high atmospheric pressures that characterize helium - rich atmospheres .",
    "so far , these effects have only been estimated in pure hydrogen or pure helium atmospheres ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* this paper ) .",
    "it has also been demonstrated recently by @xcite that the helium free - free opacity and rayleigh scattering at high densities typical of those encountered here are seriously overestimated .",
    "the use of their improved treatment in model atmosphere calculations would most likely increase the flux where the collision - induced opacity is less important , i.e.  for wavelengths below 0.7 , precisely in the region where we observe the largest discrepancy .",
    "this could even solve the overluminosity problem of lhs 3250  altogether as the calculated absolute visual magnitude for helium - rich white dwarfs would be brighter .",
    "all white dwarfs below @xmath15  k for which a detailed analysis has been performed have been explained in terms of some mixed hydrogen and helium atmospheric compositions , or even a pure helium composition @xcite .",
    "there are still no white dwarfs below @xmath15  k that have been successfully and convincingly explained in terms of a pure hydrogen atmospheric composition",
    ". this result may not be completely unexpected since helium - atmosphere white dwarfs with their lower opacities have cooling time scales that can be considerably shorter than their hydrogen - atmosphere counterparts ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "hence for a given population and at a given mass , the coolest white dwarfs are expected to have helium - dominated atmospheres .",
    "for instance , a cool helium - rich white dwarf at @xmath31  k ( i.e. , our temperature estimate for sdss 1337 + 00 ) with an average mass of @xmath48 @xmath35   ( see fig",
    ".  22 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has a cooling age of only 9.4 gyr according to our evolutionary models with thin hydrogen layers ( see also fig",
    ".  24 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; by comparison , a similar object with a thick hydrogen layer would have an age of 11.6 gyr .",
    "this 9.4 gyr estimate is entirely consistent with the age of the oldest objects in the galactic disk analyzed by @xcite , and the so - called ultracool white dwarfs reported in the literature may not be terribly old after all . although wd 0346@xmath36246 has kinematics supporting halo membership @xcite , lhs 3250  has a lower tangential velocity consistent with membership of either disk or halo , and sdss 1337 + 00  has an even lower velocity inconsistent with halo membership @xcite .",
    "despite the fact that we do not fully understand the accretion mechanism in cool white dwarfs , helium - atmosphere white dwarfs must eventually accrete `` some amount '' of hydrogen , at which point they will exhibit a strong infrared flux deficiency , even if the amount of hydrogen is extremely small according to our calculations .",
    "sdss 1337 + 00  and lhs 3250  are most likely such objects , and extremely cool hydrogen - atmosphere white dwarfs belonging to the old halo population of the galaxy are yet to be identified .",
    "we are grateful to h.  harris for providing us with the spectra of sdss 1337 + 00  and lhs 3250 .",
    "this work was supported in part by the nserc canada and by the fund nateq ( qubec ) .",
