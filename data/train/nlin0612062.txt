    "the problem of susceptibility of chaotic systems to perturbations has attracted much attention in the last decade [ 1 - 9 ] .",
    "this problem is fundamental , since it includes the determination of the response of a material system to an imposed external electromagnetic field , the setup that is typical for many experiments .",
    "due to the sensitivity of classical phase trajectories or quantum energy spectra and stationary wavefunctions of chaotic systems to small changes of their parameters , the problem is challengingly difficult . a consistent and noncontroversial picture covering ( albeit qualitatively ) all the essential cases of the response hasnt been yet drawn at present . from the point of view of general theory ,",
    "the problem is related to the applicability of the concept of quantum - classical correspondence to chaotic systems , that is a long - standing question in its own right @xcite .",
    "we shall study a one - particle system with the hamiltonian of the form @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the hamiltonian of the unperturbed system ; @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the operators of cartesian components of the momentum and of the position of the particle .",
    "the classical system with the hamiltonian function @xmath5 will be assumed to be strongly chaotic , that is , nearly ergodic on the energy surfaces in a wide range of the energy values , system with @xmath6 degrees of freedom . in the perturbation operator @xmath7 the active variable @xmath8",
    "is one of the cartesian coordinates of the particle , coupled to the external homogeneous force field . the amplitude @xmath9 in the following will be referred to as the field . in the following",
    "we shall deal with the quasiclassical case , when the planck constant @xmath10 is small in comparison of the action scale of the system @xmath11 .    under the influence of the perturbation the energy value @xmath12 varies in a quasirandom way .",
    "these variations can be frequently described as a process of the energy diffusion @xcite , when for the ensemble with the microcanonical initial energy distribution @xmath13 the dispersion of the energy increases linearly with time , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the energy diffusion coefficient .",
    "if the external field @xmath9 is sufficiently small in comparison with the appropriately averaged values of the forces acting on a particle in the unperturbed system , then in the classical model the energy diffusion coefficient @xmath16 can be expressed through the characteristics of the unperturbed chaotic motion of the active coordinate , namely @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the power spectrum of the active coordinate ( the fourier transform of its autocorrelation function ) for the motion on the surface with the constant energy value @xmath19 [ 9 ] . the same expression ( 1 ) in the case of weak perturbation can be obtained in the classical limit from the quantum model .",
    "the evolution of the quantum system can be treated as a sequence of one - photon transitions between stationary states of the unperturbed system @xmath20 , accompanied with the absorption or emission of the quanta @xmath21 .",
    "for small @xmath10 the energy spectrum of @xmath22 is quasicontinuous , thence the rates of transition are given by the fermi golden rule ( fgr ) @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the matrix element of the active coordinate , and @xmath25 is the density of states near the final state of the transition .",
    "although the matrix elements @xmath24 in quantum chaotic systems fluctuate wildly with the variation of @xmath26 [ 10 , 11 ] , the averaged squared quantity @xmath27 in the limit @xmath28 is smooth ; it is proportional to the power spectrum @xmath29 of the coordinate @xcite , @xmath30 from eqs . ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) we have for the transition rate @xmath31 then for the energy dispersion for small @xmath32 we have @xmath33 , that returns us to the eq .",
    "( 1 ) for the energy diffusion coefficient .",
    "it can be shown that the same expression for @xmath16 holds also for large @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "the energy absorption in chaotic systems comes as an epiphenomenon of the energy diffusion [ 4 ] . with the account of the dependence on the energy of the power spectrum @xmath34 and the density of states",
    "@xmath35 the diffusion becomes biased , and the energy absorption rate @xmath36 is given by the formula @xcite @xmath37    although for weak fields @xmath16 does not depend on the planck constant @xmath10 , the condition of the applicability of eq .",
    "( 2 ) does .",
    "the fgr is , after all , only a formula of the first order perturbation theory .",
    "it is based on the assumption that the transition process has a resonant character - that the width @xmath38 of the energy distribution of states populated from the original one , given by the weisskopf - wigner formula @xmath39 @xcite , is small in comparison with the quanta energy @xmath21 . from eq .",
    "( 4 ) it is evident that in the classical limit @xmath28 this condition will be violated . in the following",
    "we shall use the border value of the field @xmath40 , defined by the condition @xmath41 , and refer to the domain @xmath42 as the range of the strong field .    by analogy with other models , for strong fields one can expect a slow - down of the growth of the energy diffusion coefficient @xmath16 and of the energy absorption rate @xmath36 .",
    "for example , for a two - level system with relaxation the quadratic dependence the absorption rate @xmath43 for small field turns into a field - independent value @xmath44 for strong one .",
    "the border is determined by the condition @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the rabi frequency and @xmath47 are longitudinal and transversal relaxation rates correspondingly @xcite .",
    "the rate of transitions from discrete to continuous energy spectrum ( that are basically covariant with the energy absorption rate @xmath36 ) , studied in the context of the theory of photoionization , for sufficiently strong fields can even decrease with the increase of @xmath9 - the effect that is known as atom stabilization by the strong field @xcite .",
    "the slow - down of the energy diffusion in strong harmonic fields for the model of quantum chaotic systems with random uncorrelated matrix elements has been first demonstrated by cohen and kottos @xcite . a different approach @xcite has lead to qualitatively the same results .",
    "this slow - down destroys the quantum - classical correspondence .",
    "it has been demonstrated by kottos and cohen @xcite that for the first - principles model that is constructed by the quantization of the hamiltonian of a classically chaotic system , the response to a sudden change of the ( otherwise ) stationary hamiltonian measured by the energy spreading restores its classical behaviour for sufficiently small values of @xmath10 in contrast with the model with random independent matrix elements .",
    "the purpose of the present article is to study this phenomenon for the harmonically driven system .",
    "the system chosen is the pullen - edmonds oscillator @xcite , that describes the two - dimensional motion of a particle in the quartic potential .",
    "the hamiltonian of this system is @xmath48 in the following we use the particle mass @xmath49 , the frequency of small oscillations @xmath50 , and the nonlinearity length @xmath51 as unit scales , and write all equations in dimensionless form .",
    "the properties of chaotic motion of the pullen - edmonds model are thoroughly studied @xcite . with the increase of energy",
    "the system becomes more chaotic both in extensive ( that is characterized by the measure of the chaotic component @xmath52 on the surface of poincare section ) and in intensive ( that is measured by the magnitude of the lyapunov exponent @xmath53 ) aspects . for values of energy",
    "@xmath54 the measure @xmath55 , and chaos dominates in the phase space ; for @xmath56 the chaotic motion of the system is approximately ergodic @xcite .",
    "the matrix of the quantum hamiltonian operator of the model eq .",
    "( 6 ) has been calculated in the basis of the unperturbed two - dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator for the value @xmath57 . due to the symmetry of the system the submatrices with different parities of the quantum numbers @xmath58 and @xmath59",
    "can be diagonalized separately .    by expanding the wavefunction of the system @xmath60 in the basis of the eigenstates @xmath61 of the system",
    "@xmath62 @xmath63 we obtain for the amplitudes @xmath64 the system of equations @xmath65 where the quantities @xmath66 are the rabi frequencies of transitions .",
    "this system has been solved numerically for the 2352 amplitudes of the eigenstates with `` even - even '' and `` odd - even '' parities of @xmath58 and @xmath59 that include all states of these classes with energies in the band @xmath67 .    for the initial conditions in the runs with different values of @xmath9 and @xmath68",
    "we have used the same normalized narrow wavepacket with randomly chosen real amplitudes @xmath69 with the complexity ( inverse participation ratio ) @xmath70 , the mean initial energy @xmath71 and the initial energy dispersion @xmath72 .    to expose the role of correlations of the matrix elements @xmath73 on the energy kinetics we compare the properties of the `` natural '' system with its `` randomized '' analog with the matrix elements @xmath74 , where @xmath75 are the elements of a symmetric matrix that take values 1 or -1 at random with equal probabilities .",
    "this randomization , that has been introduced in @xcite , destroys the correlation of matrix elements .",

    ", the numerical dependence was fitted by the law of evolution of the energy dispersion for the diffusion equation with the constant @xmath16 on the interval @xmath80 with impenetrable walls on the borders and the initial condition in the form of the @xmath81 peak .",
    "this dependence can be described ( with the local accuracy better than 3% ) by the formula @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",

    "( 9 ) with the numerical data are shown in the fig . 1 by solid lines",
    ". the initial moment @xmath85 has been used as the third fitting parameter .",
    "for once , it is clearly seen that the randomization suppresses the process of the energy diffusion .",
    "secondly , for the natural model one can see the presence of two different regimes - a fast initial diffusion sharply slows down at a crossover time @xmath86 .",
    "we note that at this moment the energy dispersion @xmath87 is much less than the saturated value @xmath88 , that corresponds to the uniform probability distribution throughout the band of the states taken into account . to understand what happens at the crossover time we have to study more closely the time development of the probability distribution .",
    "the overall form of the energy distribution for the natural model is rather accurately approximated by the gaussian form that follows from the model of the energy diffusion with the constant @xmath16 .",
    "this agreement can be seen in fig .",

    "the black stars note the maxima of the ballistic bumps ( see the text),title=\"fig : \" ]    .",
    "the peak at @xmath96 corresponds to the part of the initial packet that is not depleted yet by the energy spreading .",
    "two bumps are clearly seen in the picture : their maxima are located at @xmath97 .",
    "the calculations show that these bumps propagate outwards with a constant speed , that is ballistically .",
    "the crossover time corresponds to the moment when these bumps reach the borders of the treated band of states .",
    "therefore , only the part of the graph that precedes the @xmath98 corresponds to the properties of the model ; the second part is just an artifact of the calculation scheme . to estimate the diffusion coefficient we fitted the dependence of the initial state by the two - parameter formula @xmath99 where the time shift @xmath100 accounts for the duration of the initial stage , where the law of the dispersion growth is always quadratic .",
    "the best fitted function @xmath101 is plotted in fig . 1 by the dashed line .",
    "the ballistic spreading of the energy distribution in the time domain @xmath102 is well known for the model of a one - dimensional resonantly excited harmonic oscillator with the hamiltonian @xmath103 . in the quasiclassical domain ( for large quantum numbers @xmath104 )",

    "equation ( 11 ) yields for the energy dispersion @xmath113 however , the randomization of signs of matrix elements does not influence the energy kinetics in this model .",

    "the energy spreading is ballistic , @xmath123 , whereas the randomization of signs leads to the localization of the quasienergy states , and the energy dispersion growth saturates .",
    "one can suppose that the ballistic component in the quantum chaotic model is carried through the subset of states that are similar to the `` double ladder '' model .",

    "the correlation index @xmath125 can be defined as the ratio of the average value of @xmath126 for the randomized system to that of the natural system . for the `` double ladder '' model we have @xmath127 the relatively large value of this number",

    "the value of the correlation index @xmath129 is rather close to that of the `` double ladder '' model ; that makes the analogy plausible .",
    "it must be stressed that the combined effect of the bulk diffusion spreading and the overlaying ballistic bumps propagation produces the _ linear _ growth of the energy dispersion ( see fig.1 ) that will be referred to as the effective diffusion .",

    "the 20% of the largest terms come with 82% contribution to the average .",
    "these large contributions come from the bits of the trajectories in which the point oscillates almost along the direction of the perturbing force nearly synchronously with the perturbation .",

    "thus we can indicate a classical counterpart to the quantum dynamics of energy growth .",
    "the quantum ballistic bumps are analogous to the nearly resonant bits of the classical trajectories with the quasiballistic energy increase .",
    "by the numerical studies of the evolution of the energy distribution in a harmonic external field in a system constructed by the quantization of a classically chaotic hamiltonian system , thus retaining all correlations of the matrix elements , we have found that the effective rate of the energy diffusion preserve its quadratical dependence on the field strength on the domain of the strong field , where the transition rate is comparable to the perturbation frequency .",
    "in other words , the fermi golden rule appears to be valid far beyond the limits of the domain in which its applicability can be justified .",
    "this circumstance restores the quantum - classical correspondence for the energy diffusion and the energy absorption rate in the limit @xmath0 .",
    "we have to admit that our studies are limited to a specific model , studied for two values of the perturbation frequency .",
    "however the revealed mechanism of the ballistic component of the energy distribution that propagates through the chains of matrix elements with the correlated signs can be admitted as a universal , especially with the account of the important contribution of the quasiballistic parts of the trajectories to the energy diffusion in the classical model .",
    "the more rigorous proof of the universality demands further studies .",
