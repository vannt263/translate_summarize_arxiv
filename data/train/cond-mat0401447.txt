    "the superconducting ( sc ) condensate , one of the essentail parameters for a superconductor , has been a subject of discussion in high-@xmath10 superconducting cuprates(htsc ) .",
    "the recent progress in scanning tunneling spectroscopy has revealed a strange inhomogeneous distribution of the gap in bi@xmath4sr@xmath4cacu@xmath4o@xmath11 ( bscco)@xcite .",
    "the effect of this real - space gap inhomogeneity on a superconducting ( sc ) condensate is unclear . on the other hand ,",
    "the angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) has demonstrated a distinct @xmath12-dependence of the gap at the fermi surface in the pseudo - gap state or the stripe ordered state@xcite .",
    "for the system with such a partially gapped fermi surface , the source of sc condensate is not obvious .    as one of the direct methods to detect a sc gap and the weight of sc condensate , optical studies have been extensively performed for htsc .",
    "a clear conductivity depression was observed below @xmath13500 @xmath5 in yba@xmath4cu@xmath14o@xmath15 ( ybco)@xcite and bscco@xcite .",
    "then , the weight of sc condensate ( @xmath16 was estimated from the missing area ( @xmath17 ) of the real part @xmath18 of conductivity spectrum or from the low - frequency behavior of its imaginary part @xmath19 .",
    "the estimate of sc condensate from optical spectra , however , has been subject to uncertainty .",
    "one of the reasons is that , unlike the case of conventional superconductors , there often remains some conductivity below the gap energy , forming a drude - like increase towards @xmath8=0@xcite .",
    "since the missing area of @xmath20 is large in ybco and bscco , the remaining conductivity effect is relatively small in estimation of sc condensate .",
    "by contrast , in the case of lower @xmath10-htsc such as la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 ( lsco ) , it must give more serious effect .",
    "nevertheless , this residual conductivity was ignored in most of the previous estimate of sc condensate except for a few works@xcite .",
    "the origin of this remaining conductivity is an important problem to be solved .",
    "the other reason for the difficulty in determining sc condensate of lsco is linked to the difficulty in obtaining a pure in - plane spectrum . since the early stage of htsc research , various different in - plane spectra",
    "have been reported for lsco@xcite and la@xmath4cuo@xmath21@xcite . some of the reported in - plane spectra show rich features in a far - infrared ( fir ) region @xcite , which are ascribed either to the lo - phonons@xcite or to the excitation related to the polarons@xcite . according to the variety of spectra , different values of the sc condensate were derived , ranging from 250 to 430 nm@xcite in terms of the london penetration depth @xmath22(=1/2@xmath23 ) , which do not correlate with the @xmath10 -value of the studied sample .",
    "some of them are considerably different from the value determined by @xmath9sr measurements@xcite .",
    "the purpose of this work is two - fold .",
    "the first one is to clarify the origin of such a confusing situation in optical study of lsco .",
    "we report a purely in - plane polarized spectrum of lsco and demonstrate the effect of the @xmath24-axis component mixing , by comparing with the `` dirty '' spectra contaminated by the @xmath24-axis component .",
    "possible reasons for the @xmath24-axis component mixing are discussed .",
    "the second and main purpose is to examine the electrodynamic response in the low energy region and to estimate the sc condensate , based on the purely in - plane polarized optical spectra of la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 ( x=0.12 and 0.15 ) .",
    "the spectra were measured over a wide range of frequency 8 - 30000 @xmath5 , down to the sub - millimeter region . at @xmath25 ,",
    "we have found a depression of conductivity below 200 @xmath5 ( 70 @xmath5 ) for x=0.15 ( x=0.12 ) but a steep increase of the conductivity below 40 cm @xmath26(10 @xmath5 ) , which leads to a significantly small missing area compared to the value estimated from the london length @xmath27 determined by @xmath9sr measurement .",
    "we conclude that a discrepancy of the sc condensate between the optical and @xmath9sr - estimations is commonly observed in many htsc .",
    "possible scenarios for these anomalous features are discussed .",
    "single crystals of la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 with x=0.12 and 0.15 were grown by a traveling solvent - floating zone ( tsfz ) method .",
    "the superconducting transition temperature t@xmath28 is 36k for x=0.15 and 30k for x=0.12 .",
    "fixing crystal axes by observing x - ray laue patterns at the surface of as - grown crystal rods , we cut the crystals along the @xmath24-axis and took several pieces of samples with a thickness of about 2 mm .",
    "we call them `` @xmath29-face '' sample hereafter . for comparison",
    ", we also cut some crystal pieces with the @xmath24-axis perpendicular to the measurement surfaces called `` @xmath30-face '' sample . in both cases ,",
    "@xmath31- and @xmath32-axes are not distinguished although there is a small difference between them . after a number of trial measurements of far - infrared spectra",
    ", we realized that even laue - characterized crystals were sometimes multi - domains , showing the @xmath24-axis phonon admixture .",
    "the second characterization method to detect multi - domain is to observe the surface using a polarized optical microscope . prior to this observation",
    ", the sample surfaces were polished with al@xmath4o@xmath14 powder of different particle sizes at several steps .",
    "the particle diameter for the final polishing was 0.3 @xmath9 m .",
    "it was found that some pieces of crystals consisted of multi - domains .",
    "we carefully selected the single domain crystals for measurement of purely in - plane polarized spectrum .",
    "a typical diameter of the sample disks is about 5 mm .",
    "a spot size of the incident light is about 3 mm , well smaller than the sample size .",
    "optical reflectivity spectra were measured using a coherent - source spectrometer@xcite in a millimeter and sub - millimeter wavelength region ( 8 - 33 @xmath5 ) , a fourier transformation type spectrometer for infrared region ( 30 - 8000 @xmath5 ) and a grating type one for higher energy region above near - infrared ( 4000 - 30000 cm-1 ) .",
    "both a sample and a gold mirror were mounted on a copper plate in a he - gas flow cryostat for temperature control . before each measurement of a sample spectrum ,",
    "a spectrum of gold mirror was measured as a reference .",
    "reflectance of polarized light was measured with the s - polarized geometry at the incident angle of about 5 degree .    in order to compare the sc condensate estimated from the other experimental methods , we measured the london penetration depth using muon spin rotation ( @xmath9sr ) technique . to improve the reliability of the missing area analysis and discussion ,",
    "the @xmath9sr measurement has been carried out on the same single crsytal as used in the optical study .",
    "the analysis of the field distribution of a vortex lattice in the applied transverse field @xmath33=0.2 @xmath34 has been performed using a london model @xcite with a lorentzian cut - off@xcite of 4.5 - 6.5 nm as a non - local correction .",
    "other possible contributions for the broadening of the field distribution , such as random pinning , are corrected by assuming an additional gaussian relaxation with the relaxation rate 0.39 - 0.43 mhz .",
    "figure 1 shows the far - infrared reflectivity spectra at room temperature for several samples .",
    "lsc#1 is the almost perfectly in - plane polarized spectrum for the @xmath29-face of la@xmath35sr@xmath36cuo@xmath2 crystal , while lsc#2 , the spectrum for another @xmath29-face la@xmath35sr@xmath36cuo@xmath2 crystal , shows the bumps centered at around 300 @xmath5 and 520 @xmath5 .",
    "lnsc#1 , measured without polarizer for the @xmath30-face of la@xmath37nd@xmath38sr@xmath36cuo@xmath2 , also shows a similar bump - like feature at the same position .",
    "compared to the @xmath24-polarized spectrum ( @xmath39 ) in fig.1 , these bumps can be assigned to the two a@xmath40 mode phonons with the to - frequencies of 240 @xmath5 and 500 @xmath5 that are the @xmath24-axis vibration modes of oxygens@xcite .",

    "the admixture of the @xmath24-axis spectral component into the in - plane spectrum seriously influences the conductivity and scattering rate spectra calculated from the reflectivity spectrum via kramers - kronig ( kk ) transformation . as shown in fig.2(a ) , the @xmath24-component admixture creates the conductivity dip between 300 and 1000 @xmath5 and the peak around 500 cm @xmath26 .",
    "these additional features were observed in both of conductivity and reflectivity spectra for the previous studies of lsco@xcite and la@xmath4cuo@xmath21 @xcite , which clearly indicates the admixture of the @xmath24-axis component .",
    "figure 2(b ) demonstrates that the double peak in 1/@xmath48 ) reported by startseva _",
    "et al._@xcite can also be considered as the same admixture effect .     of la@xmath35sr@xmath36cuo@xmath2 ( lsc#1 ) and",

    "( b ) comparison of the scattering rate 1/@xmath49 for lsc#1 and the @xmath24-axis component admixture case .",
    "it is clear that the double peak is a result of the @xmath24-component admixture .",
    "it is also demonstrated that the kink at @xmath13700 @xmath5 even at 300k and is independent of the superconducting response below 200 @xmath5.,width=226 ]    there are several possible reasons for the @xmath24-axis component mixing , such as ( i)mis - cut of crystals , ( ii)multi - domains in as - grown crystals , ( iii)@xmath50-polarization admixture in non - polarized measurement .",
    "mis - cut of as - grown crystal is the most primitive mistake that gives a mis - oriented surface for reflectivity measurement .",
    "this problem is peculiar to the lsco crystals , because the cutting procedure is inevitable for extracting an appropriate size sample from an as - grown crystal rod . in the case of ybco crystals grown by a flux method",
    ", natural surfaces can be used for optical measurement , and the bscco crystals grown by a tsfz method are so easily cleaved that crystal cutting is not necessary to extract the @xmath30-face samples .",
    "the multi - domain problem is serious in the tsfz crystals .",
    "it often appears in the early stage of crystal growth , namely , in the crystal portion close to a seed .",
    "it is hard to confirm that a sample is of single domain by a usual x - ray laue pattern measurement , because a typical x - ray spot size is much smaller than the sample surface area of about 3x3 mm@xmath51 .",
    "this was the case for lsc#2 . in order to scan the whole area of sample surface ,",
    "we need an x - ray topography measurement . an easier way to examine the existence of multi - domain feature is to observe a polished sample surface using a polarized optical microscope . in the worst case ,",
    "even the sample selected by this method shows some admixture of different direction component in its far - infrared spectrum . the mis - oriented domain behind the surface within a penetration depth ( @xmath13 1 @xmath9 m ) of far - infrared light is a possible origin .",
    "the dielectric response of the light penetrating through multi - domains must be complicated , giving an unusual structure in far - infrared spectra .",
    "the obtained reflectivity can not merely be interpreted as a weighted summation of the in - plane component @xmath42 and the @xmath24-axis component @xmath43 in this case .",
    "the final problem related to the @xmath50-polarization must be considered when we measure the in - plane spectrum on the @xmath30-face using non - polarized light . in order to gain a signal",
    ", we sometimes did not use a polarizer for the @xmath30-face measurement because the light intensity is reduced to about a half when going through a polarizer .",
    "however , this geometry measurement always gave a weak bump - like feature that roughly corresponds to the @xmath24-axis phonon peak or high - frequency reflectivity suppression .",
    "an example is shown in fig.1(a ) as lnsc#1 for the @xmath30-face of ( la , nd , sr)@xmath4cuo@xmath2 crystal which was well characterized by an x - ray diffraction .",
    "a similar problem can be seen in the set of data by lucarelli _",
    "_ @xcite about a half of the seven spectra were measured on the @xmath30-face without a polarizer , and they show a clear peak corresponding to the @xmath24-axis phonon@xcite . the most plausible origin of this @xmath24-axis component mixing is the @xmath50-polarization component in the non - polarized light , as van der marel _",
    "_ pointed out @xcite .",
    "although the introduced @xmath24-component is very small if the surface is perfectly @xmath30-oriented , the effect possibly becomes evident in extremely anisotropic materials like htsc .",
    "all the problems due to the @xmath24-axis component mixing become serious only in strongly anisotropic systems , namely , when the reflectivity values are remarkably different in the @xmath30- and @xmath24-polarized spectra .",
    "this is well demonstrated in the optical spectra of intentionally mis - alighed films of ( la , ce)@xmath4cuo@xmath2@xcite , where only 1 degree mis - orientation results in a clear feature of the @xmath24-axis phonons in the spectra .",
    "this remarkable effect is due to the completely insulating spectral profile for @xmath39 .",
    "in fact , less anisotropic materials such as well - oxygenated ybco have never shown the @xmath24-axis component in the spectrum measured with the in - plane polarized light .",
    "therefore , the measurement of in - plane spectrum for lsco and probably ( nd , ce)@xmath4cuo@xmath2 requires particularly high quality samples without any multi - domain feature , high accuracy in cutting angle and careful polarization measurements .",
    "these requirements are quite sever , compared to that for other measurement techniques such as neutron scattering .",

    "the fir reflectance is smoothly connected to the sub - millimeter reflectance as shown in the inset of fig.3(a ) .",

    "next , we calculate @xmath92 ) corresponding to @xmath93 ) using a kk - relation .",
    "then , the @xmath94 ) which should represent the  true  superfluid response is obtained as @xmath94 ) = @xmath95 ) .",
    "the obtained @xmath94 ) is proportional to 1/@xmath8 both for x=0.12 and 0.15 , indicating a sc response in this frequency range .",
    "the sc condensates giving @xmath22=990 nm for x=0.12 and 590 nm for x=0.15 are estimated from the slopes , respectively .",
    "these are in agreement with the values ( 1 @xmath9 m for x=0.12 and 530 nm for x=0.15 ) obtained from the missing area in @xmath6 ) .",
    "it means that this method for estimation of sc condensate is self - consistent within the optical spectra , and thus it is concluded that the fgt sum rule almost holds within an infrared frequency range .",
    "the present result does not completely exclude a possibility of small contribution from the high-@xmath8 region , namely , the kinetic energy contribution to the condensate weight , as was observed in bscco@xcite , but it is beyond the accuracy of our measurement .    the previously reported values of @xmath22 for the optimally doped lsco range from 250 nm to 430 nm , depending on the sample and the research group but not on the @xmath10-value .",
    "the value estimated from the spectrum showing the @xmath24-axis component@xcite is not reliable , because the @xmath24-axis admixture modifies the conductivity spectrum as demonstrated in fig.1 .",
    "in fact , the estimated @xmath22s from their data are shorter than ours .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     another point to judge the data quality is whether the low-@xmath8 drude - like component is observed and taken into account or not .",
    "if the remaining conductivity in the sc state is ignored , the missing area must be overestimated . the relatively larger missing area ( or equivalently the shorter @xmath22=250 nm ) , reported in the paper by gao@xcite may partly result from this over - estimation of the missing area , because the 5k-@xmath6 ) was set to zero below 70 @xmath5 .",
    "the measurement by gorshunov _",
    "@xcite on the la@xmath59sr@xmath60cuo@xmath2 film ( @xmath10=39.5k)@xcite , which covered the frequency range down to 5 @xmath5 , clearly detected a narrow drude - like band with the large weight @xmath967800 @xmath5 at 5k . subtracting the drude - like spectral contribution by fitting , they obtained a long penetration depth @xmath22 = 400 nm .",
    "a little longer penetration depth @xmath22=430 nm was reported by somal _",
    "et al._@xcite for a single crystal .",
    "these values are in fairly good agreement with our estimate of the shorter limit of @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the spectra successfully measured without contamination of the @xmath24-axis component give a similar value of @xmath27 ( 400 - 500 nm ) that is longer than the estimate ( 250 - 310 nm ) from the contaminated spectra .    the microwave ( mw ) conductivity measurement gives a similar large value ( = @xmath97=400@xmath79100 nm for x=0.15 ) to our fir result , although the error bar is quite large in this technique@xcite .",
    "by contrast , the @xmath9sr penetration depth @xcite is clearly shorter than the fir and microwave values . for x=0.12 , our estimate from the fir data is @xmath22=990 nm , the recent fir data for x=0.125 by dumm _ et al._@xcite shows @xmath22=630 nm , and",
    "the microwave data for x=0.12 is @xmath97=500@xmath79200 nm @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath22 as well as @xmath10 is very sensitive to the sr - content x around x=0.12 owing to the so - called 1/8-anomaly ( @xmath10 is most suppressed when x is tuned to 0.115 ) . even if taking into account this situation",
    ", we can conclude that the values of @xmath22 are much longer than the @xmath9sr estimate @xmath76=310 nm .    a similar discrepancy between the fir- and the @xmath9sr - penetration depths is also seen in the case of ybco and bscco particularly in the underdoped regime . in the optimally doped ybco , the average value of @xmath31- and @xmath32-polarized data ( @xmath22=160 nm for @xmath53 and 117 nm for @xmath98)@xcite is larger than the @xmath9sr value [ @xmath99=112 nm@xcite ] . comparing the conductivity spectra of optimally and under - doped ybco@xcite , we find that the missing area of @xmath57 in the underdoped ybco with @xmath10=56 - 59k is about 20% of that for the optimally doped one with @xmath10=93k .",
    "this suggests the penetration depth of about 300 - 400 nm for the underdoped ybco . the recent estimation of @xmath22 by subtracting the low-@xmath8 residual conductivity is about 250 nm for yba@xmath4cu@xmath14o@xmath100@xcite .",
    "this is much longer than the @xmath9sr value ( @xmath76 = 170 nm)@xcite .",
    "a longer fir penetration depth is also reported for underdoped bscco with @xmath10=70k@xcite .",
    "compared with the @xmath9sr penetration depth ( @xmath13190 nm ) for bscco with @xmath10=75k@xcite , the reported value of @xmath22 ( = 680 nm ) for the @xmath10=70k sample@xcite is extremely long . we summarize the comparison of the fir- and @xmath9sr - penetration depths for various htsc in table i. as is clearly seen in the table , the discrepancy between the fir and @xmath9sr data is quite robust for htsc .",
    "one may consider the possibility that a fir spectrum is not correctly measured by some reason , for example , by the [ 110 ] surface giometry problem arising from the @xmath101-wave symmetric gap , as recently pointed out by tu _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "it is , however , unlikely because a small estimate of sc condensate was obtained by various measurements with various surface giometries .",
    "it is also a general trend that the discrepancy becomes larger as one goes to more underdoped regime .",
    "this is suggestive of electronic inhomogeneity as a possible origin of the discrepancy .",
    "the sc order parameter may not be uniform in real sapce and vanish in some parts , according to the recent observation of stm on bscco@xcite . in lsco",
    ", the stripe fluctuation may introduce electronic inhomogeneity .",
    "as we discuss below , the presence of non - superconducting area appears to be correlated with the residual conductivity in the sc state , which is responsible partly for the reduced missing area in @xmath6 ) .",
    "a distinct difference from the @xmath9sr results was recognaized in the impurity - substituted ybco@xcite , yba@xmath4cu@xmath2o@xmath11 and many other disordered htsc@xcite .",
    "disorder , impurity or defect , decreases the fir sc condensate ( @xmath102 at much steeper rate than that expected from the linear @xmath10-@xmath103 relationship observed by @xmath9sr .",
    "for example , 0.4% zn - substitution for optimally doped ybco suppresses @xmath10 from 93k to 85k and duplicates @xmath22 ( @xmath13340 nm for @xmath104 ) , while @xmath76 is expected to increase only 20% at most by the same zn - substitution@xcite .",
    "the discrepancy between the fir and @xmath9sr data seems to be universal in the disordered or inhomogeneous cuprates , including the underdoped cuprates for which stm suggests an inherent spatial modulation of the sc order parameter over a lenght scales of a few nm .",
    "it may follow that the fir measurement is more sensitive to microscopic inhomogeneity than @xmath9sr , and that the ordinary relationship between @xmath105 and @xmath27 ( @xmath106 ) no more holds for such microscopically inhomogeneous sc - state .",
    "finally we discuss the residual conductivity in the sc state .",
    "the drude - like up - turn of conductivity towards @xmath8=0 is observed almost in all htsc even at @xmath66 well below @xmath10@xcite . in the present study , the low-@xmath8 drude - like",
    "spectral weigh at @xmath25 is smaller for x=0.12 than for x=0.15 , the drude - like peak width being narrower in the former .",
    "this is consistent with the general trend that the spectral weight of the residual conductivity increases with doping@xcite .",
    "the low-@xmath8 conductivity remaining at @xmath25 is an indication of the presence of non - superconducting region .",
    "so far known are three types of inhomogeneous state in htsc : ( i ) presence of non - sc region within the sc area , either metallic as speculated for overdoped cuprates by fir@xcite and @xmath9sr measurements@xcite or pseudogapped as observed by stm for underdoped bscco@xcite , ( ii ) alternating array of anti - ferromagnetic ( af ) and sc stripes@xcite , ( iii ) local suppresion of the sc order around impurities such as zn , as was directly observed by stm@xcite .",
    "the impurity - induced inhomogeneity [ the case ( iii ) ] has been investigated by many experimental techniques . in the optical spectra",
    ", zn - substitution creates a huge residual conductivity , which dramatically depresses the missing area@xcite .",
    "a similar observation was reported for the zn - doped yba@xmath4cu@xmath2o@xmath11@xcite and in the irradiated ybco@xcite , giving the evidence for the sensitiveness of the fir probe to microscopic inhomogeneity .    the case ( ii )",
    ", the spin and charge stripe order can be considered as an  ordered  inhomogeneous state , which has been detected by neutron scattering experiment as a static order in ( la , nd , sr)@xmath4cuo@xmath2@xcite , and probably as a dynamical form in lsco@xcite , where the sr - content x=0.12(@xmath131/8 ) is expected to be closer to the static order . in this case , the charge stripes on which sc oreder might develop are separated by the af spin domains , and would form a periodic josephson coupled array . a weak spatial modulation of the josephson coupling strength between the stripes , due to e.g. stripe meandering , is a possible source of the low-@xmath8 conductivity peak , as was observed in the @xmath24-axis optical response@xcite .",
    "when the josephson coupling strength is increased and strongly modulated spatially by decreasing an average spacing between stripes and/or by enhanced stripe fluctuation , the weight of residual conductivity would increase and be distributed over a fairly wide frequency range .",
    "the in - plane polarized spectra of lsco with x=0.12 and 0.15 were carefully measured .",
    "the peak at @xmath13500 @xmath5 that was observed in the previous reports and/or in some of our samples was assigned to the @xmath24-axis phonon mode ( @xmath107 ) .",
    "various possible sources for this admixture of @xmath24-axis spectral component were examined .",
    "inaccurate angle of crystal cutting and/or multi - domains in the tsfz - crystals possibly introduces some amount of the dielectric response for @xmath108 .",
    "measurement on @xmath30-face with non - polarized light or with @xmath50-polarization geometry also results in the @xmath24-axis component mixing . in any case",
    ", the problem originates from the large anisotropy in the electronic system of lsco where only a small amount of @xmath24-axis component makes a serious effect on the in - plane spectrum , and therefore , this is the problem peculiar to a strongly anisotropic material like lsco .",
    "the obtained pure @xmath31/@xmath32-axis spectrum showed a clear superconducting response , the suppression of @xmath6 ) and 1/@xmath8-behavior of @xmath7 ) . the estimation both from @xmath57 and @xmath90 give a consistent value of sc condensate , which indicates that the kinetic energy contribution is not appreciable .",
    "we find that the sc condesate is much smaller than that determined by @xmath9sr .",
    "this discrepancy is possibly caused by microscopic inhomogeneity in the electronic state of supercnducting cuo@xmath4-planes , probably related to the stripe fluctuation in the case of lsco .",
    "it is guessed that fir - measurement is a probe sensitive to disorder which suppresses the sc order parameters over a length scale of nano - meter .",
    "the inhomogeneous electronic state also seems to manifest in the spectrum as a residual drude - like response at very low frequencies below 50 @xmath5 in the sc state .",

    "<S> temperature dependences of the optical spectra of la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 with @xmath3=0.12 and 0.15 were carefully examined for a polarization parallel to the cuo@xmath4-plane over a wide frequency range down to 8 @xmath5 . </S>",

    "<S> the weight of superconducting ( sc ) condensate estimated from the missing area in @xmath6 ) well agrees with the estimate from the slope of @xmath7 ) vs 1/@xmath8 plot , showing no evidence that the ferrell - glover - tinkham sum - rule is violated in the optical spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the optically estimated sc condensate is much smaller than the value obtained from the @xmath9sr measurement of magnetic penetration depth . </S>",
    "<S> we also find an anomalous increase of conductivity in sub - millimeter region towards @xmath8=0 below @xmath10 , which suggests the microscopic inhomogeneity in the superconducting state . </S>",
    "<S> both observations are discussed in relation with the inhomogeneous electronic state that might be inherent to high-@xmath10 cuprates . </S>"
