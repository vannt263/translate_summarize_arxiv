    "in this paper we consider the lens and scattering rigidity of a number of compact surfaces with boundary that have a trapped geodesic . a trapped geodesic ray is a geodesic @xmath0 which is defined for all @xmath1 , while a trapped geodesic is one defined for all @xmath2 .",
    "we will call a unit vector trapped if it is tangent to a geodesic ray while we call it totally trapped if it is tangent to a trapped geodesic .",
    "we will consider compact two dimensional manifolds @xmath3 with boundary @xmath4 and metric @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath6 represent the space of inwardly pointing unit vectors at the boundary .",
    "that is , @xmath7 means that @xmath8 is a unit vector based at a boundary point and @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the unit vector of @xmath11 normal to @xmath4 and pointing inward .",
    "@xmath12 will represent the outward vectors .",
    "these spaces are two dimensional while @xmath13 the unit tangent bundle of @xmath4 is one dimensional .    for @xmath7 let @xmath14 be the geodesic with @xmath15 .",
    "we let @xmath16 $ ] ( the travel time ) be the first time @xmath17 when @xmath14 hits the boundary again .",
    "if @xmath14 never hits the boundary again then @xmath18 , while if either @xmath14 does not exist for any @xmath17 or there are arbitrarily small values of @xmath17 such that @xmath19 , then we let @xmath20 .",
    "note that @xmath20 implies that @xmath21 while for @xmath21 , @xmath22 may or may not be @xmath23 .",
    "the scattering map @xmath24 takes a vector @xmath7 to the vector @xmath25 .",
    "it will not be defined when @xmath18 and will be @xmath8 itself when @xmath20 .",
    "if another surface @xmath26 has isometric boundary to @xmath3 in the sense that @xmath27 ( @xmath5 restricted to @xmath4 ) is isometric to @xmath28 ( i.e. they have the same number of components - circles - with the same lengths ) , then we can identify @xmath29 with @xmath6 and @xmath30 with @xmath12 .",
    "we say that @xmath3 and @xmath26 have the same scattering data if they have isometric boundaries and under the identifications given by the isometry they have the same scattering map .",
    "if in addition the travel times @xmath22 coincide then they are said to have the same lens data .",
    "a compact manifold @xmath3 is said to be scattering ( resp .",
    "lens ) rigid if for any other manifold @xmath26 with the same scattering ( resp .",
    "lens ) data there is an isometry from @xmath31 to @xmath11 that agrees with the given isometry of the boundaries .    in this paper",
    "we prove three such rigidity results .",

    "[ flatmobius ] the flat mbius strip is lens rigid .",
    "[ negative curvature ] a cylinder with negative curvature and convex boundary is lens rigid .",
    "the higher dimensional version of theorem [ flatcylinder ] was proved recently @xcite by the first author . in that paper",
    "it was shown that for @xmath33 , @xmath34 is scattering rigid where @xmath35 represents the unit disc in @xmath36 .",
    "this was the first example of such a rigidity theorem that had trapped geodesic rays ( however @xcite has a local rigidity result that includes trapped geodesic rays ) .",
    "the two dimensional case has a number of differences from the higher dimensional case .",
    "although it is possible to approach theorem [ flatcylinder ] with methods as in @xcite there are a number of complications . in particular ,",
    "the boundary is neither connected nor does the second fundamental form have a positive eigenvalue . here",
    "we use a different approach entirely , which is very two dimensional and also allows us to prove the other results .",
    "we should note that in the two dimensional case we do not prove scattering rigidity , but only lens rigidity .",
    "we see by example ( see below ) that the flat mbius band is not scattering rigid ( at least if one allows @xmath37 metrics ) while the other two cases are still open .",
    "[ cylinders ]     the fact that not all manifolds are scattering rigid was pointed out in @xcite . for @xmath38",
    "let @xmath39 be a small smooth bump function which is 0 outside @xmath40 and positive in @xmath41 .",
    "for @xmath42 consider surfaces of revolution @xmath43 with smooth generating functions @xmath44 for @xmath45 $ ] .",
    "these surfaces of revolution look like flat cylinders with bumps on them that are shifted depending on @xmath46 but otherwise look the same ( see figure [ cylinders ] ) .",
    "the clairaut relations show that , independent of @xmath46 , geodesics entering one side with a given initial condition exit out the other side after the same distance at the same point with the same angle .",
    "hence all metrics have the same scattering data ( and in fact lens data ) but are not isometric .",
    "a much larger class of examples was given in section 6 of @xcite .",
    "we now present an example that shows that the flat mbius band is not scattering rigid .",
    "let @xmath47 be the cylinder @xmath48\\times s^1 $ ] and let @xmath49 be a hemisphere attached to @xmath47 by identifying the equator with the the curve @xmath50 .",
    "we get @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the identification above .",
    "note that @xmath31 is topologically a disc .",
    "we need to understand some of the geodesics on @xmath31 .",
    "observe that any geodesic in the cylinder that reaches @xmath50 forming an angle @xmath53 with it goes into @xmath49 , where it is a great circle that leaves @xmath49 again at its antipodal point forming the same angle @xmath53 .",
    "from the point of view of the cylinder , any geodesic that leaves it through a point @xmath54 comes back at the point @xmath55 with the same angle .",
    "thus , the scattering data of @xmath31 is the same as that of @xmath56 ; the cylinder with one boundary identified to itself via the antipodal map .",
    "i.e. @xmath56 is a flat mbius band .",
    "therefore , the scattering data of @xmath56 and @xmath31 are the same , but the travel times are different . in fact",
    "they differ by exactly @xmath57 .",
    "[ caps ]     all known examples of nonisometric spaces with the same lens or scattering data have in common that there are trapped geodesics .",
    "the scattering and lens rigidity problems are closely related to other inverse problems .",
    "in particular , the boundary rigidity problem is equivalent to the lens rigidity question in the simple and sgm cases .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite for definitions and relations to some other problems . there is a vast literature on these problems ( see for example @xcite ) . in particular , it was shown in @xcite that simple two dimensional compact manifolds are boundary rigid ( hence lens and scattering rigid ) .",
    "the simple condition however precludes trapped geodesic rays .    the main issue in the proofs of all the theorems in this paper is to show that the space of trapped geodesics has measure @xmath23 .",
    "we will get at this by counting intersections of geodesics and applying a version of crofton s formula .",
    "we do this in section [ intersections ] .",
    "we prove theorems [ flatcylinder ] and theorem [ flatmobius ] in section [ flatcase ] using rigidity arguments developed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "theorem [ negative curvature ] is proved in section [ negativecase ] using a rigidity method developed by otal in @xcite ) .",
    "in this section we discuss how to use a version of crofton s formula to show that trapped geodesics have measure @xmath23 .",
    "we begin with the general case of two @xmath58-dimensional manifolds @xmath11 and @xmath31 with the same boundary and the same scattering data .",
    "the space of geodesics that start at the boundary can be parametrised by their initial vector in @xmath6 . for @xmath59 and @xmath60 $ ]",
    "let @xmath61 be the geodesic starting at @xmath46 that makes an angle @xmath62 with the inward direction .",
    "the liouville measure on the space of geodesics leaving the boundary can be represented as @xmath63 , where @xmath64 represents the arclength along the boundary .",
    "in fact , santal s formula ( see chapter 19 of @xcite ) tells us that this is true for any curve @xmath65 in @xmath11 .",
    "namely , if we parametrise the geodesics passing through @xmath65 by arclength @xmath66 along @xmath65 and angle @xmath67 made with a chosen normal , then the liouville measure will be @xmath68 .",
    "of course @xmath61 might intersect the curve @xmath65 many times ( or not at all ) .",
    "let @xmath69 be the geometric number of times that @xmath61 intersects @xmath65 .",
    "also let @xmath70 be the subset of the unit vectors at @xmath71 that are tangent to geodesics that started at a boundary point .",
    "the above gives us the following version of crofton s formula ( which works in both @xmath11 and @xmath31 ) : @xmath72    we will let @xmath73 ( resp @xmath74 ) be the space of non - trapped geodesics that are not tangent to the boundary at either endpoint .",
    "@xmath73 can be parameterized as an open subset of the unit vectors @xmath6 on the boundary pointing inward .",
    "@xmath74 can be identified with @xmath73 by this parametrization .",
    "we will consider the corresponding intersection functions @xmath75 and @xmath76 which map @xmath77 to the nonnegative integers via the geometric intersection number ( i.e. the number of intersection points ) of the geodesics @xmath78 and @xmath65 ( respectively @xmath79 and @xmath80 ) , where @xmath78 and @xmath65 are distinct non trapped geodesics ( running from boundary point to boundary point ) of @xmath11 and @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the corresponding geodesics in @xmath31 .",
    "we will show that these functions are closely related .",
    "they need not be the same though as the counter example to scattering rigidity for the mbius strip has @xmath81 .",
    "let @xmath78 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 be distinct elements of @xmath73 such that @xmath82 and @xmath83 are in the same component of @xmath73 . then @xmath84    since @xmath73 is an open subset of a @xmath58-dimensional manifold we can ( by standard transversality arguments ) choose a smooth path @xmath85 from @xmath82 to @xmath83 such that @xmath86 and @xmath87 for any @xmath88 $ ] , and @xmath85 intersects transversely the subspace @xmath89 of @xmath73 consisting of geodesics with an endpoint in common with @xmath78 . in particular ,",
    "if an endpoint of @xmath90 ( say @xmath91 ) coincides with an endpoint of @xmath78 , then @xmath92 is not the zero vector .",
    "since geodesics always intersect transversely ( except at boundary points ) @xmath93 ( resp @xmath94 ) only changes for those @xmath95 s when @xmath96 .",
    "as we pass trough @xmath95 @xmath97 and @xmath98 change by exactly 1 ( either plus or minus ) .",
    "however the sign of the change is determined by @xmath99 ( more precisely , the direction on the boundary determined by @xmath99 ) and the inward tangents to @xmath78 and @xmath65 at the common boundary point .",
    "that is , if the inward tangent to @xmath78 lies between @xmath99 and the inward tangent to @xmath90 , then both @xmath100 and @xmath101 increase by one and they will decrease by one otherwise . in either case",
    "we see that @xmath102 is constant",
    ".    we will apply this lemma to our various cases . in the case of the flat mbius strip @xmath73",
    "is connected and hence @xmath103 for some integer @xmath104 . however , there are geodesics @xmath78 and @xmath65 in @xmath11 that do nt intersect at all so @xmath105 .",
    "hence @xmath104 is a nonnegative integer . in the case of the flat torus",
    "@xmath73 has two components , but since one component is gotten from the other by reversing orientations of the geodesics , and since intersection numbers are independent of orientation , we again conclude @xmath103 where as before @xmath104 is a nonnegative integer .",
    "consider the case of a negatively curved cylinder with convex boundary with boundary components @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "it is straightforward to see that ( up to reversing orientations ) there are three components : those geodesic going from @xmath106 to @xmath106 ; those going from @xmath107 to @xmath107 ; and those going from @xmath106 to @xmath107 .",
    "however , for any pair of such components ( including when both are the same component ) we can find a geodesic from each component that do not intersect each other .",
    "the previous argument then tells us that @xmath108 .    our next goal is to study the measure of the set of trapped geodesics . to that end , for a surface @xmath11 with boundary , we let @xmath109 be the set of unit vectors @xmath8 at @xmath110 such that the geodesic ray in the @xmath8 direction never hits the boundary . further we define @xmath111 , @xmath112 ( the trapped directions ) , and @xmath113 ( the totally trapped directions ) .",
    "we say the space of trapped geodesics has measure @xmath23 if the measure of @xmath114 is @xmath23 for all @xmath115 .",
    "[ crofton ] let @xmath11 and @xmath31 be surfaces with the same scattering data and @xmath116 .",
    "assume that the space of trapped geodesics in @xmath11 has measure @xmath23 .",
    "if for every @xmath117 we have @xmath118 then @xmath119 . further if @xmath120 then @xmath121 has measure @xmath23 for almost all @xmath2 .",
    "first note that @xmath122    while crofton s formula says @xmath123 in the above we used that the measures @xmath124 and @xmath125 on @xmath73 are the same . in order for equality to hold not only must @xmath126 and @xmath127 coincide but @xmath121 must have measure @xmath23 for almost all @xmath2 .",
    "in this section we will prove theorems [ flatcylinder ] and [ flatmobius ] .",
    "we will start by considering the cylinder case .",
    "let @xmath128\\times s^1 $ ] be a flat cylinder and suppose @xmath129 is a surface with the same lens data as @xmath11 .",
    "we see that the geodesics that start perpendicular to the boundary ( and hence end perpendicular to the boundary ) all have length @xmath130 and achieve the distance between the boundary components . in particular they are minimizing geodesics , no two intersect and the union covers @xmath31 ( since a shortest path from any interior point of @xmath31 to the boundary will hit the boundary perpendicularly ) . thus there is a natural diffeomorphism @xmath131\\times s^1\\ } \\to m_1 $ ] . along the geodesic @xmath132 of @xmath31 that starts perpendicular to the boundary at @xmath133 the vector field @xmath134 ( where @xmath135 is the unit vector field in the @xmath136 direction )",
    "is a jacobi field perpendicular to @xmath132 . by the above @xmath137",
    "the fact that @xmath31 has the same lens data as @xmath11 says that jacobi fields along @xmath132 correspond to those along @xmath138 in @xmath11 in the sense that , if some jacobi field @xmath139 along @xmath132 has the same initial conditions ( value and covariant derivative ) as a jacobi field @xmath140 along @xmath138 , then they also must have the same final conditions .",
    "this being true for all jacobi fields along @xmath132 is equivalent ( see @xcite ) to @xmath141 but the convexity of @xmath142 tells us that @xmath143 with equality if and only if @xmath144 . and hence we see that @xmath145 with equality holding if and only if @xmath144 , i.e. @xmath31 is isometric to @xmath11 with the isometry being the diffeomorphism @xmath146 described above .",
    "thus we have shown    [ volinequality ] let @xmath11 be a flat cylinder .",
    "then if @xmath31 is a surface with the same lens data then @xmath147 with equality holding if and only if @xmath31 is isometric to @xmath11 .    on the other hand we have shown in the previous section that the set of unit vectors in @xmath31 tangent to trapped geodesic rays has measure 0 .",
    "( this is of course also true of @xmath11 . )",
    "now santal s formula and the invariance of the liuoville measure under the geodesic flow tells us that the liouville volume of the unit tangent bundle of @xmath11 ( resp .",
    "@xmath31 ) is @xmath148 ( respectively @xmath149 ) , where the measures @xmath150 on @xmath6 and @xmath29 are the same .",
    "thus the lens equivalence tells us that the unit tangent bundle of @xmath11 has the same measure as that of @xmath31 and hence the areas are the same ( see chapter 19 of @xcite ) .",
    "thus we conclude the isometry of @xmath11 and @xmath31 , which completes the proof of theorem [ flatcylinder ] .",
    "we now consider the mbius strip case .",
    "we want to do this by passing to the orientation double cover of @xmath11 and @xmath31 and then apply theorem [ flatcylinder ] .",
    "the only real issue in doing this is to see that @xmath31 is not orientable .",
    "( note that in the counterexample to scattering rigidity @xmath31 is orientable . )",
    "the key point to note is that the argument in the previous section says that the geodesics leaving the boundary perpendicularly can not intersect ( or else they would be too long ) .",
    "thus in @xmath31 going across such a geodesic and following the boundary back to the original point reverses orientation ( just as in @xmath11 ) .",
    "thus we can pass to the two fold covers to complete the proof of theorem [ flatmobius ] .",
    "in this section we will prove theorem [ negative curvature ] .",
    "fix a boundary point @xmath151 and its corresponding point @xmath152 .",
    "let @xmath153 be the unit speed parametrization of the boundary component with @xmath154 ( which of course goes around the boundary infinitely often ) .",
    "similarly define @xmath80 .",
    "we let @xmath155 be the geodesic segment ( varying continuously in @xmath2 ) from @xmath115 to @xmath71 .",
    "let @xmath156 be the corresponding geodesic segment in @xmath31 .",
    "our first goal is to show that there are no conjugate points along any geodesic in @xmath31 . by the convexity of the boundary , for @xmath2 near @xmath23",
    "both @xmath155 and @xmath156 are minimizing .",
    "in particular , for small @xmath2 there are no conjugate points along @xmath156 .",
    "if any such geodesic @xmath156 has a conjugate point let @xmath95 be the first @xmath2 ( i.e. @xmath157 is the smallest ) where this happens .",
    "since @xmath156 is a smooth variation , the conjugate pair must be the endpoints .",
    "however , the lens equivalence would imply that the endpoints are also conjugate along @xmath158 , but this ca nt happen by the negative curvature assumption .",
    "this covers all geodesics from this boundary component to itself .",
    "of course a similar argument works for geodesics with both boundary points on the other component .",
    "in fact , since we also know that a minimizing geodesic between components in @xmath11 will correspond to a minimizing geodesic in @xmath31 between the components , we can use a similar continuity argument to see that there are no conjugate points along the geodesics going from one component to the other .",
    "now , since all geodesics leaving the boundary are limits of geodesics that hit the boundary at both endpoints , we see that all geodesics that start at the boundary have no conjugate points .",
    "next we want to compare geodesics in the universal covers @xmath159 and @xmath160 of @xmath11 and @xmath31 .",
    "thus the first step is to show that @xmath31 is also a cylinder , i.e. that @xmath161 and is generated by going once around the boundary curve , which we assume has length @xmath162 . using the homotopy @xmath163}$ ] from the trivial curve",
    ", it follows that the geodesics @xmath164 are homotopic to going around the boundary @xmath104 times .",
    "we also know , by the convexity of the boundary , that every homotopy class is represented by some geodesic loop at @xmath165 .",
    "thus we need only show that none of these loops are trivial in homotopy . however , if such a geodesic loop is contractible , then a standard minimax argument would yield a geodesic loop of index 1 which is precluded by the no conjugate points result .",
    "this allows us to conclude that universal covers @xmath159 and @xmath160 also have the same lens data ( with the boundaries in the universal covers identified by the covering ) .",
    "in particular , it now follows that all geodesics between boundary points ( and hence by taking limits all geodesics with one boundary endpoint ) in @xmath159 and @xmath160 are minimizing .",
    "one can tell whether two geodesics in @xmath159 with disjoint endpoints on the boundary intersect simply by looking at the endpoints .",
    "the endpoints will force the intersection number mod 2 to be either 0 or 1 .",
    "since geodesics can intersect at most once they will intersect if and only if this number is 1 .",
    "but this means that the corresponding pair of geodesics in @xmath160 will intersect if and only if they do in @xmath159 .",
    "we will need control ( locally ) on the covariant derivatives of the gradient of distance functions from boundary points .",
    "fix @xmath166 in the interior of @xmath160 with @xmath167 .",
    "choose @xmath168 where @xmath169 is less than the injectivity radius for points @xmath170 .",
    "then , by compactness , there are uniform upper and lower bounds on the geodesic curvatures of @xmath171 .",
    "this implies that for any @xmath172 the level sets of @xmath173 have uniformly bounded geodesic curvature at points in @xmath174 .",
    "this is true since for each point @xmath175 on the level set and each side of the level set there is a @xmath176 lying on the given side and whose boundary is tangent to the level set at @xmath175 .",
    "( the two @xmath177 s lie on the geodesic from @xmath178 to @xmath175 . )",
    "thus there is a neighborhood of @xmath166 and a number c such that for all @xmath179 we have @xmath180 in @xmath174 .",
    "[ number of trapped directions ] let @xmath11 be a cylinder of negative curvature with convex boundary . if @xmath31 is a surface with the same lens data , then for every @xmath115 we have @xmath181 consists of at most two vectors .",
    "( hence @xmath182 , and @xmath183 consists of at most two vectors while @xmath114 consists of at most 4 vectors . )",
    "fix an interior point @xmath184 . to study the set of vectors tangent to geodesics from @xmath115 and hitting one of the boundary components we can look to the universal cover @xmath160 ( whose boundary we now know has two connected components ) and a point @xmath166 over @xmath115 . for each point @xmath178 on @xmath185",
    "there is a geodesic arc from @xmath166 to @xmath178 ( since the minimizing path is never tangent to the convex boundary ) .",
    "further this geodesic is unique , for if not two geodesics leaving @xmath178 would intersect again - but we have shown this does nt happen .",
    "thus we get a map from @xmath185 to the unit circle at @xmath166 .",
    "the fact that the map is continuous follows from the fact that we have no conjugate points along geodesics that leave the boundary .",
    "thus the unit tangents to geodesics leaving @xmath166 and hitting @xmath185 come in two disjoint open intervals ( one going to each component ) .",
    "thus @xmath181 is the complement in the unit circle of two disjoint closed intervals .",
    "we will first see that the endpoints of these intervals vary continuously .",
    "consider the vectors @xmath186 which are tangent to the geodesic from @xmath166 to @xmath172 .",
    "these vector fields ( as @xmath166 varies ) are continuous and in a neighborhood of @xmath187 have uniformly bounded covariant derivatives by the argument in the paragraph before the lemma .",
    "the endpoints of the intervals will be limits of the @xmath188 as @xmath178 runs off to infinity along an end of the boundary .",
    "the control we have on the derivative tells us that the vector fields @xmath188 will converge to a continuous vector field .    since we know that the lengths are the same as in @xmath11 , lemma [ crofton ]",
    "says that along any geodesic @xmath78 between boundary points and for almost every @xmath2 , @xmath189 has measure @xmath23 and hence consists of two vectors .",
    "thus by continuity this holds for all @xmath2 .",
    "it is straightforward to see that such geodesics cover all of @xmath31 .      with these preliminaries",
    "the rest of the argument closely follows the proofs in @xcite .",
    "the assumption in that paper was that both spaces have negative curvature ( and no boundary ) .",
    "however , the proofs only use this fact on the target space , along with the facts that geodesics intersect at most once in @xmath190 and if geodesics intersect in @xmath160 then corresponding geodesics intersect in @xmath159 , but we have shown these facts above .",
    "we now outline parts of the argument here but see @xcite for more details .",
    "consider the space @xmath191 ( resp @xmath192 ) of geodesics that are not totally trapped ( i.e. trapped in both directions ) in @xmath159 ( resp .",
    "@xmath160 ) with its standard ( liouville ) measure . the scattering data gives a @xmath193 invariant , measure preserving , homeomorphism @xmath194 from @xmath195 to @xmath191 .",
    "let @xmath196 and @xmath197 , denote by @xmath198 a @xmath62 rotation of @xmath8 in the same fiber . if @xmath8 and @xmath198 are not totally trapped , then @xmath199 and @xmath200 are geodesics in @xmath191 that intersect at one point .",
    "let @xmath201 be the angle at which @xmath202 intersects @xmath203 .",
    "we define @xmath204 and @xmath205 .",
    "we can parameterize @xmath208 by its initial vector in @xmath209 , then by continuity of the geodesic flow we can see that the relation between pairs of geodesics in @xmath210 and their intersection angle is continuous , where we consider the intersection of a geodesic with itself to have angle @xmath23 or @xmath57 depending on orientation . since the same is true in @xmath160 , the function @xmath206 will be continuous when restricted to the set where neither @xmath8 nor @xmath198 is a totally trapped direction .",
    "( if a geodesic does nt have an initial point - i.e. is defined for all negative parameter values - and is not trapped , it will have an endpoint on the boundary and we can define @xmath206 by reversing the orientation . )    since @xmath211 is an infinite strip with negative curvature , there is only one totally trapped geodesic @xmath212 in @xmath159 . if @xmath213 is not totally trapped but @xmath214 , we extend @xmath215 to be the angle that @xmath216 makes with @xmath212 . vectors @xmath217 converging to @xmath218 either are in @xmath219 or @xmath220 will have basepoint in @xmath221 at a distance from @xmath222 going to infinity",
