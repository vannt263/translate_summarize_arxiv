    "more fundamentally , combinations of several proposed contributions to the mev cgb may also produce a spectrum in reasonable agreement with observations .",
    "since redshift information is mixed when integrating over sources , this potential degeneracy makes identification of the cgb sources challenging .",
    "we propose new techniques to identify the origin of the mev cgb , based on the observation that angular correlations of the cgb will reveal crucial information on the three - dimensional source distributions .",
    "since snia are associated with galaxies , the snia cgb should follow the galaxy distribution .",
    "other possible mev cgb sources , such as mev blazars  @xcite and cosmic ray shock acceleration  @xcite , have different clustering and redshift distributions , and would lead to different angular correlations in the cgb .",
    "mev blazars , being rare and exhibiting strong variability  @xcite , will lead to uncorrelated angular fluctuations . the contribution from shock acceleration models would peak at low redshift ( in contrast to the snia contribution which follows the star formation rate ) , and would not show features in the energy spectrum . thus cgb angular correlations can be exploited to break degeneracies that are present if only the flux is used .",
    "more importantly , the line emission features of the snia cgb are strongly enhanced in the autocorrelation function , allowing unambiguous identification of the snia contribution to the cgb . furthermore , by cross correlating the cgb with galaxies , important redshift information can be recovered .",
    "the correlated angular fluctuations in the cgb that we consider are intrinsically different from the uncorrelated poisson fluctuations considered by @xcite and @xcite ; that case is appropriate if there are very few sources or detected photons per angular bin , which is not the case here .",

    "we have assumed that the fraction of the cgb contributed by snia is near unity .",
    "if other sources contribute too , the snia fraction can be measured if the characteristic spectral features are seen .",
    "near those features , the snia contribution will dominate , especially in the cgb auto angular correlation , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : flux ] and will be explained in  [ sec : acf ] .",
    "the cgb angular autocorrelation has a different dependence on the snr and provides a new method to measure it .",
    "since snia appear in all galaxy types , we expect the that the snr follows the galaxy distribution with a constant bias @xmath56 after averaging over a sufficient number of galaxies .",
    "additionally , since only snia produce the characteristic spectral features , the redshift averaged bias could be measured in principle .",
    "the angular resolution of the cgb experiments is generally @xmath57 , and at these scales we expect gaussian fluctuations in the cgb .",

    "[ fig : flux ] .",
    "there are only several important @xmath46 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : zcon ] ) , so the inversion is straightforward .",

    ", @xmath6 is mainly sensitive to measuring @xmath79 for @xmath80 .",
    "here we briefly discuss the effects on our results due to variation of the parameters in our model .",
    "as noted , the angular power spectra are insensitive to the normalization of the cgb and hence the sfr , under the assumption that snia are the dominant contribution .",
    "star formation histories weighted more heavily toward low redshift produce larger angular power spectra , due to the growth of galaxy clustering .",
    "a larger delay time @xmath22 causes snia to explode later , and would have a similar effect .",
    "intrinsic variation in @xmath22 would not affect extraction of the snr , but would introduce an additional uncertainty on the inferred sfr .",
    "the feasible redshift bins used in an inversion are unlikely to be narrower than @xmath81 , corresponding to a time interval of @xmath82 gyr , so the error caused by fixing @xmath22 should be negligible .",
    "the number of snia is finite , and so the measured correlations will reflect some poisson noise , which can be subtracted . about @xmath83 snia can be observed and thus the poisson noise is about @xmath84 , which is smaller than the angular correlation signal at degree scales ( fig .",
    "[ fig : flux ] ) .",
    "this estimation assumes equal weights in the poisson noise for snia with different flux and at different @xmath33 . in reality ,",
    "nearby snia should be more heavily weighted , since their bright and rare occurrence will increase the poisson noise . however , they can be subtracted as foreground sources . for a redshift bin centered at @xmath85 and spanning @xmath86 , in a one year survey with one steradian field of view ,",
    "@xmath87 snia can be observed ( the prefractor depends on the snr at corresponding redshift ) , with fractional poisson error @xmath88 .",
    "the volume of a @xmath89 angular bin is @xmath90 , and thus the density fluctuation in this volume is @xmath91 .",
    "then , for the measurement of cgb flux from these angular and redshift bins , the s / n is @xmath92 .",
    "so , only for the most nearby redshift bins with @xmath93 and @xmath94 , does the poisson error exceed the signal . with a proposed gamma - ray telescope such as advanced compton telescope , with sensitivity about @xmath95 , most bright nearby snia within @xmath96 mpc ( @xmath97 )",

    "so , the poisson error is at @xmath98 level . as we will see in  [ sec : observation ] , this is not the dominant error source .",
    "so for the purpose of this paper , we omit the complexity in estimating this poisson noise in more detail .",
    "since the snia cgb is tightly correlated with galaxies , by using the galaxy clustering data as a function of photometric redshift range , the snia redshift distribution can be recovered .",
    "this cross correlation provides a new and robust way to identify cgb sources .",
    "for example , any cgb sources at high redshifts have no correlation with galaxies , which is particularly important for testing some new physics models , discussed further below .",

    "the contribution at a given energy is dominated by at most several redshift bins , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : zcon ] , due to the snia line emission features .",
    "these redshift bins are then optimal for the cross correlation measurement because they contain the strongest signal . with large galaxy surveys ,",
    "in which redshifts are measured spectroscopically or photometrically ( by colors ) , it would be easy to select the best ranges of redshifts for given energies .",
    "in the limit that the line emission features dominate , eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ccf ] ) becomes @xmath105 which also allows a direct measurement of @xmath79 , where @xmath7 is sensitive mainly to @xmath106 because of the increased density fluctuations and more easily observable galaxies at lower redshifts .",
    "the three methods discussed above to recover @xmath79 involve very few assumptions .",
    "the cosmological parameters have been or will be measured precisely , and measurements of galaxy clustering over a broad range of scales are also rapidly improving . the multi - wavelength properties and possible evolution of snia will be calibrated by present and future observations .",
    "thus the feasibility of our proposed methods depends mainly on the cgb observations .",
    "low gamma ray fluxes and low @xmath107 make the measurements of @xmath11 , @xmath7 , and especially @xmath6 highly challenging , but the results would provide new and important tests of @xmath15 . here",
    "we estimate the requirements for such measurements .    in the mev range ,",
    "the main noise sources arise from cosmic rays and radioactivities in the detectors  @xcite ; these can be treated as poisson noise and subtracted .",

    "@xmath111 is the fractional sky coverage , and @xmath112 and @xmath113 are the total numbers of received instrumental events and cgb gammas , respectively . here",
    "we have assumed equal weights for all snia . as discussed in  [ sec : acf ] , this simplification is sufficient for addressing @xmath114 , the most relevant parameter for the uncertainty on the cgb correlations . on the average , each snia contributes less than one detected gamma ray , so the signal poisson noise is determined by @xmath113 instead of the total number of snia in the survey volume and observing period .",
    "the window function @xmath115 reflects the angular resolution of cgb experiment , which we assume to be @xmath116 , where @xmath117 is the angular resolution of the survey .    for fixed survey time",
    "( fixed @xmath112 and @xmath113 ) , the optimal survey strategy has to compromise between a larger @xmath118 , which decreases the cosmic variance , and a smaller @xmath118 , which decreases the noise power spectrum @xmath119 .",
    "thus there exists an optimal sky coverage @xmath120 for each @xmath121 such that the relative error of @xmath6 is the smallest : @xmath122 the uncertainty in the measured @xmath123 is then given by @xmath124 the noise power spectrum of the galaxy survey is @xmath125 , where @xmath126 is the number of galaxies observed with a sky coverage @xmath127 , and @xmath10 is the cross correlation coefficient between the cgb and a galaxy survey . for the cross correlation ,",
    "larger @xmath111 always improves the measurement .",
    "our results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : error ] .",
    "we have adopted sdss as the target galaxy survey .",
    "we found that the optimal angular scale for correlation detections is the degree scale , essentially the smallest scale allowed by the detector angular resolution .",
    "though higher accuracy could be achieved at smaller scales , some of the assumptions about gaussian fluctuations and constant bias may begin to break down . at degree scales , for surveys containing @xmath128 galaxies , the galaxy poisson noise ( the @xmath129 term in eq .",
    "[ eqn : ccferror ] ) is negligible , and @xmath130 .",
    "thus for a shallower survey covering the whole sky and containing the same amount of galaxies as sdss , the accuracy of the measured @xmath7 could be improved by a factor of 2 .",
    "but in order to study high redshift snia with the cross correlation , surveys deeper than sdss are required .",
    "the key requirements for the necessary detections are ( a ) good s / n ( @xmath131 ) , ( b ) large sky coverage ( @xmath132 ) , and ( c ) large number of gamma detections ( @xmath133 ) .",
    "the gamma flux is @xmath134 , so a field of view of @xmath135 and an integration time of @xmath82 year are required .",
    "these requirements guarantee @xmath136 contributing snia per pixel , and will average out the time dependence of the snia gamma ray emission ( bright for @xmath82 year ) and possible dispersion in snia spectra .",

    "additionally , our proposed inversion technique using the mean flux spectrum would probe the snia and sfr rates to even higher redshifts .",
    "a variety of new physics models predict or allow contributions to the present - day mev cgb , for example the decay of non - baryonic cold dark matter  @xcite , the decay of massive gravitons predicted by models of extra dimensions  @xcite , and primordial black hole evaporation  @xcite .",
    "when those photons arise from high - redshift sources , their angular distribution will be very isotropic and their energy spectrum may be featureless , though they may contribute an mev cgb flux comparable to the observations .",
    "however , such sources may be separated from the snia contribution by using the techniques introduced in this paper , allowing more stringent tests of new physics than with the flux constraint alone .",
    "similarly , these techniques can discriminate against exotic gamma ray sources that follow the halo profile of the milky way .",
    "finally , if the origin of the mev cosmic _ gamma ray _",
    "background is indeed type ia supernovae , then this flux should be closely connected to the @xmath142 mev cosmic _ neutrino _ background from type ii , ib , and ic ( core - collapse ) supernovae .",
    "type ia supernovae ( arising from stars less massive than about @xmath143 ) only efficiently produce gamma rays , and core - collapse supernovae ( arising from stars more massive than about @xmath143 ) only efficiently produce neutrinos .",
    "nevertheless , for an assumed initial mass function , the ratio of the gamma ray and neutrino fluxes should be mostly independent of the sfr .",
    "each type ia supernova produces @xmath144 of @xmath2ni , leading to @xmath145 gamma rays .",
    "in contrast , in a core - collapse supernova , the inner @xmath146 core radiates about @xmath147 neutrinos , the dominant energy loss mechanism .",
    "the core - collapse supernova rate is about 10 times larger than the type ia supernova rate , so therefore the supernova neutrino background flux should exceed the supernova gamma ray background flux by @xmath148 .",
    "recently , the experimental limit on the supernova neutrino flux has been greatly improved by @xcite , and is now very near the theoretical predictions  @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xcite have shown that a modification of the super - kamiokande detector would dramatically improve the signal to noise , allowing a clear discovery .",

    "exotic scenarios might predict rather different flux ratios , or might produce gamma rays and neutrinos at high redshift , such that the gamma rays cascade to lower energies by scattering , but the neutrinos simply redshift .",
