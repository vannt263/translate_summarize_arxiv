    "from long time ago , many papers have appeared on the nonperturbative computational technique of quantum systems based on the idea of interpolating actions @xcite .",
    "the technique is called under various names such as variational purterbation , gaussian approximation , linear delta expansion , interpolation method and so on .",
    "all of these methods exploit artificially incorporated parameter @xmath0 which interpolates non - trivial action of interest ( at @xmath4 ) and some solvable one ( at @xmath5 ) .",
    "when @xmath0 is set to unity , the total action becomes independent of the solvable one and the independence is often utilized to obtain non - trivial results by the use of principle of minimum sensitivity @xcite .    in some cases of those approaches",
    ", the introduced parameter @xmath0 can be viewed as the dilation parameter for one of parameters originally included . on the point of view of dilation",
    ", one can use the method in new ways .",
    "for example , in lattice field theories , we can start with the strong coupling expansion which is often valid at a large lattice spacing @xmath6 and then perform the expansion in the dilation parameter @xmath0 after the shift of @xmath7 .",
    "this technique , simply called delta expansion , was proposed and applied to some lattice models and it was shown that the continuum scaling emerges in the strong coupling series @xcite . the non - perturbative mass gap in the continuum limit was then evaluated to good accuracy .",
    "to be self - contained , we first describe the method below .",
    "let a quantity of interest @xmath8 has an expansion : @xmath9 here , @xmath10 denotes the mass square in momentum space rescaled to be dimensionless .",
    "the continuum scaling of @xmath8 is given by the behavior as @xmath11 .",
    "to access the small @xmath10 behavior of @xmath8 , we dilate @xmath12 around the continuum limit by shifting @xmath10 as @xmath13 where @xmath14 .",
    "suppose then @xmath15 in the scaling region .",
    "dilation leads that @xmath16 and as @xmath17 dilated @xmath8 diverges for any fixed @xmath18 as in the manner that @xmath12 diverges as @xmath11 . since the original scaling behavior is thus transferred to the behavior of dilated function in the @xmath17 limit , there is a possibility that the scaling behavior could emerge in dilated large @xmath10 expansion of @xmath8 , even if we have only finite series to order @xmath19 . to put this idea into practice ,",
    "a critical step is to expand @xmath20 in dilation parameter @xmath0 both at large and small @xmath10 in an appropriate manner .",
    "now , @xmath21th order @xmath20 at large @xmath10 reads @xmath22 . in @xcite ,",
    "the expansion in @xmath0 is truncated along with the conventional rule of partial sum , @xmath23 here @xmath24 .",
    "the order of term @xmath25 is assigned as @xmath26 and it is included as long as @xmath27 . note that maximum order of @xmath0 is @xmath28 . on the other hand , at small @xmath10",
    ", we need only the leading term ( [ scaling ] ) giving asymptotic scaling . we expand it in @xmath0 to @xmath29 to keep accordance with the highest power of @xmath0 of ( [ triangle ] ) .",
    "the result then reads @xmath30 setting @xmath4 which means the dilation to infinite amount , the truncated series of @xmath8 at @xmath31 and @xmath32 were compared with each other and ( [ triangle ] ) was found to exhibit the correct `` scaling behavior '' ( [ smallm ] ) at @xmath4 .",
    "we emphasize that , due to dilation , the scaling is observable in a wide region of shifted @xmath10 of order @xmath33 or even larger .    as explicit in ( [ triangle ] ) the series at large @xmath10 has two expansion parameters , @xmath34 and @xmath0 .",
    "if both parameters are small enough , the truncation of ( [ triangle ] ) would be the most reasonable .",
    "however , @xmath0 is always set to @xmath35 eventually .",
    "then , terms of different @xmath36 for fixed @xmath37 , @xmath38 , mix among themselves .",
    "hence at @xmath4 the order assignment loses the basis .",
    "this motivates us to seek for and consider other truncation schemes admitting analytic control . within those schemes , we like to examine convergence properties as the order of expansion increases .",
    "in addition we will point out that when @xmath10 and the order @xmath39 of the expansion in @xmath0 is large enough with @xmath40 kept fixed , large @xmath10 series approaches to the borel transform of the original series ( [ largem ] ) @xcite .",
    "thus , by exploring various possible schemes , we can obtain computational flexibility toward models complex and not fully understood yet . as a demonstration of important role of borel transform limit",
    ", we reinvestigate the continuum limit of the gross - neveu model with wilson fermion .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in the next section , we introduce a class of new truncation schemes which we call `` square '' schemes .",
    "then we formally show that those schemes lead to borel transform in a certain limit . in section 3 , delta expansion in square schemes",
    "is examined in detail by applying the schemes to a simple model , the @xmath3 component anharmonic oscillator in the large @xmath3 limit .",
    "then , we apply borel transform to study the scaling properties and evaluate the mass gap . in section 4 ,",
    "continuum scaling of three models , ordinary anharmonic oscillator which corresponds to @xmath41 case , two dimensional ( 2d ) non - linear @xmath2 and gross - neveu model with wilson fermion are studied at large @xmath3 in the borel transform approach . in the non - linear @xmath2 model , to improve the accuracy of approximating the continuum limit , symanzik s improved action @xcite will be discussed to the first order . in gross - neveu model , we point out that the conventional truncation scheme fails to capture the continuum scaling but the new one works good .",
    "the results of this work is summarized in the last section . in the study of anharmonic oscillators",
    ", we will confine ourselves with the pure anharmonic case where the harmonic mass term is absent from the action .",
    "in this section we define square schemes and study the limit where the order of expansion in @xmath0 is taken to large enough .    to define a square scheme , let @xmath20 be first expanded in @xmath0 to @xmath42 such that @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "at @xmath32 , expanding @xmath45 in @xmath10 and collecting leading terms for each @xmath46 , the result ( [ smallm ] ) with the replacement @xmath47 is derived .",
    "then , we find in the @xmath17 limit @xmath48 where @xmath49 at @xmath31 , we expand @xmath45 in powers of @xmath34 to @xmath50 . then at @xmath31 , the partial sum of dilated @xmath8 is formally written as @xmath51 the order of the truncated double series ( [ square ] ) are labeled by @xmath21 and @xmath39 .",
    "finally we set @xmath4 in ( [ square ] ) . to obtain ( [ square ] ) at @xmath4 from the original @xmath52 series ( [ largem ] ) , we suffice to expand dilated term @xmath53 to the order @xmath39 such that @xmath54",
    ". then , setting @xmath4 , we obtain the simple transformation rule , @xmath55 this gives the dilated @xmath8 at @xmath4 to orders @xmath56 as @xmath57 .",

    "have @xmath10 dependence . as the order of expansion increases , the residual @xmath10 dependence should become weaker .    in 2d non - linear @xmath2 model",

    "now , we consider the limit that the order @xmath39 is taken large enough . in the limit , the factor @xmath69 behaves as @xmath70 hence @xmath71 in original expansion transforms to @xmath72 .",
