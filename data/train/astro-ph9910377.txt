    "planetary nebulae ( pne ) form when low- and intermediate - mass ( @xmath4 m@xmath5 ) stars evolve off the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase to white dwarfs . in this short - lived transition ,",
    "agb stars eject most of their envelope which become thick circumstellar shells .",
    "the central star will later ionize this material and a new pn arises . while the visible pn is dominated by ionized gas , molecular material may still survive in high - density clumps or in the photo - dissociation region ( pdr ) where the optical depth to ionizing photons is high ( tielens 1993 ) .",
    "the presence of residual molecular gas in pne , remnant of the agb envelope , provides us with important hints about the mass - loss history and geometry on and at the end of the agb , and offers some insight into the formation mechanism of pne .",
    "extensive surveys in the co ( 21 ) line in pne ( huggins & healy 1989 ; huggins et al .",
    "1996 , and references therein ) have shown that molecular envelopes are widely observable in pne and constitute a significant component of their masses .",
    "the large format near - ir arrays available nowadays make the observations in the 2 2.122  @xmath6 m emission line ( hereinafter we will refer to this line as 2 , except when explicitly indicated ) a powerful tool for the study of the distribution of molecular gas in pne . since the first detection of this line in the young pn ngc7027 ( treffers et al .",
    "1976 ) , over 60 other pne and proto - pne have been detected in this line ( webster et al .",
    "1988 ; zuckerman & gatley 1988 ; kastner et al .  1994 , 1996 , and references therein ;",
    "hora & latter 1996 ) , and the number of detections is increasing steadily . some doubts about the validity of the 2 emission line as a quantitative probe of the total molecular mass have been posed ( _ e . g. _",
    "dinerstein 1991 ) as this line can be excited either by fluorescence through the absorption of uv photons from the central star in the photo - dissociation front ( black & van dishoeck 1987 ; sternberg & dalgarno 1989 ) or by shocks ( _ e",
    "burton , hollenbach , & tielens 1992 ) .",
    "the comparison between co and 2 emission in pne ( huggins & healy 1989 ; huggins et al .",
    "1996 ) shows that the 2 emission is indeed related to the amount of molecular gas in pne .",
    "the co and 2 observations of pne have revealed that molecular gas is predominantly detected in bipolar pne , although emission is also found among other morphological classes .",
    "bipolar pne have relatively dense equatorial regions which provide a safe haven for molecules due to self- and dust - shielding of uv photons .",
    "they are also associated to high - mass progenitor stars ( peimbert & torres - peimbert 1983 ; zuckerman & gatley 1988 ; corradi & schwarz 1995 ; huggins et al .",
    "1996 ) which presumably have experienced higher mass ejections .",
    "the bipolar pn class is not homogeneous as a whole , as two distinct types of detailed morphologies exist ( manchado et al .",
    "1996 , hereafter m96 ; manchado 1997 ) : ( 1 ) bipolar pne with a compact core or narrow waist ( class b ) ; ( 2 ) bipolar pne with a broad ring structure in the waist ( class br ) . balick ( 1987 ) already noticed this morphological difference ( the so - called early and late butterfly types ) and proposed that b pne evolve into br pne .",
    "webster et al .  ( 1988 ) reported observations of a sample of 11 bipolar pne and noted that br pne have the highest 2 intensity and 2 to flux ratio .",
    "however , their results should be used with caution due to poor spatial resolution ( @xmath7 ) and sampling .",
    "the latter tends to maximize the 2 to flux ratio .",
    "this can be seen in some individual objects , as ngc7027 , whose flux ratio , as given by webster et al . , does not account for the 2 to large ratio variations over the nebula ( cox et al .",
    "1997 ) .    in order to gain more insigth into the correlation between 2 emission and the detailed morphology of bipolar pne",
    ", this paper presents near - ir narrow - band images in the 2 and lines of a sample of 15 bipolar b and br pne selected from the narrow - band images displayed by m96 .",
    "the 2 and fluxes of these pne have been measured and accurate 2 intensities and 2 to flux ratios of each subgroup of bipolar pne have been obtained .",
    "the results are compared with these previously presented by webster et al .",
    "( 1988 ) and the implications on the formation and evolution of bipolar pne are discussed .",
    "moreover , the comparison of the 2 and optical images from the m96 catalog have been used to analyze the relative distribution of ionized and molecular material .",
    "finally , a detailed description of the individual morphology of some peculiar pne in the sample is given .",
    "the nebulae were selected according to the following criteria :    1 .",
    "all the nebulae are bipolar or quadrupolar pne , showing a waist and ( at least ) two bipolar lobes . 2 .",
    "they have dereddened h@xmath8 fluxes in the range @xmath9 , and [ n  ii ] morphologies indicative of the presence of dense low - ionization equatorial regions .",
    "they have angular sizes larger than @xmath10 to resolve them properly , and smaller than @xmath11 to make them fit into the field of view .      near - ir",
    "images of the selected fields were obtained on 24 and 25 june 1996 with the mpi fr astronomie general - purpose infrared camera ( magic ) attached to the f/8 cassegrain focus of the calar alto ( caha ) 2.2 m telescope .",
    "the detector was a rockwell @xmath12 pixel@xmath13 nicmos3 array .",
    "the high resolution imaging mode was used with a pixel scale of @xmath14 pixel@xmath15 , and a field of view of @xmath16 .",
    "the filter parameters are described in table  1 .",
    "different observing strategies were followed for compact and extended sources .",
    "compact sources were observed rastering them to different locations of the detector , so that the image resulting from the combination of different frames before centering can be used as a sky frame . in the case of extended sources , adjacent blank sky regions observed between consecutive on - source exposures were combined to obtain the corresponding sky frame . in both cases ,",
    "the integration time on the object was always 100 sec .",
    "the images presented here are composed of many shorter exposures which were then individually sky - subtracted and flat - fielded before centering and averaging them to produce the final images .",
    "the fwhm of point sources in the final images , which includes both the seeing at @xmath17 m and instrumental effects , are in the range @xmath18 .",
    "the weather was photometric through the whole observing run .",
    "the sensitivity at @xmath19 over the background was found to be @xmath20 .      as opposed to optical emission from pne , strongly dominated by narrow nebular emission lines ,",
    "the situation is very different in the near - ir , where the continuum emission sometimes becomes very important and can even dominate the observed emission .",
    "unfortunately , there were no 2 and continuum filters available at the telescope .",
    "thus , in order to subtract the continuum emission from the narrow - band images , we obtained additional broad - band @xmath21 images .",
    "the subtraction of the continuum emission requires some detailed explanation .",
    "first , we scaled the broad- and narrow - band emission using images of the flux standard star sa1071006 ( casali & hawarden 1992 ) obtained at both filters , assuming that the continuum of this star is roughly constant through the @xmath21-band .",
    "then , for each nebula we subtracted the emission from the 2 and to the continuum image of the nebula . finally , after scaling , we subtracted these non - contaminated by emission lines continuum images to the original 2 and images in order to obtain continuum - subtracted images in these lines .",
    "the 2 and narrow - band continuum - subtracted images for all the pne are presented in figure  1 . for comparison , the [ n  ii ]",
    "optical images from m96 are also presented at the same scale .",
    "the contribution from other emission lines to the flux observed in the @xmath21-band has carefully been considered . besides and",
    "2 2.122 @xmath6 m , the most prominent emission lines in this band are br8 h  i , he  i 2.058 , and a few 2 emission lines at 1.957 , 2.033 , 2.223 and 2.248 @xmath6 m .",
    "after re - scaling the continuum image , the expected contribution from br8 h  i and he  i 2.058 is estimated to be @xmath22 the intensity of , whereas the contribution of the 2 lines is @xmath23 the intensity of the 2 2.122 @xmath6 m line .",
    "similarly , we have analyzed the contribution of the he  i @xmath24 m line to the flux observed in our narrow - band 2 images .",
    "hora , latter , & deutsch ( 1999 ) presented reliable measurements of the intensity of the he  i @xmath24 m and lines for 33 pne .",
    "the average intensity of the he  i @xmath24 m line is @xmath25 the intensity of the line . therefore",
    ", a significant contribution from the he  i @xmath24 m line to our narrow - band 2 images is only expected when is much more intense than 2 . even in these cases ,",
    "the emission in the 2 and he  i lines comes from different regions in the pn , and therefore it is still possible to distinguish between 2 and he  i emission .",
    "the standard star sa1071006 was used for flux calibration . the measured 2 and fluxes",
    "are given in table  2 .",
    "given the inherent high - noise and short - term fluctuations of the near - ir sky background , and the uncertainties above described affecting the continuum subtraction , the measured fluxes can be affected by relative errors which have been estimated to be @xmath26 for fluxes larger than @xmath27 , and @xmath28 for smaller fluxes .",
    "table  2 lists the usual names and approximate galactic coordinates ( the pn g name as described by acker et al .  1992 ) of the objects observed ( columns 1 and 2 ) ; the morphological classification ( column 3 ) ; the angular size of the whole nebula and its ring ( columns 4 , and 5 ) in the optical as given by m96 ; and the dereddened fluxes ( column 6 ) as obtained from acker et al .",
    "table  2 also summarizes the main results of this work : the measured fluxes in the 2 and lines ( columns 7 and 8) ; the 2 to flux ratio ( column 9 ) ; and the 2 surface brightness ratio between the lobes and the ring ( column 10 ) , @xmath29 , defined as @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 is a rough estimate of the peak surface brightness of the lobes and ring , respectively .",
    "emission in the 2 images ( fig .",
    "1 ) was detected above @xmath19 level in all but one ( he 2 - 428 ) of the nebulae in our sample .",
    "the possible contamination due to the he  i 2.1126 @xmath6 m line may become relevant only for the objects with the lowest 2 to ratios : m  1 - 57 , m  1 - 59 , m  2 - 46 , and he  2 - 437 .",
    "in particular , we can not exclude that the emission detected in m  2 - 46 is due to he  i. the detection of 2 emission is confirmed in m  1 - 57 , m  1 - 59 , and he  2 - 437 according to morphological criteria ; the 2 emission is detected in the lobes of those nebulae , where emission is not detected . in the case of he  2 - 437 , where emission is detected in the lobes",
    ", it should be noted that the position angle of the emission in the 2 image differs from that in the image , but it follows the [ n  ii ] emission .",
    "since the 2 fluxes of m  1 - 59 and m  2 - 46 given in table  2 correspond to the whole nebulae , these values should be considered as upper limits ; the 2 fluxes of m  1 - 57 and he  2 - 437 were measured in the lobes , excluding the central part .",
    "therefore , the emission detected in 13 of the bipolar pne in our sample is connected with 2 emission from these nebulae .",
    "figure  2-[_top _ ] shows the dereddened fluxes plotted against the fluxes .",
    "adopting case b recombination , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , the theoretical to flux ratio is expected to be @xmath35 ( osterbrock 1989 ) .",
    "this relation is shown as a dashed straight line in fig .",
    "2-[_top _ ] .",
    "although a correlation between and fluxes is found , most of the objects in our sample fall below the predicted to fluxes ratio ; this is probably due to the poor accuracy of the flux determination , based for most of the objects on a rough extrapolation from flux determination on a small portion of the object ( acker et al .",
    "1991 ) which is likely underestimating the real flux .",
    "the measured 2 fluxes are plotted against the fluxes in fig .",
    "2-[_bottom _ ] .",
    "it is clear that our sample breaks down into two different locations on this diagram . in agreement with the values of the 2 to flux ratios listed in table  2 , we distinguish two well defined subgroups in our sample : those pne whose 2 flux is several times ( @xmath36 ) stronger than the flux , and those in which the emission clearly dominates .",
    "globally considered , the @xmath37 ratios observed span two orders of magnitude .",
    "as we discuss below , these nebulae have different morphological and physical properties .",
    "we can include bv  1 , k  3 - 34 , k  3 - 58 , k  4 - 55 , m  1 - 75 , m  2 - 52 , m  4 - 14 , and m  4 - 17 in this group . in all these cases the emission observed in the 2 line is more than 5 times greater than the emission .",
    "the measured 2 flux is in the range @xmath38 to @xmath39 , with peak intensities @xmath40 .",
    "the morphologies observed in the 2 line ( fig .",
    "1 ) closely resemble those shown in the optical [ n  ii ] lines ( m96 ) . the 2 emission is mainly concentrated in a bright ring , the `` waist '' of the bipolar nebula .",
    "the peak emission of the ring has a surface brightness more than two times brighter than the projected edge of the lobes , as listed in table  2 .",
    "the surface brightness contrast between the ring and lobes is , however , much less extreme than in the optical [ n  ii ] @xmath41 line .",
    "in contrast , the much fainter emission is detected only in the central ring , which appears sharper in the 2 line than in the line .",
    "all of these pne share some common properties .",
    "first , all of them exhibit well defined rings in the light of [ n  ii ] .",
    "indeed , they all are br or `` quadrupolar '' ( q ) with ring pne according to the scheme derived from optical observations proposed by m96 .",
    "note that bv  1 can also be included in this group , although its ring is not so evident , as it is seen edge - on ( kaler , chu , & jacoby 1988 ; josselin et al .",
    "the rings of these pne are characterized by a high surface brightness contrast between the ring itself and its innermost part .",
    "the emission in the [ n  ii ] and 2 lines arises mainly in both cases from the ring , but the center of the ring does not show any emission in these lines or very little .",
    "these pne have also relatively low density ( 100 to 1000 @xmath42 ) ( acker et al .",
    "1992 ) , and the averaged size of their rings is 0.22 pc . in addition ,",
    "their central stars are all faint to be detected in the optical images with the exception of the very faint central star of m  4 - 14 .",
    "in contrast with the pne above cited , the bipolar pne he  2 - 437 , m  1 - 57 , m  1 - 59 , ngc  6881 , and pc  20 are characterized by a small 2 to flux ratio ( f(2)/f()@xmath43 ) .",
    "all of them show emission in the line strongly concentrated in the central , bright core",
    ". 2 emission is detected both at the central regions and along the bipolar lobes in most cases , although the 2 emission is always fainter than the emission .",
    "he  2 - 437 and m  1 - 57 show an unresolved core .",
    "they also exhibit the most extremely low 2 to flux ratios ( @xmath44 ) , whereas for m  1 - 59 , ngc  6881 , and pc  20 , the 2 to flux ratios increase up to @xmath45 .",
    "these latter nebulae , classified as br pne by m96 , have small sized central rings , with a small surface brightness contrast between the innermost part of the ring and its edge in the [ n  ii ] line .",
    "m  1 - 59 , ngc  6881 , and pc  20 , therefore , show intermediate properties between the emission dominated class b pne with unresolved cores ( he  2 - 437 and m  1 - 57 ) and the 2 emission dominated class br pne described above .",
    "the bipolar pne in this subgroup exhibit different properties than the 2 dominated bipolar pne .",
    "their central regions have a high surface brightness , in agreement with their larger densities ( @xmath46 to @xmath47 @xmath42 ) ( acker et al .",
    "their averaged size is only 0.076 pc .",
    "finally , many of the central stars of this subgroup of pne are very bright in the optical images .",
    "* ngc 6881 . *    the [ n  ii ] image of this nebula ( guerrero & manchado 1998 ) shows a highly collimated bipolar structure with a size of @xmath48 .",
    "each lobe ends as a bright knot where the emission in the [ n  ii ] light is enhanced . a second",
    ", brighter pair of inner lobes extends over @xmath49 . finally , a loop - like structure is located @xmath50 towards the southeast extreme of the nebula .    the differences between the [ n  ii ] and 2 images of this nebula are obvious .",
    "unlike observed in the optical , a pair of very opened lobes is being collimated by a marked @xmath51 waist which roughly corresponds to the ring observed in the optical .",
    "the lobes extend @xmath52 to the north - west and @xmath53 to the south - east , almost coinciding with the south - east loop - like structure . as the lobes separate from the central waist",
    ", their width increases to a maximum dimension of @xmath49 . as it is illustrated in figure  3 , the corresponding width of the optical lobes at this position is less than @xmath54 . beyond the limit of the northwest lobe , but at the same position angle ,",
    "extended emission is found as a continuation of this lobe .",
    "the maximum angular distance at which we found emission is @xmath55 , almost twice the angular dimension of the ionized emission .",
    "ngc6881 is also a member of the group of peculiar pne whose 2 morphology does not trace the ionized emission , as it is the case of j900 ( shupe et al .",
    "1995 ) and ngc2440 ( latter et al .  1995 ; latter & hora 1997 ) .",
    "* m 1 - 57 *    2 emission is marginally detected @xmath56 from the centre of the nebula with the same orientation of the @xmath10 sized optical lobes ( m96 ) .",
    "deeper images , both in the [ n  ii ] and 2 lines , are needed to confirm this result .",
    "* he  2 - 428 .",
    "*    this is the only bipolar pne not detected in the 2 line .",
    "it is an intriguing situation , since it belongs to the br class of m96 and it is similar in many aspects to other nebulae in this group , whose 2 flux is a few times stronger than the emission .",
    "however , while emission is detected in he2 - 428 , the nebula is not detected in 2 .",
    "in addition , this is the only case of a nebula in our sample in which a bright central star is found .",
    "since the central stars of nebulae with bright 2 emission in our sample are very faint and difficult to detect , it is urged to investigate in detail the nature of he2 - 428 and its central star .",
    "in order to make a fair comparison of the distribution of the molecular and ionized material in these pne , their [ n  ii ] and h@xmath2+[n   ii ] optical images from m96 were rebinned to the same pixel scale of the near - ir images ( @xmath57  pixel@xmath15 ) .",
    "a gaussian filter was used to degrade the optical images and make the fwhm of point sources in the field similar for both sets of images ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "the contour plot of 2 emission has been overlaid over a gray - scale representation of the [ n  ii ] images in fig .",

    "most of the 2 morphological features closely trace the corresponding [ n  ii ] optical features .",
    "the bright condensations observed in the rings in 2 are also found in the [ n  ii ] images .",
    "furthermore , the optical design of the lobes in [ n  ii ] is also outlined in 2 .",
    "the 2 emission in the bipolar lobes is relatively enhanced compared to the optical [ n  ii ] lines .",
    "the @xmath29 ratios given in table  2 are in the range @xmath58 ; the corresponding ratios in the [ n  ii ] lines are @xmath59 times smaller .",
    "we extracted spatial profiles from the 2 and [ n  ii ] images to quantify the dimensions of the molecular and low - ionization material distributions .",
    "the spatial line profiles , extracted along representative directions of the nebulae , are shown in figure  3 .",
    "they have been used to measure the size of well defined features in both the 2 and [ n  ii ] images . in particular , the size of the rings measured from peak to peak are listed in table  3 .",
    "given the pixel size and the expected fwhm for a point sources , the position is accurate within @xmath60 .",
    "the 2 emission from the ring closely embraces the [ n  ii ] optical emission in the 2 dominated bipolar pne .",
    "differences in size goes from @xmath61 to @xmath62 .",
    "furthermore , emission in the 2 extends further than in the [ n  ii ] line .",
    "when lobes are mapped , they appear to be more prominent in the 2 line ( _ e . g. _ k  4 - 55 , or m  1 - 75 ) , partly due to the enhancement of 2 emission from the lobes described above . a singular case is the 2 emission detected in the lobes of ngc  6881 described in @xmath63 . in this case",
    ", we measured the lobes width at two different slit positions .",
    "now , it would be desirable to transform the angular differences in size to linear sizes .",
    "however , the use of statistical distances is uncertain in these objects , since its particular morphology makes the spherical symmetry assumption on which those methods are based unreasonable ( pottasch 1984 ; maciel 1997 ) .",
    "as there are no individual distance estimates for most of these objects , we have adopted the averaged value among those included in acker et al .",

    "thus , the 2 emission occurs in a narrow region just outside the ionized zone .",
    "we have searched for molecular hydrogen emission in a sample of 15 bipolar pne .",
    "the high detection rate ( @xmath66 ) found in our sample is the result of its bias to bipolar morphologies , since the frequency of detections in a morphologically unbiased sample of pne ( e. g. kastner et al .",
    "1996 ) is rather small , @xmath67 .",

    "the 2 emission closely traces the [ n  ii ] ionized emission in most of the pne in our sample .",
    "this behavior has been reported , although based on mostly ` qualitative ' arguments ( kastner et al .",

    "1988 ) , or the quantitative analysis of a few large pne , as it is the case of the elliptical pn ngc6720 ( zuckerman & gatley 1988 ) .",
    "the improved spatial resolution ( @xmath70 ) of our narrow - band [ n  ii ] and 2 images has enabled us to make a detailed analysis of the relative distribution of the ionized and 2 molecular emission in eight bipolar pne .",
    "the 2 emission is found in a thin shell ( @xmath71 times the optical size ) , just outside the ionized [ n  ii ] zone both in the rings and the walls of the lobes . as pointed out by kastner et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , the 2 emission is brightest toward the ring of the nebula .",
    "moreover , our data reveal that the 2 emission is enhanced in the lobes in comparison to the [ n  ii ] optical emission .",
    "one of the main results derived from this work is that a firm connection can now be established between the detailed nebular morphology of bipolar pne and the 2 intensities and 2/ flux ratios observed .",
    "the pne with br morphology show larger 2 to flux ratios , as well as larger 2 intensities .",
    "in contrast , b pne have the smallest 2 to flux ratios and 2 intensities . this result strengthens the earlier suggestion by webster et al .",
    "( 1988 ) that strong 2 emission is found almost exclusively among br pne .",
    "adding webster et al.s sample to ours , we find that @xmath72 of the br pne surveyed belong to the group with strong 2 intensities .",

    "several hypotheses have been considered , although all of them have their own share of difficulties .",
    "moreover , they do not exclude each other .",
    "_ `` b and br pne are at different evolutionary stages''_. this idea , originally proposed by balick ( 1987 ) , is supported by the different physical properties of b and br pne described in @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the br pne smaller densities and larger sizes suggest larger dynamical ages .",
    "indeed , the high surface brightness of the ring of br pne requires a long time in order to allow the fast wind from the central star to have swept up over the ring the material that once was inside it . to this effect ,",
    "the fact that the central stars of br pne are faint is consistent with an evolved stage .",
    "the 2 to ratio is expected to increase with time for pne from massive progenitors ( natta & hollenbach 1998 ) . according to this model",
    ", the predicted ratios increase from @xmath75 for young pne to @xmath76 for old pne , in reasonable agreement with the observed ratios .",
    "however , bobrowsky & zipoy ( 1989 ) and natta & hollenbach ( 1998 ) models predict a steep decrease of the 2 intensity with time . for massive progenitors ( 0.696 m@xmath77 ) with a high density molecular shell ( @xmath78 @xmath42 ) , natta & hollenbach s model",
    "predicts the decline of the 2 intensity by a factor @xmath79 in the early nebular evolution .",
    "the agreement between the theoretical predictions and the increase of 2 intensity with time is possible if a lower initial density of the molecular envelope ( @xmath80 @xmath42 ) is assumed . in this case , it has been shown ( vicini et al .",
    "1999 ) that the intensity of the 2 2.122 @xmath6 m line does not decline for a pn with core mass 0.7 m@xmath81 as it evolves , but it is enhanced ( the reader is referred to this paper for further details ) . if the detailed bipolar morphology is indeed related to the evolution of bipolar pne , the bulk of observational data presented by webster et al .",
    "( 1988 ) and this paper indicate that low initial densities of the molecular envelopes are the rule rather than the exception in bipolar pne .    _ `` the 2 emission in b and br pne have different prevalent excitation mechanisms''_. note that this does not necessarily exclude the previous evolutionary hypothesis , as the prevalent excitation mechanism may be different as the pn evolves",
    ".    shocks may play a significant role in the excitation of molecular hydrogen in bipolar pne . according to natta & hollenbach ( 1998 ) , the shock contribution to the intensity of the 2 2.122 @xmath6 m line",
    "is expected to be @xmath82 over most of the pn lifetime , where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the mass - loss rate and filling factor of the red giant wind . therefore , for high mass - loss rates and/or non - isotropic red giant winds , shock excitation would dominate the 2 excitation .",
    "indeed , the 2 2.122 @xmath6 m peak intensities predicted by shock models ( draine , roberge , & dalgarno 1983 ; burton et al .  1992 ) for the typical expansion velocities ( @xmath85 ) of bipolar pne ( corradi & schwarz 1995 ) are in agreement with the observed peak intensities in our sample ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "however , no evidence for shock excitation is found in the archetypical br pn ngc2346 .",
    "the prevalent 2 excitation mechanism in this pn has been shown to be uv excitation ( hora et al .  1999 ;",
    "vicini et al .",
    "it can be argued that even with this evidence , the shock excitation can not easily be disregarded , as the presence of fast winds and dissociating shocks are able to produce uv photons in the shocked wind which would indirectly excite the 2 .    on the other hand ,",
    "even if shock excitation is important in bipolar pne , it is not clear why 2 intensity should be enhanced in br pne and not in b pne .",
    "both subsamples of nebulae exhibit the same kinematical properties : the expansion velocity of the lobes of these bipolar pne ranges from 30 to 100 , whereas rings expand more slowly , at @xmath87 ( guerrero & manchado , unpublished data ) .",
    "alternatively , the 2 line intensities may strongly depend on the density of the material and on the shock structure ( shull & hollenbach 1978 ; burton et al .",
    "1992 ) , so that the characteristic geometry of br pne would favor the enhancement of the 2 emission .",
    "an additional excitation mechanism that must be taken into account in the late evolution of the pn is the presence of x - rays from the hot central star .",
    "natta & hollenbach ( 1998 ) , and vicini et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have highlighted the importance of the x - ray heating in enhancing the predicted 2 intensity , specially for pne with low initial densities of the molecular envelope .",
    "however , the uncertainty in the far uv and soft x - ray spectrum of pne forces to use this result with special caveat . no x - ray emission has been detected in bipolar pne up to now , most likely because of the high extinction and low luminosity of the central stars of bipolar pne ( guerrero , chu , & gruendl 1999 ) .",
    "obviously , a detailed spatially - resolved spectroscopic analysis of the 2 emission line spectrum in a large sample of bipolar pne is needed to fully address these issues .",
    "_ `` b and br pne proceed from different evolutionary tracks''_. if br pne follow a different evolutionary track with enhanced mass - loss rates on the agb , they would have much more massive molecular envelopes than b pne .",
    "subsequently , the 2 emission in br pne would be stronger than in b pne .",
    "the evolution from more massive stars than the progenitors of b pne or from a binary system undergoing a common envelope phase may be the cause for the enhanced mass - loss rate in br pne .",
    "the lack of observational evidence to support these particular evolutionary tracks for b and br pne would make it a highly speculative conclusion .",
    "we have presented continuum - subtracted flux - calibrated 2 and images of a sample of 15 bipolar pne .",
    "the high 2 detection rate within this sample strengthens the idea that bipolar pne are molecular rich objects where 2 finds suitable physical conditions for its excitation .    the 2 intensity and 2 to flux ratio",
    "are found to change with the detailed morphology of the bipolar pne ; pne with br morphology exhibit the highest 2 to flux ratios , and 2 absolute fluxes .",
    "although we can not discard the possibility of b and br pne proceeding from different evolutionary tracks , most observational data indicate that the observed correlation reflects the fact that b and br pne are in a different evolutionary stage . in order to explain the enhancement of the 2 intensity with time",
    ", the initial density of the molecular envelope must be low .",
    "the different 2 intensities and 2 to flux ratios observed in each of these two subgroups of bipolar pne may also be connected to different prevalent excitation mechanisms , which can , at the same time , be a consequence of the different evolutionary stage .",
    "the 2 emission from 2-dominated bipolar pne is mainly located in the ring , although fainter 2 emission is also found in the lobes .",
    "the comparison between 2 and [ n  ii ] images of these pne reveals that the 2 emission is distributed in a narrow region just outside the ionized material and that it is more enhanced in the lobes compared to the ionized [ n  ii ] emission .",
    "the 2.2 m telescope at the german - spanish astronomical centre , calar alto , is operated by the max - planck - institut fr astronomie , heidelberg , jointly with the spanish national comission for astronomy .",
