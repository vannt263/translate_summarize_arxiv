    "the high correlation of the structural and kinematic properties of ellipticals suggests that these galaxies formed by similar processes and are largely virialized . assuming structural symmetry , isotropic velocities , @xmath2@xmath3 , a constant mass - to - light ratio ( m / l ) , and structural homology , a tight correlation is expected as a natural result of virialization : @xmath4 where @xmath5 the velocity dispersion within the galaxies , @xmath6 a fiducial radius , and @xmath2@xmath7 the average surface brightness within @xmath8 . in log space",
    "this expression relating basic physical properties collapses to a plane and , hence , is called the fundamental plane of ellipticals ( djorgovski & davis 1987 ; lynden - bell  1988 ; lucey , bower , & ellis 1991 ) . in terms of observables",
    "the fp becomes @xmath9 with @xmath10 , @xmath11 representing the virial plane .",
    "standard units of measure are  for the central velocity dispersion , @xmath12 , arcseconds for the @xmath13law half - light radius , ( effective radius ) , and magnitudes per arcsec@xmath14 for the average surface brightness within that radius , ( effective surface brightness ) .",
    "empirically , ellipticals occupy a narrow range within this three - dimensional parameter space indicating they are a homologous family .",
    "s0 galaxies also lie on the fp due to the fact that , while errors in the estimated  and  are made by fitting @xmath13law profiles to galaxies with disk components , the errors cancel such that the fp quantity , `` @xmath15 '' , is left remarkably unaffected ( saglia  1997 ; scodeggio  1998 ; kelson  1999 ) .",
    "the observed fp , however , is misaligned with the virial prediction .",
    "ellipticals are better described by , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "this tilt of the fp implies the assumptions used in equation  [ eq : fpvirial ] are not quite true .",
    "nonetheless , the uniformity of ellipticals makes these galaxies important standard candles since the observed  provides a direct indication of distance ( dressler 1987 ; dressler  1987 ; lucey & carter 1988 ) .",
    "the small observed scatter about the fp translates to @xmath18 error in the distance to individual galaxies ( jrgensen , franx , & kjrgaard 1996 ; hudson  1997 ; present work ) .",
    "the fp is thus comparable as a distance indicator to the tully - fisher ( tf ) relation applied to spirals ( de  carvalho & djorgovski 1989 ) .",
    "the fp , therefore , should be a powerful tool for measuring relative cluster distances as well as deviations from the hubble flow .",
    "however , surveys of large scale motions using the fp and tf have found significantly different cosmic flows .",
    "for example , the recent fp `` streaming motions of abell clusters '' survey ( smac ) ( hudson  1999 ) reveals a large bulk peculiar motion on the galaxy cluster scale . yet , while smac agrees with the 15 cluster tf survey ( lp10k ) of willick  1999 , most tf surveys have shown little peculiar motion on these scales .",
    "the large and somewhat deeper tf cluster survey of dale  1999a limits the motion to less than @xmath19 , agreeing with tf surveys going back to the aaronson  1986 tf survey . to further confuse the issue , lauer & postman 1994 , using a novel method employing brightest cluster galaxies in 119 clusters , detected a large bulk flow of the `` abell cluster inertial frame '' ( acif ) .",
    "but the direction is in conflict with the results of the aforementioned surveys , none of which have the large sky coverage of the acif survey .",
    "as can be seen from the compilation of previous measurements ( table  [ tab : surveys ] ) , the results of these surveys are clearly discrepant or their errors have been underestimated . indeed , some of the possible sources of systematic errors , as summarized by jacoby  ( 1992 ) , are still not well understood . moreover , as emphasized by strauss  1995 , if flows on this large a scale exist , then they can not be accommodated by any present cosmological model .",
    "these models assume the average random motion of clusters atop the hubble flow is driven by gravity and the underlying mass distribution and thereby provides a constraint on the density parameter , @xmath20(borgani  1997 ; watkins 1997 ; bahcall & fan 1998 ) .    to address this problem",
    ", we examine the fp and rigorously test the assumption that the fp is invariant from cluster to cluster . if this assumption is violated , then previous surveys , which have assumed a uniform fundamental plane , could contain significant systematic errors .",
    "we have compiled a sample of over 400 early - type galaxy in 20 clusters . measured distances to clusters",
    "should be more accurate than to individual galaxies by the root number of galaxies observed per cluster , and thus typical distance errors to individual clusters should be of order @xmath21 .",
    "hence , flows on cluster scales can in principle be accurately determined .",
    "furthermore , this sample allows us to investigate the effects of possible systematic errors on a cluster by cluster basis .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in  2 we briefly describe our data as a thorough presentation will be the subject of a subsequent paper ; we discuss our fp fitting procedure in  3 ; results and statistical analysis are presented in  4 ; we finish with further discussion and implications of our result in  5 ; and summarize our conclusions in  6 .",
    "our observations have yielded useful spectroscopy and photometry of 132 e+s0 galaxies in 8 abell clusters .",
    "spectra have been obtained with the nessie multi fiber instrument on the kpno mayall 4 m , and imaging with a large format ( @xmath22 ) tek ccd on the kpno 0.9 m .",
    "redshifts and central velocity dispersions are measured by matching the galaxy spectra with g and k class stellar templates , using the fourier - quotient technique ( sargent  1977 ; tonry & davis 1979 ) adapted for use in iraf by kriss ( 1992 ) .",
    "aperture corrections are applied to the velocity dispersions , due to the fact that the fibers , which are of fixed diameter , sample larger portions of galaxies at larger distances , systematically lowering measured velocity dispersions . for model ellipticals , jrgensen , franx , & kjrgaard 1995",
    "find the velocity dispersion measured within an aperture varies with aperture size as a power law of index of @xmath23 .",
    "the applied aperture correction to measured velocity dispersions is then calculated using cluster redshift as a first order estimate of distance and the angular  diameter@xmath13distance relation with @xmath24 .",
    "photometry has been corrected for atmospheric extinction , galactic absorption ( burstein & heiles 1984 ) , @xmath25 cosmological dimming , and _ k_-correction .",
    "k_-correction to flux scales as @xmath26 , calculated for an average elliptical galaxy spectrum ( coleman , wu , & weedman 1980 ) through our ccd and the  filter .",
    "we work in  band to help minimize the effects of cluster differences in age and metallicity which can cause shifts in the fp at shorter wavelengths ( guzmn & lucey 1993 ; gregg 1995 ) .",
    "effective radii are calculated by fitting an @xmath13law to isophotes , which have been obtained using the ellipse task in iraf .",
    "a grid of seeing corrections to  and  is calculated from models convolved with the psfs of the images .",
    "merging our data with recently published observations , increases the number of galaxies to 428 in 20 clusters .",
    "table  [ tab : sample ] lists the literature sets as well as abbreviations used hereafter .",
    "velocity dispersions , effective radii , and surface brightnesses have been normalized to the slhs97 system by minimizing residuals of each of these parameters for 56 galaxies in four clusters common to both samples .",
    "the details of our observations and this conversion including seeing and aperture corrections will be described in detail in gibbons , fruchter , & bothun ( 2000c ) .",
    "for some clusters ,  a400 , our sample size is limited because we exclude objects with strong emission lines and evidence of a strong disk component .",
    "we retain only galaxies which are clearly cluster members and which have excellent spectroscopic s / n .",
    "average galaxy fp errors for clusters are comparable between the three data sets except for a400 , whose spectra are of lower quality than the other clusters . however , excluding this cluster from our analysis does not alter our results .",
    "once the corrections described in  2 are applied to the measured @xmath12 s and s , shifts in the fp should be due purely to the change in apparent galaxy size with distance . the  is then fit to all the galaxy data simultaneously by letting cluster distance be a free parameter . specifically , we solve a set of equations with 428 galaxies in 20 clusters , @xmath27 where shifts in the intercepts , @xmath28 , reflect the offsets in log ( ) , which translate into the relative distances between clusters .",
    "because one is seeking high precision in relative distances it may seem most prudent to minimize the residuals about the fp in the direction of the distance dependent parameter , log ( ) .",
    "this particular projection also yields the smallest observed scatter due to the strong correlation between  and . however , lucey , bower , & ellis ( 1991 ) as well as jrgensen , franx , & kjrgaard ( 1996 ) have recognized that minimizing the residuals of log ( ) will introduce a bias into the fit because the errors in log ( ) and  are correlated , since  is a function of  ( see also akritas & bershady 1996 ) .",
    "therefore , like slhs97 , we isolate the velocity dispersion , @xmath12 , as the only parameter with independent errors .",
    "explicitly , we write the fp solely as a function of , @xmath29 and solve for the coefficients , which minimize the absolute residuals , @xmath30 where @xmath31 the number of galaxies per cluster . when the absolute residuals are minimized , galaxies which lie far off the main relation have effectively less weight than they would under least squares . our use of @xmath12 as the independent variable avoids the strong bias caused by the correlated errors in  and  when  is instead treated as the independent variable .",
    "we solve this system of equations allowing 22 free parameters : 20 cluster intercepts , @xmath32 s , plus common @xmath33 and @xmath34 . in this way",
    ", we find the average fundamental plane , , which best fits the entire sample of galaxies , further reducing the influence of anomalous galaxies . to ensure the best solution within a parameter space of such complexity ( 22 dimensions ) requires an efficient searching algorithm .",
    "we adopt simulated annealing , because it efficiently converges towards the global minimum while avoiding becoming trapped in local minima ( metropolis  1953 ; kirkpatrick , gelatt , & vecchi 1983 ; vanderbilt & louie 1984 ) . the convergence is quite rapid and most of the computing time is spent sampling the region near best fit .",
    "the best - fit , @xmath35@xmath36 , @xmath37@xmath38 , is shown in figure  [ fig : fp20]a and is in agreement with that found by hudson  ( 1997 ) .",
    "we estimate the errors on @xmath33 and @xmath34 by fixing @xmath32 , varying @xmath33 and @xmath34 , and constructing maps of chi - square versus @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "our chi - square assumes the average total fp scatter ( intrinsic plus measurement error ) is well represented by the measured average  scatter in  about , .",
    "then @xmath39 ^ 2/ \\langle\\sigma^2\\rangle .\\ ] ] the one sigma errors , corresponding to @xmath40 , are read directly from these curves . for our fit ,",
    "the average  scatter in log[@xmath12 ] , @xmath42 , is equivalent to a @xmath43 error in distance to individual galaxies . assuming the average scatter applies to all clusters , errors in _ cluster _",
    "distances range from about @xmath44 , depending on the number of galaxies fit per cluster .    however , 9 of the 20 clusters , about half the total sample ,",
    "show significantly more scatter than the other 11 ( hereafter  denotes fp  scatter ) .",
    "when these clusters are fit separately , they also fail to define a tight fp .",
    "we must therefore investigate the significance of the larger scatter : , whether or not the high-  fits are truly poor . the degree",
    "to which the  describes the individual clusters can be seen in figure  [ fig : fp20]b . assuming galaxies in a cluster are chosen randomly from a single population , we calculate for each cluster the significance , or probability , @xmath45 , of a chi - square this large about the  and plot this value against .",
    "immediately evident is a break in @xmath45 coincident with a separation in  about .",
    "while the clusters should uniformly fill probability space , a gap this large anywhere in @xmath45 has less than a @xmath46 chance of occurring ( similarly , along the  axis , one would expect the points to be clustered about  rather than showing the deficit that is observed ) .",
    "however , as this estimate of probability relies on the assumption that the fp is gaussian , we have also estimated the probability of this gap by simulating many trial sets of clusters from the total sample of observed galaxies and calculating the distribution of the maximum gap .",
    "doing so again implies the observed situation is improbable , with an expected occurrence of a gap this size of @xmath47 .",
    "this strongly suggests that our sample has not been drawn from a single galaxy distribution .",
    "we therefore refit for  based on the 11 best - fit clusters ( figure  [ fig : fp11]a ) . although the fp coefficients are only slightly different , @xmath48@xmath36 , @xmath49@xmath50 , and   changes by @xmath51 , the 9 clusters with @xmath52 clearly appear to be outliers , falling in the upper @xmath53 tail in probability space ( figure  [ fig : fp11]b )",
    ". if truly deviant , these clusters may not be reliable objects for fp distance work .",
    "but do the high-  clusters distinguish themselves from the rest in any other way ?",
    "pv is a second , independent dimension in which we can examine the behavior of this sample and is after all the quantity we aim to measure .      to derive peculiar velocities , we must first fix the scale between fp relative distances and absolute distances .",
    "that is , we must set the conversion between @xmath54 and cluster redshift .",
    "we begin with the assumption that the clusters are at rest with respect to the hubble flow , i.e. at rest in the cmb frame .",
    "cluster line - of - sight velocities are translated from heliocentric redshifts , as determined from our spectra , to redshifts in the cmb frame using a vector in the direction @xmath55 , @xmath56 in galactic coordinates with a magnitude of 369.5  , ( kogut  1993 ) .",
    "taking into account ( the small ) cosmological corrections , we then find the angular diameter @xmath13 distance zero - point which minimizes the one - dimensional   peculiar velocity , , of the clusters .",
    "this normalization does not change significantly if we minimize  for the eleven best - fit clusters instead of for all twenty .",
    "interestingly , this procedure places the coma cluster nearly at rest , so we would have recovered a similar result had we anchored the physical scale by assuming no peculiar motion for coma ( which has traditionally been done ) .    finally , plotting pv against , we uncover an astonishing result ( figure  [ fig : pv ] ) .",
    "there is an obvious discontinuity in the scatter in cluster pv which occurs across the same region of -space as the gap in probability already discussed .",
    "the clusters which fit  well are at rest with respect to the cmb with reduced @xmath57 while the poor - fit clusters with @xmath52 show large scatter in their pvs , @xmath58 . , and scale inversely with @xmath59 .",
    "estimated pv errors are distance errors added in quadrature with redshift errors . ]",
    "results from both the 20 cluster fp and 11 cluster fp are similar as can be seen in figure  [ fig:20comp11 ] .",
    "while one might naively expect a correlation between  and the measurement error of pv , this is not the case .",
    "if cluster ellipticals do indeed form one population , then the sample mean and sample standard deviation of a randomly drawn subset will be uncorrelated .",
    "therefore , pv should not reflect the value of .",
    "similarly pv _ errors _ do not correlate with ; we therefore scale the errors by .",
    "as we will show in the following section , this null hypothesis is heavily disfavored as the observed non - uniformity in  is highly significant .      to examine the significance of the variation in , we have used two approaches , linear regression and analysis of variance ( anova ) .",
    "simple regression favors a strong correlation between pv and whether we use  to estimate the pv errors ( null hypothesis ) , or use the individual .",
    "straightforward weighted regressions of `` @xmath60pv@xmath60 on '' and ``  on @xmath60pv@xmath60 '' yield slopes which are nonzero with @xmath61 confidence .",
    "the true slope lies somewhere between the forward and inverse regressions .",
    "but because of the two - way errors , it is difficult to decide significance analytically , so the problem can also be dealt with numerically . resampling by complete permutation along the  axis is a measure of the likelihood of the observed correlation .",
    "permutation ignores errors in  and complete mixing of the 20 points without replacement is allowed . under the assumption of no correlation ,",
    "the expected slope is zero , negative and positive slopes being equally likely .",
    "the resultant distribution shows the observed slope to be unlikely , with a probability of less than one percent .",
    "the null hypothesis likewise fails anova tests .",
    "the measured  for the two subsamples of clusters ( defined by the gap in ) are not consistent with a single pv distribution .",
    "the ratio of chi - squares disfavors the two groups being drawn from the same distribution with probability @xmath62 .. specifically for @xmath63 , the d.o.f .",
    "are @xmath64 and @xmath65 for @xmath66 and @xmath67 respectively .",
    "furthermore , the ratio of @xmath68 is no longer purely f - distributed , so we have computed the proper cumulative distribution function . ] again permuting the points along @xmath13space allows us to estimate the probability of the present result without an assumption about the nature of the distribution . using this bootstrapping procedure",
    "one finds the significance for the ratio of observed chi - squares is again above the @xmath69 percentile .",
    "the behavior of the sample both in @xmath13space as well as in pv@xmath13space tends to contradict at very high levels of significance the assumption that we are observing a single population of clusters . taken together",
    ", these statistics are convincing evidence that we are seeing two populations . if this bimodality is an intrinsic property of clusters of galaxies , then all current fp samples potentially mix together these two apparently different populations .",
    "we have established that our sample of clusters divides into two groups defined by significantly different intrinsic scatter about the fp . additionally , we find that these two groups have radically different pv distributions .",
    "the observation that only the high-  clusters show peculiar motions implies that such clusters can inject significant error into the measure of .",
    "this could have the consequence of producing a spuriously large pv signal for the entire sample .",
    "alternatively , these two groups could indeed be subject to truly different kinematics .",
    "either scenario , suggests that the nature of the inferred pv field is sample dependent .",
    "we find , however , no evidence that this apparent separation of the clusters into two populations is due to systematic problems with our data .",
    "there is no correlation of  with cluster distance ( e.g. more distant clusters do not have poorer fits ) .",
    "we see no effect due to data quality or data source ; the clusters which we observed ourselves and the sample which was culled from the literature are equally divided between the two  groups , and with the exception of a400 , the quality of the imaging and spectra of all the clusters are comparable .",
    "we are also confident that our cluster samples are not significantly contaminated by field ellipticals or s0s ; we are sampling the centers of clusters over an area of approximately one half square degree and our redshift criterion is @xmath70z@xmath13z@xmath71 , where @xmath72 cluster velocity dispersion .",
    "we calculate that , with the possible exception of 7s21 , the expected number of field interlopers per cluster in our sample is far less than one .",
    "addition of an mg2 line index term to diminish cluster to cluster differences in the age / metallicity of the stellar populations also does not improve the fits .",
    "we find no strong evidence for curvature along the fp .",
    "in addition , the galaxies in each cluster cover similar ranges in  so that we expect any error introduced by sampling different portions of the fp is at most a minor effect in our final fits and distance measurements .",
    "the high-  clusters do on average have a smaller number of observed members than low-  clusters .",
    "however , we would expect a small sample size to only increase the scatter of  and not bias its value .",
    "bootstrap tests on subsamples of galaxies chosen at random from coma show this to be the case .",
    "rather , the high-  clusters are also on average the least rich clusters , and as we discuss below , there is good reason to believe that  is a function of cluster richness .",
    "if our study is relatively free from systematic errors , then our statistical analysis shows that different clusters have different amounts of intrinsic  scatter about the fp .",
    "but what property of a cluster might be driving this observed difference ?",
    "we have looked at many cluster properties as predictors of whether a cluster will be a high- or low-  cluster and have found only one strong indicator : cluster x - ray luminosity , as can clearly be seen in figure  [ fig : xray ] .",
    "the four brightest x - ray clusters , those with l@xmath73 erg s@xmath74 , all have low .",
    "this result suggests that early - type galaxies within the most massive , well - virialized clusters form a more homogeneous population than cluster ellipticals as a whole .",
    "a weaker , but similar correlation , can be seen with cluster spiral fraction , which is also an indirect indicator of the dynamical evolutionary state of a cluster ( see for example dressler  1997 ) .",
    "clusters with @xmath75 exhibit a spiral fraction of @xmath76 compared to @xmath77 .",
    "this trend of  with spiral fraction is shown in figure  [ fig : sf ] .",
    "similarly ,  appears to be related to the cluster velocity dispersion , which is itself , of course , closely tied to cluster x - ray luminosity ( figure  [ fig : vdisp ] )",
    ". with one exception , clusters with velocity dispersions less than @xmath78 tend to have high  whereas those with dispersions greater than @xmath79 tend to have low .",
    "there are also indications that substructure may be an important component of the increased scatter observed in some clusters .",
    "take the case of the relatively spiral rich , low velocity dispersion clusters a2151 and a400 . in a2151 ,",
    "the early type galaxies in the core have a mean velocity offset of @xmath80 from that of the spirals ( zabludoff  1993 , dale  1999b ; this paper ) .",
    "indeed , a2151 and a2147 are clearly entangled in a mutual interaction ( e.g. bird  1995 ; maccagni  1995 ) , with a component of peculiar velocity reflecting infall and/or merging of subclusters .",
    "a similar offset between mean elliptical and cluster velocity has been observed in a400 by beers  ( 1992 ) .",
    "in addition , both a400 and a2151 contain many examples of interacting / peculiar galaxies ( see bothun & schommer 1982 ) , indicating the prevalence of low velocity dispersion subgroups within the overall structure .",
    "furthermore , substructures that are separated by @xmath81 mpc or less will not be adequately resolved in kinematic distance space by the current relative indicators .",
    "an increase in  can be introduced due to a range in distance along the line of site .",
    "indeed , such a spread in distances has already been proposed for one rich , but high  cluster , a2634 ( see west & bothun 1990 ; scodeggio  1995 ) .    one reason for the fact that highly x - ray luminous clusters do not show significant peculiar velocity may be that x - ray luminosity coincides with the virialization of infalling structures .",
    "whatever the source of the consistent behavior of these clusters , it appears that x - ray luminosity provides a good pre - filter for the selection of clusters to be used in pv studies .",
    "as will be shown in paper ii of this series ( gibbons , fruchter , & bothun 2000b ) , such a pre - filter produces a sample that exhibits no large scale flow .",
    "using high - quality data and a robust fitting technique , we have determined that clusters of galaxies show a large range in quality - of - fit of their member galaxies to the fp .",
    "statistical tests described in  4 argue that the observed separation in  is significant at the @xmath82 level .",
    "additionally , an examination of the distribution of clusters along the pv axis provides further direct support for this separation .",
    "if clusters are truly random realizations of galaxies drawn from a single population , then the total sample should have , on average , a uniform . instead , when the sample is divided on the basis of the observed scatter about the fp , the two subsamples have drastically different properties in the independent dimension provided by the pv .",
    "again , this effect is statistically strong at more than the @xmath83 level .",
    "simply put , high - clusters have large pv and low-  clusters have essentially no pv , within the observational errors . taken together",
    ", these two results can not be reconciled with the idea that these clusters are randomly drawn from a single population .",
    "the behavior of  appears to be an intrinsic cluster property .",
    "we have found that a subset of the clusters , the x - ray luminous clusters , exhibit a well - defined fp .",
    "this suggests that the most massive and virialized clusters possess a homogeneous population of ellipticals and therefore provide the most accurate measures of relative distance .",
    "about half of the cluster sample possess  below the mean .",
    "when using this half of the sample , we find the clusters to be at rest within the cmb frame ( see details in the forthcoming gibbons  2000b ) .",
    "the high-  clusters provide the bulk of the positive pv signal when all the clusters are averaged together .",
    "overall , our results strongly suggest that making a cut on the r.m.s .",
    "scatter about the fp , or more strictly on cluster x - ray luminosity , will lead to a more reliable sample from which bulk flow properties can be established .",
    "the current level of disagreement between various observations of large scale flows ( e.g. table  [ tab : surveys ] ) may possibly reflect the fact that less reliable samples have been used .",
