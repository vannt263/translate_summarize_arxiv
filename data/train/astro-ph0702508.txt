    "the distribution of magnetic field emerging on the solar surface carries clues to the mechanism of the field generation .",
    "one striking feature of this distribution is clustering of active regions which is commonly called ` active longitude ' @xcite .",
    "signatures of possible longitudinal inhomogeneities have also been reported in the distributions of solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field @xcite . furthermore , ` flip - flop ' phenomenon , i.e. the two persistent active longitudes separated by @xmath5 , has also been identified on the sun @xcite .",
    "these observations indicate the involvement of large - scale non - axisymmetric magnetic field in the formation and evolution of the dominant axisymmetric solar activities .",
    "hence , it is valuable to set up the non - axisymmetric dynamo model to explain these non - axisymmetric solar magnetic fields .",
    "the pioneer works on the theoretical investigations of the non - axisymmetric activities can be classed mainly as two kinds .",
    "one is that the generation sources are non - axisymmetric , and the non - axisymmetric magnetic field is produced accordingly .",
    "for example , bigazzi & ruzmaikin ( 2004 ) and moss et al .",
    "( 2002 ) adopted the non - axisymmetric distribution of @xmath3-effect .",
    "the other is based on the axisymmetric sources of generation but to excite the non - axisymmetric field .",
    "the numerical results of chan et al .",
    "( 2004 ) supported this possibility .",
    "earlier studies @xcite concerning the linear non - axisymmetric solar dynamo with decoupled axisymmetric and non - axisymmetric modes have been taken . but these earlier studies could not include the correct distribution of solar differential rotation , which was unknown at that time . recently , there are some works on the non - linear non - axisymmetric dynamo models . moss ( 1999 ) obtained stable solutions which possessed a small non - axisymmetric field component co - existing with a dominant axisymmetric part with the updated solar rotation profile .",
    "bigazzi & ruzmaikin ( 2004 ) studied the generation of non - axisymmetric fields and their coupling with the axisymmetric solar magnetic field .",
    "bassom et al .",
    "( 2005 ) used an asymptotic wkbj method to investigate a linear @xmath0 model with the aim to isolate the basic physical effects leading to the preferable excitation of non - axisymmetric solar and stellar magnetic structure .",
    "however , are there possibilities to work out a linear non - axisymmetric solar dynamo with the updated generation sources to relate with the non - axisymmetric phenomena ? what are the differences , such as configuration and cycle and so on , between the axisymmetric and non - axisymmetric modes ? when will the non - axisymmetric mode be preferred",
    "? these are the main objectives of the paper .    with the axisymmetric sources of generation ,",
    "we develop a new high - precision non - axisymmetric code based on the spectral method and begin with the linear non - axisymmetric mean field dynamo equations .",
    "the axisymmetric mode @xmath1 and the first non - axisymmetric mode @xmath2 are discussed , respectively , in sec.5 and sec.6 .",
    "we will show the difference between the @xmath0 and the @xmath4 models in sec.3 . in sec .",
    "4 , the condition to excite the dominant axisymmetric mode and the condition to favor the non - axisymmetric mode will be discussed .",
    "the starting point of our model is the mean field dynamo equation , governing the evolution of the large - scale magnetic field _ * b * _ in response to the flow field _ * u * _ , the @xmath3-effect and the magnetic diffusivity @xmath6 : @xmath7.\\ ] ] since the turbulent diffusivity is much larger than the molecular diffusivity , we ignore the molecular diffusivity in @xmath6 . for the flow field ,",
    "only the ( differential ) rotation @xmath8 is considered for simplicity . since the magnetic field is divergence - free , we expand @xmath9 in term of two scalar functions _ h _ and _ g _ which represent the poloidal and toroidal potentials , respectively , in the spherical polar coordinates @xmath10 as @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xmath11 when @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , substituting equation(2 ) in equation ( 1 ) , the governing equation reduces to : @xmath15 where @xmath16 @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the terms which have the azimuthal component @xmath19 and @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath18 can be obtained from ( see appendix ) : @xmath22&=&v^{h}_{\\alpha}+v^{g}_{\\alpha n},\\\\ \\emph{\\textbf{r}}\\cdot\\nabla\\times[\\nabla\\times(\\emph{\\textbf{u}}\\times\\emph{\\textbf{b } } ) ] & = & v^{h}_{\\omega}+v^{g}_{\\omega n}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) have been cast in non - dimensional form by expressing all lengths in units of solar radius @xmath23 and time in units of the magnetic diffusion time @xmath24 .",
    "this has led to the appearance of two dimensionless numbers : @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are reference values for the @xmath3-effect and the diffusivity in the convective zone ( cz ) , respectively .",
    "and @xmath28 is the characteristic value of the differential rotation .",
    "the quantities @xmath29 and @xmath30 are dynamo numbers measuring the relative importance of inductive versus diffusive effects . more discussion about @xmath30 will be given in subsection 2.2 .",
    "based on the helioseismic inversion @xcite , there are two strong radial shear regions inside of the sun .",
    "one is in the tachocline and the other locates in sub - photospheric layer . for the sake of simplicity on computational solutions",
    ", we neglect the shear at the sub - surface and regard that the dynamo works in the tachocline .",
    "the following expression for the solar interior rotation is adopted .",

    "the parametric values are set as @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37  nhz , @xmath38 nhz , @xmath39 nhz , @xmath40 nhz .",
    "1 shows the radial distribution of @xmath31 at different latitudes .",
    "it reveals that @xmath8 depends weakly on depth in bulk of cz .",
    "but in the tachocline , the rotation rate changes from almost uniform in the radiative interior to depth dependent in the cz .",
    "within the tachocline , rotation increases with distance from the core at low latitudes , while it decreases at high latitudes . at intermediate latitudes ( near @xmath41 , dashed line in fig .",
    "1 ) rotation is almost independent on the depth .",
    "furthermore , we base our model on the rotating spherical systems with the rotation velocity @xmath42 of the inner core .",

    "however , according to the observations and theoretical computations @xcite , the dipolar mode ( @xmath81 ) for axisymmetric field and the perpendicular dipolar mode ( @xmath82 ) for non - axisymmetric field are definitely identified on the sun although there are some possibilities for some other non - axisymmetric modes exist on the sun @xcite",
    ". hence we will only choose the two modes @xmath81 and @xmath82 as the representatives of axisymmetric and non - axisymmetric modes , respectively and investigate @xmath81 and @xmath82 in detail below .",

    "accordingly we obtain the straight ( solid ) line in fig .",
    "3 with logarithmic abscissa and @xmath92 is about 3840 .",

    "3 , we can see that for the @xmath0 model , dynamo action is increased contrasting with the @xmath4 model by the reduction of the critical @xmath29 when @xmath30 is small ( @xmath93 ) . with the increasing of @xmath30 , the difference for the corresponding critical @xmath29 between the two models decreases .",

    "the field is mainly concentrated around the @xmath41 latitude , where the radial shear is weak ( see fig .",

    "in this paper we have investigated the properties of the axisymmetric and the non - axisymmetric modes with a linear @xmath0 model in a rotating frame trying to understand the active longitudes , flip - flops and other non - axisymmetric phenomena .",
    "the model consists of updated differential rotation , turbulent diffusivity varied with depth and the @xmath3-effect working in the tachocline .",
    "the definite differences between the @xmath4 and @xmath0 models and the conditions to excite the non - axisymmetric modes with the solar - like parameters are presented .",
    "the chebyshev-@xmath63 method is used to numerically solve the problem with a high precision .",
    "we have tested this code with the analytical solutions of a simple @xmath114 model and compared with the results of stix ( 1976 ) .",
    "they matched well with each other .",
    "although the conditions to favor the non - axisymmetric modes have been investigated by some works @xcite , we are the first to apply the updated solar parameters with numerical method to obtain these .",
    "we also point out the role of the turbulent diffusivity @xmath27 during the process . it is poorly known and can not be directly deduced from observations .",
    "when it is lower than @xmath115 and @xmath30 is larger than 4000 accordingly , the @xmath4 model is at the limit of the @xmath0 model .",
    "furthermore , based on the @xmath0 model , when @xmath29 is lower than 3000 , the non - axisymmetric mode @xmath2 will be more and more easily excited than the axisymmetric mode @xmath1 when increasing the value of diffusivity @xmath27 and decreasing the corresponding @xmath30 .",
    "the non - axisymmetric mode @xmath82 has much longer period than the axisymmetric one @xmath81 .",
    "the co - existence of oscillating mode @xmath81 and the nearly steady @xmath82 results in the flip - flop phenomenon . because the differential rotation affects axisymmetric and non - axisymmetric magnetic fields in the different ways , the two kinds of fields prefer to occur in different regions .",
    "the axisymmetric magnetic field is mainly concentrated near the high latitude ( about @xmath116 ) around @xmath113 , where the radial shear of differential rotation is strong .",
    "however , the non - axisymmetric field occurs near the intermediate @xmath41 latitude in the bottom of the tachocline , where the differential rotation is weak and the diffusivity is low .",
    "usoskin et al .",
    "( 2005 ) gave that the ratio between the non - axisymmetric strength and the axisymmetric one is roughly 1:10 by analyzing sunspot group data for the past 120 years .",
    "based on the non - linear models , moss ( 1999 , 2004 ) presented the energy ratios between the two kinds of modes although the values can not match well with the observation . since our model is linear and different modes",
    "are decoupled , it is the limitation to provide the energy ratios between the two modes .    in this work ,",
    "we regard the strong radial shear only exists in the tachocline and omit the sub - surface shear and other details of the distribution of differential rotation .",
    "brandenburg ( 2005 ) argued for the alternative ideas concerning dynamo operating in the bulk of cz , or perhaps even in the sub - surface shear layer .",
    "moreover , we also only take the @xmath3-effect working in the tachocline and ignore the other two possible mechanisms .",
    "the two generation sources are still the hot topics on debate .",
    "since we do not aim to give the detailed description of the sun and just put emphasis on the basic characters of the axisymmetric and non - axisymmetric modes , it is feasible for us to take the two simple generation sources and set up the thin - layer dynamo model .",
    "of course , more rich and realistic models can open new option for the understanding of solar magnetic field .",
    "furthermore , since we tried to expatiate on our objectives with the simple generation sources , the meridional circulation is not considered in the work .",
    "it plays an important role in the axisymmetric mode @xcite .",
    "it carries the strong axisymmetric toroidal field produced at the high latitudes to the low ones and produces the active regions there with the magnetic buoyancy .",
    "but it has no much influence on the non - axisymmetric field according to the work of bigazzi & ruzmaikin ( 2004 ) .    in the forthcoming studies we will include the nonlinearities and the meridional circulation to investigate the influence on the coupling of the different modes and the role of meridional circulation in the non - axisymmetric dynamo .",
