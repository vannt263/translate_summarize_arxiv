    "algebraic @xmath4-theory of @xmath0-manifold groups was considered by waldhausen ( @xcite ) leading to some very general results in algebraic @xmath4-theory which has far wide applications .",
    "namely , the results of waldhausen regarding algebraic @xmath4-theory of generalized free products and @xmath5-extensions .",
    "the motivation for these celebrated results was computing whitehead groups of knots groups and of @xmath0-manifold groups in general .",
    "this led him to prove the very important result that the whitehead group , reduced projective class group and the negative @xmath4-groups all vanish for the fundamental group of any haken @xmath0-manifold .",
    "another outstanding result in this direction is due to farrell and jones .",
    "they proved that the same result is true for the fundamental group of a hyperbolic manifold ( @xcite , @xcite ) and more generally for nonpositively curved manifolds ( @xcite ) ( of any dimension ) .",
    "thurston s geometrization conjecture says that an irreducible aspherical @xmath0-manifold is either seifert fibered , hyperbolic or haken .",
    "plotnick ( @xcite ) proved the vanishing of the above @xmath4-theoretic groups for non - haken seifert fibered spaces .",
    "thus conjecturally this completes the picture for computing low dimensional algebraic @xmath4-theory of aspherical @xmath0-manifold groups . in the setting of assembly map",
    "these @xmath4-theoretic vanishing results are implied by the isomorphism of some assembly map for pseudoisotopy functor .",
    "the more recent fibered isomorphism conjecture ( fic ) of farrell and jones predicts that this isomorphism to hold for all groups ( @xcite ) .",
    "in this paper we are concerned about proving the fic for several classes of @xmath0-manifold groups and @xmath1 groups . at",
    "first we establish a general result showing that the fic is true for a free product if it is true for each free summand . from this result and some standard facts in @xmath0-manifold topology",
    "we deduce that it is enough to consider irreducible @xmath0-manifold groups only .",
    "another aspect of this paper is to show that if the fic is true for groups ( we call such a group a @xmath2-group ) containing a finite index subgroup isomorphic to the fundamental group of compact irreducible @xmath0-manifold with incompressible nonempty boundary so that each boundary component is a surface of genus @xmath3 , then it is true for all @xmath0-manifold groups modulo thurston s geometrization conjecture .",
    "we also prove the fic for a subclass of @xmath2-groups .",
    "we further show that any torsion free @xmath2-group can be obtained by applying generalized free products or @xmath5-extensions ( amalgamated along infinite cyclic subgroup ) on finitely many members of the above subclass .    in this paper by the fic we always mean the fibered isomorphism conjecture of farrell and jones ( @xcite ) corresponding to the stable topological pseudoisotopy functor . in short",
    "it says that computing the pseudoisotopy functor of @xmath6 is equivalent to the computation of the pseudoisotopy functor of @xmath7 where @xmath8 varies over all virtually cyclic subgroups of @xmath9 . in recent times",
    "the fic has been checked for several classes of groups and it has become an important fundamental tool for computing @xmath4-theory of groups ( see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite etc . ) .",
    "in the paper @xcite f. quinn mentioned that the technique we use to prove fic in the pseudoisotopy functor case can also be used in the case of @xmath4-theory developed in @xcite to deduce a similar conclusion for higher @xmath4-theory with arbitrary coefficient ring .",
    "in this section we recall the fibered isomorphism conjecture of farrell and jones made in @xcite . the following formulation of the conjecture is taken from @xcite .",
    "let @xmath10 denotes one of the three functors from the category of topological spaces to the category of spectra : ( a ) the stable topological pseudo - isotopy functor @xmath11 ; ( b ) the algebraic @xmath4-theory functor @xmath12 ; ( c ) and the @xmath13-theory functor @xmath14 .",
    "let @xmath15 be the category of continuous surjective maps .",

    "there is a functor defined by quinn @xcite from @xmath15 to the category of @xmath22-spectra which associates to the map @xmath16 the spectrum @xmath23 with the property that @xmath24 when @xmath2 is a single point . for an explanation of @xmath23 see [ @xcite , section 1.4 ] . also the map @xmath25 induced by the morphism : id@xmath26 ; @xmath27 in the category @xmath15 is called the quinn assembly map .",
    "@xmath28    let @xmath29 be a discrete group and @xmath30 be a @xmath29 space which is universal for the class of all virtually cyclic subgroups of @xmath29 and denote @xmath31 by @xmath32 .",
    "for definition of universal space see [ @xcite , appendix ] .",
    "let @xmath33 be a space on which @xmath29 acts freely and properly discontinuously and @xmath34 be the map induced by the projection onto the second factor of @xmath35 .",
    "the fibered isomorphism conjecture states that the map @xmath36 is a ( weak ) equivalence of spectra .",
    "the equality is induced from the map @xmath37 and using the fact that @xmath10 is homotopy invariant .",
    "let @xmath38 be a connected @xmath39-complex and @xmath40 .",
    "let @xmath33 be the universal cover @xmath41 of @xmath38 and the action of @xmath29 on @xmath33 is the action by group of covering transformation .",
    "if we take an aspherical @xmath39-complex @xmath42 with @xmath43 and @xmath33 is the universal cover @xmath44 of @xmath42 then by [ @xcite , corollary 2.2.1 ] if the fic is true for the space @xmath44 then it is true for @xmath41 also .",
    "thus throughout the paper whenever we say that the fic is true for a discrete group @xmath29 or for the fundamental group @xmath45 of a space @xmath33 we would mean it is true for the eilenberg - maclane space @xmath46 or @xmath47 and the functor @xmath48 .",
