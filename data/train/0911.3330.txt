    "we have studied the incompressibility of an asymmetric nuclear matter at its saturation density .",
    "we find that in its power series expansion in isospin asymmetry the magnitude of the 4th - order @xmath4 parameter is generally small compared to that of the 2nd - order @xmath5 parameter , so the latter essentially characterizes the isospin dependence of the incompressibility of asymmetric nuclear matter at saturation density .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath5 parameter can be uniquely determined by the slope @xmath7 and the curvature @xmath8 of nuclear symmetry energy at normal nuclear matter density and the ratio @xmath10 of the 3rd - order and incompressibility coefficients of symmetric nuclear matter at saturation density , and we find the higher order @xmath9 contribution to @xmath5 generally can not be neglected . since there is no experimental information on the @xmath36 parameter and the @xmath8 parameter , we have thus used the msl model , which can reasonably describe the general properties of symmetric nuclear matter and the symmetry energy predicted by both the mdi model and the shf approach , to estimate the value of @xmath5 .",

    "these correlations have allowed us to extract the values of the @xmath36 parameter and the @xmath8 parameter from the empirical information on @xmath11 , @xmath7 and @xmath131 . in particular , using the empirical constraints of @xmath118 mev , @xmath128 mev , @xmath132 mev @xmath129 mev and a nucleon effective mass @xmath133 in the msl model leads to an estimate of @xmath13 mev .    while the estimated value of @xmath13 mev in the present work has small overlap with the constraint of @xmath134 mev for the symmetry term in a semi - empirical mass formula - like expansion of the incompressibility of finite nuclei obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite from recent measurements of the isotopic dependence of the gmr in even - a sn isotopes , its magnitude is significantly smaller than that of the constrained @xmath70 .",
    "recently , there are several studies @xcite on extracting the value of the @xmath5 parameter based on the idea initiated by blaizot and collaborators that the values of both @xmath11 and @xmath5 should be extracted from the same consistent theoretical model that successfully reproduces the experimental gmr energies of a variety of nuclei .",
    "these studies show that no single model ( interaction ) can simultaneously describe the recent measurements of the isotopic dependence of the gmr in even - a sn isotopes and the gmr data of @xmath135zr and @xmath105pb nuclei , and this makes it difficult to accurately determine the value of @xmath5 from these data .",
    "also , a very recent study @xcite indicates that the effect due to the nuclear superfluidity may also affect the extraction of the @xmath5 parameter from the nuclear gmr . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , these features suggest that the @xmath134  mev obtained in ref . @xcite may suffer from the same ambiguities already encountered in earlier attempts to extract the @xmath11 and @xmath5 of infinite nuclear matter from finite - nuclei extrapolations .",
