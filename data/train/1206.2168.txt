    "an incoming virtual photon is here treated as a @xmath2 pair , with an initial state wavefunction determined by qed . for an incoming proton",
    "we make an ansatz in form of an equilateral triangle of dipoles , but after evolution the result is rather insensitive to the exact form of the initial state .",
    "the nll corrections to bfkl evolution have three major sources @xcite :    _ non - singular terms in the splitting function : _ these terms suppress large @xmath196-values in the individual parton branchings . most of this effect is taken care of by including energy - momentum conservation .",
    "this is effectively taken into account by associating a dipole with transverse size @xmath121 with a transverse momentum @xmath197 , and demanding conservation of the lightcone momentum @xmath34 in every step in the evolution .",

    "_ projectile - target symmetry : _ a parton chain should look the same if generated from the target end as from the projectile end .",

    "@xcite , the scale in the running coupling is taken as the largest transverse momentum in the vertex .",
    "as mentioned above , multiple interactions produce loops of dipole chains corresponding to pomeron loops .",
    "mueller s model includes all loops cut in the particular lorentz frame used for the analysis , but not loops contained within the evolution of the individual projectile and target cascades .",
    "as for dipole scattering the probability for such loops is given by @xmath198 , and therefore formally colour suppressed compared to dipole splitting , which is proportional to @xmath117 .",
    "these loops are therefore related to the probability that two dipoles have the same colour .",
    "two dipoles with the same colour form a quadrupole field .",
    "such a field may be better approximated by two dipoles formed by the closest colour  anticolour charges .",
    "this corresponds to a recoupling of the colour dipole chains .",
    "the process is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : swing ] , and we call it a dipole `` swing '' . with a weight for the swing which favours small dipoles , we obtain an almost frame independent result .",
    "the number of dipoles in the cascade is not reduced , and the saturation effect is a consequence of the smaller interaction probability for the smaller dipoles .",
