    "increasing @xmath15 beyond @xmath86 reverses the period doubling since @xmath87 becomes positive , ie . , the region around @xmath12 of @xmath88 moves up eventually restabilizing the @xmath89th periodic orbit .",

    "the creation of a periodic orbit , its destabilization and restabilization , followed by its destruction constitutes an isolated bifurcation curve ( isola ) .",

    "indeed , similar isola features are well documented in bifurcation diagrams of mmo systems@xcite .",

    "for example , consider periodic orbits of @xmath93 type .",
    "similar arguments as before show that @xmath94 is positive and @xmath95 changes sign from negative to positive , hence forming isola structures .",

    "+ as discussed in the introduction , one important feature of mmo systems is the dominance of the parameter windows of stable periodic orbits of @xmath0 type . using eq.([curvature1 ] ) , we show that the width of the parameter windows of these stable periodic orbits depend critically on the structure of the map as determined by eqs.([condn1 ] ) and ( [ condn2 ] ) .",

    "however , the structure of the map ensures that any periodic orbit with periodicity higher than that of @xmath137 and @xmath179 in the regions @xmath135 and @xmath177 respectively , typically have more number of iterates falling into the neighbourhood @xmath144 of @xmath14 . this structural feature along with the large value of @xmath165 ensures that the other window widths of these periodic orbits are increasingly small . //",
    "one of main motivating factor for the study of a specific type of poincare maps , namely the nma maps , of mmo systems is that these maps constitute the dimensionally reduced form of the continuous time system ; thus these maps are expected to retain all the key features of the mmo systems .",
    "it is well known that a dominant feature of homoclinic bifurcation to an unstable limit cycle ( gavrilov - shilnikov scenario ) @xcite is the existence of isola structure .",
    "this is observed in the region of periodic - chaotic sequences in mmo systems , and even in those cases which show incomplete approach to homoclinicity @xcite .",
    "( see below . ) since the isola structure is preserved at the level of long tailed nma maps , as a part of the study of long tailed maps , we have undertaken to investigate the origin of these isolas by studying the reversal of bifurcation sequences ( within the limited scope of @xmath0 type of orbits ) .",
    "for example , the @xmath0 sequences were shown to be created and subsequently destroyed through a fold bifurcation leading to isola structures . _ hence , in the parameter region where period adding sequences ( of type @xmath0 ) manifest , these isolas are prominent and an isola with larger periodicity is embedded within the isola with a lower periodicity leading to a progressively ordered structure of isolas . _",
    "this feature mimics the ordered structure of the isolas present in certain types of mmo systems .",
    "+ from the point of view of continuous time systems , the reversal of period doubling sequences is a direct consequence of the back - to - back hopf bifurcations in these systems @xcite . for a two parameter dynamical system , a degenerate hopf bifurcation gives rise to back - to - back hopf bifurcations and the existence of the periodic orbits",
    "is confined to this interval in the parameter space . within the region of back - to - back hopf bifurcations ,",
    "any bifurcation wherein periodic orbits are created has to be matched by a reverse bifurcation of the same kind wherein the periodic orbits will be destroyed . in other words , in these continuous flow systems also , the periodic orbits born in a fold bifurcation vanishes in another fold bifurcation creating an isola structure . moreover , the amplitude of the period one orbit arising from the first hopf bifurcation approaching the other hopf bifurcation ( while going from the periodic state to a fixed point ) gets progressively smaller . since the period one orbit is equivalent to a fixed point of the nma map , this feature translates to the condition @xmath192 that has been imposed for the changes in the structure of the map .",
    "a consequence of this condition is that _ the first period doubling occurs due to the changes in the shape of the map in the neighbourhood of period one fixed point , while the rest of the period doubling bifurcations are due to the presence of the critical point .",
    "_ this difference in the cause of the first period doubling bifurcation and higher order bifurcations is reflected in the first feigenbaum exponent being distinctly different from the rest of the pd bifurcations @xcite .",
    "equivalently , a large period two window is seen as a distinct feature of the alternate periodic - chaotic sequences of mmo systems also .",
    "+ we have shown that the increasing sharpness of the map and the consequent long tail nature , as the parameter is tuned , determines the dominance of the @xmath0 periodic states . heuristically , the dominance of the @xmath0 type periodic orbits can be related to the arguments on dissipation in the following manner .",
    "the primary features of the structure of the map relevant to the predominance of period adding sequences is the large eigen value ( in absolute terms ) for the period one fixed point , the long tail structure , and the presence of an intermittency channel . in these class of maps ,",
    "apart from the neighbourhood of the critical point , there exists a large tail region wherein the slope is small . by definition",
    ", these regions are related to high dissipation , since the spread of the iterates in its next iteration is suppressed .",
    "( given an neighbourhood @xmath193 in the tail region , @xmath194 . )",
    "one type of sequence of periodic orbits which include visits to the regions of high dissipation with no visits to the neighbourhood containing @xmath14 are the @xmath0 sequences . _",
    "high dissipation favours periodic orbits , hence the stability of these periodic sequences are enhanced at the expense of the chaotic regions .",
    "_ in the same spirit , the windows of periodic orbits occurring within the chaotic region between any two successive @xmath0 sequences , involving at least one iterate in the neighbourhood of the unstable fixed point and favouring negative dissipation ( local expansion ) have window widths smaller by a factor of @xmath165 . these analytical results for the onset of periodic orbits of the type @xmath191 show that the slope at the point of onset of the periodic orbit , namely @xmath195 is related to the slope of the unstable fixed point @xmath165 , and scales linearly with @xmath196 , where @xmath1 is the number of visits to the neighbourhood of the unstable period one fixed point . _ the relationship between the slopes near the critical point and the fixed point essentially controls the width of such periodic orbits .",
    "it must be emphasised that these scaling relations derived are very different from those usually derived where the widths of the periodic orbits are evaluated as a function of the parameters .",
    "_ again , map - l has been used _ only _ to verify these scaling relations .",
    "the scaling relation suggests that the width of the parameter window is nearly independent of the visits to the left of critical point of the map and only the visits to the neighbourhood of @xmath14 determine the width of these type ( @xmath0 ) of periodic windows . for a map with a sharp maximum and a long tail ,",
    "the eigen value of the unstable fixed point will be large and consequently smaller windows widths for the periodic orbits contained in the chaotic region sandwiched between @xmath115 and @xmath197 .",
    "+ a necessary condition for the occurrence of the reversal of period doubling sequences in unimodal maps have been stated in the form of the first two conditions defined by eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , which are constructed keeping in mind the changes in the structure of the nma maps of the mmo systems .",
    "the correctness of these conditions is validated by the fact that the dominant bifurcation sequences of the long tailed maps and the mmo systems have similar features .",
    "further , the similarity of the bifurcation diagrams obtained from the example map - l ( belonging to the class of long tailed maps ) is similar to the mmo systems and in particular bifurcation sequences from ak model .",
    "since the dissipation involved in the higher dimensional continuous time is related to the separation of time scales operating in the system , a larger separation of time scales implies near one dimensional nature as well as the long tailed structure for the map . since the scaling relations incorporate the essential ingredients of the structure of the map , namely , the property of long tail and the _ strength of the unstable fixed point _ ( @xmath165 ) , the scaling relations derived for the one - d maps can be used as an effective check for the kind of dynamics involved in the higher dimensional systems .",
    "these observations are subject to usual criticism applicable to maps considered as reduced dynamical systems . in higher dimensional systems , it is conceivable that the interaction between several parameters can lead to reversal of period doubling and period adding sequences .",
    "the present work only attempts project the entire complexity into a few constraints .",
    "clearly , these constraints on the maps can be satisfied in variety of combinations of parameters in higher dimensional space .",
    "+ in summary , we have traced the dominance of period adding sequences as a part of complex alternate periodic - chaotic sequences in mmo systems to the long tailed nature of the associated poincare maps . in the process , we have _ partially _ elucidated the origin of the reversal of the bifurcation sequences with specific reference to @xmath0 type of orbits which are the dominant sequences in mmo systems .",
    "_ the results are derived based on some general conditions alone without taking recourse to any particular analytical form of the map _ ; the map - l is used only to numerically confirm the analytical results .",
    "further , the example map - l which satisfies the general constraints mimics the distinctive features of higher dimensional continuous flow mmo systems , namely , the reversal of pd bifurcation sequences and the alternate periodic - chaotic sequences .",
    "the specific feature of the dominance of windows periodic orbits over the chaotic regions in the long tailed maps also captures the equivalent feature for the continuous time mmo systems .",
    "since , many maps of experimental mmo systems exhibit generic features similar to those used here , the scaling relations derived for the onset of the periodic orbits of the form @xmath191 can be taken to serve as a check for the correctness of the analysis .",
    "in particular , in bz systems , while earlier experiments do show the dominance of the period adding sequences @xcite , the existing results are not accurate enough to verify these scaling relations . however , we believe that careful experiments should bear out our results . indeed , we expect that careful experiments on a number of other experimental systems wherein the geometrical shape of the poincare map is similar to fig .",
    "2 @xcite , could be used to validate our results .",
    "another example would be the laser systems where accuracy of control on parameters is generally considerably high .",
    "these results also indicate the ubiquity in the qualitative dynamical features of physical systems from widely differing origin , exhibiting alternate periodic - chaotic sequences .",
    "in this appendix , we provide an example two parameter map which has the following broad typical features observed by the nma maps of mmo systems : a ) non zero origin , b ) a sharp symmetric maximum positioned asymmetrically , and c ) asymptotic long tail to the right of the maximum .",
    "it is a generalisation of the bountis map@xcite given by @xmath198 with @xmath199 and @xmath200 .",

    "the asymptotic tail ensures that the nontrivial dynamics of the map is restricted to the interval @xmath204 $ ] .",

    "an increase in the value of @xmath15 leads to a decrease in the value of @xmath14 . for @xmath215 ,",
    "the unique fixed point @xmath14 is stable for all values of @xmath15 . beyond @xmath216",

    "the number of nested bubbles grows as @xmath217 with @xmath218 .",
    "for @xmath219 , a period three window opens up in the bifurcation diagram separating the period doubling sequences from the reverse period doubling sequences ( fig .",

    "we find that the reversal of the dominant bifurcation sequences occur beyond @xmath221 . at @xmath11 ( @xmath222 )",
