    "time - delayed feedback presents a common mechanism which is found in many biological systems including neuronal systems .",
    "signal transmission time delays in neuronal systems either result from ( i ) chemical processes in the neuronal synapses where neurotransmitters are released and diffusively overcome the synaptic cleft and/or ( ii ) from the finite propagation speed of electrical excitations along the neuronal axon .",
    "time delays stemming from chemical synapses are of the order of a few milliseconds , while the axonal conduction delays in both , delay - coupled neurons and autaptic feedback loops , reach values up to tens of milliseconds @xcite .",

    "synchrony of neurons from small brain regions up to large - scale networks of different cortices comes along with transmission time delays .",
    "theoretical and computational studies on neuronal networks with delay - coupling recently highlighted the occurrence of so - called phase - flip bifurcations @xcite .",

    "interestingly , it has been shown that intrinsic channel noise does not only lead to the generation of spontaneous action potentials @xcite , but as well affects the neuronal dynamics at different levels , namely : ( i ) it can boost the signal quality @xcite , ( ii ) enhance the signal transmission reliability @xcite , ( iii ) cause frequency- and phase - synchronization features @xcite and ( iv ) may result in a frequency stabilization @xcite , to name but a few .",

    "we consider a minimal building block of a neuronal network composed of two coupled neurons . as an archetype model for nerve excitation of the individual neuron , we utilize a stochastic generalization of the common hodgkin - huxley model . the stochastic generalization accounts for intrinsic membranal conductance fluctuations , i.e. channel noise , being caused by random ion channel gating .",
    "moreover , we account for a delay in the coupling which accounts for a finite propagation time of the action potential along the axon .",

    "this kind of coupling then corresponds to so - called gap - junctions which allow the bi - directional transport of ions and small molecules from one neuronal cell into another . unlike the conductance of chemical synapses ,",
    "the conductance of gap - junctions is independent of the presynaptic and postsynaptic membrane potential and can therefore be modelled by the constant coupling parameter @xmath10 .",
    "possible chemical mechanisms occurring at the synaptic cleft are assumed to be instantaneous as the time scale for signal propagation along the neurons axon is much larger than the corresponding one for the transport process in the synaptic cleft .",
