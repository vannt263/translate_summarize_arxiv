    "a recent preliminary measurement of the proton structure function @xmath3@xcite in polarised deep inelastic scattering suggests that the integral form of wandzura - wilczek@xcite relation g_2(x ) = -g_1(x ) + _ x^1",
    "g_1(x ) [ eq:1 ] is consistent with the new data @xmath4 at least for x 0.2 . here",
    "@xmath5 is the structure function already measured with good accuracy from previous experiments@xcite with longitudinally polarised protons . polarising the proton in the transverse direction",
    "gives a measurement of @xmath6 and hence an estimate for @xmath3 can be extracted from both sets of data .    in the operator product expansion ( ope ) analysis of deep inelastic polarised scattering",
    "both twist-2 and twist-3 operators contribute to @xmath3 while only the former contribute to @xmath5 .",
    "if one assumes the twist-3 operator contributions are negligible then the moments of @xmath3 are related to those of @xmath5 and , assuming the mellin transform can be performed in which case the moment relations only may apply@xcite . in what follows we ignore this potential problem . ] , the relation of eq ( ) applies@xcite .",
    "the motivation for ignoring the twist-3 terms follows from the observation@xcite that , in the limit of zero quark mass , all twist-3 operators involve gluons .",
    "thus in the quark model , with massless quarks and where gluons are neglected , one may expect the ww relations to apply because the twist-3 operator matrix elements vanish . in a previous paper@xcite ( jrr ) we showed that a consistent covariant formulation of the quark parton model , in which the massless on - shell quarks have a non - zero transverse momentum @xmath7 , leads to precisely the ww relation eq([eq:1 ] ) .",
    "however this formulation has been questioned @xcite because it is apparently in contradiction with other formulations of the parton model .",
    "because of this and motivated also by the encouraging results of the preliminary slac data@xcite which lends some support to the quark model approximation , we reconsider the determination of the polarised structure functions in the quark model approximation i.e. neglecting the gluonic component of the nucleon but allowing for valence and sea quarks .",
    "the connection with the ope is discussed in detail and we show that the assumption of negligible gluon component in the contributing operators is equivalent to a covariant parton model description of the process in which the quarks , which may be massive , are allowed to have a completely general transverse momentum distribution .",
    "we find the covariant quark parton model provides an entirely consistent picture of polarised scattering in which the form of @xmath3 is fully determined once @xmath5 is measured .",
    "the origin of previous contradictions between quark model relations is shown to be due to incorrect treatment of the equations of motion in the associated ope .",
    "we go on to consider the inclusion of quark masses in the parton model . in this case",
    "the parton polarisation vector picks up a component in addition to the longitudinal one and the ww relation is no longer satisfied .",
    "there is an additional polarised parton density associated with this component and restoring a connection between @xmath5 and @xmath3 rests upon relating the parton densities associated with the two components . by considering plausible models for the source of the parton polarisation",
    ", we show how such a relation can be made , leading once again to a prediction of @xmath3 in terms of the measured @xmath5 .",
    "we start with a brief review of the covariant parton model formulation of polarised scattering ( in the massless limit ) which we shall show is equivalent to the ope in the quark model approximation .",
    "the anti - symmetric hadronic tensor is written in terms of the two spin dependent structure functions @xmath5 and @xmath3 , w^a _ ( q , p , s ) = i _ [ eq:2 ] where @xmath8 are the mass , momentum and polarisation vector of the proton ; @xmath9 is the momentum of the virtual photon and @xmath10 .",
    "the covariant parton model expresses @xmath11 in terms of a convolution over the struck parton s momentum .",
    "w^(a ) _ ( q , p , s ) = _ h d^4k f_h ( p , k , s ) w^a _ ( q , k ) [ eq:3 ] here @xmath12 are the parton s momentum , mass and ( in the massless limit ) helicity ( @xmath13 ) and w^a _ = ihm _ q^s^[eq:4 ] where @xmath14 is the parton spin vector which as @xmath15 gives @xmath16",
    ". summing over parton helicities thus gives the combination of parton densities @xmath17 and since we insist on covariance , this can be written as @xmath18 . as this combination has to be linear in the proton polarisation @xmath19 ( spacelike ) , covariance demands that @xmath20 and so we can write f(p.k , k.s , k^2 ) = - ( p.k , k^2 ) [ eq:5 ] substituting into eq([eq:3 ] ) , comparing with eq([eq:2 ] ) and using @xmath21 = ( \\pi m/4 \\nu ) dk^2 dy$ ] where @xmath22 gives ( for details see jrr ) g_1(x ) = ^1_x dy ( 2x - y ) h(y ) [ eq:6 ] g_2(x)= ^1_x dy ( 2y-3x ) h(y ) [ eq:7 ] where @xmath23 .",
    "crucial to deriving expressions ( [ eq:6],[eq:7 ] ) and to the consistency of the parton model is the retention of the parton transverse momentum @xmath7 .",
    "in fact , from ( [ eq:6],[eq:7 ] ) we see that the combination @xmath24 ( which is the relevant quantity for a transversely polarised proton ) is proportional to @xmath25 which is simply @xmath26 .",
    "there is just _",
    "one _ function @xmath27 ( the relevant charge weighted combination of parton distributions ) which determines both @xmath5 and @xmath3 which is the key to obtaining a simple relation between the two .",
    "differentiating the sum @xmath28 given by ( [ eq:6],[eq:7 ] ) gives the relation eq([eq:1 ] ) .",
    "this can be alternatively expressed in terms of moments @xcite ^1_0 dx x^n-1 = 0 [ eq:8 ] the burkhardt - cottingham@xcite(bc ) sum rule being the @xmath29 version ^1_0 dx g_2(x ) = 0 [ eq:9 ]    in section 4 , we shall consider the corrections arising from allowing the quarks to have a non - zero mass .",
    "these corrections lead to a violation of the ww sum rules eq([eq:8 ] ) but making plausible assumptions for the origin of the parton polarisation , @xmath3 can still be related to @xmath5 .",
    "the bc sum rule eq([eq:9 ] ) is preserved exactly however . for a particular model",
    "the magnitude of the violation of the ww sum rules can provide a possible phenomenological estimate for the light quark mass .",
    "at a more formal level the polarised deep inelastic scattering may be analysed using the ope .",
    "of course any viable model must be consistent with the ope and here we show that the covariant parton model is equivalent to the ope approach in the assumption of neglecting the gluon component of the nucleon .",

    "in addition there is a flavour singlet operator corresponding to the replacement of @xmath35 by the unit operator together with a flavour singlet operator involving gluon fields only that we do not give here .",
    "the twist-3 operators are given by o_3,k^_1 ...",
    "_n= i^ns a|(0)^^5 d^_1 ... d^_n _ k(0)-(traces ) eq : o3 where s denotes symmeterisation of the @xmath36 indices and a anti - symmeterisation of the @xmath37 indices .",
    "these operators have a ( suppressed ) renormalisation scale ( @xmath38 ) dependence .",
    "the operator matrix elements are given by = s_1(s_p__1 ... p__n - traces ) = s a(s_p__1 ... p__n - traces ) using this in eq([eq : sd ] ) gives _ 0 ^ 1dx x^n g_1(x , q^2)=a_n , n=0,2,4 ...",

    "thus one obtains the ww relations eq([eq:8 ] ) for @xmath3 . here",
    "we wish to demonstrate that these relations follow in the quark model simply by analysing the implications of the ope under the assumption of negligible gluon content of the nucleon .",
    "of course there is no guarantee that this assumption is realistic but it is of interest to determine its phenomenological implications so that experiment may determine whether a pure quark model picture ever makes sense .",
    "further , having a quark parton model ( albeit equivalent to the ope ) is useful in guiding one s intuition when discussing the long - distance effects as we discuss below .",
    "one thing to note is that , due to qcd corrections , the pure quark model approximation can make sense only for one value of @xmath40 because the qcd corrections that give perturbatively reliable information about the evolution in @xmath40 require that the gluonic component must become significant at high @xmath40 even if the quark picture is adequate at low @xmath40 .",
    "however if the pure quark model is a good approximation at one scale then one may conclude that the leading twist operators dominate at all higher scales , the gluonic component generated during evolution being entirely leading twist in this case .    given this motivation",
    "we now consider the form of the quark ( and anti - quark ) operator matrix elements corresponding to fig.1a .",
    "the contributing operators in this approximation are simply determined using the quark model to determine the coefficients @xmath41 of eq([eq : sd ] ) . using this ,",
    "the sum over operators with the operator matrix elements determined in the approximation of neglecting gluons is equivalent to evaluating the diagram in fig.1b .",
    "the latter requires knowlege of the distribution @xmath42 of quarks with polarisation @xmath43 within a proton . in the next section",
    "we will specify these polarisation states precisely but here we wish to continue our discussion within the framework of the ope .",
    "the quark distributions @xmath44 in fact provide a convenient summary of the effects of the operator matrix elements and provide the easiest way of determining the implications of the valence approximation for the general ope .",
    "let us note the following facts concerning the ope :    operators related by equations of motion are not independent .",
    "in fact shuryak and vainstein@xcite used the equations of motion to show that , in the absence of quark masses , the twist-3 operators introduced above are equivalent to operators involving gluons only . their general result ( for massless quarks )",
    "is o_3,k&= & s [ _",

    "l=0^n-3i^n-3 |d__1 ... d__l ( d__l+1g__l+2)d__l+3 ... d__n-1__n_k ] eq : sy where @xmath45 .",
    "thus the twist-3 operator matrix elements will vanish in the valence quark approximation up to mass effects .",
    "we shall discuss the massive case shortly ; in any case we may use the equations of motion to set @xmath46 , the quark mass squared .",
    "the second point is that the normalisation scale dependence of the operators is cancelled in the prediction for a physical quantity by the scale dependence of the coefficient functions @xmath41 .",
    "thus the evaluation of fig.1b which corresponds to the full observable cross section has no scale dependence .    putting these points together we see that the quark distributions in fact are functions of just two variables",
    "@xmath47 since @xmath48 and @xmath49 are given by the nucleon mass squared and the quark mass squared respectively and , in the relativistic quark limit , @xmath50 .",
    "let us discuss the implications for cases of increasing complexity .",
    "first consider the trivial case of scattering off a free on - shell quark moving collinearly with the target .",
    "in this case the quark distribution @xmath51 is known ( trivial ) and the scattering amplitude is simply given by the @xmath52 born diagram .",
    "some care must be exercised in the massless limit . since @xmath3 is to be determined via eq([eq:2 ] ) ( in this case @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the _ quark _ momentum and spin ) we must use a massive quark with mass @xmath55 otherwise the factor multiplying @xmath56 vanishes .",
    "the massless quark limit is then easily obtained by taking the limit @xmath57 .",
    "the born diagram gives an amplitude proportional to im_q^s^((k+q)^2 ) comparison with eq([eq:2 ] ) immediately shows that @xmath0 .",
    "how does this relate to the ope analysis ?",
    "the operators contributing simply correspond to those in the structure | _",
    "( p + q + m ) _ eq : st the term @xmath58 when combined with the factors found expanding @xmath59 and fourier transforming to change the @xmath60 to a derivative acting on the quark field , immediately leads to the combination of operators @xmath61 .",
    "the reason this combination arises is simply because there is no symmeterisation ( or antisymmeterisation ) in the born term between the @xmath62 index and the indices associated with the @xmath63 terms . as discussed above @xmath64 alone",
    "gives rise to the ww relations and non - vanishing @xmath3 .",
    "thus the vanishing of @xmath3 must come about through a cancellation of the contributions of @xmath64 and @xmath65 . at first sight",
    "this seems impossible because of the shuryak vainstein relation eq(15 ) which suggests @xmath65 vanishes in the absence of gluons .",
    "however here this is not true as a careful computation of the mass effects reveals . to illustrate the point consider the simplest operators o_2= i^2s_1| _ _ 5 _ _ 1 _ _ 2 o_3= i^2sa| _ _ 5 _ _ 1 _ _ 2 by writing @xmath66 we may re - express these as o_2=i^2s_1|___1_5 _ _ 2o_3=imsa|__5__1 _ _",
    "2we now take matrix elements of these operators between on - shell partons with polarisation vector @xmath67 . in momentum space",
    "we have    & & tr((p+m)(1+_5s ) _ _",
    "5p _ _ 1)p__2&=&4m(s_p__1+s__1p_)p__2 & & tr((p+m)(1+_5s ) _ _ 5 _ _ 1)p__2&=&4m(s_p__1-s__1p_)p__2 thus we see explicitly that for the combination @xmath68 there is a cancellation between @xmath64 and @xmath65 of the term @xmath69 which is associated with @xmath3 .",
    "this cancellation persists in the massless limit .",
    "the reason is that although the @xmath65 ( and @xmath64 ) matrix element is formally of @xmath70 this is cancelled by the @xmath71 behaviour of the polarisation vector @xmath72 .",
    "thus @xmath65 _ does _ contribute even in the limit gluons are ignored .",
    "we have somewhat belaboured our discussion of this very simple model because this point has been the source of considerable confusion in the literature .",
    "so far our discussion has shown that @xmath3 vanishes in the free quark model , a well known result .",
    "of course a model of free collinear quarks is not realistic and to determine the implications of more reasonable models we consider now the case of fig.1b with nontrivial @xmath51 .",
    "as we have stressed the calculation of the full diagram is completely equivalent to the use of the ope with operator matrix elements determined in the valence approximation . following the analysis presented above the result",
    "is given in eqs.([eq:6 ] ) and ( [ eq:7 ] ) and satisfies the ww relation .",
    "to understand the origin of this relation we note that the intermediate ( vertical ) states of fig.1b are on - shell quarks and the result of eqs .",
    "( ) and ( ) was derived to leading order only in the quark masses . to this order",
    "the quark polarisation vector is @xmath73 and the matrix element of @xmath65 between the quark states vanishes simply because one can not form an antisymmetric tensor from @xmath74 alone .",
    "this immediately implies that only @xmath64 contributes giving rise to the ww relation .",
    "this result again is puzzling because there is no obvious limit in which the free quark result with vanishing @xmath3 can be obtained i.e. why does nt this argument apply too in the free quark case discussed above ?",
    "the answer is that the determination of @xmath3 requires the identification of the coefficient of the second tensor in eq ( ) . as we noted above this vanishes identically in the free quark limit ( the approximation that @xmath75 ) and for this reason we had to compute @xmath3 in the massive quark case and take the massless limit only at the very end . in the present case",
    "however the tensor structure of eq ( ) refers to the real nucleon and therefore does nt vanish when using the approximation @xmath76 .",
    "thus the argument showing the vanishing of the @xmath65 contribution applies in this case and we do indeed get the ww relation . of course in the limit the nucleon mass is taken small and the _ nucleon _ polarisation satisfies @xmath77 the argument that @xmath65 vanishes fails and the ww relation would not apply .",
    "this is the limit that establishes the connection with the free quark model result for it leads to @xmath0 again .",
    "thus we may see the ww result applies in the limit @xmath78 and @xmath79 are small while the free quark model result applies when @xmath80 , with @xmath79 small . in the next section",
    "we extend the calculation to include mass effects to approach the region where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are not negligible .    before leaving the ope analysis",
    "we should comment on the role of another twist-3 operator not included in the above analysis .",
    "this is the operator o_m = m s a|____1 ... __nfrom eq ( ) we see this operator arises through the term proportional to @xmath55 .",
    "however it is easy to check in the free quark model case that it gives rise to a gauge variant term which is cancelled by the term proportional to @xmath81 in eq()which involves the operators @xmath82 and which have a matrix element proportional to @xmath55 .",
    "our analysis of the ope in the approximation of ignoring gluons has shown that it is equivalent to a covariant formulation of the quark parton model .",
    "as discussed in @xcite this leads to a completely consistent description of both polarised and unpolarised scattering .",
    "the analysis also shows why other parton model formulations have led to contradictory results because the ope requires the use of equations of motion to relate the various operators .",
    "this is in conflict with a parton model formulation in which the parton momentum is a fraction , @xmath83 , of the nucleon momentum because the parton mass will then be @xmath84 , an @xmath83 dependent quantity not consistent with the equations of motion of the underlying quark states .",
    "thus in these models contradictory results for polarised scattering are obtained ( see @xcite for a discussion of these results ) but being in conflict with the ope their predictions should be ignored . as a result",
    "we see that there is no remaining theoretical conflict for the case of the covariant quark parton model description of polarised scattering . whether it provides",
    "a good phenomenological description of polarised scattering is a question for experiment .",
    "only for massless quarks is the parton polarisation vector @xmath14 proportional to @xmath85 . in the @xmath86 case",
    "the partons will , in general , have three polarisation components .",
    "let us choose as a convenient basis the vectors @xmath87 given by n_1^&= & [ ( p.k)k^- m^2p^ ] n_2^&= & ^k_s_p_n_3^&= & ^k__k^s^p^p _ & = & [ m^2(k.s)k^+n_1 ^ 2 s^-(p.k)(k.s)p^ ] [ eq : nidef ] where n_1 & = & [ ( p.k)^2 - m^2m^2]^1 2 n_2 & = & -[(p.k)^2 -m^2(k.s)^2 - m^2m^2]^1 2 [ eq : n12 ]    in the parton rest - frame these vectors form a set of orthogonal unit 3-vectors and , in any frame , satisy @xmath88 , @xmath89 . in the proton rest - frame ( prf ) , they are given by n_1=(|k|,k_0 ) , _ 2 = ( ) , _ 3 = [ ( ) ] [ eq : niprf ] where @xmath90 and @xmath91 are unit vectors in the direction of the parton momentum and proton spin respectively .",
    "the charge weighted combination of the relevant parton distributions in each direction we call @xmath92 .",
    "the vector @xmath93 is the longitudinal polarisation vector of the parton , @xmath94 and so @xmath95 is to be associated with the @xmath96 of eq([eq:5 ] ) .",
    "these @xmath97 corrections modify the integrand of eq([eq:6 ] ) and since the value of @xmath98 $ ] the integrand of eq([eq:7 ] ) is also appropriately modified .",
    "in addition , there are @xmath97 corrections to the limits of the integration in @xmath99 .",
    "if we write @xmath100 then @xmath101 follows from constraining @xmath102 leads to only minor changes since then @xmath103 while @xmath104 follows from @xmath105 .",
    "the resulting expressions for @xmath5 and @xmath3 associated with the component @xmath106 are g_1^(1)(x ) & = & ^y_max_y_min dy x(2x - y ) ( 1- ) h_1(y ) g_2^(1)(x ) & = & ^y_max_y_min dy [ x(2y-3x)+(4 - 3 ) ] h_1(y ) [ eq:106 ] here , @xmath107 where @xmath108    notice that @xmath109 only if @xmath110 , i.e. @xmath111 are zero for @xmath112 .",
    "the above expressions do not satisfy the ww sum rules([eq:8 ] ) but @xmath113 does satisfy the bc sum rule([eq:9 ] ) exactly . to see this",
    "we assume that we can interchange the order of the @xmath114 integrations and use the fact that the support of @xmath83 , for fixed @xmath99 , is given by @xmath115 where @xmath116 and @xmath117 are solutions of @xmath118 .",
    "the @xmath119 component is irrelevent since it is orthogonal to @xmath120 and so @xmath121 vanishes .",
    "the @xmath122 component does contribute however and substituting into eqs([eq:3],[eq:4 ] ) gives the appropriate contributions to @xmath5 and @xmath3 g_1^(3)(x ) & = & mm^5^y_max_y_min dy dk^2 f_3(p , k , s ) g_2^(3)(x ) & = & mm^5^y_max_y_min dy dk^2 f_3(p , k , s ) [ eq:108 ] where @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 defined as above .",
    "the @xmath126 and @xmath127 defined by eq([eq:108 ] ) satisfy analogous sum rules to the ww sum rules in the limit @xmath128 .",
    "provided @xmath129 , which is true in any reasonable model ( see below ) , we can write in this limit _ 0 ^ 1 dx x^n-1 = 0 [ eq:109 ] this relation is interesting in that not only is the bc sum rule satisfied but also the first moment of @xmath127 vanishes which implies that @xmath127 is suppressed in general .",
    "when @xmath130 the @xmath131 sum rules both survive exactly .",
    "the above expressions , eq ( ) and eq ( ) , are quite general .",
    "as they involve two distribution functions , they do not lead to a relation between @xmath5 and @xmath3 .",
    "however , as we now discuss , the covariant parton model allows us to develop a plausible model to describe the source of the parton polarisation in the proton and hence to relate @xmath95 and @xmath132 .",
    "how are the partons polarised ?",
    "ultimately it is due to the interaction with the external magnetic field which causes the proton spin , through the interaction of the proton magnetic moment , to align with the field . at the parton level , while they too will interact directly with the magnetic field , they will also have spin - spin interations which align the individual parton spins .",
    "the latter interaction , being due to the strong force , may be expected to dominate the _ relative _ parton spin alignment which is what relates @xmath95 and @xmath132 . since , on average",
    ", any combination of parton spins is proportional to the proton spin we are led to a model in which the relative magnitude of @xmath133 is due to the spin - spin interaction between the partons themselves , the interaction being proportional to the scalar product of the individual parton spin with the proton spin .",
    "thus we have f_i(p , k , s ) = ( n_i.s)mf(p.k , k^2 ) [ eq:110 ] from eq([eq : nidef ] ) we have m(n_1.s ) & = & m(n_2.s ) & = & 0 m(n_3.s ) & = & -m [ eq:111 ] we see that factoring out @xmath134 in eq([eq:5 ] ) in the massless case is consistent with this model .",
    "the factor @xmath55 on the rhs of eq([eq:110 ] ) ensures the desired limit for the @xmath106 contribution as @xmath135 .",
    "we can now write @xmath136 in terms of @xmath137 , f_3(p , k ,",
    "s ) = f(k^2,y ) [ eq:112 ] and substitute into eqs([eq:108 ] ) to get g_1^(3)(x ) & = & m^2^y_max_y_min dy h_1(y ) g_2^(3)(x ) & = & m^2^y_max_y_min dy h_1(y ) [ eq:113 ] thus @xmath138 and @xmath139 are determined by a _",
    "single _ function once again , as in the @xmath140 case .",
    "the resultant prediction for @xmath56 in terms of the measured @xmath141 is pursued in the next section .    in leading order",
    "the final form of the quark mass effects consists of two pieces .",
    "the first which starts at @xmath142 comes simply from imposing parton kinematics on the scattering process .",
    "the second , of @xmath143 , is given in eq ( ) and comes from the transverse polarisation states .",
    "the question immediately arises whether it is the constituent or current mass that is relevant . at the level of the quark parton model itself",
    "this can not be answered as it is the qcd interactions that cause masses to  run \" .",
    "however one may make an educated guess as to the most appropriate choice .",
    "the calculation of the parton model process requires , for gauge invariance , that the mass of the intermediate parton be the same as that of the initial parton .",
    "the former should certainly be taken as the current - quark mass at the scale @xmath40 since the large momentum involved in the deep inelastic scattering process flows through it .",
    "hence the struck quark mass should also be taken to be the current - quark mass . as a result",
    "we expect the corrections of @xmath144 in eq ( ) to relate to the current quark mass .",
    "the kinematic corrections however have two origins .",
    "the first , due to the @xmath123 cut and from the form of the parton momentum @xmath145 , comes from putting the struck parton on mass shell and again for consistency should be taken to be the current - quark mass .",
    "the second , the @xmath124 cut , comes from imposing parton kinematics on the intermediate states in the lower bob of fig 1b .",
    "this must surely be the constituent mass as no large momenta are involved .",
    "however , in practice , the former effects are the most important and hence we expect the dominant mass effects to be assocated with the current quark mass ( in the phenomenological analysis given below we make no distinction between the various masses - consistent with the parton model interpretation - but , following this discussion , we expect the masses should be of current quark magnitude ) .",
    "fig.2 shows the present situation for the experimental measurements by slac@xcite , emc@xcite and smc@xcite for @xmath141 together with the recent preliminary measurements of @xmath56 at slac@xcite .",
    "the range of @xmath40 over which all the measurements are taken is fairly wide and , in principle , one should try to take account of possibly sizeable @xmath40 variation at fixed @xmath83 values .",
    "however we do not tackle this here as we are concerned here only with the challenge of trying to predict the size and shape of @xmath56 from that of @xmath141 at some canonical value of @xmath40 where the parton model may apply and , by definition , qcd corrections are assumed to be small .",
    "also shown in fig.2 is the expected @xmath146 prediction for @xmath56 where we fit to the data on @xmath141 using the expression eq([eq:6 ] ) with an assumed form for @xmath147 which is then inserted into eq([eq:7 ] ) to give @xmath56 .",
    "that is , the curve on fig.2 is the prediction for @xmath56 given by the ww relation eq([eq:1 ] ) .",
    "we find @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "certainly at large @xmath83 it is encouraging to see the preliminary @xmath3 data lying close to the ww expectation .",
    "note that , from eq([eq:1 ] ) , the prediction for @xmath56 at any @xmath83 value depends only on values of @xmath83 at and above that value and so is not sensitive to uncertainties in the small @xmath83 region .",
    "likewise , parametrisations of the distributions @xmath27 are not required to satisy various theoretical conjectures for the small @xmath83 behaviour since this region is quite irrelevant to our concerns here .",
    "our conclusion following from fig.2 is that the preliminary @xmath3 data , albeit with relatively large errors , is consistent with ww relation and hence , within the framework of the covariant partom model , consistent with a light quark mass of zero .",
    "the next step is to ask if the data are also consistent with a sizeable quark mass .    to answer this question",
    ", we carried out fits to @xmath150 using eqs.([eq:106],[eq:113 ] ) for @xmath78 up to 0.2 and a similar parametrisation for @xmath27 as in the @xmath146 case above .",
    "the resulting fits , together with the corresponding predictions for @xmath151 are shown in fig.3 .",
    "the quality of the fits is good provided @xmath152 , however the resulting @xmath153 never _ improves _ on the value of 59 for 50 data points achieved by the @xmath146 fit .",
    "this remains true even when more complicated parametrisations of @xmath27 are considered .",
    "the components of @xmath141 and @xmath56 associated with the @xmath106 and @xmath122 components of the parton polarisation are shown in fig.4 .",
    "as @xmath78 increases , @xmath154 grows at low @xmath83 @xmath4 the suppression of @xmath97 is largely offset by the denominator @xmath155 in the integrand @xmath4 and tends to spoil the quality of the fits .",
    "notice in fig.4 that each component of @xmath56 correctly integrates to zero and note how @xmath156 is suppressed relative to @xmath157 due to the vanishing of the first moment .    to quantify the violation of the ww sum rules in this particular model for the quark mass effects we consider the ratio @xmath158 given by r_n = [ eq:20 ] that is , @xmath158 is the ww moment normalised by the @xmath5 contribution to that moment . up to values of @xmath78 where the model is able to successfully describe the data , @xmath158 can be used as a direct measure of the quark mass . for values of @xmath159",
    "we get @xmath160 .    as the precision of the slac @xmath3 measurement increases",
    ", we expect that a phenomenological analysis such as this can offer a new and practical procedure for testing whether the quark model is a good approximation ."
