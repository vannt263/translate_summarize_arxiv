    "the large and small magellanic clouds ( lmc and smc ) are the nearest examples of star - forming , gas - rich dwarf galaxies .",
    "they sit well within the halo of the milky way , at galactocentric distances of @xmath9  kpc and @xmath10  kpc , respectively .",
    "their proximity renders them ideal targets for investigating a huge variety of different astrophysical problems ; their stellar populations can be easily resolved with ground - based facilities , and studied in exquisite detail .    a critical ingredient in understanding many of the peculiar features of the magellanic system  for example the striking off - centre bar in the lmc ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the broad age gap in the lmc star cluster system ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the vigorous ongoing star formation in both galaxies , the irregular morphology of the smc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the magellanic stream and bridge of hi gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* )  is the interaction history of the lmc and smc , both with each other and with the milky way .",
    "this is still not well constrained .",
    "it has only been during the last decade , with precision proper motion measurments from the _ hubble space telescope _ that evidence has mounted that the clouds have only recently fallen deep into the gravitational potential of the milky way ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and may indeed be on their first close passage . as a result it is possible that close encounters between the lmc and smc have been more influential in shaping their evolution and appearance ( e.g. , *",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the outskirts of the lmc and smc are of particular interest .",
    "these low - density regions are most susceptible to disturbances due to interactions between the two galaxies and due to the tidal force of the milky way .",
    "key questions are the extent to which the structure of the outer lmc disk exhibits evidence of distortion , the nature and extent of any stellar component stretching between the clouds in the magellanic bridge region , whether there is a stellar component associated with the magellanic stream , and whether either of the clouds possesses a spheroidal halo component or shows evidence for the presence of disrupted satellites . the latter may be expected because in the @xmath11cdm cosmological model structures are formed hierarchically at all scales , such that a number of the dwarfs in the local group could have experienced significant merger events within the past several gyr ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "studying the remote peripheries of the lmc and smc is observationally extremely challenging , requiring exceptionally low surface brightness features ( @xmath12 mag arcsec@xmath13 ) to be traced over large swathes of sky .",
    "although early studies utilising photographic plates were able to explore the morphology of the clouds at intermediate radii ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is only quite recently , with the advent of wide - field imagers and multi - object spectrographs mounted on medium and large aperture telescopes in the southern hemisphere , that the problem of tracing the lmc and smc to their outer limits has become tractable .",
    "the structure of the lmc is generally accepted to be that of a planar disk viewed at an angle inclined to the plane of the sky . pioneering work on the shape , structure and extent of the lmc disk was conducted by @xcite and @xcite using newly - available _ contiguous _ near - infrared data sets from 2mass @xcite and denis @xcite , that provided , for the first time , the opportunity to map the outer regions of the lmc via resolved red giant branch ( rgb ) and asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) star counts ",
    "i.e. , using ( old ) stellar populations characteristic of the lmc periphery .",
    "these studies showed that the outer disk , or at least its old component , appears rather smooth all the way to the edge of the region studied at @xmath14 from the lmc centre , and found a best - fit inclination angle of @xmath15 and exponential scale length of @xmath16 kpc .",
    "these values are consistent with those obtained by other studies conducted before and since at more central radii using similar tracers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as a variety of alternatives ( such as cepheids and hi gas ) , and incorporating both photometric and kinematic techniques ( see the extensive discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , @xcite observed tentative evidence for a decrease in the inclination angle with galactocentric radius , together with a twisting of the position angle of the line of nodes  both possibly indicative of warping of the lmc disk at large radii .",
    "moreover , @xcite found that the lmc disk likely has an intrinsic elongation , perhaps induced by the tidal force of the milky way .",
    "more recently @xcite have presented a panoramic view of the lmc in diffuse ( unresolved ) light out to @xmath17 using long exposures from small telescopes .",
    "they found evidence for faint stellar arcs and multiple spiral arms in the northern part of the disk , but with no comparable counterparts in the south .",
    "their numerical models suggest this type of asymmetric arrangement can arise as the result of repeated close interactions with the smc .",
    "the extent and structure of the lmc beyond the edge of the region studied by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite at @xmath18 is not well explored or understood . on the one hand ,",
    "spectroscopic measurements covering a significant number of disjoint fields at a wide variety of azimuthal angles and radial distances report kinematic detection of lmc rgb stars out to @xmath19 @xcite ; moreover , lmc populations have also been clearly detected , both kinematically and photometrically , in the foreground of the carina dwarf at a radial distance of @xmath20 from the lmc centre @xcite .",
    "@xcite hypothesise that these remote stars are indicative of a classical pressure - supported stellar halo surrounding the lmc . on the other hand ,",
    "deep photometric studies tracing old main sequence turn - off stars in stripes to the north @xcite and north - east @xcite observe a clear exponential decrease in surface density out to @xmath21 , suggesting that the smooth lmc disk extends at least 10 scale - lengths from its centre . beyond this radius ,",
    "neither work observes definitive evidence for lmc populations , and each posits that the lmc must be truncated , perhaps tidally , at approximately this point .",
    "most recently , @xcite have probed to even larger radii in the north and east using blue horizontal branch stars , and report the discovery of an apparently rather substructured distribution reminiscent of a stellar halo extending to at least @xmath22 .    in this paper",
    "we present a detailed investigation of the northern outskirts of the lmc , utilising images taken during the first year of the dark energy survey ( des ) and released publically through the noao science archive .",
    "in particular , we explore the geometry and extent of the lmc disk and periphery , and report on the discovery of a substantial stream - like stellar substructure situated to the north and north - east of the lmc , and stretching to a radius of at least @xmath23 from the galaxy s centre .",
    "our analysis is based on photometry derived from publically available images obtained in the first year of des operations .",
    "des @xcite utilises the @xmath24 megapixel dark energy camera ( decam ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) mounted on the 4 m blanco telescope at the cerro tololo inter - american observatory in chile .",
    "the decam imager consists of @xmath25 ccds arranged into a roughly hexagonal mosaic spanning a total field of view of @xmath26  deg@xmath27 with a pixel scale of @xmath28  pixel@xmath29 .",
    "the des survey area will ultimately spread over @xmath30  deg@xmath27 of the southern sky in _ grizy _ ; the first - year imaging spans around @xmath31  deg@xmath27 with mostly single - epoch coverage .",
    "this includes a region sitting predominantly to the north and west of the lmc , covering position angles between @xmath32 and @xmath33 at radii typically outside @xmath34 but reaching as close as @xmath35 to the lmc centre .",
    "overall , roughly three - eighths of the lmc disk beyond @xmath34 is covered by the year one des imaging .",
    "we utilise the photometric catalogue described by @xcite , and refer the interested reader to that paper for a full description of its construction . in brief ,",
    "source detection and measurement across all images was conducted using the _ sextractor _ and _ psfex _ software ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the individual detection lists were calibrated to the sdss scale using dr7 of the apass survey , cross - matched to remove duplications , and merged across different pass - bands into a final catalogue .",
    "star - galaxy separation was undertaken using the spread_model and spreaderr_model parameters provided by _",
    "( as defined in * ? ? ?",
    "general improvements were made to the processing over that reported by @xcite , including an enhanced photometric calibration utilising an `` uber - calibration '' procedure @xcite , extension of the processing to incorporate @xmath36-band data , and the use of all des imaging from the 2013 - 2014 season ( des y1 ) resulting in somewhat increased areal coverage .",
    "for the present analysis , only objects with clean stellar detections in the @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 filters were retained .",
    "this results in slightly brighter completeness limits than those reported by @xcite  by examining the position of the peak in source number counts we estimate that the catalogue starts to become significantly affected by incompleteness around @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 .    for all sources ,",
    "foreground reddening was corrected using the maps of @xcite and the extinction coefficients from @xcite appropriate for the sdss photometric system  i.e. , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 for the @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 bands respectively . in the direction of the northern outskirts of the lmc ,",
    "the reddening is very mild with a median colour excess of @xmath46 .",
    "in the leftmost panel of figure [ f : cmd ] we show a hess diagram for all stars in our catalogue lying in the range @xmath47 from the centre of the lmc .",
    "most prominent is the old stellar population of the outer disk , which is well described by an isochrone from the dartmouth stellar evolution database @xcite of age @xmath48  gyr , @xmath49fe@xmath50h@xmath51 = -1.1 $ ] , and @xmath52fe@xmath51 = 0.0 $ ] .",
    "our photometry reaches @xmath53  magnitude below the main - sequence turn - off belonging to this population .",
    "a distinct red clump is visible ( marked with a box ) , but only a very faint blue horizontal branch , indicating that the peak of the metallicity distribution function sits around @xmath49fe@xmath50h@xmath51 \\approx -1 $ ] or higher .",
    "this is consistent with previous investigations of outer lmc fields ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a trace younger population may extend to the blue but this is completely sub - dominant .",
    "the rightmost panel of figure [ f : cmd ] , shows a hess diagram for all stars in the range @xmath54 from the centre of the lmc , and a substantial younger component is clearly present .",
    "this demonstrates that such populations are almost completely confined to a radii smaller than @xmath55 , at least to the north of the lmc ",
    "again consistent with previous studies .",
    "for example , @xcite observed that populations younger than @xmath56 gyr were truncated at @xmath55 or @xmath57 from the lmc centre in their survey fields to the north - west .",
    "returning to the leftmost panel of figure [ f : cmd ] , the distance modulus required to shift the fiducial isochrone onto the ridgeline of the dominant old stellar population is @xmath58 .",
    "taken at face value , this suggests that the region of the lmc imaged in the year one des footprint mostly lies somewhat closer than does the galaxy centre , which has a distance modulus of @xmath59 ( throughout this work we assume the distance to the lmc centre to be @xmath60  kpc , * ? ? ?",
    "it is important to note , however , that our measurement is subject to systematic uncertainty of at least @xmath61 mag , due to the fact that we do not know precisely the age , metallicity , and @xmath62-element abundance of the stellar population(s ) in the cmd , and because distances derived using isochrones can be rather model - dependent .",
    "another notable feature of our cmd is that both the sub - giant branch and the red clump of the dominant old population are vertically quite broad . while this could be due to the presence of stars with a mix of metallicities and ( old ) ages",
    ", it might also reflect a spread in the distances to lmc stars in our catalogue .",
    "indeed , we find the latter possibility to be the most likely explanation  in the two central panels of figure [ f : cmd ] we plot hess diagrams for stars lying in the radial range @xmath47 , but at position angles @xmath63 ( centre ) and @xmath64 ( right )  i.e. , to the extreme east and west of the imaged region .",
    "a significant distance gradient is apparent , in the sense that stars further to the east are closer than those to the west .",
    "the sub - giant branch in the middle panel lies @xmath65  magnitudes above the fidicual isochrone , while that in the right - hand panel sits @xmath66 mag below the fiducial line ; there is also a striking difference in the red clump levels between the two cmds .",
    "these _ relative _ measurements are much more robust than our determination of the mean absolute distance modulus above . they are consistent , at least in a qualitative sense , with the recent work of @xcite , who examined the brightness of the red clump in populations lying within @xmath55 north - west of the lmc centre , and also @xcite who studied the brightness of agb stars as a function of radius and azimuth out to @xmath67 .",
    "the distance gradient is a result of the lmc geometry , which is usually assumed to follow that of an inclined disk with regions to the north and east tilted in front of the plane of the sky .        in the following analysis",
    "we aim to use main sequence turn - off stars belonging to the dominant old stellar population seen in figure [ f : cmd ] to trace the outer structure of the lmc",
    ". however , the apparent variation in distance between different regions of the galaxy makes uniformly selecting these stars problematic because we do not know , _ a priori _ , the line - of - sight distance to any given point on the sky , and the stellar density is much too low to reliably measure this quantity with the necessary spatial resolution .",
    "the simplest solution is to define a selection box on the combined cmd that is sufficiently broad to encompass the full vertical spread in the old population .",
    "this box is marked in figure [ f : cmd ] , and comes at the cost of a slightly higher level of non - lmc contaminants than we might have achieved with a more closely - tailored selection region is simply to help facilitate our discussion of this feature and its changing level with position .",
    "note also that while the red giant branch between the main sequence turn - off and the red clump is visible , we do not include this region in our selection box in order to minimise contamination from galactic foreground stars ",
    "see section [ ss : effects ] . ] .",
    "we set the faint limit of our selection box at a level that mitigates any potential issues due to the onset of ( spatially variable ) detection incompleteness at the level quoted in the previous section ( see also section [ ss : effects ] below ) . assuming that the apparent distance gradient from east to west is smooth",
    ", holding this faint limit constant with position will introduce an artificial density gradient on the sky .",
    "that is , a patch of given stellar density will be observed to be rather less dense in the west than in the east due to the cmd selection box in the west covering @xmath68  magnitudes less of the old population main sequence than it does in the east .",
    "we will return to this issue later in the paper ; for now we simply note that the size of this variation is of order @xmath69 per cent from the extreme eastern to western edges of the imaged lmc region .      in figure",
    "[ f : map ] we show a map of the spatial density of stars falling in our cmd selection box .",
    "this is a tangent - plane ( gnomonic ) projection where the tangent point is located at the centre of the lmc ( which we assume to lie at @xmath70 , @xmath71 as in * ? ? ?",
    "the dashed purple lines mark galactocentric radii of @xmath72 , @xmath57 , and @xmath73 ; within the central @xmath72 we have superimposed a wide - field optical image of the lmc to help place the periphery into perspective . in the des density map the outer lmc disk dominates to a radius of @xmath74 and possesses a mild but noticeable non - circular shape , as seen in previous studies at smaller radial distances ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "perhaps the most striking feature on the map is a distinct stream - like substructure stretching from @xmath0 due north of the lmc centre towards the eastern edge of the survey footprint .",
    "the apparent width of this feature on the sky is @xmath75 .",
    "additional faint structure is visible at commensurate radii to the west ; based on the density map alone , it is not clear whether this constitutes an extension to the main body of the substructure or whether it is unrelated ( but see also section [ ss : profile ] ) .",
    "the existence of this stream - like feature helps reconcile the results of several previous studies of the lmc outskirts :    1 .",
    "a number of authors , while investigating the carina dwarf galaxy , have noted the presence of probable lmc stars in the foreground .",
    "these include giants and red clump stars observed spectroscopically by @xcite and @xcite that appear to constitute a kinematically cold structure with heliocentric radial velocity @xmath76  km@xmath77s@xmath29 , as well as stars at the old main - sequence turn - off seen recently in a photometric study by @xcite .",
    "the map presented by these latter authors shows the lmc populations to be mostly concentrated around @xmath78 south of carina , with a relatively sharp edge . in figure [",
    "f : map ] we mark the position of the carina dwarf with a magenta point ; the outer circle marks a distance of approximately @xmath79 from the dwarf .",
    "extrapolating the position and direction of our stream - like feature a short distance off the eastern edge of the des footprint , we posit that these previous studies have very likely been detecting members of this substructure .",
    "@xcite detected lmc giant stars spectroscopically to a radius of @xmath80 to the north - east , north , and north - west , and to a radius of @xmath81 in the direction of carina .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite photometrically detected main sequence turn - off stars in fields to @xmath82 due north of the lmc , but not in fields at @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "our newly discovered substructure possesses a rather sharp drop off in density at @xmath85 due north of the lmc centre .",
    "this could explain the apparently conflicting results of these two studies if the stellar density beyond this `` edge '' fell below the faint detection limit of @xcite but not @xcite .",
    "lmc populations have now been detected photometrically in this direction beyond @xmath85 ( see e.g. , section [ ss : profile ] in the present work , and * ? ? ?",
    "+        it is important to check the impact of spatially variable foreground reddening , detection incompleteness , or contamination of the cmd selection box by non - lmc objects .",
    "each of these could , in an extreme case , give rise to an artefact that might mimic a stream - like feature ; more generally , these issues might alter the observed morphology or properties of the substructure .",
    "the upper left panel in figure [ f : effmap ] shows the variation in @xmath86 across the region of interest , from the @xcite dust map .",
    "as previously stated , in general the foreground reddening to the north of the lmc is mild , with a median value of @xmath87 . although the reddening increases in the east ( in the direction of the galactic plane ) , @xmath86 is still always below @xmath88 mag .",
    "most importantly , there is no feature in the reddening map that is consistent with that of our substructure .",
    "overall this suggests that variations in foreground reddening are not a significant factor for our analysis .    in the upper right panel in figure",
    "[ f : effmap ] we plot the spatial variation in the @xmath38-band magnitude where our catalogue starts to become significantly affected by incompleteness .",
    "we define this in @xmath89 bins by locating the turn - over in the stellar luminosity function and fitting a curve to determine the level at which the number counts fall to @xmath90 of this peak value .",
    "the intrinsic bin - to - bin scatter in this calculation is roughly @xmath91 mag . in general the completeness level",
    "is relatively consistent across most of the region of interest , although there is a systematic move to brighter magnitudes in the east .",
    "this could be due to a general decrease in image quality or the effective integration time ( i.e. , fewer available epochs ) near the edge of the des year one survey footprint .",
    "there is also a noticeable move to brighter magnitudes inside @xmath17 of the lmc centre due to crowding .",
    "near carina there is a small patch where the completeness level moves to much brighter magnitudes  this is a region of poor data quality ( see below ) .",
    "importantly , apart from this small patch , variations in the completeness level always occur at substantially fainter magnitudes than the cut - off level in our cmd selection box .",
    "this is by design , to ensure that spatially variable incompleteness does not affect our analysis .",
    "the bad patch of data falls squarely on the eastern end of our substructure , and may explain why , in figure [ f : map ] , the feature appears to peter out towards the edge of the survey area .    despite our cmd selection box",
    "being optimised to identify lmc main sequence turn - off stars , there will inevitably be some level of contamination by non - lmc objects .",
    "the two primary sources of contamination are unresolved background galaxies , and stars belonging to the galactic foreground .",
    "to investigate the former , we constructed a density map of objects classified as galaxies rather than stars according to the star - galaxy separation routine described in section [ s : data ] ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "while these objects are of course not _ unresolved _ galaxies , the expectation is that they will behave in a similar fashion .",
    "this density map is shown in the lower left panel in figure [ f : effmap ] . in general",
    ", the distribution of galaxies is relatively uniform across the survey area , with a few filamentary regions of excess .",
    "the substantial excess towards the central regions of the lmc is due to crowding and the consequent misclassification of stars as galaxies . the patch of bad data near carina reappears in this map  poor image quality in this region results in both the misclassification of stars as galaxies , and the previously - observed bright completeness limit .",
    "although there are a variety of galactic stellar populations in the foreground , not all of these will contaminate our lmc selection box on the cmd . in figure",
    "[ f : cmd ] we mark a second selection box ( using a dashed line ) , that is designed to pick out old main sequence turn - off stars in the magnitude range @xmath92  i.e. , at distances of @xmath93 kpc .",
    "the main sequences associated with these turn - off populations cut back towards the red and across the upper part of our lmc selection box ; therefore , they serve as a good proxy for exploring how the foreground contamination should vary with position .",
    "we show a density map for stars falling in this secondary selection box in the lower right panel in figure [ f : effmap ] .",
    "unsurprisingly , since most of the stars in the distance range under consideration will belong to the galactic halo , the distribution is very smooth .",
    "there is only a very mild gradient towards the east , approaching the galactic plane , presumably due to the nearest contaminants .",
    "in general the expected level of contamination from foreground populations is only a small fraction of that of lmc stars , even in the outskirts of the lmc disk and including our new stellar substructure .",
    "we note that this analysis does not include main sequence turn - off stars at distances beyond @xmath94 kpc , which will also fall into the lmc selection box ; however in these regions the galactic halo is expected to have a negligible surface density even compared to the foreground map plotted in figure [ f : effmap ] .",
    "finally , we note an interesting apparent overdensity of foreground stars towards the centre of the lmc  this excess is caused by young lmc populations , that are present only within @xmath95 of the centre , cutting across the foreground selection box on the cmd ( see the rightmost panel in figure [ f : cmd ] ) .    in summary",
    ", we have shown that spatially variable foreground reddening , detection incompleteness , and contamination of the cmd selection box by non - lmc objects can not explain the presence of the stream - like feature observed in figure [ f : map ] , and it is thus reasonable to conclude that this is a genuine low surface - brightness substructure in the outskirts of the lmc .",
    "figure [ f : mapsmr ] shows a second version of our stellar density map , tuned to enhance low surface brightness features in the lmc periphery .",
    "the faint structure in the outskirts of the disk to the west is clearly visible , as is some degree of structure to the south of the main stream - like feature stretching to the east . in order to explore the properties of the stellar populations belonging to this feature , we define a selection box around its densest section .",
    "as marked in figure [ f : mapsmr ] , this box is split into two equal regions ",
    "one covering the eastern half of the substructure and one covering the western half .",
    "stars deg@xmath13 and an increased degree of smoothing ( using a gaussian kernel of width @xmath96 ) .",
    "the selection box used to explore the properties of the stellar populations in the stream - like substructure is marked with a solid line , and the corresponding region used for the field subtraction is marked with a dashed line .",

    "[ f : mapsmr ] ]    in the left - hand panel of figure [ f : streamcmd ] we display a hess diagram showing all stars falling within the selection box ( i.e. , within both halves ) .",
    "although the foreground contamination is relatively severe , the signature of the substructure is clearly evident on this cmd  both an old main sequence turn - off and a red clump are visible .",
    "the fiducial isochrone that we used in figure [ f : cmd ] appears to match the locus of substructure stars quite closely , suggesting that the stellar population(s ) that constitute this feature are very similar to the dominant old stellar population seen in the outer lmc disk .             to investigate this further",
    ", we define a second box immediately to the north of the selection box for the substructure , that covers an equivalent area of sky and which we use to define a hess diagram for the foreground populations that contaminate our stream cmd ) ; however , these have a much lower spatial density than the substructure populations and so are of no consequence here . ] .",
    "we smooth both the `` substructure '' and `` field '' hess diagrams with a gaussian kernel of @xmath97  mag and then subtract the field distribution from that for the substructure via a straight grid point by grid point differencing .",
    "the resulting field - subtracted hess diagram is displayed in the centre - left panel in figure [ f : streamcmd ] .",
    "the fiducial isochrone clearly provides an excellent description of the substructure populations ; indeed even the distance of these populations appears to match quite closely to that of the isochrone .",
    "the red clump is clearly visible and corroborates this conclusion .",
    "we repeated this procedure for stars in the western and eastern halves of the substructure selection box , to obtain the hess differences plotted in the centre - right and right - hand panels of figure [ f : streamcmd ] .",
    "no significant variations in distance are evident from west to east along the feature , although we note that the cmd for the eastern half is very noisy due to the increasing level of foreground contamination in this direction .",
    "this result is consistent with the measurements of @xcite , who found that the lmc stars they observed in front of the carina dwarf lie @xmath98  kpc away ( i.e. , at a distance modulus @xmath99 ) .",
    "the arc length along the substructure from @xmath100 due north of the lmc centre to @xmath79 due south of the carina dwarf is @xmath101 on the sky , corresponding to a physical length of @xmath102  kpc . to estimate a lower limit for its luminosity",
    ", we added up the total amount of light from stars in both parts of our selection box that also sit within the main sequence turn - off selection box on the cmd , and subtracted the contribution of non - stream members using the field selection box . ignoring any differences between des @xmath103 and sdss @xmath103 , which are known to be small ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we transformed from sdss @xmath37 and @xmath38 magnitudes to the johnson @xmath3-band using the relationship defined by lupton on the sdss dr12 web page to obtain @xmath104 .",
    "however , the main sequence turn - off stars sitting in our cmd selection box represent only a fraction of the total substructure population  for example red giants , red clump stars , and faint main sequence stars are all excluded . to determine an approximate correction to account for light due to these missing populations we generated a luminosity function from the darthmouth stellar evolution database with the same age and metallicity as our fiducial isochrone , and based on an underlying @xcite mass function .",
    "this revealed that our cmd selection box encompasses only @xmath105 per cent of the total light expected from a stellar population with these characteristics , implying a total luminosity of @xmath106 .",
    "this is still , of course , a lower limit to the true luminosity of the structure because our spatial selection box covers only its brightest portion .",
    "we also note possible systematic uncertainties of up to @xmath107 mag due to any spread in the characteristics of the substructure populations that we are unable to detect using the presently - available cmds , as well as the inclusion of underlying disk populations that may or may not be appropriate depending on the origin of the feature ( see sections [ ss : profile ] and [ s : discussion ] ) . assuming that @xmath106 , the mean apparent @xmath3-band surface brightness of the substructure within the selection box is @xmath108  mag arcsec@xmath13 .      in order to try and obtain some insight into the origin of the stream - like overdensity",

    "this is due to the milky way disk , which lies roughly parallel to the edge of the survey footprint another @xmath19 further east .",
    "we have already discussed the issue of foreground contamination in section [ ss : effects ] ; here , we note that these contaminants make a non - negligible contribution to the surface density profile outside @xmath208  kpc ( marked with a grey dashed ellipse on the map and a vertical dotted line on the profile ) , which is the radius within which the main stream - like features are concentrated east of @xmath193 . the blue profile in figure",
    "[ f : profile ] should not be trusted outside @xmath200  kpc ; this contamination is the reason why the profile for all stars , in the upper panel of the plot , does not converge to the background level ( determined using the profile to the west of @xmath193 ) until very large radii .    in summary",
    ", we find that to the west of @xmath193 the lmc radial surface density profile shows clear evidence for very diffuse populations reaching out to @xmath203  kpc ( @xmath8 )",
    ". these may also be present to the east of @xmath193 , but we can not be certain due to increasing contamination from the galactic foreground .",
    "our observation of such remote lmc populations is consistent with the spectroscopic detection in many directions of probable lmc giants out to radii of @xmath8 by @xcite and @xcite , and the recent blue - horizontal branch star maps of @xcite .",
    "our _ overall _ lmc surface density profile shows a gentle break outside a radius of @xmath197  kpc from the best - fit exponential fall - off measured in section [ ss : geom ] to a flatter decline .",
    "this is quite similar to the profile observed by @xcite  although they assume an exponential scale length of @xmath209  kpc and a break radius of @xmath210  kpc , their spectroscopic data points ( top panel of their figure 2 ) exhibit a substantial spread and would also be compatible with our slightly longer scale length of @xmath211  kpc and larger break radius of @xmath197  kpc  @xmath0 .",
    "in addition we find that these remote populations have characteristics similar to those of stars in the outer lmc disk and in the stream - like overdensity we have discovered stretching to the east .",
    "this observation is again compatible with the spectroscopic observations by @xcite , which show an apparently flat metallicity profile out to @xmath19 , with a mean value of @xmath49fe@xmath50h@xmath51 \\sim -1.0 $ ] .    while @xcite interpret the break in their profile to indicate the presence of a classical halo around the lmc , the break in our overall profile",
    "can be fully explained by the stream - like feature extending east  when we construct a profile using only stars to the west of @xmath193 , where this overdensity is not present , it is well described by our best - fit exponential disk model over the full radial range out to @xmath203  kpc ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "this does not rule out the presence of a stellar halo ",
    "it is important to note that the fields observed by @xcite span a signfiicantly wider range in azimuth than does the present des footprint , and , moreover , the recent maps by @xcite tracing blue horizontal branch stars suggest an lmc halo component almost certainly exists",
    ". however , it does indicate that ( i ) the lmc exponential disk may extend further than previously suspected , at least in some directions , and/or ( ii ) the transition to a halo - like population is rather smooth such that it does not lead to a noticeable break in the profile ( at least to the north - west ) .",
    "if the disk indeed extends out to such large radii , this would be in contrast to some previous estimates for its truncation radius , which lie in the range @xmath212  kpc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we have already noted in section [ ss : map ] how the sharp drop off in density @xmath213 due north of the lmc could explain the apparent trunction in the profile of @xcite , and we suspect a similar effect could explain the `` edge '' seen at @xmath214  kpc to the north - west by @xcite . in this direction",
    "we observe the faint western structure extending to @xmath205  kpc ; it may be that our cmd selection box , which traces much more of the main sequence and main sequence turn - off region than that of @xcite , has facilitated the detection of extremely diffuse populations outside this radius  note that on the cmd in figure [ f : outercmd ] , lmc stars beyond @xmath198  kpc are only clearly detected below the turn - off .",
    "we have used year one des imaging to study the structure of the northern periphery of the lmc .",
    "we find evidence for a substantial stream - like stellar overdensity stretching from @xmath0 due north of the lmc centre towards the east .",
    "although this is , broadly speaking , a similar direction to that of the leading arm of the magellanic hi stream , there is no obvious correspondence between the two  the gaseous feature is _ much _ wider and more extended ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and there is at present no suggestion that our substructure comprises a stellar component to it .",
    "the width of our overdensity is @xmath215 , or @xmath216  kpc , and it spans an arc on the sky that is , at minimum , @xmath217 long  corresponding to a physical length greater than @xmath102  kpc .",
    "this assumes that the feature passes in front of the carina dwarf galaxy around @xmath23 north - east of the lmc , possibly explaining why a number of previous studies of this object have found evidence for lmc populations in their field of view ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that exhibit cold kinematics ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we can think of three possible scenarios for the origin of this structure :    * it might be the remains of a disrupted satellite of the lmc .",
    "recent searches have uncovered a substantial number of low - luminosity dwarf galaxies in the vicinity of the lmc @xcite , some of which may well be bound to the magellanic clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* it may be an overdensity in the remote outskirts of the lmc disk itself  perhaps akin to an extended spiral arm .",
    "the recent diffuse light imaging by @xcite has revealed similar structures extending to @xmath218 from the lmc centre . *",
    "it could be comprised of material that is being stripped from the outer lmc disk due to the tidal force of the milky way , or due to a recent close encounter with the smc .",
    "the observed properties of the substructure help shed more light on these possibilities .",
    "we find that the integrated luminosity of its brightest portion is @xmath106 .",
    "this sits in between the hercules dwarf ( @xmath219 ) and the draco and ursa minor dwarfs ( @xmath220 ) in the milky way system ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although we note that our measurement is a lower limit since we have not traced the full extent of the overdensity on the sky .",
    "our field - subtracted hess diagrams show that the stellar populations in the substructure are predominantly old , as would be expected for a faint dwarf , but , critically , they also have @xmath49fe@xmath50h@xmath51 \\sim -1 $ ] .",
    "this is much more metal - rich than would be expected for such a low luminosity system according to the luminosity - metallicity relation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* )  draco , ursa minor , and hercules all have @xmath49fe@xmath50h@xmath51 \\la -2 $ ] .",
    "it could be that the putative satellite was initially much more massive and has suffered extensive tidal destruction ; however the original system would need to have been unfeasibly large  nearly two orders of magnitude more luminous than at present , comparable to the fornax dwarf with @xmath221 .",
    "our photometry reveals that , in fact , the stellar populations seen in the stream - like feature are an excellent match for those found in the outer lmc disk .",
    "this is strongly suggestive that it is comprised of disk material  perhaps stars being tidally stripped from the disk , or an overdensity in the structure of the disk itself .",
    "many previous studies have found non - axisymmetric features in density maps of the lmc  there are spur - like structures , possibly spiral arms , in the inner regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; while at intermediate radii there are spur - like and shell - like features present ( e.g. , * ?",
    "* ) , some of which sit towards the north and progress from west to east ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "more recently , @xcite have revealed arc - like structures in the disk extending to @xmath17 .",
    "furthermore , we clearly observe additional structure of some description in the lmc disk at radii of @xmath222 ( see figure [ f : diskmaps ] ) , although the nature of these features is not clear at present . despite the fact that we detect no young populations at the radius of our overdensity , such that it is probably not a spiral arm in the traditional sense ,",
    "it is not difficult to imagine a scenario in which one or more close encounters between the lmc and smc ( as in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or between the lmc and the milky way , could give rise to transient `` ripples '' or perturbations in the outer lmc disk , or indeed remove material entirely into a stellar stream .    in either of these cases , it might be expected that the outer lmc disk ought to show some other signs of distortion .",
    "we have observed tentative evidence for this . by constructing models of inclined planar disks",
    "we find that the observed stellar density of the outer lmc disk on the sky , and its azimuthal distance profile , can only be simultaneously explained by an elongated disk .",
    "the necessary ellipticity is only mild , but might indicate the presence of tidal distortion ( see the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "it is also relevant that the orientation of the elliptical isodensity contours of the outer lmc is such that the major axis is aligned very close to the north - south direction on the sky , coinciding with the apparent location of the origin of the stream due north of the lmc centre .",
    "in addition to this , the position angle of the line of nodes in our best - fitting elliptical disk model is twisted relative to all previous determinations from more central regions , which may indicate a warp in the disk .",
    "our measured inclination is also lower than most estimates derived from the inner lmc ; indeed , it follows the general trend of decreasing inclination with radius observed by @xcite .",
    "finally , there is an offset in our absolute distance measurement to the outer lmc disk , which we find to be about @xmath223 mag brighter than predicted by our best - fitting planar model .",
    "while much of this offset can likely be attributed to systematics associated with deriving distances using isochrone models , it might also reflect warping or flaring of the disk , or some other kind of distortion along the line of sight .",
    "this type of non - planar behaviour at large radial distances is again possibly indicative of tidal perturbations or distortions in the outer disk .",
    "if our substructure is indeed comprised of stripped disk material , then its origin might be due to the tidal force of the milky way .",
    "this is the argument put forward by @xcite to explain the ( substantial ) intrinsic ellipticity they infer for the lmc disk  the orientation that they measure for the elongation points within @xmath224 of the direction of the galactic centre , which sits at a position angle of @xmath225 relative to the lmc centre .",
    "our results are in excellent agreement with this finding  the position angle of the line of nodes in our best elliptical disk model sits at @xmath226 , while the ellipticity on the sky is almost perfectly aligned in the north - south direction ( see e.g. , the lower panel of figure [ f : mlell ] ) . moreover , as expected in the case where our substructure is a stream induced by the tidal force of the milky way , its direction is roughly perpendicular to the disk elongation and quite well aligned with the latest _",

    "the lmc was modelled as a two component galaxy with a stellar disk and an nfw profile @xcite .",

    "our @xmath6-body model was integrated for 2 gyr .",

    "the simulation shows material being stripped from the northern part of the disk in the correct direction to give lmc debris near the location of the carina dwarf  thus at least qualitatively reproducing the properties of our stellar overdensity . in the model",
    "the stream debris is due to tidal stripping of the lmc , and the rate of this stripping is controlled by both the orientation of the lmc internal rotation and its orbital motion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as a consistency check we re - ran the simulation with the lmc in two orientations , prograde and retograde , and found enhanced and decreased stripping respectively , as expected .",
    "for the orientation used in our simulation , the direction of the lmc spin and the angular momentum of its orbital motion around the milky way differ by @xmath240 , so we expect a slight enhancement of the stripping over a non - rotating progenitor .",

    "the northern outskirts of the disk show a stream of tidally stripped debris qualitatively similar to our observed substructure .",
    "[ f : sim],width=302 ]    the smc is certainly a complicating factor , and indeed we can not rule out that our substructure is due to one or more close encounters between the two magellanic clouds , rather than simply due to the tidal force of the milky way .",
    "the smc sits at a position angle of @xmath242 relative to the lmc centre , which is broadly in alignment with the direction of the arc of our stream - like overdensity .",
    "this galaxy is believed to have had multiple close interactions with the lmc in the past  perhaps as recently as a few hundred myr ago , and perhaps passing as close as a few kpc from the lmc centre .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , probably stripped from the smc by just such an encounter .",
    "@xcite model the effects of a very close lmc - smc interaction , where the orbits are consistent with the observed proper motions ; amongst their findings is that such an interaction can substantially disturb the lmc disk and even give rise to possible stream - like features  in the particular case they consider this mainly occurs to the north and north - east of the lmc centre as we have observed .",
    "more recently , @xcite have conducted modelling in light of their discovery of stellar arcs and spiral arms extending to @xmath17 north of the lmc , and the absence of comparable features in the south .",
    "they show that repeated close passages of the smc can lead to precisely this type of asymmetric arrangement .",
    "together these computations show that , at least in principle , our lmc overdensity could arise due to interaction(s ) with the smc ; moreover , such encouters might also offer an explanation for the structure we observe in the lmc disk between @xmath222 .",
    "ultimately , new observations and more detailed modelling will be required to identify the most likely origin for our stream - like feature .",
    "a key question is whether a matching substructure exists due south of the lmc centre and stretching to the west  the tidal features seen around both m33 and ngc 147 due to the influence of m31 are quite symmetric in this regard , while the models of @xcite show that if the smc is responsible then the arrangement should be asymmetric ( i.e. , there should be no matching arc in the south ) .",
    "we note that radial velocity observations along our substructure should help determine whether this feature is a stream of material stripped from the outer lmc disk , or an overdensity in the disk itself .",
    "if the latter , then it ought to approximately follow the known disk rotation profile with position angle .",
    "if , on the other hand , it is a stream of tidal debris , then our @xmath6-body model predicts a much more constant velocity with position because the stripped material tends to simply proceed roughly along the lmc orbit rather than continuing to share in the disk rotation pattern .    finally , we have observed apparent evidence for lmc populations at radii of up to @xmath59  kpc ( @xmath8 ) to the north and north - west .",
    "this corroborates the results of previous studies that have spectroscopically detected apparent lmc populations in discrete fields at radii of up to @xmath19 and over a wide range of azimuthal angles ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; we are now beginning to create a fully - filled map of these regions .",
    "the nature of these extremely remote stars is not clear  while @xcite interpret them as a classical spheroidal halo , our radial density profile to the north - west is well described by our best - fitting inclined disk model over all radii beyond @xmath243 without evidently requiring a separate halo component .",
    "furthermore , it is not obvious whether these extremely remote stars could still be gravitationally bound to the lmc  we have observed material that may very well be in the process of being tidally stripped from the lmc at a radius of @xmath196  kpc from the galaxy s centre ; on the other hand , the kinematic measurements of @xcite suggest that the tidal radius of the lmc could be as large as @xmath244  kpc , and @xcite have observed possible lmc members extending to even larger radii .",
    "whether or not these outermost populations remain bound to the lmc is a particularly interesting question  if they are not , then the fact that we are still able to observe their presence would likely argue for the lmc only having entered the tidal influence of the milky way quite recently , such that it is possibly still on its first pass around the galaxy .",

    "<S> we report the discovery of a substantial stellar overdensity in the periphery of the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , found using public imaging from the first year of the dark energy survey . </S>",
    "<S> the structure appears to emanate from the edge of the outer lmc disk at a radius @xmath0 due north of its centre , and stretches more than @xmath1  kpc towards the east . </S>",
    "<S> it is roughly @xmath2  kpc wide and has an integrated @xmath3-band luminosity of at least @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the stellar populations in the feature are indistinguishable from those in the outer lmc disk . </S>",
    "<S> we attempt to quantify the geometry of the outer disk using simple planar models , and find that only a disk with mild intrinsic ellipticity can simultaneously explain the observed stellar density on the sky and the azimuthal line - of - sight distance profile . </S>",
    "<S> we also see possible non - planar behaviour in the outer disk that may reflect a warp and/or flare , as well as deviations that resemble a ring - like structure between @xmath5 from the lmc centre . based on all these observations , </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that our remote , stream - like feature is likely comprised of material that has been stripped from the outskirts of the lmc disk , although we can not rule out that it represents a transient overdensity in the disk itself . </S>",
    "<S> we conduct a simple @xmath6-body simulation to show that either type of structure could plausibly arise due to the tidal force of the milky way ; however we also recognize that a recent close interaction between the lmc and the smc may be the source of the stripping or perturbation . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we observe evidence for extremely diffuse lmc populations extending to radii of @xmath7  kpc in the disk plane ( @xmath8 on the sky ) , corroborating previous spectroscopic detections at comparable distances .    </S>",
