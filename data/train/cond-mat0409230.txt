    "the subject of low - dimensional quantum gases has a long pre - history .",
    "the influence of dimensionality of the system of bosons on the presence and character of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) and superfluid phase transition has been a subject of extensive studies in the spatially homogeneous case . from a general point of view , the absence of a true condensate in 2d and 1d at finite temperatures follows from the bogoliubov @xmath0 theorem and originates from long - wave fluctuations of the phase ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this has been expounded by mermin and wagner @xcite and by hohenberg @xcite , and formed a basis for later investigations .",
    "the earlier discussion of low - dimensional bose gases was mostly academic as there was no possible realization of such a system .",
    "fast progress in evaporative and optical cooling of trapped atoms and the observation of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in trapped clouds of alkali atoms @xcite stimulated a search for non - trivial trapping geometries .",
    "present facilities allow one to tightly confine the motion of trapped particles in one ( two ) direction(s ) to zero point oscillations . then , kinematically the gas is 2d ( 1d ) , and the difference from purely 2d ( 1d ) gases is only related to the value of the effective interparticle interaction which now depends on the tight confinement .",
    "recent experiments have already reached 2d and 1d regimes for trapped bose gases and studied some of the quantum degenerate states .",
    "these studies bring in new physics originating from a finite size of the system , spatial inhomogeneity , and finite temperatures .",
    "the present lectures cover most important issues in the physics of 2d and 1d trapped quantum gases : the nature of various quantum degenerate states , the role of interaction between particles , and the role of finite - temperature and finite - size effects .",
    "we start with describing a cross - over to the bec regime in ideal 2d and 1d bose gases with a finite number of particles .",
    "we will consider an equilibrium gas at temperature @xmath1 in the grand canonical ensemble , where the chemical potential @xmath2 is fixed and the number of particles @xmath3 is fluctuating . in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath4 ) this is equivalent to the description in the canonical ensemble ( fixed @xmath3 and fluctuating @xmath2 ) .    in any dimension and confining potential",
    "the gas is characterized by a set of eigenenergies of an individual particle , @xmath5 , with the index @xmath6 labeling quantum numbers of the particle eigenstates .",
    "the ( average ) total number of particles @xmath3 is then related to the temperature and chemical potential by the equation @xmath7 where @xmath8 are the equilibrium occupation numbers of the eigenstates .",
    "we now demonstrate how eq.([nnu ] ) allows one to establish the presence or absence of bec in 2d and 1d ideal bose gases .      in an infinitely large uniform gas",
    "the particle eigenstates are characterized by the momentum @xmath9 and the eigenenergy @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the mass of a particle .",
    "then eq.([nnu ] ) takes the form @xmath12 with @xmath13 being the dimension of the system , and @xmath14 the @xmath13-dimensional volume .    in the 2d case the integration in eq.([nk ] ) is straightforward and we obtain @xmath15<0 \\quad , \\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the thermal de broglie wavelength , and @xmath17 is the 2d density .",
    "the quantity @xmath18 is called the degeneracy parameter and in 2d it can be written as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the temperature of quantum degeneracy . in the limit of a classical gas , @xmath21 , eq.([mu2dun ] ) gives the well - known result @xmath22 .",
    "for a strongly degenerate gas , where @xmath23 , we obtain @xmath24 . unlike in the 3d case , the dependence @xmath25 is analytical and it shows a monotonic increase of the chemical potential with decreasing temperature up to @xmath26 . in the thermodynamic limit the population of the ground state ( @xmath27 ) remains microscopic .",
    "one thus can say that there is no bec in a finite - temperature ideal uniform 2d bose gas .",
    "the situation is similar for an infinite uniform 1d bose gas , where the degeneracy parameter is @xmath28 and the temperature of quantum degeneracy is given by @xmath29 , with @xmath30 being the 1d density . in the classical limit ( @xmath31 ) , and in the limit of a strongly degenerate gas ( @xmath32 ) , eq.([nk ] ) gives @xmath33 again , the chemical potential monotonically decreases with temperature and remains negative at any @xmath1 , which indicates the absence of bec .",
    "the absence of bec in infinitely large uniform 2d and 1d bose gases is a striking difference from the 3d case .",
    "this difference originates from the energy dependence of the density of states .",
    "the ( energy ) density of states is @xmath34 , where @xmath13 is the dimension of the system , and for the 3d gas it decreases with @xmath35 .",
    "therefore , at sufficiently low temperatures it becomes impossible to thermally occupy the low energy states while maintaining a constant chemical potential or density . as a result , a macroscopic number of particles goes to the ground state ( @xmath27 ) , _ i.e. _ one has the phenomenon of bec . in 2d and 1d",
    "the density of states does not decrease with @xmath35 and this phenomenon is absent .      for 2d and 1d bose gases in a harmonic confining potential",
    "the density of states is @xmath36 and the situation changes .",
    "the population of the ground state ( @xmath37 ) is @xmath38 for a large but finite number of particles in a trap , @xmath39 can become macroscopic ( comparable with @xmath3 ) at a small but finite negative @xmath2 .",
    "one then speaks of a cross - over to the bec regime .",
    "we first discuss the bec cross - over for the 2d bose gas in a symmetric harmonic confining potential @xmath40 . in this case",
    "the particle energy is @xmath41 , with quantum numbers @xmath42 being non - negative integers .",
    "the density of states is then @xmath43 , and the contribution of low - energy excited states to the total number of particles is negligible .",
    "therefore , separating out the population of the ground state , one can replace the summation in eq.([nnu ] ) by integration : @xmath44 assuming a large population of the ground state , from eq.([n0 ] ) we obtain @xmath45 , and the population of excited trap states proves to be @xmath46 this allows us to write eq.([nint ] ) in the form @xmath47=n_0-",

    "the cross - over region in the 1d case is much wider than in 2d .",

    "a true condensate can exist only at @xmath79 and , as mentioned in the introduction , its absence at finite temperatures originates from long - wave fluctuations of the phase @xcite .",
    "however , as was pointed out by kane and kadanoff @xcite and then proved by berezinskii @xcite , there is a superfluid phase transition at sufficiently low @xmath1 .",

    "recent monte carlo calculations @xcite established an exact relation between @xmath82 and @xmath86 for the weakly interacting 2d bose gas .    early theoretical studies of 2d systems have been reviewed by popov @xcite and have led to the conclusion that below the kosterlitz - thouless transition temperature the bose liquid ( gas ) is characterized by the presence of a _ quasicondensate _ , that is a condensate with fluctuating phase ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in this case",
    "the system can be divided into blocks with a characteristic size greatly exceeding the healing length but smaller than the phase coherence length . in each block",
    "one has a true condensate but the phases of different blocks are not correlated with each other .",
    "the kosterlitz - thouless transition has been observed in monolayers of liquid helium @xcite , and recently the observation of this transition has been reported for the 2d gas of spin - polarized atomic hydrogen on liquid helium surface @xcite .",
    "the kosterlitz - thouless transition is discussed in the lectures of benoit douot .    in this lecture",
    "we focus our attention on the interaction between particles and on the correlation properties of 2d bose - condensed gases .",
    "recently , the 2d regime was realized for trapped atomic bose - einstein condensates at mit @xcite , lens @xcite , innsbruck @xcite , and jila @xcite .",
    "this was done by a tight optical confinement of the particle motion in one direction @xcite , or by a fast rotation of the cloud leading to an increase in the size of the sample in two directions @xcite .",
    "we will focus special attention on how the nature of the bose - condensed state is influenced by a finite size of the system .",
    "we will consider weakly interacting gases with a short - range potential of interaction between particles .",
    "in this case the total interaction energy is equal to the sum of pair interactions and can be written as @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the coupling constant for the pair interparticle interaction , @xmath3 is the number of particles , and @xmath14 the volume . accordingly",
    ", the interaction energy per particle is equal to @xmath89 , with @xmath85 being the 2d density .",
    "let us now discuss the conditions which are required for the 2d gas to be in the weakly interacting regime .",
    "the commonly used criterion assumes that the mean interparticle separation @xmath90 greatly exceeds the characteristic radius of interaction between particles , @xmath91 . in the 2d case",
    "we have @xmath92 and thus obtain the inequality @xmath93    the weakly interacting regime requires that at interparticle distances of the order of @xmath90 , the wavefunction of particles is not influenced by the interaction between them . relying on this requirement , we develop a physical picture which will be used for finding how the criterion of the weakly interacting regime depends on the dimensionality of the system .",
    "we consider a box of size @xmath90 , which on average contains one particle . in the limit of @xmath26 ,",
    "the particle kinetic energy is @xmath94 .",
    "the wavefunction of the particle is not influenced by the interparticle interaction if @xmath95 is much larger than the interaction energy per particle , @xmath89 .",
    "the inequality @xmath96 immediately gives the criterion of the weakly interacting regime in terms of the density and coupling constant . in the 2d case",
    "this criterion takes the form @xmath97    in the 2d gas at @xmath26 the coupling constant is ( see , e.g. @xcite ) @xmath98 where a length @xmath99 depends on the shape of the interatomic potential and in the absence of scattering resonances is of the order of @xmath91 .",
    "then , from eq.([critg ] ) we immediately arrive at the criterion ( [ crit ] ) .",
    "however , on approach to a resonance , the value of @xmath99 is quite different from @xmath91 , and one should return to the criterion ( [ critg ] ) .    in the dilute limit eq.([g * ] ) gives @xmath100 , except for the case where a weakly bound state of colliding atoms is present .",
    "then the length @xmath99 is extremely large and even at very low densities one can have the condition @xmath101 leading to an attractive mean - field interaction ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "however , in this case the 2d bose gas at @xmath26 is unstable with regard to collapse .",
    "note that in the 3d case we have the coupling constant @xmath103 and @xmath104 , with @xmath105 being the 3d density , and @xmath106 the 3d scattering length .",
    "the condition @xmath96 then leads to the well - known criterion @xmath107 , required for the weakly interacting regime in the 3d gas . in the absence of resonances ,",
    "the 3d scattering length is of the order of @xmath91 and this criterion is equivalent to the inequality @xmath108 .    in ongoing experiments ,",
    "two - dimensional atomic gases are obtained by ( tightly ) confining the motion of particles in one direction to zero point oscillations @xcite and , in this respect , can be called quasi2d @xcite .",
    "kinematically the gas is two - dimensional , but the value of an effective 2d coupling constant @xmath88 for the interparticle interaction depends on the particle motion in the tightly confined direction .",
    "let us first make a qualitative analysis of the interactions in such quasi2d gas .",
    "it can be viewed as a 3d gas which is uniform in two directions ( @xmath109 and @xmath110 ) , and is confined to zero point oscillations by a harmonic potential @xmath111 in the third direction ( @xmath112 ) .",
    "the quasi2d regime requires the inequality @xmath113 where @xmath85 is the number of particles per unit area in the @xmath114 plane and represents the 2d density of the quasi2d gas .",

    "collisional properties of cold atoms strongly confined in one direction have been of great interest in the studies of spin - polarized atomic hydrogen .",
    "the interest was related to inelastic and elastic collisions in the 2d gas of hydrogen atoms adsorbed on liquid helium surface ( see @xcite for review ) .",
    "the creation of atomic gases in the quasi2d regime @xcite opens new handles on studying 2d features of interparticle collisions , and provides spectacular evidence for the relation between the quasi2d scattering parameters and those in 3d .",
    "theoretical studies of elastic and inelastic interactions in the quasi2d regime have been performed in @xcite , and it has been shown how a decrease of the tight confinement transforms this regime into the 3d one @xcite .    here",
    "we consider elastic scattering of two atoms in the quasi2d regime @xcite .",
    "so , the atoms are ( tightly ) confined to zero point oscillations in the axial ( @xmath112 ) direction , and their motion in two other ( @xmath121 ) directions is free at a large separation in the @xmath114 plane . for a harmonic axial confinement , the motion of two atoms interacting with each other via the potential @xmath122 can be still separated into their relative and center - of - mass motion . the latter drops out of the scattering problem .",
    "the relative motion is governed by the potential @xmath122 and by the potential @xmath123 originating from the axial confinement with frequency @xmath124 . in the quasi2d regime one has the condition @xmath125 where @xmath126 and @xmath127 are the energy and wavevector of the motion in the @xmath114 plane .",

    "the scattering is determined by the contribution of the @xmath132-wave for the motion in the @xmath114 plane . in the axial direction ,",
    "the atoms are tightly confined and the axial harmonic oscillator length @xmath133 plays the role of their axial de broglie wavelength .",
    "therefore , we also require the condition @xmath134 which will allow us to consider only the @xmath132-wave for the three - dimensional relative motion of the atoms when they approach each other to short distances .",

    "<S> recent developments in the physics of ultracold gases provide wide possibilities for reducing the dimensionality of space for magnetically or optically trapped atoms . </S>",
    "<S> the goal of these lectures is to show that regimes of quantum degeneracy in two - dimensional ( 2d ) and one - dimensional ( 1d ) trapped gases are drastically different from those in three dimensions and to stimulate an interest in low - dimensional systems . </S>",
    "<S> attention is focused on the new physics appearing in currently studied low - dimensional trapped gases and related to finite - size and finite - temperature effects . </S>"
