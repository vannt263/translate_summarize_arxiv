    "<S> the structural stability , electronic structure , and thermal transport properties of one to six quintuple layers ( qls ) of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 are investigated by van der waals density functional theory and semi - classical boltzmann theory </S>",
    "<S> . the bandgap amounts to 0.41 ev for a single ql and reduces to 0.23 ev when the number of qls increases to six . </S>",
    "<S> a single ql has a significantly higher thermoelectric figure of merit ( 0.27 ) than the bulk material ( 0.10 ) , which can be further enhanced to 0.30 by introducing 2.5% compressive strain . </S>",
    "<S> positive phonon frequencies under strain indicate that the structural stability is maintained .    </S>",
    "<S> thermoelectric ( te ) materials have been extensively studied for key applications such as the conversion of waste heat into electricity . </S>",
    "<S> they have huge potential to contribute to a solution of the energy and environment crisis . </S>",
    "<S> the efficiency of te devices is determined by the dimensionless figure of merit @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the electrical conductivity , @xmath4 is the seebeck coefficient , @xmath5 is the temperature , and @xmath6 is the thermal conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> the latter comprises lattice ( @xmath7 ) and electronic ( @xmath8 ) contributions : @xmath9 . in order to achieve a high efficiency , the te material has to be a good electrical and poor thermal conductor and , at the same time , has to possess a high seebeck coefficient , see , for example , ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and the references therein . </S>",
    "<S> nanostructuring , alloying , and the application of strain are effective and frequently used approaches @xcite to improve te properties , because the phonon scattering is enhanced and the thermal conductivity consequently is reduced .    </S>",
    "<S> the class of topological insulators has been proposed to be of particular potential for te materials @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a well known example is bismuth telluride ( bi@xmath0te@xmath1 ) , which shows a high figure of merit of about 1 @xcite , but also many other members of this family of materials , such as bi@xmath0se@xmath1 and sb@xmath0te@xmath1 , are topological insulators with an energy gap in the bulk and gapless surface states . </S>",
    "<S> the high mobility of the surface electrons combined with the bulk energy gap give rise to the superior thermoelectric properties . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , superlattices of te - based materials ( bi@xmath0te@xmath1/sb@xmath0te@xmath1 @xcite , pbse@xmath10te@xmath11/pbte @xcite ) and nanocrystalline bi@xmath12sb@xmath13te@xmath1 @xcite have been reported to exhibit a high @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the best performing materials contain te , which is an expensive element and of limited availability . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , alternative materials ( for example based on se ) are required . </S>",
    "<S> bi@xmath0se@xmath1 is a topological insulator with an energy gap of 0.3 ev in the bulk . </S>",
    "<S> it has a rhombohedral crystal structure with lattice parameters of @xmath15   and @xmath16   ( space group @xmath17 ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the layered structure is based on slabs of five shifted se and bi atomic layers stacked along the @xmath18-axis with the sequence se(1)-bi - se(2)-bi - se(1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> such a slab is called quintuple layer ( ql ) and has a thickness of about 1 nm . along the @xmath18-axis the qls are connected by weak van der waals ( vdw ) forces . </S>",
    "<S> although the vdw interaction is relatively weak , it still plays a crucial role for the electronic and te properties .    </S>",
    "<S> various approaches have been proposed to improve the te properties of bulk bi@xmath0se@xmath1 , such as the introduction of point defects and doping of sb , cu , or ca atoms to tune the carrier concentration @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recent reports show that mechanical exfoliation of a single ql and of slabs of a few qls of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 is possible and that excellent te properties can be expected in such thin films @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> sun and coworkers @xcite have shown that the te behavior of a single ql of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 is enhanced because of a reduced @xmath6 , as compared to the bulk value . </S>",
    "<S> when the number of qls increases the bandgap of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 decreases and is finally closed at a thickness of eight qls @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this strong variation of the bandgap with the thickness will play a vital role for the tunability of the te properties . in this context , we investigate the effect of the thickness in terms of the number of qls on the electronic structure and transport behavior . </S>",
    "<S> we will demonstrate a high figure of merit for a single ql of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 and will argue that the value can be further enhanced by tensile strain ( for which we show that the material remains stable ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we have carried out first principles calculations based on density functional theory , employing the generalized gradient approximation of the exchange correlation potential in the perdew - burke - ernzerhof flavor . </S>",
    "<S> the vdw interaction is taken into account by means of the b97-d functional @xcite as implemented in the quantumespresso code @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> all calculations are performed with a plane wave energy cutoff of 544 ev and a monkhorst - pack @xmath19 k - mesh for the brillouin zone integrations . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we employ finer @xmath20 and @xmath21 k - meshes for calculating the density of states ( dos ) and transport properties , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> all structures are optimized until an energy convergence of 10@xmath22 ev and a force convergence of 0.025 ev / are reached . </S>",
    "<S> a 15   vacuum slab is used to prevent artificial interaction with periodic images due to the employed periodic boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the phonon frequencies are determined by density functional perturbation theory for evaluating the structural stability @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> once self - consistency is achieved in the first principles calculations , the transport properties are calculated using the semi - classical boltzmann theory within the constant relaxation time approximation , as implemented in the boltztrap code @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this approach yields accurate results for various types of te materials @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the transport function is given by @xmath23 the electrical conductivity by @xmath24 and the seebeck coefficient by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the fermi function , @xmath27 the scattering time , @xmath28 the fermi velocity , and @xmath29 the chemical potential .    in order </S>",
    "<S> to built supercells for one to six qls of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 , we start from a single ql using the bulk structural parameters and optimize the in - plane lattice constant , obtaining a slight elongation to @xmath30  . the thickness of the ql increases from the experimental bulk value of 6.966   @xcite to 7.096  , similar to the results in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we then keep the @xmath31 lattice constant for all systems fixed at the value obtained for the single ql and relax in each case the atomic positions . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting values for the layer thickness ( @xmath32 ) and separation between adjacent qls ( @xmath33 ) are summarized in fig .  1 . </S>",
    "<S> while effects of the vdw correction expectedly are negligible for a single ql , our values for @xmath32 and @xmath33 for two and more qls are larger than previously reported @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we note that we use an optimized lattice constant , while these authors have employed the bulk value . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the vdw correction is significant and can not be ignored in the case of two and more qls in order to obtain correct results for @xmath32 and @xmath33 . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> our calculated energy gaps better reproduce the experiment @xcite than ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , see the band structures of the relaxed systems in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 . </S>",
    "<S> this improved agreement is due to the larger @xmath34   ( as compared to @xmath35  ) . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that the single ql has a bandgap of 0.41 ev , which decreases step by step to 0.23 ev for six qls , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 . </S>",
    "<S> the largest seebeck coefficient and figure of merit thus are expected for a single ql of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> we next apply both compressive and tensile strains of 2.5% and 5% to explore the effects on the te response . in the single ql case </S>",
    "<S> the layer thickness is reduced to 6.725   and 6.920   for 5% and 2.5% tensile strain , respectively , and grows to 7.470   and 7.280   for 5% and 2.5% compressive strain . </S>",
    "<S> particularly , at 2.5% tensile strain the value is almost equal to the bulk lattice constant . </S>",
    "<S> the band structures of a single ql of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 under strain are depicted in fig .  4 together with the corresponding phonon dispersions : the bandgap reaches 0.60 ev for 5% compressive strain and decreases to 0.16 ev for 5% tensile strain . </S>",
    "<S> 2.5% tensile strain applied to a single ql of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 has about the same effect as an increase of the thickness to 4 qls . </S>",
    "<S> this is just an example to demosntrate that the bandgap can be tune almost idependently by the strain and the number of qls , which is a great advantage from the technology point of view .    </S>",
    "<S> we obtain positive phonon frequencies in the whole range of strain under study for the single ql , which demonstrates a wide stability window . </S>",
    "<S> there are 15 phonon modes at the center of the brillouin zone , 12 optical and 3 acoustical . </S>",
    "<S> the optical modes consist of a@xmath36 and a@xmath37 out - of - plane modes and e@xmath38 and e@xmath39 in - plane modes . </S>",
    "<S> nanostructured bi@xmath0se@xmath1 is subject to a red shift of the frequencies of the above modes due to phonon softening . </S>",
    "<S> the out - of - plane phonon softening is explained by the finite size along the @xmath18-axis , resulting in a reduction of the restoring force . in an unstrained single ql of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 , </S>",
    "<S> the e@xmath39 and a@xmath37 frequencies are 129.3 @xmath40 and 174.8 @xmath40 , respectively , and thus close to the experimental bulk values of 131 @xmath40 and 174 @xmath40 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> strain effects on the a@xmath37 frequency are addressed in fig .  5 in comparison to the variation of the bandgap , in order to demonstrate the analogous behavior of these two quantities . under tensile strain </S>",
    "<S> the frequency decreases , i.e. , the out - of - plane phonons soften , while in the case of compressive strain it increases .    </S>",
    "<S> the grneisen parameter for the a@xmath37 mode ( i.e. , the g mode at the @xmath41 point ) is given by @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the difference of the frequencies with and without strain and @xmath44 is the frequency of the unstrained single ql . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain positive values of 1.2 and 2.6 for 2.5% and 5% tensile strain , respectively , because the distance between the bi and se sublattices is reduced . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , negative values appear for compressive strain . </S>",
    "<S> so far no experimental data are available for comparison , though an experimental confirmation of our predictions by raman spectroscopy would be desirable .    </S>",
    "<S> we now turn to the te properties of nanostructured bi@xmath0se@xmath1 with varying thickness . @xmath4 and @xmath45 are shown in fig .  6 as functions of the hole doping @xmath46 ( in @xmath47 ) . the highest seebeck coefficient is found for the single ql around @xmath48 @xmath47 . at low doping the value progressively reduces when the number of qls grows , because the bandgap decreases . above </S>",
    "<S> @xmath49 @xmath47 the seebeck coefficient decreases in each case for increasing hole doping . </S>",
    "<S> the reasons for the particularly high values found for the single ql are ( 1 ) the maximal bandgap and ( 2 ) the qualitatively different shape of the valence bands .    </S>",
    "<S> the boltztrap code obtains the electrical conductivity as @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate @xmath51 for bi@xmath0se@xmath1 by comparing the calculated values of @xmath50 and @xmath4 with the experimental values of @xmath4 and @xmath3 at 300 k , which results in @xmath52 s. this value is used for all subsequent calculations of the te properties . a similar methodology has been used to establish the relaxation time in bi@xmath0te@xmath1 @xcite and has led to reasonable agreement with the experiment . the assumption that @xmath51 is independent of both the thickness and the strain is supported by previous theoretical work on sb@xmath0te@xmath1 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , a thermal conductivity of @xmath53 w / km at a temperature of 300 k has been reported for nanostructured bi@xmath0se@xmath1 in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and is used in the following .    according to fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 6 , the maximum of @xmath45 for the single ql is found at a hole doping of @xmath54 @xmath47 , which is below the degenerate limit . </S>",
    "<S> it shifts to higher @xmath46 when the number of qls grows , except for the case of 2 qls . </S>",
    "<S> can the value be further improved by strain ? </S>",
    "<S> we find that the maximal seebeck coefficient shifts to higher and lower hole doping , respectively , for tensile and compressive strain . while @xmath45 is reduced by tensile strain as well as by strong compressive strain , a moderate compressive strain results in a significant enhancement around @xmath55 @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> using the experimental @xmath53 w / km and calculated @xmath52 s we estimate a figure of merit of 0.27 for the single ql , which is remarkably more than the bulk value ( 0.10 ) . a moderate compressive strain ( 2.5% ) </S>",
    "<S> further enhances the value to 0.30 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , it can be expected that @xmath4 and thus the figure of merit grow with the temperature and that a decreasing @xmath51 for higher doping also has positive effects .    in conclusion , we have established the dependence of the te properties of nanostructured bi@xmath0se@xmath1 on the thickness of the material and on applied compressive and tensile strain by density functional theory and semi - classical boltzmann theory . we have demonstrated that a careful description of structural properties , mainly the thickness of the qls and their separation , as determined by the van der waals interaction , are essential for obtaining quantitatively correct bandgaps . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that the bandgap decreases when the number of qls increases , which results in smaller seebeck coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> the bandgap of a single ql of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 reaches a value of 0.6 ev for 5% compressive strain , whereas we obtain 0.16 ev for 5% tensile strain . </S>",
    "<S> we have confirmed the structural stability of the systems under strain by means of phonon dispersions . </S>",
    "<S> the highest figure of merit is found in the thinnest system ( single ql ) and our results demonstrate that it is further enhanced by compressive strain . </S>",
    "<S> a value of 0.30 is achieved for a feasible strain of 2.5% , which is three times the bulk value . </S>",
    "<S> strain engineering of nanostructured bi@xmath0se@xmath1 therefore turns out to be a highly efficient approach for creating high performance te materials . </S>"
