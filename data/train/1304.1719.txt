    "the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics @xcite has successfully passed the numerous experimental tests performed so far .",
    "the recent observation of the higgs particle @xcite at the lhc @xcite also seems to confirm the mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking , which is responsible for masses of the known gauge bosons and fermions . on the other hand , we know that the sm is not complete .",
    "firstly , it does not provide a viable dark matter candidate .",
    "secondly , it predicts that the active neutrinos are strictly massless , which contradicts the results of neutrino oscillation experiments . a simple yet elegant way to generate small but nonzero neutrino masses is to add three right - handed majorana neutrinos to the model : @xmath1 where @xmath2 are the heavy majorana fields , @xmath3 are the lepton doublets and @xmath4 is the conjugate of the higgs doublet .",
    "after the electroweak symmetry breaking the active neutrinos receive naturally small masses through the type - i seesaw mechanism .",
    "this scenario has even more far - reaching consequences as it can explain another beyond - the - sm observation , the baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
    "the majorana mass term in ( [ lagrangian ] ) violates lepton number . in the early universe a decay of the majorana neutrino into a lepton - higgs pair increases",
    "the total lepton number of the universe by one unit , and a decay into the corresponding antiparticles decreases the total lepton number by one unit . if there is _",
    "cp_-violation then , on average , the number of leptons produced in those decays is not equal to the number of antileptons and a net lepton asymmetry is produced .",
    "it is also known that whereas the difference of the lepton and baryon numbers is conserved in the standard model , any other their linear combination is not @xcite .",
    "this implies that the lepton asymmetry produced by the majorana neutrinos is partially converted to the baryon asymmetry @xcite .",
    "this mechanism , which is referred to as baryogenesis via leptogenesis , naturally explains the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe . for a more detailed review of leptogenesis see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the state - of - the - art analysis of the asymmetry generation uses boltzmann equations with the decay and scattering amplitudes calculated in vacuum .",
    "their applicability in the hot and expanding early universe is questionable and can be cross - checked using a first - principle approach based on the use of non - equilibrium quantum field theory .",
    "one of the most important processes for the generation of the asymmetry is the decay of the majorana neutrino .",

    "a first - principle analysis of such processes free of the notorious double - counting problem has been presented in @xcite .",
    "the second category includes @xmath0 decay and scattering processes mediated by the higgs .",
    "the latter processes are also known to play an important role in the asymmetry generation and are addressed in the present paper .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec.[canonicalapproach ] we briefly review the canonical approach to the analysis of the @xmath0 processes and derive the corresponding amplitudes and reduced cross - sections . in sec.[neqftapproach ] we derive quantum - generalized boltzmann equations for the lepton asymmetry , calculate the effective amplitudes of the higgs - mediated scattering processes and compare them with the canonical ones .",
    "the obtained boltzmann equations are used in sec.[rateequations ] to derive a simple system of rate equations for the total lepton asymmetry . in section sec.[numerics ] we present a numerical comparison of the corresponding reaction densities with the ones obtained using the canonical approach . a summary of the results is presented in sec.[summary ] .",

    "the first term in ( [ loopfunction ] ) is related to the self - energy and the second term to the vertex contribution .",

    "effective one - loop diagram for the self - energy and vertex contributions to the decay of the lightest majorana neutrino for a strongly hierarchical mass spectrum . ]    in both cases most of the asymmetry is typically generated by the lightest majorana neutrino , whereas the asymmetry generated by the heavier ones is almost completely washed out .",
    "for a strongly hierarchical mass spectrum , @xmath9 , the intermediate majorana line in figs.[treevertexself].b and [ treevertexself].c contracts to a point , see fig.[hierarchicalloop ] , and the structure of the self - energy and vertex contributions is the same . in this limit : @xmath10 note that in this approximation the loop integral leading to ( [ loopfunctionhierarchical ] ) depends only on the momentum of the initial state and is independent of the momenta of the final states .",
    "this implies in particular that this expression can also be used for off - shell final states .    using the effective couplings ( [ effective couplings ] ) we find for the decay amplitudes ( squared ) @xcite :    [ effamplmajdecay ] @xmath11    where we have summed over flavors of the leptons in the final state as well as over the majorana spin ( @xmath12 ) and the @xmath13 group ( @xmath14 ) degrees of freedom . here",

    "the @xmath0 processes are also _ cp_-violating .",
    "cp_-violation is generated by the same self - energy and vertex diagrams .",

    "in other words , for a strongly hierarchical mass spectrum we still can use the effective couplings ( [ effective couplings ] ) supplemented with ( [ loopfunctionhierarchical ] ) to calculate the _ cp_-violating scattering amplitudes .    summing over flavors and colors of the quarks and leptons in the initial and final states as well as over the corresponding @xmath13 and spin degrees of freedom we find for the amplitude of @xmath27 scattering : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the feynman ( or time - ordered ) propagator of the intermediate higgs and we have defined @xmath30 here @xmath31 is the @xmath32 factor , and @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the momenta of the singlet and the doublet respectively . for the charge - conjugate process",

    "the dashed red line corresponds to the _ cp_-violating parameter computed using the sum of ( [ lrhodecay ] ) and the _ scattering _ ( lines two to four ) contributions to ( [ lrhosimple ] ) . as expected , at high temperatures we observe an enhancement of the ratio , whereas at low temperatures it reaches unity .",
    "the solid red line is obtained by considering the sum of ( [ lrhodecay ] ) and all of the terms in ( [ lrhosimple ] ) .",
    "since the three - body process is kinematically suppressed at high temperatures , the dashed an solid lines overlap for @xmath270 . at lower temperatures the quantum - statistical effects are small . however , in agreement with the discussion below ( [ lsvacuum ] ) , the effective thermal masses of the higgs and quarks lead to a slow rise of the ratio at low temperatures ."

    "<S> in this work we study the contribution to leptogenesis from @xmath0 decay and scattering processes mediated by the higgs with quarks in the initial and final states using the formalism of non - equilibrium quantum field theory . starting from fundamental equations for correlators of the quantum fields we derive quantum - corrected boltzmann and rate equations for the total lepton asymmetry improved in that they include quantum - statistical effects and medium corrections to the quasiparticle properties . to compute the collision term we take into account one- and two - loop contributions to the lepton self - energy and use the extended quasiparticle approximation for the higgs two - point function . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting _ cp_-violating and washout reaction densities are numerically compared to the conventional ones . </S>"
