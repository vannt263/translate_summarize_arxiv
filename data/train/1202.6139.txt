    ", it is known that the south - west side is receding ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , either the north - west or south - east side is the near side .",
    "we do not see an obvious forward scattering excess in the nir image .",
    "however , since the spirals are typically trailing , it is inferred that the south - east is the near side .",
    "figure [ fig : profiles ] also shows the radial @xmath11 profiles along the major axis , which is roughly consistent with @xmath80 in the outer part , indicating a flat ( not highly flared ) disk @xcite .",
    "the radial slopes vary as pa from @xmath81 to @xmath82 ( fitting at @xmath83 ) or from @xmath84 to @xmath85 ( fitting at @xmath86 ) , with shallower slopes typically appearing in the minor axis directions .",
    "however , @xmath80 is representative on average .",
    "this slope is observed in several other haebe disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * for total intensity data ) , although hd 97048 disk exhibits a shallower slope @xcite .",
    "among several features in the image , the most interesting one is the non - axisymmetric spirals . in order to understand them ,",
    "we propose a model based on the spiral density wave theory ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , assuming that nir emission traces the disk surface density structure .",
    "with such a model , the spiral structures can be used to infer the disk temperature , independently of , for example , co line observations .",
    "the shape of the spiral density wave is determined by the location of the launching point ( corotation radius @xmath87 ) and disk s thermal and rotation profiles .",
    "when the disk rotation angular frequency is @xmath88 and the sound speed is @xmath89 , the shape of the wave far from @xmath87 is given by @xmath90     \\label{spiralform }    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the polar coordinate @xmath91 , where @xmath92 denotes the disk aspect ratio at @xmath93 and @xmath94 gives the phase .",
    "equation ( [ spiralform ] ) well approximates the shape of the density wave given by the wkb theory @xcite .",
    "when the spiral is excited by a planet in a circular orbit , its location is @xmath95 .",
    "equation ( [ spiralform ] ) has five parameters , @xmath96 .",
    "two non - axisymmetric features , s1 and s2 , ( figure [ fig : maxima ] ) are identified as follows .",
    "first , local maxima in the radial sb profiles normalized by @xmath97 ( to take into account the dilution of the stellar flux ) are traced at every @xmath98 step with data at @xmath99 ( s1 ) and at @xmath100 ( s2 ) .",
    "the points near the minor axis ( @xmath101 ) are excluded because the structure there may be affected by depolarization .",
    "the points at @xmath102 ( s1 ) and @xmath103 ( s2 ) may be a part of axisymmetric rings since they are found to have constant radii .",
    "after removing these points , we have 27 ( s1 ) and 56 ( s2 ) points as representing samples of non - axisymmetric spirals , with the opening angle of @xmath104 for both s1 and s2 .",
    "we estimate that the uncertainty of the location of the maxima is given by the fwhm of the psf .    in order to fit the non - axisymmetric structures by equation ( [ spiralform ] ) ,",
    "we fix @xmath105 and @xmath106 at @xmath107 ( kepler rotation ) and @xmath108 , respectively , as in @xcite , while other parameters are varied as @xmath109 .",
    "note that different values of @xmath106 yield similar results .",
    "since it is difficult to fit s1 and s2 simultaneously , they are fitted independently .",
    "the `` best - fit '' parameters are @xmath110 for s1 ( reduced @xmath111 ) and @xmath112 for s2 ( reduced @xmath113 ) .",
    "the spiral shapes with these parameters are shown in figure [ fig : maxima ] .",
    "however , the parameter degeneracy is significant .",
    "figure [ fig : parameterdegen ] shows the parameter space of @xmath114 with @xmath115 confidence level for @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "note that in figure [ fig : parameterdegen ] , the `` best - fit '' of @xmath114 is outside the domain of confidence in some cases because @xmath118 is not the same as the best - fit . despite the parameter degeneracy ,",
    "the values of the aspect ratio which fit the shape of the spiral ( @xmath119 ) are consistent with those obtained from the sub - mm map of the disk ( e.g. , @xmath120 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the spiral density wave theory predicts that the pattern speed deviates from the local kepler speed ; @xmath121\\ ] ] is not necessarily equal to @xmath122 .",
    "when @xmath123 , the spiral will move @xmath124 in a decade , corresponding to movement of @xmath125 . considering the psf scale of our observations and the locations of the spirals , such deviations can be detectable over a couple of decades .",
    "moreover , if the two spirals have distinct corotation radii , their relative locations change in time due to the pattern speed difference .",
    "such measurements will confirm that the observed feature is really the density wave , providing indisputable evidence of dynamical activity .",
    "note that it would be difficult to detect spirals in colder disks ( smaller @xmath118 ) , where spirals are more tightly wound , due to the blurring by the psf .",
    "the lower detectable limit of @xmath118 is typically @xmath126 for our set of parameters .",
    "the combination of high angular resolution and warm temperatures allows the spiral structure in the sao 206462 disk to be resolved .",
    "further spirals might be detectable in similarly warm disks .",
    "in this letter , we present a high - resolution image of the sao 206462 transitional disk using subaru / hiciao , with an inner working angle of @xmath49 . we discover non - axisymmetric spiral features , which can be explained by the spiral density wave theory with a reasonable value of the disk aspect ratio ( @xmath127 ) .",
    "the model is robust in a sense that it does not assume the origin of such structure explicitly .",
    "the detection of scattered light within the sub - mm cavity itself is interesting , since @xcite predicts that the sub - mm cavity is heavily depleted .",
    "our data in tandem with the millimeter data may suggest that the depletion of grains at different sizes is not uniform .",
    "@xcite discuss such discrepancies between sub - mm dust continuum images and nir scattered light images in terms of differing spatial distributions as a function of grain size from a general theoretical perspective .",
    "our major assumption is that @xmath11 at @xmath0-band , tracing the scattered light at the disk surface , actually traces the surface density variations .",
    "this assumption is valid when the disk is in vertical , isothermal hydrostatic equilibrium without rapid radial surface density variations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "structures near the midplane are , however , preferentially observed at longer wavelengths with high spatial resolution : atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) can be an ideal instrument .    among several possible causes for the spiral structures",
    "( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , one interesting idea is that planets excite them . in this case",
    ", the domain of possible locations of the planets is given by the green curves in figure [ fig : parameterdegen ] .",
    "if the two spirals have distinct corotation radii , there may be two ( unseen ) planets embedded in the disk .",
    "the amplitude of the surface density perturbation scales with the planet mass as @xmath128 for non - gap - opening low - mass planets ( @xmath129 , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in our data ,",
    "the amplitude of the spiral wave is typically @xmath130 ( figure [ fig : image ] ) , implying @xmath131 .",
    "the typical error of @xmath11 in our image is @xmath132 .",
    "if this is typical of hiciao , it is capable of detecting the indirect signatures of planets down to @xmath133 .",
    "adi is promising in finding a point source ; however , small field rotation ( @xmath134 ) due to the southerly declination ( @xmath135 ) of sao 206462 makes obtaining the total intensity difficult in our data .",
    "future @xmath136-band observations may reveal thermal emission from a planet , if it exists , or its surrounding ( accreting ) gas .",
