    "owing to the small effective aperture of our observation , we deemed it prudent also to consider effects of ( diffractive ) scattering by grains upon interstellar extinction .",

    "we did not investigate more sophisticated grain - scattering models , because using the simple scattering model ( eq .",

    "in particular , we note the following :    1 .",
    "independent of the cross - section model , it is impossible to fit the data using the abundances of anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) .",
    "models invoking the anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) abundances will fit the data if the oxygen is underabundant with a fractional abundance of @xmath80 .",
    "3 .   if abundances recommended by wilms et al .  ( 2000 ) are used , the fits become acceptable independent of the various cross - sections used .",
    "4 .   in all cases with statistically acceptable fits ,",
    "the best - fit relative oxygen abundance is basically the same .",
    "5 .   using the wilms et al .  ( 2000 ) abundances with oxygen somewhat underabundant consistently gives a better fit than if the abundance is fixed at the nominal value .",

    "does not appreciably alter the quality of the fit ; thus , while such extinction is expected , these spectral data do not require it . 7 .   including dust scattering",
    "consistently modifies the best - fit parameters in an understandable way   the resulting photon index @xmath14 is slightly flatter and the hydrogen column @xmath15 and relative oxygen abundance [ o / h ] are slightly lower .",
    "the range of best - fit values for @xmath15 substantially exceeds the statistical error of that parameter , demonstrating the importance of systematic uncertainties produced by using different cross - sections and/or abundances .",
    "here we compare our measurements of the broadband spectrum with certain previous measurements   those taken with the _ einstein _  focal - plane crystal spectrometer ( fpcs ) by schattenburg & canizares ( 1986 ) , with the _ beppo_-sax  low - energy concentrator spectrometer ( lecs ) by massaro et al .",

    ", they did did not resolve the pulsar from the nebula .",
    "their analysis did allow for the impact of flux scattered outside of the spectrometer s 6-diameter aperture upon the overall normalization .",
    "the model fitting of the _ einstein _",
    "data froze the nebula s power - law index at @xmath85 and used cross - sections and abundances from morrison & mccammon ( 1983 ) , but did not report the goodness of the fit .",
    "if the quality of the fit were poor , statistical uncertainties in @xmath86 and @xmath87 may be underestimated , although the authors noted that they deliberately inflated the statistical errors in the data above 0.7  @xmath5  in their spectral fitting , perhaps to avoid this problem . in what follows",
    ", we shall first assume that the uncertainties are not underestimated . before comparing results we note",
    "that their freezing the spectral index lowers the uncertainty relative to a fit with the spectral index left as a free parameter , but the differences may not be very large and their choice of spectral index ( 2.1 ) appears to be a very accurate value for the nebula - averaged index at low x - ray energies ( see the discussion in  [ s : xmm ] ) .",
    "similarly , we find for the _ chandra _  data , e.g. , that the uncertainty in @xmath15 and @xmath88 change by less than 10% depending on whether @xmath89 is left as a free parameter or fixed at the best - fit value .",
    "thus , if we compare the _",
    "einstein_-derived values for the hydrogen column and the relative oxygen abundance with our measurements , we see that the values for @xmath86 are similar within the errors , essentially independent of which cross - sections and abundances we used , whereas there appears to be a statistically significant discrepancy in the relative oxygen abundance",
    ". we shall see shortly (   [ s : bepposax ] &   [ s : xmm ] ) that this discrepancy is with all the more recent measurements . moreover , willingale et al .",
    "( 2001 ) find that the column is rather uniform across the nebula ( see  [ s : xmm ] ) , thus eliminating variations in the column as a possible reason for the discrepancy .    in order to try to understand the source of this discrepancy",
    ", we also compared the measured optical depths at the oxygen edge , which are directly related to the data independent of any models for abundance and cross - section .",
    "following schattenburg & canizares ( 1986 ) , we omitted 2 of the 6 fpcs data points that lie closest to the oxygen edge as outliers , which they note are perhaps biased by neutral - oxygen @xmath90 absorption and by the k edge of singly ionized oxygen . scaling their quoted uncertainty in the fractional abundance of oxygen",
    ", we find @xmath91 . if we include all 6 fpcs data points in the analysis , we find @xmath92 , with a very poor fit ( @xmath93 for 3 degrees of freedom ) .",

    "we also see no reason as to why the systematic errors that schattenburg & canizares ( 1986 ) applied to the data above 0.7 kev do not also apply below 0.7 kev .",
    "this would surely increase the uncertainty . as we have shown",
    "the fpcs result is sensitive to precisely which data is included in the fit , and , we suspect , to the precise modelling of the details of the spectral structure . we can only conclude that either the _ einstein_-fpcs uncertainties in the measured oxygen column ( relative oxygen abundance ) are underestimated or some systematic effect in the response has escaped detection .      massaro et al .",
    "( 2000 ) used various _",
    "beppo_-sax  instruments to measure the spectrum of the nebula and pulsar , which are spatially unresolved even using the _ beppo_-saxx - ray concentrators . of relevance to our measurements ,",
    "the low - energy concentrator spectrometer ( lecs ) obtained a phase - resolved 0.14.0-@xmath5  spectrum of the nebula and pulsar . by analyzing the spectrum from the `` low - pulse '' phases , they minimize the pulsar contribution relative to the nebula .",

    "thus , re - analysis of the _ beppo_-sax  data also indicates that oxygen in the crab line of sight to be underabundant with respect to anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) abundances , however , not as much as our results .",

    "the selected data sets isolated various crab spatial structures   including the jet , the nebula as a whole , and the pulsar .",
    "the joint spectral fits to these data sets employed different power - law indices for each region but the same column density , with cross - sections from balucinska - church & mccammom ( 1992 ) plus newer he cross - section ( yan et al.1998 ) and with abundances from anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) .",
