    "the buildup of stellar mass over cosmic time is a central issue in understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies .",

    "this is done using a wide variety of tracers from the ultraviolet ( uv ) to the radio .",
    "generally , all such measures trace the formation rate of higher - mass ( typically o and b ) stars , while the bulk of the stellar mass forming in lower - mass stars is not directly detected . hence measuring the true rate of stellar growth",
    "requires assuming a conversion between the particular tracer flux and the total stellar mass being generated  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "galaxies are converging on a broad scenario for the cosmic star formation rate evolution  @xcite .",
    "galaxies at high - redshift appear to be more gas - rich and forming stars more rapidly at a given stellar mass than present day galaxies ( see the recent review by * ? ? ?",
    "the cosmic star formation rate density rises slowly from early epochs to peak between redshifts 1 - 3 , and then declines toward = 0 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this global evolution is also reflected in measurements of the star formation rates of individual galaxies , which grow significantly at a given stellar mass from today out to @xmath8 , prior to which they show a much slower evolution  ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ".    meanwhile , recent advances in near - infrared capabilities have enabled measurements of the buildup of stellar mass out to high redshifts , as traced by more long - lived stars ( typically red giants ) .",
    "nominally , the integral of the cosmic star formation rate , when corrected for stellar evolution processes , should yield the present - day cosmic stellar mass .",
    "analogously , the time differential of the stellar mass evolution should be the same as measured star formation rate .",
    "thus in principle there is now a cross - check on the rate of high - mass stars forming relative to lower - mass stars .",
    "preliminary comparisons along these lines have yielded general agreement out to @xmath9  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". however , moving to higher redshifts into the peak epoch of cosmic star formation , there are growing hints of discrepancies : the integrated cosmic star formation rate density seems to exceed the observed stellar mass function  ( accounting for stellar mass loss ; * ? ? ?",

    "these discrepancies are relatively mild , at the factor of two to three level , so could perhaps be resolved by a more careful consideration of systematic uncertainties in sfr and @xmath0 measures . indeed , some analyses fail to show strong discrepancies  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . nevertheless , it is interesting that when discrepancies are seen , they unanimously favor the idea that the observed stellar mass growth appears slower than expected from the observed sfr .",
    "theoretical models have made a number of advances toward understanding the observed properties of star - forming galaxies at high redshifts .",
    "simulations advocate a picture in which continual gas accretion from the intergalactic medium ( igm ) feeds galaxies with fresh fuel ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and ultimately drives star formation @xcite . in such models ,",
    "stars typically form at rates proportional to the global gas accretion rate from the igm , regulated by feedback processes  @xcite .",
    "such a scenario predicts a fairly tight and nearly linear relation between star formation rate and stellar mass for star - forming galaxies  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "observations have now identified and quantified such a relation out to 6 - 8 @xcite , which has come to be called the `` main sequence '' of galaxy formation .",
    "the bulk of cosmic star formation appears to occur in galaxies along this main sequence , while merger - driven starbursts contribute @xmath10 globally  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although this scenario broadly agrees with observations , a small but persistent discrepancy has been recently highlighted between the evolution of the main sequence in simulations and observations , particularly during the peak epoch of cosmic star formation ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "in it , the rate of stellar mass growth at these redshifts in models is typically smaller by @xmath12 than the observed star formation rates .",
    "this discrepancy exists for both cosmological hydrodynamic simulations @xcite , as well as semi - analytic models ( sams ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and is to first order independent of model assumptions about feedback  @xcite .",
    "this is further seen in both the global cosmic star formation rate  @xcite as well as when comparing individual galaxies at a given @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "similarly , galaxy formation simulations that utilise a variety of methods all show a paucity of galaxies that form stars as rapidly as galaxies with the highest star formation rates at 2 , the sub - millimetre galaxies ( smgs ) @xcite . in all cases ,",
    "the models tend to favor lower true sfrs than implied by using available tracers and using conversion factors based on a canonical imf .",
    "one possible but speculative solution to all these discrepancies is that the stellar imf in galaxies at @xmath8 is different than what is measured directly in the galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the discrepancies described above , between the various observations as well as between models and data , would all be mitigated by an imf that forms somewhat more high - mass stars than low - mass ones at those epochs compared to the present - day imf .",
    "nevertheless , it is important to point out that at present , no firm evidence that the imf varies strongly from the locally observed one ( see the review by * ? ? ?",
    "locally , some observations suggest that a top - heavy / bottom - light imf may apply to the galactic centre @xcite . similarly , @xcite and @xcite suggest a turnover mass a factor of @xmath13 larger than in a traditional @xcite imf in the nearby starburst galaxy m82 .",
    "simultaneous fits to the observed cosmic star formation rate density , integrated stellar mass measurements , and cosmic background radiation favour a `` paunchy '' imf that produces more stars at intermediate masses @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that the imf may be more top - heavy at high - redshift ( 0.8 ) based on an analysis of the evolution of the colours and mass - to - light ratios of early - type galaxies .",

    ", some observations find evidence for a _ bottom - heavy _ imf in = 0 early - type galaxies@xcite .",

    ", we explore the cosmological consequences of a _ physically - based _ model for imf variations .",

    "finally , we emphasise that what governs the jeans mass in gmcs is the physical conditions in the ism , not the global morphology . as such , both",
    "heavily star - forming discs ( e.g. the  population at 2 ) as well as galaxy mergers may exhibit warmer ism gas relative to today s discs .",

    "similarly , high-  disc galaxies that are forming stars at many tens of  for a much longer duty cycle may show an increased  in their gmcs by a factor @xmath64 .",
    "the increase in temperature of the ism is typically driven by warm dust and increasing fractions of molecular gas above the gas - grain coupling density with increasing sfr .",

    "this of course owes to the fact that in our model , galaxies with larger inferred sfrs ( using a standard salpeter or kroupa imf ) undergo a larger correction to their sfr when the imf varies with the jeans mass .",

    "the cosmological simulation predictions now match the observations quite well in amplitude ( around @xmath120 ) , but the slope is now more discrepant . a selection effect that could explain this discrepancy is that low sfr galaxies tend to be absent from these samples , creating a floor in observed sfrs that increases to higher redshifts .",

    "we leave a more detailed comparison to models for a later time ( since in detail , an evolving imf would have secondary implications for galaxy evolution in these models that are not accounted for by this simple rescaling ) . for now , we simply illustrate how galaxy sfrs could be significantly lowered by an evolving imf during the peak epoch of cosmic star formation .",
    "an important constraint on sfr-@xmath0 evolution is that its amplitude appears to be essentially constant from @xmath121  @xcite .",
    "simulations , on the other hand , tend to predict an amplitude that continues to rise , albeit at a slower pace than at lower redshifts .",
    "hence as discussed in @xcite , if the imf varies in some systematic way with redshift in order to reconcile models and data , then the evolution must _ reverse _ at higher redshifts .",
    "this would require that the typical sfrs of galaxies at @xmath122 should be lower at earlier epochs .",
    "such an evolution is at least qualitatively consistent with the observation that @xmath123 decreases going to higher redshifts ( i.e. the universe is  upsizing \" at that early epoch , not downsizing ) . on the other hand , at very high redshifts ,",
    "the cmb temperature rises accordingly , setting a larger minimum ism temperature ( and hence a larger minimum jeans mass ) . in this sense",
    ", it is not quite obvious how to reconcile the potential discrepancy between the observed normalisation of the sfr-@xmath0 relation and modeled one .",
    "a quantitative comparison will require a more thorough analysis of the data versus the models , which we leave for the future .",
    "sub - millimetre galaxies at high redshifts are the most rapidly star - forming galaxies known , and hence likely represent an extreme of ism physical conditions where our imf scenario would predict the largest variations .",
    "indeed , theoretical models attempting to reproduce smgs have sometimes resorted to invoking imf variations in order to explain these systems .",
    "semi - analytic models with a canonical imf have difficulty matching the number counts of high-  infrared and sub - millimetre luminous galaxies @xcite , and have invoked as a solution that the imf is more top - heavy in these merger - driven starbursting systems . on the other hand ,",
    "the required imf variation in this scenario is rather extreme , namely a flat imf above @xmath124 , which is disfavoured by observational constraints on the imf from measuring the gas , stellar , and dynamical mass of smgs  @xcite .",
    "the simulations of @xcite suggest a different origin for smgs , as the high - mass , high - sfr end of the @xmath125 galaxy main sequence .",
    "while these models can broadly reproduce many properties of smgs , they do not achieve the high sfrs inferred from the smg observations , falling short by a factor of @xmath126 .",
    "this is similar to the correction factor predicted in equation  [ eq : sfrlir ] for the most ir luminous galaxies .",
    "hence if the imf varied in the manner considered here , this scenario for the origin of smgs would be strengthened .",
    "conversely , recent hydrodynamic simulations of isolated galaxies and galaxy mergers ( similar to those presented here ) , coupled with dust radiative transfer calculations and semi - empirical cosmological simulations have shown that the number counts of high-  sub - millimetre selected galaxies may be accounted for while utilising a kroupa imf @xcite , at least within the current uncertainties .",
    "these models suggest that pairs of galaxies blended within a single far - ir beam may be an important observational bias at lower flux densities , and that the relationship between sub - millimetre flux density and sfr may not be linear owing to substantial variations in dust temperatures during the merger phase .",
    "if the observed number counts from upcoming surveys turn out to be in good agreement with these predictions at a range of far - ir wavelengths , then an imf - based solution may be unnecessary .    while they differ in detail , both the @xcite and @xcite models suggest that the lowest luminosity smgs ( @xmath127 mjy ) galaxies may represent individual , heavily star - forming discs , whereas more luminous smgs likely owe their origin to galaxy mergers . in hydrodynamic cosmological simulations ,",
    "individual discs rarely sustain sfrs at rates larger than @xmath128 @xcite .",
    "utilising equation  [ eq : sfrlir ] , this corresponds to luminosities @xmath129 , and may reflect a transition luminosity where objects above this are typically mergers at 2 .",
    "recent analysis of the specific star formation rates and -@xmath130 relation for high-  smgs by @xcite suggests that this may indeed represent a transition luminosity between galaxy populations . at @xmath129 ,",
    "the -@xmath130 relation steepens dramatically , and galaxies rise above the `` main - sequence '' of specific star formation rates at 2 @xcite .",
    "moreover , models by @xcite show that @xmath131 represents a transition luminosity above which the luminosity function is dominated by mergers at 2 .",
    "if a salpeter imf holds for 2 smgs , a sfr of 500 would correspond to @xmath132 , an implausibly low transition luminosity given 2 merger rates @xcite .    in short",
    ", achieving the extreme sfrs inferred for smgs at their observed number densities using a canonical imf remains a challenge for hierarchical - based models .",
    "while observations are sufficiently uncertain to be broadly consistent with a variety of scenarios , tensions could generally be alleviated if the sfrs were a factor of several lower in these systems as would be the case for the varying imf presented here .",
    "our model form for the imf suggests a reasonable transition luminosity for the break between discs and mergers at 2 , given a rough maximal sfr for a quiescent disc of @xmath133 ( @xmath131 ) .      ]",
    "deep surveys have permitted measurements of the evolution of the star formation rates per unit volume over cosmic time .",
    "similarly , increased sensitivities in the near - infrared have allowed for a more robust reconstruction of the global stellar mass evolution in galaxies out to 3 . in principle , the integral of the star formation rate density , corrected for stellar mass loss , should be equivalent to the stellar mass density at a given redshift .",
    "a number of authors have noted , however , that there may be a discrepancy between these two quantities , such that the cosmic sfr density appears to be overestimated @xcite .",
    "as alluded to in   [ section : introduction ] , an imf weighted toward more high mass stars at high-  may go some length toward solving this issue .",
    "does an imf that varies with the jeans mass of gmcs reduce the inferred sfrs of high-  galaxies enough to remove the discrepancy between the integrated sfr density and the observed stellar mass density ? to answer this , we need to determine how a varying imf would impact the inferred global sfr density . to do this ,",
    "we employ a functional form for the observed luminosity function of galaxies as a function of redshift that is quite successful in matching existing data from @xcite .",
    "we integrate this functional form as a function of luminosity to calculate the typical number of galaxies per mpc@xmath134 as a function of redshift ( integrated to 0.1@xmath123 ) .",
    "we similarly utilise this information to calculate a luminosity and sfr density as a function of redshift .",
    "this information combined with the average number density of galaxies as a function of redshift allows us to calculate the typical sfr per galaxy as a function of redshift .",
    "we then apply the correction given in equation  [ eq : sfrlir ] after converting to an infrared luminosity via the @xcite relations , and assuming @xmath135 .",
    "figure  [ figure : madau ] shows the resulting sfrd evolution assuming an unevolving kroupa imf ( purple ) , versus the model evolving imf assuming @xmath136 ( red dashed ) .",
    "the unevolving imf curve is in good agreement with the sfrd compilation by @xcite when corrected to a kroupa imf ; for clarity , we do not show the individual data points . while the evolving imf makes a large difference to the sfrs of very rapidly starforming galaxies ,",
    "the global effect is less dramatic , since the sfrd tends to be dominated by more modestly starforming systems .",
    "nonetheless , it is clear that it lowers the sfrd significantly at all @xmath116 .",
    "@xcite suggested a variable imf that was empirically constructed to reconcile the cosmic sfrd evolution with the present - day stellar mass density .",
    "the resulting sfrd evolution in this model is shown as the blue dot - dashed line in figure  [ figure : madau ] . the imf model presented here results in less of a correction to the present - day stellar mass , since it is clearly closer to the original unevolving case over much of cosmic time .",
    "hence it remains to be seen if the imf model in this work can actually reconcile these measurements , although it is clear that it goes some distance towards this .",
    "the standard kroupa imf forms roughly twice as many stars today as are accounted for in stellar mass density measurements , whereas our model imf forms @xmath137 the wilkins et al . estimate .",
    "this said , an evolving imf is not necessary to reconcile the differences between the cosmic sfrd evolution and stellar mass density .",
    "for example , utilising cosmological sph simulations , @xcite suggest that the two can come into better agreement if the stellar mass density measurements are missing faint , low - mass galaxies .",
    "similarly , @xcite have suggested that the evolution of the stellar mass density and integral of the cosmic star formation rate density may not be discrepant .",
    "they argue that if one integrates the luminosity function to a common limit ( accounting for the evolution of @xmath123 with ) , then some of the observed discrepancy between the star sfrd and stellar mass density can be removed .",
    "overall , the global sfr density is less affected by our model imf than the most rapidly star - forming galaxies , since much of the global star formation occurs in modestly star - forming systems .",
    "our model imf goes some of the way towards alleviating the putative discrepancy between the integrated cosmic sfrd and the global stellar mass evolution , although current observations still disagree on the magnitude of the discrepancy .",
    "finally , we note that the rising cmb temperature with redshift sets an increasing minimum jeans mass that is non - negligible at large ( 3 ) redshifts",
    ". however , due to the rising sfr per galaxy with redshift , the average conditions are already warm enough due to gas - dust coupling that the effect of the cmb is negligible . as an example , at 4 , the cmb temperature is @xmath138 k. the mean sfr per galaxy is @xmath139 , which corresponds to a typical gas temperature of @xmath140 k ( see e.g. figure  [ figure : mjevolution ] ) .",
    "probably the single greatest piece of evidence for an invariant imf is that no conclusive evidence for a varying imf has ever been seen , even when probing a fairly wide range of physical conditions and environments in star forming regions within the milky way and nearby galaxies . for this reason as well as others ,",
    "all arguments for a varying imf must be taken with a healthy degree of skepticism .",
    "the recent review by @xcite takes a rather critical view of observational claims of imf variations ; we refer the reader there for a fuller discussion .",
    "there are many theoretical studies that suggest that the imf should be essentially constant in most relevant regimes .",
    "@xcite present a model in which the temperature in typical star forming regions in gmcs is set by radiation feedback from accretion onto protostars . in this scenario",
    ", one can arrive at a characteristic stellar mass primarily via fundamental constants , with only weak scaling with the physical properties of the gmc .",
    "similar arguments were made by @xcite .",
    "this theory may explain the near constancy of the imf in normal star forming regions in the galaxy , and has the additional attractive aspect of explaining why stars form to massive enough scales to begin hydrogen fusion .",
    "on the other hand , there have been a number of recent claims that the imf varies with galaxy properties .",
    "it is now reasonably well established that the h@xmath141 to uv luminosity ratio varies systematically with luminosity  @xcite , sfr  @xcite and/or surface brightness  @xcite , in the sense that for fainter galaxies there is less h@xmath141 than expected given the uv luminosity . since h@xmath141 traces very high mass stars while uv traces moderately high - mass stars , one possible explanation is that smaller gmcs are unable to produce very high - mass stars . in this scenario , fainter systems with on average smaller",
    "gmcs would have an integrated galactic imf that is less top - heavy .",
    "this variation would work in the same direction as the imf variations considered in this paper ( i.e. more top - heavy / bottom - light in more rapidly star - forming systems ) , but for a different reason ; also , it is seen to operate down to very low sfrs ( and indeed it is most evident there ) , whereas our results suggest that imf variations based on the jeans mass conjecture have little impact at sfrs of the milky way or smaller .",
    "that said , numerous investigations recently have discussed other physical effects that could lead to the observed trends in h@xmath141/uv , such as the leakage of ionizing photons , stochasticity in the formation of the most massive stars @xcite , variable star formation histories @xcite , and extinction effects .",
    "similarly , studies investigating the production rate of ionising photons in stellar clusters @xcite , as well as outer galaxy discs @xcite find no evidence for a varying imf .",
    "hence while intriguing , h@xmath141/uv variations are not widely considered to be an unambiguous indication of a varying imf .",
    "early - type galaxies also show tantalizing hints for imf variations .",
    "@xcite observed the wing - ford absorption bands ( tracing stellar masses @xmath142 ) in nearby cluster elliptical galaxies , and found that they indicate a much larger population of low - mass stars than expected from a galactic imf , i.e. that the imf in these galaxies is bottom - heavy .",
    "@xcite did careful dynamical modeling of ellipticals from the atlas-3d sample , and showed that high - mass ellipticals tend to have such mass - to - light ( m / l ) ratios that they can only be explained by a bottom - heavy imf .",
    "they also found a strong trend of imf variation with m / l .",
    "these data argue for a bottom - heavy imf as opposed to a bottom - light one as considered in this paper , but a naive extrapolation of their trend with m / l suggests that rapidly star - forming systems may have a top - heavy / bottom - light imf .",
    "however , it is also expected that massive star - forming systems at high-@xmath56 should evolve into present - day passive ellipticals , and thus it is not immediately clear how to reconcile these differing imfs within a single galaxy evolution scenario . if , indeed , the imf is bottom - heavy in the progenitor galaxies of present - day ellipticals , then this likely rules out the model presented in this paper @xcite .",
    "if the imf is indeed invariant , then what of the cosmic star formation problems discussed throughout this work ? there are certainly solutions that do not require an imf - based solution .",
    "there are many well - documented systematic uncertainties associated with measuring sfrs and @xmath0 , particularly at high redshifts when only broad - band data is available  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it is not difficult to imagine that one or more of these could alleviate the apparent discrepancies  ( see a discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "there could also be failures in current modeling techniques or assumptions .",
    "for instance , the high ssfr of @xmath8 galaxies could owe to a strong inefficiency of star formation in earlier galaxies owing e.g. to lower metallicities  @xcite , resulting in an accumulated gas reservoir that fuels excess star formation at @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "this would not alleviate differences between the observed cosmic sfr and @xmath0 buildup , but perhaps those could be explained by other systematics ; for instance , if the bottom - heavy imf seen in early - type galaxies is real , the total cosmic stellar mass in this component may be underestimated .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that numerical uncertainties still abound in modeling galaxy formation : for instance , @xcite found that sfrs in ( @xmath120 ) galaxies modeled with the moving - mesh code  are @xmath143 greater than those modeled using the sph code . with all the various factor - of - two uncertainties in play ,",
    "it is difficult to argue strongly for imf variations as being the only viable solution to any given problem .    as discussed in ",
    "[ section : ks ] , a varying imf may bring the observed kennicutt - schmidt relation index down from @xmath76 to @xmath144 , in agreement with most models which suggest a star formation rate regulated by dynamical processes .",
    "however , as shown by @xcite , if the star formation rate is instead regulated by supernovae - driven turbulence in a medium where the vertical pressure is dominated by gas , then one would expect a ks index of @xmath76 . in this sense ,",
    "even the reduction of the observed ks index is not reason enough to require a variable imf .      in this work ,",
    "we make the assumption that the imf characteristic mass scales as the gmc jeans mass . here",
    "we discuss arguments in favor of and against this jeans mass conjecture .",

    "observations of the taurus star - forming region and orion nebula cluster provide some evidence of this effect @xcite .",
    "numerical calculations also suggest that the number of fragments that form in a gmc is related to the number of jeans masses available @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed via numerical simulation that warm gas comparable to what may be found in nuclear starbursts indeed forms a mass spectrum of collapsed objects with a @xmath146  , though the degree of fragmentation can depend on the exact form of the equation of state of the gas .",

    "@xcite asked , given cooling rates by molecular lines , and heating rates by dust - gas energy exchange in dense gas , how should @xmath15 scale with density ?",

    "scalings , this alone would lead to an increase in jeans mass of @xmath103 . in other words ,",
    "even with a relatively weak scaling of @xmath15 with density , the conditions inside nuclear starbursts are extreme enough to result in variations in the gmc physical properties as found in our models .    a more general argument against the conjecture that @xmath150 is that the choice for the density that sets the jeans mass is not obvious .",
    "in this work we sidestep this problem by considering only how @xmath151 scales with galaxy properties and assuming that @xmath150 without worrying about the constant of proportionality .",
    "however , using typical numbers from our simulations results in @xmath152 for the milky way ( figure  [ figure : mjvsfr ] ) , which is unsatisfyingly far from @xmath153 .",
    "@xcite assumes that the characteristic density is set by when the gas becomes thermally coupled to the dust , and argued against this scale being set by turbulent or magnetic pressure .",
    "but in @xcite and other recent models , the density where isothermality is broken is set instead by radiative feedback , and thus the imf characteristic mass is not directly related to the jeans mass .",
    "we note that even if the @xmath154 is set by radiative feedback , the interstellar radiation properties vary substantially among our various simulated galaxies , and hence there may still be some imf variations predicted in such a model . nonetheless , the physical origin of the imf characteristic mass remains uncertain , and it is by no means entirely clear that it is directly related to the typical gmc jeans mass .    in this paper we suggest that heating of  gas by young stars formed during rapid star formation may increase the jeans mass .",
    "other models find similar results , though via different heating mechanisms .",

    "this scenario is likely to be most relevant in rather extreme cases ( e.g. near an agn ) , and not necessarily representative of quiescently star - forming galaxies .",
    "overall , whether the stellar imf varies in space and/or time , and how remains an open question .",
    "strong imf variations are clearly disallowed by observations , but mild variations may still be accommodated within current constraints .",
    "the jeans mass conjecture is by no means unassailable , and the resulting mild variations in the imf are probably difficult to exclude given current data .",
    "we use hydrodynamic galaxy evolution simulations and sophisticated radiative transfer models to study how the imf might vary with galaxy properties , under the assumption that the imf characteristic mass scales with the  mass - weighted jeans mass in the ism .",
    "we find that such an assumption results in an typical jeans mass that varies mildly with star formation rate , roughly as @xmath156  sfr@xmath157 at star formation rates above that of the milky way . at sfrs",
    "comparable to and lower than that of the milky way , there is little variation in @xmath158 in our model because cosmic ray heating begins to dominate over dust heating , setting a temperature floor at @xmath159  k. while this variation is not strong , it is still substantial enough to impact the inferred properties of rapidly star - forming galaxies .",
    "we parameterise the implied imf variation by considering its impact on sfrs derived from bolometric luminosities .",
    "we find that the relation is well - fit by sfr@xmath160 , as opposed to a linear relationship between these quantities as for an invariant imf ( assuming that any agn contribution has been excluded ) .",
    "since all extragalactic sfr tracers attempt to measure @xmath161 , either directly in the infrared , via a dust - corrected uv continuum , or via nebular emission line measures , this would imply that their inferred sfrs should be lowered in more luminous ( i.e. more rapidly star - forming ) systems .",
    "for instance , in sub - millimetre galaxies that are the most bolometrically luminous systems in the universe , the inferred sfrs would be up to a factor of five lower than implied by canonical conversion factors .",
    "large , rapidly star - forming disks at high redshifts would have their inferred sfr lowered by a factor of two .",
    "we study the impact of such an imf variation on a variety of galaxy properties across cosmic time .",
    "these include the star formation law , the sfr@xmath162 relation ( i.e. the galaxy main sequence ) , sub - millimetre galaxies , and the evolution of the cosmic sfr density . in each case , previous work has highlighted tantalizing albeit inconclusive evidence for discrepancies between models and data , or between star formation rate and stellar mass data . the discrepancies ( if real ) all point in the same direction , in the sense that the sfr inferred from high - mass tracers seems to exceed the observed growth in stellar mass by @xmath163 during the peak epoch of cosmic star formation . in each case , the varying imf based on the jeans mass conjecture tends to go towards reconciling the possible discrepancies .",
    "we caution that there is no smoking gun evidence for imf variations , and there are numerous ways these discrepancies may be alleviated without varying the imf .",
    "nonetheless , it is interesting that the ansatz of @xmath150 makes measurably different predictions for the evolution of galaxies across cosmic time in a manner that , at face value , tends to reconcile any possible discrepancies .",
    "we remain agnostic on the validity of our underlying assumption , namely the jeans mass conjecture , and we do not assert that imf variations are the only solution to the problems discussed here . rather , this paper merely explores the ansatz that @xmath150 , and then examines its effects on the star formation rates across cosmic time . as we discussed in  [ section : discussion ] , current models for the origin of the imf characteristic mass are mixed on whether this assumption is correct ; a recent class of successful models argues that  is set by radiative feedback in the ism , not .",
    "we leave further explorations along these lines to a different class of models that focus on the origin of the imf .",
    "additionally , such an evolving imf would have a wider range of impacts than explored here , owing to differences in e.g. stellar mass return , metallicity , and population synthesis that have not been fully accounted for here .",
    "also , at a constant ism density , the rising cmb temperature will force increasingly higher jeans masses with redshift , further complicating matters . investigating these effects",
    "would require running simulations that self - consistently model all these processes during their evolution , which is something we leave for the future .",
    "the authors thank mark krumholz for comments on an early version of this draft , and charlie conroy , emanuele daddi , dusan keres , naveen reddy and youngmin seo for helpful conversations .",

    "it is conceivable that one could consider the density term in the jeans mass equation as the median density ( i.e.the density above which half the mass resides ) , rather than the mean density . as a reminder , while we resolve the surfaces of gmcs , we do not resolve their internal structure .",
    "we assume that our gmcs have a lognormal density distribution . in this case",
    ", the median density can be expressed in terms of the width of the lognormal , @xmath164 : @xmath165 where @xmath166 is the mean density of the gmc .",
    "numerical experiments suggest that @xmath167 , where @xmath168 is the one - dimensional mach number @xcite .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite . ] in figure  [ figure : appendix ] , we show the relationship between sfr and @xmath15 when the jeans mass is calculated using @xmath169 instead of @xmath166 .",
    "the relation between @xmath15 and sfr in figure  [ figure : appendix ] is relatively tight .",
    "when comparing to figure  [ figure : mjvsfr ] , we see that the scatter is greatly reduced when considering a jeans mass calculated with the @xmath169 , rather than @xmath166 . in figure",
    "[ figure : mjvsfr ] , the bulk of the scatter arises from relatively active systems . for example , at a sfr of 50 , the galaxies with the highest average jeans mass in figure  [ figure : mjvsfr ] are ongoing mergers with warm isms , whereas the galaxies with lower jeans masses are either mergers during a more quiescent phase , or discs . using the median density",
    "rather always results in a jeans mass that is lower than when using the mean density , due to the extra term that scales with @xmath170 .",
    "because mergers and heavily star - forming discs tend to have high - velocity dispersion gas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , their jeans masses are reduced substantially when using @xmath169 .",
    "this tightens the dispersion dramatically in the range sfr=@xmath171 .",
    "one consequence of using @xmath169 rather than @xmath166 is that a significant increase in the characteristic mass of the imf is only seen in heavily star - forming galaxies ( sfr @xmath172 ) .",
    "this suggests that such a variation may only be seen during short - lived phases in local mergers , or in more heavily star - forming galaxies at high redshift .",
    "the results of this paper change little when utilising @xmath169 rather than @xmath166 in the jeans mass calculation .",
    "the normalisation of the @xmath15-sfr relation in figure  [ figure : appendix ] decreases , while the exponent increases slightly .",
    "these effects cause the normalisation of equation  [ eq : sfrlir ] to decrease by a factor of @xmath76 , while the exponent decreases to @xmath173 .                        , a.  d. , leroy , a.  k. , jameson , k. , ostriker , e. , gordon , k. , lawton , b. , stanimirovi , s. , israel , f.  p. , madden , s.  c. , hony , s. , sandstrom , k.  m. , bot , c. , rubio , m. , winkler , p.  f. , roman - duval , j. , van loon , j.  t. , oliveira , j.  m. , & indebetouw , r. 2011 , , 741 , 12                      , m. , mcdermid , r.  m. , alatalo , k. , blitz , l. , bois , m. , bournaud , f. , bureau , m. , crocker , a.  f. , davies , r.  l. , davis , t.  a. , de zeeuw , p.  t. , duc , p .- a . , emsellem , e. , khochfar , s. , krajnovic , d. , kuntschner , h. , lablanche , p .- y . ,",
