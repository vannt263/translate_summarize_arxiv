    "by the mid-1980 s the phenomenon of counterrotation had been observed in a significant number of elliptical and lenticular galaxies ( see the recent review by bertola & corsini 1998 ) .",
    "only more recently the presence of gaseous and/or stellar discs counterrotating with respect to the main stellar body has been discovered in some early - type spirals .",

    "this discovery poses new questions for the formation of disc galaxies .",
    "it is almost impossible for an isolated galaxy to generate an internal counterrotating component . in the general case",
    ", it is necessary to assume that the galaxy has acquired material from outside .",
    "the infall of external gas and the merging with gas - rich dwarf companions have been recently investigated by means of numerical simulations ( thakar & ryden 1996 ; thakar et al .",
    "1997 ) as possible mechanisms for producing massive counterrotating gaseous discs in spirals .",
    "the presence of stellar counterrotation is usually interpreted as the end result of an initial counterrotation of gas . but",
    "gas acquisition in spirals , more than in elliptical or in s0 galaxies , raises the problem of the interaction between the accreted counterrotating and the pre - existing corotating gas ( e.g. , lovelace & chou 1996 ) .",
    "recently some attempts have been made to explain special cases of stellar counterrotation as due to a self induced phenomenon in non - axisymmetric potentials ( evans & collett 1994 ; athanassoula 1996 ; wozniak & pfenniger 1997 ) .",

    "the continuum - band images were taken through an interference filter ( @xmath63 nm ; @xmath64 nm ) , which has been selected to observe an emission - free spectral region sufficiently near to that of the emission - band filter in order to subtract off the stellar continuum in the emission - band images .",

    "the derived value of the ring inclination is in agreement within the errors with the galaxy inclination of 67derived by rubin et al .",
    "( 1985 ) from the disc parameters .",
    "the position of the two maxima in the radial flux profiles of the all the measured emission lines corresponds to the radii at which the ring intersects the line of the nodes .    we have obtained the photometric and spectroscopic evidence for the existence in ngc  3593 of a circumnuclear ring of ionized gas .",
    "it is associated with molecular gas , which is also distributed in a nuclear ring - like configuration as discovered by wiklind & henkel ( 1992 ) .",
    "the centre of the co ring coincides with the galaxy kinematical center and its radius ( @xmath99 ) is located at the turning point of the ionized gas rotation curve .    in the past years , hunter et al .",
    "( 1989 ) were not able to distinguish between a small gaseous disc and a possibly ring - like structure due to the lower resolution of their  image .",
    "pogge & eskridge ( 1993 ) derived the same overall morphology and suggested the presence of the ring .",
    "the extent of the @xmath0  emitting region is about @xmath100 , as deduced from their published plate . in this image",
    "the diffuse emission surrounding the structure of the ring is not visible .",
    "they measured for the  ring the same major - axis position angle ( @xmath95@xmath101 ) and a smaller diameter ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "this difference is probably due to the clumpy morphology of the ionized gas emission .",
    "no estimate of the ring ellipticity ( or inclination ) is given .",
    "as it appears from the kinematics along the major axis of ngc  3593 ( bertola et al .",
    "1996 ) the ionized gas ring corotates with the gaseous and the secondary stellar discs and counterrotates with respect to the primary stellar disc . from wiklind & henkel ( 1992 )",
    "we derive that the ionized and the molecular gas components corotate .    the  luminosity can be used to estimate the current star formation rate ( sfr ) of ngc  3593 . following the sfr relation by kennicutt ( 1983 ) we find for ngc  3593 a sfr@xmath103 ( total)@xmath104 .",
    "this value is about one tenth of the sfr derived from the far infrared ( fir ) luminosity by wiklind & henkel ( 1992 ) .",
    "indeed it is sfr@xmath105 ( total)@xmath106 . the observed  flux is about @xmath107 of the value needed to make the sfr derived from the  luminosity comparable to that from the fir luminosity .",
    "it means that ngc  3593 is not a transparent system .",
    "in fact ngc  3593 is a dust - rich system as one can also infer by a comparison of its dust - to-  gas mass ratio with the mean values found by bregman et al .",
    "( 1992 ) for the early - type disc galaxies investigated by roberts et al .",
    "( 1991 ) .",
    "we can estimate the mean past sfr from the mass and the age of the stellar disc .",

    "( 1994 ) , but using our determination of the mass of stellar disc , we find @xmath108 ( past ) @xmath109 . for ngc  3593 the birthrate parameter @xmath110 calculated as the ratio of current sfr ( from fir luminosity ) to average past sfr is @xmath111 . for comparison , kennicutt et al .",
    "( 1994 ) found that this value for a sample of 18 non - interacting and/or peculiar sa s ranges from 0.01 to 0.1 ( with @xmath112 ) .",
    "so the central part of ngc  3593 is characterized by a value of @xmath110 which is high compared to the majority of early - type spirals .",
    "the current sfr is slightly higher than the sfr in the recent past .",
    "given the uncertainty in estimation of the sfr the only tenable conclusion is that it has been approximately constant .",
    "the total ionized gas mass can be derived from the  luminosity under the assumption of case b recombination ( see osterbrock 1989 ) . for a given electron temperature and density ,",
    "the  mass can be written : @xmath113 where  is the  luminosity , @xmath114 is the mass of the hydrogen atom , @xmath115 is the  emissivity , and @xmath116 and @xmath117 are the electron and the proton densities .",
    "the term @xmath118 is insensitive to changes of @xmath116 over the range @xmath119@xmath120 @xmath121 .",
    "it decreases by a factor 3 for changes of @xmath122 over the range @xmath123k@xmath124k ( osterbrock 1989 ) .",
    "for an assumed temperature @xmath125k , the electron density can be estimated to be @xmath126 @xmath121 from the measured  lines ratio .",
    "it results @xmath127  for the observed  and a value ten times larger for the  corrected for extinction .",
    "the presence of a counterrotating star - forming  ring in the nuclear regions of a galaxy was found for the first time in ngc  4138 ( jore et al . 1996 ) .",
    "the discovery of the same feature in ngc  3593 is notable , as the two galaxies are very similar .",
    "they are both early - type spirals with a small bulge and an apparently undisturbed morphology apart from the dust lanes crossing their stellar components .",
    "but they each have two counterrotating stellar discs with the more massive one containing about the @xmath128 of the stars . in both galaxies a gaseous disc is present and it rotates in the same direction as the less massive stellar disc . in the two objects the total counterrotating mass amounts to about the @xmath129 of their luminous mass .    the ring in ngc  3593 gives further significance to the numerical results of thakar et al .",
    "( 1997 ) for ngc  4138 .",
    "they adopted a two - component galaxy model with a stellar gas - free exponential disc and a truncated spherical isothermal halo to investigate the origin of the massive counterrotating component . in one of their simulations , namely i6",
    ", they placed in the stellar disc a prograde ring of gas .",
    "in this case the observed counterrotating  ring is the relic of the collisions between the infalling retrograde gas clouds and the pre - existing but less massive prograde gas .",
    "such collisions could have triggered the local enhancement of the stellar formation rate in the region of the ring .",
    "the same scenario can be applied to the case of ngc  3593 .",

    "the ionized gas rotates in the same direction as the primary stellar disc ( merrifield & kuijken 1994 ) .",
    "the presence of three gaseous rings has suggested to athanassoula ( 1996 ) an internal origin for its stellar counterrotation as due to the decay of a bar . in this sense gaseous rings in this kind of objects could be useful to understand if the origin of counterrotation is external or internal . in the case of an external origin a gaseous ring could be considered as the signature of the presence of an original amount corotating gas .",

    "<S> we present the results of narrow - band @xmath0  imaging of the early - type spiral ngc  3593 in combination with a study of the flux radial profiles of the  ( @xmath1 654.80 , 658.34 nm ) , , and  ( @xmath1 671.65 , 673.08 nm ) emission lines along its major axis . the galaxy is known to contain two counterrotating stellar discs of different size and luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the  emission mainly derives from a small central region of 57@xmath225 . </S>",
    "<S> it consists of a filamentary pattern with a central ring . </S>",
    "<S> this has a diameter of about 17(@xmath3 kpc ) and it contributes about half of the total  flux . </S>",
    "<S> the ring is interpreted as the result of the interaction between the acquired retrograde gas which later formed the smaller counterrotating stellar disc and the pre - existing prograde gas of the galaxy . </S>"
