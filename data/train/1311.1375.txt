    "linear systems and signals theory has been very useful in the analysis and engineering of dynamical systems .",
    "many fundamental notions have been proposed to characterize dynamical systems from a control - theoretic point of view .",

    "reveals the internal structure of a linear system .",
    "this , in particular minimal realization as a very convenient and yet quite natural assumption , is the basis of widely used model reduction methods such as balanced truncation and optimal hankel norm approximation .",
    "moreover , fundamental dissipation theory has been well established and has been proven very effective in control systems design .",
    "all of these have been well documented , see , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite .    in recent years",
    "there has been a rapid growth in the study of quantum linear systems .",
    "quantum linear systems and signals theory has been proven very effective in the study of many quantum systems including quantum optical systems , opto - mechanical systems , cavity quantum electro - magnetic dynamical systems , atomic ensembles and quantum memories , see , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite . because of its analytical and computational advantages , the linear setting always serves as an essential starting point for development of a more general theory .    controllability and observability of quantum linear passive systems have been discussed in @xcite ; these two properties are used to establish the complex - domain bounded real lemma ( ) for quantum linear passive systems , which is the basis of quantum @xmath2 coherent feedback control of quantum linear passive systems , @xcite . for a quantum linear passive system",
    "it is shown in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 3.1 ) that controllability is equivalent to observability ; moreover , a minimal realization is necessarily hurwitz stable , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 3.2 ) . in this paper",
    "we explore further controllability and observability of quantum linear systems . for general quantum linear systems ( not necessarily passive ) , we show that controllability and observability are equivalent ( proposition [ prop : minimal_c_omega ] ) .",
    "moreover , a simple matrix rank condition is established for checking controllability and observability .",
    "base on this result , a realization of general quantum linear systems is proposed , in which the uncontrollable and unobservable subspace is identified ( theorem [ thm : df ] ) .",
    "theorem [ thm : df ] can be viewed as the complex - domain counterpart of theorem 3.1 in @xcite in the real domain .",
    "however , it is can be easily seen from the proof of lemma [ lem : ctrb_obsv ] that the structure of the unitary transformation involved is better revealed in the complex domain .",
    "restricted to the passive case , we show that controllability , observability and hurwitz stability are equivalent to each other ( lemma [ thm : stab_obsr_cont ] ) .",
    "thus , the realization of a quantum linear passive system is minimal if and only if it is hurwitz stable ( theorem [ thm : minimal_hurwitz ] ) .",

    "the synthesis problem of quantum linear systems has been investigated in @xcite , where they showed that a quantum linear system can always be realized by a cascade of one - degree - of - freedom harmonic oscillators with possible direct hamiltonian couplings among them if necessary .",
    "then in @xcite a necessary and sufficient condition is derived for the realizability of quantum linear systems via pure cascading only . for the passive case , it is shown in @xcite",
    "that , under certain conditions on the system matrices , a minimal quantum linear passive system can be realized by a cascade of one - degree - of - freedom harmonic oscillators .",
    "these restrictions were removed in @xcite which proves that all quantum linear passive systems can be realised by pure cascading of one - degree - of - freedom harmonic oscillators .",
    "model reduction of quantum linear systems has been studied in , e.g. , @xcite , and @xcite . in this paper",
    "we propose several realizations of quantum linear passive systems .",
    "for the multi - input - multi - output ( mimo ) case we show that the proposed realization has a close relationship with controllability and observably of the quantum linear passive system ( theorem [ thm : mimo ] ) . in the single - input - single - output ( siso ) case , we propose two realizations , namely the independent - oscillator realization and the chain - mode realization ( theorem [ prop : independent_oscillator ] and theorem [ lem : continued_fraction ] ) , and finally we show that if the system is hurwitz stable , these two realizations are related to the lossless positive real @xmath1 mentioned in the previous paragraph ( theorem [ thm : independent_mode_unique ] ) .",
