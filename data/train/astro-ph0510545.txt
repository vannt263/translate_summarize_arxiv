    "very little is known about short time scale ( @xmath2 day ) variability of stars in the magellanic clouds . only recently",
    ", the availability of large telescopes located at excellent sites has made it possible to consider time - domain monitoring of the stellar population at brightness levels reaching and beyond the levels of the turn - off point of the oldest stellar population in lmc at @xmath3 .",
    "the current study addresses the detection and characterization of contact binary stars in a typical lmc field 1.7 degrees from the center of the lmc .",
    "this field was selected taking guidance from an hst study of the stellar population in the lmc @xcite , where it was called disk-1 .",
    "availability of the archival hst images was one of the reasons for this study as it permitted us to check for stellar blends and assure better consistency of our results .",
    "the field is characterized by a constant star formation rate from the advanced age of 7.5 to 15 gyr until recently . in a companion study on short time - scale variability in the lmc @xcite , the studied field was dominated by a population of the open cluster lw55 with an age of about 1.5 gyr , in the presence of an underlying older population with an age about 4 gyr or more .",
    "we did not find any short - period binaries in or around lw55 , but only several short - period pulsating stars instead .",
    "we present the observations and show the color  magnitude diagram for stars in the field in section  [ obs ] .",
    "the results of the search for short - period variable stars are given in section  [ var ] .",
    "section  [ concl ] concludes the paper and summarizes the results .",
    "we used the magellan / baade 6.5 m telescope with the tek5 ccd @xmath4 camera which had a focal scale of 0.069 arcsec / pixel .",
    "the field of view was @xmath5 arcsec square .",
    "the images were binned by 2 pixels in both directions before extraction of photometry , with the resulting scale of 0.138 arcsec / pixel .",
    "the median seeing during our run was 0.94 arcsec in the @xmath6 filter and 1.09 arcsec in the @xmath7 filter .",
    "the binned images significantly oversampled the point spread function ( psf ) even in the cases of the best seeing .",
    "the search for variability was done mainly with the @xmath6 filter ( 47 images ) but also with the @xmath7 filter ( 12 images ) .",
    "all @xmath6-filter exposures were 600  s while all @xmath7-filter ones were 900  s.    the observations were made on two nights , 2002 january 4/5 and 5/6 .",
    "we conducted 6.2 hours of variability monitoring on the first night and 7.3 hours on the second night .",
    "the nights can be characterized as gray time , with the fraction of the illuminated area of the moon disc of 61% and 50% , respectively .",
    "the image processing was identical to that described in @xcite .",
    "the initial processing of the images was done with standard procedures from iraf with a combination of the dome and sky flats used for the ccd response flat - field corrections .",
    "the astrometric calibration was based on 48 reference stars from the usno - b catalogue @xcite .",
    "the random errors for the calibration do not exceed 0.5 arcsec , based on the recovered coordinates of the usno - b stars .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the sky image in the pixel space ( after the @xmath8 binning ) , with pixels 0.138 arcsec in size and with a total field of view of @xmath9 arcmin square .",
    "the field in figure  [ fig1 ] is oriented with east to left and north down .",
    "the @xmath10-coordinate runs w to e , while the @xmath11-coordinate runs n to s.      the photometric calibrations were done using three of stetson s standard star fields @xcite : 2 stars in ngc  1866 , 6 stars in e4108 and 15 stars in ngc  2682 ( m67 ) .",
    "the fields were observed with air masses ranging from 1.13 to 1.77 .",
    "the extinction coefficients as well as the color terms and zero points of the transformations from the instrumental to the standard @xmath12 system were determined from observations of all 23 standards stars .",
    "the adopted formulae were : @xmath13    @xmath10 is an air - mass and lower - case symbols denote instrumental magnitudes derived with the aperture photometry with the daophot program @xcite .",

    "the reference frames in @xmath6 and @xmath7 were obtained by collation of , respectively , 10 and 7 individual frames with the best seeing , in the way as described in detail in @xcite .",
    "the seeing in the reference images had fwhm of 0.62 arcsec in @xmath6 and 0.74 arcsec in @xmath7 .",
    "the quoted errors in table  [ tab1 ] do not reflect stellar variability but are just the internal errors of the psf photometry on the reference images .",
    "it is difficult to assess reliably errors of single - frame profile photometry in a crowded field such as disk-1 .",
    "some formal errors , such as those returned by the daophot software , are often too optimistic as they tend to miss problems related to blending .",
    "we were not able to compare directly our results with those of @xcite which were discussed only in graphical and verbal form .",
    "however , we have analyzed the archival hst  wfpc2 data : @xmath6 : 2 @xmath15 500s , f555w , # u4b10905r and # u4b10906r ; @xmath16 : 2 @xmath15 300s , f814w , # u4b10902r and # u4b10904r ; the pairs of images were used to remove cosmic rays .",
    "we estimated deviations between our photometry and the hst photometry , the latter obtained using the `` hstphot '' software package @xcite . while no obvious trends exist in the @xmath6 magnitude differences for 963 common stars in the range @xmath17 , there does exist an offset of @xmath18 ( our results brighter ) .",
    "this offset has not been applied to the photometric results listed in tables  [ tab1 ] and the variable stars ( section  [ var ] ) .",
    "we note that systematic uncertainties in the wfpc2 photometry are estimated at about 0.05 mag . , and may even reach 0.1 mag . @xcite .",
    "to estimate random uncertainties , we compared our results with the hst results for individual stars .",
    "the deviations for the sample of 963 common stars are shown in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "after accounting for the systematic shift of @xmath19 , binning the deviations in one magnitude intervals , and with an assumption that errors from both sources add quadratically , we estimate the @xmath20 scatter at @xmath21 for for @xmath22 ; it increases to 0.09 at @xmath23 and to 0.11 at @xmath24 .",
    "much more reliable than the above estimates are estimates of errors in the search for variable stars , obtained by comparison a large number of images analyzed using the image differencing technique .",
    "they are discussed in section  [ var ] in a discussion of amplitudes of detectable variable stars .",
    "the photometric results for the whole field are plotted on the color  magnitude diagram ( cmd ) in figure  [ fig4 ] . as discussed by @xcite ,",
    "the disk-1 field contains populations of different age with clear indications that the star formation rate in this part of the lmc was constant over a long time .",
    "we can see the red horizontal branch ( at about @xmath25 ) and the main sequence turn - off point ( at about @xmath26 ) of the old population as well as a sequence of young stars extending to @xmath27 .",
    "a search for potential variable stars in the field disk-1 was performed with the image subtraction package isis v2.1 @xcite .",
    "two methods were used to detect potential variable objects .",
    "first , we applied procedures which are included in the isis package and which are based on analysis of residual images .",
    "the second method relies on extraction  still within the isis package  of light curves for all stellar objects whose positions had been determined on template images with daophot / allstar @xcite .",
    "extracted light curves are subsequently examined for the presence of any possible periodic variations with a suite of programs based on the `` aov '' algorithm @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows the @xmath20 versus the magnitude diagram for 6243 stars whose light curves were analyzed ( this number is by about one half larger than the number of stars that went into the cmd ) .",
    "the @xmath20 errors were derived after rejection of the two most extreme maximal and minimal data points from data for each star .",
    "not all points with large @xmath28 in the figure correspond to physical variables as automatic processing led to inclusion of a few easily identifiable stars with poor photometry , mostly in the extended wings of over - exposed bright stars .",
    "the figure suggests that assuming a @xmath29 detection threshold , we should be able to detect variable stars with peak - to - peak amplitudes of @xmath30 at @xmath31 and @xmath32 at @xmath33 .",
    "it is encouraging to note that the data were taken during gray time . clearly , even during gray time , one may use the baade telescope to look for variable stars in the lmc beyond the turnoff region at @xmath34 .",
    "we have detected six variable stars in the disk-1 field .",
    "they are marked on the color - magnitude diagram of the field in figure  [ fig4 ] and are listed in table  [ tab2 ] , where their cmd numbers , @xmath35 and equatorial j2000 coordinates , the maximum and minimum @xmath6 and median values of @xmath36 are given .",
    "the listed values of @xmath36 are uncertain because of the non - simultaneous nature of our @xmath7 and @xmath6 observations and because the exposure times were rather long ( 15 minutes in @xmath7 ) .",
    "the @xmath37 data given in table  [ tab2 ] are slightly different than the ones in table  [ tab1 ] due to stellar variability along with differences in how the mean photometric values were determined .",

    "although the light curve may suggest a close , but detached binary , @xmath44 predicted from @xmath45 and @xmath46 perfectly agrees with the contact - binary calibration of @xcite(see also @xcite ) , @xmath47 .",

    "the light curve is relatively well defined thanks to the folding of several periods . *",
    "v3(#1999 )  an interesting blue star well below the main sequence at @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( independent photometry on the reference image of section  [ cmd ] gives @xmath52 ) .",
    "variability is rapid ; if it is a binary , as individual nightly observations suggest , then the period is 0.2607 day , but the period may be actually 1/2 of this value .",
    "we verified that the blue color of the star is not due to blending , which is possible in such a crowded field as disk-1 because the archival wfpc2/hst images mentioned above clearly show that v3 is indeed very blue .",
    "the observed luminosity of v3 is consistent with a relatively bright cataclysmic variable in the lmc .",
    "the variable is isolated and bright enough that low - resolution spectra could be obtained from the ground .",

    "we assumed that two cycles elapsed between the two nights , p=0.538 d. since we have not captured the light maximum , we have been unable to determine the initial ( maximum light ) epoch @xmath53 for this star ; the maximum brightness is possibly above @xmath54 .",
    "because the light curve is incomplete , we can not relate photometric properties of the star to the horizontal branch of the lmc , but the properties are certainly consistent .",

    "we have photometrically observed a region of the large magellanic cloud  called `` disk-1 '' by @xcite  on two consecutive nights in search of short time scale variable stars . the time monitoring led to the discovery of four short - period eclipsing binaries and of two pulsating stars ( rrab and @xmath0  sct ) .",
    "the results clearly show that solar - type stars are accessible for such monitoring in the lmc down to @xmath65 .",
    "it appears to be significant that the field disk-1 contains short period binaries .",
    "we discovered four such binaries , in contrast to the results for the lmc field of lw55 @xcite which was observed in a practically identical way and where we detected only very low amplitude , pulsating variables of @xmath0  scuti , sx  phoenicis or @xmath66  doradus type , and no binaries .",
    "while small - number statistical fluctuation is still a possibility , the reason may be in the uniform distribution of stellar ages in the disk-1 field @xcite , contrasted with the population dominated by lw55 itself with an age of 1.5 gyr .",
    "obviously , the number of short - period binaries is still small , 4 among 6243 monitored including possibly 3 contact binaries , compared with the galactic field where typically one among 500 fgk dwarfs is expected to be a contact binary @xcite .",
    "however , all binaries detected by us have moderately large amplitudes , @xmath67 , which may result from selection effects operating at the faint levels of @xmath68 in a very crowded field ; we simply could not detect low amplitude binaries .",
    "numbers of close binaries apparently increase rapidly with decreasing amplitude of light variations @xcite .",
