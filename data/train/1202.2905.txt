    "[ fig : resultsgradient ] ( b ) . the band at @xmath5  1600  @xmath18 results from superposition of the g and the d modes .",
    "the g mode is a long wavelength optical phonon originating from in - plane bond - stretching motion of pairs of sp@xmath0 hybridized carbon atoms .",
    "the d mode is induced by disorder and requires intra - valley electron - phonon scattering .",
    "the d mode at @xmath5  1344  @xmath18 , which requires the presence of six - fold aromatic rings , is induced by disorder , such as edges or atomic defects .",

    "g ) , the g+d band slightly below @xmath5  3000  @xmath18 and a third one at @xmath5  3200  @xmath18 matching the energy of the g+d mode .",
    "we observe the latter , but it is not discernible in the color plot of fig .",

    "the intensity of all raman features decreases with decreasing gr ( film thickness ) , while the relative intensities of d and g bands vary with the gr : for higher gr ( upper part of fig .",

    "fig : resultsgradient ] ( b ) ) .",
    "in addition , at higher gr a significant raman intensity is observed between the g and d modes , which originates from the presence of disordered carbon bonds @xcite . at lower gr ( below the dashed line of fig . [",
    "fig : resultsgradient ] ) the peak intensity ratio @xmath19 greatly diminishes and the g and d bands become better resolved due to the raman intensity between those two modes decreasing drastically . both observations point to a larger crystal size and a higher crystal quality for lower growth rates .    the two raman spectra ( gr  =  1.08   / min ) , shown at the bottom of fig .",
    "[ fig : resultsgradient ] ( b ) , reveal that by changing the excitation laser wavelength from @xmath20  nm ( green trace ) to @xmath21  nm ( red trace ) there is a clear redshift in the positions of the d and 2d raman bands . in crystalline graphene layers , such a redshift arises from the wave - vector dispersion of the optical phonons .",
    "the size of the frequency shift that we observe is comparable to those reported for graphite and graphene @xcite .",
    "the observed energy dispersion of the mbg films provides further evidence of crystallinity .",
    "the two growth regions have the distinct nexafs signatures , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : resultsgradient ] ( c ) . in both regions",
    "we find spectral fingerprints of sp@xmath0-hybridized carbon @xcite : strong peaks at 285.4  ev and 292.0  ev that correspond to excitation of a carbon 1s core electron to the unoccupied @xmath22 and @xmath23 orbitals , respectively .",
    "the sharpness of the nexafs features indicates a well - defined bonding environment and long - range periodic order in the electronic structure .",
    "the @xmath23 fine structure , in particular , is specifically characteristic of graphite , and includes a sharp onset due to an excitonic core hole - valence state interaction and the broader @xmath23 peak at @xmath5  1 ev higher photon energy due to more delocalized @xmath23 states @xcite .",
    "thus , the nexafs spectra unequivocally prove the formation of sp@xmath0 bonds between carbon atoms in the mbg films .",
    "nexafs is also sensitive to substrate - relative bond - orientations @xcite .",
    "being governed by the transition dipole matrix element between a core electron and an unoccupied orbital above the fermi level , the nexafs intensity depends upon the angle between the electric field vector of the incoming x - ray beam and the molecular orbitals in the system ( see inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : poldepnexafs ] ) .",
    "hence , we directly probe the degree of bond anisotropy in the sp@xmath0 films by changing the angle of the incident x - ray beam from near parallel ( 20 ) to near perpendicular ( 70 ) to the substrate ; the e - field vector is perpendicular to the beam axis .    for higher gr ( upper half of fig .",
    "[ fig : resultsgradient ] ( c ) ) no angular dependence of the nexafs resonances is observed , indicating a fairly isotropic arrangement of sp@xmath0 bonds . in striking contrast",
    ", the nexafs intensity becomes strongly dependent on incident angle at lower gr ( lower half of fig .",
    "[ fig : resultsgradient ] ( c ) ) .",
    "the intensity of the @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) peak is at its maximum ( minimum ) at 20  and minimum ( maximum ) at 70   incidence , indicating highly oriented planar c = c bonds parallel to the substrate surface . here ,",
    "the sp@xmath0 carbon layers grow in a two - dimensional plane .",
    "the ability to grow sp@xmath0 carbon layers well aligned to the plane of the substrate , and the presence of two regions with distinctly different degrees of bond anisotropy is emphasized by the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : resultsgradient ] ( c ) , which plots the area of the @xmath22 peak as a function of the incident angle for the two regions .",
    "the homogeneity of the material throughout the volume can be probed with nexafs by varying a bias voltage applied to the sample . by changing the voltage from -250  v to -50  v ,",
    "the depth within the carbon film from which detected electrons are emitted can be tuned from about 1  nm to about 7  nm ( maximum film thickness @xmath24  nm ) .",
    "the higher voltage allows detection of electrons only from the near surface - region .",
    "since we do not observe a bias - dependency of the spectral features , we conclude that the films are homogenous throughout the volume .",
    "this excludes the possibility of initial formation of a planar film in the isotropic region of the films followed by accumulation of defects as the film thickness is increased .      and mica with cvd graphene , including the energy position and angular dependence of the nexafs features , is clearly observable .",
    "incident angles of 20   and 70   correspond roughly to out - of - plane and in - plane polarizations , as shown schematically in the inset.,width=340 ]    figure [ fig : poldepnexafs ] compares angle - dependent nexafs spectra for few - layer ( @xmath52  nm ) mbg graphene on sio@xmath3  and on mica , with a single high - quality graphene layer grown on cu foil by cvd .",
    "the nexafs spectra from the mbg and cvd grown graphene are very similar .",
    "in fact , aside from a slightly weaker angular dependence of the mbg films , the main difference between the mbg and cvd spectra is the intensity in - between the @xmath22 and the @xmath23 resonances , which is due to c - o and c - h bonds ( a resonance due to an interlayer state in few - layer graphene also appears in this region ) @xcite .",
    "this intensity between the @xmath22 and the @xmath23 resonances can be explained by the larger number of dangling bonds available at the grain boundary of the mbg nanocrystals , due to their smaller grain size compared to those in the cvd samples .",
    "these are readily saturated by oxygen and hydrogen bonds .",
    "these bonds tend to distort the planarity of graphene films and therefore may also explain the suppressed angular dependence of the nexafs data for the mbg films compared to cvd graphene .",
    "importantly , no features associated with sp@xmath2 carbon - carbon bonds are observed in the nexafs data .",
    "-@xmath22 resonance , a shift and broadening of the sp@xmath0-@xmath23 and a well pronounced peak at @xmath5  289  ev , which is associated with the @xmath23 resonance of sp@xmath2-carbon.,width=340 ]    to further investigate the impact of disorder , we compare nexafs data from a thick mbg film ( @xmath25  nm ) , both with that from glassy carbon ( used as carbon source ) and from highly - ordered pyrolytic graphite ( hopg ) .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nexfasthickstuff ] .",
    "while the nexafs spectrum of the mbg film is very similar to that of hopg , distinct differences are observed from the glassy - carbon spectrum , which has significant sp@xmath2 content .",
    "in particular , the sp@xmath26 and @xmath23 peaks are strongly suppressed and the sp@xmath27 peak is significantly broadened .",
    "an onset and a peak centered around 289 ev appears due to the sp@xmath28 absorption edge of diamond and a c - h resonance @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the thick mbg film and the hopg traces possess the spectral signatures of sp@xmath0 bonds , as already discussed .",
    "hopg has better long range periodic ordering , as is evidenced by the sharpness of the @xmath23 resonance . as in fig .",
    "[ fig : poldepnexafs ] , the mbg films show some c - h and c - o bonds at the grain boundaries of the nanocrystals , as well as non - uniform bonding between the differently oriented graphene nanocrystals in three dimensions , giving rise to the intensity between the sp@xmath27 and the @xmath22 resonances ( indicated by the arrow in fig . [",
    "fig : nexfasthickstuff ] ) .",
    "+ thus , the thick mbg films are indeed structurally very similar to hopg and consist of graphite nanocrystals .",
    "as expected for sp@xmath0 bonded carbon , the mbg films show electrical conductivity at room temperature .",
    "preliminary 4-probe transport measurements reveal a sheet resistivity of a few k@xmath29 ; sufficient conductivity for stm measurements .",
    "figure [ fig : stm ] ( a ) shows a 3-dimensional ambient stm topography of a mbg film on a mica substrate ( the size of the image is 44  nm@xmath0 ) .",

    "[ fig : ramandetails ] ( a ) and ( c ) is attributed to the unresolved superposition of the g and d raman modes @xcite . the raman intensity between the d and g band",
    "is tentatively interpreted as from disorder at the grain boundaries .",
    "in addition to the 2d ( g ) band at ( @xmath31 ) we also observe two second - order bands at higher raman shifts ( figs . [ fig : ramandetails ] ( b ) and ( d ) ) : g+d at @xmath5  2928  @xmath18 and g+d at @xmath5  3202  @xmath18 .",
    "these allow a calculation of the energy shifts of the g and d modes , which thereby are found to be at 1584  @xmath18 and 1618  @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "all these values are in very good agreement with previous reports for such graphene - like systems @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : ramandetails ] ( e ) shows results at lower grs : here the g mode redshifts to @xmath5  1585  @xmath18 , indicating that the contribution of the d band is reduced , most likely as a consequence of a larger nanocrystal size .",
    "in addition , the d - mode intensity is reduced relative to the g mode and the intensity between those two modes decreases .",
    "four lorentzians , corresponding to the three graphene optical phonon frequencies : d , g and d ; and a fourth one related to the 3to si phonon ( at 1450  @xmath18 ) , reproduce the data @xcite .    the intensity ratio i(d)/i(g ) , provides an estimate of the crystallite dimensions @xcite .",
    "the graph of figure [ fig : ramandetails ] ( f ) reveals an unambiguous trend : that the grain size increases up to 22  nm on reducing the gr .",
    "this result is consistent with the reduced raman intensity between the d and g lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : ramandetails ] ( e ) .",
    "these experimental findings , suggest a preliminary picture of how these mbg films are formed , which indicates that fundamentally different atomic arrangements are caused by variations in the growth rate .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that this phenomenological description is based not only on the samples presented here , but also on sets of samples grown at different maximum grs ( 2.3   / min to @xmath32   / min ) , various substrate temperatures ( 380  to 940 ) and different maximum film thicknesses ( @xmath33 3.3  nm to 15.6  nm as defined in eqn .",
    "1 ) .    after controlling for all the other variables in the growth",
    ", our main finding is that lower fluxes of carbon atoms create graphene layers that are more aligned with the substrate surface .",
    "this is clearly seen for example in figure 2 where the differing orientations are observable on the same sample .",
    "the upper region , being closer to the solid carbon source , is subject to a higher rate of incident carbon atoms .",
    "the nexafs and raman spectra from this upper region reveal isotropic orientations of the sp@xmath0-bonds .",
    "in the lower region , due to its increased distance from the carbon source , and thereby its lower growth rate , we find graphene multilayers which are aligned parallel to the substrate surface .",
    "the diversity of carbon chemistry implies that bonding between individual carbon atoms on a surface can proceed via several reaction pathways depending on the details of the environment . with so many reaction paths ,",
    "there are many opportunities for carbon bonding , which seems to occur very fast .",
    "thus , film growth can be understood as a dynamic process which strongly depends on the number of available carbon atoms that find themselves in close proximity within the time it takes to form a bond . in the limit of a large flux of atoms , each carbon atom has not enough time to find an energetically - optimized location before forming a covalent bond .",
    "this leads to the formation of bonds along random directions , resulting in small randomly - aligned graphene nanocrystals .",
    "this growth can be regarded as quasi-3d and has similarities to volmer - weber ( island ) growth .",
    "conversely , layered material can form , if the impinging carbon atoms have more time to find energetically - favored locations and bond on a larger graphene edge . for a given substrate temperature , this reduction in the number of available carbon atoms",
    "is realized by reducing the gr .",
    "this layered growth is strongly analogous to two - dimensional frank - van der merwe ( layer - by - layer ) growth , but further investigations are needed to confirm this .",
    "a roughness analysis reveals a smooth growth front , independent of the film thickness , for low grs , which is typical of the frank - van der merwe growth mode .",
    "increasing the substrate temperature might be expected to have a similar effect as the reduction of the gr due to a higher diffusion rate of the atoms on the surface . however , our findings show that growths at higher substrate temperatures result in sp@xmath2 bonds being present in the films .",
    "we speculate that a thermally - induced , chemical interaction of carbon atoms with the substrate is activating the sp@xmath2 formation .",
    "in addition , the diffusion of carbon atoms on the surface may be limited by roughness of the sio@xmath3  substrate .    in order to exclude the influence of film thickness ,",
    "we have also studied samples with films of different thicknesses that were grown by varying the carbon flux .",
    "the results are in agreement with the bias - dependent nexafs measurements discussed above ( section 3.1.2 ) .",
    "independent of the film thickness , high grs ( @xmath34   / min ) result in isotropic material ( 3d growth ) throughout the film volume , whereas low grs ( @xmath35   / min ) produce sp@xmath0 layered films parallel to the sample surface with a concomitant increase in the size of the graphene nanocrystals .",
    "we have investigated non - epitaxial growth of graphene on insulating substrates by using a molecular beam of carbon atoms and have explored , in particular , the growth rate required to obtain good quality , ultra - thin films by mbg .    using nexafs and raman spectroscopy",
    "we have shown that growth rate is a crucial parameter for two - dimensional ( layered ) growth of graphene crystals , as it strongly influences the alignment of the sp@xmath0-bonds .",
    "nexafs spectra for high growth rates reveal isotropic orientation of the sp@xmath0-bonds . this growth can be regarded as quasi-3d .",
    "on reducing the growth rate we concomitantly increase crystallite size to @xmath5  22  nm and align the graphene multilayer - crystals parallel to the substrate .",
    "the reduction of grain boundaries manifests as reduced raman scattering intensity between the d and g bands and anisotropy in the bond - orientations in angle - dependent nexafs measurements .",
    "typical mbg parameters ( growth rate , substrate temperature , surface mobility ) , and the mbg setup itself , offer a wide parameter space in which to explore the growth of a range of layered materials with van - der waals coupling between the layers . at the same time",

    "<S> we demonstrate the growth of graphene nanocrystals by molecular beam methods that employ a solid carbon source , and that can be used on a diverse class of large area dielectric substrates . </S>",
    "<S> characterization by raman and near edge x - ray absorption fine structure spectroscopies reveal a sp@xmath0 hybridized hexagonal carbon lattice in the nanocrystals . </S>",
    "<S> lower growth rates ( below 0.5  / min ) favor the formation of layered , larger size multi - layer graphene crystallites ( up to 22  nm ) on all investigated substrates . </S>",
    "<S> the surface morphology is determined by the roughness of the underlying substrate ( rms @xmath1   ) and graphitic monolayer steps are observed by ambient scanning tunneling microscopy . </S>"
