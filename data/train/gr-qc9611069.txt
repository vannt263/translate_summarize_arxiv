    "the classical and strongest version of the `` no  hair '' conjecture establishes that a stationary black hole is uniquely described by global charges , i.e. , conserved charges associated with massless gauge fields , expressed by surface integrals at the spatial infinity @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "in particular , the conjecture excludes the existence of massive fields in the domain of outer communications @xmath1 of a stationary black hole .",
    "this fact rests on the idea that in the black hole transition to stationarity `` everything that can be radiated away will be radiated away '' ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , so , the only classical degrees of freedom of a stationary black hole are those corresponding to non  radiative multipole moments ; massive fields are automatically excluded because all their multipoles are radiative @xcite .    the absence of massive `` hair '' was shown early in the bekenstein pioneering works for massive scalar fields , proca  massive spin1 fields , and massive spin2 fields @xcite . an alternative demonstration for proca fields",
    "can be found in @xcite . the `` no  hair '' theorem for massive vector fields is a useful tool for excluding the existence of new black hole solutions for very complicated theories as metric ",
    "affine gravity , where a relevant sector of this theory reduces to an effective einstein  proca system @xcite .",
    "it is well  known that fields acquire mass not only kinematically , as in the previous cases , but also through a dynamical mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking . this is the case of spontaneously broken abelian models describing a charged scalar field with a self  interaction having nonzero vacuum expectation values , and minimally coupled to a massless abelian gauge field .",
    "the `` no  hair '' conjecture for these models has been previously enunciated as @xcite : _ any stationary black hole solution , such that all gauge  invariant observables are non  singular , must have a vanishing electromagnetic field , in the domain of outer communications @xmath2 of the black hole_. the simplest of this systems is the abelian higgs model ( mexican  hat self ",
    "interaction ) for which a `` no  hair '' theorem was shown in @xcite , proving the vanishing of the gauge field for spherically symmetric static black holes .",
    "this proof has been considered unsatisfactory @xcite because it is based on an inconsistent gauge choice .",
    "improved versions have been recently given @xcite , without the original restrictions criticized in @xcite .",
    "the subject of this paper is twofold , first , to relax the spherically symmetric assumption in the previously quoted contributions , by working with general static asymptotically flat systems , and second , to extent the `` no  hair '' theorem to more general abelian models than the higgs model , i.e. , for general spontaneously broken self  interactions .",
    "emphasis is given on asymptotically flat black holes only , this way we exclude from consideration black holes pierced by a cosmic string @xcite with the corresponding nontrivial behavior of the abelian field , as it has been previously pointed by bekenstein @xcite , these last configurations are not asymptotically flat since they present the angular deficit inherent to the presence of topological defects .",
    "the basic difference between these configurations is that for the string  pierced black holes the scalar field satisfy boundary conditions at infinity in accordance with the existence of a topological defect , i.e. , the scalar field is confined to the vacuum only in a circle at infinity , which implies the developing of a cosmic string at the interior of the circle , whereas for asymptotically flat black holes the scalar field approaches the vacuum in all directions at infinity . for a static black hole ,",
    "the killing field @xmath3 coincides with the null generator of the event horizon @xmath4 and is timelike and hypersurface orthogonal in all the domain of outer communications @xmath5 .",
    "this allow us to choose , by simply connectedness of @xmath1 @xcite , a global coordinate system @xmath6 , @xmath7 , in all @xmath2 @xcite , such that @xmath8 and the metric reads @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are @xmath12independent , @xmath11 is positive definite in all @xmath13 , and @xmath10 is positive in all @xmath13 and vanishes in @xmath4 . from (",

    "we would like to emphasize that the reissner  nordstrm black hole is not a solution of the above equations ; the system we are dealing with is an abelian higgs model , i.e. , a charged ( @xmath33 ) scalar field minimally coupled to an abelian gauge field , and with a self  interaction having nonvanishing vacuum expectation values .",
    "the coupling of this system to gravity ( [ eq : ein])([eq : scalar ] ) , does not reduce in no one case to the einstein ",
    "maxwell system , and therefore , it does not contain the reissner ",

    "this becomes apparent from the lagrangian ( [ eq : l ] ) : for constant values of the charged scalar field , @xmath34 , a mass term , @xmath35 , arises , this is due to the spontaneously broken behavior of the self  interaction , which requires @xmath36 . in this case",
    ", we lost asymptotic flatness and , consequently , the reissner  nordstrm black hole can not be a solution of the resulting system .",
    "other is the situation when there is no spontaneously symmetry breaking , i.e. , @xmath37 , in this case the model reduces to the einstein ",
    "maxwell system for vanishing scalar field and the existence of the reissner ",
    "nordstrm black hole is assured , but this is not the case we will dealt with in the paper .    we shall assume that the gauge field shares the same symmetries of the metric , namely , it is stationary , @xmath38 . consequently with a ( metric)static configuration ( [ eq : static ] ) , we will also assume the existence of electromagnetic staticity , i.e. , the maxwell field @xmath39 and the maxwell equations ( [ eq : max ] ) are invariant under time  reversal transformations . the time ",
    "reversal invariance of maxwell equations ( [ eq : max ] ) requires that , in the coordinates chosen in ( [ eq : static ] ) , @xmath40 and @xmath41 remain unchanged while @xmath42 and @xmath43 change sign , or the opposite scheme , i.e. , @xmath40 and @xmath41 change sign as long as @xmath42 and @xmath43 remain unchanged under time reversal @xcite .",
    "however , this isometry should not change gauge ",
    "invariant observables , therefore @xmath42 and @xmath43 must vanish in the first case , while @xmath40 and @xmath41 vanish in the second one .",
    "hence , staticity on the metric and material sources implies the existence of two nonoverlapping cases : a purely electric case ( i ) and a purely magnetic case ( ii ) .",
    "now we are ready to proof the `` no  hair '' statement for the gauge field , i.e. , for spontaneously broken abelian model the electromagnetic field vanishes in the domain of outer communications @xmath1 of a static asymptotically flat black hole .",
    "let @xmath44 be the open region bounded by the spacelike hypersurface @xmath45 , the spacelike hypersurface @xmath46 , and pertinent portions of the horizon @xmath47 , and the spatial infinity @xmath48 .",

    "@xmath48 the scalar field modulus @xmath55 approaches to one of the nonvanishing values , @xmath25 , minimizing the potential function @xmath24 , which implies ( see the lagrangian ( [ eq : lp ] ) ) that the gauge field behaves as an effective massive field at spatial infinity @xmath48 , due to the spontaneous breaking of the gauge symmetry at this region .",
    "the usual yukawa fall  off of massive fields at infinity cause the boundary integral over @xmath56 vanishes @xcite . for the remaining boundary integral at the portion of the horizon",

    "can be rewritten as @xmath64 in order to demonstrate that the last integrand vanishes it is sufficient to prove that the quantities appearing at the right hand side of ( [ eq : integ ] ) are such that : @xmath65 vanishes and @xmath66 remains bounded at the horizon .",
    "we shall establish the behavior of these quantities at the horizon by studying some invariants constructed from the curvature . by using einstein equations ( [ eq : ein ] ) ,",
    "we obtain the following two equivalent expressions , @xmath67 where @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 stands for the hodge dual ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "it is important to note that the previous eqs .  only differ in the sign inside the fourth term , and in the fact that the last term is written in each case with @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively",
    "since the horizon is a smooth surface , the left hand side of the above eqs.@xmath74is bounded on it . for the purely electric case ( i ) ,",
    "the last two terms in the right hand side of ( [ eq : riccise ] ) are non  negative , the remaining terms are perfect square , and consequently each term in the right hand side of ( [ eq : riccise ] ) is bounded at the horizon . in particular , the bounded behavior of the sixth term involving the quantities @xmath24 and @xmath75 implies , from the non  negativeness of these quantities , that they are also bounded at the horizon .",
    "it follows from the bounded behavior of the perfect  square terms where @xmath24 and @xmath75 are combined with the quantities @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively , that the last mentioned quantities are also bounded at the horizon .",
    "thus , any quantity appearing in the right hand side of ( [ eq : riccise ] ) is bounded at the horizon , in particular @xmath78 , @xmath77 and @xmath79 .",
    "the same conclusions can be achieved , along the same lines of reasoning , for the purely magnetic case ( ii ) , but this time using the right hand side of eq.@xmath80([eq : riccism ] ) .",
    "other invariants can be built from the ricci curvature ( [ eq : ein ] ) by means of @xmath59 and @xmath60 , which are well  defined smooth vector fields on the horizon .",
    "the first invariant reads @xmath81 where @xmath82 .",
    "the last term above vanishes because the bounded behavior of both the invariant @xmath77 and the potential @xmath83 .",
    "since @xmath84 is orthogonal to the null vector @xmath85 , it must be spacelike or null ( @xmath86 ) , therefore each one of the remaining terms on the right hand side of ( [ eq : riccinn ] ) must be bounded .",
    "the next invariant to be considered , which vanishes at the horizon due to the raychaudhuri equation for the null generator @xcite , reads @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the electric field at the horizon .",
    "once again the bounded behavior of the invariant @xmath77 and the potential @xmath24 can be used to achieve the vanishing of the last term of ( [ eq : riccill ] ) . since @xmath89 is orthogonal to the null generator @xmath59 , it must be spacelike or null ( @xmath90 ) , consequently each term on the right hand side of ( [ eq : riccill ] ) vanishes independently , which implies that @xmath91 and that @xmath89 is proportional to the null generator @xmath59 at the horizon , i.e. , @xmath92 .",
    "the vanishing of @xmath93 , only reproduces the fact that @xmath59 coincides with the killing field at the horizon .",
    "the last invariant to be studied gives the following relation : @xmath94 where it has been used that @xmath95 .",
    "because @xmath96 and @xmath97 are bounded at the horizon , and @xmath98 , the last two terms in the right hand side of ( [ eq : ricciln ] ) vanish , thus @xmath99 is bounded at the horizon as consequence of the bounded behavior of the left hand side of ( [ eq : ricciln ] ) .",
    "summarizing , the study of the quoted invariants at the horizon leads to the following conclusions : @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 are bounded at the horizon , while @xmath105 and @xmath106 in the same region .",
    "now we are in position to make a more detailed analysis of the sufficient conditions for the vanishing of the integrand ( [ eq : integ ] ) over the horizon , i.e. , @xmath65 vanishes and @xmath66 remains bounded at the horizon . using the definition @xmath88 and that @xmath107 , we obtain for the first quantity at the horizon @xmath108 since @xmath99 is bounded and @xmath109 vanishes at the horizon",
    ", it follows that the last expression vanishes at the horizon if the scalar field modulus @xmath55 does not vanishes in this region .",
    "we shall show at the end of this section that @xmath55 is a nonvanishing function at the horizon and in all the domain of outer communications @xmath1 .",
    "for the second quantity we note that @xmath110 and @xmath84 are orthogonal to the null vectors @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "therefore , @xmath110 must be spacelike or proportional to @xmath59 , and @xmath84 must be spacelike or proportional to @xmath60 . using a null tetrad basis , constructed with @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and a pair of linearly independent spacelike vectors , these last ones being tangent to the spacelike cross sections of the horizon , the @xmath110 and @xmath84 vectors can be written as @xmath111 @xmath112 where @xmath113 and @xmath114 are the projections , orthogonal to @xmath59 and @xmath60 , on the spacelike cross sections of the horizon . using ( [ eq : jnt ] ) and ( [ eq : int ] )",
    "it is clear that @xmath115 , and @xmath116 , i.e. , the contribution to these bounded magnitudes comes only from the spacelike sector orthogonal to @xmath59 and @xmath60 . with the help of ( [ eq : jnt ] ) and ( [ eq : int ] ) the other quantity appearing in the integrand ( [ eq : integ ] )",
    "can be written as @xmath117 where the identity @xmath118 has been used .",
    "the first term inside the braces in ( [ eq : int2b ] ) is bounded because @xmath119 and @xmath120 are bounded . to the second term",
    "the schwarz inequality applies , since @xmath113 and @xmath114 belong to a spacelike subspace .",
    "thus , @xmath121 and since @xmath79 and @xmath122 are bounded at the horizon , the second term inside the braces of ( [ eq : int2b ] ) is also bounded . since the term enclosed by the braces in ( [ eq : int2b ] ) is bounded , it follows that the bounded behavior at the horizon of the whole expression depends again in the nonvanishing property of the scalar field modulus @xmath55 in this region .",
    "the analysis of the sufficient conditions for the vanishing of the integrand ( [ eq : integ ] ) over the horizon shows that , the quantity ( [ eq : int1v ] ) vanishes at the horizon and the quantity ( [ eq : int2b ] ) remains bounded in this region if the scalar field modulus @xmath55 is a nonvanishing function at the horizon .",
    "all the conclusions achieved up to now , can be applied to both cases the purely electric ( i ) and the purely magnetic ( ii ) ones .",
    "to finish the demonstration of the vanishing of the integrand ( [ eq : integ ] ) over the horizon , it remains only to show that @xmath55 is a nonvanishing function in this region .",
    "we are able , by using the function @xmath123 below , to complete the demonstration for the purely electric case ( i ) .",
    "unfortunately , the purely magnetic case ( ii ) escapes to be treated along a similar way and it remains still as an open problem ; we believe that the `` no  hair '' conjecture applies also to this case .",
    "we proceed now to show that for the purely electric case ( i ) of spontaneously broken models ( @xmath124 ) @xmath55 is a strictly positive function in all the domain of outer communications , @xmath1 , of a static asymptotically flat black hole .",
    "in fact , let @xmath125 be any positive real number such that @xmath126 ( cf .  fig .",
    "[ fig : poten ] ) , where @xmath127 is the least value minimizing the potential function @xmath24 , then we shall show that @xmath128 in all of @xmath1 .",
    "this result implies , by continuity of @xmath55 , that @xmath129 also at the horizon . in order to arrive at this conclusion , the equation of motion ( [ eq : scalar ] ) for @xmath55",

    "this rests in the following : the integral identity ( [ eq : ints ] ) is obtained from the equation of motion ( [ eq : scalar ] ) .",
    "in order to this equation be satisfied in the domain of outer communications @xmath1 , the function @xmath55 must be @xmath138 , i.e. , twice differentiable in this region .",
    "on the other hand , most of the physically relevant potential are smooth functions , in fact , the mayor part of them are polynomial . in this sense",
    ", the fulfillment of ( [ eq : scalar ] ) implies , by the well  behaved nature of both its left hand side and the term involving the derivative of the potential , that the remaining term in this eq . , going as @xmath137 , is also well behaved in the domain of outer communications @xmath1 .    in @xmath139",
    "the boundary integrals over @xmath46 and @xmath45 cancel out again in the left hand side of ( [ eq : ints ] ) . the boundary integral over @xmath56 vanishes , because @xmath140 takes asymptotically some of the values @xmath25 minimizing the potential function @xmath24 , then by ( [ eq : prop ] ) the integrand vanishes there .",
    "the same happens to the integral over @xmath141 ; using the natural measure at the horizon the integrand can be written as @xmath142 where the vanishing of @xmath143 and the bounded behavior of @xmath144 at the horizon , together with the null character of @xmath59 and the bounded behavior of @xmath145 ( [ eq : prop ] ) imply the vanishing of the whole integrand at the horizon .",
    "since there are no contributions at the left hand side of ( [ eq : ints ] ) , the volume integral vanishes and we have for the purely electric case ( i ) @xmath146 where the coordinates from ( [ eq : static ] ) has been used . from the properties of @xmath123 , @xmath147 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 it follows that each term in the integrand above is non  negative , so , ( [ eq : zeros1 ] ) is fulfilled only if each of them vanishes identically in @xmath148 . in particular , @xmath149 , this condition can be satisfied if @xmath150 which implies , from the definition of @xmath123 ( [ eq : f ] ) , that @xmath151 .",
    "conversely , let now suppose that @xmath152 for some @xmath153 this requires , from the quoted condition , that @xmath154 and , from the definition of @xmath123 ( [ eq : f ] ) , that @xmath155 ( cf .  fig .",
    "[ fig : poten ] ) , hence , @xmath156 .",
    "the function @xmath55 can not vanishes in all of @xmath51 because it asymptotically approaches to one of the values @xmath25 for which @xmath24 achieves its minima .",
    "thus , by the connectedness of @xmath51 and the continuity of the function @xmath140 , @xmath157 is an interval in @xmath158 containing the points @xmath159 , which implies that the inverse image of the open interval @xmath160",

    "[ fig : poten ] and [ fig : function ] ) .",
    "summarizing , the assumption @xmath162 for some @xmath153 , implies the existence of a nonempty open subset of @xmath51 for which the condition @xmath163 is violated .",

    "the volume integral for the purely electric case ( i ) is written , using the coordinates from ( [ eq : static ] ) , as @xmath166 the nonpositiveness of the above integrand , which is minus the sum of squared terms , implies that the integral is vanishing only if @xmath41 and @xmath167 vanish everywhere in @xmath51 , and hence in all of @xmath5 .",
    "finally , we would like to explain why our proof on the nonvanishing of @xmath26 fails in the purely magnetic case ( ii ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the last term in the volume integral ( [ eq : zeros1 ] ) must be replaced , in the purely magnetic case ( ii ) , by the non  positive quantity @xmath168 ( cf .",
    "[ fig : function ] ) , since the first two terms are again non  negative the integrand have no definite sign and it is impossible to deduce the vanishing of it from the vanishing of the integral .",
    "so , the nonvanishing of @xmath55 for the purely magnetic case ( ii ) must be justified using a different approach .",
    "we are looking for a shortcut to solve this impasse , since we believe that the `` no  hair '' conjecture applies also to this case .",
    "for any successful justification of the condition @xmath169 , the rest of the proof follows in this way : the nonvanishing of @xmath55 implies again the vanishing of the integrand ( [ eq : integ ] ) over the horizon , having no contribution from boundary integrals in ( [ eq : int ] ) , the volume integral for the purely magnetic case ( ii ) can be written , using the coordinates from ( [ eq : static ] ) , as @xmath170 where again the non  negativeness of the integrand implies that the vanishing of the integral is satisfied only if @xmath171 and @xmath42 vanish everywhere in @xmath51 , and hence in all of @xmath1 .",
    "it is reasonable to expect , from the `` no  hair '' conjecture , that the only possible solutions for a scalar model in the domain of outer communications @xmath2 of a stationary asymptotically flat black hole become the vacuum expectation values of the self  interaction . in the models considered in this paper",
    "this implies the uniqueness of the scalar states @xmath172 , where @xmath173 are the values minimizing the potential function @xmath24 .",
    "we now concentrate our attention in the abelian higgs model , for which @xmath83 has a single minimum at @xmath174 , and we shall show the truthfulness of the last statement for the purely electric case ( i ) , without any dependence on the specific choice of the potential .",
    "the result is obtained by applying the same procedure used above for the eq .",

    "<S> the proof is gauge invariant , and is accomplished without any dependence on the model . in the particular case of the abelian higgs model , it is shown that the only solutions admitted for the scalar field become the vacuum expectation values of the self  interaction . </S>"
