    "the low - spin alignment of rh is then @xmath43 , @xmath44 giving rise to a moment of 1@xmath45atom .    in order to know the ground state electronic and magnetic structures of sr@xmath0rh@xmath1o@xmath2",
    ", we perform the dft calculations considering the co - operative effect of @xmath3 and soc .",

    "functional , sr@xmath0rh@xmath1o@xmath2 shows metallic characters for both spin - up and spin - down channels . for @xmath47ev , the topmost valence band in spin - up channel shifts deeper towards the valence region giving rise to an insulating state . in contrary , for spin - down channel the metallic state is maintained , except that the dos peak near @xmath48 is splitted due to strong electron - correlations .",
    "the effect of @xmath3 is comparatively small as expected due to partial occupation of the orbitals in spin - down channel . with spin - up channel insulating ( band - gap  0.9ev ) and the spin - down channel metallic , sr@xmath0rh@xmath1o@xmath2 is a half - metal ( hm ) .",
    "it is generally considered that the presence of heavy element with strong soc strength might destroy the hm state . in the present case",
    "it turns out that the hm state is fully preserved even with soc as observed in figure  2(c ) .",
    "this happens due to the large - exchange splitting between the spin - up and spin - down bands at @xmath48 .",
    "as revealed by the site - projected dos shown in figure  3 for spin - up and spin - down channels obtained from first - principles calculations within gga+@xmath3+so , two in - equivalent rh ions play significant role in dictating the electronic properties of sr@xmath0rh@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "the crystal field effect is found prominent in rh which causes the splitting between @xmath41 and @xmath42 states .",
    "the partial dos contribution from @xmath16 states of two in - equivalent rh atoms shows full occupation of the @xmath41 states with its sub - level @xmath49 and @xmath50 lying below @xmath48 , whereas the @xmath42 states are in the conduction region for spin - up channel . for spin - down channel ,",
    "the @xmath41 states are partially occupied due to deficiency of one electron in the @xmath50 sub - levels . as a result , these bands cross @xmath48 and form a continuous band at @xmath48 . the order of occupation observed in figure  3 is consistent with the ionic picture .",
    "the crystal - field energy ( @xmath291.3ev ) is close to the exchange energy splitting ( @xmath291.2ev ) between spin - up and spin - down bands of rh atoms .",
    "this clearly indicates the low - spin configuration consistent with the ionic picture .",
    "as shown in figure  3 , rh1 has a dominant @xmath41 characters near @xmath51 with an itinerant dos due to its strong hybridization with the oxygen atoms .",
    "on the other hand rh2 has a sharp peak near @xmath48 contributed by @xmath49 states since the hybridization with the oxygen is relatively weak unlike the @xmath50 states .",
    "this occurs mainly due to crystal distortion in sr@xmath0rh@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "since the hybridization of rh with the planar oxygen ( o1 ) is stronger than apical oxygen ( o2 ) in both spin channels , the moment induced at o1 is larger than o2 ( see table  2 ) .",
    "to distinguish the effect of soc , we show the spin - resolved band structure for sr@xmath0rh@xmath1o@xmath2 within gga+@xmath3 and gga+@xmath3+so as shown in figure  4 , together with a schematic diagram of the band ordering of rh-@xmath16 states .",
    "first we look at the gap between spin - up and spin - down channel in the conduction region for gga+@xmath3 . the gap is found to be @xmath290.1ev at high symmetry point @xmath52 in the brillouin zone ( bz ) ( see figure  4(left ) ) .",
    "when soc is considered , the electronic band structure is modified .",
    "the major changes are observed in the conduction region above @xmath53ev and in the valence region below -0.3ev . due to soc effect of rh ( @xmath54191mev)@xcite ,",
    "the spin - up bands in the conduction region at @xmath55ev are pushed up towards higher energy by the spin - down bands .",
    "this generates a gap of @xmath56ev at the high symmetry point @xmath52 in the conduction region ( see figure  4(right ) ) .",
    "similar changes are observed below @xmath51 around @xmath57ev , where the spin - up bands are pushed deeper in the valence region .",
    "thus , the bands at @xmath48 are purely of spin - down channel .",
    "this shows that hm state is fully preserved in sr@xmath0rh@xmath1o@xmath2 even though sizable soc exists .    at the ground state",
    "obtained from first - principles calculations , the total angular moment ( @xmath58 ) is 12@xmath59 per unit cell contributed by rh atoms and oxygen atoms ( see table  2 ) .",
    "the orbital contribution in rh ( @xmath60 ) is in accordance with the hund s third rule , where rh with more than half - filled @xmath41-shell has its orbital moment parallel to its spin moment .",
    "the rh moment is less than unity , with the remaining part transferred to oxygen due to strong hybridization as seen from the partial dos ( see figure  3 ) .",
    "planar oxygen atoms have higher moment than the apical oxygen due to shorter bond - length with rh - ions . in an ionic picture , each rh ion carries moment @xmath61 giving rise to @xmath58 @xmath62 in a unit cell , consistent with the first - principles calculations .",

    "we consider the replacement of rh by co atoms , which corresponds to iso - valent doping into the parent material sr@xmath0rh@xmath1o@xmath2 . in the ionic picture co",

    "the spin state transforms from low - spin of sr@xmath0rh@xmath1o@xmath2 to intermediate - spin @xmath63 .",
    "the spin - state transition is observed frequently in cobaltates@xcite .",
    "we focus on the most interesting case ( i.e. full - replacement of rh by co atoms ) where hm state is achieved .    from the total and partial dos of sr@xmath0co@xmath1o@xmath2 shown in figure  5 , the material has full occupation of the @xmath41 states and partial occupation of the @xmath42 states resulting to a metallic state in spin - up channel . in spin - down channel ,",
    "@xmath49 state is fully occupied whereas the remaining @xmath41 and @xmath42 states lie in the conduction region .",
    "this gives rise to band - gap of @xmath290.5ev in spin - down channel .",
    "due to crystal distortion the @xmath16 states of co hybridize strongly with the o-2p states in both spin - channels .",
    "it is interesting to note that doping of co flips the insulating state from spin - up to spin - down channel due to intermediate - spin configuration of co in sr@xmath0co@xmath1o@xmath2@xcite .",
    "thus , with metallic state in spin - up channel and the insulating state in spin - down channel , the material sr@xmath0co@xmath1o@xmath2 is a hm .    from the first - principles calculations ,",
    "the total angular moment is found to be @xmath58 = @xmath64 per unit cell .",
    "the moments of co atoms and oxygen atoms are shown in table  2 .",
    "first - principles calculations on magnetic anisotropy energy of sr@xmath0rh@xmath1o@xmath2 and sr@xmath0co@xmath1o@xmath2 indicate the @xmath65 axis of the crystal as their easy axis with anisotropy energy of @xmath66mev and @xmath67mev per unit cell , respectively .",
    "soc mixes the spin - up and spin - down electrons together which possibly destroys the hm state . in the present materials",
    "the exchange - splitting between the spin - up and spin - down dos at @xmath48 is large ( see figures  2 and  5 ) , which makes the mixing marginally small at @xmath48 .",
    "hence , hm state is preserved even with soc .    from our calculations ,",
    "the material sr@xmath0rh@xmath1o@xmath2 has larger exchange splitting which reduces the mixing of spin - up and spin - down bands at @xmath48 , and its low total moment causes a small stray field generated by local magnetic ions . hence compared to sr@xmath0co@xmath1o@xmath2 with a three - time larger moment , sr@xmath0rh@xmath1o@xmath2 is more desirable as a hmf .",
    "based on the first - principles density functional approach , sr@xmath0rh@xmath1o@xmath2 is found to be a half metallic ferromagnet due to the cooperative effect from coulomb interaction , spin - orbit coupling and the crystal field . it is demonstrated that doping iso - valent atom into the system by replacing rh with co , a half metal with larger moment is achieved .",
    "it is emphasized that the large exchange splitting between spin - up and spin - down bands at the fermi level retains the half metallicity even in presence of spin - orbit coupling .",
