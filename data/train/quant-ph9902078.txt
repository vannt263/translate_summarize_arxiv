    "it is well understood that the electromagnetic fields giving rise to all optical phenomena have ultimately to be represented by quantum operators .",
    "these couple to the degrees of freedom of matter and their modification due to this interaction constitutes the quantum counterpart of the action of optical components .",
    "ordinary optical devices operate in the linear regime of interaction , but the important area of nonlinear optics is based on higher order effects of the field - matter coupling . in most situations , the optical phenomena can be described entirely in terms of classical fields , but many recent investigations require that the quantum character of the field is accounted for .",
    "such research constitutes the topics of quantum optics @xcite .",
    "however , many quantum effects are of interest even in the linear regime of operation : quantum noise @xcite sets the limit to communication by optical channels and amplifiers , quantum interference shows up in precision measurements and tests of fundamental issues and also in reading and writing quantum information .",
    "manipulation of quantum information such as quantum computations usually requires the inclusion of higher order effects , i.e. nonlinear interactions between the qubits @xcite .    in this paper , we are going to discuss the dynamics of single photon wave packets in various two - dimensional atomic configurations .",
    "these are taken to be models of optical networks , where we explicitly include the atomic nature of the optical components distributed over the volume under investigation .",
    "this approach provide us with a completely microscopic quantum - mechanical picture of how photon wave packets interact with optical elements represented as collections of two level atoms . for practical reasons",
    ", we have to restrict our work to one - photon states , but this is not such a serious limitation as it may seem .",
    "all _ linear _ optical effects are based on the single - photon interacting with material structures , and consequently we have a general description of quantum optics phenomena in the linear regime . the need to consider multi - photon effects arises only in connection with the quantum treatment of nonlinear optics .",
    "there are two basic ways to approach the quantization of optical systems . in the conventional one , we determine a complete set of eigenmodes of the total universe , and express the fields of interest in terms of these .",
    "any matter present is described through its interaction with the fields , and the coupled field - matter problem is then solved to the best of our ability . this is the approach utilized in traditional qed , and its development is found in many standard texts .",
    "the alternative approach , designed for quantum optics applications , is to determine the eigenmodes of the system at the classical level , the matter involved is then treated as boundary conditions on the field modes .",
    "especially the new area of cavity qed research @xcite , utilizes this point of view , and it provides the basis both for quantum communication theories and many fundamental investigations .    in the field of optics ,",
    "the components are usually treated as boundary conditions only , and the complete optical device is considered to be an optical network .",
    "this approach has been discussed thoroughly in the classical regime of operation @xcite . for linear devices",
    ", the classical treatment can be taken over into the quantum regime by the use of suitable quantum optics tools @xcite . in principle ,",
    "any device understood classically , can be treated quantum mechanically with such an approach . the specific quantum features manifest themselves in the initial conditions and the restrictions on observability imposed by quantum theory @xcite .",
    "another specifically quantum mechanical effect is the occurrence of spontaneous decay . within a one - dimensional model of the modes of the universe , this is discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where both free weisskopf - wigner decay and cavity modified decay are discussed .",
    "such phenomena have been the object of much interest within qed research , for an extensive list of references see ref .",
    "@xcite . within the model chosen there",
    ", one can see the emergence of the exponential law and the inhibition of decay observed in a photonic band gap structure .",
    "in general , the model provides insight into the role of atomic media in the irreversible transfer of excitation energy into the field modes of the universe .    in this paper",
    "we combine the two views discussed above : we retain a description in terms of a complete set of two - dimensional eigenmodes of the universe .",
    "the optical components are described in terms of their atomic constituents .",
    "all atomic structures are represented by spatially localized two - level atoms .",
    "these are treated as point - like partciles in accordance with the dipole approximation assumed to be valid .",
    "the state of the field is taken to be a single photon wave packet with a narrow energy distribution . in this case",
    ", the state can be described by a truncated expansion in terms of modes of the universe .",
    "the spatially distributed two - level atoms describing the structures are taken to be initially in their ground states .",
    "the atoms can be chosen to resonate with the central frequency of the photon wave packet or be well off resonance ; various effects can be modeled in this way .",
    "when the single photon is absorbed , only one of the atoms is excited , and the field is reduced to its ground state .",
    "such a choice limits the hilbert space needed in the calculations to manageable size , but allows us to investigate many simple networks of significance in linear optics .",
    "all such effects are , in principle , describable at the single photon level ; only nonlinear optics effects require more photons , which would make the hilbert space expand beyond the limits of available computer resources .",
    "our approach based on a complete set of eigenmodes allows us to investigate the dynamic performance of many linear systems . in order to illustrate the method , we select the simplest optical components : mirrors , beam splitters , focusing devices and interferometers .",
    "the over - all performance of the components follows directly from their classical theory , but our approach allows us to investigate the microscopic ( quantum ) behavior of the setup .",
    "quantum coherence between various spatial regions in the device is directly visible in the states calculated , and the time and space scales of the various interferometric structures can be read off the results .",
    "combined with various models of measurements , our calculations contain considerably more information than a simple classical computation .",
    "here we only discuss the measurement of frequency and the possible occurrence of filtering action in the atomic structures , which does not in itself depend too much on the quantum nature of the fields . but modeling the frequency detection by atomic absorption , we utilize the full character of the model , which allows further extension to quantum correlation measurements if we so desire .",
    "our work is based on the model put forward in @xcite which we extend to two dimensions .",
    "the quantized modes of the universe are introduced in sec .",
    "ii together with their interaction with the spatially distributed atoms . in sec .",
    "iii we specify the details of the model and indicate how the calculations have been carried out .",
    "section iv presents the various simple components analyzed in this paper .",

    "it can be said that only this method makes these simulations possible .",
    "there are several natural checks for the numerical simulations .",
    "first of all the norm of the wavefunction has to remain unity for all times .",

    "the two methods should give the same results .",
    "in the following simulations the spectrum is detected using so - called analyzer atoms @xcite .",
    "many atoms with a very small dipole coupling constant are put into specific locations in the cavity .",

    "gives the same decay constant @xmath97 for all the atoms because in two dimensions @xmath97 is directly proportional to the product @xmath98 .",
    "because the dipole coupling is small , the atoms have very small decay constants and linewidths and only the radiation which is exactly on resonance with the atom can excite it .",
    "therefore the excitation of the atoms as function of @xmath99 can be interpreted as a spectrum of the field at the position of the atoms . because the interaction between the radiation and the atoms is small ,",

    "the initial gaussian photon wave packet has an energy density centered at @xmath106 , @xmath107 .",
    "the wave packet is moving to the right . during the free evolution energy density",
    "becomes delocalized . from the figure we see that at @xmath108 the width in the @xmath39-direction is much larger than the initial value .",
    "this spread of the width of the original wave packet is a standard quantum - mechanical effect .",
    "it is possible to `` build '' mirrors and beam splitters using two level atoms . in the next simulation many atoms with large dipole constants",
    "were arranged into a slab configuration .",
    "we take a @xmath109 angle between the slab and the @xmath38-axis .",
    "we assume all atoms to have the same transition frequencies and dipole constants .",
    "the initial photon wave packet has a gaussian distribution ( [ gauss ] ) with parameters @xmath110 , @xmath103 and @xmath111 .",
    "the atoms in the slab are exactly on resonance with the incoming photon wave packet ( i.e. the central frequency of the wave packet @xmath112 is equal to the transition frequency of the atoms ) .",
    "the dipole constant is large @xmath113 .",
    "we assume that the mirror is composed of eight layers of atoms as close to each other as possible .",
    "in our case we assume to distance between neighboring layers of the atoms to coincide with the grid in the configuration space ( the grid spacing is @xmath114 and for the given orientation of the mirror the distance between the different atomic layers is chosen to be @xmath115 ) .",
    "the central wavelength of the incoming photon wave packet is @xmath116 so the difference between the neighboring atoms much shorter than the wavelength of the incoming wave packet .",
    "we plot the energy density of the one - photon wave packet reflected by the mirror in fig .",
    "[ figmirror ] .",
    "firstly we plot the initial wave packet at @xmath117 ( a ) .",
    "the photon is coming towards the atoms of the mirror .",
    "these atoms become excited by the incoming wave packet .",
    "the `` secondary '' radiation which is emitted by the atoms interfere with the incoming wave packet .",
    "this secondary radiation can formally be expressed as a sum of the two terms - the first destructively interfere with the incoming wave packet . as a consequence of this interference",
    "the incoming wave packet is `` destroyed '' ( i.e. becomes extinct ) . the other part of the radiation which is `` collectively '' radiated by the atoms of the mirror represents the reflected wave packet .",
    "in fact , the process of reflection of the wave packet by atoms of the mirror represents purely quantum ( microscopic ) version of the ewald - oseen extinction theorem @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ figmirror](b ) we have chosen conditions such that at @xmath108 all the radiation is reflected by the atoms .",
    "the direction of propagation of the reflected wave packet is the same as expected in the classical theory .",
    "the energy density compared to the incoming wave packet is changed but is still clearly localized . note that the energy density is not perfectly symmetrical .",
    "the reason is the same as in the simulation with a free photon , i.e. the distribution in @xmath118-space is broad and near the origin so the spread of the wave packet is clearly seen .",
    "additionally , the interference between components of radiation emitted by different atoms of the mirror plays a role . in the left part of fig .",
    "[ figphotonatmandbs ] we see the energy density of the photon wave packet close to the surface of the mirror . we see that the incoming and reflected parts interfere .",
    "we also see that no energy is transmitted by the atomic slab . in this sense",
    "the atoms serve as a mirror .",
    "nevertheless , one has to remember that the atoms during the process of reflection of the original wave packet become excited , that is the mirror under consideration has its own `` internal '' ( quantum ) degrees of freedom , so the part of the original energy can be ( transiently ) absorbed by the mirror .",
    "this also result in the fact that this quantum mirror might become entangled with the reflected wave packet .",
    "we note that the parameters of the atoms in this simulation were carefully chosen in such a way that the atoms really form a mirror .",
    "if the parameters are changed then part of the radiation can be transmitted , that is the collection of the atoms can play a rle of a beam splitter .      in the previous simulation",
    "we have shown that it is possible to build an almost perfect mirror using two level atoms , assuming the parameters are chosen correctly . using slightly different parameters , we find that the atoms can behave as a beam splitter .",
    "there are several ways how to modify the `` mirror '' configuration to obtain a beam splitter  for instance , we can consider a smaller number of atoms , or we can decrease the dipole constants , or change the resonance frequencies of the atoms .",
    "we tried all the possibilities and the most satisfactory results were obtained by detuning the atoms .",
    "the frequencies of the atoms are now taken to be @xmath119 .",
    "the center frequency of the incoming photon wave packet is @xmath120 , i.e. the detuning is really large .",

    "there is only one layer of atoms instead of eight as in the mirror simulation . at @xmath117",
    "the photon is propagating towards the atoms .",
    "here again the incoming wave packet excites the atoms .",
    "now the quantum interference between the incoming and emitted radiation is such that part of the original wave packet is transmitted by the layer of the atoms .",
    "the other part is reflected . in fig .",
    "[ figbs ] we clearly see that at @xmath108 the original wave packet is split into two parts propagating up and to the right .",
    "the energy is divided equally , that is the atoms form a 50 - 50 beam splitter for the incoming photon . here",
    "we stress that the beam splitter under consideration has its own internal degrees of freedom and transiently it becomes excited .",
    "nevertheless , after a while the atoms completely emit the excitation energy and the beam splitter is in a ground state - at this point it is completely disentangled from the one - photon radiation field which is now in a pure superposition state with two macroscopically distinguishable components ( reflected and transmitted ) .    in the right hand part of fig .",
    "[ figphotonatmandbs ] energy density of the photon wave packet is shown close to the `` surface '' of the beam splitter . to the left of the atoms the incoming and reflected wave packets interfere .",
    "we also see that a fraction of the original radiation is able to `` pass '' the atoms and to continue to propagate to the right .",
    "the wavelength of the photon was chosen shorter than in the mirror simulation , which can be seen from the interference structure .",
    "we have also studied spectral properties of reflected and transmitted parts of the original wave packet . in this situation",
    "200 atoms were used to detect the time dependent spectra of the two outgoing parts of the photon by applying the method described earlier .",
    "both spectra were identical to the spectrum of the incoming photon .",
    "this means that our quantum beam splitters and mirrors are linear devices , which is important if we want to build optical networks out of the considered optical elements .",
    "another illustration of the power of our microscopic model of optical elements is the parabolic mirror .",
    "in fact , it is possible to `` build '' out of two - level atoms mirrors of arbitrary shapes . in the next simulation ,",
    "the photon wave packet is propagating towards a parabolic mirror the shape of which is described by the equation @xmath121 .",

    "we see the interference between the incoming and the re - emitted radiation .",
    "we note that at @xmath125 most of the radiation goes through the focus . in the last figure ( @xmath126 ) the photon wave packet propagates to the left .      using a quantum beam splitter and two quantum mirrors we can `` construct '' a single - photon interferometer ( see fig .  [ figifshift00 ] ) . here",
    "the one - photon wave packet comes towards the beam splitter ( @xmath117 ) and is divided into two parts which propagate towards the mirrors ( @xmath126 ) .",

    "on the other hand due to the quantum interference between the components of the radiation field coming from the two mirrors we can observe something completely different : if the optical paths of the two components are equal then their relative relative phase is such that quantum interference results in an emergence of a single - photon wave packet traveling up ( @xmath128 ) . on the contrary , if the distances of the two mirrors from the beam splitter are not equal then the relative phase of the two components which interfere on the beam splitter after being reflected by the mirrors can result in a wave packet traveling left ( see fig .",

    "this process of bouncing of the original wave packet between two mirror continues and each time a fraction of the energy passes through the slits .",
    "it is interesting to compare the interference structure with the theoretical prediction derived within classical optics .",
    "the formula can be calculated using huygens principle @xcite . according to this , every point at the slit",
    "can be considered to be a source of secondary wavelets .",
    "the total intensity profile is a superposition of these wavelets .",
    "let us first consider a text book treatment of a one slit mirror , fig .",
    "[ slitfigure ] .",
    "the plane wave packet of the frequency @xmath99 is coming from the left towards a slit of a width @xmath131 .",
    "the field strength on the right coming from a specific point at the slit is proportional to the phase factor @xmath132 .",
    "the phase difference of the radiation coming from two different spatial points in the slit is @xmath133 , if the distance from the mirror is long enough . according to the huygens principle",
    "the total radiation is a superposition    @xmath134    for two slits of width @xmath131 and a separation @xmath135 we have two integrals    @xmath136    which gives for the intensity    @xmath137    on the other hand , we can use results of our numerical simulations and evaluate the intensity of the radiation which has been created to the right of the two - slit mirror during the first reflection of the original wave packet :    @xmath138    to neglect the contribution of the second reflection we take the lower bound of the integral over the polar coordinate @xmath139 to be @xmath140 . the theoretical prediction ( [ theoreticalintensity ] ) and",
    "the intensity derived from our simulations ( [ intensitytheta ] ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ figthetaintensity2curves ] .",
    "both intensities are normalized in such a way that their maximum is equal to unity . near @xmath141",
    "the agreement between the two results is very good . for larger values of @xmath142",
    "there is a difference between the two lines which is understandable because we are comparing a classical result with a numerical simulation of a quantum model with realistic features such as the nonzero width of a mirror composed of two - level atoms or the wave packet which is not a plane wave , etc .",
    "taking these differences into account it is surprising that the two pictures coincide so well .",
    "till now we have considered in our simulations that the field has been initially excited and all the atoms were initially in the ground state . obviously , our model can be also applied to a situation when one of the atoms is excited and the field is initially in the vacuum state ( i.e. , we still restrict ourselves to the one - excitation subspace of the total hilbert space ) . in this section",
    "we briefly discuss the problem of a spontaneous decay of a two - level atom in a two - dimensional cavity .",
    "we consider the atomic transition frequency to be @xmath143 and the dipole constant is @xmath144 .",
    "the atom is situated at the origin ( @xmath145 , @xmath107 ) of the two - dimensional cavity .",
    "the number of the field modes is 256@xmath146256=65536 . in fig .",
    "[ decayexcitation ] we present the natural logarithm of the excitation probability of the atom as a function of time . from here",
    "we can conclude that the decay of the atom is approximately exponential with a decay constant @xmath147 . in fig .",
    "[ decaykslides ] we present probabilities of the excitation of the modes @xmath148 ( @xmath149=0 ) . because the direction of the constant dipole vector of the atom is chosen to be in the @xmath150-direction ,",
    "the amplitude profile is the same on any line which goes through the origin of the momentum space .",
    "as expected for times large enough the modes with @xmath151 are dominantly excited .",
    "in fact the peaks are not exactly at the resonance frequency , there is a small shift which is identified to be a lamb shift ( from the figures we can not see this but the shift can be determined from numerical values obtained in the simulation ) .",
    "we plot the energy density of the one - photon wave packet emitted by the decaying atom in fig .",
    "[ decayintensity ] . because of the rotational symmetry of the problem we plot just one `` cut '' ( @xmath123 ) in the energy density as a function of @xmath38 .",
    "the energy density is presented for two times @xmath152 and @xmath153 . at both times there is a peak in the center where the atom is positioned .",
    "this means that at these two times the atom still emits the radiation ( which is in agreement with the chosen decay rate @xmath154 ) .",
    "we turn our attention to the fact that at @xmath152 the energy density is nonzero only for @xmath155 .",
    "analogously for the time @xmath153 the energy density is nonzero only for @xmath156 .",
    "this reflects the fact that the causality is preserved in our simple quantum - mechanical treatment of the decay of the two - level atom in the cavity .",
    "here we have presented just few features of the decay , the complete description of the process deserves more detailed discussion .",
    "for instance , one might be interested on how the decay depends on the mode spectra , the position of the atom , what are the values of the lamb shift , how the decay depends on the frequency cut - off , etc .",
    "we will address these questions elsewhere .",
    "we have shown the results of many quantum mechanical simulations with two level atoms and a one photon wave packet inside a two dimensional cavity .",
    "the initial basis vectors are restricted to admit only one excitation .",
    "because a rotating wave interaction between the radiation and the atoms is used , basis vectors with more excitations acquire no excitation . for these kinds of states the special numerical technique which utilizes fft ( fast fourier transform )",
    "may be used .",
    "using fft the simulations become orders of magnitude faster , allowing more modes and atoms to be included .    the atoms are at fixed positions and it is possible to build complicated structures with different kinds of atoms .",
    "several layers of atoms which are on resonance with the incoming radiation form a quantum mechanical mirror if the density of the atoms is high enough .",
    "the mirror may have an arbitrary shape . in our simulations",
    "usual flat and parabolic mirror were used .",
    "one layer of detuned atoms forms a beam splitter .",
    "we have shown that , using mirrors and beam splitters , it is possible to build complicated optical networks . as an example",
    "the time evolution of a photon in an interferometer was studied .",
    "usually the optical components are taken to be classical objects which give boundary conditions to the quantum mechanical time evolution or determine the modes used in a quantization . in our simulations",
    "the whole system including beam splitters and mirrors is in a well - defined quantum mechanical state .",
    "in addition to the simulations shown in this paper is is possible to build more complicated networks of beam splitters and mirrors .",
    "one interesting possibility is to build cavities of arbitrary shape and study the time evolution of the photon intensity inside the cavity .",
    "it is also possible to use moving atoms in the simulations allowing moving beam splitters and mirrors to be built .",
    "one extension of the current model would be to take basis states with more than one photon excitation into account .",
    "however , the number of basis states with a given excitation increases so rapidly that it is unlikely to be possible to use the methods of this paper for fields of higher intensity .",
    "thus all the phenomena of nonlinear optics require novel computational approaches .",
    "we want to thank the academy of finland and the slovak academy of sciences for the financial support .",
    "this work was supported in part by the royal society .",
    "computers of the center for scientific computing ( csc ) were used in the simulations . in many computer programs the c++ class library `` blitz '' developed by todd veldhuizen was used ( http://monet.uwaterloo.ca/blitz/ ) .",
    "finally we want to thank k - a .",
