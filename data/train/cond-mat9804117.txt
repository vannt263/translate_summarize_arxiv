    "this should pick out one of the 3 b.c.s a , b or c ( for generic phases of @xmath188 ) .",
    "@xmath189 takes on a finite value for infinitesimal @xmath188 corresponding to a 1st order transition .",
    "this becomes especially obvious by again using duality but now running the argument backwards .",
    "that is , let s now study the dual model with 0 transverse field and a small non - zero longitudinal field , @xmath188 .",
    "this corresponds to the original model with a transverse field @xmath190 h.c . but",
    "zero classical potts interaction @xmath191 + h.c . clearly , @xmath188 produces a 1st order transition in this model since the 1st site is exactly decoupled .",
    "we can diagonalize @xmath192 and 1 or the other of the 3 eigenstates will be the groundstate depending on the phase of @xmath188 ( for generic values of this phase ) . in the dual model this corresponds to 1st order transitions between eigenstates of @xmath193 when a longitudinal field is turned on ( with a non - zero classical potts interaction of order 1 ) .",
    "it is also clear that there are special values for the phase of @xmath188 for which 2 groundstates remain degenerate so another 1st order transition occurs , across the negative real @xmath188 axis ( and the 2 other axes rotated by @xmath194 . )    from eq .",
    "( [ ht0 ] ) , there are 6 relevant boundary operators of dimension 2/3 at the @xmath184 fixed point .",
    "we may identify these with these with the 6 tunneling processes @xmath195 , @xmath196 , etc . imposing @xmath14 symmetry ,",
    "no dimension 0 operators and only 2 dimension 2/3 operators are allowed .",
    "the latter couple to the complex transverse field , @xmath160 .",
    "thus we see that the flow away from @xmath184 to the new or free fixed points is driven by @xmath197 operators .",
    "further insight into the nature of the new fixed point can be gained by considering again the model with no classical potts interaction between sites 0 and 1 , @xmath198 and no longitudinal field .",
    "thus we have a potts chain with a free b.c . at 1 and an additional decoupled potts spin at 0 . for real positive @xmath160",
    ", the decoupled potts spin has a unique symmetric groundstate , ( 1,1,1 ) . in this case",
    ", we expect that turning on the classical potts interaction with the 1st site leads to the free fixed point .",
    "the end spin is simply adsorbed , with a flow from free to free . on the other hand , for real and negative @xmath160",
    ", the groundstate of the decoupled spin at 0 is 2-fold degenerate .",
    "these 2 states can be chosen to be @xmath199 and @xmath200 . turning on the classical potts interaction",
    "should now produce a flow to the new fixed point from the above discussion .",
    "thus we get a flow from a free b.c . with a decoupled system with a 2-fold degeneracy , to the new b.c .",
    "this is somewhat like the rg flow in the s=1/2 kondo problem , with the 2 states of the decoupled spin in the potts model corresponding to spin up or down in the kondo model .",
    "the flow to the new fixed point is analogous to kondo - screening of the impurity .",
    "a related problem , an impurity with triangular symmetry coupled to conduction electrons , was discussed in [ ] .",
    "the 2-fold degeneracy of the groundstates of the impurity is guaranteed by the @xmath14 symmetry ( for the appropriate sign of the tunneling term ) and can lead to 2-channel kondo behaviour ( when electron spin is taken into account ) without the fine - tuning necessary for ordinary 2-level impurities .",
    "we note that both these problems correspond to a @xmath14 symmetric impurity coupled to a dissipative environment . in [ ]",
    "this environment is the conduction electrons ; in our model it is the rest of the potts chain .    the dual version of this last rg flow is easily constructed . at site 1/2",
    "there is originally a longitudinal field but no transverse field .",
    "thus the system is in a sum of 2 states , @xmath201 . upon turning on the transverse field",
    "we expect a flow to the mixed state @xmath202 .",
    "let us now consider the classical potts model of eq .",
    "( [ class ] ) .",
    "we may again construct the new boundary fixed point using duality .",
    "the first step is to fourier transform the factor associated with each link , @xmath203 in the partition sum .",
    "thus we introduce a new angular variable , @xmath204 , taking on values @xmath205 , @xmath44 associated with the link ij by : @xmath206 where @xmath20 is a normalization constant .",
    "we now sum over the original potts variables , @xmath207 . ignoring the boundaries , for the moment",
    ", the sum over the potts variable at each site gives a constraint on the 4 link variables associated with the links terminating at the site .",

    "@xmath208 where @xmath209 .",
    "we may solve these constraints by introducing new angular variables , @xmath210 ( also restricted to the values 0,@xmath44 ) on the dual lattice , i.e. the centers of the squares of the original lattice .",
    "[ see fig .",
    "( [ fig : classdual ] ) ] . explicitly : @xmath211 the partition function is transformed into : @xmath212 thus we get back the original potts model with a dual coupling constant , @xmath213 .",
    "the critical coupling is given by the self - duality condition , @xmath214 , which gives : @xmath215    now consider the system with a free boundary along the x - axis with a boundary potts interaction @xmath216 ( and no fields at the boundary ) .",
    "consider summing over the potts variable @xmath207 at the boundary , as indicated in fig .",
    "( [ fig : dualbound ] ) .",
    "this gives the constraint : @xmath217 writing @xmath218 in terms of the dual variables , this becomes : @xmath219 we may solve this equation for all sites , i , along the boundary by : @xmath220 thus the edge of the dual lattice is at @xmath221 .",
    "in addition to the bulk potts interaction of strength @xmath213 , given by eq .",

    "we expect that the new critical point occurs when the dual model has a real negative @xmath148 .",
    "this requires a complex @xmath216 , im(@xmath227 . noting that the ratio of boltmann weights for @xmath228 or @xmath229 is @xmath230 , we see that this implies real but negative boltzmann weights . in particular , we way regard the new fixed point as corresponding to an infinite negative @xmath148 ; this corresponds to @xmath231 in the quantum model , discussed above",
    ", this limit eliminates the symmetric state ( 1,1,1 ) on the first site , projecting onto the 2 orthogonal states .",
    "the same projection is realized in the standard transfer matrix formalism for the classical potts model .",
    "the potts model with negative boltzmann weights in the bulk occurs quite naturally in the cluster formulation based on the high temperatures expansion.@xcite    we note that the values of the `` groundstate degeneracies '' of the various fixed points , @xmath232 are given by : @xmath233 noting that @xmath234 we see that : @xmath235 thus all rg flows that we have discussed are consistent with the `` g- theorem''@xcite ( or `` g - conjecture '' as it is more accurately referred to ) .",
    "g always decreases under an rg flow .",
    "we also note that the various flows which are related by duality have the same ratios of g - factors : @xmath236    this research was begun while all three authors were visitors at the institute for theoretical physics , santa barbara .",
    "the research of ia and mo was supported by nserc of canada and the killam foundation . that of hs by the doe , the nsf and the packard foundation .",
    "at present , the most general and systematic method to construct a new boundary state is fusion . for rational cfts ( with a finite number of conformal towers ) ,",
    "fusion is quite a powerful method .",
    "empirically it has been recognized that fusion is a kind of irreversible process : when a boundary state @xmath21 is obtained by fusion from another boundary state @xmath20 , fusion on @xmath21 does not generally gives @xmath20 .",
    "( sometimes it does . )",
    "this irreversibility reminds us of the `` @xmath238-theorem '' which states that the groundstate degeneracy @xmath238 of the system always decreases along the boundary renormalization group flow.@xcite actually , here we prove that the irreversibility of fusion is also related to the groundstate degeneracy @xmath238 .",
    "amusingly , the `` direction '' is opposite to that of renormalization group flow .",
    "we state the following :    theorem : :    we consider a unitary rational cft .",
    "let @xmath21 be a boundary    state obtained by fusion from the boundary state @xmath20 .",
    "the    groundstate degeneracy of @xmath21 is always greater than or    equal to that of @xmath20 .    to prove the theorem , first let give us the definition of the groundstate degeneracy .",
    "given a boundary state @xmath239 , the groundstate degeneracy of the state @xmath240 is given by the following : @xmath241 where @xmath242 is the groundstate of the system and we choose the overall phase of @xmath239 so that @xmath240 is positive .",
    "for unitary cfts , the groundstate corresponds to the identity operator with conformal weight @xmath205 .",
    "we denote this identity primary as @xmath205 . the definition of eq .",
    "( [ degdef ] ) follows from the fact that the partition function is proportional to this matrix element in the limit of an infinite length system .    on the other hand ,",
    "a general relation for fusion@xcite reads : @xmath243 where @xmath244 represents an aribitrary primary field , @xmath245 is the primary used for fusion from @xmath20 to @xmath21 , and @xmath246 is the modular @xmath247- matrix element for primaries @xmath248 and @xmath249 .",
    "the special case @xmath250 ( identity ) gives the relation between the degeneracies : @xmath251    now we employ the verlinde formula@xcite : @xmath252 the special case @xmath250 and @xmath253 ( @xmath254 is the conjugate of @xmath245 ) , combined with eq .",
    "( [ eq : gbga1 ] ) gives @xmath255 where we used the fact the operator product expansion between @xmath245 and its conjugate @xmath254 always contains the identity operator .",
    "since the fusion rule coefficients @xmath256 are nonnegative integers , the theorem follows if @xmath257 .",
    "actually , it is known that @xmath258 for any primary @xmath259 , proved as follows.@xcite consider the character @xmath260 . by modular transformation ,",
    "@xmath261 when evaluating the limit @xmath262 , the right - hand side is dominated by the lowest power of @xmath25 .",
    "thus @xmath263 .",
    "( here @xmath245 in the exponent is the central charge of the cft . ) since the left - hand side and @xmath264 are both positive , @xmath265 .",
    "thus the theorem is proved .",
    "our theorem is of course consistent with all known cases , including boundary states of the ising and potts models .",
    "when there is an rg flow between two boundary states , our theorem implies that the direction of the fusion rule construction is opposite .",
    "namely , we can obtain an unstable boundary state from a more stable boundary state , but the reverse is not possible .",
    "however , there can be an exception : if there are some extra degrees of freedom , the rg flow can be in the same direction as the fusion .",
    "an example of this is the kondo effect ; the screened state , which has larger groundstate degeneracy than the original state , is constructed by fusion . however , if we take the degeneracy due to the impurity spin into account , the total degeneracy is smaller in the screened state .",
    "thus the rg flow occurs from the unscreened to screened state .    that fusion generates rather opposite `` flow '' to the rg one makes it somewhat difficult to understand the physical meaning of fusion , which is a more or less abstract mathematical manipulation .",
    "perhaps the best intuition is gained again from the example of the kondo effect .",
    "namely , fusion roughly corresponds to an absorption of some degree of freedom by the boundary .",
    "considering the generality of the present result , it is tempting to imagine some deeper connection with the `` @xmath238-theorem '' on the rg flow .",
