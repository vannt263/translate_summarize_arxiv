    "in this paper we consider the applications of numerical - analytical approach based on multiscale variational wavelet technique to the systems with collective type behaviour described by some forms of vlasov - poisson / maxwell equations [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] .",
    "such approach may be useful in all models in which it is possible and reasonable to reduce all complicated problems related with statistical distributions to the problems described by the systems of nonlinear ordinary / partial differential / integral equations with or without some ( functional ) constraints .",
    "in periodic accelerators and transport systems at the high beam currents and charge densities the effects of the intense self - fields , which are produced by the beam space charge and currents , determinine ( possible ) equilibrium states , stability and transport properties according to underlying nonlinear dynamics [ 2 ] .",
    "the dynamics of such space - charge dominated high brightness beam systems can provide the understanding of the instability phenomena such as emittance growth , mismatch , halo formation related to the complicated behaviour of underlying hidden nonlinear modes outside of perturbative tori - like kam regions .",
    "our analysis is based on the variational - wavelet approach from [ 3]-[17 ] , which allows us to consider polynomial and rational type of nonlinearities . in some sense",
    "our approach is direct generaliztion of traditional nonlinear @xmath0 approach in which weighted klimontovich representation @xmath1 or self - similar decompostion [ 2 ] like @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a shape function of distributing particles on the grids in configuration space , are replaced by powerful technique from local nonlinear harmonic analysis , based on underlying symmetries of functional space such as affine or more general .",
    "the solution has the multiscale / multiresolution decomposition via nonlinear high - localized eigenmodes , which corresponds to the full multiresolution expansion in all underlying time / phase space scales .",
    "starting from vlasov - poisson equations in part 2 , we consider the approach based on multiscale variational - wavelet formulation in part 3 .",
    "we give the explicit representation for all dynamical variables in the base of compactly supported wavelets or nonlinear eigenmodes .",
    "our solutions are parametrized by solutions of a number of reduced algebraical problems one from which is nonlinear with the same degree of nonlinearity as initial problem and the others are the linear problems which correspond to the particular method of calculations inside concrete wavelet scheme .",
    "because our approach started from variational formulation we can control evolution of instability on the pure algebraical level of reduced algebraical system of equations .",
    "this helps to control stability / unstability scenario of evolution in parameter space on pure algebraical level . in all these models numerical",
    "modeling demonstrates the appearance of coherent high - localized structures and as a result the stable patterns formation or unstable chaotic behaviour .",
    "analysis based on the non - linear vlasov equations leads to more clear understanding of collective effects and nonlinear beam dynamics of high intensity beam propagation in periodic - focusing and uniform - focusing transport systems .",
    "we consider the following form of equations ( ref .",

    "we obtain our multiscale / multiresolution representations for solutions of equations ( 3)-(8 ) via variational - wavelet approach .",
    "we decompose the solutions as @xmath8 where set @xmath9 corresponds to the coarsest level of resolution @xmath10 in the full multiresolution decomposition @xmath11 introducing detail space @xmath12 as the orthonormal complement of @xmath13 with respect to @xmath14 , we have for @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 @xmath19 from ( 9)-(11 ) : @xmath20 in some sense ( 9)-(11 ) is some generalization of the old @xmath0 approach [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] .",
    "let @xmath21 be an arbitrary ( non ) linear differential / integral operator with matrix dimension @xmath22 , which acts on some set of functions @xmath23 , @xmath24 from @xmath25 : @xmath26 ( @xmath17 are the generalized space coordinates or phase space coordinates , @xmath27 is `` time '' coordinate ) .",
    "after some anzatzes [ 3]-[17 ] the main reduced problem may be formulated as the system of ordinary differential equations @xmath28 or a set of such systems corresponding to each independent coordinate in phase space .",
    "they have the fixed initial ( or boundary ) conditions @xmath29 , where @xmath30 are not more than polynomial functions of dynamical variables @xmath31 and have arbitrary dependence on time . as result",
    "we have the following reduced algebraical system of equations on the set of unknown coefficients @xmath32 of localized eigenmode expansion ( formula ( 17 ) below ) : @xmath33 where operators l and m are algebraization of rhs and lhs of initial problem ( [ eq : pol0 ] ) and @xmath34 are unknowns of reduced system of algebraical equations ( rsae ) ( [ eq : pol2 ] ) .",
    "after solution of rsae ( [ eq : pol2 ] ) we determine the coefficients of wavelet expansion and therefore obtain the solution of our initial problem .",
    "it should be noted that if we consider only truncated expansion with n terms then we have from ( [ eq : pol2 ] ) the system of @xmath35 algebraical equations with degree @xmath36 and the degree of this algebraical system coincides with degree of initial differential system .",
    "so , we have the solution of the initial nonlinear ( rational ) problem in the form @xmath37 where coefficients @xmath32 are the roots of the corresponding reduced algebraical ( polynomial ) problem rsae ( [ eq : pol2 ] ) .",
    "consequently , we have a parametrization of solution of initial problem by the solution of reduced algebraical problem ( [ eq : pol2 ] ) .",
    "the obtained solutions are given in the form ( [ eq : pol3 ] ) , where @xmath38 are basis functions obtained via multiresolution expansions ( 9)-(11 ) , ( 13 ) and represented by some compactly supported wavelets . as a result the solution of equations ( 3)-(8 ) has the following multiscale / multiresolution decomposition via nonlinear high - localized eigenmodes , which corresponds to the full multiresolution expansion in all underlying scales ( 13 ) starting from coarsest one ( polynomial tensor bases are introduced in [ 17 ] ; @xmath39 ) : @xmath40                formula ( [ eq : z ] ) gives us expansion into the slow part @xmath41 and fast oscillating parts for arbitrary",
    "so , we may move from coarse scales of resolution to the finest one for obtaining more detailed information about our dynamical process .",
    "the first terms in the rhs of formulae ( 18 ) correspond on the global level of function space decomposition to resolution space and the second ones to detail space .",
    "it should be noted that such representations give the best possible localization properties in the corresponding ( phase)space / time coordinates .",
    "in contrast with different approaches formulae ( 18 ) do not use perturbation technique or linearization procedures .",
    "so , by using wavelet bases with their good ( phase ) space / time localization properties we can describe high - localized ( coherent ) structures in spatially - extended stochastic systems with collective behaviour .",
    "modelling demonstrates the appearance of stable patterns formation from high - localized coherent structures or chaotic behaviour . on fig",
    ".  1 we present contribution to the full expansion from coarsest level ( waveleton ) of decomposition ( 18 ) .",
    ", 3 show the representations for full solutions , constructed from the first 6 eigenmodes ( 6 levels in formula ( 18 ) ) , and demonstrate stable localized pattern formation and chaotic - like behaviour outside of kam region .",
    "we can control the type of behaviour on the level of reduced algebraical system ( 16 ) .",
