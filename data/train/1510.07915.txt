    "the ratio @xmath101 is about 40% higher than that in the fainter state .",
    "we find that the both our sources are outside of the ulx interval for @xmath101 : ngc5474 x-1 is below the range while m66 x-1 has a greater @xmath101 .",
    "if we compare the sources with agns , we find that absolute majority of agns have the ratio from 0.1 to 10 @xcite , in extreme cases of heavily obscured agns the ratio is approached @xmath102 @xcite .",
    "we may conclude that if a source has @xmath103 , it certainly must be a ulx .",
    "we do not have an optical luminosity of ngc5474 x-1 in its x - ray bright state .",
    "if its counterpart does not change notably the optical brightness ( as it is in other ulx counterparts ) , in the bright state the ratio will be @xmath10 .",
    "agns can not change their x - ray luminosities more than two orders of magnitude as we observed in ngc5474 x-1 .",
    "therefore , this source is obviously a ulx .",
    "it was suggested from x - ray and optical data @xcite that ulxs are super - eddington sources with stellar - mass black holes . if in standard accretion discs , the total luminosity is scaled with the mass accretion rate as @xmath104 , in the supercritical discs , it depends on black hole mass and is nearly independent of mass accretion rate , @xmath105 , where @xmath106erg s@xmath4 is the eddington luminosity , and @xmath107 corresponding mass accretion rate , @xmath108 is a black hole mass expressed in @xmath109 , and @xmath110 is the parameter accounting for advection ( poutanen et al .",
    "this is because the excess gas is expelled as a disc wind and the accreted gas is advected with the photon trapping , contributing little to the photon luminosity .",
    "the mass accretion rate can provide a factor of several in the logarithmic term .",
    "besides that , the funnel in the super - eddington disc wind will collimate the x - ray radiation to an observer also with a factor of a few , when observer may look at the funnel @xcite .",
    "thus , the apparent x - ray luminosity of a ulx with a stellar mass black hole may well be up to @xmath111 erg s@xmath4 .    in the super - eddington disc",
    "the ultraviolet / optical luminosity does depend stronger on the mass accretion rate , because the excess gas forms the wind reprocessing the disc x - ray radiation .",
    "@xcite have found that the ulx optical counterparts have very hot winds resembling wnl - type stars and their optical spectra are also very similar to that of ss433 . using simple relations for the supercritical discs",
    ", they found that the optical luminosity of such discs is @xmath112 because the stronger wind will reprocess more radiation emerging in the disc funnel .",
    "we may conclude therefore that these two sources ngc5474 x-1 and m66 x-1 do belong to the ulx - type , and their high @xmath101 ratios are determined as usual for ulxs x - ray luminosity , but a lower optical luminosity .",
    "this large ratio may be due to faint donor stars and it is quite possible that their optical emission might arise from these stars . taking into account the colour and magnitude of the optical counterparts , they may represent f - g - type stars .",
    "their optical luminosities might be also explained by lower ( but nevertheless supercritical ) mass accretion rates in these systems .",
    "they could be compared with the most dim ulxs in optical such as m81 x-6 or ngc1313 x-1 whose x - ray - to - optical luminosities are @xmath113 .",

    "<S> we find that these two ulxs have largest x - ray - to - optical ratios of @xmath10 for ngc5474 x-1 ( in its bright state ) and 8000 for m66 x-1 both with the faintest optical counterparts ever measured . </S>",
    "<S> probably their optical emission originates from the donor star . </S>",
