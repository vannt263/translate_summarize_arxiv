    "after the upgrade of the hera machine longitudinally polarised lepton beams were available to the hermes , the h1 and the zeus experiment .",
    "the degree of polarisation was measured for nearly all available data with two independent polarimeters , the transverse polarimeter tpol , located close to the hera - west interaction point , and the longitudinal polarimeter lpol , located close to the hera - east interaction point . throughout the hera ii running period from fall 2003 to mid 2007 typically @xmath2 of the integrated luminosity used in polarisation dependent analyses of the experiments",
    "is covered by at least one polarimeter @xcite .",
    "in addition , for some part of data in 2006 and 2007 , a new polarimeter was used in place of the longitudinal polarimeter , the cavity polarimeter .",
    "the analysis of data from this instrument is covered in @xcite , and is not included in this note .    in this report the analyses of the transverse and",
    "the longitudinal polarimeters are presented . for the transverse polarimeter",
    ", a completely new analysis method has been developed and is presented , while for the lpol an in - depth evaluation of the systematic errors has been performed .",
    "this is followed by a recommendation on how to treat the errors of the polarimeters and how to combine the data from the two devices to obtain one hera ii polarisation measurement .",
    "the main method of the analysis of the lpol has been unchanged for a number of years . the main focus of the work presented in this note",
    "has been a careful re - evaluation of the systematic errors as published in @xcite .",
    "studies were undertaken to understand the behaviour of key parameters in more detail .",
    "extensive searches have been conducted to look for correlations between variables in the lpol and the lpol/ tpol ratio , to understand potential sources of discrepancy between the two devices . to this end",
    "the data of the lpol have been restructured for easier access , and additional variables have been included in the database  @xcite .",
    "the values of systematic uncertainties are given in tab .",
    "[ tab : lpol ] .",
    "._[tab : lpol ] systematic ( relative ) uncertainties of the lpol measurements .",
    "the so - called hera i contributions are described in @xcite .",
    "the extra contribution to the error is estimated from the studies in @xcite , and should be applied to the lpol values measured from july @xmath3 2004 onwards , after the replacement of the cracked calorimeter crystals .",
    "the table is adapted from @xcite .",
    "the third column indicates the estimated class of systematic error and possible period dependence , see sect .",
    "[ sec : class ] for details . _ [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     when applying the suggested averaging procedure to the complete set of hera ii polarimeter data using equal contributing integrated luminosity values @xmath4 for every 5 minute bucket as described in sect .",
    "[ sect : avgproc ] , enumeration point 2 , the contributions of systematic uncertainty for the four running periods with either electrons or positrons and left or right handed polarisation can be estimated .",
    "the results are shown in tab .",
    "[ tab : avgresults ] . following this estimation",
    "the total systematic uncertainty , calculated by adding the three systematic contributions in quadrature , is for all four periods @xmath5 and for the positron run periods even @xmath6 .",
    "these estimated results are for illustration only .",
    "it is expected that the precise results will vary somewhat for the experiments as their integrated luminosities and data selection cuts need to be taken into account properly .",
    "we are grateful to p.  schler and v.  gharibyan as well as all members of the pol2000 group for their support and discussions . the support of the h1 , hermes and zeus experiments is warmly acknowledged .",
    "we thank the hera machine group whose outstanding efforts have made this experiment possible and the desy directorate for its support .",
    "we thank also m.  voigt and d.  p.  barber for discussions and j.  list for technical help ."
