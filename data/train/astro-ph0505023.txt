    "gravitational waves from coalescing compact binaries composed of neutron stars or black holes are the most promising targets for ground - based as well as space - based detectors . by applying the matched filtering technique which uses our theoretical predictions of wave forms obtained by the post - newtonian computations , we can extract the binary parameters such as the masses of each compact object , distance to the source , spatial positions of the source and so on @xcite .",
    "one possibility which alters the predicted wave forms calculated with high precision is the gravitational lensing of gravitational waves . if a massive object lies suitably between the source and the observer , gravitational lensing of gravitational waves occurs .",
    "one important point is that since the wavelength of gravitational waves we are interested in is much larger than that of light , a situation where the geometrical optics approximation breaks down can be realized in some cases .",
    "as is discussed by many authors @xcite , if the wavelength is larger than the schwarzschild radius of the lens object , the diffraction effect becomes important and the magnification approaches to unity .",
    "therefore we must use wave optics rather than the geometric optics for @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a mass of the lens and @xmath2 is the frequency of the gravitational waves .",
    "this frequency ( mhz ) is the case for the planned detector lisa  @xcite .",
    "further because the gravitational waves from a compact binary are coherent , interference between lensed waves is important . note that this situation is not in general realized in the case of gravitational lensing of electro - magnetic wave such as visible light .",
    "since light is emitted from microscopic region ( usually atomic size ) which is much smaller than the size of the source , each phase of the electro - magnetic wave emitted from different points has no correlation and thus interference effect vanishes .",
    "if we assume the coalescence of smbhs of mass @xmath3 as the source of the gravitational waves , it can be detected even if the sources are located at the cosmological distance ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "event rate of smbh - smbh merger for lisa is estimated as @xmath5 @xcite and lensing probability becomes several percent .",
    "hence , some lensing events per year will be detected by lisa .",
    "motivated by the fact that wave effects can be detected for the gravitational lensing of gravitational waves , there are now growing interests in the wave optics in gravitational lensing @xcite",
    ". however we have to solve wave equation which is generally partial differential equation between the source and the observer in order to obtain the lensed wave form at the observer . except for a few special cases ,",
    "exact solutions of wave equation are not known at present .",
    "several authors have used thin lens approximation which reduces wave equation to double integral for single lens object ( for multi - lens objects , integration becomes multi - integral , see @xcite ) and thus makes the problem easier @xcite . in geometric optics the trajectory of light ray is obtained by solving geodesic equation , and it is known that thin lens approximation is valid @xcite .",
    "however there has been no studies or comments about the validity of the thin lens approximation in the framework of wave optics .    in this paper",
    ", we develop a formulation to solve the wave equation for a spherically symmetric lens , where a partial differential equation reduces to a set of ordinary differential equations .",
    "we also solve those equations for simple lens models : the uniform density sphere , the singular isothermal sphere and the hernquist model and evaluate the error of the thin lens approximation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we briefly review wave optics in gravitational lensing under the thin lens approximation . in section iii ,",
    "we develop a formalulation to solve the scattering problem of gravitational waves by a lens . in section iv , we present our numerical results and discuss the validity of the thin lens approximation .",

    "we use unit of @xmath6 .",
    "we consider the wave propagation under the gravitational fields of a lens .",
    "we assume that the spacetime metric is a minkowski spacetime plus a small perturbation due to the existence of a static lensing object .",
    "then the metric can be written as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a newtonian potential of the lensing object .",
    "we consider a propagation of scalar waves @xmath9 , instead of gravitational waves , since the wave equation for @xmath9 is the same as that for gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "the scalar wave equation , @xmath10 , with the metric ( [ tla1 ] ) is rewritten as @xmath11 where we assume that the wave is monochromatic with the angular frequency @xmath12 .",
    "the above equation was solved by using the kirchhoff diffraction integral ( see @xcite , sec.4.7 and 7 ) under the thin lens approximation .     with @xmath13 .",

    "the two dimensional potential @xmath22 in @xmath19 plane is defined as @xmath23 here , @xmath24 is also obtained from the surface density by using @xmath25 .",

    "in this section , we develop a formulation to solve the scattering problem of gravitational waves by lensing object which is applicable to the case where the lens potential is spherically symmetric . a situation we will consider is that plane wave is entering weak gravitational field which is spherically symmetric . when the lensing object is spherically symmetric , a scattering problem can be reduced to a problem of determining so - called phase shift which is used to probe the nature of nuclear physics and is also useful for the scattering by bhs where the assumption of weak gravitational field breaks down @xcite .",

    "this result shows that the thin lens approximation is valid for the wavelength where we can use geometric optics instead of wave optics .",
    "the reason why thin lens approximation becomes valid in the geometric optics is that the deflection angle can be evaluated by using the thin lens potential if the distance between lens and observer is much larger than the lens size ( see ref.@xcite , p.124 ) . for this panel too , @xmath85 remains smaller than @xmath88 in all range of frequencies of calculation .",

    "we find that @xmath85 becomes maximum at close to @xmath92 and decreases as @xmath80 becomes larger .",

    "[ fig3 ] ) , the size effect of lens becomes negligible and the lensed waveform becomes the same as for the point mass lens for which it is known that thin lens approximation is valid .",
    "except for a small region of @xmath80 around where @xmath85 takes maximum value , @xmath85 is smaller than @xmath88 .    to summarize , for the uniform density sphere , the relative error of the amplification factor in the thin lens approximation is suppressed within the ratio of its radius to distance @xmath95 , which is much smaller than unity in a realistic astrophysical situations and is the largest for @xmath96 ( @xmath97 is the wavelength ) .",
