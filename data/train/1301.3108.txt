    ", we can consider two main raman mechanisms with high scattering probabilities .",
    "both mechanisms are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig15](b ) and noted in table  [ taboverview ] .    *",
    "_ exciton only_. this mechanism does not involve resident carriers , only the electron and hole in the exciton .",
    "after @xmath17 excitation , the @xmath203 exciton state is populated .",
    "the electron spin - flip accompanied with the emission of an acoustic phonon scatters the bright exciton to the @xmath204 state thus resulting in a raman shift of @xmath205 .",
    "the exciton exchange energy @xmath206 will not contribute if the hole spin - relaxation time @xmath207 is very short , i.e. , @xmath208 , so that the criterion suggested by dyakonov et al . is fulfilled  @xcite .",
    "the fast hole relaxation mixes the hole states @xmath184 and @xmath138 , therefore , the exciton state @xmath204 can recombine with emission of @xmath12 polarized light .",
    "the criterion @xmath208 is easy to fulfill in the voigt geometry when the larmor frequency of the heavy - hole is low due to the small transverse component of its @xmath2 factor . to satisfy this criterion for the faraday geometry and high magnetic fields ( @xmath209  t )",
    "the spin relaxation time should be below @xmath210  ps . however , this is significantly shorter than the hole spin - dephasing time of about @xmath211  ps measured for the sample studied  @xcite .",
    "+ this mechanism is also in agreement with the strong difference between the e - sf intensities in faraday and voigt geometries which can be explained by the role of magnetic localization being stronger in the faraday geometry . if we account for the hh - lh mixing in the studied qw with @xmath212 , the expected ratios of the different polarization configurations @xmath213 for ( @xmath197):(@xmath198):(@xmath199):(@xmath200 ) are close to the experimentally determined ratios .",
    "+ the sfrs sensitivity to the illumination can be attributed to the exciton lifetime , which is limited by the exciton capture into trion . here",
    ", we can expect a nonmonotonic dependence of the e - sf intensity on the major type of resident carrier changing from the p - type to the n - type regime , with a maximum for an empty qw .",
    "it is similar to the dependence in fig .",
    "[ fig9](b ) shown by triangles .",
    "+ the temperature dependence in this case can be explained by the exciton localization .",
    "it avoids to care about the conservation of the light wave vector , which is necessary for free excitons . * _ only exciton + anisotropic exchange in exciton_. this mechanism consists of the e - sf via acoustic phonon scattering and anisotropic exchange between the electron and hole in the exciton .",
    "the exchange interaction , which leaves the electron spin invariant but changes the hole spin , is efficient in faraday geometry due to similar electron and hole @xmath2 factors ( see subsec .",
    "[ exch_int ] ) as well as spatially shifted hole and electron localization centers in the qw plane .",
    "this anisotropic flip - stop - like exchange interaction promotes the hole into a virtual state whose energy corresponds to the energy of the initial hole state .",
    "the virtual state is not an eigenstate of the exciton , but serves as an intermediate state in the coherent raman scattering process .",
    "accordingly , only the energy of the electron zeeman splitting contributes to the raman shift in agreement with the experimental results .",
    "the admixture of light - hole to heavy - hole states explains all polarization properties of the observed e - sf line . in comparison to model ( 1 ) ,",
    "the probability of the whole scattering mechanism is reduced , since the additional anisotropic e - h exchange makes it to a fourth - order raman process .    both processes",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are considered as valuable candidates for explaining the e - sf at the exciton resonance .",
    "the observed strong decrease in the e - sf intensity ( contrary to expectation ) with increasing angle between the magnetic field and qw growth direction rather supports model ( 2 ) .",
    "indeed , both models predict an enhancement of the e - sf efficiency with the tilting angle ( @xmath214 ) due to mixing of the spin - up and spin - down states by the transverse component of the magnetic field .",
    "however , only model ( 2 ) includes the competition between the above mentioned effect and the angular dependent strength of the anisotropic exchange interaction .",
    "the efficiency of the anisotropic exchange in the exciton decreases with growing angle owing to the progressively increasing mismatch between the electron and hole @xmath2 factors , see eq .",
    "( [ intvsangl ] ) . on the whole , both e - sfrs models are supposed to take place for resonant excitation of the exciton . in tilted geometries , for both models",
    "the light polarization characteristics are modified by the electron - state mixing .",
    "an e - sfrs process of second order is not allowed by the mixed electron states in the case of a two carrier complex ( exciton ) .",
    "note , the efficient mechanisms ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) can also serve as strong competitors for the flip of the exciton spin , which could be visible in titled geometries but was not detected .",
    "the reason for that can be its probability being lower than that of the previously described mechanisms which conceal the exciton - sfrs .",
    "let us discuss other mechanisms leading to the observation of e - sfrs for the resonance excitation of the exciton .",
    "* _ exciton + resident electron , third - order process_. in contrast to model ( 1 ) , the electron spin - flip is provided by isotropic exchange with a resident electron . in accordance with case",
    "( 1 ) , this mechanism assumes fast hole spin relaxation giving rise to a third - order raman process whose probability is highest in cross - polarization .",
    "although it is similar to the first mechanism , it can be distinguished through specific polarization properties when the resident electron is polarized by the external magnetic field . such resident electron polarization in a magnetic field changes the stokes / anti - stokes ratio of the e - sf line intensities measured in co - polarized configurations  @xcite .",
    "this ratio is then not only defined by a temperature factor , but also by the electron spin polarization .",
    "for instance , the e - sf line for the ( @xmath185 ) configuration might be visible only in the stokes region , and in anti - stokes for ( @xmath215 ) .",
    "however , such polarization changes were not found for the e - sf line , while the applied magnetic fields were strong enough to polarize resident electrons .",
    "therefore , we conclude that this mechanism is not relevant .",
    "* _ analog of exciton + resident hole_. another third - order mechanism is based on anisotropic exchange interaction between the photogenerated and a resident electron , by analogy with fig .",
    "[ fig15](a ) .",
    "this mechanism is valid for the low - symmetry complex of a resident electron bound to the photo - exciton , where both electron wave functions are displaced .",
    "since only the resident electron spin is changed , while the one of the photo - electron stays invariant , the process is allowed in co - polarized configurations and can not explain the experiment for the e - sfrs .",
    "the models ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) based on third - order processes , which have rather high scattering probabilities , predict properties of the e - sf in the exciton which are contradictory to the experimental results .",
    "accordingly , they can be discarded , and only the models ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are in reasonable agreement with the experiment .      the enhancement of the e - sf intensity by the above - barrier illumination can be explained by an increase in the exciton lifetime . as shown by koudinov et al .",
    "@xcite , the sfrs intensity depends on the third power of the exciton lifetime @xmath216 or , respectively , the line width of the exciton state . due to the background concentration of holes",
    "the excitons can become trapped in positive trion states .",
    "this trion formation is the dominant nonradiative decay mechanism for excitons .",
    "its formation time @xmath217 is about a few ps depending on the resident carrier concentration , while the exciton lifetime approaches 30  ps .",
    "hence , the line width of the exciton will be broadened and , in turn , the sfrs intensity decreases .",
    "the illumination leads to a reduction in the resident hole concentration thus making the formation of positive trions less probable .",
    "correspondingly , the lifetime of the exciton states is increased resulting in a rise in the overall electron - sfrs intensity .",
    "this rise requires that the scattering time @xmath218 of the acoustic phonon and spin - spin exchange exceeds the trion formation time , and the entire e - sfrs must occur within the exciton lifetime : @xmath219 . at high power densities of the illumination",
    "the sfrs intensity will be reduced again , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig9](b ) .",
    "note that the trion formation time and/or exciton lifetime only influence the sfrs intensity , while the width of the sfrs line is affected by @xmath218 .",
    "the spin - flip raman scattering of electrons and heavy - holes has been studied for resonant excitation of neutral and charged excitons in a cdte / cd@xmath0mg@xmath1te quantum well . for neutral excitons sfrs models taking into account high - symmetry potential",
    "predict the flip of the exciton spin via acoustic phonon interaction in every geometry . a single spin - flip of either the electron or heavy - hole is forbidden by selection rules in the electric - dipole approximation .",
    "however , in the raman spectra measured only the single spin - flips are observed . for the heavy - hole - sf ,",
    "the anisotropic flip - stop - like exchange interaction between the heavy - hole in the exciton and a neighbored heavy - hole comes into consideration as scattering mechanism .",
    "due to spatially mismatched wave functions of both holes in the qw plane , reflecting a reduced qw potential symmetry , the anisotropic exchange is possible .",
    "hereby , only the resident heavy - hole spin state is changed giving rise to a raman shift corresponding to @xmath220 .",
    "the electron spin - flip scattering in the neutral exciton is provided by two mechanisms .",
    "they shall describe the three main features of the e - sf derived from experiment : its strong intensity in crossed polarization configuration , intensity enhancement with increasing magnetic field in faraday geometry , and a decrease in intensity by going from faraday to voigt geometry . in both mechanisms ,",
    "the electron spin is flipped via acoustic phonon interaction . in order to explain the crossed polarization , model ( 1 ) assumes a fast hole spin relaxation , and model ( 2 ) supposes an anisotropic electron - hole exchange interaction .",
    "the first model is of lower scattering order , hence , its probability is higher than that of the second model .",
    "but , model ( 1 ) requires a fast hole spin relaxation , and can not describe the e - sf intensity reduction with increasing tilting angle , in contrast to model ( 2 ) .",
    "here , the anisotropic exchange interaction looses its strength due to the increasing difference between the electron and heavy - hole larmor frequencies with growing angle .",
    "the intensity enhancement with magnetic field strength is attributed to a stronger magnetic localization giving rise to larger spin dephasing and life times of the exciton .",
    "the circular polarization characteristics of the sfrs lines are fully described in consideration of light - heavy - hole mixing , inherently induced by local qw deformation and asymmetric interface potential .    for positively and negatively charged excitons ,",
    "the simultaneous spin - flips of electron and heavy - hole are expected from the sfrs models in faraday geometry . nevertheless , only an e - sf for the t@xmath34 trion is observed .",
    "it is based on anisotropic electron - heavy - hole exchange interaction , which opens the outgoing scattering channel for circularly polarized recombination . in tilted geometry ,",
    "the models allow electron - sf in t@xmath34 trion and heavy - hole - sf in t@xmath33 trion due to field - induced electron - state mixing .",
    "these efficient raman processes of second order are confirmed by experiment .",
    "in the two - color sfrs measurements with resonant excitation of exciton complexes and above - barrier illumination , we have shown that the intensity of the electron - sfrs can be considerably enhanced by moderate illumination power densities .",
    "too high power densities lead to reduction in the exciton lifetime and delocalization of resident electrons . from the temperature dependences of the sfrs lines , the deactivation energies of the corresponding spin - flip raman processes have been evaluated .",
    "they are strongly connected to the localization energies of the respective exciton complexes . besides the lifetime of the exciton complex under study , also the localization degree of the carrier involved in the scattering process control the sfrs efficiency .",
    "we have demonstrated that the spin - flip raman scattering gives valuable information not only about the electron and heavy - hole @xmath2 factor tensors , but particularly about the spin - flip scattering mechanisms being present in neutral and charged exciton complexes . besides the dependence of the spin - flip scattering mechanisms on the strength of the magnetic field , lattice temperature and laser power , especially the geometry of experiment , the polarization properties of the incident and scattered light as well as the excitation energy are crucial parameters to observe and characterize sfrs processes .",
