    "clinical trials are much more complex than typical statistical designs may indicate . an example is a phase  i stem cell transplantation ( sct ) trial in which the continual reassessment method ( crm , oquigley , pepe and fisher , @xcite ; oquigley , @xcite ) was applied to optimize the per - administration dose ( pad ) of gemcitabine , @xmath0 when added to an established two - agent preparative regimen consisting of intravenous busulfan and melphalan ( andersson et al . , @xcite ) . the design was used for each of two separate , parallel trials , one for allogeneic transplant ( allotx ) , which uses stem cells from a matched donor , and one for autologous transplant ( autotx ) , which uses the patient s own stem cells . for each patient , during the period from day @xmath110 to day @xmath11 preceding the sct on day 0 , each of the three agents was given on two or more days using a particular schedule and pad .",
    "previously , a six - day schedule of additional gemcitabine had been tried , but it was found to be too toxic , so in this trial each patient s assigned @xmath2 was given in a two - day schedule , on each of days @xmath18 and @xmath13 , for total gemcitabine dose @xmath3 .",
    "`` toxicity '' was defined to be any regimen - related grade 4 or 5 adverse event ( ae ) occurring within 30 days post transplant and affecting a vital organ , but excluding aes that occur routinely in sct , such as marrow suppression and , in allotx , graft - versus - host disease ( gvhd ) . using the usual crm criterion , the design s nominal goal was to find @xmath2 from a predetermined set of 10 pads ranging from 225 to 3675 mg@xmath4m@xmath5 having toxicity probability , @xmath6 with posterior mean @xmath7 closest to the target 0.10 , where @xmath8 denotes the model parameters . the principal investigator ( pi )",
    "specified the conservatively low target 0.10 in part due to the previous negative experience with the six - day schedule , and also because 0.10 is consistent with the toxicity rate of the established two - agent regimen . in each subgroup ,",
    "gemcitabine doses were to be chosen for successive cohorts of 3 patients , up to a maximum of 36 patients , with the safety rules that no untried dose could be skipped when escalating and accrual to the subgroup would be stopped if the lowest dose @xmath9 was unacceptably toxic , formally if @xmath10 .",
    "because clinical trials are medical experiments with human subjects , they often do not play out precisely as designed .",
    "in the course of this trial : ( i ) when no toxicity was seen in the first 24 patients the pi decided to change the two - day gemcitabine schedule ( @xmath11 ) to the three - day schedule ( @xmath12 ) while maintaining the same total dose by giving @xmath13 on each day , ( ii )  this three - day schedule was quickly found to cause severe skin toxicity in the first few patients who received it and accrual was suspended , and ( iii ) we re - designed the trial again by returning to the two - day schedule , but ( iv ) at the pi s request we also expanded the set of possible @xmath2 values . after 28 allotx patients had been treated and fully evaluated , however , ( v ) concern about observed grade 3 mucositis and skin toxicities seen at higher dose levels caused the physicians to expand the definition of `` toxicity '' to include these events , which previously had been excluded if they could be resolved therapeutically within two weeks . along with this change",
    ", they also decided to change the crm target from 0.10 to 0.15 .",
    "these last changes had the combined effect of substantially increasing the numbers of patients with `` toxicity '' among those treated at higher dose levels and greatly reducing the value of @xmath2 recommended by the crm . per standard regulatory procedure , it was necessary to obtain institutional review board approval for each change in the design .",
    "so , this trial actually was designed five times , it evaluated effects of a combination of three agents given in overlapping pre - transplant schedules , both the dose and schedule of gemcitabine were varied adaptively during the trial using three different formulations of the crm to choose gemcitabine pads and ad hoc decisions for changing schedules , there were two simultaneous trials involving different sct modalities , the dominant effects on toxicity were both @xmath2 and the schedule of gemcitabine , and the definition of toxicity was changed near the end of the trial to be more inclusive and thus obtain a more protective dose selection criterion . overshadowing all of this were the actual goals , which were not only to control toxicity but also to reduce the rate and severity of gvhd in the allotx patients and to improve the rates of engraftment and 100-day survival , compared to the established preparative regimen .",
    "denote the treatment administered to a given patient by @xmath14 . in the designs discussed here",
    ", @xmath14 will be the dose of an agent , the dose pair of two agents given together , or a ( schedule , dose ) combination consisting of a finite sequence of administration times and corresponding doses . actual patient outcome in oncology trials is very complex , often including numerous different types of toxicity scored on ordinal scales of severity ( grade ) , disease status scored as a binary or ordinal variable , with each often recorded at several successive evaluations , as well as the times of delay or discontinuation of treatment , drop - out or death .",
    "in sharp contrast , the outcome @xmath15 used for statistical decision - making during the trial usually is defined to be a single variable or possibly a  vector of two variables . in the examples given here ,",
    "the designs assume that @xmath15 is , respectively , a single binary toxicity indicator , a  vector of two binary indicators of toxicity and efficacy , a vector of ordinal toxicities or a time - to - toxicity variable subject to right censoring .",
    "the model consists of a probability density function ( p.d.f . ) or mass function ( p.m.f . ) @xmath16 of @xmath15 for a patient who receives treatment @xmath14 , and a prior @xmath17 , where @xmath8 is the model parameter vector and @xmath18 are fixed hyperparameters .",
    "the data observed from the first @xmath19 patients in the trial are @xmath20 with likelihood @xmath21 and posterior @xmath22    all of the designs that i will discuss here utilize bayesian `` learn - as - you - go '' decision rules to choose @xmath14 from the set of possible treatments , @xmath23 , based on the posterior @xmath24 computed from the most recent data available when a new patient is enrolled .",
    "such a sequentially adaptive decision algorithm may be expressed as a sequence @xmath25 of functions @xmath26 where @xmath27 denotes the empty set and @xmath28 means `` do not treat with any @xmath29 . '' in general , @xmath30 may include several adaptive decision rules used together , such as rules for choosing a dose , a dose pair or a ( schedule , dose ) combination , for temporarily suspending accrual to wait for additional data on previously treated patients , or for stopping the trial early because no @xmath31 is acceptable .",
    "the @xmath32st iteration of the bayesian medical decision - making process may be described by the sequence of mappings @xmath33\\\\[-8pt ] & \\longrightarrow & y_{n+1 } \\longrightarrow   \\mathcal{d}_{n+1}\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which bayes theorem uses the assumed probability model @xmath34 to map the observed data into a posterior , the decision rules @xmath35 use this to choose the next treatment @xmath36 , the patient is treated , the outcome @xmath37 is observed , and @xmath38 are incorporated into the data .",
    "this process is repeated until the end of the trial , which may be when either a maximum sample size @xmath39 or trial duration @xmath40 is reached , or because the trial is stopped early .",
    "the process whereby the expanding data set is used by applying bayes theorem repeatedly to turn @xmath41 into @xmath42 may be called `` iterative bayesian learning , '' in that one learns about @xmath8 as additional data are observed during the trial . in the sequel , to simplify notation i will suppress dependence of the posterior on the prior hyperparameters @xmath18 .",
    "a design consists of the trial s entry criteria , treatments @xmath43 set of possible patient outcomes , probability model @xmath44 , decision rules @xmath45 @xmath39 or @xmath40 , and possibly a cohort size , @xmath46 . since @xmath35 acts on @xmath47 indirectly through @xmath24 in bayesian adaptive designs , evaluation of a design s properties must account for the fact that @xmath48 is a sequence of statistics .",
    "the complexity of the process summarized by ( @xmath49 ) , even for binary @xmath15 and a single dose @xmath14 , has motivated the routine use of computer simulation under each of a set of assumed `` true '' @xmath50 as a tool to evaluate the frequentist operating characteristics ( ocs ) of the design for various @xmath51 s .",
    "this is used as a basis for choosing decision rules , calibrating design parameters , and possibly calibrating the prior .",
    "there is nothing `` non - bayesian '' about using frequentist ocs of a bayesian design to adjust the prior and design parameters . on the contrary , because simulating a trial that is based on a bayesian design allows the physician to better understand the consequences of particular prior values , simulation provides a tool for the physician to modify his / her prior so that it more accurately reflects what the physician actually believes .",
    "it also is important to examine the prior s properties in the natural parameter domain , such as the probability of toxicity at dose @xmath14 , @xmath52 , rather than in terms of elements of @xmath8 that may have no intuitive meaning to a physician .",
    "one should also examine the first few decisions @xmath35 for each of several possible configurations of data , in order to avoid a prior that does not make sense .",
    "this is especially important for evaluating decisions that must be made early in the trial based on very little data , such as choosing the second cohort s dose based on data from the first cohort of three patients .",
    "the prior always has consequences in an early phase trial , regardless of how `` uninformative '' it may appear to be .",
    "if one does not wish to use simulation as a design tool , the most common alternative approach is to first specify a formal optimality criterion and solve for @xmath51 mathematically ( cf .",
    "haines , perevozskaya and rosenberger , @xcite ; dette et al . , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the simulation - based ocs of a design obtained using a particular optimality criterion are often surprising , essentially because such a design s properties are a consequence of the optimality criterion used .",
    "one may information , minimize the variance of a particular estimated quantity , minimize mean or maximum sample size , control false positive or other incorrect decision probabilities , minimize expected financial costs , minimize expected trial duration , optimize outcomes for patients in the trial or for future patients , etc .",
    "since , unavoidably , such goals often are at odds with each other , use of the word `` optimal '' without qualification may be very misleading .",
    "actual clinical trial logistics can be quite complex . while the crm adaptively chooses a new dose from a continuum for each new patient , goodman , zahurak and piantadosi ( @xcite ) proposed the practical modifications of choosing doses for successive cohorts of several patients and limiting doses to a finite set . in most of the outcome",
    "adaptive dose - finding applications that i have seen , each newly chosen @xmath14 is given to a cohort .",
    "moreover , a `` do not skip '' safety rule often is imposed that does not allow an untried dose to be skipped when escalating .",
    "while limiting doses to a finite set of discrete values usually does not allow the exact mtd to be chosen , the difference between the chosen dose and the true mtd may be small , provided that the chosen sizes doses are reasonable .",
    "for example , using the dose set \\{100 , 200 , 400 , 800 , 1600 } must miss an actual mtd of 600 by at least 200 , which is larger than the difference between the first two doses .",
    "moreover , escalation from 400 to 800 or from 800 to 1600 may be unsafe , regardless of whether a do - not - skip rule is imposed .",
    "for example , if a cohort size @xmath53 is used , then @xmath35 chooses @xmath54 and , formally , @xmath55 and @xmath56 all must be observed before updating the data and making the next decision .",
    "however , if @xmath37 has been fully evaluated at the time patient @xmath57 is accrued , then @xmath58 may be chosen more reliably by applying the decision criterion based on the updated posterior incorporating the data @xmath59 from patient @xmath60 ; similarly , if @xmath37 and @xmath61 are known when patient @xmath62 is accrued , their data may be included to choose @xmath63 .",
    "a simple approach that works surprisingly well is to use the `` look ahead '' rule : if the possible outcomes of treated patients for whom @xmath15 has not yet been fully evaluated will not alter the chosen  @xmath14 for the next patient , then treat the next patient with  @xmath14 without delay ( thall et al . , @xcite )",
    "this is closely related to the general fact that the time window required to evaluate @xmath15 per its definition and the accrual rate together play critically important roles in trial conduct .",
    "for example , if @xmath64 ( toxicity within 3 months from start of therapy ) and the accrual rate is 6 patients per month , then any outcome - adaptive rule based on @xmath65 is virtually useless , since a large number of patients will be treated before the rule may be applied . some possible ways to implement an outcome - adaptive design in such settings are as follows : ( i ) use @xmath66 but enroll only a very small proportion of eligible patients in the trial , ( ii ) use @xmath53 or larger with accrual suspended between cohorts , but use the look - ahead rule to improve logistical feasibility , or ( iii ) redefine the outcome to be time - to - toxicity , but use a safety rule that may delay accrual interimly to allow the data from previously treated patients to mature ( cf .",

    "@xcite ) .",
    "at the start of the trial , when @xmath67 , the first treatment @xmath68 may be chosen by applying the decision rule @xmath69 based on the prior @xmath17 .",
    "methods for choosing a starting dose have been proposed by goodman , zahurak and piantadosi ( @xcite ) and cheung ( @xcite ) .",
    "most commonly , @xmath68 is chosen by the physician based on the nature of @xmath14 , the definition of @xmath15 , the trial s entry criteria and clinical experience treating the disease .",
    "for example , a trial enrolling prostate cancer patients with a life expectancy of six years is very different from a trial enrolling brain tumor patients with a life expectancy of six months .",
    "similarly , depending on the trial s entry criteria and treatment , `` toxicity '' may be defined as anything from severe fatigue to regimen - related death .",
    "it thus makes sense , during the prior elicitation process , to calibrate @xmath70 so that @xmath69 agrees with the physician s @xmath68 , since the motivation for choosing a particular @xmath68 is based on prior experience .    in this paper",
    "i will review several designs that focus on the problem of reflecting more fully particular complexities of @xmath71 .",
    "each design addresses some , but not all , of the issues in the sct trial described earlier .",
    "these methods were motivated by problems that i  have encountered during the process of designing early phase trials over the past 19 years .",
    "each design was developed by a collaborative team including one or more physicians , one or more statisticians and a computer programmer .",
    "each may be called a `` phase  i '' design in that dose - finding is based on toxicity , or a `` phase i / ii '' design in that dose - finding is based on both efficacy and toxicity , with the exception of the design described in section  [ sec5 ] that jointly optimizes schedule and dose ( braun et al . , @xcite ) . while it is tempting to think that a `` one - size - fits - all '' design encompassing all phase i / ii possibilities may be constructed , in my experience clinical research",
    "is far too complex to do this , and each new trial design problem often has unique aspects that require a new model or method . the particular data structure , probability model and decision rules that should be used to design a clinical trial are best determined through careful discussion with the physicians planning the trial , and must strike a compromise between the desire to accurately reflect the medical process and address scientific goals while accommodating the practical realities of trial conduct .",
    "i will not discuss methods for eliciting and calibrating priors , since this topic could easily fill an additional manuscript .",
    "i will not explore the ethical aspects of adaptive decision rules either , since they also are quite complex ( cf .",
    "palmer , @xcite ) .",
    "early phase trial design and conduct are difficult and complicated in large part due to the tension between optimizing the benefit and safety of patients treated in the trial , and learning about the effects of each @xmath14 on @xmath15 to benefit future patients , as well as economic constraints and regulatory requirements . in this regard , a statistician constructing",

    "tmml assume that there is clinical experience with each single agent when used alone , since this often is a requirement before investigating a combination in humans .",
    "since @xmath88 parameterizes @xmath89 for @xmath90 and @xmath91 parameterizes interaction between the two agents , a key element of tmml s approach is that the priors @xmath92 and @xmath93 are informative while @xmath94 is vague . assuming gamma priors on the elements of @xmath8 for tractability , tmml provide a detailed algorithm for eliciting @xmath92 and @xmath93 ,",
    "although if historical data are available , the posteriors from preliminary fits of such data may be used as these priors for trial design and conduct .",
    "considering @xmath80 geometrically as a response surface over the domain @xmath95 ^ 2 $ ] , this says that there is substantial prior knowledge about each of the two lines @xmath96 and @xmath97 on the edges of the response surface , but otherwise little is known about the surface , so it is like a sheet tied down at two edges but otherwise varying freely . in particular , the meaning of @xmath98 in the model @xmath99 is very different from its meaning in the submodel @xmath100 .",
    "this is underscored by the prior effective sample sizes computed by morita , thall and mueller ( @xcite ) for the gamma priors given by tmml ( @xcite , section 3 ) , which are 547.3 for @xmath101 , 756.8 for @xmath102 , 0.01 for @xmath103 and 1.5 for @xmath17 .",
    "this says that , with respect to toxicity , a priori a lot is known about how each agent behaves when used alone , but almost nothing is known about how the two agents behave together .    .",
    "]      the dose - finding method exploits the following geometric structure on @xmath104 ^ 2 $ ] . for each @xmath105 ,",
    "the set @xmath106 is the isocontour of all dose pairs having toxicity probability @xmath107 .",

    "the design proceeds in two stages . in stage 1 , doses are chosen for successive cohorts from a finite set of values on the predetermined fixed diagonal line @xmath116 shown as the straight line at approximately 45@xmath117 in figure  [ fig1 ] . the design is robust to the particular angle of @xmath118 , as long as it is not too far from 45@xmath117 . since the response surface @xmath80 increases in each argument @xmath68 and @xmath86 , @xmath80 must increase as @xmath14 moves up @xmath118 from lower left to upper right .",
    "given target toxicity probability @xmath119 , dose - finding in stage 1 proceeds using the crm criterion of choosing @xmath14 for each cohort from the set on @xmath118 to minimize @xmath120 starting at the lowest dose in the set , not skipping untried doses when escalating , and adding additional doses to the set once the first toxicity is observed .",
    "that is , restricting @xmath14 to @xmath118 in stage 1 reduces dose selection to a one - dimensional problem , and a conventional crm algorithm may be applied .",
    "geometrically , one may think of stage 1 as walking up and down the toxicity surface , along @xmath118 , looking for dose pairs with toxicity probability close to  @xmath119 .    in stage 2",
    ", @xmath14 is chosen for successive cohorts from the random isocontour @xmath121 since @xmath122 contains infinitely many @xmath14 , an additional criterion is needed to choose one @xmath14 for each cohort in stage 2 .",
    "tmml suggest two criteria , one based on the clinical criterion of `` cancer killing potential '' and the other the more usual statistical goal of maximizing fisher information . denoting the elements of @xmath8 by @xmath123 for convenience , the fisher information matrix @xmath124 for dose @xmath14 has @xmath125 entry @xmath126 $ ] . under the bayesian model , @xmath14",

    "any @xmath128 is a solution .",
    "thus , for example , one may choose three final dose pairs on @xmath129 , one on @xmath118 , one to the left of @xmath118 and one to the right of @xmath116 and randomize patients among these three @xmath14 pairs in a subsequent phase ii trial .    in their illustrative application , tmml use a cohort size of 2 with 60 patients divided into @xmath130 ( 10 cohorts ) in stage 1 and @xmath131 ( 20 cohorts ) in stage 2 .",
    "simulations show that using @xmath132 either ( 30 , 30 ) or ( 40 , 20 ) gives a design with inferior properties compared to ( 20 , 40 ) .",

    "however , the method is quite reliable in terms of choosing dose pairs that have true toxicity probability close to @xmath119 .",
    "from a clinical perspective , the primary purpose of treatment is to fight disease , and safety is never a secondary concern in any medical setting .",
    "thus , both scientifically and medically , both efficacy and toxicity matter at all stages of clinical investigation . in many dose - finding trials ,",
    "the entry criteria specify patients with such poor prognosis that response is very unlikely , between 4% and 10% . in such settings , targeting even a low response rate @xmath136 or 0.20 and",
    "using a phase ii type rule to stop accrual if the observed response rate is likely to be below @xmath137 at any acceptable dose may be impractical , since few or no responses are expected .",
    "this is the most common rationale for conducting phase i based on toxicity alone , while recording data on biological effects and possible clinical anti - disease effects .",
    "however , actual response rates vary widely between phase i trials , and many have complete or partial response rates well over 20% ( cf . horstmann et al . , @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , patients enroll in a phase i trial motivated by the hope that the new treatment will achieve an anti - disease effect , not simply the desire that no toxicity will occur .",
    "these considerations lead to the idea that , when it is realistic to target a response rate of 10% or larger , dose - finding should be done using a phase i / ii design based on both @xmath138 = efficacy and @xmath139 = toxicity .",

    "this was borne out by the extensive simulation studies reported by btnd . in the setting where only schedule is varied with pad fixed ,",
    "liu and braun ( @xcite ) have studied the use of a smooth component hazard function , a 2-parameter weibull , @xmath507 for @xmath508 where @xmath509 and @xmath402 is real - valued .",

    "is assigned the pair @xmath520 minimizing the objective function @xmath521 , similar to the crm .",
    "assignment of @xmath14 using this criterion is subject to the following two safety rules . given a maximum toxicity probability , @xmath522 specified by the physician , the schedule - dose pair @xmath515 is _ acceptable _ if @xmath523 where @xmath524 is a fixed upper cut - off such as 0.80 or 0.90 . if no pair in @xmath23 is acceptable , the trial is stopped",
    "this is similar to the toxicity portion of the acceptability criteria @xmath525 of the efftox methodology .",
    "the second safety rule is that escalation from @xmath515 is restricted in that no untried dose - schedule combination may be skipped , specifically the next patient may be treated at @xmath526 , @xmath527 or @xmath528 , but at no higher pair .",
    "there is no such constraint on de - escalation . while developing this methodology , we initially tried using the more restrictive constraint that does not allow diagonal escalation , from @xmath515 to untried @xmath528 , but this yielded a design with very poor properties .",
    "this is the case essentially because this constraint makes exploration of the 2-dimensional set of @xmath478 schedule - pad pairs unfeasible , and , in fact , it provides no additional measure of safety . while btnd recommended that the first patient be treated at the safest pair @xmath529 , in practice ,",
    "the physician might wish to start at @xmath530 , @xmath531 or @xmath532 .",
    "it may seem self - evident that this method is greatly superior to any comparable method that fixes schedule and only varies dose , since an optimal combination @xmath514 is simply ignored if the fixed schedule is not  @xmath533 .",
    "the simulations reported by btnd clearly illustrate this point .",
    "currently , however , it still is standard practice in phase i trials to guess what schedule might be best , possibly based on animal data , and proceed in humans by varying only dose .",
    "as described by btnd , this new methodology has been used to conduct an allotx trial of the post - transplant agent 5-azacitidine , which is thought to kill leukemia cells by reactivating tumor suppressor genes while also enhancing graft - versus - leukemia effect .",
    "each of the designs reviewed here includes one or more more aspects of treatment or outcome in an early phase trial that are ignored by standard designs .",
    "the price of accommodating such additional complexity is a much more structured model and method .",
    "this often requires substantially more work for trial design and conduct , including analysis of historical data , elicitation of priors and design parameters , development of computer software , carrying out simulations to calibrate design parameters and establish operating characteristics , and the difficult process of real time data monitoring during trial conduct . in each case",
    ", however , the design provides advantages over standard methods so large that the comparisons may seem unfair .",
    "evidently , accounting for both anti - disease effect and toxicity is a good idea , ignoring covariates is a bad idea , quantifying the clinical importance of different types and grades of toxicities is a good idea , and ignoring schedule effects is a bad idea .",
    "for example , the optimal treatment pair determined by the design in the 5-azacitidine trial was ( 40 mg@xmath4m@xmath5 per administration , 3  cycles ) , which simply could not have been found using a conventional dose - finding method that fixes schedule at 1 cycle .",
    "while each of the designs relies on a model with a nontrivial number of parameters , which in turn often requires elaborate prior specification and sophisticated numerical methods , the amount of information per patient also is much greater .",
    "the final questions are whether such designs have good properties , which the computer simulations show they do , and whether they can be implemented in practice , which has been the case for all of the designs discussed here .    for most early phase trials , conventional methods for determining sample size based on hypothesis testing or estimation may be of little use . to determine a planned maximum sample size for a phase i or i / ii trial , i ask the physicians the anticipated accrual rate , which often is a range of values , the desired maximum trial duration , and cost or other resource limitations , such as the amount of a specialized agent that feasibly can be produced in the laboratory .",
    "for each of several feasible maximum sample sizes , i simulate the trial and also compute posterior estimates of important parameters based on illustrative data sets .",
    "i then show these results to the physician and ask him / her to choose a maximum sample size on that basis .",
    "if the largest feasible sample size does not yield a reasonably reliable design , i  recommend that the trial not be conducted .",
    "using this practical approach , in my experience planned phase  i or i / ii sample sizes usually range from 24 to  60 .    the most severe difficulties in achieving widespread implementation of outcome - adaptive methods in early phase clinical trials are computational and sociological .",
    "the first practical requirement is portable , high quality computer software for implementation , including statistical programs that perform the necessary computations for specific methods and , ideally , graphical user interfaces that communicate with established databases and statistical programs to facilitate real - time data entry and computation of adaptive decision criteria during the trial .",
    "an `` elephant in the living room '' of outcome - adaptive methods for clinical trials is that constructing and implementing such information systems in medical environments is often much more difficult , expensive and time - consuming than developing a particular statistical method .",
    "moreover , once such a system is in place , the process of entering the patient data required by an outcome - adaptive method is time - consuming and potentially error prone .",
    "a natural question is whether one can construct practical designs that address the problems that arose in the sct trial described in the .",
    "such designs would optimize multiple schedule - dose combinations of several agents used in combination based on a vector of appropriately chosen efficacy and toxicity outcomes , possibly accounting for patient covariates and schedule - dose - covariate interactive effects on the outcomes , while adaptively choosing patient - specific schedule - dose combinations in real time .",
    "this also would require a decision criterion based on multiple outcomes , possibly using either efficacy - toxicity trade - offs or numerical utilities(houede et al . , @xcite ) .",
    "currently , we are working to develop new designs that include various combinations of these extensions . in my experience , however , early phase trials are so complex that most trials can not be optimally designed until after they already have been carried out , and a `` one size fits all '' design simply does not exist .",
    "clinical trials are viewed very differently by the pharmaceutical companies who produce and supply new agents , by regulatory agencies , by institutional review boards , by administrators who provide infrastructure and resources for trial conduct , by the physicians and nurses who actually treat the patients in a trial , and by the patients themselves .",
    "individuals with decision - making authority in all of these different groups must agree on a trial design before a trial may be conducted .",
    "many of these people regard the structure and properties of a particular statistical design as technicalities too complicated to understand and at most marginally relevant .",
    "most early phase trials are conducted using very simple conventional methods that do not require computers and are easy to implement .",
    "accounting more fully for the complexities of both the treatment regimes and the patients clinical outcomes is a double edged sword , since the greater safety and reliability that such methods provide is obtained only by working much harder in both design formulation and trial conduct .",
    "physicians who understand the advantages of properly constructed outcome - adaptive designs and want to use such methods are a minority , although they often provide the initial motivation for developing new statistical designs .",
    "their desire to use outcome - adaptive methods , and the recent shift in the pharmaceutical community , at least among statisticians , to embrace all things `` adaptive '' in clinical trials seem to beharbingers of a different future .",
    "how this may actually translate into practical reality in the coming years remains to be seen .",
