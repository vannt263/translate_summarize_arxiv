    "therefore a precise ephemeris , valid for the day of observation , had to be obtained in order to measure the rotation rate of the pulsar . in this case",
    "we used the time of arrival of the giant pulses at parkes , all of which are unresolved , as markers of the pulsar rotation rate .",
    "the pulsar timing package tempo2 @xcite was used to obtain a pulsar folding ephemeris for the observations .",

    "the phase of each giant pulse was determined from the arrival times of the giant pulses and the pulsar ephemeris derived from the parkes data ( see   [ pda ] ) .",
    "we find giant pulses only at the mp and ip phases of the pulsar rotation , consistent with earlier results @xcite .",
    "the total flux density was measured by integrating over a 40 ms window for every pulse period , beginning from the pulse arrival time .",
    "the integration window was determined by estimating the timescale over which the amplitude of the brightest pulse fell below the 1 @xmath0 noise level of the baseline .",
    "this corresponded to 40 ms , approximately 6 e - folds of the estimated scattering timescale ( see   [ scatt ] ) .",
    "the baseline was determined by a linear least square fit to the off - pulse power across a series of five windows , each 12ms wide , distributed before and after every pulse period in the timeseries ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "the resulting distribution of integrated flux density is consistent with the noise distribution of the integrated timeseries , because the number of giant pulses are few compared to the number of the observed periods ( @xmath780,000 periods ) .",
    "the root - mean - square noise variation ( rms ) was determined by estimating the standard deviation of the distribution , and the _ s / n _ was subsequently determined .",

    "we then subjected the simulated timeseries to the same analysis described .",
    "the number of false positives generated by this experiment above 3.5@xmath0 was two , a false positive rate we deemed acceptable where @xmath0 is the rms of the distribution .",
    "at this threshold , our minimum detectable flux density is @xmath770 jy .    in the actual analysis of the observed data - set , above a threshold of 3.5@xmath0 ,",
    "45 giant pulses were recovered from the mp phases and 10 giant pulses were recovered from the ip phase .",
    "the majority of giant pulses , 84@xmath1 , occur at the phase of the mp and the remaining 16@xmath1 occur at the ip phase .",
    "this is in agreement with previous results published in the literature @xcite .",
    "we now make the assumption , common in the literature , that the measured giant pulse energy is drawn from a power - law distribution , and attempt to determine the power - law index .",
    "we are in fact measuring the time integrated flux density , or _ fluence _ , which is a quantity directly proportional to pulse energy received by a given collecting area and will use this quantity in our analysis .",
    "a power - law index is often determined geometrically by a least squares fit of a straight line to logarithmically binned data @xcite .",
    "this is not the most reliable method of estimating this parameter and is generally considered to generate biased values of the power - law index @xcite . in order to remove subjectivity and to limit bias we have chosen to use hill s estimator as a maximum likelihood estimator ( mle ) of the index of the underlying fluence distribution . with @xmath48 measurements of fluence , @xmath49 , we determine the index , @xmath50 , of the underlying power - law distribution via : @xmath51    hill s estimator is sensitive to the determination of the power - law cut - off ( @xmath52 ) , but geometric methods are also very sensitive to this and often the power - law cut - off is chosen somewhat subjectively . to limit this subjectivity we have chosen to follow a method of minimising the kolmogorov - smirnov distance between the fitted distribution and the measured distribution , as a function of the power - law cut - off , in order to determine the optimum value of @xmath53 .",
    "the standard error in the power - law index estimate , @xmath54 , was also determined analytically . using this method we determined the power - law index of fluence distribution detected at the mwa to be @xmath553.35 @xmath56 0.35 .",
    "the cumulative distribution ( cdf ) of the main - pulse phase giant pulses detected with the mwa is shown in figure [ cdf ] .",
    "the slope of the cdf of giant pulse fluences can also be used to determine the index of the underlying power - law distribution , although error prone , this method is often used in the pulsar literature @xcite .",
    "the gradient is equal to @xmath57 , but as the index is formed from a least squares fit of a straight line to logarithmic bins that are not independent , the error in the index is difficult to determine . in this case",
    "we find a gradient of @xmath58 which would predict a @xmath50 of @xmath59 , consistent with our mle analysis .",
    "we applied the mle method to our observations of the parkes pulses ( at 1382mhz ) and obtained an index of @xmath552.85 @xmath56 0.05 , which is consistent with that obtained by @xcite ; it is slightly steeper than the @xmath60 and @xmath61 at 1300 and 1470 mhz reported by @xcite , but is within the range of @xmath62 to @xmath63 as given by @xcite .",
    "scattered pulse shapes are typically modelled as convolutions of intrinsic pulse shapes with the broadening functions characterising multi - path scattering through the ism and the instrumental response . by applying a deconvolution method as described in @xcite to the pulse shown in figure [ pulse ] , we estimate a pulse broadening time , @xmath64 ms , which can be compared to @xmath65 ms reported previously by @xcite from observations made with an early prototype built for the mwa .",
    "our estimated @xmath66 is thus nearly 10 @xmath67 larger than that measured earlier with the 3-tile prototype mwa and 5 @xmath67 larger than the extrapolated value from the observations of @xcite at a nearby frequency of 174 mhz .",
    "however , it is a factor of two less than that expected based on recent observations by @xcite with the lwa and their re - derived frequency scaling index , @xmath68 . as highlighted by @xcite and @xcite , the crab pulsar is well known for highly variable scattering , on timescales of the order of months to years , which can be attributed to ionised clouds or filaments within the nebula crossing the line of sight .      a search for coincident giant pulse arrival times was performed .",
    "of the 55 giant pulses that were detected with the mwa , 45 were detected during the period of simultaneous observations with the parkes radio telescope , and 1681 giant pulses were detected at parkes .",
    "due to the dispersive nature of the interstellar medium , the high frequency component of broadband giant pulses will arrive at the parkes observing frequency earlier than at the mwa frequency .",
    "the jodrell bank monthly ephemeris @xcite provides a dm for the crab pulsar of 56.774@xmath560.005 pc @xmath41 .",
    "the relative delay in pulse arrival time for this dm is therefore 5.746@xmath560.008 s between 1382.00 and 200.32 mhz ( upper band edge for the mwa ) .    in order to search for coincident giant pulses observed at the mwa and the parkes radio telescope",
    ", we performed a correlation analysis between the arrival times of the mwa and the parkes giant pulses .",
    "this analysis revealed that the backend used for data recording at parkes had a clock error of 36.000 s in the timestamps at the time of this observation .",
    "as a result , the timestamps for the parkes pulses are ahead of utc by 36.000 s. we found 23 coincident giant pulses at @xmath69 s ( see figure [ coincidence_pulses ] ) . correcting for the 36.000 s error yields 5.752 s delay ( mwa trailing parkes ) , consistent with the dispersive time delay between the arrival times of the mwa and the parkes giant pulses .",
    "the 23 coincident giant pulses detected at the mwa and parkes implies 51@xmath1 correlation , since 45 giant pulses were detected with the mwa during the common observing period",
    ". our observations are therefore consistent with previous observations ( e. g. @xcite ) , see   [ comparison ] for comparison .",
    "the spectral indices of the giant pulses detected simultaneously at the mwa and the parkes radio telescope were estimated using s@xmath70 , where s@xmath71 is the fluence of the giant pulse at frequency @xmath43 and @xmath72 is the spectral index .",
    "the values derived here are presented in figure [ spec_index ] , and display a range between @xmath73 and @xmath74 , which are steeper than the limits obtained by @xcite , @xmath551.44 @xmath56 3.3 and @xmath550.6 @xmath56 3.5 for the mp and ip , respectively .",
    "our limits are consistent with @xcite , based on their simultaneous detections of 29 giant pulses at 610 and 1400 mhz .",
    "@xcite constrain the spectral index spread to be within the range @xmath75 . the difference in the lower limit",
    "is discussed in  [ comparison ] .",
    "we detected a total of 55 giant pulses at the mwa , and estimate a power - law index of @xmath76 for their pulse fluence distribution , using the maximum likelihood estimator method .",
    "for the parkes data , in which we detected a total of 2075 pulses , application of this method yields @xmath77 . in the published literature , however , the reported power - law index for the giant pulse fluence distribution covers a wide range .",
    "different distributions have been considered , including pulse peak amplitude , average flux density , and pulse fluence , although a degree of proportionality exists between these different measures direct comparison is difficult .",
    "our power - law index of @xmath78 for the pulse fluence distribution at 193mhz is steeper than the range from @xmath79 to @xmath80 that was reported by @xcite at 110 - 180 mhz .",
    "@xcite estimate @xmath81 for the index of giant pulse peak amplitude distribution at the main - pulse phase ; their observation was made at 430mhz and they note that the distribution only obeys a power - law for a limited range of pulse flux density .",
    "however our estimated @xmath82 is in good agreement with a value of @xmath83 determined by @xcite for the average flux density distribution from their extensive observations at 800mhz .",
    "we propose that the majority of the published variation in power - law indices arises from the underlying distribution not following a simple power law over a large range of fluences and also from inconsistencies in the subjective determination of the power - law cut - off .",
    "the mle based method that we used here has the virtue of removing some subjectivity from this analysis",
    ".      observed radio pulses are often influenced by interstellar scintillation @xcite . under unfavorable conditions",
    ", this effect can strongly modulate the observed fluence of giant pulses . in our case , this effect may arise from refractive modulation since short - term diffractive modulations will be highly quenched over our observing duration and bandwidth , at both mwa and parkes frequencies .",

    "it is likely that the paucity of pulses with spectral indices shallower than @xmath73 is due to the sensitivity limit of the mwa telescope and consequently that the intrinsic degree of correlation is likely to be much higher than 50% .",
    "we hypothesise that the apparent reduction of correlation is due to the wide range of spectral index displayed by the giant pulses , coupled with the sensitivity limits of the two telescopes .    in order to investigate this further",
    ", a monte carlo simulation was conducted using the parkes data as the known distribution of giant pulse fluence .",
    "attempts were made to predict the number of pulses detected coincidentally at the mwa and their spectral index distribution using a two sample komolgorov - smirnov ( ks ) test .",

    "we chose to investigate this further and determine the parameters of such a distribution that would best fit our data .",
    "we allowed the mean of the distribution to vary between @xmath91 and @xmath73 , but held the standard deviation to 0.6 , consistent with the observations of @xcite , and investigated the predicted number of coincident detections and their spectral indices .    for each of the parkes giant - pulse detections we randomly drew a spectral index from the distribution under test and predicted the fluence of the pulse at the mwa . if the predicted fluence was above the mwa detection threshold we registered a detection and the spectral index that was associated with it .",
    "this was repeated for every pulse .",
    "each trial distribution was tested 1000 times and the results combined .",
    "as we have recorded observations at both telescopes we can reverse this analysis and use the mwa detected pulse and spectral index distribution to predict the coincident pulses at parkes , and thereby determine the percentage of correlated pulses .",
    "we are only observing the steep spectrum end of the giant pulse distribution at the mwa , as evidenced by inspecting the measured spectral index distribution .",
    "we can infer that some pulses detected at the mwa will have a combination of fluence and steep spectral index that would bring them below the detection threshold at parkes .",

    "should simultaneously satisfy both these constraints .",
    "the error bar is the standard deviation about this average prediction .",
    "the upper panel shows the results , both distance and p - value , for the two - sample ks test between the predicted spectral index distribution of the coincident pulses and the measured distribution ; the error bar is the standard error .",
    "the p - value can be interpreted as the probability that the distance is as large as observed , if the null hypothesis is true ( being that both populations are drawn from the same distribution ) .",
    "the null hypothesis is typically not rejected if the distance is below a critical value for the two distributions under test .",
    "these results show that , for those distributions with a significant p - value , we can not reject the null hypothesis and that the observed and simulated spectral index distributions are consistent with same parent distribution .    without any fine tuning , the simulations predict the following :    * the detected spectral index distribution at the mwa is best replicated by an input spectral index distribution of -2.85 with a standard deviation of 0.6 * the observed 50% correlation is best replicated by a spectral index distribution closer to -3.15 * both these input distributions over - estimate the number of coincident pulses by a factor of 2 to 3      the simplest , and most reasonable fine tuning is to reflect the lack of flux density calibration and assume some less - than - theoretical detection sensitivity . we can align the number of mwa detections with the best fit spectral index distribution , using the mwa detection threshold as a fit parameter . raising",
    "the mwa detection threshold by 10% generates a best fit mean spectral index distribution of -2.8 , and correctly predicts the number of mwa detections .",
    "however it can not simultaneously replicate the correlation percentage , which is now reproduced by invoking a source spectral index distribution with a mean of -3.2 .    altering the width of the model spectral index distribution",
    "does not provide the required fine tuning .",
    "the width of 1.2 is wide enough that it produces features similar to that generated by a uniform distribution of spectral indices . in",
    "that we can reproduce the number of detections at the mwa but the distribution of `` observed ''",
    "spectral indices differs too greatly . in the case of the narrow distribution ,",
    "it is difficult to reproduce the number of detections unless we adjust the relative sensitivity of the telescopes beyond what would be considered reasonable .",
    "a distribution that satisfies the constraints in predicting the parkes pulse survival to the mwa observing frequency is therefore still inconsistent with the distribution that satisfies the degree of correlation .",
    "a more sophisticated fine - tuning would be to invoke some evolution in the distribution as a function of frequency .",
    "we have found that this evolution does not have to be extreme in order to remove the inconsistency .",
    "a 5% flattening in the spectral index , on average , between the two frequencies is all that is required to match the observed pulse coincidence rate , while maintaining a spectral index distribution consistent with that observed .",
    "we obtained this estimate using the previous monte carlo analysis , but including an average reduction factor in the randomly drawn individual pulse spectral index when predicting the observed fluence at the mwa .",
    "we incorporated the same factor in the inverse experiment .    incorporating this fine tuning ,",
    "our observations are consistent with the hypothesis that the spectral index of giant pulses is drawn from normal distribution of standard deviation 0.6 , but with a mean that displays an evolution with frequency from -3.00 at 1382 mhz , to -2.85 at 192 mhz .",
    "note this estimation only includes the integrated effect of the evolution in spectral index , and therefore does not incorporate curvature .",
    "it would be consistent with these results if the low frequency spectral index were considerably flatter , or the high frequency steeper , than that estimated here , but that would require a rapid evolution , such as a turn - over , to be present .",
    "figure [ fine - tuning ] shows the results of the analysis including the fine tuning and we summarise the results here :    * the mwa detection threshold is 10% less sensitive than our theoretical prediction * there is a 5% flattening in the mean of the spectral index distribution from -3.00 to -2.85 between 1382 mhz and 192 mhz , the spectral index distribution in this analysis has width of 0.6 , but this has not been constrained by the fits * this distribution correctly predicts the number of coincident detections and the 50% correlation between the two observations    the _ normal _ emission from pulsars typically obeys a simple power law of index @xmath92 @xcite .",
    "however , the mp and ip components of the crab pulsar have much steeper spectral indices of -2.8 and -3.7 when measured between 410 and 1660 mhz @xcite .",
    "a flattening in the spectra of normal pulsar emission is commonly observed and many young pulsars have been found to display complex spectra and low frequency ( @xmath7100mhz ) spectral turn - overs @xcite .",
    "the phase averaged emission from the crab pulsar is complicated due to the multi - component structure .",
    "we are unaware of any observed flattening of mp component at lower frequencies but suspect that this is confused by the rapid evolution of precursor .",
    "the cause of the spectral turnover in these objects is not known and experiments are complicated by the difficulty of observing complex pulse profiles at low frequencies .      our measurements of the scattering timescale (  [ scatt ] ) indicate that the environment of the nebula continues to affect the observations of the pulsar , as already observed by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . free - free absorption within the filamentary structures , evident in observations of the crab nebula , has already been reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we now investigate whether this effect could be responsible for the modest flattening in spectral index that has been indicated by our analysis .",
    "the free - free absorption coefficient ( @xmath93 ) in the rayleigh - jeans regime can be numerically approximated ( in cgs units ) to be : @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the atomic number of the absorber , @xmath96 and @xmath97 , are the number density per @xmath98 of the electrons and ions respectively , and",
    "t is the temperature in k @xcite .",
    "@xmath99 is the gaunt factor , which in this regime ( the high temperature or",
    "_ quantum limit _ ) is approximated by @xcite : @xmath100 where _ k _ is boltzmann s constant , _",
    "h _ is planck s constant , and @xmath101 is euler s constant . at these temperatures and frequencies",
    "the gaunt factor is approximately 10 .",
    "the optical depth @xmath102 is given by : @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the path length , and the absorption factor is subsequently calculated as @xmath105 .",
    "the nebula has an approximate radius of 1.7 pc and if all the observed dm ( 56.70 @xmath41pc ) were due to the nebula , then @xmath96 would be 56.7/1.7 or 33.4 @xmath41 . assuming the nebula is predominantly hydrogen , @xmath106 , @xmath107 @xmath41 at a temperature 10@xmath108k , then at our observing frequency ( @xmath109 hz ) the free - free absorption coefficient is @xmath110 cm@xmath13 .",
    "this is insufficient to account for any absorption even at these very high gaunt factors .",
    "the ionised material is not evenly distributed , and this inhomogeneity will strongly influence the level of free - free absorption .",
    "the filamentary structures of the nebula that have been observed to display free - free absorption in spectral index maps by @xcite , have been estimated to have an electron density in excess of 200 @xmath41 .",
    "these are arcsecond size structures , implying a size scale of 0.02 pc .",
    "each of these filaments would contribute @xmath112 to the optical depth and attenuate the intensity by a factor of 0.9998 , which also can not supply the necessary absorption even if several hundred filaments intercept the line of sight .",
    "@xcite use line intensities to estimate the filamentary @xmath96 to be @xmath113 @xmath41 , however each filament now contributes @xmath7 10 @xmath41pc to the dispersion measure so only a small number of crossings are permitted , therefore these structures can not provide the level of absorption required .    there is also evidence of very small ( au ) scale filamentary structures with electron densities in excess of 10@xmath108 @xmath41 @xcite . if many tens of these small filaments are intercepted , they are capable of generating the few percent level absorption required ( few % )",
    ". they would also not contribute more than 10 @xmath41pc to the pulsar dispersion measure .",
    "however it is unlikely that these structures exist in sufficient numbers to contribute at this level @xcite .    in summary",
    "it is unlikely that free - free absorption within the filamentary nebula is capable of attenuating the pulse intensity sufficiently to explain our predictions , and therefore any variation in the spectra of the giant pulses is unlikely to be propagative in nature .",
    "in this article , we report observations performed simultaneously with the mwa , at a frequency of 193 mhz ( 15 mhz bandwidth ) and the parkes radio telescope , at a frequency of 1382 mhz ( 340 mhz bandwidth ) . we detected a total of 55 giant pulses at the mwa , and estimate a power - law index of @xmath76 for their pulse fluence distribution .",
    "23 of the pulses were detected at both the mwa and at parkes radio telescope .",
    "these results are consistent with the spectral index of the giant pulses being drawn from normal distribution , the parameters of which are frequency dependent .",
    "the mean of the spectral index distribution varies from @xmath114 to @xmath115 between 1382 mhz and 192 mhz .",
    "it is unlikely that this flattening can be caused by any propagative effects within the nebula .    in this work",
    "we have proposed that the less than total correlation observed is simply a function of the spread in giant pulse spectral indices and the relative sensitivities of the two instruments , but have not proposed a mechanism by which this large range of spectral indices may be generated .",
    "giant pulses are thought to comprise complex temporal substructures on nano - second to micro - second timescales @xcite . @xcite",
    "have noted that these substructures are strongly correlated at two observing frequencies with a small fractional bandwidth , and less correlated as the fractional bandwidth increases , suggesting a complex behaviour as a function of frequency , can not be ruled out by the behaviour we see in this experiment .",
    "the mwa s large frequency coverage and flexible system design offer unique opportunities to further investigate the wide - band properties of giant pulses . with the full - bandwidth vcs recording now feasible @xcite , it is possible to perform sensitive observations simultaneously at multiple frequencies within the 80 - 300 mhz range , by suitably spreading out the 30.72 mhz observing band across a large range in frequency",
    ". this will allow us to conduct observations that span large fractional bandwidths , with the prospects of determining the emission bandwidth and spectral nature of giant pulses at low frequencies .",
    "combining all the mwa tiles coherently , we will realise a factor of @xmath711 improvement in sensitivity over this experiment . with an increase in gain by this factor , as well as increase in bandwidth by a factor of 2 ,",
    "the instrument is expected to detect about 10,000 pulses in a one hour observation .",
    "this also implies that about 600 pulses are expected to be detectable in a 1.28 mhz subband of the mwa .",
    "this increase in sensitivity means that a higher percentage of coincident pulses will be detectable when observing in the coherent mode with the mwa full bandwidth .    _",
