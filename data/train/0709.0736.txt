    "there has been a considerable recent interest in the study of pattern formation in expanding domains , and pattern formation supported by them , in the context of reaction - diffusion equations ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein for a substantial body of earlier work ) .",
    "such mechanisms are viewed in mathematical biology as a possibly important element in the formation of skin patterns on species of animals or fishes @xcite .",
    "one of the key ideas in that regard is that in the case of finite - size domains , turing - type mechanisms @xcite are only activated for appropriate wavenumbers , which , in turn , signify appropriate sizes of the domain . in particular , as is pointed out in @xcite , the domain size should be such so as to admit at least a half - cycle of the intrinsic pattern ( to be formed by the instability ) wavelength .",
    "once activated , these mechanisms typically lead to the destabilization of a uniform concentration profile , due to the presence of diffusion , and the formation of localized waveforms through frequency - doubling and related mechanisms  @xcite .",
    "our aim in the present work is to illustrate that such mechanisms are not only relevant in reaction - diffusion equations and pattern - forming dissipative systems , but also to hamiltonian nonlinear dispersive wave equations , such as the prototypical model of the nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation @xcite .",
    "the latter class of models also features instabilities which emerge only for appropriate bands of wavenumbers ; a prominent example of such instabilities is the modulational instability ( mi ) of the plane wave solutions of the focusing nls equation ( see e.g. @xcite for a recent review and @xcite for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "this instability only emerges ( for a fixed amplitude of the plane wave ) for sufficiently _ small _ wavenumbers , i.e. , for sufficiently large perturbation wavelengths , or ( for a fixed wavenumber ) for sufficiently large amplitudes of the plane wave .",
    "hence , one can envision a setting where the initial domain is small enough that the smallest wavenumber permissible by the domain ( say , @xmath0 for periodic boundary conditions and domain size @xmath1 ) is larger than the critical wavenumber for the onset of the instability .",
    "equivalently , the domain size may be smaller , at time @xmath2 , than the minimum wavelength necessary for the instability . then , with an appropriate temporal dependence , the domain size may increase and cross the relevant instability threshold ; this , in turn , leads to the emergence of patterns in a way reminiscent of that occuring in their turing analogs in dissipative systems .",
    "in fact , these patterns in the hamiltonian case will consist of robust solitary waves , as we will illustrate below , since mi is one of the key mechanisms leading to the formation of such structures @xcite .",
    "this mechanism could be of relevance to a wide array of hamiltonian systems , since the nls model is relevant to a diverse set of applications including the propagation of light in optical fibers @xcite , the dynamics of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) at extremely low temperatures @xcite , plasma physics and fluid dynamics @xcite , and so on .",
    "in fact , mi in itself is still one of the most active topics of investigation in some of these contexts .",
    "in particular , a variant of mi was used in the first experiment that demonstrated the generation of matter - wave soliton trains in becs @xcite .",
    "furthermore , mi is recently becoming increasingly accessible in a variety of settings experimentally ( and theoretically ) ; these include spatially periodic ones such as becs confined in optical lattices ( where mi introduces a classical form of a superfluid - insulator transition @xcite ) and optical waveguide arrays @xcite , as well as ones that are periodic in the evolution variable , such as the nonlinear layered optical media recently studied in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the presentation of our results will be structured as follows .",
    "we will first give a brief theoretical background on the nature of the instability and explain how it is affected by the existence of a finite domain size .",
    "we will then proceed to examine four different numerical experiments , attempting to elucidate the emergence of the instability for time - dependent domain sizes .",
    "our first and most straightforward example will be the one discussed above : a stable uniform solution ( for sufficiently small domain size ) will be subjected to a time - dependent domain expansion , resulting in what we will call a `` soliton sprinkler '' through the emergence of mi .",
    "our second experiment will be somewhat counter - intuitive in that the instability will emerge even though the domain size is _",
    "decreasing_. this will be achieved by preserving the @xmath3 norm of the solution ( its power in optics or its number of atoms in bec ) , and taking advantage of the instability dependence on the beam intensity .",
    "the last two examples will introduce an expanding or contracting domain situation in a somewhat modified but also directly relevant and more straightforwardly realizable experimental setting , inspired by the physics of becs .",
    "in particular , we will use a parabolic potential ( routinely employed to trap the bec ) with a time - dependent frequency , which , in turn , may weaken or strengthen the confinement of the atoms , introducing a corresponding _ effective _ expansion or contraction of the domain .",
    "we will seek signatures of mi in this more complex , yet more realistic setting .",
    "finally , we will summarize our findings and present our conclusions .",
    "we consider the following dimensionless nls equation for the field @xmath4 , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the nonlinearity coefficient and @xmath7 is an external potential .",
    "note that in the context of becs this equation is usually referred to as the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation @xcite ) ; in that case , @xmath4 is the bec wavefunction , @xmath6 is proportional to the s - wave scattering length , and @xmath7 is a trapping potential where the bec is confined . for simplicity , the nonlinearity coefficient is scaled so that @xmath8 , corresponding , respectively , to repulsive or attractive interatomic interactions ( or , generally , to defocusing or focusing nonlinearity ) . equation ( [ gp ] ) conserves the energy , as well as the squared @xmath3 norm , @xmath9 ( in the context of becs , @xmath10 represents the normalized number of atoms of the condensate ) .    for our theoretical analysis",
    ", we first consider the homogeneous ( untrapped ) case , i.e. , eq .",
    "( [ gp ] ) with @xmath11 , which admits plane - wave solutions of the form @xmath12 $ ] , where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 are , respectively , the amplitude , wavenumber and frequency of the plane wave solution .",
    "these parameters are connected through the dispersion relation : @xmath16 .",
    "the stability of the aforementioned solution is analyzed by introducing the following linear stability ansatz into eq .",
    "( [ gp ] ) : @xmath17 , \\label{stab}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are perturbations of the amplitude and the phase respectively . by solving the resulting linear equations [",
    "to o@xmath20 through the fourier mode expansion @xmath21 $ ] and @xmath22 $ ] , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the wavenumber and frequency of the perturbations respectively ( @xmath25 const . ) , we finally obtain the dispersion relation @xmath26    noting that the plane wave solution is modullationally stable if and only if im@xmath27 , we will limit our considerations to the focusing case with @xmath28 , which may potentially lead to mi ( apparently , in that case @xmath24 becomes complex ) . in this case , eq .",
    "( [ stab ] ) shows that if @xmath29 the plane wave solution becomes modulationally unstable .",
    "so , we notice that there is an implicit dependence on the size of the domain , @xmath1 .",
    "this is , in particular , because the wavenumbers accessible in a domain of size @xmath1 are bounded from below by @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , we infer ( as was also explained in the introduction ) that there exists a minimum @xmath1 , which we denote @xmath31 such that @xmath32 , and therefore the uniform solution is _ not _ subject to mi and is thus guaranteed to be dynamically stable .",
    "it can be anticipated , based on the above discussion , that upon growing such a stable domain beyond the critical size @xmath33 , unstable wavenumbers may emerge .",
    "so , starting with @xmath34 , we perturb the plane wave solution of amplitude @xmath35 with a stable wavenumber ( @xmath36 ) and numerically implement the solution of eq .",
    "( [ gp ] ) in a growing domain @xmath37 , such that @xmath38 ( here @xmath39 ) . the resulting evolution is illustrated in fig . [ kfig1 ] .",
    "the top panel shows the space - time evolution of the intensity ( the solution s square modulus @xmath40 ) , illustrating the emergence of a `` soliton sprinkler '' , with an increasing number of solitary waves appearing , as the domain size increases .",
    "the bottom left four panels show snapshots of the time evolution of the intensity , clearly indicating the growth of the perturbation and the eventual formation of multiple solitary wave peaks .",
    "even more importantly , the bottom right set of panels elucidates the evolution in fourier space , with the principal ( nonzero ) wavenumber initially being _ above _ the critical wavenumber for the instability ( shown by the vertical line ) .",
    "as time evolves however , @xmath1 increases , hence @xmath41 decreases , and upon the crossing of the critical point we observe growth of the relevant perturbation wavenumbers and hence the concomitant generation of the localized peaks in real space .",
    "we note that in this numerical experiment , as well as in those that will be presented in the following subsections , we have used a uniform space mesh of size @xmath42 and a time step of @xmath43 .",
    "the methods employed are centered , second - order finite difference for spatial discretization and fourth - order runge - kutta for time integration .",
    "we use periodic boundary conditions in order to effectively capture the frequency decomposition .    in the present implementation , rather than rescaling space as was done in some of the earlier works in the dissipative context , we maintain the same mesh - size , while _ actually _ increasing the domain with extra nodes at the endpoints of the domain .",
    "notice that the above figure ( fig .",
    "[ kfig1 ] ) does nt depict the entire final domain , which is approximately @xmath44 , but merely the relevant activity in the center .     for an initial condition with @xmath35 and a perturbation of @xmath45 .",
    "bottom left panels : four spatial profiles at times @xmath46 ( stable ) , @xmath47 ( marginal ) , @xmath48 ( unstable ) and @xmath49 ( unstable ) .",
    "bottom right panels : four respective fourier profiles ; the smallest wavenumber present in the solution crosses the critical threshold exactly when the domain size equals the critical value , @xmath50 . with time , more subcritical wavenumbers appear and are accordingly amplified.,title=\"fig:\",width=302][full ]    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     finally , we consider the case where the strength of the harmonic trap is increased for the same type of solutions as in numerical experiment iii . here , the intensity of the solution is increased as the domain is contracting and , hence we can simply allow the dynamics to evolve for different values of @xmath51 .",
    "what we observe suggests a similar scenario of `` stability '' versus `` instability '' as in case iii . in particular , for small increase of @xmath52 ( left panels of fig .",
    "[ kfig4 ] ) , the dynamics of the spatial profile remains unimodal ( and its fourier transform near - gaussian ) and the beam width oscillates in a near - periodic fashion . on the other hand , for larger trapping strengths ( middle and right panels of fig .",
    "[ kfig4 ] ) , the intensity profile involves an increasing number of modes ( and its fourier transform accordingly has multiple nodes ) , and the oscillation of the beam width becomes increasingly irregular , involving a much wider band of frequencies . notice that in this case , similar to case ii , no injection of matter is necessary : the instability emerges due to the increase in the intensity , necessitated by the conservation of the @xmath3 norm .",
    "in this work , we have explored how the use of the domain size variations and their effects on instabilities can be introduced in a conservative wave setting , by examining the prototypical case of the one - dimensional nonlinear schrdinger equation .",
    "we illustrated that this generic model has a modulational instability that can play a role similar to the turing instability of reaction - diffusion systems .",
    "in particular , we demonstrated that one can take advantage of domain width variability to controllably `` excite '' the instability and lead to the formation of soliton train patterns in the dispersive system .",
    "we examined four different manifestations of this feature .",
    "two of them were relevant to the uniform , untrapped system and two were associated with the setting of an harmonic trap , relevant to bose - einstein condensates . in the arguably most standard illustration of the relevant phenomenology ( in comparison with its dissipative analog ) , expansion of a domain for a uniform ,",
    "untrapped solution led to the realization of a `` soliton sprinkler '' , emitting more solitons as the domain grew wider . on the other hand",
    ", somewhat counter - intuitively , we showed that the instability can even emerge for untrapped systems in contracting domains , provided that the `` mass '' ( @xmath3 norm ) of the profile is preserved .",
    "we also demonstrated how the relevant stability or instability notions can be re - interpreted in the more realistic , yet not spatially uniform , context of harmonically confined condensates .",
    "in particular , in the `` stable '' case , the distribution remained unimodal featuring near - periodic oscillations of its width , while in the `` unstable '' case , multiple humps emerged in the dynamics of the intensity and complex oscillations in its moments .",
    "this was illustrated both for the expanding domain case of decreasing the parabolic trap strength , as well as for the contracting domain case of increasing it .",
    "it would certainly be relevant to implement similar ideas in higher - dimensional settings , where there also exists the additional complication of focusing and wave collapse @xcite",
    ". it would be especially interesting to elucidate the interplay of the different mechanisms , with the modulational instability inducing the emergence of localized waveforms , which , in turn , may be subject to collapse .",
    "it may also be intriguing to implement such ideas in discrete systems , given their recent extensive experimental relevance @xcite and some of the unique features that they possess such as the instability being accessible even for defocusing nonlinearities .",
    "such studies are currently in progress and will be reported in future publications .",
