    "over the last nineteen years , observations of the statistical properties such as the initial mass function , velocity dispersion , multiplicity , accretion , jets ( see @xcite and references therein ) of brown dwarfs ( bd ) ( 1375  @xmath10 ) and very low - mass ( vlm ) stars ( 0.10.2 @xmath4 ) ( hereafter , vlm objects ) in nearby star - forming regions have shown that all these properties of vlm objects form a continuum with those of low - mass stars .",
    "these observations therefore strongly support the starlike models ( see @xcite and references therein ) that vlm objects form in the same manner as low - mass stars . while the starlike models predict that pre - bd cores , which are produced by turbulent fragmentation of molecular clouds @xcite or gravitational fragmentation @xcite , are dense enough to be gravitationally unstable , it is still unclear how the physical processes of bd formation occur at later stages , such as at class 0 , i and ii .",
    "since bipolar molecular outflows , which are ambient gas swept up by an underlying jet / wind ( see @xcite and references therein ) , are a basic component of the star formation process , studying the molecular outflow properties will therefore help us understand the bd formation mechanism . in the last few years",
    ", we have reported the first detections of bipolar molecular outflows from the class ii bd iso - oph  102 in @xmath9 ophiuchi @xcite , the class ii vlm star mho  5 in taurus @xcite .",
    "our estimated values of outflow mass and mass loss rate in these vlm objects are over an order of magnitude smaller than the typical values in low - mass stars .",
    "these results have implied that the outflow process in vlm objects is a scaled - down version of that in low - mass stars .",
    "our detections have also provided strong observational constraints such as velocity , size , mass and mass - loss rate of the outflow process for the simulation of bd formation ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "although the molecular outflow process holds important clues to bd formation , however , only four detections of molecular outflows in the substellar domain have been reported so far : two molecular outflows from class 0/i proto bd and vlm candidates ( l1014-irs : @xcite ; l1148-irs : @xcite ) , one from a class ii bd ( iso - oph 102 , @xmath1160  @xmath10 : @xcite ) and one from a class ii vlm star ( mho 5 , @xmath1190  @xmath10 : @xcite ) .    in this paper",

    "gm tau was identified as a pre - main - sequence star @xcite , in the dark cloud hcl  2 or tmc  1 ( e.g. , @xcite ) according to its position .",
    "the source was then spectroscopically classified as an m6.5 dwarf with an estimated mass of @xmath1173  m@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "gm tau shows an obvious p cygni profile ( see figure  4 in @xcite ) with blue - shifted absorption components superposed on the h@xmath13 accretion emission profile , which strongly indicates a mass - loss process as seen in higher mass t tauri stars .",
    "2 m  0414 is an m6.25 dwarf of 75  m@xmath12 @xcite , the source lies in the dark cloud ldn  1495 ( e.g. , @xcite ) according to its position .",
    "the h@xmath13 emission of 2 m  0414 also shows a clear p cygni profile ( see figure  4 in @xcite ) , implying a mass - loss process occurring in the source .",
    "2 m 0438 is an m7.25 dwarf of 70  m@xmath12 @xcite , which lies in the same dark cloud as gm  tau .",
    "this bd exhibits strong forbidden emission lines ( fels ) @xcite as seen in mho  5 that could be associated with outflow activities .",
    "they are therefore excellent targets for our search for molecular outflows in vlm objects .",
    "one should note that no detection of any cores associated with the three sources has been reported so far .",
    "we observed gm  tau with the submillimeter array ( sma ) , and 2 m  0414 and 2 m  0438 with combined array for research in millimeter - wave astronomy ( carma ) .",
    "the observing log of the three young bds is given in table  [ log ] .",
    "the sma receiver band at 230  ghz ( see @xcite ) was used for the observations of gm  tau on 2010 october 26 .",

    "the rms sensitivity was @xmath111  mjy for the continuum and @xmath110.15  jy  beam@xmath7 per channel for the line data ( table  [ log ] ) .",
    "we observed the two bds 2 m  0414 and 2 m  0438 with carma at 230 ghz in 2010 august .",
    "all six 10.4 m , and nine 6.1 m antennas were operated in the d configuration .",

    "all eight 500 mhz - wide bands ( a maximum bandwidth of 4 ghz per sideband ) , which may be positioned independently with the if bandwidth , were used with different spectral resolutions for @xmath14co  @xmath17 line .",

    "these modes give a wide range of spectral resolutions from 0.03 to 6.8 km  s@xmath7 at 230 ghz .",
    "we observed quasar 3c 111 for gain calibration , 3c 84 and 3c 454.3 for passband calibration , and uranus and 3c 84 for flux calibration .",
    "the uncertainty in the absolute flux calibration is @xmath1120% .",
    "we reduced the data with the miriad package adapted for the carma .",
    "the synthesized beam sizes are about 2@xmath18.09  @xmath19  1@xmath18.69 and 2@xmath18.19  @xmath19  1@xmath18.68 using natural weighting for 2 m  0414 and 2 m  0438 , respectively .",
    "the fwhm of the primary beam for the 10.4@xmath196.1 m antennas is about 36@xmath18 at 230 ghz .",
    "the rms sensitivities of the continuum and the line data are listed in table  [ log ] .",
    "2 m 0414 and 2 m 0438 are strong accretors ( see table  [ comp ] and references therein ) .",
    "while the h@xmath13 emission with an obvious p cygni profile observed in 2 m  0414 @xcite indicates an outflow process and the presence of fels in 2 m  0438 @xcite suggests outflow activities , our carbon monoxide ( co @xmath17 ) maps from carma data however do not reveal any outflows from 2 m  0414 and 2 m  0438 .",
    "the non - detection of molecular outflows in these two bds indicates three possible scenarios as discussed in @xcite : ( 1 ) the outflow process has already stopped ; ( 2 ) there is not much gas surrounding the sources ; ( 3 ) the outflow process in these bds is too weak to be detectable at the millimeter wavelengths .    for the case of 2 m  0414 ,",
    "the outflow process has clearly been indicated in its h@xmath13 emission , therefore , the first scenario should be ruled out . as the source",
    "is located in the dense region of @xmath14co and @xmath15co @xmath21 of ldn  1495 ( see figure  4 in @xcite ) , the second scenario is thus unlikely in this case .",
    "finally , the bolometric luminosity of 2 m  0414 is 0.015  @xmath22 @xcite , about 3 times less luminous than that of gm  tau ( 0.047  @xmath22 , @xcite ) . if we assume that the outflow force vs. bolometric luminosity correlation of proto stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) is applicable for young bds , this thus indicates that the outflow force of 2 m  0414 would be weaker ( i.e. , weaker molecular outflow emission ) than that of gm  tau . as a possible outflow from gm  tau",
    "is marginally detected ( see section  4.2 ) , therefore , the third scenario would be a reasonable explanation for the non - detection of outflows from 2 m  0414 .    for the case of 2 m  0438 ,",
    "the source is also located in the dense region ( see figure  4 in @xcite ) and it is close to gm  tau ( at a distance of only @xmath112.8@xmath23 ) , the second scenario is thus very unlikely .",
    "the fels may be associated with outflow or accretion activities , the first scenario is thus still possible .",
    "one should note that the bolometric luminosity of 2 m  0438 is very low ( 0.0018  @xmath22 , @xcite ) , therefore , the outflow force is expected to be much less powerful than that of any class ii bds with molecular outflows detected so far .",
    "so , the first and the third scenarios are both possible for 2 m  0438 .",
    "one should also note that we did not detect the dust continuum emission from 2 m  0414 and 2 m  0438 with an upper limit of about @xmath24 ( 1@xmath25 = 1.4 mjy for 2 m  0438 and 1.1  mjy for 2 m  0414 ) .",
    "our measurements are comparable within error bars to those reported in @xcite , 0.91@xmath260.65  mjy for 2 m  0414 and 2.29@xmath260.75  mjy for 2 m  0438 .",
    "gm tau is also a strong accretor with a mass accretion rate stronger than that of 2 m  0414 and 2 m  0438 ( table  [ comp ] ) .",
    "its obvious p cygni profile of h@xmath13 emission strongly indicates the outflow process occurring in the bd .",
    "the systemic velocity of gm tau has not been available in the literature so far . to measure the systemic velocity of the bd",
    ", we extract a @xmath15co @xmath21 spectrum toward gm  tau with the reprocessed fcrao taurus survey data from @xcite .",
    "the fwhm of the @xmath15co line is about 2.2  km  s@xmath7 ( fig .",
    "[ vsys ] ) , which is better described by two gaussian components with peak velocities of @xmath27  km  s@xmath7 and @xmath28  km  s@xmath7 , respectively .",
    "the large - scale velocity gradient of @xmath15co seems to roughly follow a larson s law - type power - law with respect to spatial scales ( see fig .",
    "18 in @xcite ) .",
    "the fwhm of the fcrao primary beam is about 50@xmath18 . within 50@xmath18",
    ", it is thus normal in taurus to have gas components moving at 0.5@xmath201  km  s@xmath7 with respect to each other .",
    "the fcrao data therefore suggests the systemic velocity of gm  tau to be in the range from 5.5 to 6.5  km  s@xmath7 .",
    "we thus take an average value of 6.0  km  s@xmath7 for the systemic velocity of the bd .",
    "figure  [ map ] presents the integrated intensity in the co  @xmath17 emission towards gm  tau .",
    "our map reveals only a redshifted ( @xmath116.6@xmath207.2  km  s@xmath7 ) co gas lobe around the bd position",
    ". no blueshifted emission is detected .",
    "it is therefore difficult to confirm that the redshifted lobe is outflow emission from gm tau .",
    "however , the gas lobe is elongated in the northeast direction of the bd position , with a position angle of about 36@xmath29 .",
    "this suggests that the redshifted emission is possibly outflow emission from gm  tau .",
    "one should note that the redshifted component is marginally detected at only @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , if it really comes from an outflow of the bd , the detection of the co outflow from gm  tau should be considered as a tentative detection .",
    "our previous detections @xcite have shown that the molecular outflow in vlm objects is bipolar as seen in low - mass stars and the intensity of the outflow emission differs significantly between the redshifted and blueshifted components .",
    "therefore , the non - detection of blueshifted outflow emission from gm  tau is probably due to that the emission is too weak to be detected with sma .",
    "the redshifted emission is brighter than the blueshifted emission implies that the redshifted jet propagates into denser gas than the blueshifted jet , leading to a larger swept up mass of co gas ( i.e. , stronger molecular outflow emission ) .",
    "deeper observations are needed to confirm this scenario .",
    "if the detected redshifted gas lobe is a component of outflows from gm  tau , we then follow the standard manner @xcite as used in the previous papers @xcite to calculate the outflow properties .",
    "the size of the redshifted co gas lobe is about 5@xmath18 corresponding to @xmath11700  au in length ( see figure  [ map ] ) .",
    "we assume a value of 20  k for the excitation temperature , we then derive a lower limit to the outflow mass @xmath31 .",
    "the correction factors due to optical depth and missing flux for the outflow mass of gm  tau are uncertain . however",
    ", the typical values of optical depths for class ii objects in taurus are from 1 to 5 @xcite . as gm  tau lies in the densest part of hcl  2 ( see figure  4 of @xcite ) , therefore , it is reasonable to assume an optical depth of five for the case of gm  tau .",
    "if a missing flux factor of three for sma @xcite is applicable here , we then obtain an upper limit to the outflow mass of @xmath32 .",
    "the maximum outflow velocity @xmath33 can be computed from the observed maximum outflow velocity and the outflow inclination .",
    "the observed maximum outflow velocity is about 1.2 km  s@xmath7 .",
    "based on optical , near - infrared and infrared data , @xcite performed disk modelling for gm  tau with a circumstellar geometry consisting of a rotationally flattened infalling envelope , bipolar cavities , and a flared accretion disk in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "their best - fitting model sed was obtained with the disk s inclination angle between 70@xmath2 and 80@xmath2 .",
    "we therefore use an average value of 75@xmath2 for the outflow inclination ( the angle between the outflow axis and the line of sight ) . from the observed maximum outflow velocity of 1.2 km  s@xmath7 and the outflow inclination angle @xmath34",
    ", we derive the maximum outflow velocity @xmath35  km  s@xmath7 .",
    "we then use this value to compute upper limit values for the kinematic and dynamic parameters .",
    "we find the momentum @xmath36",
    "@xmath4  km  s@xmath7 , the energy @xmath37  @xmath4  km@xmath38  s@xmath39 . from the outflow size of @xmath11700  au and the observed maximum outflow velocity of 1.2 km",
    "s@xmath7 , we derive the dynamical time @xmath40 for gm  tau of about 700  yr ( with a correction for the outflow inclination ) . with this dynamical time value",
    ", we then find the force @xmath41  @xmath4  km  s@xmath7  yr@xmath7 , and the mechanical luminosity @xmath42  l@xmath43 , where l@xmath43 is the solar luminosity .",
    "if we apply a correction for the optical depth factor of five and the missing flux factor of three for sma , these upper limit values will increase by a factor of fifteen .",
    "lower limits to these parameters could be estimated by using the outflow mass in each velocity channel and the space velocity of the outflow , which is assumed to be equal to the radial velocity of that channel , as if the gas was moving along the line of sight @xcite .",
    "this could be done for observations with good signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "however , as our detection levels of outflows in each velocity channel are rather low , we therefore do not estimate these lower limits .",
    "the mass - loss rate of molecular outflows can be computed by dividing the outflow mass by the dynamical time of the outflow .",
    "however , the estimated dynamical time @xmath44  yr for the outflow from gm  tau is over two orders of magnitude smaller than the age of vlm objects in taurus expected to be from a few @xmath45  yr to a few myrs @xcite .",
    "therefore , the correction factor of about ten applying for the outflow dynamical time of young low - mass stars @xcite may be not valid here .",
    "this value for vlm objects should be over a hundred ( see further discussion in sec .",
    "5.1 ) . without correction applied for the outflow dynamical time and using the lower and upper values of the outflow mass ,",
    "we directly derive lower and upper limits to the mass - loss rate of molecular outflows @xmath46 to be @xmath6@xmath4  yr@xmath7 and @xmath8@xmath4  yr@xmath7 , respectively .",
    "we now consider the possibility that the detected redshifted emission might be due to gravitationally bound motion and not outflow emission . for gravitationally bound motion ,",
    "an outflow size @xmath47  au with a velocity @xmath48  km  s@xmath7 would require an enclosed mass of @xmath498.4  @xmath4 ( @xmath50 , see @xcite ) .",
    "if we assume that the densest cores in taurus have been detected by @xcite ( see their table 2 ) , we then derive a possible largest mass of @xmath110.003  @xmath4 for a core of 700  au in diameter .",
    "in addition , we also estimate an upper limit to the mass of a core of 700 au using the gas density around the gm  tau position , which is estimated from the fcrao observations @xcite .",
    "the line intensity ratio between @xmath14co @xmath21 and @xmath15co @xmath21 is much smaller than the corresponding isotopic ratio , thus it is safe to assume that the @xmath14co line is optically thick .",
    "we then derive the gas excitation temperature of about 10  k based on the peak antenna temperature of @xmath14co .",
    "the @xmath15co opacity , and in turn , the gas column density can then be derived by assuming a [ @xmath15co]/[h@xmath51 abundance ratio of @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "the resulting h@xmath53 column density is @xmath54  cm@xmath39 , which is consistent with 2mass extinction measurement on arcminute spatial scale @xcite . using the measured h@xmath53 column density and the fwhm of the fcrao primary beam",
    ", we finally obtain an upper limit of @xmath110.13  @xmath4 to a core of 700  au within 25@xmath18 from the gm  tau position .",
    "both the estimated masses from the @xcite observations and fcrao are well below the enclosed mass of 8.4  @xmath4 required for gravitational bound motion .",
    "we therefore conclude that the detected emission is from the outflow .",
    "one should note that we did not detect the dust continuum emission with an upper limit of 1  mjy ( @xmath56 ) measured at the gm  tau position .",
    "so far , we have observed eight vlm objects and detected three of them having co molecular outflows : iso - oph 102 in @xmath9 ophiuchi @xcite , mho 5 @xcite and gm tau ( this paper ) in taurus .",
    "the molecular outflows from these three sources show similar molecular outflow properties : small scale of 6001000 au , low velocity of @xmath575 km  s@xmath7 ( with a correction of outflow inclination ) , tiny outflow mass of 10@xmath5810@xmath59  @xmath4 and low mass - loss rate of 10@xmath6010@xmath61  @xmath4yr@xmath7 .",
    "table  [ mloss ] lists these properties for each source .",
    "our molecular outflow mass estimates in vlm objects are smaller than the typical values 0.01@xmath200.7  @xmath4 of class ii low - mass stars ( g , k spectral types ; see @xcite and references therein ) by over an order of magnitude .    to estimate the mass - loss rate of the stellar wind that drives the molecular outflow in the vlm objects",
    ", we can assume that the stellar wind - molecular gas interaction is momentum - conserving ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we thus equate the momentum @xmath62 of the molecular outflow with that supplied by the wind over the outflow s lifetime ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "this yields the expression @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the wind velocity . for iso - oph  102 , the wind velocity is @xmath11107  km  s@xmath7 , which is estimated from @xmath66  45  km  s@xmath7 @xcite with a correction of outflow inclination of @xmath67 to the line of sight @xcite . for the cases of mho  5 and gm  tau , as no measurements of wind velocities have been reported so far , so we assume a wind velocity of about 100  km  s@xmath7 for these two objects . using the upper and lower limit values of outflow mass",
    "( see table  [ mloss ] ) , we derive the upper and lower limits ( table  [ comp ] ) to the wind mass - loss rates of the vlm objects , respectively .",
    "there is a possibility that our values of wind mass - loss rates are underestimated if the momentum from the wind might not be transferred all to the molecular gas .",
    "this happens when there is less molecular gas surrounding the source at late stages ( class ii ) than early stages ( class 0 , i ) .",
    "however , the wind mass - loss rates of vlm objects ( e.g. , iso - oph 102 ) estimated from molecular outflows ( see table  [ mloss ] ) are comparable to those derived from optical jets using the the spectro - astrometric method ( see table  6 in @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this implies that our values are not significantly underestimated .",
    "all these values of wind mass - loss rates of vlm objects are smaller than a typical value of @xmath1110@xmath61@xmath4  yr@xmath7 for class - ii low - mass stars of 0.55.0  @xmath4 @xcite by over about an order of magnitude ( see figure  [ comp ] ) .",
    "our results have shown that the outflow process occurs in vlm objects is a scaled - down version of that in low - mass stars .",
    "one should discuss here that the ratios of wind mass - loss rate to mass accretion rate @xmath68 in iso - oph  102 , mho  5 ( see table  [ comp ] ) are significantly higher than that in t  tauri stars ( @xmath110.0003 - 0.4 , @xcite ) .",
    "these high ratio values imply three possible scenarios : ( 1 ) first , we might underestimate the accretion rates as the accretion rates measured in the vlm objects at different epochs may vary over an order of magnitude on timescales of months to years ( e.g. , @xcite ) . therefore , the rates measured at particular epochs do not reflect the long - term accretion rates that are more appropriate for comparison with the outflow rates in the two vlm objects . however , the accretion rate in mho  5 measured at different epochs has suggested that the accretion rate is stable , @xmath69@xmath4  yr@xmath7 @xcite . in the case of iso - oph  102 ,",
    "the accretion rate of @xmath70@xmath4  yr@xmath7 was measured at epoch 2003.411 @xcite , and an increase of the accretion rate by a factor of five within a week was also observed @xcite",
    ". however , the accretion rate of @xmath71@xmath4  yr@xmath7 @xcite measured at epoch 2005.384 agrees with the natta et al.s measurement , suggesting a long - term accretion rate in iso - oph  012 of @xmath70@xmath4  yr@xmath7 .",
    "therefore , this scenario is unlikely the case here .",
    "\\(2 ) second , we might overestimate the wind mass - loss rate .",
    "this is due to that we did not apply a correction factor for the dynamical time ( see table  [ comp ] ) .",
    "if the estimated dynamical time is a lower limit to the real dynamical time , we then need to apply a correction factor of about 100 for the case of iso - oph  102 and 1000 for mho  5 as well as gm  tau ( see section  5.2 for further discussion ) , instead of 10 as estimated for low - mass stars @xcite , for the outflow dynamical time of vlm objects . the wind mass - loss rates , hence , the ratios @xmath68 will decrease by the same factors and they are thus comparable to those in t  tauri stars .",
    "\\(3 ) third , this ratio in vlm objects is really higher than that in low - mass stars .",
    "this is possibly due to a sudden drop of the mass accretion rate during the formation process of brown dwarfs as proposed by @xcite .",
    "further observations and theoretical works are needed to confirm these possible scenarios .",
    "the outflow dynamical times estimated for the three class - ii vlm objects , iso - oph 102 @xcite , mho  5 @xcite and gm  tau ( this paper ) are from @xmath72  yr to @xmath73  yr ( see table  [ mloss ] ) .",
    "these values are still about two or three orders of magnitude smaller than the ages of iso - oph  102 , gm  tau and mho  5 expected to be from a few @xmath45  yr ( iso - oph 102 , @xcite ) to a few myr ( gm  tau and mho  5 , see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the extreme discrepancy between the outflow dynamical time and the age of the vlm objects indicates two possibilities :    \\(1 ) the extent of outflows is not completely revealed because of the coverage and the sensitivity of our observations . for example , an outflow with velocity of 5  km  s@xmath7 and a dynamical time of @xmath45  yr will have a length of about 0.5 pc , or 12@xmath23 at the distance of taurus .",
    "this is more than an order of magnitude larger than the sma primary beam size .",
    "therefore , any molecular outflow emission that lies more than half a primary beam from the source would be impossible to detect .",
    "in addition , the full extent of outflows to the edge of the primary beam has not been detected ( e.g. , iso - oph 102 , see fig . 1 in @xcite ) , which is possibly due to the sensitivity limit of sma .",
    "the estimated outflow dynamical time is thus a lower limit to the true outflow duration as discussed in @xcite for the case of low - mass stars .",
    "\\(2 ) the outflow process in the vlm objects is episodic , occurring in class ii with duration of a few @xmath74  yr . an episodic outflow will have a discrete blob morphology . in this case ,",
    "other blobs of the molecular outflows from our vlm objects that lie outside the primary beam would not be detected .",
    "the outflows detected by sma are thus from the last active episodes .",
    "if the episodicity of these outflows is confirmed , the outflow process in vlm objects will include quiescent and active episodes .",
    "one then can expect that the accretion associated with outflow is also episodic .",
    "this is consistent with evolutionary models as proposed by @xcite that the accretion process in bds at early stages could be episodic , including long quiescent phases of accretion interrupted by short episodes ( a few @xmath74 to @xmath75  yr ) of high accretion .",
    "their evolutionary models taking into account episodic phases of accretion successfully explain the significant luminosity spread observed in h - r diagrams of star - forming regions .",
    "more extended and deeper observations are therefore needed to explore the morphology of the outflows from these vlm objects in order to confirm the scenarios .",
    "the outflow masses and the mass - loss rates of the molecular outflows from iso - oph 102 , gm  tau and mho  5 , which are class ii objects , are comparable to those of l1014-irs @xcite , a proto bd candidate at a younger age ( class 0/i ) that has an outflow with a mass and mass - loss rate of @xmath1110@xmath76  @xmath4 and @xmath77  @xmath4yr@xmath7 , respectively . in the case of the class i proto bd candidate l1148-irs @xcite ,",
    "the outflow mass ( @xmath1110@xmath78  @xmath4 ) and the mass - loss rate ( @xmath1110@xmath61  @xmath4yr@xmath7 ) are slightly larger than that from our vlm objects but still comparable to the range of our lower and upper limits ( see table  [ mloss ] ) .",
    "this similarity implies that the mass - loss rate , hence the associated wind mass - loss and accretion rates in vlm objects do not significantly change in different formation stages ( from class 0/i to class ii ) .",
    "as discussed in section  5.1 , the ratio of wind mass - loss rate to accretion rate @xmath68 in vlm objects is possibly higher than that in low - mass stars ( table  [ comp ] ) . if the wind mass - loss rate does not significantly change for different classes of vlm object formation , 10@xmath7910@xmath80  @xmath4yr@xmath7 ( see table  [ comp ] ) , then",
    ", one may expect that this ratio also holds in earlier classes , such as classes 0 , i. this suggests that the accretion rate in vlm objects expected to be also in the range 10@xmath7910@xmath60  @xmath4yr@xmath7 at earlier stages .",
    "the starlike models for bd formation predict that vlm cores produced by fragmentation @xcite are dense enough to be gravitationally unstable .",
    "the detection of such a vlm core @xcite supports these models .",
    "our observations suggest that these vlm cores may undergo some active episodes of outflow and associated accretion with duration of a few @xmath74  yr . the accretion rates , however , are very low , in the range 10@xmath7910@xmath60  @xmath4yr@xmath7 or lower , and they are comparable or smaller than the mass - loss rate .",
    "this may therefore prevent the vlm cores to accrete enough material to become a star .",
    "here , we report our latest search for molecular outflows from vlm objects .",
    "so far , we have detected molecular outflows from two bds ( one in @xmath9 ophiuchi and one in taurus ) and one vlm star in taurus .",
    "our results suggest that : ( 1 ) the bipolar molecular outflow process in vlm objects is a scaled - down version of that in low - mass stars ; ( 2 ) the outflow mass - loss and the associated mass accretion processes in vlm objects are possibly episodic with duration of a few thousand years ; ( 3 ) the outflow mass - loss rate and the mass accretion rate during active episodes are very low and they do not significantly change for different stages of the formation process of vlm objects ; ( 4 ) a very low mass accretion rate , possibly together with a high ratio of outflow mass - loss rate to mass accretion rate , may prevent a vlm core to accrete enough gas to become a star ; and thus the core will end up a bd .",
