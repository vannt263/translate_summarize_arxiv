    "the vector spaces consist of differentials of geometric values related to @xmath1 , @xmath2 and the triangulation .",
    "such chain complexes turn out to be acyclic in many cases , and the reidemeister torsion for complexes of this kind can be used for constructing a wide range of manifold invariants .",
    "most of the work already done in this direction deals with the situation where @xmath25 is a three - dimensional euclidean space , @xmath26 is its group of motions and @xmath21 is a three - dimensional manifold .",
    "we will mention in this paper some of our works concerning this case ; the latest achievement here was the construction of a finite - dimensional topological quantum field theory ( tqft )  @xcite in the spirit of m.  atiyah s axioms  @xcite .",
    "other chain complexes for three - manifolds studied by us correspond to @xmath2 being an affine ( real or complex ) plane and @xmath1  the group of its motions _ preserving the areas _",
    "@xcite , and also to @xmath2 being a four - dimensional euclidean space , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 being its group of motions  @xcite ( thus , both two- and four - dimensional homogeneous spaces  @xmath2 proved to be good for studying _",
    "three_-manifolds ) .",
    "a chain complex for _ four_-manifolds has also been suggested where @xmath27 and @xmath29  @xcite .    at this stage",
    "it is , however , too early to speak about a general recipe of how to construct a chain complex for an @xmath30-dimensional manifold , given a group  @xmath1 and its homogeneous space  @xmath2 .",
    "our current work consists rather in constructing and studying complexes for specific @xmath1 and  @xmath2 . in the present paper ,",
    "we investigate the case of @xmath31  the compactified complex plane and @xmath32  the group of its fractional - linear transformations .",
    "our interest in this case was initially stimulated by the fact that it uses , as the reader will see below , some constructions known from hyperbolic geometry ; it turned out later that there are also many new and beautiful features distinguishing this case from what was known earlier .    below , in sections [ sec : cr ] and  [ right ] we construct what we call the basic complex  a chain complex which is , in a sense , the simplest possible one , and which is suitable for modifications used for various specific purposes .",
    "this construction goes in a somewhat unexpected way : we use some geometric considerations in section  [ sec : cr ] for constructing a half of the complex , and some rather different , at first sight , considerations in section  [ right ] for constructing its second half ; the possibility to unite the two halves comes like a miracle .",
    "then , in section  [ sec : twisted ] we construct a twisted version of the complex and prove its important property  acyclicity . in section  [ sec :",
    "moves ] we produce manifold invariants using twisted complexes . in section",
    "[ sec : examples ] we provide some examples , together with one more  relative  version of our complex in subsection  [ subsec : relative ] .",
    "finally , we discuss our results and further research in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "to begin , we consider a three - dimensional closed oriented manifold  @xmath21 . we attach a complex number  @xmath33 to every vertex  @xmath34 of its given triangulation ; @xmath33 will be called the unperturbed , or initial , coordinate of vertex  @xmath34 .",
    "these @xmath35 s are parameters of our theory , of which the final result will not depend .",
    "the only condition on @xmath35 s is that they must lie in the general position with regard to all algebraic constructions given below .",
    "now we define mappings  @xmath36 , @xmath37 and  @xmath38 .",
    "mapping  @xmath36 sends an element of group  @xmath0 represented by matrix @xmath39 into the column vector of height @xmath40 consisting of `` perturbed coordinates '' @xmath41 for all vertices  @xmath34 ; here @xmath40 is the number of vertices in the triangulation of  @xmath21 .",
    "the next mapping  @xmath37 sends a column vector of @xmath40 arbitrary values @xmath42 into a column vector of height  @xmath43 , where @xmath43 is the number of _ tetrahedra _ in the triangulation .",
    "each entry of this latter vector corresponds to a tetrahedron in the triangulation and is described as follows .",
    "let there be a tetrahedron  @xmath44 , whose orientation , given by this order of its vertices , corresponds to the given orientation of  @xmath21 .",
    "the entry of the mentioned vector , corresponding to tetrahedron  @xmath44 , consists of three complex values corresponding to its six _ unoriented _ edges and related as follows :    * the same value corresponds to any of two opposite edges : if @xmath45 corresponds to edge  @xmath46 , it also corresponds to edge  @xmath47 ; * if @xmath45 corresponds to edges @xmath46 and  @xmath47 , then the first of the values @xmath48 corresponds to any of the edges 03 and 12 , while the second  to the edges 01 and  23 .    by definition , the  @xmath45 obtained by applying @xmath37 to given  @xmath49 s ( where the actual tetrahedron vertices must be substituted instead of @xmath50 ) is the cross - ratio @xmath51 where @xmath52 one can check that expressions ( [ 2more ] ) are in accordance with how the cross - ratio  ( [ cr ] ) transforms under permutations of vertices .",
    "finally , mapping  @xmath38 sends a column vector of height  @xmath43 consisting of triples  @xmath53 into a column vector of complex numbers  @xmath54 of height  @xmath55 , where @xmath55 is the number of edges in the triangulation , and @xmath56 is a given edges joining vertices @xmath34 and  @xmath57 .",
    "consider the _ star _ of edge  @xmath56 ; it consists of all tetrahedra having @xmath56 as an edge . by definition , @xmath38 yields @xmath58",
    "where all values @xmath45 in the product correspond to all tetrahedra in the star of  @xmath56 and to the edge  @xmath56 in each such tetrahedron .",

    "[ th - l - glob ] the composition of any two successive arrows in  ( [ crmacro ] ) is a constant mapping .    to show that @xmath60 , it is enough to say that the cross - ratio of four complex numbers is invariant under the action of the same element of  @xmath0 on all of them .    to show that @xmath61 , note that all terms in the product  ( [ oij ] ) of values  ( [ cr ] ) cancel out .",
    "we sometimes call the chain  ( [ crmacro ] ) a `` macroscopic '' complex , in contrast to its differential , or `` microscopic '' version which we are going to produce . roughly speaking",
    ", it will consist of differentials of mappings @xmath36 , @xmath37 and  @xmath38 .",
    "this makes no difficulty when taking the differential @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the lie algebra , and by @xmath64 we denote the vector space of column vectors of differentials of quantities  @xmath49 .",
    "more formally , @xmath64 is just a vector space over  @xmath65 whose basis consists of all the vertices of triangulation . to be exact , we represent @xmath63 as a space of column vectors with components @xmath66 , and define @xmath67 by the formula @xmath68 for all vertices  @xmath34 .",
    "for the next mapping , we would like , however , to have if not one elegantly defined `` symmetric '' quantity instead of ( [ cr ] ) and  ( [ 2more ] ) , then at least a simple differential not depending on the choice of an edge in the tetrahedron . for this , we propose @xmath69 where @xmath70 similarly to  ( [ zij ] ) . note , by the way , that such @xmath71 does not even change even under _ odd _ permutations of indices @xmath50 .",
    "thus , our mapping @xmath72 is defined by differentiating formula  [ cr ] ; here @xmath73 is the space of column vectors whose coordinates are  @xmath74 for all tetrahedra  @xmath75 in the triangulation or , more formally , a vector space over  @xmath65 whose basis consists of all the tetrahedra .",
    "the formula for  @xmath76 is : @xmath77 and similarly for other indices .    finally , we introduce also logarithms of @xmath78 s in our definition of `` microscopic '' mapping  @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is again the obvious vector space , whose basis vectors are edges .",
    "we define @xmath81 by formula @xmath82 where `` edges @xmath83 '' are all edges belonging to the link of @xmath56 and @xmath75 gives the right orientation of every tetrahedron .",
    "the following theorem is an obvious consequence of theorem  [ th - l - glob ] .",

    "[ right ] , we will see how the complex  ( [ crmicro ] ) can be continued to the right , and we will produce its `` right - hand half '' .",
    "even after this , the resulting complex , literally taken , will be just the basis for building its different modifications useful for calculating topological invariants and building a tqft  this is why we call ( [ crmicro ] ) the left - hand half of the basic complex .",

    "we assume that our isotropic vectors come out of the origin of coordinates .",
    "the map @xmath98 produces then , by definition , squared distances  @xmath99 between the ends of @xmath92 and  @xmath100 .",
    "note the following relation with the scalar product : @xmath101    finally , our space `` @xmath102 '' consists of complex numbers  @xmath103 put in correspondence to all tetrahedra  @xmath75 . by definition ,",
    "the @xmath104 s produced by  @xmath105 from the given squared edge lengths are the following determinants : @xmath106 where of course @xmath107 and so on .",
    "[ th - g - global ] the composition of any two successive arrows in  ( [ crmacroconj ] ) is a constant mapping .",
    "the relation @xmath108 holds simply because distances are invariant under the action of @xmath88 .    the relation @xmath109 holds because @xmath104 vanishes when the @xmath110 s are produced from _ three - dimensional _ vectors according to  ( [ lij ] ) .",
    "now we pass on to `` microscopic '' values in full analogy with section  [ sec : cr ] and prove the following theorem  analogue of theorem  [ th - f ]  as an obvious consequence of theorem  [ th - g - global ] .",

    "the tildes in theorem  [ th - g ] are because we actually want to slightly modify the complex  ( [ crmicroconj ] ) by normalizing the bases in its vector spaces so as to make us able to join ( [ crmicro ] ) and  ( [ crmicroconj ] ) together in a single chain complex in the way described below .",
    "but first we must choose a basis in the lie algebra  @xmath115 .",
    "by definition , it will consist of the following three standard generators : @xmath116    let @xmath117 be infinitesimal numbers ; here and below we mark with a star certain differentials , having in mind that we are going to `` transpose '' complex  ( [ crmicroconj ] ) as described below , then the corresponding differentials without stars will enter in the transposed complex .",
    "we would like also to denote @xmath118 if we calculate the change of @xmath93 and  @xmath42 under the action of matrix @xmath119 on vector @xmath92  ( [ ei ] ) and then substitute the initial values @xmath120 and @xmath121 into the resulting jacobian matrix , we get , taking also ( [ alpha*beta * ] ) into account : @xmath122 formula  ( [ g1 ] ) gives our definition for linear mapping  @xmath123  the modified version of @xmath124 from  ( [ crmicroconj ] ) .",
    "next , we introduce normalized squared edge lengths in the following way : @xmath125 thus , when @xmath126 is obtained according to @xmath98 , it is @xmath127 this yields @xmath128 by definition , formula  ( [ g2 ] ) gives matrix elements for linear mapping  @xmath129  the modified version of @xmath130 from  ( [ crmicroconj ] ) .    finally , if @xmath103 is obtained according to  @xmath105 and we calculate the derivative @xmath131 at the point where @xmath132 and similarly for @xmath110 s with other indices , we get @xmath133 where in the product both @xmath134 and @xmath135 take values @xmath136 , and `` @xmath137 '' in `` @xmath138 '' means just the alphabetic order .",
    "this suggests us to denote @xmath139 which yields @xmath140 by definition , gives matrix elements for linear mapping  @xmath141  the modified version of @xmath142 in  ( [ crmicroconj ] ) .",
    "hence , the modified version of   is @xmath143    comparing ( [ yphi ] ) with ( [ dlnomega ] ) , we see that @xmath81 and  @xmath141 are related by matrix transposing : @xmath144 this remarkable observation is the key for joining together our complexes and  .",
    "namely , here is our final basic complex : @xmath145 by definition , in @xmath146 as for the vector spaces , first , @xmath147 is just a new notation for the same  @xmath80 in  , which is justified by the fact that @xmath148 , according to  .",

    "as we have already stated , we are going to use our basic complex   mainly as a starting point for various modifications .",
    "one important modification is a complex twisted by a representation  @xmath154 of the fundamental group @xmath155 of our considered manifold  @xmath21 into the group  @xmath156 .",
    "this construction is similar to what we have done for the `` euclidean '' case  @xcite and goes , in a few words , as follows :    1 .",
    "[ i1 ] we bring into consideration the _ universal cover _  @xmath157 of  @xmath21 , to whose vertices we now assign `` coordinate '' parameters in a way consistent with  @xmath154 ; 2 .   [ i2 ]",
    "we add the parameters of the possible deformations of  @xmath154 to the second ( nonzero ) terms _ both from the left and from the right _ in sequence  ; 3 .",
    "[ i3 ] we reduce the first terms both from the left and from the right  the lie algebra and its dual  to the subalgebra commuting with the whole representation  @xmath154 and the dual space to that subalgebra .",
    "this all goes mostly in the same way as in the `` euclidean '' case ; below are some more details .",
    "item  ( [ i1 ] ) : we assign coordinates @xmath158 and  @xmath35 to the vertices of @xmath157 in a way consistent with representation  @xmath154 : this means that for any two vertices @xmath159 lying above the same vertex  @xmath160 , if @xmath161 is the element taking the first of them into the second : @xmath162 , then @xmath163 here @xmath164 is understood as the element of @xmath88 in the sense of section  [ right ] ; the corresponding element of the isomorphic group  @xmath0 is the fractional - linear transformation of @xmath35 s determined by  . otherwise , the coordinates are arbitrary with the only condition of general position with respect to all our algebraic constructions .",
    "when we ( slightly ) deform these `` initial '' coordinates , their respective values must still obey the same restriction as  ( [ ini - hz ] ) , i.e. , @xmath165 this means that , in the `` microscopic '' complex  , the differentials @xmath166 and  @xmath167 for different copies of the same vertex  @xmath34 can be obtained one from another by differentiating formula  ( [ hz ] ) .",
    "so , the second nonzero terms from both sides in   are now modified as follows : they contain the differentials @xmath166 and  @xmath167 ( the left one just  @xmath167 , of course ) for _ one _ `` main '' copy ( lying in  @xmath157 and arbitrarily chosen ) of each vertex  @xmath160 . according to the general definition  [ dfn : family ] below in section  [ sec : moves ] ,",
    "these `` main '' copies form a _ fundamental family _ of vertices in  @xmath157 .    item  ( [ i2 ] ) : we assume that @xmath154 is a _ regular _ point in the space of all representations @xmath168 in the sense that its neighborhood  all near representations  can be parameterized ( smoothly enough ) by some number of parameters . to be exact , by `` representation '' we understand here a _ class of equivalent _ representations .",
    "we assume also that we are able to choose one specific representative in each class of equivalent representations , and these representatives are also smoothly parameterized by the same parameters . such a specific representative is needed to calculate the deformed coordinates of all copies of vertices in  @xmath157 from their `` main '' copies .",
    "this is done , of course , according to the same formula  ( [ hz ] ) but now with the deformed  @xmath154 .",
    "one more modification to the second nonzero term from the left in   is adding there the vector space  @xmath169 of all the infinitesimal representation deformation parameters ; the corresponding change for the second nonzero term from the right is adding the dual space  @xmath170 .",
    "item  ( [ i3 ] ) : we denote the subalgebra of @xmath63 commuting with  @xmath154 as @xmath171 ; the @xmath154 here is of course undeformed .    here is how we write the resulting twisted complex : @xmath172      [ th - acyclicity ] complex   is acyclic for any closed oriented triangulated three - dimensional manifold  @xmath21 , i.e. , sequence   is _ exact _ : the image of any mapping coincides with the kernel of the next mapping .    below in subsection",
    "[ acyclic - generalities ] , we give also the definition of acyclicity from a homological viewpoint , see definition  [ dfn : acycl ] .",
    "the rest of this subsection contains the proof of theorem  [ th - acyclicity ] .",
    "it is divided into two parts : acyclicity in the first three terms ( from the left ) in  , i.e. , before the arrow  @xmath81 , and acyclicity in the second three terms .",
    "this proof goes in a direct analogy with the `` euclidean '' case , see  @xcite for the most detailed exposition .",

    "so , the key issue here is to prove ( [ j3 ] ) .",
    "we begin with choosing coordinates  @xmath49 for one arbitrarily chosen `` initial '' tetrahedron .",
    "coordinates are arbitrary except that they must have the required cross - ratio  @xmath45 .",
    "we say then that we have associated a _",
    "coordinate system _ with this initial tetrahedron .",
    "then , we extend this coordinate system to tetrahedra having a common 2-face with the initial tetrahedron , which goes in a unique way given the @xmath45 s and these adjacent tetrahedra , and continue this procees to the next adjacent tetrahedra and so on .",
    "the vanishing deficit angles guarantee that the thus obtained coordinate system in any tetrahedron does not depend on the specific way joining it with the initial tetrahedron ( recall also that we are in the simply connected universal cover  @xmath157 ) . from the coordinates of vertices in  @xmath157",
    "we can also extract the ( deformed ) representation @xmath179 .",
    "second comes the transition from macroscopic to microscopic situation , i.e. , to the left - hand half of complex  .",
    "this uses the fact that the initial coordinates  @xmath35 are in general position and goes quite similarly to such transition in the `` euclidean '' situation of  @xcite .",
