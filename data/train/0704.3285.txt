    "the discovery that the universe is dominated by dark energy strongly suggests that the predictions of standard cosmology should be reevaluated .",
    "an intriguing possible explanation of the nature of dark energy arises within the quintessence paradigm , in which the dark energy takes the form of a slowly evolving scalar field ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this scenario is extremely difficult ( if not impossible ) to test directly in collider experiments , since quintessence models generically require the quintessence field to have gravitationally suppressed interactions with the fields of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "however , if the dark energy is in the form of quintessence , the presence of the quintessence field can modify the cosmological evolution and lead to significant departures from standard cosmology .",
    "a striking example is the possible interconnection of dark matter and dark energy within quintessence scenarios @xcite .",
    "as first pointed out by salati @xcite , the freeze - out of thermal relics can be strongly enhanced in scenarios in which the energy density is dominated by the kinetic energy of the quintessence field ( kination domination ) during the time of freeze - out , but dilutes away by the time of big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) .",
    "( related scenarios were also suggested before by @xcite . )",
    "such kination dominated freeze - out scenarios are then consistent with standard cosmology and predict that the standard relic abundance computed from the parameters extracted from collider measurements will be mismatched from the relic abundance deduced by observational cosmology .",
    "this has implications for tev physics models with thermal dark matter candidates ( e.g. models with low energy supersymmetry such as the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm ) , technicolor models , models with large / warped extra dimensions , or certain classes of little higgs models ) , which will be probed at the lhc and other experiments in the foreseeable future .    in most of the previous discussions of this class of scenarios",
    "@xcite , the initial condition that the quintessence field kinetic energy density is the dominant component was put in as an ansatz , without a complete picture of the inflationary dynamics . in this paper , we address this issue by constructing an inflationary scenario that dynamically leads to a kination dominated quintessence period .",
    "this yields robust predictions which can be used to experimentally support or rule out this class of scenarios .    to construct viable inflationary models which lead to kination domination",
    ", the following constraints must be satisfied :    1 .",
    "the energy density in a coherent quintessence field must dominate over radiation after the end of inflation .",
    "2 .   the quintessence field must be kinetic energy dominated .",
    "3 .   the inflaton potential must satisfy the usual requirements of a sufficient number of efoldings , the right amplitude of density perturbations , and a nearly scale invariant spectral index ( with a slight preference for a red spectrum @xcite ) .",
    "4 .   there must not be too much reheating in the phase transition at the end of inflation ( when the quasi - de sitter phase ends ) , such that the ratio of the kination energy density to the radiation energy density can be large .    to satisfy these constraints",
    ", we build a model in which the quintessence field is the inflaton field @xmath0 , which has sufficiently weak couplings to the sm fields at the end of inflation such that most of the energy density responsible for inflation gets converted to @xmath0 coherent kinetic energy in a runaway potential .",
    "radiation domination is achieved because the coherent kinetic energy dilutes as @xmath1 , while the suppressed radiation produced at the end of inflation gets relatively amplified since it dilutes as @xmath2 .",
    "the choice of the inflaton as the quintessence field in kination domination is natural in this framework , since the inflaton possesses the required qualities for the kination domination construction : energy dominance and coherence .",
    "other quintessence models have been constructed in which the inflaton is the same field as the quintessence field ( see e.g. @xcite ) , but we treat the reheating more precisely and derive new predictions in the context of kination - dominated quintessence models relevant for dark matter . the work @xcite considers the connection between dark energy and dark matter , but it differs from the present treatment in that their scenario is model specific and has multiple inflationary phases .",
    "in addition to the prediction that the relic abundance inferred from collider measurements can measurably disagree with the cosmologically inferred dark matter relic abundance ( in the context of a thermal freeze - out scenario ) , many experimentally accessible cosmological predictions can be made by embedding the kination domination scenario in inflationary models .",
    "the most _ model independent _ nontrivial prediction is the absence of a measurable tensor perturbation induced b - mode cmb polarization .",
    "hence , the next generation of cmb experiments can falsify this class of models .",
    "other predictions include a shift in the peak of the gravity wave signal from the electroweak phase transition , shifts in the verifiable leptogenesis / baryogenesis scenarios whose out of equilibrium ingredient is furnished by @xmath3 , and shifts in any residual annihilation effects . in general , the indirect dark matter detection signals are enhanced in this scenario @xcite . in particular , it would be interesting to see whether one can explain the positron excess as observed by heat and other experiments near 7 gev within this scenario @xcite , since most attempts to explain this excess in terms of dark matter annihilations require sufficiently large cross sections that the relic abundance would be negligible with standard cosmological assumptions .",
    "the order of presentation will be as follows .",
    "we begin by analyzing both analytically and numerically the constraints on quintessence potentials to achieve a period of kination domination , and look for equation of state signatures . in section [ sec : inflation ] , we construct a class of inflationary models embedding the kination domination scenario and discuss a robust prediction that can observationally falsify this class of models . in section",
    "[ sec : otherpredictions ] , we discuss other observationally accessible cosmological predictions which may corroborate this class of scenarios .",
    "we then summarize and conclude . in the appendix , we provide the details of the particle production computation for the unusual reheating scenario associated with this class of inflationary scenarios .    throughout this paper , we use the convention of @xmath4 to denote the reduced planck mass of approximately @xmath5 gev .",
    "the standard procedure in constructing scenarios of quintessence dynamics is to focus on potentials , which is a sensible approach since a negative equation of state requires potential energy domination .",
    "however , when considering quintessence dynamics with a period of kination domination , it is more natural to focus on the behavior of the field velocity , as this is the quantity which characterizes the energy density of the quintessence field .",
    "here we develop a formalism to map the desired behavior of the kinetic energy to a class of scalar potentials .",
    "our results show that the allowed quintessence potentials are not severely restricted by the requirement of a period of kination domination , since the time at which the equation of state is close to @xmath6 is necessarily much later than the time of dark matter freeze - out due to the strong constraints from bbn . in what follows",
    ", we will not restrict ourselves to  tracker \" models , in order to separate the difficulties of constructing good trackers from the constraints imposed by kination domination .",
    "it is worth noting that kination dominated initial conditions can be obtained in tracking potentials , as discussed in @xcite , although clearly there will be constraints depending on the exact form of the potential .    to carry out the engineering of quintessence potentials which match the desired kinetic term histories , we begin with the familiar equations of motion for the quintessence field @xmath0 and the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) scale factor @xmath7 : @xmath8 @xmath9 in which @xmath10 corresponds to the energy densities of radiation and matter . using the following definitions , @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13 we rewrite eqs .",
    "( [ quinteom ] ) and ( [ frw ] ) as follows : @xmath14\\label{eq : eom}\\ ] ] @xmath15 in the above , we have assumed that @xmath16 is a single valued function of @xmath0 ( which would exclude e.g. the situation of oscillations ) .",
    "for the scenarios considered here this is typically not a good assumption throughout the entire evolution , since the kinetic energy is usually large enough that @xmath0 can overshoot the minimum and eventually hit the `` other side '' of the potential before the quintessence equation of state reaches @xmath6 .",
    "however , the condition on the quintessence potential during kination domination does not change even if this behavior is properly accounted for since the `` bounce '' occurs long after the kination period is over .",
    "we can use eqs .",
    "( [ eq : eom])([eq : hubble ] ) to solve for @xmath17 and @xmath18 if @xmath19 is given ; alternatively , we can solve for @xmath19 and @xmath17 if the field velocity function @xmath18 ( _ i.e. _ the kinetic energy ) is specified . for generic potentials , there is no obvious obstruction to achieving a period of kination domination which leads to a period of potential energy domination , as @xmath18 can be chosen to vanish as @xmath0 approaches a particular asymptotic value , and the hubble friction naturally allows for @xmath18 to vanish without @xmath20 also vanishing .    in this paper , we restrict our attention to the specific case of the quintessence field velocity function with the initial behavior ( during the time relevant for dark matter freeze - out ) of @xmath21 in which @xmath22 and @xmath23 denote initial values of the functions @xmath18 and @xmath17 .",
    "this corresponds to the kination regime in which the universe is driven by quintessence kinetic energy , with @xmath24 playing a subdominant role compared to @xmath25 in the equation of motion for @xmath0 ( _ i.e. _ , the force term is subdominant to the hubble friction term ) .",
    "the reason of course for this restriction is that kination domination gives rise to an energy density which dilutes as @xmath1 , which allows the quintessence energy to be important during dm freeze - out but disappear by the time of bbn as required by phenomenology .",
    "let us now study what a potential that leads to the kination behavior of eq .",
    "( [ eq : kinationdef ] ) looks like by constructing it using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : eom ] ) and ( [ eq : hubble ] ) . to obtain a closed form solution",

    "the validity of neglecting @xmath24 can be rewritten as @xmath30 one trivial way to make @xmath24 negligible is to have @xmath20 much smaller than any other energy component and to have @xmath20 be a smooth function . another way to satisfy eq .",
    "( [ eq : neglectcase1 ] ) is to set its left hand side equal to an arbitrary small function @xmath31 and solve for @xmath18 .",

    ". note that since @xmath37 is arbitrary , nearly any smoothly varying @xmath18 can be obtained , which in turn means any smoothly varying shape for the potential can be obtained even with the constraint of eq .",

    "although eq .",
    "( [ eq : frewritten ] ) can be used to write the solution as a single integral , the phase space of solutions can also be visualized by examining this equation . as long as @xmath44 , @xmath43 moves towards @xmath45 ( @xmath46 at the time of bbn ) .",
    "the existence of a large class of solutions given by @xmath44 is not surprising given that the hubble expansion generically provides friction for the field velocity @xmath28 .",

    "although a larger @xmath42 seems to correspond to a shorter time to achieve the desired @xmath47 , it also implies that the potential is larger , which places severe constraints on @xmath42 .",
    "more explicitly , it can be shown that the potential of eq .",

    "the main lesson from the discussion thus far is that potentials can be chosen to not interfere with @xmath69 behavior of the quintessence energy density even past the point in which the radiation starts to dominate .",

    "the main lesson to be learned from this exercise is that in viable kination scenarios , the dark energy equation of state can exhibit a wide range of behavior both because of the shape of the potential and because of the unknown initial conditions .",

    "athough the relativistic species @xmath135 initially is out of equilibrium , the energy density can be characterized by an approximate temperature @xmath156 .",
    "as we will discuss below , @xmath135 will eventually equilibrate and the relativistic energy density will dilute as @xmath2 .    in this class of scenarios , the initial values of @xmath157 and @xmath158",
    "are interconnected , such that for any given reheating energy density @xmath157 , there is a predicted value of @xmath35 , which is phenomenologically required to be less than about 1 ( at @xmath159 ) by the time the photon temperature is of order @xmath160 mev . since @xmath161 during the kination period , @xmath162 is given by @xmath163 combining eqs .",
    "( [ eq : hawkingenergy ] ) and ( [ eq : etadesired ] ) , we find that in order to obtain a desired @xmath104 , the inflationary energy density must be of the form @xmath164 a larger @xmath104 requires a smaller @xmath147 , because the radiation energy density at the end of inflation is proportional to @xmath165 , and an increased radiation energy density corresponds to an increased scale factor growth before the temperature reaches 1 mev .",
    "( [ eq : v0sol ] ) is a remarkable result as it sets an approximate upper bound on @xmath147 if a non - negligible @xmath104 is to be achieved .",
    "note that this did not depend on the details of the inflationary model , but only on the fact that a period of kination domination occurs just following inflation together with reheating .",
    "although such upper bounds have not been imposed in previous studies @xcite , this result appears to be quite generic within a large class of inflationary models .",
    "an interesting ramification of this bound on @xmath166 results from the fact that the detection of inflationary tensor perturbations in the foreseeable future requires @xmath167 ( corresponding to a tensor to scalar ratio of about @xmath168 ) @xcite . hence ,",
    "if tensor perturbations are detected , @xmath162 must satisfy the following approximate bound : @xmath169 in the above , @xmath170 is the ratio of the potential between the time when the largest observable scales left the horizon and the time when inflation ends , and @xmath171 is the minimum detectable tensor to scalar ratio defined as @xmath172 evaluated at the @xmath173 hubble crossing scale , where @xmath174 is the usual potential expansion slow roll parameter . therefore , larger values of @xmath162 would be ruled out in this scenario if tensor perturbations are measured .",
    "note that a nonzero @xmath175 causes an @xmath176 change in the prediction of the relic abundance compared to the standard scenario @xcite . in the event of a positive tensor perturbation measurement , @xmath162",
    "would be bounded to be so small that kination dominated scenarios can not be effective in changing the thermal relic abundance from the values obtained using standard cosmology ( _ i.e. _ , the connection between collider measurements and dark energy would be lost ) .",
    "the constraint for obtaining the required number of efolds is given by:@xmath177 in which @xmath178 is the expansion rate today , and in our scenario the reheating temperature @xmath179 , indicating that the explicit @xmath180 dependence drops out of eq .",
    "( [ eq : efold ] ) .",
    "the requisite number of efoldings is slightly larger than the usual inflationary scenario with reheating during coherent oscillations since there is no corresponding scale stretching that would have occurred during the coherent oscillations phase .",
    "as there is no explicit @xmath180 dependence , for @xmath181 the required number of efolds of inflation is @xmath182 nearly independently of the inflationary potential .",
    "note that in the absence of an unusual initial state of the vacuum , the number of efolds required after the onset of inflation to achieve the usual inflationary predictions is very small @xcite .    since @xmath166 is fixed by eq .",
    "( [ eq : v0sol ] ) and @xmath183 is fixed by the density perturbation constraint @xmath184 @xmath137 is approximately given by @xmath185 for this class of models @xmath186 , which implies that @xmath187 during the approximate 70 efoldings of interest since the potential depends only logarithmically on @xmath0 during inflation .",
    "nonetheless , it is still useful to keep the @xmath188 dependence explicitly to keep track of the model dependence , since expressions like eq .",
    "( [ eq : exclusion ] ) are not strongly dependent on the shape of the inflationary potential .    to determine the very model dependent field value during which @xmath189 leaves the horizon ( corresponding to about 68 efoldings before the end of inflation ) , we use the usual field integral over @xmath190 , which yields @xmath191 eq .",
    "( [ eq : observablescales ] ) implies that unless there is fine tuning of the initial conditions , the number of efoldings will be much larger than the requisite number of eq .",
    "( [ eq : requiredefolds ] ) .",
    "finally , the end of inflation , which is determined by @xmath192 ( since afterwards @xmath0 rolls quickly to make @xmath193 ) , is given by @xmath194 which means that inflation ends very close to @xmath195 ( by construction ) and far away from scales of interest of eq .",
    "( [ eq : observablescales ] ) .",
    "this places a constraint on the steplike function @xmath196 , since the slow roll behavior should not be disrupted by the slope of this steplike function before the required number of efoldings of inflation .",
    "for example , if @xmath197)/2 $ ] , @xmath144 is bounded by @xmath198 it is also straightforward to show that in order for @xmath0 kination domination to occur at the end of inflation , the potential that kicks @xmath0 must satisfy the following condition : @xmath199 a much less stringent constraint than eq .",
    "( [ eq : alphacond ] ) . finally , as we have commented near eq .",
    "( [ eq : potentialwithstep ] ) , we now see explicitly that if we make @xmath200 for @xmath201 , @xmath138 does not change the inflationary analysis .",
    "we have checked the details of this inflationary scenario with explicit numerical computations .",
    "the analytic discussion above is in good agreement with the numerical results .      the steplike feature in the potential presented in eq .",
    "( [ eq : potentialwithstep ] ) suggests an interesting new classical equation of motion which is exactly solvable that is relevant for this class of scenarios .",
    "if gravity is turned off and the @xmath202 term is neglected , the equation of motion for the coherent state of @xmath0 at the end of inflation can be written as@xmath203 in which we have omitted the negligible contribution proportional to @xmath204 .",
    "this class of potentials allows us to now rewrite this equation in the limit @xmath205 ( the limit of interest according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : alphacond ] ) ) as follows : @xmath206 the parameter @xmath144 has disappeared from the equation of motion ; this is not surprising given the stepfunction - like behavior of the potential in this limit .",
    "the beauty of eq .",
    "( [ eq : approximatedsol ] ) is that it can be solved exactly .",
    "the solution is given by @xmath207 where @xmath208 is a stepfunction , @xmath209 , @xmath210 and @xmath211 are initial values of the field and its velocity at time @xmath212 , and @xmath213 is the time at which @xmath0 reaches @xmath214 .",
    "therefore , since the initial time variation of the field @xmath211 is small compared to @xmath215 , the field obtains a strong kick at @xmath216 to obtain the final state velocity of @xmath217 .",
    "another difference from more traditional inflationary scenarios is that the dark matter is initially out of thermal equilibrium after reheating ( or more accurately , entropy production ) in this scenario . to see this , first consider the more traditional inflationary paradigm .",
    "the neutralino @xmath134 self - annihilation rate behaves as@xmath218 where @xmath134 is relativistic , and @xmath219 is the weak coupling expansion parameter . on the other hand , the expansion rate after reheating in standard inflationary scenarios behaves as@xmath220 which means that the neutralinos are in equilibrium as long as @xmath221 in our scenario , however , @xmath3 is governed by @xmath16 ( not @xmath113 ) during kination domination , which is also when @xmath134 freezes out:@xmath222 in the above , we have used the fact that @xmath223 during kination domination .",

    "the fact that eq .",
    "( [ eq : temperaturebound ] ) exists for @xmath226 gev is important , since our goal is to embed the modified dark matter freeze - out scenario in which the dark matter was originally in equilibrium .",
    "one of the main advantages of embedding the kination domination scenario within an inflationary cosmological setting is that other predictions for observables can be made whose experimental confirmation would either support or rule out the scenario .",
    "we have already seen that if tensor perturbations are measured in the near future , this scenario is ruled out .",
    "there are many other observables correlated with this dark matter scenario .",
    "although an exhaustive analysis of these signatures is beyond the scope of this paper , we briefly discuss several possibilities here .    in the present scenario ,",
    "an out of equilibrium effective `` temperature '' scale as high as @xmath227 gev is reached at the end of inflation and the equilibration of the ( ms)sm particles occurs by temperatures of about @xmath228 gev . during the time until the temperature is below @xmath229 gev , the hubble expansion rate differs significantly from the usual radiation dominated universe value .",
    "this implies that any physics which depends both on the temperature and the hubble expansion will be modified .",
    "one testable example is the gravity wave production during the electroweak phase transition ( see for example @xcite ) , where the peak frequency of the gravity waves are set by the hubble scale . since @xmath3 is about @xmath230 of the usual hubble value ( for the same temperature )",
    ", the effects can be large even for a very small @xmath162 .",
    "exact details will require a careful reanalysis of the gravity wave production .",
    "the effects on electroweak baryogenesis are expected to be weaker since the out of equilibrium condition is primarily provided by the bubble wall velocity @xcite .",
    "a more careful investigation of this issue is left for future work .",
    "another prediction of this scenario is that since the temperature at which equilibrium is reached for any heavy lepton number carrying particle ( such as a right handed neutrino ) will be relatively low as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : temperaturebound ] ) , possible leptogenesis mechanisms in this context will necessarily be either nonthermal or nonstandard",
    ". it will be interesting to explore what kinds of leptogenesis scenarios are viable for this class of models .",
    "there are also predictions associated with particle astrophysics .",
    "for example , it is well known that explaining the heat measurement ( and other cosmic ray positron measurements ) of excess positrons around and above 7 gev requires an efficient annihilation of neutralinos ( or other thermal relics in the context of models of extra dimensions , etc . ) within our halo @xcite .",
    "one of the many problems associated with this efficient annihilation scenario is that the relic abundance of neutralinos is generically too low ( by a factor of 10 to 100 ) to explain most of the dark matter energy within the context of standard thermal scenarios .",
    "the kination scenario can clearly give the necessary boost to resurrect the neutralino dark matter annihilation explanation of the excess positrons .",
    "there are also other cosmic ray signatures which may shed light on nonstandard @xmath3 behavior @xcite .",
    "finally , there are other possible signatures such as the change in bbn due to the effects of residual annihilations after freeze - out @xcite , and the change in cosmic string generated gravity wave signature @xcite due to the change in @xmath231 involved in the scaling behavior of cosmic strings .",
    "since much of cosmology is about studying the out of equilibrium phenomena generated by the expansion of the universe within a finite temperature setting , further signatures related to a non - standard relationship between @xmath113 and @xmath3 will appear as we learn more about the early history of our universe .",
    "the possibility of a new scalar is generic in extensions of physics beyond the standard model of particle physics and cosmology ( particularly in those containing a dilatonic field degree of freedom ) .",
    "it is natural to expect that the dark energy density is connected with such a new scalar field degree of freedom .",
    "however , the elusive nature of dark energy , and its requisite small couplings to observable fields , make such conjectures difficult to verify or disprove .",
    "we have constructed a viable class of inflationary scenarios which exhibit a period of kination domination after inflation where the inflaton plays the role of the quintessence .",
    "such scenarios have the intriguing feature that they can lead to observable consequences for the dark matter freeze - out of thermal relics expected in many tev - scale extensions of the sm , which can be tested at the lhc and ilc .",
    "we have focused here on supersymmetric scenarios as prototype examples , for which the connections between astroparticle and collider physics have been extensively explored . however , other wimp candidates have recently emerged in models with flat @xcite or warped @xcite extra dimensions , in little higgs theories @xcite , or in technicolor models @xcite , to which the cosmological scenarios described in this paper could also be applied .",
    "the advantage of embedding kination - dominated quintessence models within an inflationary context is that it allows for many other correlated cosmological predictions which can corroborate or rule out such kination dominated scenarios .",
    "the most robust , nearly model independent , signature of this class of models is the absence of measurable tensor perturbations , such that any positive detection of tensor perturbations in upcoming experiments can rule out this scenario ( at least as far generating an observable shift in the dm abundance is concerned ) .",
    "other examples are measurements of gravity waves from the electroweak phase transition , shifts in the predictions for baryogenesis / leptogenesis , implications for the cosmic ray flux from dark matter annihilations , and other phenomena which depend on the ratio of the photon temperature to the hubble expansion rate @xmath231 .",
    "the class of models in this paper is meant to be illustrative and represent early attempts at model - building , and as such certain features are not optimal .",
    "for example , one might argue that the toy model presented here may not be easily achievable from an effective field theory point of view .",
    "however , it is reasonable to believe that this class of models are as potentially viable as any quintessence and most inflationary models that are considered seriously in the current literature . given that such scenarios may be testable through their potentially dramatic interconnection with dark matter predictions and tev - scale particle physics , they represent an intriguing and potentially fruitful ground for quintessence model - building which warrants further exploration .",

    "in this appendix , we consider the particle production computation for a real scalar degree of freedom coupled to gravity .",
    "we start with the perturbative expression for the bogoliubov coefficient as an integral over conformal time @xcite:@xmath232\\nonumber \\\\   & = & \\int\\frac{d(w_{k}^{2})}{4w_{k}^{2}}\\exp[-i\\int\\frac{d(w_{k}^{2})}{w_{k}'}],\\label{eq : phasefactor}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath233 which assumes that the effective mass is dominated by the ricci scalar @xmath234 ( note that @xmath235 corresponds to minimal gravitational coupling ) . using the approximation@xmath236 we find@xmath237 @xmath238,\\ ] ]",
    "in which @xmath239 is a unit stepfunction which evaluates to @xmath160 for @xmath240 . for the limits of the integral over @xmath241 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : phasefactor ] ) , we have@xmath242 during inflation , and@xmath243 after the end of inflation .",
    "the conformal time @xmath244 is not a single valued function of @xmath241 at the transition at the end of inflation .",
    "however , since the non - single valued time period is arbitrarily short ( in the limit that the potential behaves like a step function ) , this time period can be excised from the computation without loss of numerical accuracy , as long as a uv cutoff is imposed .",
    "the reason for the uv cutoff is that the peak strength of the nonadiabaticity responsible for particle production is precisely determined by the detailed gravitational dynamics of the transition time period , which we excise to simplify the computation .",
    "since the particle production is through gravitational curvature , there will generically be an exponential cutoff in momentum of the particles produced at @xmath155 , the expansion rate at the end of inflation . with this simplification , eq .",
    "( [ eq : phasefactor ] ) can be written as@xmath245+c_{1}(k^{2})\\right)\\right]\\nonumber \\\\   &   & + \\frac{1}{4}\\int_{x_{2}}^{k^{2}}\\frac{dx}{x}\\exp\\left[-i\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}}\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{6}+\\xi } \\left(\\frac{-2\\sqrt{x}}{\\sqrt{x - k^{2}}}+2\\ln\\left[\\sqrt{x - k^{2}}+\\sqrt{x}\\right]+c_{2}(k^{2})\\right)\\right],\\label{eq : betaclose}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which @xmath246 are constant phase factors which are independent of the integration variable @xmath247 and depend on @xmath248 , while @xmath249 which correspond to @xmath241 just before and after the end of inflation ( approximately a step function transition ) .    to obtain an estimate for @xmath250",
    ", we will neglect the interference term in @xmath250 , which means that we can neglect the integration constants @xmath251 .",
    "we will also utilize the fact that the contribution to the @xmath252 integral in eq.([eq : betaclose ] ) is appreciable only when @xmath247 is near @xmath253 and far away from @xmath254 because of the damping phase oscillations near @xmath255 . finally , we will only account for contributions with @xmath256 , so as to maintain the particle interpretation of the massless modes produced .",
    "we then find @xmath257\\right)^{2}+\\left(\\ln \\left [ 1+\\frac{2v_{0}}{m_{p}^{2}}\\left ( \\frac{1}{6}+\\xi \\right ) \\frac{a_{e}^{2}}{k^{2}}\\right ] \\right)^{2}\\right]\\theta(k - k_{min})\\theta(ah_{e}\\tilde{\\lambda}-k),\\ ] ] where @xmath258 is an appropriate infrared cutoff imposed to maintain the particle production interpretation of the massless modes , and @xmath259 is the uv cutoff , with @xmath260 reflecting the uncertainty in the uv cutoff function .",
    "taking the approximation that the log factors contribute @xmath261 , the energy density of the real scalar degree of freedom that is produced is@xmath262 taking the parameterization of the thermal equilibrium abundance of one real scalar degree of freedom as @xmath263 , where @xmath264 is the effective temperature and @xmath112 counts the number of degrees of freedom , we find@xmath265 for an order of magnitude estimate , we will absorb the uncertainty factor @xmath266 in the uncertainty in the effective number of degrees of freedom during the `` reheating '' stage at the end of inflation , and therefore write@xmath267 throughout the paper ."
