    "over 80% molecular gas in the milky way is found in giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) with masses @xmath13 and sizes between 2 and 100 pc .",
    "they have a column density of @xmath14 , independent of mass @xcite .",
    "observations of molecular gas across the local group have found that most of the molecular gas in these systems is also found in gmcs with properties similar to those in the disk of the milky way @xcite . beyond the local group ,",
    "observers find several galaxies where the typical molecular column density through the galactic disks is @xmath15 @xcite on kiloparsec scales implying that the ism is overwhelmingly molecular , since the column densities of atomic gas are only rarely seen to exceed @xmath16  @xmath17 .",
    "since this is larger than the typical column density through a single gmc in the local group , the molecular ism must be qualitatively different in these galaxies .",
    "do the molecular clouds in these galaxies blend together into a continuous sea of molecular gas or are there discrete clouds of molecular gas that are denser than local group gmcs ?",
    "moreover , what are the star forming structures in this molecular gas ? in the local group , star formation is predominantly found in gmcs , but if there are no discrete clouds in this molecular gas , do stars form uniformly throughout the galaxy from stellar mass clumps in the sea of gas ? if there are gmcs but they are smaller and denser than local group clouds , is the star formation efficiency enhanced ? in order to answer these questions , we have conducted a study of the molecule - rich galaxy m64 ( ngc 4826 ) at high resolution to search for gmc analogues in a molecule - rich environment .",
    "m64 is a good target for such a study because it has a mean column density across the central 2 kpc of the galaxy of @xmath18 , making it an intermediate case between the local group and starburst galaxies .",
    "the galaxy is one of the closest molecule rich galaxies ( 4.1  mpc , * ? ? ?",
    "a merger with a small , gas - rich galaxy roughly 1 gyr ago is thought to be responsible for the relatively large molecular gas content for its early hubble type ( sa ) ( * ? ? ?",
    "* b94 ) . the 3@xmath195 resolution obtained with the bima millimeter interferometer projects to 75 pc , which would be sufficient to resolve the largest molecular clouds in the milky way disk at the distance of m64 .",
    "two other recent studies examine properties of molecular emission in the nucleus of m64 .",
    "* m02 ) conducted a study of the nuclear region using the ovro millimeter array in the 3 mm transitions of @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and c@xmath20o .",
    "the primary beam at ovro has a fwhm of 65@xmath21 which samples gas to @xmath22 pc along the major axis and the map has a @xmath23 synthesized beam .",
    "these observations were principally used to determine the bulk properties of the molecular gas using lvg analyses .",
    "* hereafter nuga ) also conducted an extensive analysis of the molecular gas in the nuclear region using the iram plateau de bure interferometer ( pdbi ) in the @xmath2@xmath24 and the @xmath2@xmath25 transitions . with the 42@xmath21 primary beam ,",
    "the pdbi observations cover the galaxy to @xmath26 pc for the @xmath25 transition with a @xmath27 resolution .",
    "the nuga project focused interpretation of their data on the mechanisms by which the central agn could be fed .",
    "our search for molecular clouds in m64 is complementary to the aims of both m02 and nuga . with a 105@xmath21 primary beam and @xmath28 , our bima study maps the galaxy to the edge of the molecular disk at @xmath29  pc permitting a more thorough study of the molecular gas .",
    "in addition , this study includes zero - spacing observations of @xmath2  and @xmath3  which are essential in searching for low surface brightness gas among the clouds . in this paper",
    ", we report on our observations (  [ observations ] ) , examine the dynamics of the molecular disk (  [ rc ] ) and variations in the isotopic line ratios (  [ line_ratios ] ) , decompose the blended emission into cloud candidates and argue that these candidates represent the high density analogues of local group gmcs (  [ decomp ] ) .",
    "we observed m64 using the bima array @xcite in three tracers of molecular gas : @xmath2@xmath25 , @xmath3@xmath25 and hcn@xmath25 .",
    "we utilized data from the b , c and d arrays , including medium - resolution ( c array ) and zero - spacing ( uaso 12-m ) observations made in the bima survey of nearby galaxies ( song , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the combined observations resulted in a synthesized beam of @xmath28 which projects to a linear scale of 75 pc .",
    "details for the individual observations appear in table [ obsprops ] .",
    "we calibrated the visibility data using the same techniques as employed in song .",
    "the visibility data were inverted using natural weighting to maximize signal - to - noise ratios . the high resolution @xmath2",
    "observations had slightly different pointing centers with respect to the low resolution and zero - spacing data , requiring inversion to the image domain of the high and low resolution data separately .",
    "we then combined these co maps using the linear combination method @xcite .",
    "images were then cleaned using a hybrid hgbom / clark / sdi algorithm with the residuals of the cleaned components added back in to avoid any flux loss . to check for possible contamination by continuum emission from the agn , we imaged the lsb data from @xmath3  and hcn .",
    "the lack of sources in the resulting maps places a 3@xmath30 point source sensitivity of 3.4 mjy at 85 ghz for objects in the galaxy and a 3.2 mjy limit at 106 ghz .",

    "to provide a fully - sampled @xmath3  map , we observed the galaxy with the fcrao 14-m telescope .",
    "we observed 7 points arranged in a hexagonal pattern in order to obtain a nyquist - sampled map and recover all spatial frequencies .",
    "observations of sio maser stars through the night were used to check the pointing solution of the telescope .",
    "we observed the galaxy by alternately pointing at the galaxy with two different pixels in the sequoia 32-pixel receiver .",
    "we used the time that each pixel was pointed at blank sky as the reference position for that pixel .",
    "vane calibration was used to set the flux scale .",
    "we used two back ends in parallel : the quabbin extragalactic filterbank ( qef ) , which provided 320 mhz of spectral coverage in 64 5-mhz channels ( 864 km s@xmath36 divided into 13.5 km s@xmath36 channels ) , and the focal plane array autocorrelation spectrometer ( faas ) , which provided 80 mhz of spectral coverage with 0.3125 mhz channels ( 216 km s@xmath36 divided into 0.84 km s@xmath36 channels ) .",
    "unfortunately , the velocity range of 216 km s@xmath36 provided by the faas correlator is insufficient to cover the entire galaxy and the velocity resolution of the qef was too coarse to merge with the interferometer data .",
    "therefore , we had to observe the galaxy with two separate velocity configurations which measured the approaching and receding halves of the galaxy separately .",
    "we used the qef data to establish the common scaling between the two velocity configurations .",
    "since the faas and qef follow the same amplifier chain , smoothing faas data to the qef resolution should result in the same spectrum . to stitch together the two sets of faas data",
    ", we subtracted a linear baseline from the qef data and used the resulting spectrum as a model of signal emission in the faas data . by accounting for the expected signal using the qef data ,",
    "a linear baseline could be removed from each of the faas spectra separately and spectra from the two configurations could be merged .",
    "an example of this appears in figure [ fcrao_spec ] .",
    "typically , the spectra had a noise level of 12 mk in a 4.25 km s@xmath36 channel after correcting for a main beam efficiency of 0.5 at 110 ghz .",
    "as a check , we smoothed the final faas spectrum to the resolution of the qef data and found there were only small variations resulting from higher order baselines in the data sets .",
    "we merged the zero - spacing information with the @xmath3interferometer data using the linear combination technique @xcite .",
    "the merged dataset was deconvolved using a clean algorithm which terminated at the 1.5@xmath37 level of the data .",
    "the combined dataset contains @xmath38 of the single dish flux . finally , we regridded the @xmath2  and hcn images to match the spatial and velocity scale of the @xmath3  data to facilitate pixel - to - pixel comparison , resulting in a final channel width of 4.25 km s@xmath36 in all maps .",

    "the pa@xmath48 image was presented originally by @xcite .",
    "we followed the reduction steps presented in that work including removal of the ` pedestal effect ' in the nic3 camera .",
    "however , we adopted a different optimal scaling between the f160w continuum image ( @xmath51 ) and the f187n line image ( @xmath52 ) for continuum subtraction .",
    "we minimize a goodness - of - fit parameter @xmath53 with respect to the scaling @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the noise associated with each pixel and the power @xmath56 is determined by @xmath57 this construction preferentially fits those points in the narrow band image that are free from pa@xmath48 emission . for the nicmos data , @xmath58 .",
    "this method implicitly assumes that the color of the continuum does not vary across the map .",
    "the h@xmath48 images have not been published , and were observed under hst go proposal # 8591 ( richstone , d. ) .",
    "we used a similar procedure to that of the pa@xmath48 analysis to extract an image containing only h@xmath48 line flux from the archival data .",
    "the principal differences were that we used median filtering among an array of images to eliminate cosmic rays .",
    "we used a f547 m image of the galaxy for the continuum image and the f656n image containing the line flux .",
    "the optimal scaling between these two images is , on average , @xmath59 though data from each chip of the wfpc2 were treated separately .",
    "in figures [ comap ] to [ hcnmap ] , we present velocity - integrated maps of the molecular disk in m64 . the data have been masked to highlight the structure of the emission in the three maps .",
    "since all three data sets have the same coordinate axes , a single mask is generated common to all three data sets .",
    "an element is included in the mask if it has detectable emission in co. for the co data , the masking process begins by searching for all positions with emission ( @xmath60 ) greater than 4 times the rms value of the noise ( @xmath37 ) in _ two adjacent _ velocity channels .",
    "these regions are then expanded to include all pixels with @xmath61 that are connected in position or velocity space by @xmath62 detections to the joint @xmath63 detection `` core '' following the method used in @xcite . for comparison ,",
    "we have plotted an integrated intensity image using a 2@xmath37 clip in the right - hand panel of figure [ comap ] .",
    "the mask generated from the co is then applied to the @xmath3  and hcn emission . using a common mask among the different tracers",
    "facilitates direct comparison of the morphology of the molecular emission .",
    "we use this process since emission from rare tracers will be located in the regions of the datacube where there is emission from the more common tracers .",
    "because of this assumption , the masked maps have complex statistical properties since the co map contains only positive emission while the @xmath3  and hcn emission include noise in the data .",
    "nonetheless , the masking process highlights faint hcn emission in the disk of the galaxy which is difficult to detect by analyzing the hcn emission alone ( figure [ hcnmap ] ) .",
    "these faint features align with the strong co features seen in figures [ comap ] and [ cotopemap ] .",
    "we used monte carlo simulations to establish point source completeness limits with this masking algorithm for emission with a velocity fwhm of 2 channels .",
    "the quoted limits in table [ fluxtable ] are the threshold for a point source to be recovered in 90% of the monte carlo trials .",
    "we use this masking process to examine the structure of the emission and for the rotation curve but use simpler methods for line ratio studies and cloud decomposition .",
    "the three maps share several common features .",
    "the emission is strongly peaked at the center of the galaxy with a surrounding disk .",
    "the ne half of the disk shows stronger emission than the sw half .",
    "the molecular emission in the ne half of the galaxy aligns with the prominent dust lane that earns the galaxy s nickname of the ` evil eye ; ' however , these observations show that there is significant molecular gas in the sw of the galaxy as well .",
    "the disk appears to cut off sharply at a galactocentric radius of @xmath64 pc . to quantify this",
    ", we plot the azimuthally averaged surface brightness distributions in figure [ surfdens ] .",
    "the azimuthal average shows a significant cutoff at @xmath65 pc in the @xmath2  emission , well above the @xmath66 noise level of the observations .",
    "a similar cutoff is also seen in the @xmath3  emission and likely exists in the hcn emission but is below our significance threshold .",
    "m64 is peculiar because the outer disk ( @xmath67 kpc ) is counterrotating with respect to the inner and stellar disks .",
    "studies by @xcite and @xcite suggest that the outer disk is result of a retrograde merger with a small galaxy .",
    "they propose that interaction between the counterrotating gas disk and the prograde stellar+gas disk dissipates significant angular momentum , fueling infall to the central disk which accounts for the high values of the surface mass density of neutral gas @xcite .",
    "however , the gas in the central region of the galaxy ( @xmath68  kpc ) appears to be in a normal , rotating disk which is decoupled from the peculiar dynamics of the outer galaxy .",
    "the outer edge of the molecular disk occurs at the interface between the well - organized inner disk and the infalling ionized gas in the in region @xmath69 .",
    "since these are the first millimeter observations to cover the entirety of the molecular gas disk , we examined the dynamics of the inner region of the galaxy .",
    "we generated velocity fields from the masked emission for each of the three tracers .",
    "we analyzed the velocity fields using the tilted - ring algorithm first presented by @xcite to generate a rotation curve as implemented in the nemo stellar dynamics toolkit @xcite .",
    "we used literature values for initial estimates of the circular rotation speed , position angle , inclination , systemic velocity and dynamical center ( b94 , nuga ) .",
    "we then iteratively fit for these parameters until a convergent model was determined following the procedure described in @xcite .",
    "the derived parameters of the disk do not vary significantly for the molecular emission within @xmath70 of the galactic center , so we forced the inclination , position , systemic velocity , and position angle of the rings to be equal in order to improve the estimate of the dynamical properties .",
    "the dynamical center of the galaxy is at @xmath71 and @xmath72 with a systemic velocity of @xmath73 .",
    "the disk of the galaxy has a position angle of @xmath74 and an inclination @xmath75 averaged over @xmath76 using 4@xmath21 bins including corrections in the quoted errors for beam smearing and oversampling .",
    "these dynamical properties agree well with those adopted by other authors .",
    "the peak of the molecular emission is slightly offset ( @xmath77 ) from the dynamical center of the galaxy , as is found in many disk galaxies @xcite .",
    "the rotation curve of the galaxy is shown in figure [ rotcur ] for each of the three tracers and the ( from b94 ) .",
    "the rotation curves agree well for the three tracers in the inner portions of the galaxy . at large radii ,",
    "the rotation curve differs from that of the molecular gas .",
    "this may be a physical effect arising from infalling material interacting with the molecular disk .",
    "radial motions are seen in the atomic gas at larger radii ( @xmath78 , 1.6 kpc , b94 ) , so we fit the amplitude of an axisymmetric radial gas flow from the velocity field of the galaxy , which is plotted as @xmath79 in figure [ rotcur ] .",
    "we find that there are significant radial motions of molecular gas for @xmath80 ( 800  pc ) , with amplitudes comparable to the motions found at the inner edge of the counterrotating disk ( @xmath81 , b94 ) . in the region between @xmath82",
    ", we may be observing the interface between infalling gas and the rotating molecular disk .",
    "however , the molecular disk appears fairly asymmetric beyond @xmath83 ( 800  pc ) and radial motions may be the result of elliptical gas orbits .",
    "we also confirm the result of m02 who noted that that the @xmath2  emission at the ne end of the minor axis is significantly displaced in velocity from the circular rotation of the galaxy . finally , we see the same evidence for streaming motions in both @xmath2  and @xmath3  emission that is discussed in nuga in the inner parts of the molecular disk .",
    "the @xmath2  map ( figure [ comap ] ) appears to be significantly smoother than that of the @xmath3  map ( figure [ cotopemap ] ) .",
    "initially , it is unclear whether this reflects differences in the actual emission distribution or is due to noise because the dynamic range in the @xmath2map is twice as large as that in the @xmath3  map .",
    "however , as we discuss below , the difference in the morphologies is real and arises from variations in the fraction of molecular gas found in a diffuse , translucent phase as opposed to bound gas which is often `` opaque '' meaning @xmath84 . ] .",
    "because the abundance of @xmath3  is lower than that of @xmath2 typically by a factor of 40 to 70 @xcite , the optical depth of the @xmath3  line is significantly smaller than that of the @xmath2line . in a simple radiative transfer model through a slab of chemically uniform , isothermal gas",
    ", the line ratio @xmath85 should fluctuate between the abundance ratio of the two species in the optically thin limit to unity in the optically thick limit .",
    "averaged over a portion of the milky way disk , @xmath86 ( @xmath87 , * ? ? ?",
    "however , the value of @xmath88 varies depending on the structures observed .",
    "giant molecular clouds have @xmath89 @xcite while @xmath90 in translucent , high - latitude molecular clouds @xcite and @xmath91 is observed in small molecular structures in the ism @xcite . at the most fundamental level ,",
    "the variations in @xmath88 reflect variations in the relative opacities of the two line transitions .",
    "unfortunately , radiative transfer in molecular gas remains a daunting problem with solutions existing only for relatively simple problems .",
    "nonetheless , since bound , opaque clouds show a systematically lower value of @xmath88 than do diffuse , translucent clouds , we view variations in @xmath88 as empirical evidence for a changing fraction of material in bound clouds .",
    "in addition to having a higher value of @xmath88 , translucent molecular structures also exhibit a lower co - to - h@xmath10 conversion factor .",
    "we express the @xmath2-to - h@xmath10 conversion as @xmath92 where @xmath93 for massive clouds in the milky way @xcite and m33 @xcite . in translucent molecular clouds , @xmath94 @xcite ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath2  emission from translucent structures is _ overluminous _ relative to the molecular column in translucent clouds when compared to more massive structures .",
    "since these regions also exhibit high values of @xmath88 , the measurements of @xmath88 can , therefore , be used to highlight regions where the assumption of @xmath93 is questionable .",
    "variations in @xmath88 have been observed in extragalactic molecular clouds .",
    "@xcite used the owens valley interferometer to show that @xmath95 in a gmc in m33 ; but when the gmc and the surrounding gas was observed using a single dish telescope , they found @xmath96 .",
    "they attributed the difference between the @xmath88 values on different scales to the presence of diffuse molecular gas surrounding the gmc with @xmath97 . beyond the local group ,",
    "@xcite find significant variations in @xmath88 over the face of galaxies with increases in the centers of galaxies .",
    "@xcite find that starbursting or interacting galaxies have systematically higher values of @xmath88 . these regions",
    "likely contain a larger fraction of diffuse molecular gas than is seen in the milky way disk .",
    "we use the variation of @xmath88 across the face of m64 as proxy for whether the emission appears to rise predominantly from highly opaque objects ( @xmath98 ) or translucent objects ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "since the masking process likely introduces systematic effects into the generation of moment maps , we use the unmasked data . in order to increase the significance of a measurement",
    ", we averaged together several spectra from annuli in the plane of the galaxy .",
    "we used the rotation curve from  [ rc ] to shift each spectrum by the projected rotation velocity at each position which places the emission from each spectrum at a common velocity .",
    "the magnitude of the shift is @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the polar angle from the kinematic major axis , measured in the plane of the galaxy , and @xmath102 is the inclination .",
    "this correction does not account for radial motions in the galaxy which are significant at @xmath103  pc .",
    "this averaging process is so effective that it permits the measurement of hcn emission to large galactic radii , even though little emission can be clearly identified in the data cubes .",
    "examples of the averaging appear in figure [ speccomp ] for two annuli : @xmath104 pc and @xmath105 , which show substantially different line ratios , particularly in hcn .",
    "the spectrum for @xmath106 shows evidence for the hcn / co line ratio varying over the line with the wings of the line showing comparatively more hcn emission than the core of the line .",
    "the wings of the line are generated from region at @xmath107  pc where the velocity gradient across the synthesized beam is the largest .",
    "the larger line ratio in the wings suggests that the molecular gas is densest in the region near the agn ( c.f . ,",
    "nuga ) .",
    "we measured the line ratio as a function of position across the galaxy .",
    "we integrated the emission over the derived spectra to measure the flux in annuli of galactic radii 100 pc wide .",
    "we then took ratios of the fluxes and plot the results in figure [ linerat ] .    the value of @xmath88 changes significantly over the face of the galaxy with most of the molecular disk having a value of @xmath108 comparable to the disk of the milky way .",
    "the nuclear region ( @xmath109 pc ) and beyond @xmath110 pc show an increased value of @xmath88 .",
    "the material at small galactocentric radius may be affected by the presence of low - luminosity agn and a nuclear starburst @xcite which results in an increase in the kinetic temperature of the molecular gas .",
    "such an increase in the temperature is thought to produce an increased value of @xmath88 near the nuclei of many galaxies @xcite and is consistent with the enhanced @xmath2@xmath111/@xmath2@xmath112 ratio observed at @xmath113 pc in the nuga study . at large radii",
    ", the material may be disturbed by infalling material from the counter - rotating atomic disk beyond @xmath64 pc because the increase in @xmath88 is seen in gas where radial motions are observed (  [ rc ] ) .",
    "the change in @xmath88 is probably because the fraction of gas in a diffuse , translucent phase is higher in this region than in the remainder of the galaxy . in both of these regions ,",
    "the standard @xmath2-to - h@xmath114 conversion factor is suspect , since it is derived from gas where most of the molecular emission arises from cold , bound , opaque gmcs .    near @xmath107 , the ratio @xmath115 is comparable to that seen in the nucleus of the milky way @xcite on average , the value of @xmath115 over the entire galaxy is comparable to the value seen in the high column density regions of gmcs in the solar neighborhood or the inner disk of the milky way .",
    "the relatively high values of this line ratio imply that a substantially larger fraction of the molecular gas is found in high density regions than is typical for the solar neighborhood where @xmath116 @xcite .",
    "the integrated intensity images of the @xmath2  and @xmath3  emission look qualitatively different ; the @xmath3  emission looks significantly `` clumpier . '' since the @xmath3  emission should be a more faithful tracer of molecular column density than @xmath2  emission , the clumps seen in figure [ cotopemap ] suggest that there are clouds present in the data .",
    "however , the @xmath3  map also has lower dynamic range and the effects of masking may produce the difference in structure . in order to determine whether the @xmath3  map is actually clumpier , we measured the variation in line ratio as a function of spatial scale using fourier techniques .",
    "since bound clouds have a fixed spatial scale ( @xmath117 pc in the milky way ) , emission arising from them should have most of its power around this scale .",
    "in contrast , emission from diffuse clouds is not limited to a fixed scale and should contribute at all spatial scales . since the line ratio @xmath88 is different in diffuse vs. self - gravitating clouds , the ratio of power in the @xmath2  map to that of the @xmath3  map should vary as a function of spatial scale .",
    "we generated an integrated intensity map of the galaxy by shifting the emission in the spectra to a common velocity in order to eliminate the effects of galactic rotation .",
    "we integrated over a window 106.25 km s@xmath36 wide ( 25 channels ) centered on the emission line .",
    "this generated integrated intensity maps with improved signal - to - noise without introducing any erroneous spatial filtering from masking the data .",
    "the resulting maps contained @xmath118 of the emission found in the original maps with the missing emission in the nuclear region where the linewidth exceeds the width of the window .",
    "next , we fourier transformed the integrated intensity maps and averaged the power in elliptical annuli so that each annulus represents a range of scales in the _ deprojected _ image .",
    "we then subtracted the noise power from the data using the transform of noise images generated from emission - free regions of the data cube .",
    "the resulting power as a function of scale should represent only the power from line emission . in figure [ ftpow ]",
    "we plot the results of the analysis , scaling the @xmath3  image up by the ratio of the fluxes at small scales ( 4.1 ) to facilitate comparison .",
    "the power spectra have the same shape at large scales ( @xmath119 pc ) and small scales ( @xmath120 pc ) but they have different ratios of powers in these two regimes : @xmath121 for @xmath119 pc and @xmath122 for @xmath123 pc .",
    "the value of @xmath88 at small scales is comparable to that seen in galactic gmcs , and emission on these scales is from structures that may be the analogues of galactic gmcs .",
    "compared to the @xmath2  map , the @xmath3  map has less emission at large scales where only diffuse gas should contribute .",
    "hence , @xmath3  emission from clouds will be less confused by the presence of diffuse gas compared to @xmath2  emission .",
    "the flux ratios derived in this analysis do not agree with the ratios calculated for the galaxy as a whole ( figure [ linerat ] ) for two reasons : ( 1 ) much of the emission with a large value of @xmath88 is located in the center of the galaxy where the velocity range is smaller than the linewidth so some high-@xmath88 emission is not included ; and ( 2 ) incomplete subtraction of the noise power will skew the ratios to lower values .",
    "this is because the noise power , relative to the signal , is larger in the @xmath3  emission .",
    "if there is incomplete subtraction of the noise , it will contribute more to the power in the @xmath3  emission than to the @xmath2  emission .",
    "the observed difference in flux ratios as a function of scale persists even when the dynamic range of the @xmath2  image is reduced to match that of the @xmath3  image .",
    "we conclude that the different morphologies in figures [ comap ] and [ cotopemap ] represent a real difference in the structure of the emission from the galaxy and are not the result of the masking process .",
    "furthermore , it appears that there is significant contribution to the molecular emission from a diffuse , translucent component of the molecular ism . by analogy with molecular emission in the milky way ,",
    "it is likely that it has a conversion factor @xmath124 . despite the lower signal - to - noise",
    ", the @xmath3  map should be a better tracer of the molecular emission from bound clouds in m64 .",
    "we return to the question of diffuse gas in ",

    "to answer the fundamental question of this study , namely ` are there gmcs in m64 ? ' , we decompose the blended molecular emission into clouds and then compare the properties of these clouds with local group gmcs . for this purpose , we focus on the @xmath3  emission since this tracer will be less contaminated by emission from diffuse molecular gas .",
    "there are three principal methods for isolating structures in blended molecular emission ( 1 ) partitioning of the cube by eye ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , ( 2 ) `` cleaning '' the data set by iteratively fitting and subtracting three dimensional gaussians pioneered with the gaussclumps algorithm by @xcite ( 3 ) partitioning of the emission by assigning it to the `` closest '' local maximum first developed in the clumpfind algorithm by @xcite .",
    "we adopt the latter approach for m64 since it does not require known functional forms for the @xmath3  distribution of the clouds and it works directly with the emission present in the datacube .",
    "the original clumpfind algorithm was implemented for the high signal - to - noise regime on single dish data .",
    "we have redeveloped the algorithm using the methods of @xcite to make the method more robust in the presence of noise .",

    "masked data used in figure 3 was hampered by including low significance emission and noise . to improve the sensitivity of the datasets , we smoothed all three datacubes to a channel width of 8.5 km  s@xmath36 .",

    ", we scale their relationship down by a factor of @xmath86 , the global @xmath2/@xmath3  line ratio , in the inner disk of the milky way @xcite . in figure [ larson ] , we plot the relationships between these macroscopic properties for the clouds in m64 .",
    "we have excluded clouds with linewidths larger than @xmath133 .",
    "these clouds contain multiple peaks and appear to be the blend of two smaller clouds .",
    "these clouds are found near the center of the galaxy where the large velocity gradient makes decomposition of the emission difficult .",
    "several features are immediately apparent from figure [ larson ] .",
    "first , the properties of the clouds are significantly different from the relationships derived by s87 .",
    "second , the clouds have large luminosities compared to the local group clouds . in s87 , very few clouds are massive enough to have a @xmath3  luminosity larger than @xmath134 . for reference ,",
    "the mass implied by the @xmath2  luminosity has also been plotted in figure [ larson ] assuming @xmath86 and @xmath135 , which gives a @xmath3-to - h@xmath10 conversion factor equivalent to that derived using dust extinction by @xcite . to compare the milky way and m64 clouds in a more quantitative fashion",
    ", we fit linear trends between @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 for the @xmath3  clouds using the method of @xcite , which is appropriate for a population with intrinsic scatter and measurements with errors in both parameters .",
    "we find that @xmath139 the index for the linewidth ",
    "size is marginally different from the value for the local group ( @xmath140 vs.  0.5 ) , and the luminosity - linewidth is significantly different from the local group trend ( @xmath141 vs.  5.0 ) .",
    "these fits indicate that the clouds identified in the m64 data are not like molecular clouds seen in the disk of the milky way .",
    "however , the luminosity of these clouds implies that most of the clouds are significantly more massive than any clouds analyzed in the s87 study , and indeed @xcite argue that no clouds more massive than @xmath142 will be found in the milky way disk .",
    "thus , we are comparing the properties of these clouds with an _ extrapolation _ of local group clouds to high mass .",
    "it is noteworthy , however , that the low luminosity clouds in m64 have comparable luminosities , sizes and linewidths to the most massive clouds in the milky way .",
    "thus , the m64 clouds may indicate a change in the scalings among gmc properties that occurs at high mass ( or high average surface density ) .",
    "we can not determine whether the apparent differences with respect to the s87 trends are an environmental effect or are intrinsic to high mass molecular clouds .",
    "while the analysis has focused on the @xmath3  clouds , figure [ larson ] shows that the clouds generated for other tracers have similar behaviors .",
    "scaling the luminosity of the co clouds down by 6.7 to place them on a similar scale as the @xmath3  clouds produces a luminosity  linewidth relationship statistically indistinguishable from the relationship for the @xmath3  clouds .",
    "in contrast , the sizes of the @xmath2  clouds appear significantly larger than the @xmath3clouds .",
    "a two - sided ks test indicates that the distributions of the @xmath2  and @xmath3  cloud radii are significantly different ( @xmath143 ) , while the distributions of the linewidths are indistinguishable .",
    "we suspect that the larger @xmath2  radius results from the algorithm including the diffuse @xmath2  emission that surrounds the clouds in the definition of the @xmath2  clouds . to confirm this ,",
    "we re - cataloged the @xmath2  emission clipping the map at @xmath144 , producing roughly the same dynamic range as the @xmath3  map .",
    "the high clipping level eliminates the low surface brightness , diffuse @xmath2  emission .",
    "our inclusion of a gaussian extrapolation to a common clipping level facilitates direct comparison between the resulting catalogs .",
    "the clipped catalog contained 33 clouds ; these clouds have sizes comparable to the @xmath3  clouds , and a two - sided ks test found the distributions of both the sizes and the linewidths to be indistinguishable between the two tracers .",
    "the presence of diffuse emission can thus significantly affect the sizes of clouds traced by @xmath2  emission alone .",
    "a major concern with the decomposition is whether the structures that the algorithm isolates really do represent discrete physical entities or whether the `` clouds '' are really blends of several small clouds that can not be decomposed with the resolution of these observations .",
    "we suggest that this is not the case and that we are cataloging physical objects for several reasons .",
    "first , we tested the hypothesis that the clouds are blends of several gmcs like those found in the milky way by analyzing simulated data sets . for each data",
    "set , we constructed a population of 50 molecular clouds with a total mass of @xmath145 and individual masses drawn randomly from a mass distribution with @xmath146 . for each cloud in the simulation , we calculated the radius and linewidth that would be expected based on the study of s87 .",
    "we randomly distributed these clouds in a data cube so that they would appear as a cloud with @xmath147150 pc and @xmath148  km  s@xmath36 , which is appropriate for a typical massive cloud in our data set ( figure [ larson ] ) .",
    "we then convolved the simulated cube to the resolution of the observations and added noise to produce a peak signal - to - noise ratio of 8 .",
    "we processed each simulated cube with the same masking and decomposition algorithm used in the data analysis .",
    "the algorithm identifies substructure within the data cubes in 90% of the trials , leading us to conclude that the clouds are not likely to be blends of a gmc population like that seen in the disk of the milky way .",
    "the second piece of evidence that the decomposition products represent real objects is that the linewidths of the observed clouds , while large , are still significantly smaller than would be expected if the emission were composed of several smaller clouds orbiting in the galactic potential .",
    "we estimate the linewidth due to shear as @xmath149 where @xmath150 is the integrated intensity at each position in the cloud , @xmath151 is difference between the mean velocity and the line - of - sight projection of the rotation velocity at each position in the cloud , and @xmath152 is the linewidth of the emission distribution at the cloud center . the final term accounts for broadening due to beam - smearing and the intrinsic gas velocity dispersion .",
    "the measured linewidth for the clouds ( @xmath128 in table [ cloudlist ] ) is smaller than @xmath153 by a factor of 2.3 on average and does not change significantly with radius , even in the outer galaxy where the shear decreases .",
    "estimates of the cloud masses using the virial theorem agree well with estimates using the @xmath3  emission , giving a third piece of evidence that we are identifying clouds .",
    "in particular , if we adopt the virial mass estimate used by s87 , @xmath154 we find good correspondence between the virial mass estimates and luminous mass estimates as indicated in figure [ vtplot ] .",
    "a linear fit between the log of the two mass estimates gives @xmath155 consistent with a direct correspondence between the mass estimates over an order of magnitude .",
    "this good agreement again suggests that the clouds are discrete objects , since the application of the virial theorem to unbound groups of molecular clouds gives virial masses significantly in excess of the mass estimated from the co luminosity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we have also used four alternate methods to measure the virial parameters @xcite and find no significant differences between the various methods .",
    "if the clouds represent self - gravitating objects , we can use the relationship between the luminous mass estimates and dynamical mass estimates to derive conversion factors for the tracers . assuming the clouds are virialized , we perform a least - squares fit between @xmath156 and @xmath157 , fixing the slope at unity to determine the scaling between these two tracers . using these fits",
    ", we derive co - to - h@xmath10 conversion factors : @xmath158 @xmath159 where the surface brightness @xmath160 is expressed in k  km  s@xmath36 .",
    "if we assume the clouds are marginally bound instead of being virialized , we derive conversion factors that are a 2 times lower than these values . given that the derived conversion factors bracket the measured values for both @xmath2  @xcite and @xmath3  @xcite , it appears that dynamical estimates of the mass agree well with masses estimated from co luminosity .",
    "significant external pressure or the presence of magnetic fields will reduce the value of @xmath161 , closing the small gap between the luminous ( @xmath93 , @xmath86 ) and virial mass estimates @xcite . in light of this , we adopt @xmath93 for the @xmath2  observations and the conversion factor of @xcite for the @xmath3 . under the assumption of virialization",
    ", we also derive @xmath162 implying hcn is brighter relative to co in these clouds than is seen in solar neighborhood gmcs @xcite .",
    "however , hcn / co ratio is similar to gas in the nuclear disk of the milky way where the mean density is higher .    with mass measurements of the molecular clouds",
    ", we can convert these estimates to surface densities of the clouds .",
    "we plot the surface density of molecular gas in the clouds as a function of cloud mass in figure [ sdplot ] . on average , the surface densities of the clouds are larger than are seen in the milky way with a mean value of @xmath163 , significantly higher than the value of @xmath164 seen in the milky way @xcite and m33 @xcite .",
    "in addition , the surface density is _ not _ constant with mass , which must be true if the clouds in the galaxies are self - gravitating but do not follow the same linewidth ",
    "size relationship as is observed in the local group .",
    "we find that @xmath165 meaning that high mass molecular clouds are systematically smaller and denser than would be expected from the extrapolation of trends seen in the local group .",
    "moreover , an increased surface density of molecular gas also implies that the internal pressures of the molecular clouds are larger than are typical in the local group .",
    "we estimate the internal pressures of these clouds : @xmath166 we find a mean internal pressure of @xmath167  k  @xmath168 , an order of magnitude larger than the value inferred for milky way gmcs @xcite . however , an important quantity for comparison with the internal pressure is the mean external pressure exerted on the cloud by the ism of m64 .",
    "@xcite formulated an expression for the midplane hydrostatic pressure of the disks of galaxies : @xmath169 where @xmath170 is the 1-dimensional velocity dispersion of the gas , @xmath171 is the stellar scale height , and @xmath172 is the stellar surface density .",
    "we assume a gas velocity dispersion of @xmath173 km s@xmath36 , corresponding to the linewidth of forbidden line emission in @xcite .",
    "we derive an upper limit for the pressure by assuming and @xmath171 of 300 pc , typical of disk galaxies @xcite .",
    "we measure @xmath172 derived from the 2mass large galaxy atlas image of m64 @xcite assuming @xmath174 @xcite .",
    "finally , we take @xmath175 . we calculate @xmath176 from the @xmath3  surface density profile and use @xmath177 as measured in @xcite . with these data ,",
    "we compare the internal pressures of molecular clouds to the external pressure at the position of the cloud and find that the clouds are overpressured relative to the external medium by _ at least _ a factor of 2 .",
    "if we refine this estimate , the difference between @xmath178 and @xmath179 grows larger .",
    "of particular note , this estimate has included the contribution of the gas in self - gravitating molecular clouds in the contribution to the external pressure .",
    "these clouds likely do not contribute to the hydrostatic support of the ism .",
    "since this gas dominates the local column density , the actual external pressure is likely significantly smaller than the above estimate .",
    "if we use the estimate that 25% of the molecular gas is found in the diffuse component (  [ diffuse ] ) and assume that self - gravitating clouds do not contribute to the hydrostatic support of the ism , then the clouds have internal pressures higher than the local ism by a factor of 12 , similar to the margin by which solar neighborhood gmcs are overpressured with respect to the local ism @xcite .",
    "recent star formation activity will decrease the mass - to - light ratio and therefore the mass estimate of the stellar disk , also reducing the external pressure .",
    "the central concentration of mass in gmcs tends to increase the internal pressures .",
    "finally , the stellar scale height is likely larger than the 300 pc typical of galactic disks because of the presence of a significant bulge in the galaxy across the inner @xmath180 pc @xcite .",
    "because the clouds are significantly overpressured with respect to the ambient medium , we take this as a final piece of evidence that the clouds are self - gravitating and that the luminosity traces molecular mass with conversion factors comparable to milky way values . adding this to the agreement between the luminous and dynamical mass estimates and the small linewidths of the clouds , there is good evidence that molecular clouds identified by this method are gravitationally bound .",
    "the masses of many clouds are significantly larger than are seen in the disk of the milky way , where galactic tides set an upper limit to the mass of a gmc @xcite .",
    "there is significant shear in the inner disk of m64 which may disrupt the clouds so we measured the tidal acceleration across each of the gmcs .",
    "we find that the clouds in table [ cloudlist ] are marginally stable against tides using the methods of @xcite .",
    "all clouds at @xmath181  pc are very stable against tidal disruption .",
    "we conclude that these clouds are the analogues of the gmcs seen in the milky way , but have significantly different macroscopic properties .",
    "several assumptions and choices have been incorporated in the conclusion that the molecular clouds observed in m64 are self - gravitating structures , analogous to high mass giant molecular clouds .",
    "however , the principal results of our study do not change even if we relax these assumptions .",
    "the largest influence on our cloud properties is the choice of the decomposition algorithm .",
    "the algorithm we developed has been designed to be robust against small variations in its parameters .",
    "although we justify the choice of free parameters in appendix [ algorithm ] , we have re - cataloged the @xmath3  emission while varying contouring levels and values of @xmath182 ( the free parameters of the algorithm ) .",
    "we found all changes in the cloud properties were small and well within the uncertainties .",
    "because the clouds are comparable to the beam size , there is significant concern that the objects we catalog are the blends of several smaller clouds .",
    "we have argued in  [ gmcs ] that this is not the case , based on simulations , pressure arguments , dynamical mass estimates and cloud linewidths .",
    "several of our results rely upon accurate decomposition of the emission .",
    "however , the most important of our results remain even if the clouds are blends of smaller structures .",
    "namely , the surface ( and volume ) densities of the small clouds must be even higher than measured for the m64 clouds , implying they are even more over - pressured with respect to the ambient ism ; the estimate of the internal pressure ( equation [ press_eq ] ) becomes a lower limit .",
    "moreover , much of the following discussion (  [ disc ] ) is independent of how the clouds are decomposed .",
    "we also emphasize that the molecular structures can not consist of milky way gmcs overlapping along the line of sight since milky way gmcs clouds are not dense enough to exist as discrete structures in the high - pressure molecular disk of m64 .",
    "the derived properties have been corrected for the finite signal - to - noise ratio in the dataset using a gaussian extrapolation ( see appendix [ cloudmeth ] ) .",
    "we have tested the validity of the gaussian correction to the cloud properties by fitting three - dimensional gaussians to the results of the decomposition .",
    "we find that the extrapolated values agree well with the fits .",
    "if we repeat the analyses of  [ gmcs ] without the corrections to their properties , we find ( 1 ) the indices of the linewidth  size and luminosity  linewidth relationships are still significantly different from the local group values , ( 2 ) the luminous and virial mass estimates still agree well , ( 3 ) the mean surface density of the clouds is @xmath183 , even higher than our adopted value and ( 4 ) the clouds are still significantly overpressured with respect to the ism of m64 .    finally , the distance to m64 is somewhat uncertain with a recent estimate of @xmath184 mpc @xcite .",
    "adopting a larger distance will change the values of the luminosity ( as @xmath185 ) and the sizes ( as @xmath186 ) but leave the linewidths unaffected .",
    "the indices of the scalings between the macroscopic properties will be invariant and remain different from the local group .",
    "the clouds will appear to have higher luminous masses relative to their virial masses ( @xmath187 ) and will still appear bound , though the derived conversion factors will be smaller .",
    "the surface densities of the molecular clouds do not vary with the adopted distance and will be significantly higher than local group values .",
    "while changing the adopted distance will alter the measured cloud properties , the main conclusions are robust : the most massive clouds in m64 appear to be self - gravitating structures with macroscopic properties significantly different from an extrapolation from local group gmcs .",
    "in this section , we relate the results of this study to molecular gas on galactic scales .",
    "we estimate the contribution of diffuse molecular gas to emission from m64 and examine the dust content and star - forming properties of the molecular clouds .",
    "clarifying the properties of these high mass molecular clouds helps to link our understanding of star formation on small scales in the milky way to starbursts and ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) .",
    "given the large @xmath2  to @xmath3  line ratio ( @xmath88 ) observed in some portions of m64 , we suspect that a significant contribution of the emission arises from diffuse , translucent molecular gas .",
    "the resolved gmcs in table [ cloudlist ] comprise @xmath18850% of the @xmath3  emission from the galaxy .",
    "we can not distinguish how much of the remaining emission arises from gmcs below our completeness limit or whether the emission arises from diffuse molecular gas .",
    "since emission from diffuse gas has a substantially different value of @xmath88 from that found in the gmcs , we can use our observations to establish the ratio of @xmath2  emission coming from diffuse gas vs. bound objects ( @xmath189 ) : @xmath190 where @xmath191 is the line ratio in diffuse gas , @xmath192 is the line ratio in gmcs and @xmath193 is the average of the line ratio over a given region @xcite . within the 25 clouds identified in the @xmath3  emission , the line ratio @xmath194 , which is typical of the peaks of emission from gmcs in our own galaxy @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the physical conditions averaged over these gmcs are comparable to the highest column density regions of gmcs in our own galaxy .",

    "a significant fraction ( 20% ) of the @xmath2  emission comes from the inner 200 pc of the galaxy , around the agn . here ,",
    "@xmath199 which implies that between 65% and 85% of the @xmath2  emission from the nucleus arises from diffuse molecular material which is equal to the fraction over the entire galaxy .",
    "in contrast , between 25% and 60% of the @xmath3  emission comes from diffuse gas . assuming the @xmath3  emission linearly traces the molecular mass of the galaxy , we assume @xmath200 and estimate that 25% of the molecular mass resides in diffuse structures and the remainder is in bound clouds .",
    "the results of the fourier analysis of the emission suggest a similar trend . in the @xmath3  emission ,",
    "the power on small ( @xmath201  pc ) scales comprises 20% of the total power , but for @xmath2 , this decreases to 10% .",
    "the fourier analysis does not completely separate diffuse from bound emission since the diffuse component of the molecular ism contributes power on small scales as well .",
    "line ratios indicate that a substantial portion of the molecular emission arises from diffuse gas , where the standard co - to - h@xmath10 conversion may be suspect .",
    "the @xmath3-to - h@xmath10 conversion factor is more appropriate for estimating the mass of the galaxy .",

    "the two mass estimates for the molecular gas agree within the errors in the flux measurements , and the mass measurement of the gas appears robust . using @xmath3  emission to measure molecular mass will likely provide a more robust measurement of molecular mass in star - forming molecular clouds rather than the diffuse gas which is presumably inert with respect to star - formation .      both co isotopomers confirm a large mass of molecular gas in the inner kiloparsec of m64 ; and with the implied large column density of molecular material , there should be accompanying dust . @xcite use iso and scuba data to measure the long wavelength ( @xmath204 ) infrared and submillimeter emission from m64 and find an emission distribution consistent with two dust components at @xmath205  k and 28  k respectively",

    "are determined by contouring the data in units of @xmath280 , descending through the contour levels , and marking any new , isolated island at a given contour level as a new maximum . however",
    ", a noise fluctuation can cause an artificial local maximum and a false clump and the choice @xmath281 is a compromise between discriminating against noise spikes ( large contouring interval ) and sensitivity to emission structure ( small contour level ) . to optimize the algorithm",
    ", we separate these two criteria : adopting a small contouring level to follow the emission structure well while keeping track of the levels at which isolated regions merge in order to later determine whether certain `` clouds '' represent noise spikes .",
    "we adopt a similar method to ( and heavily inspired by ) the work of @xcite . in their method , two local maximum",
    "are considered distinct if the saddle point connecting them is at least @xmath282 below both maxima .",
    "@xcite use @xmath283 but we find a value of 3.0 is appropriate for our data ( see figure [ tuniq ] ) . in our method , we contour the data in units of @xmath284 , and record isolated islands that appear in each contour level as well as the level at which pairs of maxima merge .",
    "if a maximum merges with another , higher maximum and the saddle point between the maxima is less than @xmath285 , it is considered to be the same cloud and the smaller local maximum is removed from the analysis .",
    "this selects against noise spikes since they appear as isolated maxima in a single resolution element of the datacube whereas cloud structures appear in multiple elements .",
    "once all connected local maxima are tested for the presence of noise , the remaining local maxima are used to partition the data set .",
    "the data set is partitioned by stepping downward from the maximum value of @xmath286 in units of @xmath284 .",
    "pixels added at each level are assigned to the local maximum that has the shortest path through the datacube connecting the pixel to that maximum .",
    "paths are constrained to run through pixels which contain emission , and the length of a path between two pixels is defined as the minimum length over all possible paths that lie within the bounds of the emission .",
    "steps in velocity are considered to be a factor of @xmath287 longer than steps in position space .",
    "if pixel is connected to two maxima by paths of equal length , then the pixel is assigned to the closest pixel using a euclidean distance metric : @xmath288 here , @xmath279 is the same factor that accounts for oversampling in the spatial direction .",
    "if the pixels have equivalent path and euclidean distances to two separate maxima , the pixel is assigned randomly to one .",
    "to evaluate the optimal parameters in running the algorithm , we performed monte carlo simulations on controlled simulations .",
    "the simulated data consisted of two clouds with gaussian profiles in position and velocity space .",
    "interferometer noise was added to some trials to mimic the observation conditions . ideally , the algorithm will consistently separate the blended gaussians into ( only ) two clouds . by varying the signal - to - noise , gaussian separation and algorithm parameters",
    ", we explored the limitations of the algorithm and the ideal parameters for decompositions . in figure [ tuniq ] , we display the results of two such experiments .",
    "first , we fixed the cloud separation at @xmath289 and varied the peak signal - to - noise to determine the limitations imposed by noise on the decomposition . for @xmath290",
    ", we find that our modified clumpfind algorithm consistently recovers two clouds while the original clumpfind finds a significantly larger number owing to the presence of noise .",
    "the modified algorithm breaks down when the signal - to - noise ratio is less than 5 . in the second panel of figure [ tuniq ]",
    ", we compare the number of clouds resulting from the decomposition as a function of cloud separation and @xmath291 .",
    "this experiment explores the ability of the algorithm to separate blended clouds and motivates our selection of @xmath290 .",
    "we choose a signal - to - noise ratio of 8 for the trials . selecting @xmath292 results in noise spikes causing a spurious decomposition of the clouds .",
    "selecting @xmath293 does not significantly change the results of the decomposition .",
    "the algorithm successfully separates clouds with a separation between them of @xmath294 .",
    "we have also checked the influence on choice of contour levels and find that a contouring the data in levels smaller 0.5 @xmath37 does not change the outcome of the decomposition .",
    "we use 0.5@xmath37 in our analysis of the data .",
    "in addition , we also check the ratio of fluxes in the resulting clouds for trial clouds with unequal intensities ; and we find that the algorithm partitions the clouds reasonably .",

    "the position of the cloud is taken as the centroid position , weighted by the antenna temperature in each pixel @xmath295 , e.g. , @xmath296 .",
    "the linewidth and radius of the cloud are calculated by taking the second moment of the emission in velocity and position respectively : @xmath297\\\\ \\sigma_v^2 & = & \\frac{1}{\\sum_i t_i}\\sum_i t_i \\left(v - v_0\\right)^2\\label{sigv}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to transform the moments into cloud radii and linewidths , we first corrected the derived moments for the effects of clipping , since the lowest contour level is at @xmath298 rather than zero .",
    "as such , the derived moments underestimate the true @xmath299 and @xmath300 of the cloud . in order to compensate , we assumed the clouds have a gaussian profile in position - position - velocity space .",
    "since the clouds are only marginally resolved at best , the assumption of a gaussian profile seems to be reasonable .",
    "we correct the moments by the ratio of the value of the moment extrapolated to a common reference value to the value of the moment for emission clipped at @xmath298 @xcite .",
    "the correction factor depends solely upon the peak - to - edge ratio , @xmath301 where @xmath302 is the maximum antenna temperature in the emission region and @xmath303 is the clipping level , equal to @xmath304 for this study . in this case , the correction factor , @xmath305 , is @xmath306\\cdot \\left[\\frac{\\int_0^{x_{max}}x^4 \\exp(-x^2/2 ) } { \\int_0^{x_{max}}x^2 \\exp(-x^2/2 ) } \\right]^{-1}\\mbox { where } \\\\",

    "the linewidth is calculated by scaling the corrected dispersion to a fwhm using the gaussian linewidth correction : @xmath312 .",
    "the cloud radius is derived by correcting @xmath313 for clipping and beam convolution and then applying the scaling from @xmath313 used by @xcite in their study of milky way clouds : @xmath314 our simple model to correct @xmath130 for beam convolution breaks down when @xmath315 , and so we only consider a cloud resolved if @xmath316 .",
    "similarly , we only consider a cloud to be resolved in the velocity direction if @xmath128 is larger than the channel width .",
