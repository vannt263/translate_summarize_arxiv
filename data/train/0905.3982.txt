    "to understand the formation and evolution of galaxies strongly relies on investigations of when and where stars formed in the history of the universe from high redshift to the present day . since the pioneering study by madau et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , a number of observational studies have investigated how the star formation rate density ( sfrd ) varies as a function of redshift .",
    "such studies brought us a global evolutionary picture of the sfrd ; the sfrd steeply increases in the first 900 myrs , peaks at @xmath5 , and then decreases rapidly toward the present day ( e.g. , madau et al.1996 ; lilly et al . 1996 ; fujita et al .",
    "2003 ; bouwens & illingworth 2006 )",
    ". however , we are still far from a complete understanding of the galaxy evolution since the redshift evolution of the sfrd gives us only the `` averaged '' picture of the star formation history in the universe .",
    "there exists a wide variety of environments in the universe , such as field , groups , and clusters of galaxies .",
    "moreover , even within the field , there are structures like high- and low - density regions .",
    "it is thus essential to study the star formation in galaxies as a function of both the redshift and the environment .",
    "one possible approach is to study the relation between the galaxy properties and the environments at various epochs .",
    "the environmental effects on galaxy properties in the local universe have been extensively studied in the past .",
    "star formation activity in galaxies is known to decline with increasing density ( e.g. , lewis et al .",
    "2002 ; gomez et al.2003 ) , and the fraction of star - formation galaxies decreases with increasing density ( e.g. , carter et al . 2001 ; balogh et al . 2004 ; mateus & sodr 2004 ) .",
    "these findings agrees quite well with the so - called `` morphology - density relation '' , i.e. , the fraction of early - type galaxies increases with increasing density , while the fraction of late - type galaxies decreases with increasing density ( e.g. , dressler 1980 ; dressler et al . 1997 ; goto et al .",
    "2003 ; capak et al .",
    "all these results suggests that the star formation in high - density region are more active than in the low - density regions .",
    "in contrast , recent observational studies in the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ; dickinson & giavalisco 2002 ) and the deep2 galaxy redshift survey ( deep2 ; davis et al .",
    "2003 ) shows that this relation becomes completely opposite at @xmath6 ; the star - formation activity depends positively on the density of galaxies ( elbaz et al .",
    "2007 ; cooper et al . 2008 ) .",
    "the origin of this drastic change between @xmath6 and @xmath3 in still not clear .    in this paper",
    ", we present the relationship between the star - formation activity and the environment at @xmath7 , in the cosmic evolution survey ( cosmos ; scoville et al .",
    "2007a ) field .",
    "we estimate star - formation activity by focusing on the `` emitter fraction '' .",
    "specifically we investigate the fraction of galaxies emitting [ o ii ]   @xmath83727 emission ( hereafter `` [ o ii ]  emitters '' ) , as a function of the galaxy local density .",
    "the [ o ii ]  @xmath9 ( hereafter [ o ii ]  ) emission line is a good estimator of the star - formation activity in galaxies at intermediate redshift ( e.g. , jansen et al . 2001 ) .",
    "although it is known that the [ o ii ]  emission line is affected by dust extinction and metallicity , such effects on the emitter fraction are thought to be small , since our [ oii ] emitters are selected based on the equivalent widths ( ews ) .",
    "specifically , the [ o ii ]  ew is significantly smaller in very metal - poor and metal - rich galaxies , with respect to galaxies with the solar metallicity .",
    "however , it is observed that the variation is relatively small , only a factor of 2 - 3 , in the metallicity range of @xmath10 ( e.g. , nagao et al .",
    "since galaxies with metallicity out of this range are expected to be rare , we consider that the metallicity effect on the emitter fraction is not significant .",
    "we have already carried out the subaru imaging observations of the cosmos field ( taniguchi et al .",
    "the sample of [ o ii ]  emitters in the cosmos field was obtained by takahashi et al .",

    "thanks to the very large survey area ( 2 square degrees ) of the cosmos field , we are able to obtain a typical picture of the star - formation activity in galaxies , avoiding the cosmic variance .",
    "the cosmos field includes various regions within a wide of density ( e.g. , scoville et al .",
    "2007a , 2007b ; takahashi et al .",
    "2007 ) , so that we are able to investigate systematically the environmental effects on the star formation activity in galaxies .    in  2",
    ", we describe the sample selection and discuss the possible contamination in the photometric - redshift sample .",
    "the results of the star - formation activity - environment relation at @xmath0 and the dependence of the morphology on the density are presented in  3 .",

    "finally we give a brief summary in  5 . throughout this paper ,",
    "magnitudes are given in the ab system .",
    "we adopt a flat universe with the following cosmological parameters ; @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "in order to derive the emitter fraction and investigate its environmental dependence , we require two samples of galaxies ; the [ o ii ]  emitter sample and the total galaxy sample ( i.e. , both galaxies with and without [ o ii ]  emission ) . the former one is used to identify actively star - forming galaxies .",
    "the latter one is necessary to estimate the galaxy local density for each position in the cosmos field .",
    "we carried out the imaging survey for [ o ii ]  emitters at @xmath0 with a narrow - band filter nb816 ( see ajiki et al .",
    "2003 for details ) in the cosmos 2 square degree field , using the suprime - cam ( miyazaki et al .",
    "2002 ) on the subaru telescope ( kaifu et al .",
    "2000 ; iye et al .",
    "this survey covers a sky area of 6700 arcmim@xmath16 in the cosmos field , and a redshift range between 1.17 and 1.20 for [ o ii ]   ( @xmath17 , corresponds to 70 mpc in the comoving distance ) , corresponding to a survey volume of @xmath18mpc@xmath19 . we have obtained a sample of 3176 [ o ii ]  emitters from this data , down to @xmath20 .",
    "the selection threshold of the [ o ii ]  ew is @xmath21   in the observed frame , or @xmath21   in the rest frame ( see takahashi et al .",
    "2007 for more details ) .",
    "we use a sub - sample of this parent sample of [ o ii ]  emitters for our analysis and discussion . to identify both galaxies with and without [ o ii ]  emission in the range of @xmath22 ( i.e. , the coverage of the nb816 filter for [ o ii ]  emitters ) , we select galaxies with a photometric redshift ( photo-@xmath23 , @xmath24 ) in the range of @xmath25 from the cosmos photo-@xmath23 catalog ( ilbert et al .",
    "2008 ) . since fainter galaxies have larger photo-@xmath23 errors , we select only bright galaxies to avoid possible contaminations .",
    "specifically we limit our sample only in galaxies with @xmath26 , because the estimated photo-@xmath23 error is @xmath27 for galaxies with @xmath28 24 and @xmath29 .",
    "note that photo-@xmath23 errors for galaxies with @xmath30 and @xmath31 are @xmath32 and 0.07 , respectively .",
    "consequently we obtain 1553 galaxies with @xmath22 and @xmath26 .",
    "we find by cross - checking these two samples that 965 among 1553 photo-@xmath23 selected galaxies are [ o ii ]  emitters selected by takahashi et al ( 2007 ) .",
    "the other 588 objects are galaxies without [ o ii ]  emission ( more strictly , without [ o ii ]  emission with ew @xmath33   rest - frame ) .",
    "the sfr of [ o ii ]  emitters are estimated through the relation of sfr @xmath34([oii ] ) @xmath35 ( kennicutt 1998 ) .",
    "the minimum and maximum sfr values in our sample of the [ o ii ]  emitters ( with @xmath26 ) is 12 @xmath35 and 275 @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "the spatial distribution of all galaxies in our sample at @xmath22 is presented in fig .",
    "this figure shows that our sample includes galaxies in various density regions , and therefore the sample is suitable to investigate the environmental effects on the star - formation activity in galaxies at @xmath0 .",
    "we estimate how our photo-@xmath23 sample is contaminated by foreground or background objects .",
    "we use 22 objects with the spectroscopic redshifts ( spec-@xmath23 : class `` 3 '' and class `` 4 '' in lilly et al .",
    "2007 ) to examine the accuracy of our photo-@xmath23 estimation . among these objects ,",
    "18 objects have spec-@xmath23 similar to our target range , @xmath22 , within the photo-@xmath23 error , @xmath37 , while the remaining objects have spec-@xmath23 out of this redshift range .",
    "the expected contamination rates for the photo-@xmath23 sample are thus estimated to be 18% .",
    "we also estimate the incompleteness of our photo-@xmath23 sample , using 22 objects with the spec-@xmath23 within our target range . among these objects ,",
    "17 objects have photo-@xmath23 in our target range within the photo-@xmath23 error . the expected incompleteness rate for the photo-@xmath23 sample are thus estimated to be 22% . from these results , we consider that at least about 80% of photo-@xmath23 in our sample is reliable .",
    "we will show that this contamination and incompleteness do not affect on our results .",
    "as described in  2.1 , we selected 965 [ o ii ]  emitters and 588 non - emitters .",
    "accordingly , @xmath38 62 % of galaxies at @xmath0 are [ o ii ]  emitters .",
    "we show the @xmath39-band number count of our sample in fig .",
    "this figure shows that the emitter fraction does not depend significantly on the @xmath39 magnitude .",
    "this indicates that more than half of galaxies at @xmath0 are active star - forming galaxies , regardless of galaxy magnitude .",
    "this is completely different from the properties of [ o ii ]  emitters in the local universe .",
    "gmez et al .",
    "( 2003 ) reported that the median [ o ii ]  equivalent width of galaxies in the local universe in the sloan difital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ) early data release ( edr ; stoughton et al .",
    "2002 ) sample is @xmath40  and the [ o ii ]  emitter fraction ( i.e. , the rest - frame [ o ii ]  equivalent width larger than 12   ) is @xmath41% , much lower than our result at @xmath0 ( @xmath42 % ) .",
    "this is consistent to the redshift evolution of the sfrd between @xmath0 and @xmath43 ( e.g. , lilly et al .",
    "1996 ; fujita et al .",
    "2003 ) .      here",
    "we examine the relation between the star - formation activity and the galaxy environment .",
    "we adopt the projected 10th - nearest - neighbor surface density as an indicator of the galaxy environment , following the manner in dressler ( 1980 ) .",
    "this density is estimated by using the distance to the 10th nearest neighbor from each object .",
    "this distance defines used to estimate the surface density as @xmath44 galaxies near the edge of our field of view , i.e. , the @xmath45 is greater than the distance from the edge , are not used in the analysis since the local galaxy density of such galaxies is not correctly estimated . as discussed in  2.1 , we limit our sample only in galaxies with @xmath26 .",
    "this limiting magnitude corresponds to @xmath46 , adopting the typical sed in our sample .",
    "this limit is close to those used by gmez et al .",
    "( 2003 ) [ @xmath47 and dressler ( 1980 ) [ @xmath48 ; note that these magnitudes are re - calculated by using the cosmology adopted in our paper .",
    "our local galaxy density of 1 @xmath49 corresponds to @xmath50 @xmath49 if adopting the cosmology used by gomez et al .",
    "note that dressler ( 1980 ) calculated the local galaxy density differently from our method ; i.e. , we eliminate foreground and background galaxies using photometric redshift . thus our 10th nearest neighbor is much farther away than that obtained through dressler s definition .",
    "therefore we do not compare our results with those of dressler ( 1980 ) .    to quantify the typical star - formation activity of galaxies as a function of the local galaxy density , we use the fraction of [ o ii ]  emitters .",
    "we expect a positive or negative dependence of the [ o ii ]  emitter fraction on the number density of galaxies , if the star - formation activity at @xmath6 has any preferences on galaxy environments .",
    "we show the relation between the [ o ii ]  emitter fraction and the local galaxy density in fig .",
    "we then apply a linear fit to obtain the relation , @xmath51 .",
    "we find no significant correlation between the [ o ii ]   emitter fraction and the local galaxy density .",
    "the star - formation activity is almost constant at any local densities , although we see a marginal signature of positive correlation between the star - formation activity and the local galaxy density .",
    "this trend appears to be different from the relation in the local universe .",
    "it should be noted that the redshift bin size in our sample ( @xmath17 ) is comparable to the photo-@xmath23 error ( @xmath37 ) . in order to examine how the photo-@xmath23 uncertainty affects our results ,",
    "we have made a similar analysis adopting a larger redshift bin size of @xmath52 , considering the photo-@xmath23 error . in this case",
    ", we still obtained the result that the star formation activity tends to be higher in higher density regions . to be consistent with previous studies ( dlessler 1980 )",
    ", we used a criterion of the 10th nearest neighbor .",
    "we have tried to adopt a lower value ( 3rd and 5th ) and found the same trend of the results shown in fig .",
    "3 .      here",
    "we consider the possible influence of the contamination and incompleteness on the photo-@xmath23 catalog .",
    "as mentioned in  2.2 , the estimated photo-@xmath23 contamination and incompleteness is @xmath53 .",
    "it is thought that our main result is not affected by the contamination and incompleteness , except for the case that the fraction of contamination or incompleteness depends strongly on the number density of galaxies .",
    "this is unlikely , because the photo-@xmath23 errors mainly depend on the photometric accuracy , which is independent on the environment except for highly confused regions ( not majority in our sample ) . even if we overestimate or underestimate @xmath54 , the data points on fig .",
    "3 would shift just slightly along the @xmath55 .",
    "we thus conclude that the contamination and incompleteness of the photo-@xmath23 sample does not affect significantly on our results and discussion .",
    "our results imply that star - formation activity is also high in high density regions at @xmath0 , showing a different trend from that seen in the local universe ( fig.3 ) . here",
    "we consider what is the origin of this difference between @xmath6 and @xmath3 .",
    "as a possible origin , we expect the influence of the galaxy interaction or merger because it is known that companion galaxies ( galaxy interactions and mergers ) can trigger star formation ( e.g. , taniguchi & wada 1996 ) .",
    "we investigate environmental effects on the fraction of non - isolated galaxies ( non - isolated fraction ) to study if galaxy interaction and mergers relate to star - formation in high density regions at @xmath6 . to define the subsamples of isolated galaxies and non - isolated galaxies",
    ", we searched for the nearest neighbor for each galaxy in the sample satisfying the following two conditions : @xmath56 and @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the @xmath60 magnitudes of a target object and its nearest neighbor , respectively .",
    "we define non - isolated galaxies as objects that have the nearest neighbors within the apparent separation less than 10 arcsec .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath38 80 kpc in proper distance , being similar to the distance between our galaxy and its satellite galaxies .",
    "the remaining objects are defined as isolated galaxies .",
    "we note that our non - isolated galaxies does not include galaxies having a very small effect of the gravitational interaction between galaxies since we adopt the following condition : @xmath61 .",
    "we find that the fraction of the non - isolated galaxies is 37% over the whole sample , including both the 43% [ o ii ]  emitters and 28% non - emitters ( table 1 ) . and",
    ", 71% of all non - isolated galaxies in the sample are [ o ii ]  emitters ( table 2 ) , suggesting that interacting and/or merging galaxies tend to be star - forming galaxies . based on the results of our classification",
    ", we study the relation between the non - isolated fraction among the [ o ii ]  emitters and the local galaxy density . here",
    "we again adopt @xmath54 as a measure of the local density .",
    "4 shows the results of this relation .",
    "the linear fit gives the relation , @xmath62 .",
    "this result shows that the non - isolated fraction is higher in denser regions and suggest that galaxies in high density regions have a greater tendency to interact or merge than low density regions . in order to confirm",
    "whether interacting and merging galaxies are related to star- formation in high density regions , we plot the non - isolated fraction among the [ o ii ]  emitters as a function of the local galaxy density ( fig . 5 ) .",
    "5 shows that the non - isolated fraction among the [ o ii ]  emitters increases with increasing local density .",
    "these results indicate that galaxy interactions and/or mergers tend to occur in higher density regions .",
    "we make the same analysis with @xmath63 as a test , and find the same trend as seen in fig . 4 and fig . 5 .",
    "in the local universe , it is well known that the star formation in galaxies is inactive in high density regions ( e.g. , gomez et al . 2003 ; mateus et al .",
    "for instance , gomez et al . ( 2003 ) found an overall shift of [ o ii ]  equivalent width distributions to lower values in high - density regions based on their analysis on the sdss data .",
    "however our results show that the relation between the fraction of [ o ii ]   emitters and the local galaxy density at @xmath0 appears to be flat , or to show a slight positive correlation ( fig .",
    "this implies that star formation in high density regions is also active , showing the different trend from that seen in the local universe .",
    "recently , elbaz et al . ( 2007 ) and cooper et al . (",
    "2008 ) reported that the mean sfr of galaxies is higher in higher density regions at @xmath6 , that is completely different from the tendency seen at @xmath3 .",
    "specifically , elbaz et al . ( 2007 ) studied the mean sfr of galaxies in the goods fields at @xmath6 by using both uv and ir luminosity , and found that it depends positively on the local galaxy density . on the other hand ,",
    "using the sfr measured with [ o ii ]  luminosities , cooper et al .",
    "( 2008 ) also studied that the mean sfr - local galaxy density relation in the deep2 and the sdss and found a similar trend .",
    "both analysis indicate that the star - formation activity in high density regions is higher than that in low density regions at @xmath6 , unlike the case of the local universe .",
    "this gives close agreement with our results on the relationship between the [ o ii ]  fraction and density that the environmental dependence of the star - formation activity in galaxies is completely different between @xmath6 and @xmath3 .",
    "here we discuss the following question ; what is the origin of this difference between @xmath6 and @xmath3 ?",
    "such a different trend was predicted by semi - analytic models for the hierarchical galaxy formation , in the sense that galaxies in the denser regions evolve more earlier in the history of universe ( elbaz et al .",
    "moreover , it is also claimed observationally that the evolution of galaxies occurred earlier in higher density regions , that is suggested by the discovery that the build - up of the color - magnitude relation appears to be delayed in lower - density environments ( tanaka et al .",
    "2005 ) . as a possible origin of the difference between @xmath6 and @xmath3",
    ", we expect the influence of the galaxy interaction or merger because it is known that galaxy interaction and merger trigger intense star formation ( e.g. , taniguchi & wada 1996 ; mihos & hernquist 1996 ; taniguchi at al .",
    "that is , many galaxies in higher density regions could have experienced interaction and/or merging with star formation in the past , and then the star formation in them becomes inactive because they gradually consume their gas . as a consequence",
    ", the number density of active star - forming galaxies could shift from high density regions to low density regions with time .",
    "if our interpretation is correct , it is expected that there are many interacting and/or merging galaxies in higher density regions at high redshift . in order to examine this expectation",
    ", we studied the morphology of the galaxies , as already described in  3.4 .",
    "we found that the fraction of non - isolated galaxies in the [ o ii ]  emitter sample is higher than in the non-[o ii ]  emitter sample ( see tables 1 and 2 ) .",
    "in addition , the non - isolated fraction among the whole sample ( including both [ o ii ]  and non-[o ii ]  emitters ) increases with increasing local galaxy density ( fig .",
    "4 ) and the non - isolated fraction among the [ o ii ]  emitters is higher in denser region ( fig . 5 ) .",
    "these results show that galaxy interactions and/or mergers tend to occur in higher density regions , inducing their active star formation .",
    "note that the non - isolated fraction among the [ o ii ]  emitters does not reach unity in high density regions , although it is significantly higher than this in lower density regions .",
    "we speculate that some advanced - merger and/or minor - merger systems are included in the [ o ii ]  emitter at high density regions , which seems to be hard to be recognized as non - isolated galaxies morphologically .",
    "our results are consistent with our expectation that interaction and/or merger induced star formation is a possible origin of star formation in high density regions at @xmath0 .    here",
    "we mention that the ram - pressure affects the star - formation activity in high density regions in addition to the galaxy interaction and/or mergers .",
    "this is because the gas stripping due to the ram - pressure generally quenches the star formation in clusters of galaxies ( e.g. , gunn & gott 1972 ; hester 2006 ) .",
    "however , the ram - pressure does not significantly influence our results , since our sample does not include very high density regions such as central regions of clusters of galaxies .",
    "therefore we consider that the star - formation activity of galaxies in high density regions is induced by the galaxy interaction , at @xmath6 . here",
    "we point out that the gas fraction in galaxies is higher at @xmath6 than that at @xmath3 even in high density regions .",
    "this difference results in that the galaxy mergers at @xmath6 tend to be `` wet '' , while the galaxy mergers at @xmath3 tend to be `` dry '' ( e.g. , lin et al .",
    "2008 ) . since the wet mergers naturally result in active star formation ( e.g. , woods et al . 2006",
    "; bridge et al . 2007 ) , the star formation is induced by interacting and/or merging galaxies even in high density regions , at @xmath6 . on the contrary",
    ", galaxy interactions and mergers in high density regions do not cause active star formation at @xmath3 .",
    "this picture is completely consistent to the results of elbaz et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and of cooper et al .",

    "that is , galaxies in high density regions have experienced interacting and/or merging with star formation at @xmath2 , while the star formation in them becomes because their gas is gradually consumed .",
    "and so the number density of active star - forming galaxies shifted from high density regions to low density regions with time .",
