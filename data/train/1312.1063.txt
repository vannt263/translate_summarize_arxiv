    "at these wavelengths , irdcs still appear dark but have smaller optical depths .",
    "our method also requires us to examine the fir extinction law and its possible variations within dense gas , which may be caused by grain coagulation and ice mantle formation .",
    "we utilize _ spitzer_-mips @xmath12 images from the mipsgal survey @xcite that have 6  resolution and estimated @xmath13 noise level of @xmath14mjy / sr .",
    "we also analyze archival @xmath15 _ herschel_-pacs images . the first type ( proposal i d kpgt - okrause-1 )",

    "these data are useful for assessing intensity of the galactic background emission , which needs to be interpolated from regions surrounding the irdc .",
    "both the _ herschel _ data sets are obtained already processed to level  2.5 in hipe , so zero - level offsets need to be applied to have measurements of absolute values of specific intensities .",
    "we adopted a model spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the diffuse galactic plane emission ( li & draine 2001 [ ld01 ] ) from nir to fir .",

    "a single offset value was then applied to each _ herschel _ dataset ( 908  mjy / sr and 241  mjy / sr for medium and fast scan data , respectively ) .",

    "for these , we adopt @xmath13 noise levels of 0.3  mjy / sr , 0.3  mjy / sr , 0.7  mjy / sr , 0.6  mjy / sr , respectively @xcite .",
    "to compare multiwavelength extinction mapping pixel by pixel , we regrid the irac images to the 24  mips frame with its @xmath26 pixels , similar to the 1.2  irac pixels .",
    "however , for _ herschel_-pacs data , with its 3.2  pixels , we first carry out extinction mapping on the original pixel grid ( especially searching for saturated pixels , see below ) , before finally regridding to the mips frame for multiwavelength comparison .",
    "we adopt the 1d radiative transfer model of bt12 , which requires knowing the intensity of radiation directed toward the observer at the location just behind , @xmath27 , and just in front , @xmath28 , of the target irdc .",
    "the infrared emission from the irdc is assumed to be negligible ( which imposes an upper limit on the dust temperature of @xmath18k ; @xcite ) , so that @xmath29 where optical depth @xmath30 and @xmath31 is total opacity at frequency @xmath32 per unit total mass and @xmath1 is the total mass surface density .",
    "the value of @xmath27 is to be estimated via a suitable interpolation from the region surrounding the irdc , while @xmath28 is to be derived from the observed intensity to given locations towards the cloud .",
    "however , because the observed galactic background emission , @xmath33 , and the observed intensity just in front of the irdc , @xmath34 , are contaminated with foreground emission , @xmath35 , ( irdcs are typically at several kpc distance in the galactic plane ) we actually observe @xmath36 and @xmath37 therefore , like mirex mapping , firex mapping requires measurement of @xmath35 towards each region to be mapped .",
    "following bt12 , we estimate @xmath35 empirically by looking for spatially independent dark regions that are `` saturated '' , i.e. they have the same observed intensity to within some intensity range set by the noise level of the image . using @xmath38 glimpse images with 2  resolution and @xmath13 noise level of 0.6  mjy / sr , bt12 defined saturated pixels as being within a 2@xmath39 range above the observed global minimum value in a given irdc .",
    "however , for the irdc to be said to exhibit saturation , these pixels needed to be distributed over a region at least 8  in extent .",
    "we follow a similar method here for the images in the irac bands at 24 and 70 , but with the following differences : ( 1 ) we search for `` local saturation '' in smaller 1  by 1  fields of view that contain dense cores previously identified by bt12 .",
    "this helps to minimize the effects of foreground spatial variation .",
    "( 2 ) in addition to a standard @xmath40 intensity range we also consider @xmath41 and @xmath42 ranges .",
    "this is because we regard the estimate of the noise level in the images as somewhat uncertain .",
    "we will gauge the liklihood of saturation also by considering the morphology ( e.g. connectedness ) of the saturated pixels , together with their overlap with saturated pixels at other wavelengths .",
    "in general we expect the saturated region to be larger at wavelengths with larger dust opacities ( i.e. generally increasing at shorter wavelengths ) , but the size is also affected by the relative noise levels in the different wavebands .",
    "the ability to detect saturation can also be compromised by the presence of a nearby source that enhances the local level of foreground emission .",
    "( 3 ) given the larger beam sizes at 24 and 70 , we adopt a less stringest spatial extent criterion , requiring separation of saturated pixels by about two times the beam fwhm , i.e. 12 .",
    "our method for estimating the background intensity is the same adopted by bt09 and bt12 , i.e. the small median filter method applied outside the defined irdc ellipse from s06 ( filter size set to 1/3 of the major axis , i.e. 4 ) , followed by interpolation inside this ellipse .",
    "we inspected the background fluctuations in three control fields equal to this filter size just outside the ellipse : after foreground subtraction the average @xmath13 fluctuations ( from a fitted gaussian ) were 17.3% , 25.3% and 42.3% at 8 , 24 , 70 , respectively . in the optically thin limit , these values provide an estimate of the uncertainty in the derived @xmath43 and thus @xmath1 in any given pixel due to background fluctuations .",
    "following bt09 , we adopt a spectrum of the diffuse galactic background from the model of ld01 .",
    "we will see below that a by - product of our extinction mapping is a measurement of this spectrum of the foreground emission .",
    "we then consider several different dust models ( table  [ tb : kappa ] ) , especially the thin and thick ice mantle models for moderately coagulated ( i.e. coagulation for @xmath44yr at @xmath45 ) grains ( oh94 ) .",
    "for all models we adopt a total ( gas plus dust ) mass to refractory dust mass ratio of 142 ( * ? ? ?",
    "the value of 156 used in bt09 and bt12 ) .",
    "this choice will not affect measurement of relative opacities .",
    "finally , we obtain the effective opacities in different wavebands , i.e. convolution of the background spectrum , filter response function and opacity function ( see fig .  [",

    "seen in the top panels of these figures , the 8  saturation is more widespread than seen by bt12 , i.e. in c1 and c4 , which is a consequence of searching in local regions and thus reducing the masking effect of foreground variations .",
    "there is generally good correspondence of saturated regions across the different wavebands , although this can be disrupted by the presence of discrete sources .",
    "there is a tendency for saturation to be more extended at 8 and 24 , than at 70  ( however , not in c11 ) .",

    "comparing the 2 , 4 , 8@xmath39-defined saturated regions , we see coherent , contiguous morphologies , which indicates that these levels are revealing real cloud structures and that the image noise levels are reasonably well - estimated .",
    "we derive the specific intensities of the galactic foreground towards c1 , c4 , c11 , also including measurements in irac bands 1 to 3 at the locations of 8  pixels showing @xmath40-saturation .",
    "we plot these intensities , normalized by the 8  values , on figure  [ fig : wholecloud]b . in general",
    ", these measurements agree well with the ld01 model .",
    "the 24  values are consistently about a factor of two smaller , while the 70  values are a few tens of percent larger .",
    "these particular ratios are sensitive to our choice of normalizing at 8 . in the irac bands 1 and 2 , the observed intensities are significantly lower than the ld01 model of total emission .",
    "however , there is reasonable agreement with just the dust component of galactic emission ( dotted line ) .",
    "this irdc is at 5  kpc distance , and this appears to be close enough that foreground stars are not making significant contributions to the foreground emission as measured on @xmath19arcsecond scales in these saturarted cores .      following the method described in ",
    "[ s : methods ] , given estimates of the foreground and background intensities towards each region we derive the extinction maps at 8 , 24 and 70 , displaying @xmath1 in @xmath53 under the assumption of opacities of the thick ice mantle model of oh94 ( middle rows of figs .",
    "[ fig : c1 ] , [ fig : c4 ] , [ fig : c11 ] ) . the choice of this thick , rather than thin",

    "thus @xmath1 is quite small , @xmath54 , but it can make more than a factor of 3 difference at 70 .",
    "the value of @xmath1 at which our saturation - based extinction mapping begins to start underestimating the true mass surface density is ( bt12 ) @xmath55 where @xmath28 is set equal to the @xmath40 noise level , i.e. 1.2 , 0.5 , 30  mjy / sr for the 8 , 24 , 70  images . at these wavelengths ,",
    "the saturated cores have average values of @xmath5692.7 , 53.7 , 1302.3  mjy / sr , respectively .",

    "note , as discussed by bt12 , higher values of @xmath1 than @xmath59 will be present in the map , but these will be tend to be more and more affected by saturation , leading to underestimation of the true @xmath1 values .",
    "the above analysis predicts that we should be able to probe to higher values of @xmath1 in the 70  maps than in the 8 and 24  maps , and that such high @xmath1 structures will be in regions that have been identified as being saturated at the two shorter wavelengths . in core / clump c1",
    ", we indeed see this morphology : the 70  map peaks at around @xmath60 at a position close to the c1 core center identified by bt12 and btk .",
    "this highest column density region is coincident with the c1-n @xmath61 core identified by tan et al .",
    "( 2013b ) .",
    "we also infer that the 70  map is revealing real structures in the range @xmath62 , which are not so reliably probed by the shorter wavelength maps .    in the c4 region",
    "we see two main high @xmath1 peaks that exhibit local saturation , with the western structure identified as c4 by bt12 and the eastern as c13 by btk . in between are two sources seen most clearly at 24 .",
    "these sources undoubtedly affect the mirex and firex methods in this region , so it is possible that there is a high @xmath1 bridge between the two cores .    in c11 ,",
    "there is a relatively widespread high @xmath1 region , which is part of a highly filamentary structure extending towards c12 to the ne ( btk ) .",
    "the 70  map also reveals a relatively high @xmath1 region extending to the nw .",
    "this extension is seen in the 8 and 24  maps , but at lower @xmath1 .",
    "it is possible that localized foreground variations at the shorter wavelengths are affecting the 8 and 24  maps ( see also btk , where this extension is more prominent in an 8  map derived with a finer decomposition of foreground variations ) .",
    "the relative values of @xmath1 derived in non - saturated regions at different wavelengths yield information about the shape of the dust extinction law .",
    "this law is expected to vary as grains undergo growth via coagulation and increasing deposition of volatiles , such as water , methanol and co , to form ice mantles ( see fig .  [",

    "the @xmath1 maps of figs .",
    "[ fig : c1 ] , [ fig : c4 ] and [ fig : c11 ] are derived assuming the moderately - coagulated thick ice mantle model of oh94 , so deviations in the @xmath1 ratios , e.g. @xmath63 , from unity tell us about deviations of the actual dust extinction law from the oh94 model .    in the bottom rows of figs .",
    "[ fig : c1 ] , [ fig : c4 ] and [ fig : c11 ] we present maps of @xmath64 , @xmath63 and @xmath65 .",
    "some of the variation in these ratio maps is due to the different saturation levels , i.e. the 70  map is able to probe to @xmath66 , while the other maps saturate at @xmath67 ( and tend to have ratio maps closer to unity ) .",
    "thus we focus on variations present in non - saturated regions , especially considering intervals of @xmath68 centered on @xmath69 . for pixels in these ranges ,",
    "we evaluate the mean values of @xmath64 and @xmath63 .",
    "these mean ratios can be reconciled to unity by assuming different values of @xmath70 and @xmath71 relative to @xmath72 , and these are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wholecloud]d for each of the three cores .",
    "we also derived @xmath1 maps in irac bands 1 , 2 and 3 for each of the three regions , following the same methods described above and in bt12 , and used their ratio maps compared to @xmath73 to explore opacity variations down to 3.5  ( fig .  [ fig : wholecloud]d ) .",
    "our fiducial maps use the total stars plus dust sed of the galactic background . if the spectrum of only the dust component is used ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : wholecloud]b ) , then the effective opacity would change by at most 10% .",
    "the relative opacity values from the mir to fir , generally follow the thick ice mantle models of oh94 . in particular the ratio of @xmath74 and , to a lesser extent , that of @xmath75 , favor such models . at shorter wavelengths ,",
    "the thick and thin ice mantle models are more similar , so there is less discriminatory power , although there is a hint that the 3.5  irac band is picking up growth of the 3  water ice feature .",
    "there are hints of a systematic increase in @xmath74 with increasing @xmath1 , especially in the regions around cores c1 and c4 , which would be consistent with basic expectations of grain evolution ( oh94 ) .",
    "however , a larger sample of regions is needed to confirm this trend .",
    "it is possible that systematic differences seen from core region to core region ( e.g. , the c1 region shows relatively lower 6 and 70  opacities ) could reflect real evolutionary differences between the regions .",
    "however , systematic temperature variations , if extending @xmath76k @xcite could affect firex maps at 70  and produce similar effects .    the opacity features in the thick ice mantle models around 3 , 6 , 20 and 50  are mostly caused by h@xmath77o ice , but ch@xmath78oh ice makes an @xmath79 contribution to the 6  feature @xcite .",
    "it is possible that astrochemical variations in the abundance of ch@xmath78oh could be contributing to the observed dispersion of the 6  opacity , and potentially also affecting the 8  opacity , which sets the normalization of the curves and data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wholecloud]d .",
    "again a larger sample of regions and a search for potential correlations with other astrochemical indicators is needed to assess these possibilities .",

    "<S> progress in understanding star formation requires detailed observational constraints on the initial conditions , i.e. dense clumps and cores in giant molecular clouds that are on the verge of gravitational instability . </S>",
    "<S> such structures have been studied by their extinction of near - infrared ( nir ) and , more recently , mid - infrared ( mir ) background light . </S>",
    "<S> it has been somewhat more of a surprise to find that there are regions that appear as dark shadows at far - infrared ( fir ) wavelengths as long as @xmath0 ! here we develop analysis methods of fir images from _ spitzer_-mips and _ herschel_-pacs that allow quantitative measurements of cloud mass surface density , @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the method builds upon that developed for mir extinction mapping ( mirex ) @xcite , in particular involving a search for independent saturated , i.e. very opaque , regions that allow measurement of the foreground intensity . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on three massive starless core / clumps in irdc g028.37 + 00.07 , deriving mass surface density maps from 3.5 to @xmath2 . a by - product of this analysis is measurement of the spectral energy distribution of the diffuse foreground emission . the lower opacity at @xmath2 allows us to probe to higher @xmath1 values , up to @xmath3 in the densest parts of the core / clumps . comparison of the @xmath1 maps at different wavelengths constrains the shape of the mir - fir dust opacity law in irdcs . </S>",
    "<S> we find it is most consistent with the thick ice mantle models of @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there is tentative evidence for grain ice mantle growth as one goes from lower to higher @xmath1 regions . </S>"
