    "in the present paper we consider overdetermined problems for the fractional laplacian in unbounded exterior sets or bounded annular sets .",
    "different cases will be taken into account , but the results obtained will lead in any case to the classification of the solution and of the domain , that will be shown to possess rotational symmetry .    the notation used in this paper will be the following . given an open set whose boundary is of class  @xmath0 , we denote by  @xmath1 the inner unit normal vector and for any  @xmath2 on the boundary of such set , we use the notation @xmath3 of course , when writing such limit , we always assume that the limit indeed exists and we call the above quantity the _ inner normal @xmath4-derivative _ of @xmath5 at  @xmath2 .",
    "the parameter  @xmath4 above ranges in the interval  @xmath6 and it corresponds to the fractional laplacian  @xmath7 .",
    "a brief summary of the basic theory of the fractional laplacian will be provided in section  [ sec : preliminaries ] : for the moment , we just remark that  @xmath7 reduces to ( minus ) the classical laplacian as  @xmath8 , and the quantity in   becomes in this case the classical neumann condition along the boundary .    with this setting",
    ", we are ready to state our results . for the sake of clarity , we first give some simplified versions of our results which are `` easy to read '' and deal with `` concrete '' situations .",
    "these results will be indeed just particular cases of more general theorems that will be presented later in section  [ ffgg ] .",
    "more precisely , the results we present are basically of two types . the first type deals with _ exterior sets_. in this case , the equation is assumed to hold in  @xmath9 , where  @xmath10 is a non - empty open bounded set of @xmath11 , not necessarily connected , whose boundary is of class  @xmath0 , and  @xmath12 denotes the closure of @xmath10 .",
    "we sometimes split @xmath10 into its connected components by writing @xmath13 where any @xmath14 is a bounded , open and connected set of class  @xmath0 , and , to avoid pathological situations , we suppose that @xmath15 is finite . notice that @xmath16 if @xmath17 .",
    "then , the prototype of our results for exterior sets is the following .",
    "[ thm : example ] let us assume that there exists @xmath18 such that @xmath19 then @xmath10 is a ball , and @xmath5 is radially symmetric and radially decreasing with respect to the centre of @xmath10 .",
    "the second case dealt with in this paper is the one of _",
    "annular sets_. namely , in this case the equation is supposed to hold in  @xmath20 , where  @xmath21 is a bounded set that contains  @xmath10 and such that  @xmath20 is of class @xmath0 .",
    "then , the prototype of our results for annular sets is the following .",
    "[ thm : example 2 ] let us assume that there exists @xmath18 such that @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes the inner ( with respect to @xmath20 ) normal @xmath4-derivative of @xmath5 . then @xmath10 and @xmath21 are concentric balls , and @xmath5 is radially symmetric and radially decreasing with respect to the centre of @xmath10 .",
    "we stress that , here and in the following , we do not assume that @xmath9 ( resp .",
    "@xmath20 ) is connected ; this is why we do not use the common terminology _ exterior domain _",
    "( resp . _ annular domain _ ) , which indeed refers usually to an exterior connected set ( resp .",
    "annular connected set ) .",
    "we also stress that , while the dirichlet boundary datum has to be the same for all the connected components of @xmath10 , the neumann boundary datum can vary .    overdetermined elliptic problems have a long history , which begins with the seminal paper by j. serrin @xcite .",
    "a complete review of the results which have been obtained since then goes beyond the aims of this work . in what follows , we only review the contributions regarding exterior or annular domains in the local case , and the few results which are available about overdetermined problems for the fractional laplacian",
    ".    overdetermined problems for the standard laplacian in exterior domains have been firstly studied by w. reichel in @xcite , where he assumed that both @xmath10 and @xmath9 are connected .",
    "in such a situation , w. reichel proved that if there exists @xmath24 ( i.e. of class @xmath0 up to the boundary of the exterior domain ) such that @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes the usual normal derivative , and @xmath27 is a locally lipschitz function , non - increasing for non - negative and small values of @xmath28 , then @xmath10 has to be a ball , and @xmath5 is radially symmetric and radially decreasing with respect to the centre of @xmath10 .",
    "the proof is based upon the moving planes method .    with a different approach , based upon the moving spheres ,",
    "a. aftalion and j. busca @xcite addressed the same problem when @xmath29 is not necessarily non - increasing for small positive values of its argument .",
    "in particular , they could treat the interesting case @xmath30 for @xmath31 .",
    "afterwards , b. sirakov @xcite proved that the result obtained in  @xcite holds without the assumption @xmath32 , and for possibly multi - connected sets @xmath10 .",
    "moreover , he allowed different boundary conditions on the different components of @xmath10 : that is , @xmath33 and @xmath34 on @xmath35 can be replaced by @xmath36 and @xmath37 on @xmath38 , with @xmath39 and @xmath40 depending on @xmath41 .",
    "his method works also in the setting considered in @xcite .",
    "we point out that in @xcite a quasi - linear regular strongly elliptic operator has been considered instead of the laplacian .",
    "concerning quasi - linear but possibly degenerate operators , we refer to @xcite .",
    "as far as overdetermined problems in annular domains is concerned , we refer the reader to @xcite . in @xcite , g. alessandrini proved the local counterpart of theorem [ thm : example 2 ] for quasi - linear , possibly degenerate , operators .",
    "this enhanced the results in @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", w. reichel considered inhomogeneous equations for the laplace operator in domains with one cavity .    regarding the nonlocal framework ,",
    "the natural counterpart of the j. serrin s problem for the fractional @xmath4-laplacian ( @xmath42 ) has been recently studied by m. m. fall and s. jarohs in @xcite . in such contribution the authors introduced the main tools for dealing with nonlocal overdetermined problems , such as comparison principles for anti - symmetric functions and a nonlocal version of the serrin s corner lemma .",
    "such results will be used in our work .",
