    "interestingly , the electrical properties of the graphene systems can be considered classical , in the sense that the measured conductance of the systems is found to increase with the increase of system width and to decrease with the increase of the system length @xcite .",
    "this experimental result can be understood as an evidence for the presence of disorder in the measured systems .",
