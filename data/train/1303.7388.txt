    "the multiple production of particles in high energy hadron interactions has received a lot of attention over the years .",
    "a renewal in interest in this topic coincided with the operation of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern . among the first results obtained at the lhc were the multiplicity measurements in proton - proton collisions .",
    "the atlas , cms , alice and lhcb collaborations provided high statistic data on multiplicity distributions ( mds ) of charged particles produced in the new super high energy domain .",
    "the study of particle production as a function of multiplicity has revealed the very popular koba - nielsen - olesen ( kno ) scaling @xcite . in @xmath0 collisions , scaling in the full phase - space holds up to the highest energy of the cern intersecting storage rings but it is clearly violated @xcite in the energy region of the cern super proton synchrotron collider and beyond .",
    "the strong violation of kno scaling was observed also at the lhc energy @xmath1  tev in the limited pseudorapidity intervals @xmath2 though for small pseudorapidity windows @xmath3 the scaling is approximately valid @xcite .",
    "a related phenomenon is the so - called negative binomial regularity which is the occurrence of the negative binomial distribution ( nbd ) in different interactions over a wide range of collision energies .",
    "the ua5 collaboration showed that mds of charged particles in non - single - diffractive ( nsd ) @xmath0 collisions can be described by nbd up to the energy @xmath4  gev both in the full phase - space @xcite and in symmetric pseudorapidity windows @xcite .",
    "first analysis of mds measured by the alice collaboration @xcite indicated that nbd describes the data in the small pseudorapidity window @xmath5 up to the energy @xmath6  gev @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of such a description is however subject to further disputes and investigations @xcite .",
    "much effort has been made to explain the negative binomial form of mds observed in many situations , still its physical origin has not been fully understood @xcite .",
    "the shape of md of charged particles produced in sufficiently large windows of pseudorapidity in high energy hadron - hadron collisions is quite different .",
    "the full phase - space data on multiplicities @xcite obtained from the nsd events in @xmath7 collisions at @xmath8  gev indicated that besides kno , the negative binomial regularity is violated as well .",
    "the measurements of md at the energy @xmath9  gev by the e735 collaboration @xcite at the fermilab tevatron showed even stronger deviation of data from nbd .",
    "though with large mutual discrepancies at high multiplicities , both data demonstrate a narrow maximum and a shoulder - like structure around @xmath10 . despite its correct qualitative behavior ,",
    "single nbd is not sufficient to describe the experimental data .",
    "more functions were suggested @xcite to investigate the properties of high energy multiple particle production .",
    "a systematic study of the complex form of mds was performed in the framework of the two - component model @xcite and its three - component modification @xcite . the multicomponent quark gluon string model ( qgsm ) @xcite",
    "was used @xcite to study the role of multiparton collisions .",
    "there also exist other approaches to particle production at high energies ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "the atlas @xcite , cms @xcite and alice @xcite collaborations measured mds of charged particles in proton - proton collisions at the lhc energies @xmath11 , 2.36 and 7  tev using different kinematic ranges and different classes of events .",
    "the measurements in the central pseudorapidity windows allow to study evolution of the narrow maximum and the broad shoulder of the distributions at high @xmath12 both with collision energy and pseudorapidity .",
    "the shoulder - like structure of md was investigated in the framework of independent pair parton interaction ( ippi ) @xcite .",
    "the ippi model was applied @xcite to experimental data measured by the cms collaboration @xcite at @xmath13  tev in various pseudorapidity intervals .",
    "the cms data were analyzed @xcite by weighted superposition of two nbds representing soft and semihard components of particle production .    in this paper",
    "we study the three - component description of data on md of charged particles produced in proton - proton collisions at the lhc . each component",
    "is represented by a single nbd and parametrized by two parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the total distribution is the weighted sum of three nbds with eight free parameters altogether .",
    "the high statistic data on md measured at the lhc allow us to extract these parameters in most cases reasonably well .",
    "the analysis of the atlas measurements @xcite shows us that the two - component description of md is unsatisfactory . within the multi - component nbd parametrization",
    ", the structure of the data indicates the necessity of a third component in the region of low multiplicities .",
    "the shape of the atlas data at low @xmath12 is critical to the ippi model and to the two - component superposition of nbds .",
    "the goal of our analysis is to obtain a detailed description of the high statistic data on md in @xmath16 collisions at the lhc in the framework of weighted superposition of three nbds and study its properties .",
    "we demonstrate that , besides the shoulder - like structure at high @xmath12 , the data manifest a distinct peak at a maximum which can be described by the third component of the total distribution .",
    "we show that the obtained parametrization of the lhc data on md reveals some invariant features .",
    "the multiple production of particles in the soft processes at high energies includes highly non - perturbative effects of qcd .",
    "a comparison of experimental data with various distributions relies mostly on phenomenological approaches in this field .",
    "the prominent role in the phenomenological description of data on md in @xmath17 collisions is the two - parameter nbd @xmath18^n \\left[\\frac{k}{k+\\bar{n}}\\right]^k .",
    "\\label{eq : r1}\\ ] ] the parameter @xmath14 is the average multiplicity and @xmath15 characterizes the width of the distribution . the poisson distribution is obtained for @xmath19 . a remarkable property is the convolution of nbds which results again in nbd with modified parameters .",
    "a superposition of nbds is a well - known idea exploited by different approaches to multiple particle production in hadron collisions .",
    "it is based on the assumption that md of the created particles can be expressed as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is given by ( [ eq : r1 ] ) . in the general case ,",
    "the corresponding number of free parameters is @xmath22 . in specific models of this type",
    ", the number of parameters can be smaller . in the ippi model",

    "the parameter @xmath23 is defined by the number @xmath28 of the independent active parton pairs via the normalization of the probabilities @xmath29 to unity .",

    "the md of the @xmath33 cut - pomerons contribution , @xmath21 , is assumed to have a poisson - like form .",
    "the characteristic feature of both models is an increase of the mean multiplicities @xmath34 ( @xmath35 $ ] ) with decreasing values of @xmath31 . in this paper",
    "we consider the function ( [ eq : r2 ] ) for @xmath36 in a formal way and try to establish values of the eight independent parameters ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) to obtain a detailed description of data on md measured with high accuracy in the experiments at the lhc .",
    "the mds of charged particles produced in proton - proton collisions at the lhc were measured both in the central and forward pseudorapidity region .",
    "the phenomenological studies of the measurements have been mainly carried out @xcite with the cms data . in this paper",
    "we present results of a combined analysis of data on md obtained by the atlas , cms and alice collaborations in the central interaction region and by the lhcb collaboration in the forward region .",
    "the atlas collaboration measured @xcite the charged particle md in different phase - space regions using various multiplicity cuts in the pseudorapidity window @xmath41 .",
    "the distributions are based on the experimental analysis of a large number of events which accumulated in particular at the energies @xmath1 and 0.9 tev .",
