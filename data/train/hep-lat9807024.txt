    "the spectrum of dirac operator is closely related to a number of important aspects in finite temperature qcd .",
    "the behavior of spectral density @xmath2 around @xmath3 for massless dirac operator is of particular physical interest being responsible for breaking the chiral symmetry @xcite .",
    "the low lying eigenvalues of staggered fermion operator are also used to extract the topological content of background gauge field configurations @xcite .    despite steady progress , the numerical simulation results for @xmath2 remain inconclusive . as it is known from general theoretical considerations",
    "( see e.g. @xcite ) , the eigenvalues of the normalized dirac operator are located in a compact area .",
    "however , as it pointed out in  @xcite perturbative calculations show even an increase of state density at large @xmath4 .",
    "indeed , for @xmath5 the spectral density is regarded to be insensitive to gluon vacuum fluctuations and behaves in the same way as for free fermions : @xmath6 this free term introduces quadratically divergent piece in @xmath7 .",
    "however , to get a truly non - perturbative quark condensate which is the order parameter of the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking , this perturbative divergent part should be subtracted . as a result",
    ", the quark condensate is related to the region of small @xmath4 : @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "some numerical results @xcite may be taken as an evidence in favor of compactness of dirac operator spectrum ( see fig .",
    "2,4,5 and 6 of ref .",
    "indeed , the spectral density disappears outside certain region @xmath9 @xcite , that for a particular case may be specified as : @xmath10 ( see fig .  2 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , or for @xmath11 ( see fig .  2 of ref .",
    "the domain wall fermion approach leads to a similar picture ( see @xcite fig .",
    "12 ) . in case of (",
    "1 + 1)-dimension it was proved @xcite , that the spectrum was contained inside the compact area ( circle of radius 2 in the complex plane )",
    ". moreover , compactness more often than not may be treated as implicit periodicity , so it is hard to avoid the assumption that the spectral density may appear a periodic function of @xmath12 indeed , the lattice regularization for dirac operator leads to @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 wilson parameter .",
    "let us assume that the fermion part of the action @xmath16 can be expressed in terms of polyakov loops @xmath17 as it can be done in numerous particular cases for the gluon part of the action , and @xmath18 .",
    "in this case one may expect that the dirac matrix @xmath19 ( as well as @xmath20 ) became periodic in @xmath21 @xmath22 with @xmath23 therefore , one may suspect that this condition , together with the periodicity along @xmath24 - axis , may induce the periodicity of @xmath25 in the complex plane of @xmath26 and , hence , in eigenvalues @xmath12 in other words it would not be too surprising if @xmath27    indeed , if to take the free dirac operator as an example @xcite , the spectrum in the phase @xmath28 is given by : @xmath29 and @xmath30 for @xmath31 .",
    "more rigorous and convincing evidence in favor of the periodicity of dirac operator spectrum in general case was suggested in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , dirac operator can be presented @xcite as @xmath32 where @xmath33 some hermitian matrix and @xmath34 $ ] .",
    "therefore , if @xmath25  satisfies the ginsparg - wilson relation @xcite @xmath35 then the operator @xmath36  is unitary @xmath37 this implies that the spectrum of @xmath25  lies in the complex plane @xcite on the circle , @xmath38  with @xmath39 $ ] considering the above , a banks - casher - like relation @xcite will be @xmath40    the periodicity of dirac spectrum @xmath41 in @xmath42 may be , as a matter of course , treated as a lattice artefact indeed , assuming that the major part of eigenstates is concentrated in the area @xmath43 @xcite after redefinition of the integration variable @xmath44 and lifting lattice regularization @xmath45 one comes to the standard banks - casher relation @xmath46    though , one should also consider the possibility that e.g. , @xmath47 , with @xmath48 in this case the spectrum remains invariant under the shift @xmath49 the banks - casher relation , of course , remains valid in all cases , however , premature lifting the lattice regularization in @xmath50 leaves the conjectural periodicity hidden .",
    "certainly , the arguments given above , will not suffice as such and we must admit , that the assumption @xmath51 looks much more controversial then the evidences given in favor of compactness .",
    "below we briefly sketch the results @xcite obtained in the approximation , where all terms proportional to @xmath52 have been discarded is defined as @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are temporal and spatial lattice spacings , respectively . ] in a hamiltonian limit @xmath56 @xmath57 the spectral density computed in such an approximation is actually periodic .",
    "this reassures us a bit and allows us to assume that the periodicity may appear to be a general feature of the spectral density of dirac operator .",
    "hereafter we consider some consequences which follow from such an assumption for a more general case .",
    "in a toy model approximation the fermion determinant can be computed analytically and presented in a closed form .",
    "we choose the form suggested in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) for the fermion part of action @xmath58 where @xmath59  refers to the number of flavors and @xmath60 are given by @xmath61 .",
    "inasmuch as in the suggested approximation we omit the terms of @xmath52 order , the toy action will be simply @xmath62 .",
    "the projectors @xmath63 divide the bispinors @xmath64 into two components @xmath65 each including only one two - component spinor .",
    "therefore , taking into account that @xmath66  and presenting @xmath67 we may rewrite @xmath68  as @xmath69 where @xmath70    by gauge transformation all @xmath71 matrices may be diagonalized simultaneously : @xmath72 therefore @xmath73 in @xmath74 is simply a set of @xmath75 matrices @xmath76 hopefully , the computation of @xmath77 in the considered extremely simple case can be done straightforwardly and after the integration over @xmath78 we get @xmath79 with @xmath80 where @xmath81 for periodic and @xmath82 for antiperiodic border conditions on fermion fields in a temporal direction .",
    "thereafter we shall consider the standard case @xmath82 and even values @xmath83 , because the generalization on @xmath81 and odd @xmath83 is quite evident .",
    "it easy to see from @xmath84 and @xmath85 that @xmath86 may be presented as @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the mirror fermion mass connected to wilson parameter by the relation @xmath89",
    "recall that the fermion green s function in the external gauge fieldis given by @xmath90 where @xmath91 eigenvalues of the _ massless _ dirac operator and @xmath92 are corresponding eigenfunctions .",
    "the spectrum of the massless dirac operator is discrete and enjoys  the chiral symmetry . in particular , for any eigenfunction @xmath93 , the function @xmath94  is the eigenfunction as well , with the eigenvalue @xmath95 therefore @xmath96 and eigenfunctions occur in pairs with opposite eigenvalues , except for zero modes does not mean chiral invariance .",
    "indeed , the eigen functions of dirac operator are the same for @xmath97 and @xmath98 therefore , the symmetry @xmath99 is preserved for arbitrary @xmath26 , though only massless dirac operator is invariant under transformation @xmath100 . ] . in the limit @xmath101 ,",
    "the level spectrum becomes dense and we can trade the sum in @xmath102 for the integral and get @xmath103 where @xmath104 in case when spectral density is compact and periodic with the some period @xmath105@xmath106 we can write @xmath107 or @xmath108 presenting ( @xcite 5.1.25(3 ) ) @xmath109 we get @xmath110    so we come to the conclusion that @xmath111 is nothing but a particular case of @xmath112 for the periodic spectral density @xmath113 with the period @xmath114 it easy to check that it leads to the expression for @xmath115 that coincides with @xmath111 obtained in a toy model approximation@xmath116    if one claims @xmath117 and @xmath118 where all @xmath119 are integer , one can easily get an expression for @xmath120 which coincides with the result obtained in @xcite for @xmath121 gauge group case was chosen intentionally to achieve such coincidence . ] .",
    "so we come to the conclusion that the toy model gives the results that may appear reasonable in the general case @xmath122 if periodicity assumption happens to be allowable .",
    "a very formal expression of the symmetry @xmath123 @xmath124 can be found if we take into account the following .",
    "as it is known the transformation under @xmath125  reversal can be presented as a combination of the unitary  transformation  rotated by an angle @xmath126 is , in fact , the remnant of chiral symmetry of the massless theory . ] @xmath127 and inversion @xmath128 . under unitary transformation as well as under inversion",
    "the massless dirac operator @xmath129 only changes the sign .",
    "therefore , the result of the unitary transformation of @xmath130 can be mimicked by the formal substitution @xmath131 it is easy to check that @xmath132 invariance also leads to @xmath133 symmetry @xmath134    to be specific , we confine ourselves to the case of @xmath135 gauge group .",
    "taking into account that @xmath136 where @xmath137 are the characters of irreducible representations of @xmath135 group , we can obtain from @xmath138@xmath139 so the breakdown of the symmetry @xmath99 ( and consequently @xmath140 ) by the second term in @xmath141 for any @xmath142 became apparent .",
    "moreover , @xmath143 posses an undesirable invariance under the interchange @xmath144 this invariance is inherent neither for dirac operator nor for the spectrum @xmath145 it the limit @xmath56 such symmetry is cognate to the invariance under the hopping parameter interchange : @xmath146 which plays an important role in the emergence of conjectural aoki phases , widely discussed in literature ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "although the mirror fermion input does not disappear in @xmath56 limit , almost all mirror terms exponentially vanish for @xmath147 .",
    "the only surviving term @xmath148 however , introduces finite contributions into @xmath149 which breaks @xmath150 symmetry .",
    "let us consider a very special case @xmath151 , in other words , put exactly @xmath152 in the action @xmath68 _ from the beginning .",
    "_    it is easy to see that in this case @xmath153 therefore @xmath154 and @xmath155 where @xmath156  are eigenvalues of the polyakov matrix @xmath157 in this case ( at least in zero order in @xmath52 ) mirror fermion term does not appear at all and terms leading in @xmath52 are invariant under the change",
    "@xmath158 @xmath116 the mirror fermion contributions in @xmath159are shifted into the area of infinite @xmath88 and undesirable symmetry @xmath160 is expired .",
    "it is interesting to note that , after harmless substitution @xmath161 the periodicity in @xmath4 may appear in a general case .",
    "indeed , we may expect that in the limit @xmath162 the mass variable will survive only in combination @xmath163 , where @xmath164 is some dimensionless number .",
    "thereby we get periodicity @xmath165 . taking into account that eigenvalues @xmath4 of the operator @xmath166 defined by @xmath167",
    "are related to eigenvalues @xmath168 of the operator @xmath130 by @xmath169 we also get ( as can be seen e.g. , from @xmath170 ) periodicity in @xmath4@xmath171    recall that for finite @xmath172 and @xmath88 one may write in a toy model approximation @xcite @xmath173 where @xmath174 thereby at finite @xmath175 we may expect only approximate periodicity in @xmath12 that evidently differs from the case of @xmath151 , which leads to @xmath176",
    "among the non - perturbative properties of quarks , those associated with the topology of the gauge fields occupy a special place .",
    "an important insight can be gained about the topological content of gauge field configurations in finite temperature qcd by computing the low lying modes of the dirac operator . in the continuum",
    "the dirac operator of massless fermions in a smooth background gauge field with non - zero topological charge has zero eigenvalues .",
    "the corresponding eigenfunctions are chiral and the number of left- and right - handed zero modes are related to the topological charge of the gauge configuration : @xmath177 @xcite . besides , the study of the dirac operator spectrum near @xmath178  is of fundamental importance for the understanding of chiral symmetry breaking in gauge theories .    unfortunately , the lattice formulation also introduces artifacts and there is no exact index theorem in this context . instead ,",
    "what is observed with the actions currently used is the `` zero mode shift '' phenomenon @xcite ( i.e. modes with small but non - zero eigenvalue and not exactly chiral ) .",
    "typical gauge field configurations contributing to the path integral are not smooth and , in addition , lattice regularization breaks some other conditions of the index theorem as well : the topological charge of coarse gauge configurations is not properly defined and dirac operator breaks chiral symmetry in an essential way @xcite . unlike the continuum , there is no division of lattice gauge fields into disconnected classes since lattice gauge fields are characterized by group elements on the links of the lattice and all link variables can be deformed to unity @xcite .    a noticeable progress in overcoming such difficulties was recently achieved . in particular , as it is argued in @xcite , the lattice qcd in fixed point formulation solves most of mentioned problems and in such context index theorem seems to be valid on the lattice .",
    "the lattice version of index theorem , which connects the small real eigenvalues of wilson - dirac operator and the geometrical definition of topological charge , was suggested in @xcite .",
    "reliable zero mode separation in numerical computations still remains a serious problem @xcite , so we hope that even crude analytical models , which allow to estimate @xmath2 behavior  in the area of small @xmath4 , may appear useful . notwithstanding the abrupt fall - off and vanishing of @xmath2  at @xmath178  measured in @xcite",
    "may be a finite volume effect @xcite , the present data par excellence do not confront the suggestion that @xmath179 is very small and compatible with zero . as it was shown in @xcite the spectral density decreases as @xmath4 approaches zero , and the larger is @xmath59",
    " the larger is the effect .",
    "the scenario when @xmath179 hits zero at @xmath180 is quite probable .",
    "dirac spectrum should be particularly sensitive to the effects of quark loops since fermion determinant for small quark mass strongly suppresses gauge configurations with small dirac eigenvalues .",
    "convincing arguments that spectral density disappears at @xmath178  are given in @xcite . as it is pointed out there ,",
    "the weight in averaging involves a fermion determinant factor @xmath181   ^{n_{f}}\\ = \\ \\left [   m^{\\left| \\nu\\right|   } \\prod_{\\lambda_{n}>0}(\\lambda_{n}^{2}+m^{2})\\right ]   ^{n_{f}% } .\\label{ind}%\\ ] ]  to be more specific we turn to the simple case of toy model approximation where fermion part of action can be totally separated from the gluon one and in accordance with @xmath182 incorporated into the measure by interchanging @xmath183\\rightarrow d\\tilde{\\mu}[\\varphi_{\\alpha}\\left (   x\\right )   ] $ ]  with @xmath184=\\prod_{\\alpha=1}^{n}\\left ( \\cosh\\frac{m}{t}+\\cos\\varphi_{\\alpha}\\left (   x\\right )   \\right )   ^{n_{f}}% d\\mu\\lbrack\\varphi_{\\alpha}\\left (   x\\right )   ] , \\label{meas}%\\ ] ] with @xmath185 so the measure @xmath186 has a set of @xmath59-multiple zeroes , which evidently corresponds to the zeroes of @xmath187 .",
    "the effective action @xmath188 $ ]  for gluon field ( e.g. the most popular @xmath189  suggested in @xcite ) remains finite and scarcely able to influence either multiplicity or locus of the zeroes .",
    "zero modes constitute no exception and are completely defined by the zeroes of @xmath186 .",
    "as it is easy to see from @xmath190 , the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath191 , defined by @xmath192 can be easily found from @xmath159 after the simple shift @xmath193@xmath194 and one can easily show that the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath195 differs from @xmath196 only by the sign of the real part .",
    "the expression @xmath196 plainly shows that real modes appear only in the limit @xmath197 and are placed at @xmath198 it should also be noted that zero modes created by the fields @xmath199 are divided into pairs @xmath200 as it is for @xmath201 and @xmath202 although the total numbers of the pairs @xmath203 and @xmath204 are equal , the corresponding sets of eigenvectors , of course , do not obligatory coincide , so @xmath205 and @xmath206 may differ .",
    "therefore , the topological nature of @xmath207 if any , needs special consideration .",
    "it is not incurious that the spectral density can be treated simply as a result of integration of the @xmath208 action over all variables @xmath209 but one @xmath21 or the integration over the surface with the fixed average @xmath210 for example , in case of @xmath211 gauge group one may write @xmath212    the relation between @xmath4 and the phases of polyakov loop eigenvalues @xmath213 makes it obvious that @xmath4 are not fixed numbers , the dependence @xmath4 on the parameters of the theory are defined not only by the fermion part of action , but by the gluon part as well . in particular ,",
    "zero modes are defined by the relative number of polyakov loops with @xmath214 @xmath215 @xmath216 @xmath217 .",
    "it is obvious that when the gauge fields are not fixed @xmath218 the behavior of the corresponding @xmath219 in the limit @xmath197 is generally different for different @xmath220 therefore , @xmath221does not result in an integer value for `  ` index @xmath222 and we obtain the probability distribution , @xmath223 , which is defined by @xmath224 .",
    "however , we can compute the extreme value of @xmath225 @xmath226 @xmath227    taking into account the condition @xmath228 we get @xmath229   , $ ] that both for @xmath211 and @xmath121 gives the same result @xmath230 .    in a series of papers @xcite",
    ", substantial new insight was added to this issue .",
    "their central assertion is that the spectral density of dirac operator very close to the origin @xmath178 should be universal , depending only on the symmetries in question .",
    "one of the amazing consequences of this conjecture is that the spectral density of dirac operator near the origin need not be computed in full @xmath208 , but can be extracted from simple models .",
    "we can not exclude that simple analytical structure of @xmath143 as in @xmath231  will not persist in the general case , moreover , such simplicity is in conflict with numerical results obtained in @xcite . if , nevertheless , one ventures to apply universality arguments @xcite to our model , it will lead to `  ` @xmath232 with @xmath233 and @xmath234 .",
    "thus , the configurations with small eigenvalues are effectively suppressed , and the larger @xmath59  is , the more prominent is the suppression . therefore ,",
    "in the computation of averages their contribution is small .",
    "it is true even for @xmath115 because @xmath235 has poles only in the points where fermion determinant turns to zero .",
    "we have presented some evidence in favor of periodicity suggestion for the spectral density of dirac operator on the lattice .",
    "indeed , such periodicity appears in the limit @xmath56 in a toy model approximation @xcite and in our opinion there are reasons to believe that it still persists in the general case .    in this paper",
    "we take advantage of the fact that the chiral invariance of the _ massless part _ of dirac operator leads to formal symmetry @xmath236 this symmetry is of importance in studying @xmath208 phase structure in ( @xmath237 ) space @xcite .",
    "it appears desirable to make such symmetry explicit on finite size lattice . in case of",
    "infinitely heavy mirror fermion @xmath238 , the symmetry @xmath133 is restored .",
    "moreover , the periodicity of spectral density  has also become explicit for @xmath152 already at finite @xmath175 .    besides , we suggest a simple way to relate the spectral density @xmath239 to the quasiaverage @xmath240 of @xmath208 action with polyakov loop matrices with @xmath241 @xmath242 at some point @xmath243 being fixed . as it can be anticipated ( see e.g.,@xcite ) the spectrum of dirac operator is not invariant under @xmath244 transformations and the results are different in the phases @xmath28  and @xmath245 nonetheless , for @xmath246 and @xmath247 the results coincide , which reflects @xmath248 - symmetry ( @xmath249 ) @xcite at zero density @xmath250    in this paper , we have taken a modest first step towards analytical investigation of dirac spectral density characteristics .",
    "apart from that there are many other questions which can be answered with the low lying eigenvalues and eigenvectors .",
    "the correlations between eigenvalues , the importance of which was proved in @xcite , is one of them .",
