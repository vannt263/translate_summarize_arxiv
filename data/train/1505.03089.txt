    "random matrices play an important role in physics , engineering and mathematics @xcite . while dealing with random matrices",
    "one often faces the problem of calculating eigenvalue spectra of sums and products of random matrices .",
    "this problem can be partially solved in the case of infinite invariant random matrices using methods of free probability which is a powerful technique developed recently @xcite . in practice , with some caution",
    ", one can use free probability results also as a good approximation for finite ( large ) matrices .",
    "free probability calculus was introduced in operator algebra @xcite .",
    "later one has realized that it can be also applied to random matrices in calculations of moments of sums and products of large invariant hermitian random matrices @xcite . in short , using free probability one can express the moment generating functions for a sum @xmath12 or a product @xmath13 of invariant random matrices @xmath14 and @xmath15 in terms of the moment generating functions of these matrices . if a random matrix is hermitian the knowledge of its moments is often sufficient to reconstruct its eigenvalue density .",
    "unfortunately the product @xmath16 , even for hermitian matrices , is generically non - hermitian . to get around this problem",
    "some authors @xcite consider a related hermitian random matrix @xmath17 , which has identical moments as @xmath18 : @xmath19 .",
    "unfortunately the eigenvalue density of @xmath20 , except for a special class of matrices , is not the same as of @xmath18 .",
    "so if one is interested in the eigenvalue density of @xmath18 one has to either apply different methods @xcite or to extend free probability calculus to the realm of non - hermitian matrices .",
    "for example , one might be interested in the eigenvalue density of the product of two independent gue matrices . clearly , the product is a non - hermitian matrix , its eigenvalues are complex and the eigenvalue density has a non - trivial support .",
    "actually one can find the limiting eigenvalue density of this product to be @xmath21 on the unit disk and zero outside the disk @xcite .",
    "non - hermitian random matrices have been studied in many contexts , including chaotic scattering @xcite , quantum chromodynamics with chemical potential @xcite , networks @xcite , lagged correlations @xcite , matrix - valued random walk @xcite and many others @xcite . as a result of these intensive studies one has developed analytic techniques to calculate the eigenvalue spectra of such matrices . in the heart of these techniques lies an electrostatic analogy @xcite . in this analogy eigenvalues of the random matrix",
    "play the role of positions of electric charges on two - dimensional plane and the green s function of electric field . given the green s function",
    "one can calculate the eigenvalue density from the gauss law @xcite .",
    "the green s function can be viewed as an subordinated element of a two - by - two matrix being an extended green s function .",
    "there were two independent approaches proposed for this extension : the first one was directly derived @xcite from the regularization of the electrostatic potential @xcite and the other one was obtained by a method of hermitization @xcite .",
    "both the constructions are equivalent to each other and both can be formulated in terms of quaternions as one can see from the today s perspective .",
    "the quaternionic nature of these equations was anticipated in @xcite and worked out in @xcite where a very deep geometrical understanding of the regularization procedure was achieved .",
    "more precisely , in the calculations one usually introduces a regulator @xmath22 .",
    "the modulus @xmath23 can be interpreted as a distance from the complex plane .",
    "this means that calculations are in fact performed in the quaternionic space in the neighborhood of the complex plane and only towards the end of the calculations , when the limit @xmath24 is taken , the problem is projected back to the complex plane .",
    "the idea is similar to that used in the sokhotski s formula ( [ eq : one - dim_delta ] ) for one - dimensional delta function on the real axis except that now it is applied to two - dimensional delta function on the complex plane . in order to exploit this similarity",
    "it is convenient to recall the cayley - dickson construction . in this construction complex numbers",
    "are defined as pairs of real numbers and quaternions as pairs of complex numbers . in the one - dimensional sokhotski s formula one",
    "sends the second element of the cayley - dickson pair ( imaginary part ) to zero @xmath24 and regains one - dimensional delta function on the real axis while for the two - dimensional case one sends the second element of the cayley - dickson pair forming quaternion to zero and recovers the delta function on the complex plane @xcite .    yet before the importance of the underlying quaternionic structure of the extended resolvents was recognized @xcite one was able to derive the corresponding extended r transform ( or equivalent blue function , sometimes used in physical literature ) and to formulate the addition law for non - hermitian matrices @xcite .",
    "this law was then successfully applied to a number of problems , while the multiplication law for non - hermitian matrices was formulated much later @xcite .",
    "although quaternionic picture emerged already a decade ago @xcite and has been applied to various problems @xcite , it has not been commonly adopted .",
    "the reason for this is probably related to the fact , that the synthetic picture of what is the r transform for non - hermitian matrices was still missing . it was not clear how the r transform was related to the moments of the random matrix or what was the classification of the r transform in the simplest case of gaussian laws , etc . we fill up this gap here .",
    "we show that the quaternionic structure of the resolvent and the r transform is capable to incorporate all mixed moments of random matrix and its hermitian conjugate : @xmath25 , for an asymptotic class of random matrix models define by the probability measure of the type ( [ muv ] ) for @xmath3 .",
    "in contrast to hermitian case , though , these moments can not be constructed from the moments of the eigenvalue density @xmath26 as they also depend on the left and right eigenvector correlations of the matrix @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "so in a sense , the green s function and the r transform encode also information about the eigenvector correlations .    the link between free probability and random matrices was established through planar combinatorics @xcite .",
    "in fact , the relation of random matrices to planar combinatorics was discovered long before free probability , by gaussian perturbation theory of invariant matrix models , which maps the problem of calculating moments of random matrices to enumeration of planar feynman diagrams @xcite .",
    "planar feynman diagrams can be enumerated by field theoretical methods , in particular by dyson - schwinger equations , which relate various moment generating functions @xcite .",
    "these equations are very powerful , as one can use them to derive all relations between generating functions known from free probability .",
    "the idea is very universal and it can be also applied to non - hermitian matrices to derive relations between the quaternionic r transforms for independent random matrices @xmath14 , @xmath15 and the corresponding sums @xmath12 @xcite and products @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "we follow this approach here .    while presenting the material",
    "we first recall the hermitian case , which is well known and directly linked to free probability , and then we use it as a reference point while showing construction of the corresponding objects for non - hermitian matrices .",
    "we begin with the green s function and then turn to the r transform .",
    "once we have recalled the definition of r transform for the non - hermitian matrices @xcite , we will classify all possible forms of this transform for gaussian elliptic ensembles @xcite .",
    "then we extend the discussion to non - gaussian invariant measures ( [ muv ] ) and link them to planar feynman diagrams @xcite .",
    "we recall the addition law @xcite and the multiplication law for non - hermitian matrices",
    "@xcite and use them to evaluate eigenvalue density for a couple of examples of products of gaussian random matrices from elliptic ensembles .",
    "we shortly summarize the paper in the last section . in appendix [ aa ]",
    "we recall the cayley - dickson construction of quaternions . in appendix [ ab ]",
    "we discuss quaternionic representation of the two - dimensional delta function , in appendix [ ac ] we recall the corresponding representation of the sum of delta functions located at the eigenvalues of a given non - hermitian matrix @xcite and finally in appendix d we discuss planar feynman diagrams @xcite and recall how to use the diagrammatic technique to derive the basic relations ( [ gf_r],[grquat ] ) between the green s function and the r transform .",
    "in this section we discuss green s functions ( resolvents ) for random matrix ensembles in the limit of large matrix size .",
    "we begin with the standard case of hermitian matrices and then generalize it to non - hermitian matrices .",
    "the generalization is closely related to the cayley - dickson construction of quaternions .",
    "we briefly recall this construction in appendix [ aa ] . for hermitian matrices eigenvalues are real and the corresponding resolvents are complex , while for non - hermitian matrices eigenvalues are complex and the corresponding green s functions are quaternionic .",
    "our goal is to calculate eigenvalue distribution of a random matrix @xmath27 which is defined by a probability measure @xmath28 .",
    "assume that @xmath27 is hermitian @xmath29 , so it has real eigenvalues .",
    "in the limit of infinite matrix size @xmath3 , the eigenvalue density of @xmath27 is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 s are eigenvalues of @xmath27 .",
    "it is convenient to define the green s function ( resolvent ) which is a complex function of a complex argument @xmath32 @xmath33 the symbol @xmath34 stands for the identity matrix of size @xmath35 .",
    "the eigenvalue density can be calculated from the resolvent ( [ eq : gf ] ) @xmath36 as follows from the sokhotski s representation of the one - dimensional dirac delta function @xmath37 the limit @xmath38 projects the problem to real axis .",
    "all eigenvalues are located on this axis ( [ eq : rhogreens ] ) .",
    "one can now implement an analogous strategy for non - hermitian matrices .",
    "eigenvalues are complex now , so one has to go beyond the complex plane . using the cayley - dickson construction",
    "we first introduce a second auxiliary complex variable , @xmath39 , to define a quaternion @xmath40 ( see appendix [ aa ] ) and a quaternionic green s function @xmath41 .",
    "once the green s function is determined one can send the second part of the quaternion to zero , @xmath42 , and project it to the complex plane where eigenvalues reside .",
    "this is analogous to sending the imaginary part in the construction of eigenvalue density for hermitian matrices ( [ eq : rhogreens ] ) .",
    "let us discuss this in detail .",
    "we use the notation of quaternions and of quaternionic matrices as in appendix [ aa ] .",
    "we start with the quaternionic representation of the dirac delta on the complex plane @xmath43 where @xmath44 stands for the first cayley - dickson part of quaternion .",
    "it is analogous to the real part @xmath45 of complex number .",
    "this representation is an counterpart of the one - dimensional delta function representation ( [ eq : one - dim_delta ] ) .",
    "the delta function is obtained by calculating the inverse quaternion close to the complex plane and eventually taking the limit by sending the second part of the quaternion to zero .",
    "the difference as compared to eq .",
    "( [ eq : one - dim_delta ] ) is that the imaginary part @xmath46 is replaced by the first part @xmath44 and that there is an additional derivative . in appendix [ ab ]",
    "we explicitly demonstrate that the expression ( [ eq : two - dim_delta ] ) indeed yields a representation of the two - dimensional delta function .",
    "the representation ( [ eq : two - dim_delta ] ) provides us with a guideline as to how to define the quaternionic green s function and how to calculate the eigenvalue distribution from it .",
    "the quaternionic resolvent for a non - hermitian matrix @xmath0 is defined in a similar way as for hermitian matrices ( [ eq : gf ] ) @xcite .",
    "the green s function @xmath41 and its argument @xmath47 are now quaternions @xcite .",
    "denote the first part of the green s function by @xmath48 and the second part by @xmath49 , @xmath50 where @xmath51 .",
    "in analogy to eq .",
    "( [ eq : gf ] ) we have @xmath52 where @xmath53 is quaternionic trace defined in ( [ cdm ] ) . in the pauli matrix representation ( [ pmr ] ) this equation reads @xmath54 in this representation the quaternionic trace @xmath53 is equivalent to taking trace of each of four @xmath55 blocks separately .",
    "the matrix on the right hand side can be inverted @xmath56 where @xmath57 we see that the first part of the quaternionic green s function is @xmath58 and its derivative @xmath59 in the limit of the second part of the quaternion @xmath51 tending to zero , @xmath60 , the expression in the brackets takes the form of a sum of dirac deltas located at the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath0 @xmath61 so the eigenvalue density is regained in this limit similarly as in the one - dimensional case ( [ eq : rhogreens ] ) .",
    "the mechanism of localization of the expression in the brackets ( [ dgx ] ) at eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath0 is analogous to that in the representation ( [ eq : two - dim_delta ] ) of two - dimensional delta function .",
    "the details are given in appendix [ ac ] where we recall the argument given in @xcite .",
    "as in the previous section let us begin by recalling the hermitian case which is well known . it will serve as a reference point .",
    "the @xmath62-expansion of the green s function ( [ eq : gf ] ) generates moments @xmath63 of the random matrix @xmath27  : @xmath64 the r transform is defined by the following equation @xcite @xmath65 the r transform is a generating function for planar connected moments @xmath66 of the matrix @xmath27  : @xmath67 the diagrammatic derivation @xcite of the relation between the green s function and the r transform is presented in appendix d. the connected moments @xmath66 are also known as ",
    "free cumulants  or  non - crossing cumulants  .",
    "they are related to the moments @xmath68 as follows : @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , _",
    "etc_. these relations can be derived by expanding ( [ gf_r ] ) .",
    "note that the first three relations are identical as the corresponding relations between standard cumulants and moments known from classical probability .",
    "the reason why the r transform is important is that it is additive for sums of independent random matrices as discussed in the next section .",
    "now consider a non - hermitian random matrix @xmath0 .",
    "the situation is a bit more complicated since the @xmath73-expansion of the quaternionic green s function ( [ eq : qgf ] ) generates moments of differently ordered powers of the matrix @xmath0 and its hermitian conjugate @xmath1 .",
    "it is convenient to rewrite the resolvent ( [ eq : qgf ] ) as follows @xcite @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 where @xmath34 is the @xmath77 identity matrix and @xmath78 is a matrix representing the quaternion @xmath51 ( [ 2x2 ] ) .",
    "we will index elements of the quaternionic matrix @xmath47 by greek letters @xmath79 and consistently the positions of the blocks @xmath80 in the matrix @xmath81 ( [ calx ] ) and in other block matrices .",

    "( [ eq : qgf_expansion ] ) we arrive at @xmath89 this equation is analogous to eq .",
    "( [ 1z_exp ] ) except that now the moments are given by multidimensional arrays which encode information about all mixed moments . for example @xmath90 .",
    "the first and the second moments are @xmath91 and @xmath92 respectively . generally the array representing the @xmath85-th moment has @xmath93 elements , but not all of them are independent . for example @xmath94 , @xmath95 .",
    "the quaternionic r transform is defined in the same way as the r transform for hermitian matrices ( [ gf_r ] ) @xcite @xmath96 except that it is a quaternionic function .",
    "it generates planar cumulants",

    "in this section we consider the class of gaussian elliptic random matrices which are defined by the condition that the third and higher cumulants vanish : @xmath102 .",
    "the r transform ( [ rk ] ) is a linear function in this case @xmath103 the last equation can be rewritten as a matrix equation @xmath104 where the symbol @xmath105 denotes the hadamard product and @xmath106 , @xmath107 are two - by - two matrices representing the first two cumulants @xmath108 the first cumulant is parametrized by two real parameters : @xmath7 and @xmath8 while the second one by three : @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath9 . the eigenvalue density of the corresponding random matrix is uniform on an ellipse on the complex plane .",

    "we define a family of standardized elliptic laws by setting @xmath112 and @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "all elliptic laws can be obtained from the standardized one by shifting it by @xmath109 , rescaling by a factor @xmath10 and rotating by @xmath9 .",

    "it is the most general form of the gaussian elliptic measure . for any @xmath145",
    "the distribution is uniform on an ellipse .",
    "the limit @xmath146 should be taken carefully . in this limit",
    "the exponent in ( [ mux ] ) changes to a delta function @xmath147 which is responsible for a reduction of the number of degrees of freedom from @xmath138 to @xmath133 .",
    "the width of the ellipse shrinks to zero and the resulting eigenvalue density has a one dimensional support being an interval on the complex plane .",
    "the eigenvalue density is not uniform on this interval but it is given by the wigner semicircle law .",
    "it is worth noting , that those are only two limiting cases , while density experiences an interesting crossover regime when @xmath148 @xcite .",
    "in this section we go beyond the gaussian regime . consider random matrices defined by the following invariant probability measure @xmath149 where @xmath150 is a two - matrix polynomial such that @xmath151 is real and bounded from below .",
    "this means that there exist a real number @xmath152 such that @xmath153 for any matrix @xmath0 .",
    "such measure is invariant w.r.t .",
    "transformation @xmath154 , but such invariance is not sufficient to express the measure only in terms of eigenvalues like in hermitian case .",
    "the left and right eigenvectors are not simply complex conjugates of each other , but their correlations carry an non - trivial information .",
    "the polynomial @xmath150 is constructed as a sum of terms of powers of @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xmath155 with complex coefficients @xmath156 called coupling constants .",
    "different terms may have different coupling constants .",
    "terms which can be obtained from each other by a cyclic permutation of matrices have identical trace and are thus equivalent from the point of view of the measure ( [ muv ] ) .",
    "it is therefore convenient to divide all terms into equivalence classes of products of @xmath0 and @xmath1 which can be obtained from each other by a cyclic permutation .",
    "for example the following products @xmath157 , @xmath158 , @xmath159 belong to the same equivalence class and have the same trace @xmath160 .",

    "we also define dual chains .",
    "a chain is said to be dual to a given chain if it is obtained by swapping positions of @xmath0 s and @xmath1 s in the chain .",
    "the requirement that the trace of the potential is a real number means that the potential @xmath150 must contain pairs of dual terms with complex conjugate coupling constants .",

    "next step is to split the measure into the gaussian part ( [ mux ] ) and to treat the residual part as a perturbation of the gaussian measure @xcite @xmath175 where @xmath176 is the elliptic gaussian measure ( [ mux ] ) and @xmath177 is the remaining part of the potential which contains the third or higher order terms . in this way",
