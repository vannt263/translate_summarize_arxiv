    "the problem of the energy spectrum has still been controversial in two - dimensional turbulence . in three dimensions ,",
    "dimensional analysis by kolmogorov @xcite shows that the energy spectrum in the inertial subrange should be scaled as @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the energy dissipation rate .",
    "kraichnan @xcite , leith @xcite and batchelor @xcite applied kolmogorov theory to the two - dimensional turbulence and obtained that a power of the energy spectrum should be @xmath3 according to existence of the enstrophy cascade in the inviscid limit . on the other hand , saffman @xcite derived the power @xmath4 of the energy spectrum by assuming the jump of constant- vorticity layers .",
    "a possible explanation of these difference is proposed by gilbert @xcite in which spiral structures of vortical region play an important role and may fill the gap between these two spectra .    in many of numerical simulations",
    "@xcite@xcite@xcite of decaying two - dimensional turbulence with the initial gaussian spectrum , the power increases from @xmath4 to @xmath3 , contours of vorticity are stretched and an active enstrophy cascade is observed up to @xmath5 . then coherent vortices emerge with spiral tails and the power of the energy spectrum decreases @xcite .",
    "moreover , a very long - time simulation @xcite shows that in the final stage the flow seems to settle down to the universal `` sinh '' state with the maximum entropy , which is predicted by a statistical argument of the assembly of point vortices @xcite .",
    "analytical closure theories , such as direct interaction approximation ( dia ) and test field model have been also applied to evaluate quantitatively the energy spectrum with its constant and the enstrophy transfer @xcite @xcite in a reasonable comparison with numerical results .",
    "kraichnan @xcite argues that the logarithmic correction can escape from the divergence of the enstrophy integral .",
    "recently , polyakov @xcite @xcite has proposed that one may use the conformal field theory ( cft ) to analyze two dimensional turbulence .",
    "since there appears power law in the correlation functions of velocity fields , for example , the existence of the conformal invariance seems quite natural .",
    "the merit to use cft is that there are well - classified models ( minimal models ) where there appears only finite number of independent operators .",
    "usually , when we try to calculate @xmath6 point functions , we need the knowledge of @xmath7 point functions because of the nonlinearity of the navier - stokes equation .",
    "since we can not usually cope with infinite number of degree of freedom , we need to restrict them to the physically relevant ones from outside , for example , quasi - normal and dia theories .",
    "if the turbulence is described by cft minimal models , such restriction comes from mathematical consistency and there are no arbitrariness . in the original paper ,",
    "polyakov proposed a minimal model ( 21,2 ) as the candidate which may describe turbulence .",
    "this model predicts quite a reasonable value for the exponent .",
    "however , it was indicated later by several groups @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite that polyakov s condition on the cft is not satisfied by unique model , but in fact there are infinite number of candidates . also , as polyakov himself discovered @xcite , there may be some ambiguities in the conditions for cft if one considers the non - vanishing of one point functions in the system with boundaries .",
    "even if one takes the modified conditions , the situation does not change and there are again a lot of cft candidates.@xcite in any case , if one can not find other appropriate conditions , one may not tell which model is more preferable .",
    "one can not even say whether there are several universality classes .",
    "due to appearance of infinite solutions , we can not predict uniquely the exponent of energy spectrum . in such situation , it is difficult to convince ourselves whether prediction from cft is useful as long as we consider only one observable .",
    "one way to proceed in this situation is to consider the global ( or geometrical ) aspect of the conformal turbulence.@xcite in this paper , we would like consider another direction . in cft models , there appear a lot of primary fields beside the original velocity field .",
    "it is quite important consider the physical meaning of these fields .",
    "some of them can be obtained in the short distance expansion of the velocity field .",
    "thus we can relate it to the the dependence of three or four point functions on the reynolds number which is known as the  skewness \" or  flatness \" .",
    "if the assumption of the local equilibrium is correct , they should be some universal constants .",
    "however , in cft , we get nontrivial dependence on reynolds number due to the anomalous dimension . in three - dimensional turbulence",
    ", there is a tendency that both skewness and flatness of velocity derivatives increases as reynolds number becomes large @xcite . in many of cft solutions ,",
    "however , the behavior is the opposite to these three - dimensional observations .    interestingly ,",
    "as we prove in this paper , these exponents are not independent with each other but can be uniquely determined from the exponent of energy spectrum .",
    "this property is tightly related to the finiteness of minimal models .",
    "intuitively , in order to calculate the higher correlation functions , the most dominant contribution comes from the lowest dimension operator in the ope .",
    "however , in the minimal models , there are always lower bound in the dimensions of primary fields .",
    "we surveyed more than 1600 candidates of cft solutions . in 99% of them ,",
    "the lowest dimension is attained in the first ope between @xmath8 .",
    "the other 1% behaves quite differently but we show that they can be determined exactly .    as another peculiar character ,",
    "two - dimensional inviscid flows possess infinite number of conserved quantities @xmath9 which are topological invariants of area - preserving diffeomorphism , called casimir .",
    "it is commonly believed that these conservation laws may affect the character of the two - dimensional turbulence , i.e. ergordicity , energy spectrum and so on , although the effects are not fully understood .",
    "a finite - mode system of two - dimensional euler flow preserving such conservation laws is derived by zeitlin@xcite . however , the effect of this conservation laws on the behavior of turbulent states is still unresolved .",
    "using cft theories , falkovich and hanany@xcite showed that the dependence of the dissipation rate of @xmath9 on the viscosity @xmath10 can be predicted .",
    "we extend their results and compare the prediction with the numerical results .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we review the classical theories of two - dimensional turbulence .",
    "it is shown that the extended theory , which contains both the kraichnan - leith - batchelor s and saffman s theories , is useful in order to understand the conformal turbulence . in section 3",
    "polyakov s conformal turbulence is reviewed with a brief sketch of conformal field theory .",
    "the original cft models are generalized so that the imposed constraint includes not only the kraichnan s constant transfer of enstrophy but also the non - cascade theory by saffman . in section 4 solutions of this generalized cft models of two - dimensional turbulence are shown .",
    "distributions of the energy spectra are revealed , a relation between the central charge in cft and the power of the energy spectrum is described . in section 5 higher order statistics including",
    "skewness and flatness factors are derived .",
    "scaling of casimir invariant @xmath11 and its decay rate are discussed in section 6 .",
    "these predictions are compared with the numerical simulations in section 7 .",
    "conclusions and discussions are summarized in section 8 . throughout this",
    "paper , attention is paid on removal of the gap between the field theory and fluid communities .",
    "we shall review standard theories of two - dimensional turbulence in order to understand the conformal theory of it . in what follows",
    "we mainly keep in mind the decaying turbulence , i.e. the system with no external forcing .",
    "the equations governing the two - dimensional incompressible viscous flow are    @xmath12    @xmath13    the vorticity equation is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the streamfunction , @xmath16 is the vorticity , and the jacobian @xmath17 is defined by @xmath18 from ( [ t1 ] ) and ( [ t3 ] ) , the evolution of total energy @xmath19 and square - vorticity , called enstrophy @xmath20 , is given by @xmath21 @xmath22 because the enstrophy decreases monotonically , the energy dissipation rate @xmath23 vanishes in the inviscid limit @xmath24 .",
    "thus the stationary energy cascade is irrelevant in decaying two - dimensional turbulence , although in the forced system , the energy is transferred to the low wavenumber side , called the inverse cascade .    in kraichnan - leith - batchelor theory , the turbulence is characterized by the cascade of enstrophy .",
    "the dimensional analysis shows the energy spectrum is expressed as @xmath25 in the inertial subrange @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the enstrophy dissipation rate , @xmath28 is a universal constant , @xmath29 denotes the large scale length which may be considered as the size of the largest eddy of coherent structures or the boundary condition , and @xmath30 implies the dissipation scale given by @xmath31 the total energy estimated by the integral in the inertial range leads to @xmath32 on the other hand @xmath29 may be evaluated by @xmath33 and @xmath34 as @xmath35 from ( [ t9 ] ) and ( [ t10 ] ) we may obtain the reynolds number as @xmath36 in this theory @xmath27 and @xmath10 are considered as independent and it is allowed that @xmath27 remains finite in the inviscid limit .",
    "saffman considered that , in the context of decaying two - dimensional turbulence , the discontinuity of the vorticity is the asymptotic feature by extending the argument of one - dimensional turbulence , i.e. burgers equation .",
    "the energy spectrum may be given by @xmath37 and the dissipation length is given by @xmath38 the enstrophy dissipation rate is estimated as @xmath39 using @xmath40 and @xmath33 remains constant in the inviscid limit , ( [ t14 ] ) is rewritten as @xmath41 thus @xmath27 depends on @xmath10 as @xmath42 . by saffman s picture there is no enstrophy cascade in the inviscid limit .",
    "reynolds number is given by @xmath43    comparing the energy spectra and the dissipation lengths of the two theories , it seems quite useful to develop a following extended theory .",
    "that is , the energy spectrum in the inertial range is given by @xmath44 and the dissipation scale is expressed as @xmath45 where parameters @xmath46 and @xmath47 are introduced in order to bridge over the two standard theories .",
    "this generalization is also important when we consider cft turbulence described in the following section .    from ( [ t18 ] ) ,",
    "the reynolds number is estimated as @xmath48 the enstrophy dissipation rate @xmath27 is estimated as @xmath49 substituting ( [ t18 ] ) into ( [ t20 ] ) the dependence of @xmath27 on @xmath50 is expressed as @xmath51 where @xmath52 . using ( [ t10 ] ) @xmath27 is expressed by @xmath53 and @xmath33 as @xmath54 moreover , the restrictions @xmath55 may be imposed if this extension should meet both the enstrophy cascade theory and saffman s spectrum .",
    "a more physical argument , which reconcile the two theories similarly to our idea , is made by gilbert @xcite , who showed that the energy spectra with powers between @xmath3 and @xmath4 can be derived by considering that the isolated strong vortex cores wind up the discontinuous lines of the vorticity .",
    "this spiral model gives the energy spectrum in the inertial subrange as @xmath56 where @xmath57 denotes the strength of the vortex and the parameter @xmath58 specifies the distribution of the vorticity in the core .",
    "the value of @xmath58 is allowed as @xmath59 , @xmath60 implies the saffman s power @xmath4 , @xmath61 gives the klb values @xmath3 and the index of the realistic vortex is approximately 2 ( the value of the point vortex ) , which gives the power @xmath62 .    in the case of decaying turbulence , the temporal behavior of @xmath34 can be obtained by integrating ( [ t22 ] ) assuming that @xmath33 is nearly constant : @xmath63^{\\fr{2}{\\ga-2 } } .",

    "we are also interested in the behavior of the infinite number of inviscid invariants , i.e. , arbitrary powers of vorticity , in the limit @xmath71 .",
    "the decay rate of @xmath72 is given by @xmath73    it is difficult to get the dependence of @xmath74 on @xmath34 and @xmath75 , but if we assume a random phase distribution of the fourier coefficients of @xmath76 , we get the dependence as @xmath77 for an even @xmath6 and @xmath78 for an odd @xmath6 . from ( [ t26]),([t27 ] ) and ( [ t29 ] ) , @xmath79 decays as @xmath80 }   { \\ga-2 } } t^{\\fr{n+2-\\ga } { \\ga-2 } } . \\label{t30}\\ ] ] the pair @xmath81 gives @xmath82 and @xmath83 leads to @xmath84 thus the dissipation rate of @xmath85 is independent of viscosity by the enstrophy cascade theory and increases as @xmath10 tends to zero by saffman s picture in the random phase approximation .",
    "in order to make smooth communication between fluid dynamics and elementary particle community , we would like give a short sketch of some basics of cft .",
    "the material is quite standard .",
    "see the original paper to understand the detail@xcite .",
    "also there are many nice review articles , for example , see @xcite .    in quantum field theory",
    ", symmetry generally plays an important role . on the one hand symmetry",
    "implies existence of conservation law and resulting in effective reduction of the degrees of freedom . on the other hand ,",
    "symmetry is a useful tool to select out nicely behaving class of field theories among vast amount of all the possible field theories .",
    "the most successful example of such is the class of two dimensional conformal field theories ( cft ) .",
    "the field theory in the class is defined in two dimension , and has the conformal invariance as its symmetry .",
    "this means , if we use a complex variable @xmath86 , dynamics of theory is invariant under an complex analytic transformation @xmath87 .",
    "polyakov et al .",
    "@xcite performed a systematic study of cft and showed that the conformal symmetry is really powerful to classify possible cfts and solve them .",
    "physically , cft concerns the critical point of the second order phase transition of statistical systems . on the critical point , we are faced with the situation that the correlation length of the operators in the system grows up to infinity . in this limit , the system gains the conformal invariance . then the two dimensional system is described by cfts .    especially in two dimensions",
    ", it is known that the conformal symmetry becomes infinite dimensional and generated by the operators @xmath88 and @xmath89 @xmath90 .",
    "they form a lie algebra : @xmath91 which is called virasoro algebra .",
    "the last term in the rhs comes from quantum anomaly .",
    "important fact is that we have a detailed understanding of its representations theory , and he knowledge is really helpful in classifying all the possible cfts .",
    "representation theory is quite different whether @xmath92 or @xmath93 . in the former case ,",
    "the classification of the possible theories is not completely done with virasoro algebra alone , we need further informations such as the extended symmetry to classify and solve the system .",
    "conversely , in the latter case , the virasoro algebra is strong enough to completely classify all the possible theories and to solve the system completely .",
    "in fact , it was shown that the central charge is restricted to take only the discrete values , @xmath94 with @xmath95 mutually coprime integers .",
    "these models are so - called minimal models .    in cft , we have two kinds of fields called primary fields and secondary fields .",
    "the former is covariant under the conformal transform , @xmath96 while the latter is not . for each primary field , there are infinite number of secondary fields .",
    "those can be obtained from the primary field through the action of the virasoro generators .",
    "derivative of the primary field is a typical secondary field .",
    "one of the most important properties of the minimal model is that the number of primary fields is finite . for the minimal model characterized by @xmath97 ,",
    "the conformal dimensions @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) of primary fields are restricted to take the following discrete values , @xmath100 the final restriction @xmath101 comes from the fact that we can identify primary field with label @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "this set of primary fields is called the kac table",
    ".    it may be intuitive to compare the representation of the virasoro algebra with that of @xmath104 algebra .",
    "algebra which correspond to the central charge of the virasoro algebra .",
    "this term originates from the infinite dimensionality of the algebra .",
    "] the primary field described above corresponds to the highest weight state in the @xmath104 representation .",
    "the states generated from highest weight state by the action of lowering operator should be compared to the secondary field .",
    "finally , corresponding to the composition rule of the angular momenta , two primary fields are composed to give several other primary fields .",
    "namely the primary fields form an algebra by the composition operation .",
    "the composition rule is called fusion algebra or operator product expansion , ope .",
    "the rule can be deduced from the representation theory just like the computation of the clebsh - gordan coefficients of @xmath104 representation . for the virasoro algebra ,",
    "the ope is explicitly given by , @xmath105 where @xmath106 denotes the primary field whose conformal dimension is @xmath107 .",
    "the symbol @xmath108 denotes the conformal family ( the primary field and its associated secondary fields ) .",
    "if we regard ( [ fusion ] ) as the short distance expansion , the contribution from the secondary fields are higher order in power of @xmath109 compared to those coming from the primary field , so they are irrelevant .",
    "finally , let us see some examples of cft .",
    "the minimal models are not necessarily unitary . in other words",
    ", negative norm state appears in some situations .",
    "only if @xmath110 with @xmath111 , the theory is unitary .",
    "many of the critical points of the known 2-dim statistical systems are described by the models in this series .",
    "for example , the ising model ( @xmath112 , i.e. @xmath113 ) the tri - critical ising model ( @xmath114 , i.e. @xmath115 ) , the three state potts model ( @xmath116 , i.e. @xmath117 ) , and so on . for these models",
    ", one can find the physical interpretation for the primary fields .",
    "for example , for ising model , we have three independent primary operators , @xmath118 these operators may be identified with , identity operator , energy density and the spin field respectively .    on the other hand ,",
    "the nonunitary models are by no means physical , but contains some very interesting models , such as yang - lee edge singularity ( @xmath119 , i.e. @xmath120 ) .",
    "they are characterized by the appearance of the negative dimension operators . for the yang - lee edge singularity case",
    ", we have @xmath121 . in the unitary case ,",
    "the lowest dimension operator in the system is always the vacuum , which is represented by the primary field with @xmath122 .",
    "for the non - unitary case , this vacuum is no longer the lowest dimension operator but rather we have a primary field with dimension , @xmath123 this operator may be regarded as the true vacuum of the system .",
    "let us take a nonunitary model @xmath124 as an example .",
    "field content consists of ten fields : @xmath125 .",
    "since the second index @xmath58 is always unity in this case , we will omit it hereafter .",
    "ope is , for example @xmath126 for the two point function , this fusion rule implies that @xmath127 note that @xmath128 dependence of each term in rhs is determined by the accordance of the length dimension in both sides .        in cft approach to two dimensional turbulence",
    ", the fluid circulation function @xmath129 is supposed to be described by a primary field of a minimal model of cft .",
    "@xmath129 is related to the velocity field through @xmath130 .",
    "polyakov s conditions for cft to describe turbulence are following ,    1 .",
    "hopf equation should be satisfied , @xmath131 2",
    ".   constant flow of enstrophy in the momentum .    assuming operator product expansion ( ope ) , @xmath132}{\\left [ \\psi\\right]}\\sim { \\left [ \\phi\\right]}+\\cdots ,      \\label{2}\\ ] ] where @xmath133 is the smallest dimension primary field in ope , the nonlinear term in the navier - stokes equation ( [ 1 ] ) is equivalent to @xmath134 where @xmath135 is a viscous cutoff length .",
    "vanishing of this quantity then produces either @xmath136 or @xmath137 the second equation ( which is equivalent to that @xmath133 is ( 2,1 ) type primary field ) is not compatible with the conditions on enstrophy and polyakov has picked up the first condition .",
    "the constant enstrophy flow constraint is more subtle .",
    "the time derivative of the enstrophy gives @xmath138 with @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "rewriting the right hand side of ( [ 4 ] ) as the integral in the momentum space , the constant enstrophy condition is equivalent to @xmath141 naive dimensional counting shows that it is equivalent to @xmath142 .",
    "however , we have to be careful to the contribution of the one point function , which is non - vanishing in the general topology of two dimensional space .",
    "the dependence of one point function on the characteristic length of the system is @xmath143 for any primary field @xmath129 .",
    "for unitary theory where dimension of any primary field is positive , one point function is not relevant in the large @xmath29 limit .",
    "however , since we are discussing on the system where dissipation takes place , we are dealing with non - unitary theory where negative dimensional operator appears .",
    "in this situation , the lowest dimension operator becomes most relevant one .",
    "if we denote @xmath144 as the lowest dimension primary field in ope @xmath145}{\\left [ \\phi\\right]}$ ] , then the correct condition for the constant enstrophy flow is @xmath146    the solutions of cft that satisfy ( [ 3.5 ] ) and ( [ 7 ] ) was discussed by chung et .",
    "al.@xcite and they found several hundreds candidates .",
    "once we know that there are solutions , the next step is how to extract physical exponents out of them .",
    "the most important one is discussed by polyakov , i.e. the exponent of energy spectrum , which may be described by , @xmath147 from contribution of the one - point function ( [ 6 ] ) , one finds that @xmath148 if the one - point correlation integral vanishes , the energy spectrum becomes @xmath149 these expressions are fourier transform of two - point functions , @xmath150 for correlation function on sphere @xcite and @xmath151 for correlation function on general topology riemann surface including torus .",
    "this kind of correlation functions was discussed previously by j. cardy @xcite which is the refinement of the discussion given by fisher @xcite .",
    "the correlation function of unitary model ( in particular , ising model ) on the torus was obtained explicitly by di francesco et .",
    "al.@xcite . in the turbulence context ,",
    "some of the physical implication was discussed by polyakov@xcite and chung et.al .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "the most important observation is that we can not neglect the contribution of the one point function .",
    "this is because the dimension of @xmath133 is negative and it becomes dominant in the large @xmath29 limit in ( [ torus ] ) .",
    "let us introduce the other possibilities that can be imposed on the conformal field theory .",
    "as we saw in section 2 , there are many variants of the two - dimensional turbulence models where the enstrophy flow may depends on the viscosity .",
    "also , the condition will be changed if one have vanishing one point function which was originally considered by polyakov . to get the corresponding object in the conformal turbulence",
    ", we need to compare the dissipation calculated by the viscosity term and nonlinear term in the navier - stokes equation .",

    ", @xmath157 by employing these relations , one may obtain the dependence of @xmath27 on the viscosity as @xmath158 if we use the vanishing one - point function condition , @xmath159 should be replaced by , @xmath160 in either case , if we employ the kraichnan - leith - batchelor type condition , one has to impose , @xmath161 and if we use saffman type condition , we get , @xmath162    on the other hand , the parameter @xmath163 defined in ( [ t19 ] ) may be expressed by the conformal dimensions as @xmath164 by comparing with ( [ gc5]-[gc6 ] ) . in this way , one can relate the dimensions of cft primary fields with all the parameters which appeared in the previous section .",
    "in order to compute concrete values for the critical exponents , we need to solve ( generalized ) polyakov s conditions ( [ gc7 ] ) or ( [ gc8 ] ) explicitly .",
    "this program is rather hard to be carried out analytically , hence , we have only solutions obtained from numerical computation .",
    "previously , some of the cft models of klb type was found by @xcite for vanishing one - point function case and by @xcite for non - vanishing one point function case . in those papers , although cft models are derived , the characteristic features which are common for those models are not discussed . in this paper , we study more extensive study for the generalized conditions ( [ gc7 ] ) or ( [ gc8 ] ) to get insights on the generic features of models which meet these conditions .",
    "we surveyed generalized diofantian equations ( [ gc9 ] ) ( [ gc10 ] ) ( we shall call them as p@xmath165 , and s@xmath165 ( with @xmath166 ) in the following ) up to @xmath167 and @xmath168 . as expected we got many cft candidates , 1658 models for condition p1 , 78 models for condition p2 , 67 models for condition s1 and 75 models for condition s2 .",
    "later we prove that there are infinite number of solutions for any conditions of type ( [ gc7 ] ) .",
    "since we have several cft models , we can not determine the exponents in the two dimensional turbulence uniquely . in figure 1a - d",
    ", we show the histogram of number of cft models against the exponent of energy spectrum or each of the conditions . where as in figure 1b,1d , we have rather flat spectrum in the range @xmath169 , we have broader ( @xmath170 ) and localized spectrum ( peak located around @xmath171 ) for the modified condition .",
    "we can also notice that a significant portion ( 82% ) of the cft models has their exponent in the range @xmath172 .",
    "we remark that in the course of computation , we need to determine operator @xmath133 as the lowest dimension operator in the ope @xmath8 . by this process",
    ", we can classify the obtained models into two groups .",
    "the first group , which we call category a below , is characterized by the fact that @xmath133 has already the dimension very close to the lowest dimension @xmath173 of the system . in this case , the dimension of @xmath144 is very close to @xmath133 since both of them are roughly same as @xmath173 . the situation remains same even if we take higher opes .",
    "most of the solutions which we obtained belong to this category .    on the other hand , in the second class of solutions ( category b ) , neither @xmath133 nor @xmath144 have dimension closer to @xmath173 . in this case , in every step we take ope , we meet lower dimensional operator . since category b is simpler and can be classified completely , we start with it first .",
    "the most interesting feature of solutions of this class is that we can find an infinite number of solutions for the condition of type ( [ c7 ] ) for _ any fractional _ @xmath174 .",
    "as far as we have observed , the solutions of those type always take the following form , i.e. @xmath175 it is obvious from ( [ fusion ] ) that there appears only primary fields of type @xmath176 in the ope of primary fields with index @xmath60 . on the other hand ,",
    "the conformal dimension of fields @xmath176 decreases as @xmath177 increases as long as @xmath178 .",
    "one may confirm that @xmath133 is the minimum dimension in ope @xmath8 and so is @xmath144 in ope @xmath179 if @xmath180 also , for sufficiently large @xmath6 , one may easily convince oneself that neither @xmath133 nor @xmath144 have dimension closer to the minimum dimension of the system .    now",
    "if we put those combinations into ( [ c7 ] ) , we get , @xmath181 the right hand side does not depend on @xmath6 . for any fractional value for @xmath174 , we can adjust @xmath182 and @xmath183 such that ( [ b2 ] ) can be satisfied .",
    "for example , to achieve klb type condition @xmath184 , one may put @xmath185 for saffman type condition @xmath186 , one may get , @xmath187 these give the solutions to the diofantian equation for @xmath188 in klb case and for @xmath189 for saffman case .",
    "this simple observation shows that there are infinite number of solutions for the condition ( [ c7 ] ) for any @xmath174 .",
    "one of the interesting feature of these solutions is that all of these models have same energy spectrum for each @xmath174 .",
    "indeed , one may derive another cancellation of @xmath6 , @xmath190 one can remove @xmath182 and @xmath183 from relations ( [ b2 ] ) and ( [ b5 ] ) , @xmath191 the parameter @xmath163 , on the other hand , can be similarly determined by , @xmath192    for klb , one has @xmath193 and for saffman type condition , one has @xmath194 .",
    "the latter model seems to fit rather well to the observed value for the energy spectrum @xmath195 .",
    "although cft models in category b has rather interesting properties , the majority ( 99% ) of the solutions we obtained belong to this category .",
    "although we can not solve the diofantian equation in general , we can make several observations for this class .",
    "interestingly , the various exponents of the models in this class is ( although approximately ) related to the central charge of the system .",
    "the dependence itself is different for the conditions that we impose on the conformal models .",
    "if there are some methods where we can independently measure the central charge , one may judge which condition is the appropriate one .    in order to derive such formulae , it is essential to observe that    1 .",
    "the operator product expansion of @xmath129 field gives rise to a operator @xmath133 whose dimension is very close to the lowest dimension ( @xmath196 ) of the system .",
    "the central charge of the nonunitary minimal model is linearly related to @xmath196 .    to demonstrate the first fact",
    ", we make histograms of the difference of the conformal dimensions between field @xmath133 and @xmath196 ( figure 2 ) .",
    "we can see that deviation is less than 0.02 . the second fact can be easily checked by recalling that @xmath197 and @xmath198 .",
    "when @xmath199 or @xmath183 is sufficiently large , the first term in the denominator of @xmath196 may be neglected and one finds , @xmath200    if we use the generalized condition ( [ gc7 ] ) , we get @xmath201 the energy exponent may be then given by , @xmath202 in particular , @xmath203    similarly , the viscous scale index @xmath47 in ( [ t18 ] ) can be obtained as @xmath204 for the condition ( [ c7 ] ) . from the klb and saffman s condition , @xmath47 reduces to @xmath205 together with ( [ c1 ] ) , it is clear that ( [ c13 ] ) gives the linear relation for the energy exponent and the central charge .",
    "we plot those relation in figure 3 , to show that these are fulfilled rather nicely .",
    "although the solutions of category a seem to occur randomly , there are several models that can be classified into several families of solutions .",
    "we would like to explain it by using the examples of condition p1 .",
    "first of all , as chung et .",
    "al . has already pointed out , there are many occurrences of solutions ( in our case , 1347 cases out of 1658 ) , with special combination of primary fields , @xmath206 we would like to prove that this combination becomes the solution of conformal turbulence whenever @xmath207 with @xmath199 and @xmath183 coprime . roughly speaking",
    ", this shows that there are @xmath183 solutions of this type for each @xmath183 .",
    "this fact explains quite systematic occurrence of solutions of this type .",
    "the proof is quite elementary",
    ". we must first observe ( [ 21 ] ) solves ( [ 7 ] ) for arbitrary @xmath199 and @xmath183 .",
    "this requirement is equivalent to the algebraic equation @xmath208 if @xmath129 , @xmath133 , @xmath144 are labeled @xmath209 , @xmath210 , and @xmath211 .    the next step is to study when @xmath133 described in ( [ 21 ] ) becomes the lowest dimension operator in ope . by explicitly comparing the dimension of @xmath133 with its neighbors , @xmath212 , @xmath213 , @xmath214 , @xmath215 , @xmath216 ,",
    "one finds that ( [ 22 ] ) is the desired condition . under this condition , one can easily show that @xmath217 is indeed the lowest dimension operator in ope @xmath179 .",
    "( qed )    for this family of solutions , since the ratio of @xmath199 and @xmath183 is already given ( [ 22 ] ) , one can determine the range of the exponents .",
    "for example , the range of @xmath218 is immediately determined by using @xmath219 , @xmath220 since @xmath199 can take arbitrary ( of course , with coprime condition ) integer value in ( [ 22 ] ) , the distribution in this range is quite flat .",
    "this fact is quite consistent with figure 1a .",
    "there are two other families of solutions with similar property , i.e. they satisfy ( [ 23 ] ) .",
    "the first one is , @xmath221 and the second one is , @xmath222 there are 54 occurrence of the first family and 2 occurrence of the second one .",
    "one can similarly show that they contain infinite solutions as their member .",
    "the expected range of @xmath218 is given by @xmath223 respectively .",
    "although 1418 of 1658 solutions are explainable in this way , there are still 240 solutions that we can not describe their origin .",
    "however , we may give some phenomenological reasoning why there appear peaks around @xmath224 , @xmath225 , @xmath226,@xmath227 , and @xmath228 .",
    "as it turns out , those peaks comes from the models where @xmath133 happen to be @xmath213 , @xmath229 , @xmath230 , @xmath231 and @xmath232.5 comes from models with @xmath233 . ] in order that those operators are roughly the lowest dimension fields , the ratio of @xmath234 should be 17,19,21,23,25 respectively . putting these values in ( [ c13 ] ) , we get , @xmath235 respectively . of these classification , there are 180 models . to summarize , although cft gives infinite number of solutions for polyakov s criterion , we can extract quite a lot information from them .",
    "especially , we can determine the relations between the exponents and have several models which have their @xmath218 in the special range .",
    "as we saw in the previous sections , the primary fields @xmath129 , @xmath236 are related to the observable in two dimensional turbulence through the energy exponent .",
    "now some natural question arises . in general",
    ", there are many other primary fields in the minimal models .",
    "how can we extract some informations for those fields ? here",
    "we propose that one direction we may take is to go further to calculate higher correlation functions . as long as the assumption of the local equilibrium is correct , if one makes the dimensionless combination such as , @xmath237 , it should be a dimensionless constant and there should be no dependence on the reynolds number . in cft , this is not true because there are singularities in the short distance expansion .    in the correlation function , @xmath238 ,",
    "the dominant contribution comes from the one point function of the lowest dimension in the ope @xmath145}\\times{\\left [ \\psi\\right]}\\cdots { \\left [ \\psi\\right]}$ ] .",
    "this gives the @xmath29 dependence of the correlation function . on the other hand ,",
    "the singularity coming from the short distance expansion of @xmath129 fields can be expressed as power of the short distance cutoff @xmath153 .",
    "let us denote @xmath239 as the lowest dimension operator in the @xmath6th order product and @xmath240 as the dimension of @xmath239 .",
    "we may evaluate the @xmath6 point function in terms of them , @xmath241 it follows that the non - trivial dependence on @xmath153 for the dimensionless combination , @xmath242 here @xmath243 is the exponent for @xmath6th order products : @xmath244 the simplest choice @xmath245 and @xmath246 corresponds to what is usually called  skewness \" and  flatness \" in the fluid dynamics community .",
    "we shall denote the exponents for @xmath247 as @xmath248 and @xmath249 in the following discussions .",
    "for this category , one may substitute @xmath250 in ( [ sk3 ] ) . using ( [ c19 ] ) , one obtains @xmath251      skewness and flatness may be computed by using , @xmath252 and @xmath253 , which is valid for @xmath254 .",
    "amazingly , even the dependence on parameter @xmath174 disappears .",
    "@xmath255 in general , if the minimum dimension operator in @xmath256th product of @xmath129 is given by @xmath257 , the @xmath256th exponent is @xmath258 in this way , we find that the solutions for category b gives _ unique _ prediction for the higher exponents .",
    "up to now , cft is supposed to describe the time independent aspect of the two dimensional turbulence .",
    "however , the use of navier - stokes equation gives a simple explanation time dependence for the decaying turbulence behaves as the morse function in the theory space of cft and increases its value in the process of renormalization group . in order to apply his argument to turbulence , we need to extend his argument to include the non - unitary theory .",
    "we would like to discuss this aspect in future issues . ] .",
    "in particular , we would like to discuss the decay rate of casimir invariants @xmath259 in detail to compare the results from cft to our numerical computation .",
    "one may easily find it as , @xmath260 as usual , @xmath261 is the minimum dimension in the ope of @xmath6 @xmath129 fields . on the other hand , a dimensional argument shows @xmath262 where @xmath263 denotes an anomalous dimension for @xmath74 . comparing ( [ ca1 ] ) and ( [ ca2 ] )",
    ", we find @xmath264 using ( [ t10 ] ) , ( [ t18 ] ) and ( [ ca3 ] ) , ( [ ca2 ] ) becomes @xmath265 substituting ( [ t26 ] ) into ( [ ca4 ] ) , we can estimate the decay rate of @xmath259 as @xmath266 where the powers @xmath267 and @xmath268 can be obtained as @xmath269    on the other hand , the random phase approximation described in section 2 leads to @xmath270 @xmath271 we can see that this difference originates in the anomalous dimension .      using ( [ ca6 ] ) , ( [ c11 ] ) and ( [ c17 ] )",
    ", the exponents @xmath267 , @xmath268 of decay rate can be obtained as @xmath272 they become @xmath273 for the klb condition and @xmath274 for the saffman condition .",
    "the decay rate for the higher casimir invariant can be found from ( [ b7 ] ) .",
    "after some computation , we get @xmath275 unlike category a , these exponents grows as @xmath276 .",
    "they become @xmath277 for the klb condition and , @xmath278 for the saffman condition .",
    "in this section , some statistical properties predicted by cft are compared with the numerical data obtained by the direct simulation .",
    "the pseudospectral method is used , which efficiently computes convolutions of the nonlinear terms in the physical space and is fully dealiased by the two - third law .",
    "the modes are 256@xmath279256 , the time integration is performed by the second - order runge - kutta scheme up to @xmath280 and the width for time step is 0.002 .",
    "we examined five different cases of viscosity , @xmath10 = 0.0001 , 0.0003 , 0.001 , 0.003 and 0.01 and main results for the first four cases are shown .",
    "decaying turbulence created by ( [ t1 ] ) without external forcing is investigated .",
    "temporal evolution of energy @xmath33 , enstrophy @xmath34 and enstrophy dissipation rate @xmath27 is shown in figures 4a - c .",
    "initial increase of @xmath27 is observed until @xmath281 for @xmath282 and the decay of @xmath34 and @xmath27 is prominent after @xmath283 .",
    "thus , data in the time interval @xmath284 are used to fit the asymptotic behavior of @xmath27 : @xmath285 where @xmath64 in ( [ t27 ] ) is replaced by @xmath286 in order to get a more precise power from the finite - time integration .",
    "the time offset @xmath287 is estimated by the asymptotic expression of @xmath288 , which is independent of @xmath183 and the data @xmath289 . numerically obtained values of parameters in ( [ n1 ] ) are shown in table 2 .",
    "although the numerical power of @xmath64 varies from @xmath4 to @xmath290 according to @xmath10 , it is nearly constant when @xmath291 , which is obtained by the proper resolution and closer to that of saffman than that of batchelor .",
    "( see the energy spectrum in figure 4d ) the power @xmath199 is obtained as @xmath292 by the two cases @xmath293 and the energy averaged in the time interval @xmath284 , which is close to but slightly larger than saffman s value @xmath294 . comparing ( [ n1 ] ) with ( [ t27 ] ) , relations between @xmath295 and @xmath296 are obtained as @xmath297 @xmath298 although @xmath296 varies from 0.333 to 1.333 from the numerical data of @xmath183 , the plausible value of @xmath299 leads to @xmath300 or 0.557 . from ( [ t22 ] ) we obtain @xmath301 and the power lies between 0.386 to 0.443 .",
    "the obtained power locates between the klb value 0 and the saffman s value 2/3 .",
    "the temporal evolution of the inviscid invariant @xmath259 and its dissipation rate @xmath74 is examined and shown in figures 5a , b for @xmath302 and even @xmath6 between 4 and 20 . for odd @xmath6 ,",
    "@xmath259 oscillates irregularly around zero and no clear dependence on @xmath10 or @xmath6 is observed .",
    "the adopted numerical method does not conserve @xmath259 even if @xmath303 because of truncation in the fourier space , although energy and enstrophy are conserved . in fact , oscillations appear in @xmath259 in the case of the smallest viscosity and large @xmath6 . however , we analyze the data of @xmath74 since the deviation is not monotonic and the decay dominates the oscillation for the most cases .",
    "similar to the @xmath75 , the following asymptotic form of @xmath304 for even @xmath6 is assumed : @xmath305 figure 3a shows the powers @xmath306 versus @xmath6 for the four cases . if there is an @xmath6 dependence of @xmath306 predicted by conformal field theory like @xmath307 we may estimate them by the data shown in figure 7 .",
    "table 3 shows estimated values of @xmath308 and @xmath309 .",
    "constants @xmath308 are within the values of ( [ ca8 ] ) or ( [ ca9 ] ) predicted by category a. however , for @xmath309 , numerical values are smaller than theoretical ones .",
    "the other parameter @xmath267 , denoted by @xmath310 is also estimated by plotting @xmath311 where @xmath312 is @xmath313 .",
    "we find negative values , between -0.422 and -0.265 , of @xmath314 and , between -0.0145 and -0.00525 , of @xmath182 the latter is very small .",
    "since the constants @xmath312 include a constant proportional to @xmath276 , the degree of coincidence is unsatisfactory .    for skewness and flatness , we should determine what kind of variables is to be measured .",
    "we choose @xmath315 and @xmath316 since they show rapid growth in the initial stage @xmath317 .",
    "the former is related with production of palinstrophy . in figure 7a , b maxima of @xmath318 and @xmath319 versus @xmath10 at the initial increase are plotted . we observe that both @xmath318 and @xmath319 increases as @xmath10 decreases , as is observed in many experiments of three - dimensional turbulence @xcite .",
    "intermittency of turbulence is responsible for the tendency that skewness and flatness increase as reynolds number becomes large .",
    "we observe that @xmath320 and @xmath321 . on the other hand ,",
    "the predicted feature for @xmath318 and @xmath319 is the opposite , i.e. , the decreases as reynolds number increases .",
    "actually this prediction contradicts with observations so far .",
    "since the behaviour of higher order statistics is strongly dependent on what is the measured physical quantity , there may exist observables faithful to the present prediction .",
    "it is shown that the extended theory of two - dimensional turbulence characterized by the energy exponent and the viscous scale index can clarify relations between classical and conformal field theories .",
    "new classes of cft solutions for two - dimensional turbulence are obtained and its statistical predictions are explored .",
