    "over a dozen bl lacs have been detected at gev energies @xcite , but only a few nearby bl lacs have been identified at tev energies so far .",
    "mkn 421 ( @xmath5 ) @xcite and mkn501 ( @xmath6 ) @xcite are now strongly confirmed sources , seen by more than one ground - based atmospheric erenkov telescope ( act ) at or above the @xmath7 level .",
    "two more , 1es 2344 + 514 ( z=@xmath8 ) @xcite and pks 2155 - 304 ( @xmath9 ) @xcite , have been detected only once and are less conclusive .",
    "this strongly suggests that low - redshift x  ray selected bl lac objects ( xbls ) such as these may be the only extragalactic @xmath10-ray sources observable at tev energies .",
    "this is because on the one hand more distant objects would have their tev emission strongly absorbed by the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) , and on the other bright x  ray emission , presumably originating from synchrotron radiation and thus revealing the distribution of radiating particles , implies even higher intrinsic gev - tev emission ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the bl lac object 1es1959@xmath165  ( @xmath11 ) , is an xbl also present in the third egret catalog with an average measured flux of @xmath12 photons @xmath13 for @xmath14 mev @xcite .",
    "it is thus a natural source for tev emission , and @xcite , using simple scaling arguments , have predicted for it the third highest flux above 0.3 and 1 tev , after mkn 421 and mkn 501 .",
    "more recently , @xcite have also pointed it out as a candidate tev emitter . quoting @xcite ,",
    "the utah seven telescope array has reported the detection of 1es1959@xmath165   based on 57 hours of observation in 1998 @xcite , with an energy threshold of 600 gev .",
    "the flux level was not reported but the total signal was at the 3.9 @xmath15 level .",
    "this is not normally considered sufficient to claim the detection of a new source ; however , within this database there were two epochs which were selected _ a posteriori _ which gave signals above the canonical @xmath16 level .",
    "this source has not yet been confirmed by any other group ; it was observed by the whipple group but no flux was detected @xcite .",
    "of particular interest in this source is also the fact that its distance is of the same order as the two other confirmed tev sources , making it a good candidate to probe the ebl that can in turn probe cosmological problems such as the formation of galaxies ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "1es1959@xmath165  is also part of a 200 mjy radio - selected sample at 5 ghz @xcite and it was seen in the einstein slew survey @xcite .",
    "multiple photometric optical values were found in the literature , showing a great variation of the source brightness in the optical band from @xmath17 to @xmath18 .",
    "a complete study of the optical band can be found in @xcite where variability on short timescales ( a few days ) was reported",
    ".    the capabilities of the usa and the pca instruments to monitor the x  ray emission are particularly well suited for the detailed study of the x  ray energy spectrum of 1es1959@xmath165 , and its temporal evolution . here , we present 31 usa and 17 pca observations of 1es1959@xmath165 .",
    "the pca data are two sets of intraday observations , obtained from unpublished rxte archival data , that span a few days in which the end of a flare and beginning of another flare are detected .",
    "the usa observations are short daily monitoring observations that span 7 weeks , ending with a strong flare , where the x  ray flux tripled in 7 days ( the usa data were taken in the context of a multi - wavelength campaign that was not successful in the tev range due to bad weather at the act site ) . in section 2 , we report the details of the observations ; in section 3 , we report the main features of the data ; in section 4 , we discuss the implications of the x  ray spectral variability and the quiescent x  ray emission detected in 1es1959@xmath165 ; we present our conclusions in section 5 .",
    "the usa experiment observed 1es1959@xmath165  about once per day between 2000 september 21 ( mjd 51808 ) and november 11 ( mjd 51859 ) .",
    "( for a detailed description of the usa experiment see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . )",
    "the usa detector was used in the `` ping '' mode where within one observation the source is pointed at 2 or 3 times for @xmath19 seconds and then a background is taken for @xmath20 seconds , where typically , @xmath19 = @xmath20 = 60 seconds and an observation lasted for @xmath3300 s ( for more details on the `` ping '' observation mode see @xcite ) .",
    "this type of observation has the advantage of not relying on a background model but rather on a direct measurement of the background , but results in some loss of signal within an observation period .",
    "usa data were extracted from fits formatted files using cfitsio .",
    "care was taken to use an @xmath21 position as devoid as possible of bright x  ray sources , and at least 2@xmath22 away from the source .",
    "observations were made in low background regions of the orbit , where the counting rate was approximately 30 cts / s or 1% of the crab level in the same conditions .",
    "the segments of the observation where the background is too high , especially at the beginning and the ending of each observation , are rejected . for the present investigation",
    ", we use only observations where at least 2 pairs of on - off pointings are available for each observation . within those restrictions ,",
    "31 observations were used from which @xmath23  ks of data were selected .",
    "we present the x  ray lightcurve for 1es1959@xmath165  in figure [ plotone ] ; in that figure , the standard deviation of the average in the background was added in quadrature to the error on the count rate for each observation .",
    "the data were then corrected for obscuration by the instrument support structure when necessary , and also for the collimator response .",
    "every point in the lightcurve is a single observation .",
    "the lightcurve ( normalized to the usa crab rate in the energy range defined below , or 3500 cts / s ) for the total range is shown in the top panel of figure [ plotone ] .",
    "the data were taken in the spectral mode , where the instrument integrates a spectrum covering an energy range of approximately 117  kev in 48 pulse height analyzer ( pha ) channels every 10 ms . in this work ,",
    "we make no use of the lowest ( 0 ) and the highest ( 47 ) pha channels ; the pha channels 146 ( @xmath24  kev ) are referred to as the total usa range .",
    "the spectral characteristics of the time series were studied by dividing the usa data into two energy bands , the pha channels 110 ( soft band ) and 1146 ( hard band ) , corresponding to approximately 13 kev and 316 kev , respectively .",
    "a hardness ratio , shown in the second from top panel in figure [ plotone ] , is the ratio of the counting rate in the hard band over the soft band .",
    "the dates are given in modified julian date ( mjd ) @xmath25 51000 .",
    "unpublished pca data of 1es1959@xmath165  were obtained from the rxte data archive .",
    "the rxte / pca observed 1es1959@xmath165  12 times from 2000 july 28 through august 2 , and 5 times between 2000 september 16 , with exposures of @xmath3900 s in the july - august observations and a few ksec each in september .",
    "the standard2 data were extracted using the heasarc ftools and filtered using the rxte gof - recommended criteria ( layer 1 only , for better signal to noise , pha channels 0 to 27 ( lightcurves only ) or approximately 1 - 10 kev , earth elevation angle greater than 10 degrees , pointing offset less than 0.02 degrees , time since the peak of the last saa passage greater than 30 minutes and electron contamination less than 0.1 ) .",
    "the lightcurve and spectral data are from unit 2 ( pcu 2 ) only since a faint background model is not yet available for unit 0 during gain epoch 5 .",
    "the background models of epoch 4 were used .",
    "lightcurves were extracted using the ftools ` saextrct ` ( through the ` rex ` script ) and ` lcurve ` .",
    "the variable pca background was modeled with ` pcabackest ` , which uses observations of x  ray blank , high latitude areas of the sky @xcite .",
    "spectral fits were done using xspec v. 11.0.1 and response matrices generated by the ftool ` pcarmf ` .",
    "the source was not detected with a better significance than @xmath26 with the rxte / hexte instruments .",
    "a likely explanation is the steep spectrum , derived from the pca data , that falls below the hexte sensitivity .",
    "an observation with the _ bepposax _ instrument in 1997 @xcite resulted in a measured flux of @xmath27 erg @xmath28 s@xmath29 in the 210 kev band and a spectral index of @xmath30 .",
    "this flux is an order of magnitude fainter than the brightest flux measured here by the pca .",
    "however , the results published by @xcite should be treated with caution , as there is an apparent error in the value of the galactic column adopted by them ( they adopt @xmath31 rather than @xmath32 atoms @xmath33 adopted by us on the basis of the colden program available as a part of the chandra proposal planning toolkit , based on relatively reliable 21 cm data ) .",
    "the analysis of the pspc all - sky survey data by those authors implies that assuming a simple power law , the fitted absorption is @xmath34 atoms @xmath33 , somewhat larger than the galactic value .",
    "however , this might be because the intrinsic x - ray spectrum steepens somewhat towards higher energies , as is often the case for other xbl - type blazars , and an assumption that the observed spectrum is a simple absorbed power law overestimates the fitted absorption .",
    "note that the higher column density makes no difference in the results from the usa or rxte data .",
    "the _ einstein _",
    "slew survey sample of bl lac objects @xcite quotes a flux of 3.65 @xmath35jy at 2 kev , which is @xmath340% brighter than the _ bepposax _ measurement .",
    "we also extracted the _ rosat _ hri archival data for this source , and used the _ rosat _ all - sky data .",
    "_ rosat _ hri observed it on 1996 april 1 ; the observation lasted for a total of half a day , yielding about 2800 sec of good data .",
    "the data were reduced in a standard manner , revealing that the net source counting rate was @xmath3 1.57 ct s@xmath29 , with no indication of variability , but this is not too surprising given the short observation length .",
    "the conversion of the hri count rate to flux is dependent on the source spectrum , which has to be assumed as there is essentially no spectral information in the hri data .",
    "since we do not know the soft x - ray spectrum at the epoch of the hri observation , we assume the energy index @xmath36 , but two different values of @xmath37 , the galactic value of @xmath38 @xmath28 and the fitted rosat value of @xmath34 @xmath28 . to obtain the conversion from the hri counting rate to the observed flux , we used the pimms tool provided by heasarc ( and checked the results using xspec with the hri effective area curve ) . assuming the galactic column of @xmath38 @xmath28",
    ", we obtain the 0.1 - 2.4 kev flux of @xmath39 erg @xmath28 s@xmath29 and 1 - 2 kev flux of @xmath40 erg @xmath28 s@xmath29 . assuming the fitted rosat value of @xmath34 @xmath28",
    ", we infer the 0.1 - 2.4 kev flux of @xmath41 erg @xmath28 s@xmath29 and 1 - 2 kev flux of @xmath42 erg @xmath28 s@xmath29 . in any case",
    ", this corresponds to ( roughly ) 2 mcrab , which is lower than the 13 mcrab level from the _ rosat all - sky survey bright source catalog _ ( 1rxs - b ) .",
    "this simply implies that during the _ rosat _ survey , 1es1959@xmath165  was significantly brighter than during the _ einstein _ , _ rosat _ hri or _",
    "bepposax _ observations , and the episodes of high flux as seen by the usa or rxte observations described hereafter are not unique .",
    "the usa and rxte observations of 1es1959@xmath165  conducted from july through november 2000 show that the source was bright and variable in the x  ray band , with the x  ray spectrum significantly harder than observed during the periods of lower brightness .",
    "specifically , these data show that during the last quarter of 2000 , 1es1959@xmath165  underwent an x  ray flare reaching the 12 mcrab level in the 1 - 16 kev band on november 14 ( mjd 51863 ) .",
    "variability of a factor @xmath36 was detected within 20 days , and a factor @xmath3 3 within 7 days ( figure  [ plotone ] ) . by comparison ,",
    "the peak flux detected by usa on mkn 421 in 2000 reached approximately 40 mcrab at maximum .",
    "visual inspection of the usa ( as well as the rxte ) lightcurves , and in particular of the largest flare , indicates that the source does not appear to vary significantly on timescales shorter than a day ; thus the variability is not undersampled .",
    "these observations show that 1es1959@xmath165  was in a variable state for at least 4 months . to complete the coverage of this flare ,",
    "3 data points from the rxte / asm were normalized to the crab and added to the lightcurve in figure  [ plotone ] ; this shows the flare continuing to decrease . the varying spectral index and differences in the energy response of both instruments",
    "complicate the comparison .",
    "nonetheless , the full - width at half - maximum region of the flare with these additional points spans 5 @xmath43 1 day , and the doubling time is 2.5 days .",
    "the pca archival data obtained 2 months prior to the usa observations show 65% flux changes in 3.5 days ; the highest observed value was @xmath44(2 - 10 kev ) = @xmath45 erg @xmath28 s@xmath29 , but the peak value is unknown , since the observed maxima are at the endpoints of the observed period , when the source was falling or rising as shown in figure  [ plottwo ] .",
    "the usa lightcurve shows that the pca did not cover the typical variation period which appears to be @xmath46 4 days .",
    "the same figure shows a decreasing flux extending over 3.5 days , and after 30 days observations resume for 4 days where a steady increase of flux is seen .",
    "the flux did not change more than a few percent on timescales shorter than a day in the pca data . in the three panels in figure [ plotthree ]",
    "it is apparent that variations are larger in the harder bands in the decreasing part of the pca observations .",
    "the pca data were used to perform spectral fits as a function of the flux in the 2 - 10 kev energy range .",
    "the data were fit to a single power - law function with index @xmath47 , such that the photon flux @xmath48 and the absorbing column @xmath37=10.27 @xmath49 @xmath28 .",
    "the absorbed power law model provides an adequate fit for all rxte pca pointings .",
    "spectral indices were obtained for every observation , and in some cases , intraday observations where the estimated indices and fluxes were similar were added together to improve the significance on a daily timescale .",
    "the spectral fits are shown in table 2 along with the month , day and fraction of the day of the beginning of each observation .",
    "the x  ray spectrum follows a `` loop '' in the spectral index - flux plane , as seen in figure [ plotfour ] , and it is not surprising that the x  ray spectrum shows significant evolution during the flare given that there is a more rapid rise and drop in the hard x  ray band ( see  [ par : disc ] for discussion ) .",
    "the steepest spectrum in the pca data was observed at the first observations in the declining phase july 28 ( @xmath50 ) , and the hardest spectrum was seen on 2 dates separated by a month and at a similar flux ( @xmath51 ) which is a hint that the same physical mechanism is generating these flux variations . in the case of the usa observation , poorer photon statistics and an incomplete energy calibration limited the spectral study to a hardness ratio ( hr ) estimation plotted on the same figure [ plotone ] .",
    "the usa fluxes and hr are shown in table 1 . during the strongest flare , that started around ( mjd-51000)=857 , a @xmath52 variation in the hr is observed .",
    "the electromagnetic emission in blazars is very likely to be doppler - boosted ( or beamed ) towards the observer . in the radio regime , the evidence comes from superluminal expansions observed with vlbi .",
    "similar superluminal expansions have now been seen in the optical band with the _ hst _ in nearby galaxies such as m87 .",
    "relativistic beaming is also required in order to avoid absorption of gev photons by x ",
    "ray photons via the e@xmath53/e@xmath54 pair - production process .",
    "it is thus possible to use the x  ray variability data as well as the fact that 1es1959@xmath165  is an egret - detected bl lac object , to establish a limit for the doppler factor @xmath55 , with @xmath55 defined in the standard way as @xmath56^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath2 is the bulk lorentz factor of the plasma in the jet , @xmath57 and @xmath58 is the angle to the line of sight .    assuming that the @xmath10-rays and x",
    " rays from 1es1959@xmath165  are produced in the same region , it is possible to calculate the opacity for pair production @xmath59 from the source sizes inferred from the usa and rxte / pca data .",
    "the formula given by equation ( 3 ) in @xcite for the optical depth for an outflow which is nonrelativistic in its comoving frame , as corrected by @xcite , is @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the doubling time in units of @xmath62 s and @xmath63 the reduced hubble constant in units of 60 km s@xmath29 mpc@xmath29 .",
    "using the parameters found in 1es1959@xmath165  ( @xmath11 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66jy ) , the opacity for 1 gev photons would be @xmath67 , and @xmath68 is required in order to have @xmath69 .",
    "the limit on the required doppler factor is less than that required for mkn 421 ( @xmath70 ) , which is not surprising since timescales of @xmath71 days and a slightly higher luminosity are involved in that object .    strictly speaking ,",
    "the above @xmath59 argument for anisotropy only applies if the @xmath10-ray emitting zone is the same as the soft x ",
    "ray - emitting region and , for now , we have no clear observational indications that this is the case .",
    "this is important , since the jets are likely to be inhomogeneous .",
    "however , since @xmath10-ray variability on timescales shorter than a day has been measured  and since there is an obvious correlation between x ",
    "rays and @xmath10-rays that has been seen in objects such as mkn 421 and mkn 501  for such sources @xmath72 a few can be deduced as well .",
    "relativistic source motion , however , does not avoid the problem of the gamma - ray pair production on the external , unbeamed photons likely to be present in the environments currently envisioned for the central engines of such sources .    the x  ray data presented above imply that the x  ray spectrum of 1es1959@xmath165  hardens as the source brightens .",
    "this is often measured in bl lac objects ; a hardening of the spectrum when flares occur , and a blueward shift of the peak of the synchrotron emission ( and presumably higher energy inverse - compton emission ) by factors that can be as large as 100 was measured in the cases of mkn 501 @xcite , 1es 1426@xmath1428 and pks 0548@xmath25322 @xcite . in the case of pks 2005 - 489 @xcite , a more moderate shift of a factor of 3 or less of the synchrotron emission was found .",
    "the spectral change is best illustrated as a correlation between flux and the photon index .",
    "using pca data this correlation is illustrated in figure [ plotfour ] . even though the two observations were separated by a month and are certainly related to two different flares , it is still interesting to compare this spectral evolution since the time series have similar rise and fall timescales , which are also comparable to what is seen in the usa detector .",
    "it is thus likely that the two flares originate from a similar mechanism and that the correlation plot has some validity .",
    "the `` clockwise motion '' ( shown with arrows ) observed in the data for 1es1959@xmath165 has also been seen in flares in mkn 421 @xcite , in pks 2155@xmath25304 @xcite and in h0323@xmath1022 @xcite , although in some cases counterclockwise patterns have also been seen ( mkn 501 , @xcite ) .",
    "the spectrum steepens more rapidly than the flux in the declining phase and hardens rapidly in the brightening phase , indicating that the variations of the hard x  rays occur faster than those in the soft x ",
    "rays both during the increase and the decrease of the brightness of the source .",
    "the spectral index change of @xmath73 seen here is comparable to the @xmath74 seen in mkn 421 .",
    "the variation observed in the flux - index plane can provide information about the acceleration process @xcite .",
    "counter - clockwise patterns are expected when acceleration , variability and cooling timescales are similar in a flare . in this case",
    "the acceleration process proceeds from low energy to high energy changing the number of particles and making the softer energies vary first .",
    "clockwise patterns , where the harder energies vary first , can be explained in flares where the variability and acceleration timescales are much less than the cooling timescale .    for a homogeneous emitting region ,",
    "the radiative lifetime of a relativistic electron emitting synchrotron photons with energy @xmath75 is ( in the observer s frame ) @xmath76 s @xcite .",
    "this should give some estimate of the magnetic field @xmath77 , even though the extent to which the timescale of the flux decrease was due to the propagation of the signal throughout the source and to what extent it was caused by the synchrotron cooling is not known .",
    "however , it is possible to measure the relative decrease of the flux @xmath78 in three energy bands in a time @xmath79 using the pca data as seen in figure [ plotthree ] . to estimate the timescale for a drop by a factor of two in each energy band ,",
    "the measured timescale is divided by a factor @xmath80 .",
    "the factor @xmath78 is smallest for the lowest energy band ( 24% ) as expected .",
    "it is now possible to find @xmath81 7.7 , 4.9 and @xmath82 s , respectively , for 3 , 7 and 12 kev photons .",
    "according to @xcite we write @xmath83 . comparing the decline of the flux of 3 kev and 12 kev photons yield @xmath84 g , while the decay of the 7 kev and 12 kev photons yield a similar result of @xmath85 g . using @xmath86 we infer @xmath87 g. it is interesting to note here that this is a similar value to that found by @xcite ( p99 hereafter ) in an outburst of pks 2005@xmath25489 where variability on timescales of days was observed .",
    "the peak observed frequency of the synchrotron emission @xmath88 of an electron with @xmath89 is given by @xmath90 hz .",
    "using the magnetic field inferred above , the lorentz factors of the electrons @xmath89 radiating at energy @xmath91 can be estimated from @xmath92 kev .",
    "this implies that @xmath89 of electrons refers to the lorentz factors of individual radiating particles as distinct from the jet bulk lorentz factor @xmath2 ] radiating in the x  ray band is @xmath3 @xmath94 .",
    "the value of @xmath77 calculated as above is significantly lower than 0.2 g , and @xmath89 higher than @xmath95 inferred for mkn 421 by @xcite , but the values inferred by us are similar to those quoted for pks 2005@xmath25489 by p99 where a possible undersampling was invoked to explain the possibility of faster ( shorter than @xmath3 1 day ) variability , which in turn would make the inferred value for @xmath77 a lower limit and @xmath89 an upper limit .",
    "we believe that in 1es1959@xmath165 the flux is sampled relatively densely , and thus the variability is unlikely to be undersampled .",
    "this means that the difference in the inferred values of @xmath77 and @xmath89 in 1es1959@xmath165  as compared to mkn 421 is unlikely to be a result of the source being more compact , while this could be the case for the potentially undersampled data for pks 2005@xmath25489 ( p99 ) . with our inferred source parameters being so close to the values found for pks 2005@xmath25489",
    ", it is now quite possible that real differences between these two sources and mkn 421 exist .",
    "a conclusive test of the physical parameters in this source would be a clear detection of the tev @xmath10-ray emission , and any correlation with the x  ray flux . also ,",
    "longer , more sensitive and well - sampled observations in the x  ray band are needed to either confirm or disprove that the variability pattern of 1es1959@xmath165  and its spectral properties are as described here .",
    "a noticeable difference between pks 2005@xmath25489 and 1es1959@xmath165   is that whereas in the latter a variation in the spectral index @xmath96 was associated with a flux change of a factor of 30 , in the former a @xmath97 produced only a 65% change in the flux .",
    "also note in the usa data , a doubling of the hardness ratio is accompanied by a factor of 6 increase in flux .",
    "the usa lightcurve exhibits a non - zero x ",
    "ray flux outside of the flaring events of a few 10@xmath98 erg @xmath28 s@xmath29 ( or a few mcrab , taking 1 crab @xmath99 1.7@xmath10010@xmath101 erg @xmath28 s@xmath29 in the 210 kev band ) .",
    "the existence of a steady underlying emission in at least one other bl lac object , mkn 421 , has been invoked in order to obtain meaningful fits with an exponential decay to x ",
    "ray flares @xcite .",
    "it is intriguing to investigate if such steady flux could originate in more extended jets such as those recently resolved by the _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm _ telescopes , but aligned more closely to our line of sight and thus brighter . such knots ( or hotspots )",
    "in large - scale ( hundreds of parsecs or more ) jets have indeed been seen from radio to x  ray energies in many _",
    "non - aligned _ sources i.e. sources where the jet is sufficiently misaligned to allow us to resolve the structure of the jet ; of course such structures must also originate on a relatively large spatial scale as compared to the sub - parsec jets responsible for the rapid , day - scale variability . these knots are persistent structures visible on timescales of years , and individual spectral energy distributions ( seds ) have been established for knots in multiple sources such as m87 @xcite or pks 0637@xmath25752 @xcite .",
    "their fluxes are usually a fraction of the flux arising from the unresolved core , but a closer alignment to our line of sight than for those sources resolved by chandra and xmm would result in greater doppler boost and could provide a continuous background seen in bl lac - type objects , presumably the objects most closely aligned to our line of sight .    to verify if a flux of a few 10@xmath98 erg @xmath28 s@xmath29 could originate from aligned x ",
    "ray knots , some fluxes are taken from the literature for the cases where the angles to the line of sight ( @xmath58 hereafter ) and lorentz factors are available from radio observations . with this , it is possible to estimate the flux enhancement for @xmath102 and the luminosity at a distance similar to that of 1es1959@xmath165 .",
    "the observed flux would depend on three factors :    * a change in doppler boost that multiplies the flux @xmath44 by @xmath103 ( see @xcite for luminosity conversions ) where @xmath104 is the doppler factor for the same source but with an angle @xmath105 .",
    "thus the amplification would be @xmath106 ^ 4 $ ] .",
    "knowing the lorentz factor @xmath2 we can write @xmath107=@xmath108 * the distance difference changes the flux by a factor of @xmath109 *   a k - correction has to be applied since the bandwidth is narrowed , changing the flux by a factor of @xmath110 where @xmath47 is the spectral index .",
    "this effect is minimal compared to the previous ones since in the x  ray band usually @xmath111 for bl lac spectra .",
    "the final ratio @xmath112 of the observed fluxes is then the product of these three terms .",
    "the most popular scenario for the `` parent population '' of xbl - type blazars such as 1es1959@xmath165  is that these objects are fr - i type radio galaxies with their jets aligned close to our line of sight ( see , e.g. , urry , padovani , & stickel 1991 , ups91 hereafter ) .",
    "in contrast , pks 0637 - 752 is a member of the intrinsically more powerful fr - ii class of objects .",
    "we thus believe that it is appropriate to compare 1es1959@xmath165  with the fr i radio galaxy m87 ( @xmath113 ) , a nearby object that has knots resolved in the x  ray band @xcite as well as in the radio and optical ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . in the most popular models",
    "the x  ray radiation is either synchrotron radiation or inverse compton scattering ( see e.g. @xcite ) . from @xcite ( b99 hereafter )",
    "we find that a relativistic jet model requires a bulk flow with lorentz factor @xmath114 and a jet orientation within @xmath115 from the line of sight .",
    "we will use two sets of @xmath116 presented in b99 based on this model .",
    "the set @xmath117 is a possible configuration of the jet .",
    "these values may offer an explanation for the apparent lack of superluminal motion in m87 on parsec scales , and were assumed in the model of @xcite . from @xcite the flux density at 1 kev , summed over all the knots , is approximately 380 njy and @xmath118 . using a distance of 16 mpc for m87 , @xmath119 = 60 km s@xmath29 mpc@xmath29 and @xmath120=0.1 ,",
    "then @xmath121 would yield @xmath3 20@xmath100 10@xmath98 erg @xmath28 s@xmath29 ( or 8 mcrab ) of flux coming from the knots . in this case , using an angle of @xmath122 would reduce the flux ratio by a factor of 8 ( from 250 ) which would still keep the boosted knot radiation in the detectable range .",
    "an angle of @xmath123 was used as well in this example since this is the mean value of angle to the line of sight used recently by @xcite as an input parameter for the successful synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) model those authors have used to predict tev candidate bl lac objects .",
    "the set of values @xmath124 also presented in b99 and consistent with their results yield a flux coming from the knots that is 40 times smaller ( or 0.2 mcrab ) .",
    "this configuration is thus less likely to result in a flux of the level that is being looked for .",
    "3c66b is a low - luminosity fri radio galaxy ( @xmath125 ) .",
    "its jet has knots resolved in the radio , optical and x  ray band ( @xcite and references therein ) . from @xcite we find that @xmath58 seems well constrained ( about @xmath126 ) but that @xmath2 is not ( between 1 and 7 ) .    the set @xmath127 is a possible configuration of the jet that would come within the right order of magnitude to explain the origin of the x  ray radiation by ic scattering of seed photons from a hidden bl lac in the nucleus of 3c66b . from @xcite the flux density at 1 kev , for the 2 brightest knots out of 5 ( a and b ) , is approximately 10 njy .",
    "a value of @xmath128 is used , the one found for the jet , though the exact value does not matter much given the comparable redshift of 3c66b to the one of 1es1959@xmath165 .",
    "the inferred value of @xmath129 yields @xmath3 4@xmath100 10@xmath130 erg @xmath28 s@xmath29 ( or 230 mcrab ) of flux coming from the knots in the case of an angle at @xmath131 .",
    "using an angle of @xmath122 would reduce the flux ratio by a factor of 2 only and make it still a bright steady source .",
    "the level of expected radiation in this case is actually so high that a similar object pointing closer to the line of sight would not be unnoticed in radio emission , thus the @xmath127 set seems quite extreme .    taking a slower jet ( @xmath132 )",
    "also mentioned in @xcite the flux coming from the knots of 3c66b would be a factor of @xmath133 lower than in the previous case , significantly below the level of a few 10@xmath98 erg @xmath28 s@xmath29 .",
    "the results from m87 and 3c66b show that it is possible that radiation from knots moving close to the line of sight can generate a significant fraction of the baseline level of x  ray flux invoked in at least two cases , mkn 421 and 1es1959@xmath165  here , assuming they contain knots similar to those observed in m87 or 3c66b .",
    "recent vlbi observations show that the line of sight angle with mkn 421 is constrained to be in the @xmath134 range @xcite , thus a small angle to the line of sight is a possibility for this source . in a more general way",
    ", ups91 predict that fr i radio galaxies should have jets with bulk flow speeds in the range from @xmath135 5 to @xmath3 35 , with most near @xmath135 7 , and they derive a critical angle @xmath136 for the fr i / bl lac division . if bright knots are common in bl lac objects then the amplification factors associated with the large lorentz factors invoked here could generate a continuous background at the level mentioned above ( assuming @xmath58 is of the order of a few degrees only ) . a more thorough search for evidence of continuous emission in blazars and other signatures of boosted knot radiation",
    "is currently under way .",
    "this paper reports x  ray data obtained with the usa and rxte missions , as well as archival observations for the bl lac object 1es1959@xmath165 .",
    "variability on the timescale of a few days with a threefold flux increase in the 116 kev band was observed with the usa detector ; this is consistent with timescales that have been seen in the optical band at other times .",
    "the x  ray data also show a clear correlation of the x  ray flux with the spectrum , which becomes harder when the source is brighter .",
    "the data presented in this paper represent an important contribution to the study of this object , a potential tev emitter , as long term monitoring observations of it in the x  ray band were seldom performed in the past .    from the x  ray variability time scales , we estimate the doppler factor of the jet to be @xmath46 1.6 .",
    "the spectral variability data allow an estimate of the magnetic field which is lower ( @xmath3 milligauss ) , and lorentz factor of radiating electrons which is higher ( @xmath137 ) than those derived for the prototype tev blazar mkn 421 .",
    "these parameters are more in line with those inferred for another possible tev - emitting blazar , pks 2005@xmath25489 .",
    "the data also show the need for x  ray observations of 1es1959@xmath165  longer than a few days in order to more accurately characterize the timescale of variability and its relationship with the spectrum .",
    "also , since the source has been seen to be extremely variable in the optical band , future multi - wavelength observations of this object should include simultaneous optical observations .",
    "we attempted to give a plausible scenario explaining the apparent baseline ( `` quiescent '' ) emission level seen here in 1es1959@xmath165  but also possibly previously observed in mkn 421 .",
    "jets containing bright knots such as those seen by _",
    "chandra _ , but aligned more closely , within a few degrees to the line of sight ( and therefore not resolvable as easily as jets with larger angles ) and with lorentz factors of @xmath138 have the required boosted flux to account for the `` quiescent '' x  ray emission in xbl - type bl lac objects .",
    "such emission would persist on timescales much longer than the duration of the flares that are much more likely to occur closer to the central object .",
    "this scenario can be confirmed by a more systematic study of knot x  ray luminosities in fr i objects , as well as the currently ongoing population study of the steady component of x  ray emission in bl lac objects .",
