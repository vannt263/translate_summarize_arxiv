    "implicit solvent models are widely used in theoretical chemistry to study the solvation of biomolecular systems , as well described in the review of roux and simonson@xcite .",
    "they provide a more efficient , although generally less accurate , alternative to atomistically - resolved explicit solvent simulations . the solvation free energy in these models is usually split into nonpolar ( np ) and polar ( p ) terms , @xmath0 which are treated in separate energetic evaluations .",
    "the nonpolar term includes the energetic cost of cavity formation , solvent rearrangement , and solute - solvent dispersion interactions introduced when the uncharged solute is brought from vacuum into the solvent environment .",
    "the polar term describes the free energy of charging the mono- or multipolar solute in the dielectric medium .",
    "the nonpolar term is commonly approximated by surface area models , i.e.  @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the solvent accessible surface area@xcite and @xmath3 is an energy per surface area constant , which is a priori not known but fit to atomistic simulations . the deficiencies of this simple surface area approach have been recognized and a further decomposition of the nonpolar term into cavity ( cav ) and van der waals dispersion ( vdw ) terms has been proposed,@xcite @xmath4 .",
    "this approach has shown improved results for the solvation of alkanes,@xcite the alanine peptide,@xcite and nonpolar native and misfolded proteins.@xcite the electrostatic ( polar ) contribution of the solvation free energy is often approximated by generalized born@xcite ( gb ) or poisson - boltzmann@xcite ( pb ) models .",
    "both methods use a position - dependent dielectric constant,@xcite assigned on the basis of the solute surface , which can be defined in several ways,@xcite or defined implicitly by integration methods .",
    "it has been emphasized that all three contributions , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 depend critically on the location of the solvent - solute interface .",
    "it has _ also _ been shown that the effective location of the solvent - solute interface can vary according to the local electrostatic@xcite and dispersion@xcite potentials .",
    "this suggests that interfacial , dispersion and electrostatic contributions should be coupled in implicit solvent approaches .",
    "the importance of capturing the right balance between nonpolar and electrostatic contributions in implicit solvation models was emphasized by ashbaugh _",
    "_ in their study of amphiphiles.@xcite    the significance of nonpolar and polar coupling becomes even more evident when solvation is studied on length scales which are large compared to the solvent molecule ( typically @xmath8 1 nm for water ) , where solvent dewetting ( drying ) can occur . in this mechanism , first envisioned by stillinger,@xcite",
    "the solvent molecules tend to move away from the surface of a large nonpolar solute forming a liquid - gas like interface parallel to the solute interface .",
    "when the surfaces of two large solutes come together dewetting can be amplified due to the gain of interfacial free energy ( by decreasing the total liquid - vapor interface area ) giving rise to a strong effective attraction.@xcite early evidence of confinement - induced dewetting was given only by explicit water simulations for smooth plate - like solutes with a purely repulsive solute - solvent interaction.@xcite more recently , however , it has been demonstrated in varying degrees in several systems with attractive solute - solvent interactions including smooth parallel plate - like solutes,@xcite atomistically resolved paraffin - plates,@xcite graphite - plates@xcite , carbon nanotubes,@xcite and hydrophobic ion channels.@xcite    several of these studies indicated that the magnitude of dewetting is sensitive to the nature of the solute - solvent attractive dispersion interactions .",
    "@xcite a similar sensitivity was found in systems where the solutes carry charges or are exposed to an external electric field , e.g. electrostatic interactions have been shown to strongly affect the dewetting behavior of hydrophobic channels@xcite and hydrophobic spherical nanosolutes.@xcite furthermore , two recent simulations of proteins supported the importance of solvent dewetting and its sensitivity in realistic biomolecular systems .",
    "first , a simulation of the two - domain bphc enzyme showed that the region between the two domains was completely dewetted when vdw and electrostatic interactions were turned off , but accommodated 30@xmath9 of the bulk density with the addition of vdw attraction ( water was found mainly at the edges of the considered volume , while the central region was still empty ) , and 85 - 90@xmath9 with the addition of electrostatic interactions.@xcite second , liu _",
    "et al . _ observed a clear dewetting transition in the simulation of the collapse of the melittin tetramer , which was strongly sensitive to the type and location of the hydrophobic residues around the dewetted region.@xcite    considering the aforementioned studies , we postulate that coupling of the nonpolar and polar solvation contributions in implicit solvent models is crucial for an accurate determination of solvation free energies without too many system - dependent fit parameters .",
    "we suggest a general theoretical formalism in which the particular energetic contributions are coupled .",
    "similar to the approach of parker _",
    "_ in their study of bubble formation at hydrophobic surfaces,@xcite we express the gibbs free energy as a _ functional _ of the solvent volume exclusion function,@xcite and obtain the optimal solute surface via minimization .",
    "as we will show , this minimization leads to an expression which is similar to the laplace - young equation for the description of macroscopic capillary interfaces,@xcite but is generalized to explicitly include curvature corrections and solvent - solute interactions , i.e. short - range repulsion ( excluded volume ) , dispersion , and electrostatics .",
    "this extension of the laplace - young theory allows a geometric description of solvation on mesoscopic and microscopic scales .",
    "related approaches in other fields are the helfrich description of vesicle and membrane surfaces,@xcite wetting in colloids and granular media,@xcite and functional treatments of electrowetting.@xcite    while most implicit solvent approaches define the solute surface with a geometrical evaluation of the molecular surface , vdw surface , or canonical solvent accessible surface ( sas),@xcite it is an output of our theory . the surface obtained by minimizing our free energy functional will , in general ,",
    "be very different than the aforementioned established surface definitions .",
    "in particular , our solvent accessible surface should not be confused with the canonical sas,@xcite which is simply the envelope surrounding probe - inflated spheres .",
    "similarly , phenomenological continuum theories applied to solvent dewetting always assume a certain , simplified geometry for the dry region , e.g. a cylindrical volume for system like hydrophobic ion channels , @xcite plate - like particles,@xcite or two hydrophobic spherical solutes.@xcite for a few simple systems this might be a valid approximation but for more complicated solute geometries the shape of the dewetted volume is unknown and a different approach , as suggested in this work , is necessary .",
    "we expect our formalism to be particularly useful in solvation studies of large protein assemblies where the hydrophobic surfaces are highly irregular and laced with hydrophilic units,@xcite and for which a unified description of hydration on different length scales is important.@xcite another potential application is the solvation of superhydrophobic nanosolutes@xcite and wetting / dewetting in near - critical colloidal mixtures.@xcite    a brief summary of our work has been published elsewhere.@xcite here we present more challenging test cases and an expanded discussion of the approximations and limitations of this model .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we present our theoretical formalism and chosen approximations . in section iii we first verify that our method can describe solvation on molecular scales with noble gases , ions , and small alkanes .",
    "we then demonstrate that it captures the strong sensitivity of dewetting and hydrophobic hydration to specific solute - solvent interactions on larger scales with two alkane - assembled spheres . in section",
    "iv we conclude with some final remarks .",
    "let us consider an assembly of solutes with arbitrary shape and composition surrounded by a dielectric solvent in a volume @xmath10 .",
    "furthermore , we define a subvolume ( or cavity ) @xmath11 empty of solvent for which we can assign a volume exclusion function given by @xmath12 we assume that the surface surrounding the volume is continuous and closed , i.e.  has no boundary .",
    "the absolute volume @xmath13 and surface area @xmath2 of @xmath11 can then be expressed as functionals of @xmath14 via @xmath15=\\int_{\\cal w}{\\rm d}^3r \\;[1-v(\\vec r ) ] \\nonumber \\\\",

    "the expression @xmath20 can thus be identified as the infinitesimal surface element . in this continuum solvent model",
    "the solvent density distribution is simply @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the bulk density of the solvent at the desired temperature and pressure .",
    "local inhomogeneities of the solvent density , apart from the zero to @xmath22 transition at the volume boundaries , are neglected .",
    "the solutes positions and conformations are fixed such that the solutes can be considered as an external potential to the solvent without any degrees of freedom .    as motivated before ,",
    "we suggest expressing the gibbs free energy @xmath23 $ ] as a functional of the volume exclusion function @xmath14 , and obtaining the optimal solute volume via minimization @xmath24/\\delta v(\\vec r)=0 , \\label{min}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 denotes the functional derivative with respect to the function @xmath26 .",

    "this term is relatively small and can generally be neglected for solutes on molecular scales . the second term @xmath30 $ ] describes the energetic cost due to solvent rearrangement around the cavity _ interface _ with area @xmath2 in terms of a free energy / surface area functional @xmath31)$ ] .",
    "this interfacial energy penalty is thought to be the main driving force behind hydrophobic phenomena.@xcite @xmath3 is a solvent specific quantity that also depends on the particular topology of the cavity - solvent interface , i.e.  it varies locally in space and is a functional of the volume exclusion function @xmath32)$].@xcite the exact form of this functional is not known .    the third term ,",

    "in contrast to pb / sa models however , the dielectric boundary is optimized such that it responds to the local nonpolar and polar potential ; it is not assumed beforehand .",

    "for a planar macroscopic interface the parameter @xmath3 is usually identified by the surface tension of the solvent adjacent to the second medium .",
    "this surface tension obviously depends on the microscopic interactions between the medium and the solvent and is generally decreased by attractive dispersion or electrostatic contributions .",
    "it seems that microscopic interactions are adequately represented by a macroscopic quantity like @xmath3 _ if _ their range is much smaller than the investigated length scales , such as the radii of curvature or mean particle distances .",
    "the effect of the microscopic interactions are then absorbed in @xmath3 .",
    "this has been exemplified with free energy estimates for the solvation of large , neutral plate - like or spherical alkane - assembled solutes,@xcite for the description of solvation on smaller length scales , however , it seems important to separate the free energy into a part which accounts for the formation of a cavity and a part which describes the dispersion interactions explicitly.@xcite furthermore , it has been shown that the water liquid - vapor surface tension @xmath63 is the asymptotic value of the solvation free energy per surface area for hard spherical cavities in water in the limit of large radii.@xcite these considerations motivate our choice of the second and third term in the functional ( [ eq : grand ] ) and lead to the assumption @xmath64 in the limit of vanishing curvatures .",

    "we have chosen the convention in which the curvatures are positive for convex surfaces ( e.g. a spherical cavity ) and negative for concave surfaces ( e.g. a spherical droplet ) .",
    "the curvature dependence of the liquid - vapor surface tension has been a long standing subject of research and is still under steady discussion.@xcite for water , which is close to the critical point under ambient conditions , @xmath3 is argued to be nonanalytical in curvature.@xcite the first order correction term , however , is likely to be linear in curvature as predicted by scaled - particle theory,@xcite the commonly used ansatz to study the solvation of hard spherical cavities . although this result is only strictly valid for the case of spherical particles , we assume that it can be applied to local mean curvatures such that @xmath31)$ ] reduces to the function @xmath70 where @xmath19 is the tolman length , which is expected to be of molecular size.@xcite in our study we assume @xmath19 is constant and positive , while the curvature can be positive or negative as defined above .",
    "note that this leads to an increase of surface tension for concave surfaces in agreement with the geometrical arguments of honig _",
    "et al._@xcite in their solvation study of alkanes .",
    "it has been shown by computer simulations of growing a hard spherical cavity in water that ( [ h ] ) predicts the interfacial energy rather well for radii @xmath71.@xcite a major drawback of approximation ( [ h ] ) is that it gives unphysical results if the radius of mean curvature is smaller than twice the tolman length , @xmath72 .",
    "it yields negative and diverging surface tensions for convex and concave surfaces , respectively .",

    "the corresponding force is discontinuous at this critical distance .",

    "when surface charges ( @xmath168 ) are added in system vi , the range of hydrophobic attraction further decreases but the total attraction increases at short intersolute distances .",

    "given the physically reasonable values of the parameters @xmath19 and @xmath215 we found by fitting , we hope that extensions based on physical rational , e.g. given by complementary microscopic approaches@xcite and further empirical corrections , will lead to an accurate fit - parameter free implicit solvent description .    we have further demonstrated that on larger scales , where solvent dewetting can play an important role in solvation , our formalism captures the delicate balance between hydrophobic , dispersive and electrostatic forces which has been observed in previous systems.@xcite the dewetting in our model is driven by the interfacial term which favors minimizing the solute - solvent interface .",
    "a comment must be made here regarding the sensitivity of dewetting to the particular solvent - solute interactions .",
    "as recently argued by chandler,@xcite extended fluid interfaces near phase coexistence are often referred to as soft because they can be deformed with only little or no free - energy change.@xcite our approach seems to account for this sensitivity since small changes of the constraints in the differential equation ( [ diff ] ) for the shape function , given e.g. by the dispersion potential close to the solute surface , can lead to a major deformation or even rupture ( wetting transition ) of the inter - solute , dewetted region . as we have shown , this can significantly change the pmf for the solutes .",
    "thus we anticipate that slight changes in the geometry of a system , e.g. a slight concave or convex bending of two plate - like solutes,@xcite can lead to very different results for the dewetting magnitude and the pmf .",
