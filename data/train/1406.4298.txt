    "bilayer graphene shares with monolayer graphene many properties holding a very high potential for electronics applications such as the excellent electric and thermal conductivities at room temperature or a possibility to control the electronic structure externally ( see for review refs.@xcite )",
    ". however , bilayer graphene ( blg ) also exhibits the unique features that make it qualitatively distinct from monolayer graphene ( mlg ) .",
    "for instance , the integer quantum hall effect in blg indicates the presence of massive chiral quasi - particles with a parabolic dispersion at low energies ( rather than massless quasi - particles with a linear dispersion in mlg ) . from application point of view",
    "the ability to open a gap in the blg energy spectrum and to turn it flexibly by an external electric field is exclusively important .",
    "it is expected that the blg - based nano - devices would show the functionalities different from those in the corresponding mlg - based devices . moreover , with only two layers in structure the blg represents the thinnest possible limit of a large class of intercalated materials which are recently attracting much attention from condensed matter physicists as well as material science researchers @xcite .    as is well - known , an external periodic potential can essentially modify the energy band structure of materials resulting in unusual transport properties .",
    "the energy band structure of mlg under a periodic potential ( monolayer graphene superlattice - mlgsl ) has been extensively studied in a number of works for the potentials of different natures ( electrostatic @xcite or magnetic @xcite ) and different shapes ( kronig - penny @xcite , cosine @xcite or square @xcite ) .",
    "interesting discoveries have been reported , such as a strongly anisotropic renormalization of the carrier group velocity and an emergence of extra dirac points ( dps ) in the band structure of electrostatic mlgsls @xcite or an emergence of finite - energy dps in the band structure of magnetic ones @xcite . much less work has been devoted to the blg - superlattices ( blgsls ) @xcite .",
    "barbier , vasilopoulos , and peeters ( bvp ) introduced the kronig - penny model of blgsls with @xmath0-function potentials and predicted that either a pair of zero - energy touching points is generated or a direct band gap is opened in the energy spectrum , depending on the strength of the @xmath0-function potentials @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we study the energy band structure of blgsls within the same model of zero - averaged periodic @xmath0-function potentials as that stated by bvp @xcite ( hereafter referred to as bvp - model for short ) .",
    "our study is however focused on examining the touching points between adjacent minibands , including the zero - energy touching points claimed before in ref.@xcite and the finite - energy touching points identified first in this work .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.2",
    "we briefly describe the problem under study within the four - band continuum model and supplement the zero - energy touching points claimed before with the dispersion that shows the dirac - like double - cone shape and the group velocity which is periodic in the potential strength @xmath1 with period of @xmath2 and becomes strongly anisotropic at relatively large @xmath1 . in sec.3",
    "we show that for any finite potential strength there always exist the finite - energy touching points at zero wave number @xmath3 , regardless of whether there are zero - energy touching points or whether there is a band gap .",
    "impressively , the dispersion associated to these touching points is direction - dependent in the sense that in one direction the dispersion is linear whereas in other direction it is parabolic .",
    "sec.4 presents the density of states and the conductivity that demonstrate possible manifestations of the touching points of interest .",
    "the paper is closed with a brief summary in sec.5 .",
    "we consider blgsls arising from an infinitely flat bernal - stacked blg in a periodic one - dimensional potential @xmath4 . within the continuum nearest - neighbor",
    ", tight - binding model the four - band hamiltonian describing low - energy excitations near one dirac point ( say , @xmath5 ) for these blgsls has the form : @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the in - plane momentum , @xmath9 is the fermi velocity , @xmath10 is the intralayer nearest - neighbor hopping energy , @xmath11 is the lattice constant of graphene , @xmath12 is the interlayer nearest - neighbor hopping energy , and @xmath13 is the identity matrix .",
    "this hamiltonian is limited to the case of symmetric on - site energies .",
    "the potential @xmath14 under study is the zero - averaged periodic @xmath0-function potential with strength @xmath1 and period @xmath15 defined as [ see fig.1@xmath16 : @xmath17 \\ \\}.\\ ] ]    in fact , the model studied is exactly the one introduced by bvp ( bvp - model ) @xcite .",
    "these authors claimed that in studying the energy band structure of ( at least ) blgsls with the @xmath0-function potentials the two - band approximation [ see for example @xcite ] is not accurate enough and the four - band hamiltonian of eq.(1 ) should be applied .",

    "actually , such a picture of the zero - energy touching points or the band gap has been reported before by bvp @xcite and it is here included for additional discussions . before going over to detailed considerations we would like here to note that due to the symmetry of the periodic potential @xmath14 of eq.(2 ) ( with a zero spatial average ) the energy spectrum of the blgsls under study should be symmetric with respect to the sign of energy that results in a double - cone dispersion in the vicinity of all the zero - energy touching points existed , and therefore these touching points could be referred to as the zero - energy dps .",
    "we will return to this point later .",

    "noticing that like @xmath57 these velocities are periodic in @xmath1 with the period of @xmath2 and , additionally , in one period they are symmetric with respect to the middle point @xmath94 , it is enough to analyze the picture in a half of the period .",
    "clearly , in both the cases under consideration the two curves @xmath95 and @xmath96 are practically coincided at small @xmath1 , indicating an isotropy of the dirac cones in this region of @xmath1-values . however , with increasing @xmath1 , two velocities become largely separated , showing a strong anisotropy of the dirac cones in the cases of large potential strength @xmath1 .",
    "thus , fig.3 demonstrates an interesting feature of the new zero - energy dps : given a potential period @xmath15 the dispersion cone is practically isotropic if the potential strength @xmath1 is small and becomes strongly anisotropic at large @xmath1 .(actually , the value @xmath97 below which the dispersion could be considered isotropic depends slightly on @xmath15 : in fig.3 @xmath98 or @xmath99 for @xmath55 or @xmath56 , respectively ) .",

    "comparing the boxes in fig.7 to each other reveals additional features as follows @xmath73 for blgsls with @xmath80 [ @xmath104 and @xmath19 ] both the conductivities @xmath152 and @xmath150 are in average smaller than the conductivity of the pristine blg and slightly decrease with increasing @xmath1 ; @xmath76 for blgsls with @xmath24 [ @xmath18 and @xmath20 ] the conductivities are much more ( and unsystematically ) sensitive to a change in @xmath1 , showing the existence of a direct band gap in the case of @xmath107 ; and @xmath135 while @xmath152 for the blgsls with @xmath55 [ @xmath16 shows an impressive dip at the fermi energy corresponding to the lowest finite - energy touching point @xmath132 ( indicated by the arrow ) , for the blgsls with @xmath56 the effect of this point in the conductivities is rather weaker in the case of @xmath107 and almost invisible in the case of small @xmath1 [ red solid curve for @xmath147 in @xmath18 ] .",
    "we would like to recall that except the finite - energy touching points identified at @xmath3 there are also the finite - energy touching points located at @xmath129 which should certainly affect the dos and the conductivity behaviors .",
    "we have studied the energy band structure of the blgsls with zero - averaged periodic @xmath0-function potentials ( arranged along the @xmath30-direction ) within the framework of the four - band continuum model , using the transfer matrix method . in the band structures obtained an analysis has been focused on the touching points between adjacent minibands which produce a certain effect on the transport properties . for the zero - energy touching points at @xmath114 claimed before we were able to derive the dispersion relation .",
    "the dirac - like double - cone shape of the dispersion obtained provides that these zero - energy touching points could be really referred to as the dirac points . on the other side",
    ", the group velocity shows that the dispersion may be either isotropic or strongly anisotropic , depending on the potential strength .",
    "we have also noted that the direct band gap can be opened in the energy spectrum of only the blgsls with large enough potential periods ( @xmath66 ) .    from the finite - energy touching points we are able to exactly identify those located at @xmath157 .",
    "it was shown that in the vicinity of the finite - energy touching points identified the dispersion is direction - dependent in the sense that it is linear or parabolic in the @xmath29- or @xmath131-direction , respectively .",
    "additionally , numerical calculations show that the value as well as the sign of the `` electron''- and the `` hole''-masses in the parabolic dispersion in the @xmath131-direction may be very differently varied , depending on the periodic potential parameters .",
    "the touching points at zero- as well as finite - energies may find themselves reflected in the oscillating behavior of the density of states and then the conductivities which have been calculated for blgsls of different potential parameters .",
