    "when two objects in close proximity are illuminated by a light source an optical force is exerted on each of them , whose sign can be either attractive or repulsive depending on the geometry of the objects and of the optical mode in which light propagates .",

    "note that this non - monotonic behavior has a completely different origin from the one reported in  @xcite .",
    "there , a pair of linear waveguides were considered instead of slab ones , and the change of sign of the pressure for the antisymmetric te mode was due to edge effects because of the confinement in the @xmath9 direction ."

    "<S> we study the electromagnetic force exerted on a pair of parallel slab waveguides by the light propagating through them . </S>",
    "<S> we have calculated the dependence of the force on the slab separation by means of the maxwell  stress tensor formalism and we have discussed its main features for the different propagation modes : spatially symmetric ( antisymmetric ) modes give rise to an attractive ( repulsive ) interaction . </S>",
    "<S> we have derived the asymptotic behaviors of the force at small and large separation and we have quantitatively estimated the mechanical deflection induced on a realistic air - bridge structure . </S>"
