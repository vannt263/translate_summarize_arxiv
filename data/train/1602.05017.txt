    "since jaffe  @xcite suggested the possible existence of tetraquarks and dibrayons in qcd , based on the one - gluon exchange color spin interaction , multi - quark systems have been explored in various models and searched for experimentally over several decades .",
    "attempts to find a stable multi - quark systems have been made by many researchers using the chromomagnetic model based on the color spin interaction .",
    "for example , for the x(3872 ) , which by now is widely believed to be a @xmath2=@xmath3 state , hogassen  @xcite suggested that it could be a tetraquark state with a strong mixing of the color octet - octet component of the two quark - antiquark pair within the color spin interaction .",
    "silvestre - brac systematically classified dibaryons consisting of light quarks within the flavor su(3 ) symmetry  @xcite and those containing two different types of heavy quarks  @xcite : these papers have discussed the stability of the multi - quark system and their relation to the hyperfine splitting .",
    "the dynamical problem of studying the stability of the multi - quark system has been studied mainly using the variational method with a nonrelativistic hamiltonian , including the confinement and hyperfine potential .",
    "the ground states of @xmath4 systems with l=0 , have been extensively calculated with the harmonic oscillator bases in ref  @xcite .",
    "calculations based on the simple gaussian spatial function have been made in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite to study the stability of @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( q= @xmath6 or @xmath7 ) system respectively .",
    "two of us  @xcite have also introduced the correlation between quarks in the gaussian spatial function to investigate its effect on the stability of @xmath5 ( q= @xmath6 or @xmath7 ) system .",
    "in addition to these variational methods , a powerful tool , using the hyperspherical harmonic basis functions , have been developed in ref .",
    "@xcite to solve the four - body problem in the tetraquark .",
    "the stability study in the dibaryon sector has also been pursed with several other models@xcite . for dibaryons containing light quarks only",
    ", the h - dibaryon is expected to be the most stable state as the color spin hyperfine splitting is most attractive , even compared to the two @xmath8 baryons . while the model study based on the goldstone exchange interaction cast some doubt on the existence of the h - dibaryon  @xcite , recent results from lattice",
    "qcd have suggested that the h - dibaryon would be bound for massive @xmath1 mass  @xcite .",
    "also , the h - dibaryon was found to be bound in a chiral constituent quark model calculation  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to find the color @xmath0 isospin @xmath0 spin states in the su(3 ) flavor symmetry broken case appropriate for the dibaryon containing two strange quarks with s=0 that is compatible with a symmetric spatial wave function , and then calculate the mass of the dibaryon by using the variational method , with the color - spin hyperfine potential introduced in ref .",
    "in particular , by going through the systematic construction of the color @xmath0 isospin @xmath0 spin states in general , we find the corresponding state for the symmetry broken case of flavor su(3 ) .",
    "lastly , we search for the stability of the h - dibaryon in the flavor symmetric limit of su(3 ) as a function of the pion mass . through this work , we will be able to verify if a compact h dibaryon exists in the symmetry breaking case or the symmetric limit of su(3 ) within the given hamiltonian .",
    "if the recent lattice result of stable h dibaryon in the massive pion case turns out to be valid , our result strongly suggests that the state should be a hadronic bound state and/or loosely bound molecular state .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first present the hamiltonian , and calculate the mass of both baryon octet and decuplet to determine the fitting parameters of the model , and construct the spatial wave function of the dibaryon in section ii . in section iii",
    ", we construct the color @xmath0 isospin @xmath0 spin states in both the flavor su(3 ) symmetric and broken cases , establishing the relation between the two cases .",
    "we show the numerical results obtained from the variational method in section iv .",
    "finally , we summarize the results in section v. the appendices includes some details of the calculations .",
    "to investigate the stability of dibaryon , we adopt the following nonrelativistic hamiltonian that contains the confinement and hyperfine potential for the color and spin interaction . @xmath9 where @xmath10 s are the quark masses , @xmath11 the color operator of the @xmath12th quark for the color su(3 ) , and @xmath13 and @xmath14 the confinement and hyperfine potential , respectively . for the confinement potential , we take half - linearising potential and coulomb potential as follows : @xmath15 here , the first term comes from the perturbative one - gluon exchange , and the second confining part will more likely give stability to the dibaryon and other multi - quark system compared to taking a linearly rising potential but will not change the main result .    for the hyperfine potential , we take the potential to be dependent upon spin interaction as follows : @xmath16 here , @xmath17 is the distance between interquarks , @xmath18 , and both @xmath19 and @xmath20 are chosen to depend on the masses of interquarks , given by , @xmath21 the hyperfine potential splits the baryon octet as well as baryon decuplet masses .",
    "moreover , in the heavy quark mass limit @xmath22 , the functional form of the hyperfine potential in eq .",
    "( [ eq - hyperfine ] ) approaches @xmath23 @xmath24 . by introducing the additional parameters in eq .",
    "( [ eq - hyperfine2 ] ) , one is able to reproduce the experimental observation that the mass differences between psudoscalar and vector meson for @xmath25 states decrease slower as a function of the masses than that given by the inverse mass relation given in eq .",
    "( [ eq - hyperfine ] ) .    in the hamiltonian ,",
    "the fitting parameters have been chosen to reproduce the experimental values of both the baryon octet and decuplet masses using the variational method and typically used constituent quark masses .",
    "the fitting parameters are given in table  [ fitting - parameter-1 ] .    .",
    "parameters fitted to the experimental baryon octet and decuplet masses .",

    "the resulting mass difference between the h - dibaryon and two @xmath8 bayrons are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] as a function of the pion mass .",
    "first , it should be noted that when @xmath28 is reduced to @xmath29 , the mass difference decreases to below 170 mev , which is smaller than that of the realistic case given in table vi .",
    "this result is consistent with the hyperfine interaction becoming larger as discussed in the previous section . on the other hand , as one increases the pion mass , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] , it is found that the mass difference between the h - dibaryon and two @xmath8 baryons increases monotonously .",
    "this seems to be a consequence of the overall weakening of the hyperfine interaction due to the prefactors proportional to the inverse quark masses .",
    "the wave function is also becoming more compact as can be seen from fig.[fig-2 ] which makes the contribution from the additional kinetic term larger .",
    "hence , one can conclude that even in the flavor su(3 ) symmetric limit , there is no stable compact h - dibaryon for a wide range of pion mass .",
    "but to probe a possible molecular bound state , further input in the hamiltonian and trial wave function would be needed .    ) between the h - dibaryon and two @xmath8 baryons as a function of the pion mass in su(3 ) limit .",

    "for the dibaryon containing two strange quarks with s=0 , such as , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 , we have constructed the flavor @xmath0 color @xmath0 spin state both in the flavor su(3 ) symmetric and breaking cases appropriate for the symmetric spatial wave function , satisfying the pauli principle .",
    "we showed that the possible dibaryon states could be classified in terms of the symmetry property of young tableau .",
    "it is found that the symmetry breaking of flavor su(3 ) reduces the fully antisymmetric states in flavor su(3 ) into the color @xmath0 isospin @xmath0 spin states in flavor su(2 ) .    in order to investigate the stability of the dibaryon",
    ", we adopted the nonrelativistic hamiltonian , including confinement and hyperfine potential , and calculated the mass of the dibaryon , by using the variational method .",
    "we conclude that there are no compact bound dibaryons states that are stable against the strong decay into two baryons in both the symmetric and symmetry breaking limit of flavor su(3 ) .",
    "further improvements in the potential as well as more sophisticated spatial trial wave function are needed to probe largely separated two baryon molecular bound state .",
