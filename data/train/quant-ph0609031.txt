    "the quantum mechanics of classically chaotic few - degrees of freedom systems has become an intensively studied in the field of `` quantum chaos '' @xcite .",
    "one key feature is quantum localization , i.e. the localization of the quantum wavefunction while the corresponding classical distribution shows diffusion @xcite . in periodically driven systems ,",
    "this effect has primarily been studied in the kicked rotor , e.g. @xcite , and in the rydberg atom in a sinusoidal electric field , e.g. @xcite . for both systems ,",
    "quantum localization is closely related to anderson localization in transport in disordered systems @xcite .",
    "one signal of this analogy are strong fluctuations in the quantum system for different observables when varying some external parameter .",
    "a third system experimentally and theoretically studied is the periodically kicked rydberg atom ( e.g. @xcite ) , i.e. a hydrogen like atom prepared in a high - lying state and subjected to a sequence of ultra - short impulses . in a recent publication , we showed the existence of quantum localization in the positively kicked rydberg atom @xcite , i.e. the hydrogenic system with the initial state prepared in a highly elongated quasi - one dimensional state localized on one side of the nucleus and the periodic impulsive momentum transfer @xmath3 pushing the electron away from the nucleus .",
    "the classical phase space of this system is globally chaotic with all tori destroyed for arbitrarily small @xmath4 , and the classical survival probability decays algebraically , @xmath5 , with @xmath6 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : psurk ] and @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , by following the time - dependent system up to a few thousands of kicks we could show both the quantum suppression of classical ionization and the `` freezing out '' of the wavefunction , the hallmarks of quantum localization .",
    "several issues remained open , however .",
    "they include 1 ) the origin of a slow , yet noticeable , decay of the localized states , 2 ) the dynamical role of high harmonics ( up to infinity ) present in the system , and 3 ) the properties of strong fluctuations present in the localization regime .",
    "in the following paper we address these issues .",
    "we identify two characteristic time - scales ( `` break times '' ) in this system .",
    "in addition to the localization time @xmath7 , where quantum and classical dynamics begin to differ from each other due to universal destructive interferences , there is a second break time @xmath8 where localization is broken . beyond @xmath8 , a second cross - over",
    "occurs where the classical dynamics becomes more stable .",
    "this second cross - over in the kicked atom is related to the presence of non - classical photoionization .",
    "in the next section , sect .",
    "[ sec : meth ] , we describe the method used in our studies and in sect .  [ sec : psur ] we show that quantum localization in the kicked rydberg atom is transient . strong fluctuations in the survival probability as a function of frequency for fixed times are studied in sect .",
    "[ sec : fluctuations ] and in the last section ( sect .",
    "[ sec : summary ] ) a summary is given .",
    "the hamiltonian of the one - dimensional kicked rydberg atom is ( in atomic units ) @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the hydrogen hamiltonian and @xmath11 the position of the electron .",
    "@xmath4 and @xmath12 are the strength and the period of the train of kicks , respectively .",
    "we will use the number @xmath13 of kicks and time @xmath14 interchangeably .",
    "the restriction to a 1d model in the present context is necessary since the study of the long - time limit in 3d is currently computationally not feasible .",
    "our previous studies for up to @xmath15 kicks have shown that the 1d model can reproduce essential features of the 3d problem . for a more detailed discussion of the relation between the 1d model and the real 3d dynamics , see @xcite and references therein . in the case",
    "@xmath16 , i.e. the kicks directed away from the nucleus , the classical phase space is void of stable islands and the effect of quantum localization has been shown to set in within a few hundreds of kicks @xcite . in the opposite case",
    "@xmath17 stable islands persist allowing for survival of rydberg states both classically and quantum mechanically , referred to as stabilization @xcite .",
    "the unidirectional kicks build up an average field @xmath18 .",
    "hence , the time - periodic hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamdelta ] ) can be decomposed into the time - independent stark hamiltonian @xmath19 plus an infinite series of harmonics of equal strength , @xmath20 in this paper , we will highlight the influence of the higher harmonics @xmath21 , their presence distinguishing our system from the rydberg atom driven by a microwave field .",
    "for the `` positively kicked '' rydberg atom with @xmath16 ( i.e. @xmath22 ) the stark hamiltonian possesses a potential barrier with maximum at @xmath23 and @xmath24 resulting in a finite number of quasi - bound states and a continuum . to keep the stark hamiltonian invariant , i.e. the average field fixed ,",
    "we vary @xmath25 and @xmath4 such as to keeping the average field @xmath26 fixed .    to calculate the long - time evolution of the quantum system we represent the period - one time - evolution operator @xmath27 in a basis @xmath28 defined by @xmath29 by means of the pseudo - spectral method @xcite .",
    "dirichlet boundary conditions are applied at @xmath30 and @xmath31 . solving the eigenvalue equation @xmath32 yields the time - dependent wavefunction in terms of floquet states @xmath33 as @xmath34 with @xmath35 .",
    "a masking function in @xmath11 is introduced to avoid spurious reflections at @xmath36 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "for the low frequencies used in this paper , we apply the masking operator three times per period .",
    "the convergence of the wavefunction obtained is tested both by varying @xmath36 and by comparison with direct solutions of the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( i. e. without facilitating the floquet states @xmath37 ) as described in @xcite .    for later reference",
    "we introduce scaled units , denoted by the subscript @xmath38 .",
    "they leave the classical dynamics invariant and are defined by @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the principal quantum number ( action ) of the initial state @xcite .",
    "note that the transition energy due to to absorption of one photon @xmath44 , is _ not _ scaling invariant .",
    "one measure to study quantum localization is the survival probability , defined as @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the projection operator onto bound hydrogenic states .",
    "the underlying picture is that transport along the energy axis towards the continuum is considered to be the equivalent of conductance in disordered systems @xcite .",
    "correspondingly , suppression of energy absorption from the pulse sequence and , thus , suppression of ionization is identified as localization in a purely chaotic system or stabilization when the classical phase space is mixed .",
    "the classical @xmath47 is obtained by the classical trajectory monte carlo method ( ctmc ) with a micro - canonical ensemble to represent the initial state @xcite .",
    "the classical phase space ( for @xmath16 ) is fully chaotic without any tori left intact .",
    "we show an example for the survival probability in fig .",
    "[ fig : psurk ] .",
    "the classical @xmath47 for times larger than @xmath48 kicks decays algebraically @xcite , @xmath49 with @xmath6 .",
    "both the time @xmath48 and the factor @xmath50 are only weakly dependent on the parameters of the field ( @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) .",
    "by contrast , the quantum survival probability @xmath53 displays a very different and much more complex behavior .",
    "one intriguing feature is an extreme sensitivity to the driving frequency @xmath51 , especially in the long - time limit ( compare also to the results in e. g. @xcite ) .",
    "the resulting fluctuations in the kicked atom will be studied below in more detail ( see sect .  [ sec : fluctuations ] ) .    for characterization of quantum",
    "( de)localization it is useful to introduce another observable that describes the bound portion of the wave packet . inspired by the relation @xmath54 for bound states , we introduce a mean quantum number as @xmath55 in this equation",
    ", the expectation value is calculated for the portion of the wavefunction residing in the bound subspace .",
    "equation ( [ eq : neff ] ) characterizes the specific position of that part of the wavefunction that remains bound , in particular that remains localized or stabilized near the initial state ( or initial torus ) .",
    "indeed , @xmath56 displays a characteristically different behavior classically @xmath57 and quantum mechanically @xmath58 , both at short times ( fig .",
    "[ fig : neffk]b ) and long times ( fig .",
    "[ fig : neffk]a ) .",
    "the sharp drop of @xmath58 from @xmath59 to @xmath60 at @xmath61 will be analyzed in sect .",
    "[ sect : longtime ] .",
    "the corresponding non - normalized distributions @xmath62 whose mean values are given by @xmath56 are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : ndist ] .",
    "the quantum @xmath63 remains well localized close to the initial state while the time evolution of @xmath64 features a rapid increase of width in the energy distribution and a shift towards increasingly lower energies ( i.e. smaller @xmath65 ) .    , both classically ( a ) and quantum mechanically ( b ) for the same parameters as fig .",
    "[ fig : neffk ] ( data shown for @xmath66 ) . , width=302 ]    note , that classically @xmath65 does not possess a lower bound @xmath67 , as the quantum distribution does .",
    "the fact that the energy distribution can grow to negative values without bound is at the root cause for the algebraic decay .",
    "the probability for crossing the @xmath68 line ( i.e. the @xmath69 line ) in the next time step and thus for reducing @xmath70 decreases as the mean distance to the @xmath68 line as measured by @xmath71 increases with @xmath72 .",
    "we now relate the power - law decay eq .",
    "( [ eq : algebraic ] ) to the motion of @xmath64 away from the threshold .",
    "the classical survival probability for large times is well fitted by eq .",
    "( [ eq : algebraic ] ) with @xmath73 .",
    "the scaled average quantum - number is also well described by a power - law , @xmath74 where the power - law decay is assumed to start at the same time as that of the survival probability and @xmath75 .",
    "the differential form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : algebraic ] ) , @xmath76 can now be expressed by means of eq .",
    "( [ eq : neffpowerlaw ] ) as follows , @xmath77 with @xmath78 . for some cases with stronger average fields ( @xmath79 and @xmath80 ) shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : neffave ] and [ fig : tprobave ] ( where @xmath81 and @xmath82 , respectively ) we find that the power - law for @xmath83 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : neffpowerlaw ] ) , holds with approximately the same constant @xmath84 .",
    "hence , eq .  ( [ eq : powerdiff ] ) is still applicable and the constant @xmath85 has essentially the same value .",
    "we now compare the numerical signatures of quantum localization for intermediary times as seen in @xmath86 , figs .",
    "[ fig : psurk]a and [ fig : tprobave ] , to the signatures seen in @xmath56 , figs .",
    "[ fig : neffk]a and [ fig : neffave ] . in all cases studied , the @xmath87 and a clear discrepancy between the quantum and the classical value can be seen for weak fields and low @xmath43 .",
    "the discrepancy decreases as @xmath88 or @xmath43 increases , i.e. @xmath89 approaches the classical limit , however quite slowly .",
    "the approach to the classical limit appears faster in @xmath86 . here",
    "signatures of quantum localization can only be see for weak fields and low @xmath43 while in the other cases shown , @xmath90 has already reached the classical limit .",
    "we thus conclude that the more locally focused @xmath56 provides stronger signature of quantum localization , i.e. the suppression of diffusion away from the initial state , than the @xmath86 probing the entire bound part of phase space .      we take now a closer look at the short time dynamics for the weak field strength , fig .",
    "[ fig : psurk]b and fig .",
    "[ fig : neffk]b . here",
    "a first surprise appears .",
    "one would , generally , expect @xmath91 and @xmath90 to agree with each other up to the localization time ( or quantum break time , also referred to as ehrenfest time ) @xmath7 .",
    "the present case is non - generic in that the classical phase space distribution remains up to @xmath7 ( @xmath92 kicks ) more localized when one identifies @xmath86 as a measure for localization .",
    "this quantum enhancement of ionization takes place even though the classical @xmath57 moves closer to the ionization threshold while the quantum @xmath93 remains close to the initial vale ( fig .",
    "[ fig : neffk]b ) .",
    "the origin is a true quantum effect : perturbative single photon absorption of high frequency @xmath94 from higher - harmonic components with @xmath95 sufficient to reach the continuum . here",
    "@xmath96    a border for the field strength at which a single kick driving a high - lying rydberg state displays quantum - classical correspondence can be found as follows @xcite : the average classical energy transfer from a kick is @xmath97 this energy transfer can be resolved quantum mechanically if @xmath98 is not smaller than the quantum energy spacing @xmath99 , leading to the critical momentum transfer @xmath100 for @xmath101 , the quantum and classical distributions after a single kick agree all the way up to the threshold @xmath68 since the quantum level spacing decreases as @xmath102 , and a good agreement between the quantum and classical survival probabilities is achieved .",
    "the difference between the classical and quantum distributions for @xmath103 can be understood by considering the dipole limit @xmath104 , for which the transition operator for a single kick , @xmath105 , reduces to @xmath106 in this limit , the quantum transition amplitude is proportional to @xmath4 and the probability is proportional to @xmath107 . by contrast , the classical probability is proportional to @xmath108 implying that the quantum survival probability after one kick is smaller than the classical one @xcite .",
    "physically , this can be understood by considering the fourier transform of a delta kick , @xmath109 indicating a `` white '' spectrum .",
    "the quantum system can absorb ( virtual ) photons of arbitrarily high frequency from the white spectrum accompanied by only a small momentum transfer @xmath110 .",
    "processes with large energy transfer @xmath111 but small momentum transfer @xmath52 are far from the line @xmath112 in the @xmath113 dispersion plane for a quasi - free electron , and thus effectively is inaccessible for a classical momentum transfer process . only for deeply bound electrons with large local orbital momentum , @xmath114",
    ", near the nucleus , with @xmath115 can such processes occur in the classical case .",
    "the density of classical phase space points for the initial state with such high @xmath114 is , however , very small . in the quantum case ,",
    "the high - frequency components in the driving field interact non - locally with the whole initial state leading to an enhanced ionization probability .",
    "this corresponds to dipole allowed transitions .",
    "classical - quantum correspondence is only restored when classical diffusion in phase space dominates the quantum enhancement due to ( virtual ) photon absorption .",
    "for @xmath116 and @xmath66 the corresponding critical fields are @xmath117 and @xmath118 , i.e. the case studied in figs .",
    "[ fig : psurk ] and [ fig : neffk ] are close to the dipole limit .",
    "the important point is that the dynamical role of the high - harmonics spectrum of ( virtual ) photons is responsible for the surprising , non - generic features of the periodically kicked rydberg atom , different from other systems such as the rydberg atom in a microwave field .",
    "this is directly verified by increasing the field such that the scaled momentum transfer @xmath119 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : psurdiff ] .",
    "we show first a case in the transition region ( @xmath120 , @xmath116 ) where still some traces of the non - generic features at short times can still be seen . for larger @xmath43 or larger @xmath88 such",
    "that @xmath121 the quantum - classical agreement for short times is quite well fulfilled while discordance is found only for larger times , @xmath122 .",
    "the short - time dynamics now conforms with the naive expectation of close classical - quantum correspondence for all @xmath123 .",
    "well - known arguments @xcite for the localization time lead to the order of magnitude estimate @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the typical spatial extension of the initial state , @xmath126 the wave length of the initial state , and @xmath127 the mean lyaponov exponent .",
    "@xmath7 is indicated by arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig : neffk]b and fig .",
    "[ fig : neffdiff ] . for @xmath56 , @xmath7 gives a reasonable estimate for the number of kicks up to where quantum and classical dynamics mirror each other .",
    "the situation for the survival probability is more involved : for @xmath128 , eq .  ( [ eq : dpcrit ] ) ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : psurk ] and [ fig : psurdiff]a ) , no agreement between @xmath70 and @xmath90 is found for short times and a break time @xmath7 now defined as the time where @xmath91 gets smaller than @xmath90 due to quantum localization takes on a different meaning .",
    "consequently , this break time is not well described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : taul ] ) .",
    "for the cases with @xmath101 , ( figs .",
    "[ fig : tprobave ] and [ fig : psurdiff]b and c ) we find no clear numerical signatures of localization in @xmath86 .",
    "quantum localization in the kicked rydberg atom is transient . after a large but finite number of kicks ( figs .",
    "[ fig : psurk]b and [ fig : psurdiff ] ) , the quantum survival probability rapidly decreases and at a second cross - over time ( delocalization time ) @xmath8 falls below even the classical value .",
    "simultaneously , @xmath129 drops sharply from values near @xmath43 to 1 ( figs .",
    "[ fig : neffk]b and [ fig : neffdiff]b ) . beyond the cross - over point",
    ", @xmath130 falls to values well below unity inaccessible to quantum mechanics .",
    "there , the residual fraction of the classical phase is `` sheltered '' and continues to decay slowly , i.e. algebraically . by contrast",
    ", the quantum bound - state probability decays exponentially in the long - time limit .",
    "beyond @xmath8 the slow classical algebraic decay `` wins '' over the exponential decay .",
    "this novel scenario is markedly different from the sinusoidal driven rydberg atom , where the quantum transport is bounded from below because of the regular phase space region , or , in a quantum picture , because of vanishingly small transition probabilities to states with low principal quantum numbers @xcite .",
    "the rate of the long - time decay and , thus , of @xmath8 can be estimated from the decay rate of the state @xmath67 due to the high harmonics .",
    "this is the lowest - lying and most stable component of any coherent superposition forming a floquet state .",
    "all frequencies of the driving field eq .  ( [ eq : hamfourier ] ) with scaled energy @xmath94 large enough to couple the stark state having the largest overlap with the @xmath67 hydrogenic state to the stark continuum contribute to the transition probability according to fermi s golden rule , @xmath131 with @xmath132 . both dipole matrix elements @xmath133 and the density of continuum states @xmath134",
    "are numerically obtained by diagonalizing the stark hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamstark ] ) in the pseudo - spectral basis .",
    "summing over all contributions leads to a delocalization time @xmath135 which corresponds to within a factor of two to the lifetime of the most long - lived floquet state with @xmath136 . @xmath137 averaged over an interval in @xmath25 ( @xmath138 ) together with the estimated @xmath8 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : neffave ] . @xmath8 clearly gives a good estimate of the time - scale on which the break - down of quantum localization as seen in @xmath56 takes place .",
    "the estimated @xmath8 also coincide with @xmath90 getting smaller than the classical value ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tprobave ] ) .",
    "we thus attribute the break - down of quantum - localization to the higher harmonics in the driving field .",
    "the breakdown of localization is expected if the ground state @xmath67 is directly coupled to the continuum .",
    "we note parenthetically that an experimental realization would require half - cycle pulses with high - frequency components in the uv region .",
    "work is currently under way on a protocol to produce half - cycle pulses in the atto - second regime @xcite .",
    "we now comment on the decay of the quantum survival probability for @xmath139 and @xmath140 , @xmath116 , seen for intermediate times ( @xmath141 and @xmath142 in figs .",
    "[ fig : tprobave]a and b , respectively ) . here",
    "@xmath143 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : neffave ] ) indicating the localization of the quantum distribution @xmath144 ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig : ndist]b ) . as for @xmath56 , eq .  ( [ eq : neff ] ) , we attribute the decay of the localized bound - part of the quantum wavefunction in the kicked atom to the higher harmonics present in the driving field , directly coupling the wave packet localized close to the initial state with the continuum .",
    "the quantum survival probability shown in fig .  [ fig : psurk ] display strong fluctuations under small variations of the kick frequency .",
    "such fluctuations are a direct consequence of the photonic localization scenario @xcite , to be described in the following .",
    "the observation of localization , i.e. the suppression of ionization , or , equivalently , the freezing out of portions of the wavefunction near @xmath43 , raises the question as to the underlying mechanism in the presence of the harmonic spectrum ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamfourier ] )  ) .",
    "high harmonics can not only directly couple to the continuum , see sect .",
    "[ sect : longtime ] , but they also can lead to sequential excitation through a ladder of intermediate ( quasi)bound states .",
    "this channel is the dominant mechanism for the excitation and ionization by the harmonic driving by the lowest harmonic @xmath51 .",
    "jensen et al .",
    "@xcite have discussed the suppression of the sequential ladder excitation by an harmonic driving as a mechanism for localization ( `` photonic localization '' ) .",
    "it is therefore instructive to extend this approach to the present multi - photon case .",
    "following @xcite we assume quasi - resonant one - photon transitions to dominate the time evolution , i.e. we consider only transition between ( bound ) states with energy differences to the initial state approximately equal to @xmath145 times the fundamental photon energy @xmath146 .",
    "the detunings @xmath147 for the quasi - resonant states @xmath148 form a pseudo - random sequence of numbers .",
    "using the rotating wave approximation and setting @xmath149 , with @xmath150 the expansion coefficient for the @xmath151 quasi - resonant state in the interaction picture , leads to a set of coupled differential equations , @xmath152 with the matrix @xmath153 given by @xmath154 the semiclassical expression for the coupling matrix elements is @xcite @xmath155 with @xmath156 and @xmath157 the main quantum number of the @xmath158 quasi - resonant state .",
    "while for the harmonically driven case @xmath159 only for @xmath160 , the coupling matrix elements for the periodically kicked rydberg atom in the @xmath161 off diagonal are proportional to @xmath162 . due to the randomness of the detunings @xmath163 ,",
    "the matrix @xmath153 is thus a pseudo - random , power - law banded matrix . in random",
    "power - law banded matrices with the elements decreasing as @xmath164 , the eigenstates are ( weakly ) localized for @xmath165 @xcite .",
    "our extension of the model introduced in @xcite on the basis of @xcite thus predicts that the eigenstates for the kicked rydberg atom should be localized .",
    "infering from the numerical observation of quantum localization that the detunings are `` sufficiently '' random , the generalization of the photonic localization scenario appears applicable .",
    "we finally comment on the ( semi)classical border @xmath166 .",
    "increasing @xmath43 from 50 to 200 , the quantum localization for @xmath167 almost vanishes ( figs .  [",
    "fig : neffave]b and [ fig : tprobave]b ) .",
    "this indicates that a delocalization border is present in the kicked atom similar to that found for the harmonically driven system @xcite .",
    "the presence of a delocalization border implies a maximum @xmath43 for the applicability of the photonic localization theory .",
    "detailed studies of this border in the kicked rydberg atom remain to be performed .",
    "we turn now to a quantitative description of the parametric fluctuations of @xmath90 under variation of @xmath51 seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : psurk ] . fig .",
    "[ fig : psurnu ] displays the evolution towards an increasingly complex fluctuation pattern as @xmath13 increases .",
    "the amplitudes of the fluctuations increase by several orders of magnitude .",
    "strong fluctuations in the survival probability have also been found e.g. in the harmonically driven rydberg atom @xcite and in the kicked rotor when subjected to a varying aharonov - bohm flux @xcite or a variation of the kicking frequency @xcite .    in order to characterize the increasingly finer scale on which these fluctuations occur ,",
    "we determine the average distance between adjacent maxima and minima on the frequency scale , @xmath168 . at times smaller than the delocalization time @xmath8 , @xmath169 is rapidly decreasing ( fig .",
    "[ fig : avedist ] ) .",
    "a similar build - up of fluctuations in the survival probability with time is observed for the kicked rotor @xcite . in the very - long time - limit beyond @xmath8 , where the dynamics of the kicked system is governed by the decay of the ground state ,",
    "no further fluctuations are produced but @xmath169 saturates .",
    "it is now tempting to inquire whether the complexity of the fluctuations in the @xmath90 can be described by an approximate fractal dimension . for example , the fluctuations in the kicked rotor in the chaotic regime have been shown to have a fractal structure @xcite .",
    "fractal conductance fluctuations have been predicted @xcite and experimentally found , e.g. @xcite , for the transport through cavities with mixed classical phase space .",
    "a fractal structure has also been found in the survival probability of a system with a mixed phase space @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "a semiclassical explanation based on on a classical power - law decay has been proposed . since the kicked rydberg atom displays classically such a power - law decay even though its phase space is fully chaotic , rather than mixed , a fractal is a conceivable candidate .",
    "for a given `` resolution '' @xmath170 in frequency we calculate the local fractal dimension @xmath171 by means of a variational method @xcite .",
    "rigorously , this value should be independent of @xmath170 . in the present physical context , we are satisfied if @xmath171 is approximately constant over at least one order of magnitude in @xmath170 .",
    "the fractal analysis of the data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : psurnu ] is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fract]a .",
    "since the survival probability fluctuates over many orders of magnitude , we analyze the logarithm of the data . after more than @xmath172 kicks ,",
    "a plateau starts to develop , the width of which reaches almost two orders of magnitude for larger @xmath13 . the value of @xmath173 on the plateau increases with @xmath13 up to about @xmath174 .",
    "the process of increasingly finer rescaling is transient and stops beyond @xmath175 when @xmath8 is reached . zooming in on a narrow frequency interval for @xmath176 , ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fract]b ) , the plateau value is still is @xmath174 , but the width of the plateau is only about one order of magnitude .",
    "thus , a tendency towards a non - integer dimension can be found in the positively kicked rydberg atom .",
    "the value is weakly dependent on the number @xmath13 of kicks for which the fractal analysis is made and appears to approach @xmath174 .",
    "it is now instructing to compare this value with the semiclassical prediction @xcite based on the power - law decay with exponent @xmath177 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : psurk ] ) of the classical survival probability @xmath47 , @xmath178 .",
    "the value for @xmath179 is remarkably close to the plateau value found from the fractal dimension analysis .",
    "we thus conclude that the onset of a self - similar fluctuation pattern can be observed with a dimension close to the semiclassical prediction derived from the classical power - law decay .",
    "we note that this process is transient in that the finest scale for the fluctuations is determined by the time @xmath8 beyond which the most stable bound state decays .",
    "we have studied the long - time limit of quantum localization of the positively kicked rydberg atom , involving clear signatures of a quantum suppression of classical ionization .",
