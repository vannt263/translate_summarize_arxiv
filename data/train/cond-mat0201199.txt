    "we see that the two approaches agree in simple geometries ( one or two interfaces ) but show noticeable discrepancy when three or more interfaces are present .",
    "this gives an example of a physical system where quasiclassical technique fails to give quantitative description with its expected accuracy @xmath276 .",
    "as we understand it , the failure of the quasiclassical theory occur when classical trajectories form closed loops ( interfering paths ) after sequential reflection and transmission accompanied by electron - hole conversion .",
    "this gives additional support to the point of view of ref.@xcite that the derivation of the quasiclassical technique is possible only under the assumption of a simply connected topology , tree - like , of classical trajectories .",
    "the main goal of this paper has been to demonstrate the existence of noticeable deviations from the quasiclassical theory in conditions where one might expect it to give fully reliable results . for this purpose",
    "we have chosen the simplest `` exact '' method , the bogoliubov - de gennes approach , where the superconductivity enters via the mean - field order parameter @xmath277 and scattering due to either impurity or surface roughness is not included .",
    "it is now time to discuss to what extent our results are sensitive to the simplifications .",
    "the truly `` exact '' theory of ( phonon - mediated ) superconductivity , for which the quasiclassical technique is an approximation , is the set of gorkov - eliashberg equations for disorder averaged green s function @xmath278@xcite .",
    "the equation of motion , @xmath279 , contains the operator @xmath280 which has the same structure as the bogoliubov - de gennes hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) , with the order parameter replaced by the anomalous part of the electron - phonon self - energy .",
    "apart from the @xmath281-dependence of @xmath280 , the only qualitative difference is that the @xmath280 has a non - hermitian part coming from the self - energies .",
    "the latter accounts for the impurity and electron - phonon scattering and , correspondingly , for a finite life time of the excitation with a given momentum , @xmath282  the scattering - out time .",
    "due to the similarity of the above operators , the interference contribution to observables obtained with the help of the green s function technique or simple minded mean - field bogoliubov - de gennes equation , would give same results . a finite life time",
    "is the only important feature missing in the bogoliubov - de gennes approach , and below we discuss its role .",
    "clearly , the interference of waves having travelled different paths occurs if only the decay length is not too small compared with the path lengths . by virtue of the optical theorem , the waves corresponding to the ballistic trajectories decays on the distance @xmath283 .",
    "in practice , @xmath284 is controlled by the bulk impurity scattering , so that the loops in fig .",
    "[ loops ] may contribute only if the interlayer distances are less or of order of the impurity mean path .",
    "as far as interface imperfection is concerned , short - range surface roughness is expected to play the role similar to that of the bulk impurity scattering : although the interface reflection becomes partially diffusive , the coherent specular component , with the intensity proportional to the fuchs s parameter @xmath285 , is finite @xcite .",
    "thus , the picture of trajectories as that shown in fig .",
    "[ loops ] remains meaningful as well as eq .",
    "( [ nmc ] ) if corresponding attenuation factors are inserted .",
    "we see that although microscopic roughness and bulk scattering suppress the interference effect , it survives disorder averaging if the disorder is not too strong .    when a long - range roughness is present , that is the layer thicknesses are slowly varying , the global value of the loop contribution in eq .",
    "( [ nmc ] ) averages to zero ( if the thickness modulation exceeds @xmath286 ) . however , the interference of paths forming the loops is sensitive mainly to the local value of the thicknesses , so that the interference effects can be seen in the spatial fluctuations of the local current , which is a measurable quantity . in the quasiclassical theory ,",
    "the roughness would reveal itself only of the thickness modulation is somehow comparable with the coherence length . since the loops are sensitive to variations of geometry on the scale of @xmath286 , their contribution to the fluctuations is expected to be much larger than that in the quasiclassical theory .",
    "we see that the deviation from the quasiclassical theory due to the interference effects , although most pronounced in the idealized model exploited in the paper , are observable in realistic conditions if the disorder is not too strong . after disorder averaging",
    ", the interference contribution is observable if the mean free path exceeds the interlayer distance and the rough interfaces have not too small coefficient of the specular reflection .",
    "detail analysis of the loop contribution to mesoscopic fluctuations is beyond the scope of the paper .",
    "apart from disorder , the interference contribution may be suppressed by energy integration .",
    "indeed , the integration with the fermi - dirac distribution function corresponding to the temperature @xmath58 is equivalent to the matsubara summation , that is energy variable @xmath145 assumes discrete imaginary values , multiples of @xmath287 .",
    "then , the waves decay on the length @xmath288 , and , consequently , the loops contribute to equilibrium properties only if the paths are shorter than the coherence length .    summarizing , we have shown that the quasiclassical technique fails in geometries where classical trajectories form closed loops .",
    "in particular , this happens when it is applied to the josephson multi - layer structure with number of semi - transparent interfaces larger than 2 .",
    "this conclusion does not undermine the conventional quasiclassical technique but only limits its applicability in some special geometries where the interference of classical paths can not be neglected . within the quasiclassical approach , the interference can be incorporated into the theory with the help of the method suggested in ref . .",
