    "blue straggler stars ( bsss ) were first identified as stars brighter and bluer than the main - sequence turnoff in the cluster m3 by @xcite . since then they have been found in all globular clusters that have been surveyed adequately and in many open clusters .",
    "the current leading explanations for the production of bsss involve mass transfer within a binary system or the merger of two stars in a binary , and stellar collisions .",
    "the rate of stellar collisions within a cluster depends on its current structural characteristics ( notably , central density and velocity dispersion ) , and on the collision cross sections of the interacting objects .",
    "the binary star population in a cluster can play a large role in bss formation .",
    "in addition to evolution of a binary via mass - transfer and merger into a bss , binaries have an enhanced collision rate for interaction with other stars .",
    "bsss , being much like newly - created main sequence stars , are also likely to have lifetimes that are comparable to or larger than the timescales on which a cluster dynamically evolves .",
    "the stragglers are thus an easily accessible population of stars that can give us insight into a cluster s dynamical past and the importance of its present structural characteristics .",
    "a large amount of effort has recently been put into seeking a global view of how bss populations vary from cluster to cluster .",
    "@xcite cataloged almost 3000 bsss in the cores of 56 globular clusters based on hubble space telescope ( hst ) observations , and found a significant anticorrelation between the relative frequency of bss and total cluster luminosity , and little or no correlation with other cluster parameters .",
    "although the trend with luminosity is strong , there is a significant amount of scatter ( perhaps by as much as an order of magnitude ) around the trend .    in m3",
    ", @xcite discovered a bimodal distribution of bsss with respect to radius , with separate groups of core and envelope stragglers ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "since then , such distributions have been identified in other clusters ( m55 , @xcite ; 47 tuc , @xcite ; ngc 6752 , @xcite ) .",
    "however , in the low - luminosity cluster palomar 13 @xcite , the frequency of bsss does not increase in the outskirts of the cluster .",
    "the small number of studies of the complete radial distribution of bsss has led us to examine the cluster m5 .",
    "m5 has structural characteristics that are currently very similar to m3 ( see table [ m3m5 ] ) .",
    "as such , m5 provides an interesting test of whether clusters with similar structural properties must necessarily have similar straggler populations .    in  2 , we present the datasets that were used in the identification of stragglers in m5 . in  3 , we present the total sample of stragglers , and in  4 , we compare the m5 sample to those from other globular clusters . in  5 , we discuss the comparison population of horizontal branch ( hb ) stars .",
    "finally , we discuss the size of the straggler population and its radial distribution in  6 .",
    "the photometric data we used in this study were derived from images taken using several ground - based telescopes and hst .",
    "wide - field images in @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 were taken at the cerro tololo interamerican observatory ( ctio ) 4 m telescope , and their reduction has already been described in @xcite .",
    "the images were centered on the cluster core and covered square fields 163 on a side .",
    "we used additional higher resolution images of the cluster core from the canada - france - hawaii 3.5 m telescope ( cfht ) in @xmath1 and @xmath3 .",
    "these images have also been discussed previously @xcite .",
    "the field covered by the cfht images is approximately 22 on a side and is slightly offset from the cluster center , although the center is in the field .",
    "we also made use of several hst datasets .",
    "_ bv _ data were taken from the public online data archive of @xcite .",
    "additional unreduced images in the ultraviolet were taken from the hst archives ( proposal i d : 6607 , p.i .",
    "ferraro . ) .",
    "the uv images were reduced using version 1.1.5b of the hstphot package @xcite , which is optimized for the reduction of wfpc2 images .",
    "the images were preprocessed using the _ mask , getsky , crmask , _ and _ hotpixel _ routines to eliminate saturated , vignetted , and hot pixels as well as those with cosmic ray hits .",
    "if the images in a set were dithered , initial guesses for the pixel offsets relative to a reference frame were taken from wfpc2 associations webpage in order to align the images before cosmic ray rejection .",
    "the _ hstphot _",
    "routine was then used to conduct psf photometry using precomputed psfs .",
    "we used flight - system magnitudes in subsequent analysis of this dataset .",
    "positions derived from hst images were transformed to right ascension and declination using the iraf task _ metric_.",
    "these coordinates were used as the basis for the positions [ relative to the cluster center given by @xcite : @xmath4 presented in later tables .",
    "we attempted to obtain a reliable global bss sample by merging datasets for the core of the cluster ( two hst datasets and the cfht dataset ) with @xmath5 , and the ctio dataset for the outskirts of the cluster @xmath6 .",
    "see table [ cbss ] for an example of the photometry for the candidate bsss .    because there is not a reliable and uniform set of photometry covering all of the stars in the cluster , by necessity we had to pay careful attention to our selection criteria so that the samples in different parts of the cluster are drawn from consistent portions of the cmd . in this section",
    "we focus on the selection of a reliable set of bright blue stragglers separately for the cluster core and outskirts .",
    "photometric data for the stars in the cluster core were matched by sky position .",
    "figure [ fields ] shows the regions covered by the three datasets . because these fields did not completely overlap and different filter combinations were used for each field , the brightness and color information available varied from star to star .",
    "we used selection criteria similar to those used by @xcite in their study of m3 .",
    "bsss were selected from the four cmds shown in fig .",
    "[ corecmds ] .",
    "the ( @xmath7 ) and ( @xmath8 ) hst cmds were the primary choice for bss selection due to the high spatial resolution .",
    "we defined the most reliable `` bright '' bss ( bbss ) sample as stars with @xmath9 or @xmath10 ( see  [ comp ] for the motivation behind these cuts ) .",
    "the ( @xmath11 ) cmd was also used in the selection , but mainly as a secondary check for portions of the field that did not overlap with the ( @xmath12 ) cmd .",
    "we identified a star as a bss if it was selected in both the ( @xmath12 ) and ( @xmath13 ) cmds if the star was covered by both hst fields , or in just one if in a part of the field where the hst observations did not overlap .",
    "reliable faint bsss ( fbsss ) were selected differently for each cmd .",
    "for the ( @xmath7 ) cmd , fbsss were selected if they were significantly bluer ( @xmath14 ) and brighter ( @xmath15 ; @xcite ) than the msto and below the bbss cutoff .",
    "the color cut was chosen to avoid photometric scatter near the turnoff .",
    "fbsss were selected in the ( @xmath13 ) cmd by choosing all of the stars brighter than the majority of the photometric scatter ( @xmath16 ) and below the bbss cutoff , though this is likely to be contaminated by optical blends to some degree .",
    "stragglers in the ( @xmath17 ) cmd were selected if they were brighter than the msto and outside of the scatter .",
    "a faint limit cut of @xmath18 was imposed .",
    "we emphasize , however , that this faint sample was _ not _ used in the main comparisons later in the paper because it is prone to contamination resulting from stars with large photometric errors and optically - blended stars .",
    "bright or faint bsss were only selected from the cfht data ( @xmath19 ) if no data were available from hst photometry because blending effects were noticeable for stars nearest the cluster center .",
    "for the ( @xmath19 ) cmd , fbsss were selected if they were bluer ( @xmath20 ) and brighter ( @xmath21 ; @xcite ) than the msto and below the bbss cutoff .",
    "the candidate fbsss closest to the msto appeared to be within the scatter and were not included , although fbsss could exist in that region . once again",
    ", we emphasize our purpose in tabulating fbsss is simply to identify candidates for future work  we have not included them in the main analysis in this paper .    stars that were not selected as bsss that appear in the cmds in regions that bsss occupy were eliminated based on information from other overlapping photometric datasets . in total , 48 bright bsss and and 47 faint bsss were selected .",
    "the outer region of m5 consists of two ground - based data sets from ctio : one in @xmath1 and @xmath2 and the other in @xmath1 and @xmath3 .",
    "stars were again matched by position , and put on a common coordinate system with the core stars .",
    "the regions covered by the hst and cfht core fields were then removed from consideration . due to photometric scatter in the ground - based data , we only selected stars that were above the bbss magnitude cutoff ( @xmath22 ) used in the core sample .",
    "the bright bsss were then selected in the same manner as the core sample .",
    "a star was considered a bbss if @xmath22 and @xmath23 .    as before ,",
    "stars that appear in the ( @xmath7 ) cmd that were not selected as bbsss were rejected based upon their positions in the ( @xmath19 ) cmd .",
    "the @xmath1 and @xmath3 images were taken under better seeing conditions than the @xmath2 images , and had fewer issues with blended star images .",
    "based on these selections , we identified 11 bbsss outside of our core sample .",
    "faint bsss ( @xmath24 ) were selected after an additional radial cut was implemented .",
    "stars just outside the _ hst _ and cfht fields were still subject to significant crowding effects and to minimize these effects a radial cut ( @xmath25 ) was implemented .",
    "the selection criteria are discussed in more detail in  [ gcomp ] .",
    "only the ( @xmath19 ) cmd was used in the selection of faint candidate bsss due to the noticable blending effects seen in the ( @xmath7 ) cmd even with the radius cut .",
    "a total of 13 fbsss were selected .",
    "the selected bbsss and fbsss are shown in fig .",

    "[ bsspos ] shows the cluster position of the bbsss from the core and outer region samples .",
    "we emphasize again that the fbsss were not used in the analysis below , and are included for completeness .",
    "to make fair comparisons with studies of stragglers in other clusters , we have taken the bsss derived from all the photometry we had available ( as described above ) and applied the photometric cuts described in those studies .",
    "we have also applied the same photometric cuts to samples from single cmds to try to choose bsss in a manner most accurately matching that of the original paper . in this way",
    ", we can minimize systematic errors and gauge possible pitfalls involved in selecting stragglers using information from a single cmd .",
    "@xcite examined m3 using multiple wavelengths [ filters f255w , f336w , f555w ( @xmath2 ) , and f814w ( @xmath3 ) in the core , and @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 in the outskirts ] in order to obtain a global bss sample for the cluster .",

    "to examine the frequency of stragglers , we used the hb and rr lyrae stars tabulated previously by @xcite as a comparison population .",
    "six stars in our core sample of bss were identified as probable blends of hb and rgb stars by @xcite based on their position redder than the blue tail of the hb .",
    "( these stars had hb identification numbers of 107 , 201 , 221 , 250 , 268 , and 276 . ) using ultraviolet data from hst ( with its better temperature sensitivity for the hottest hb stars ) , we find that they are significantly fainter than the hb locus , which makes us confident that they are bright bss , and not blends of hb stars .",
    "one star in our outer region sample ( hb i d number 302 ) was also reclassified as a bss based upon its position redder than the blue tail of the hb in both of the ground - based cmds .",
    "no known rr lyrae stars made it into our bss selections .",
    "the bsss that were mistakenly identified as hb stars by @xcite are an interesting class of bbsss .",
    "the most likely formation mechanism for these stars is stellar collisions for the simple reason that a merger of a close binary star or mass transfer within a binary can not produce a remnant that is massive and luminous enough .",
    "the merger of at least three stars ( resulting from a collision involving a binary and at least one other star ) seems to be the only feasible means of accomplishing this .    finally , we have three stars to add to the list of hb stars in @xcite ( see table [ hbtab ] ) .",
    "star 1 has a proper motion estimate @xcite and was identified as a likely non - member ; however , it was the faintest star in the study and its membership probability is quite uncertain .",
    "it falls near the middle of the blue tail of the hb in our ground - based @xmath43 dataset , and so we consider it likely to be an hb star .",
    "star 2 was mistakenly excluded by @xcite due to a bad @xmath2 band measurement that prevented it from being identified as an hb star .",
    "however , based upon its position in both of our ctio cmds near the tip of the blue tail of the hb , it should be included .",
    "star 3 is close to a bright giant star and its photometry may have been contaminated .",
    "its cmd position in the @xmath43 hst data ( brighter and bluer than the hb ) leads us to believe it is an evolved hb star .",
    "in most clusters in which stragglers have been surveyed , the stragglers have been found to be more centrally concentrated than comparison populations ( such as hb or rgb stars ) .",
    "for example , @xcite showed that the bbsss of m3 were more centrally concentrated than the cluster s rgb stars . in fig .",
    "[ hbkstest ] , we compare the cumulative radial distributions of the 59 total bbsss . ] and the 513 hb stars in the same field @xcite .",
    "the figure shows that the bbsss are _ more _ centrally concentrated than the hb stars , and a kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test gives a probability of 0.0015 that the two samples come from the same distribution .    for the globular cluster m3",
    ", @xcite discovered a bimodal distribution with a centrally - concentrated core population , a sparsely - populated `` zone of avoidance '' , and an outer population .",
    "@xcite attempted to explain the origin of the separate bss populations , suggesting that all bsss are formed via collisions involving primordial binaries in the cluster core .",
    "the bss that forms can be kicked into the outskirts of the cluster if the `` spectator '' star ( in binary - single star collision ) is ejected from the system or if there is sufficient mass loss during the collision to perturb the center of mass .",
    "@xcite also suggest that bsss formed or kicked out to @xmath48 will quickly migrate back into the core via dynamical friction , while those kicked out beyond @xmath49 are effectively `` parked '' in the cluster outskirts .",
    "the two different timescales will naturally give rise to the `` zone of avoidance '' seen in m3 .",
    "since the study by @xcite , similar distributions have been confirmed in a few other massive clusters ( m55 , @xcite ; 47 tuc , @xcite ; ngc 6752 , @xcite ) , while a unimodal distribution was observed in one low - mass cluster ( palomar 13 , @xcite ) .",
    "because m5 has a structure that is quite similar to that of m3 , we can test whether structurally - similar clusters produce similar straggler distributions . according to the values in table",
    "[ m3m5 ] @xcite , m3 and m5 have similar concentrations @xmath50 , while m5 has a 17% smaller core radius @xmath51 than m3 , and slightly smaller half - light radius @xmath52 .    in fig .",
    "[ rbss ] , we compare the radial distribution of our bbss sample with that of @xcite for m3 when scaled horizontally for differences in core radius .",
    "the quantity @xmath53 @xcite is @xmath54 the radial distribution for m5 , like that for m3 , has a bimodal nature , although our field was not large enough to identify where the outer population of bss peaks . scaling by core radius is a natural choice if the distribution is modified by mass segregation of stragglers through dynamical interactions with other cluster stars .",
    "this scaling does indeed cause the distributions to overlie each other in the central regions of the clusters .",
    "nonetheless , we examined alternate ways of scaling the radial distributions to compensate for the small structural differences between clusters .",
    "scaling by half - light radius introduces more uncertainty because the half - light radii are harder to determine ( see the footnote in  [ raddist ] ) . in the case of m3 and m5",
    "though , scaling by half - light radius would be very similar to scaling by core radius .",
    "we also tried using @xmath55 ( derived from king models ) as a horizontal coordinate , although this again did not produce an alignment of the straggler distributions . @xcite",
    "provide additional evidence for a scaling with core radius in their examination of straggler populations in the cores of 8 clusters from hst data , finding that the half - sample radii fell at approximately 1 @xmath51 .",
    "( their samples , however , only included stars within single hst wfpc2 fields of view . )    when the two cluster distributions are scaled with core radius , we find that they agree to within @xmath56 out to @xmath57 .",
    "m5 appears to have a wider `` zone of avoidance '' ( @xmath58 ) than m3 ( @xmath59 ) , and a lower frequency of stragglers there .",
    "both of these facts imply that m5 s structure is somewhat more dynamically evolved ( stars that started farther from m5 s center having been dynamically relaxed to the core ) .",
    "bss radial distributions have only been produced for a handful of other clusters .",
    "figure [ rbss2 ] shows the scaled radial distributions for m5 , m3 @xcite , 47 tuc , and ngc 6752 .",
    "( the distribution for ngc 6752 uses the quantity @xmath60 as a stand - in for @xmath53 . )",

    "@xcite created dynamical models to understand the bss distributions in 47 tuc , finding it necessary to employ two separate populations of bsss : a core population and an outer population , compared to a single core population described by @xcite .",
    "the region @xmath63 ( containing the core and current zone of avoidance ) produced bsss primarily through stellar collisions , which were concentrated to the center of the cluster through the action of dynamical friction .",
    "the region beyond @xmath64 was populated with bsss born in primordial binary systems via mass transfer , and remaining in the cluster outskirts due to the weakness of dynamical friction in the low density environment .",
    "these ingredients can naturally produce zones of avoidance seen in all four clusters in fig .",
    "[ rbss2 ] , although differences in cluster history and current cluster characteristics could leave signatures on the straggler distribution .",
    "@xcite used the timescale for dynamical friction @xcite @xmath65 to predict the radius at which the zone of avoidance should occur , assuming circular star orbits within the cluster , cluster ages of about 12 gyr , typical bss mass @xmath66 of about @xmath67 , coulomb logarithm @xmath68 , and appropriate king models for the structure . using velocity dispersion values @xmath69 given by @xcite , we obtained expected @xmath70 values for m5 ( @xmath71 ) , m3 ( @xmath72 ) , 47 tuc ( @xmath73 ) , and ngc 6752 ( @xmath74 ) that agree nicely with the distributions shown in fig .",
    "[ rbss2 ] .",

    "a k - s test applied to the two lines gives a 40% probablility that the two radial distributions are derived from the same underlying distribution .",
    "the inconclusive nature of the test results mostly from the relatively small number of bright stragglers in m5 and the fact that the largest differences are in the sparsely populated outskirts of the clusters .",
    "because k - s tests are not as sensitive to differences in the tails of distributions , we conducted monte carlo simulations by randomly drawing 58 bbsss ( the size of the m5 sample which spans the m3 sample , @xmath75 ) from the m3 sample ( 114 stars ) .",
    "we looked for trials in which the maximum deviation between the cumulative radial distributions was greater than 0.14 ( the measured deviation between the m5 and m3 samples ) , with the smaller sample having the larger cumulative distribution value . for ten million trials , we found that the frequency of this was 9.5% , which indicates that the m5 distribution is marginally inconsistent with the m3 distribution .",
    "the largest differences between the bbss populations of m5 and m3 are in the `` zone of avoidance '' . in making these comparisons",
    ", we must keep in mind that the ordinates for the two distributions are not identical , and that these tests do not account for the possibility of systematic errors in the independent variable .",

    "so if populations of stars in two different clusters follow the underlying light distributions ( described by an appropriate king model ) , scaling by the core radius should minimize differences in the scaled distributions .",
    "the agreement of the two blue straggler distributions for @xmath83 provides some supporting evidence for this choice .",
    "apart from the radial distributions , the sizes of straggler populations vary from cluster to cluster .",
    "@xcite found that the relative frequency of stragglers , defined as @xmath84 is significantly anti - correlated with total cluster luminosity .",
    "however , the scatter in the anti - correlation discussed by @xcite is evidence of some _ additional _ variation from cluster to cluster . using the comparison sample obtained from our total bss list for m5 ( stragglers selected using all available cmd information )",
    ", we find @xmath85 .",
    "if we select bsss in a manner mimicking that of @xcite , we find @xmath86 .",
    "both of these values are similar to the m5 value ( @xmath87 ) used in fig . 1 of @xcite .",
    "regardless of the exact value , m5 ( and m3 ) fall near the upper envelope of clusters in the trend of log @xmath88 with @xmath89 .",
    "we then examined the global sample of bright stragglers for m3 and m5 .",
    "the global sample for m3 found by @xcite consisted of 114 bbsss with @xmath90 . according to a king model for the cluster",
    ", this radius corresponds to a fractional contained luminosity of 0.697 . to compare the global sample for m3 to that of m5 , we used a global sample selected with the same criteria used by @xcite out to a radius having the same fractional contained luminosity ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "as described earlier , we have also made a strong effort to ensure that our photometric selection criteria matched the ones used for m3 .",
    "our sample contains 82 bbsss , returning a frequency @xmath92 for m5 , compared to @xmath93 for m3 . though m5 is the more luminous cluster , it contains about 20% fewer bright stragglers than m3 .",
    "using a single hst wfpc2 field of view centered on the cores of 8 clusters , @xcite compared the specific frequencies of _ bright _ bss defined as @xmath94 using the 31 bbsss found in our uv sample , we obtain a frequency of @xmath95 for m5 . when the bbsss are selected using the method of @xcite , we find @xmath96 .",
    "these two values for m5 are statistically consistent and give m5 one of the _ lowest _ values of the clusters listed in table 3 of @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that ngc 6752 had a low specific frequency ( @xmath97 ) of bright stragglers , while @xcite found a frequency of @xmath98 for m3 .",
    "the specific frequencies for m5 and m3 do not differ greatly , as was the case for the radial distributions .",
    "this again shows that there is little difference between the two clusters bss populations .",
    "we must keep in mind that even among the clusters examined by @xcite there was a wide range of cluster luminosities represented , so that simple comparisons of specific frequencies could be misleading .",
    "if the brightest blue stragglers are more likely to be produced by collisional processes ( mergers of two or more stars ) , it is worth asking whether the bright straggler frequencies show the same anti - correlation with cluster luminosity that the larger samples of @xcite do .",
    "as @xcite showed , there appears to be a change in the luminosity function of stragglers between the brightest ( @xmath99 ) and faintest ( @xmath100 ) clusters in their sample .",
    "a least - squares fit to the @xmath101 values ( @xmath102 obtained from @xcite ) ( see fig . [ spec ] ) for m5 and the 8 clusters studied by @xcite produces a slope ( 0.28 ) that is significant at the @xmath103 level .",
    "this slope is similar to the average slope seen in fig . 2 of @xcite for total samples in clusters with @xmath104 .",
    "so , with the limited ( in number of clusters and in luminosity range ) cluster sample available at present , the bright stragglers appear to be behaving similarly to the total samples , although if we remove the lowest luminosity cluster ( ngc 288 ) from the list , the fitted slope is only @xmath105 different from zero .",
    "the relative bbss population sizes of m5 and m3 are very similar , as one might expect for two clusters having similar dynamical properties .",
    "their frequency values differ slightly , possibly in part due to the small differences in their total cluster luminosities .",
    "the two clusters may differ in the distribution of their stragglers .",
    "s `` zone of avoidance '' appears to be wider than that of m3 and there is a larger percentage of the stragglers in this zone in m3 than in m5 .",
    "both of these facts are consistent with the idea that m5 s stragglers are more dynamically relaxed than those of m3 , separating the core and envelope stragglers to a greater degree .",
    "as was described years ago by @xcite , multi - wavelength photometry is truly necessary to reliably identify bsss by utilizing cross - checks between the different bands .",
    "the bsss mistakenly identified as hb stars by @xcite are a prime example of this . for clusters with blue hb morphologies ,",
    "the identification of bright blue stragglers is not a trivial matter .",
    "these bsss are of special interest because the brightest ones are likely to be binary star collision products .",
    "the uv bands are of great importance when picking out these bsss because they can most cleanly separate stragglers from the hotter hb stars .",
    "optical colors are simply not color - sensitive enough for the hottest stars .",
    "our results from the comparisons of the bss populations confirm that m5 and m3 have similar dynamical characteristics .",
    "both of their radial distributions show bimodality , implying distinct core and envelope populations .",
    "when scaled for differences in core radius , the two distributions largely overlie each other  the agreement is best in the core , though m5 appears to have a larger `` zone of avoidance '' and a secondary frequency peak that is farther from the cluster center .",
    "the bss frequencies for the two clusters are quite similar as well .",
    "the slightly smaller frequency values for m5 are consistent with m5 s higher total luminosity when considering the anti - correlation between frequency and cluster luminosity mapped out by @xcite .",
    "while cluster luminosity seems to have been established as a primary predictor of straggler frequency , there does appear to be significant scatter that results from another source .",
    "future work to understand this scatter should include an investigation into other clusters with luminosities comparable to m3 and m5 , such as m2 , m13 , m53 , and ngc 5824 . in the clusters examined by @xcite , there is approximately a factor of 3 difference in frequencies among clusters with integrated luminosities similar to m5 .",
    "since these clusters have large total straggler populations , it would also be possible to examine the radial distibutions in maximum detail .",
    "we would like to thank undergraduate tom jackson for his contributions to a preliminary study of m5 s stragglers .",
    "jackson was a participant in the nasa college summer research program at northwestern university .",
    "this work has been funded through grants ast 00 - 98696 and 05 - 07785 from the national science foundation to e.l.s . and m.b .",
