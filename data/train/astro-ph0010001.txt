    "at least some part of the population of narrow - line radio galaxies ( nlrgs ) are believed to harbor quasars in their central region , hidden from direct view .",
    "this has been demonstrated by polarimetric observations of these radio galaxies .",
    "the observations have shown that the radiation from some of these nlrgs is linearly polarized with the e - vector perpendicular to the radio - jet axis .",
    "also the permitted lines are broad in the polarized flux spectra @xcite , the same as in seyfert 2 galaxies @xcite . in some cases , the broad components are discernable in total flux , but highly polarized and of low equivalent width .",
    "the polarization degree often goes higher in the uv than in the optical due to the lower dilution by the unpolarized star light from the host galaxies",
    ". therefore optical , rest - uv polarimetric observations of high - redshift radio galaxies have been done extensively @xcite .",
    "the imaging polarimetry has shown that the rest - uv image is typically elongated along the radio axis , and polarized perpendicular to this elongation @xcite .",
    "recently , this has been also domonstrated by uv imaging polarimetry of nearby radio galaxies @xcite .",
    "thus , all these facts fit well into the unified model of radio - loud quasars and radio galaxies @xcite .",
    "the scattered light , together with the anisotropic nuclear radiation along the radio axis , has provided the explanation of at least some part of the alignment between the uv morphology and radio jet structure in @xmath3 galaxies ( called the alignment effect ; di serego alighieri et al .",
    "1989 ; see mccarthy 1993 for a review ) .",
    "in the two @xmath4 galaxies observed , however , the aligned light is unpolarized starlight ( 4c41.17 , dey et al . 1997 ; 6c1909 + 722 , dey 1998 ) .",
    "while the scattering origin for much of the uv radiation has now been proven in several nlrgs , the nature of the scattering agents , i.e. hot / warm electrons and/or dust grains , still remains to be debated .",
    "the imaging polarimetry and long - slit polarimetry have revealed that the size of the scattering region in some nlrgs is of a few kpc to @xmath5 10 kpc scale @xcite .",
    "this is one or more orders of magnitude larger than found in seyfert galaxies ( e.g. capetti et al .",
    "this large size implies a rather enormous mass for the scattering gas in the nlrgs if the scatterers are electrons @xcite .",
    "therefore dust grains are preferred a priori to be the scattering agent , because of their much better scattering efficiency ( i.e. , larger scattering cross section per unit gas mass ) .    to address the nature of the scattering regions and environment around the hidden quasars in the radio galaxies ,",
    "we need a wide wavelength coverage for the polarized flux distribution . in this paper",
    ", we present uv spectropolarimetry of low - redshift narrow - line radio galaxies obtained by the hubble space telescope ( hst ) . combining the data with other optical / ir polarimetric data from the literature , we seek the general characteristics of the observed scattering regions . in  [ sec - obs ] ,",
    "we describe our observation and data reduction process , and the results are presented in  [ sec - res ] .",
    "we discuss the nature of the scattering region in ",
    "[ sec - disc ] , and summarize our conclusions in  [ sec - conc ] .",
    "we adopt @xmath6 km / sec / mpc and @xmath7 throughout this paper .",
    "three low - redshift nlrgs 3c234 , 3c321 and 3c327 ( @xmath8 ) were observed with the faint object spectrograph ( fos ) onboard hst after the installation of costar .",
    "we have used its spectropolarimetry mode with the grating g270h on the blue detector to observe @xmath9  region at @xmath10 2.1  per diode .",
    "we also have taken ( non - polarimetric ) spectroscopy data with g190h on the red detector to observe the far - uv region @xmath11  at @xmath10 1.4  per diode .",
    "for these two wavelength regions , the red detector has a higher sensitivity than the blue detector , but we used the blue detector for the former observation because of lower geomagnetically induced image motion and lower instrumental polarization .",
    "the data are summarized in table [ tab - data ] .",
    "the targets were acquired using the 3-stage peakup procedure of the fos . from the target acquistion data ,",
    "we have estimated the location of our observing aperture ( @xmath12 diameter ) to the accuracy of @xmath13 , using the hst / foc images @xcite .",
    "the results are shown in figures [ fig - aper - a]@xmath10[fig - aper - c ] .",
    "unfortunately , we missed the brightest region for 3c321 .",
    "the data were calibrated in a standard way , as described in the hst data handbook ( 1997 ) .",
    "the calibration procedures are ( 1 ) correction for dead diodes , ( 2 ) background subtraction , ( 3 ) flat - field correction , ( 4 ) wavelength calibration , ( 5 ) conversion to absolute flux . several pixels with unusual noise are excluded by comparing several exposures with the same configuration . for the g270h / blue spectra",
    ", we have adjusted the zero point of the wavelength @xcite .",
    "the heliocentric radial velocity correction was applied . to obtain the stokes parameters from the calibrated flux dataset ,",
    "we have generated our own script on idl described briefly below .",
    "for this process , we did not use the standard software in stsdas because of its inadequate handling of the spectropolarimetric data .",
    "the fos spectropolarimetry technique is very similar to that in ground - based instruments .",
    "the waveplate is used with a wollaston prism , which splits a beam into ordinary and extraordinary rays .",
    "these o - ray and e - ray are observerd almost simultaneously ( 10 seconds in turn ) .",
    "spectra are taken with the waveplate rotated by 22.5 interval .",
    "we obtained our spectra with four different waveplate positions .",
    "the signal to noise ratio was not good enough to determine stokes @xmath14 parameters with this four - position observation .",
    "this prevented us from correcting for the instrumental polarization induced by costar , since this correction needs the circular polarization information .",
    "however , the effect is expected to be small ( @xmath15% level uncertainty in polarization degree for our wavelength range ; storrs et al .",
    "1998 ) compared to our relatively large statistical errors in polarization .",
    "therefore we calculated the stokes parameters @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 ( after allowing for the wavelength shift between o - ray and e - ray ; storrs et al .",
    "1998 ) simply from the relations @xmath19 assuming that the circular polarization is zero ( for each intensity @xmath20 , subscripts denote waveplate positions and superscripts denote o - ray / e - ray ; @xmath21 is the retardation of the waveplate ) .",
    "we did not perform any correction for the costar - induced instrumental polarization .",
    "the circular polarization in our objects is expected to be very small .",
    "after this , the q and u are corrected for the variation of waveplate axis over the wavelength and converted from instrumental coordinates to sky coordinates @xcite .",
    "we have first subtracted the background using the canonical values from the standard calibration pipeline .",
    "the fos background counts basically correlate with the geomagnetic position of the hst at the time of the observation @xcite .",
    "the canonical background values in the pipeline are derived from this information , but there could be some residual counts . for the far - uv observation with g190h , there are unilluminated pixels and we have used them for the scattered light subtraction and additional background subtraction adjustment . with g270h ( spectropolarimetric data ) , however , there are no unilluminated pixels available .",
    "we found that with the canonical background subtraction , the blue side of the g270h stokes @xmath16 spectra did not match well with the red side of the g190h spectra for each object .",
    "therefore we scaled the canonical background for g270h spectra to match with the g190h spectra .",
    "the scaling factors were found to be 1.35 , 1.38 , and 1.45 , for 3c234 , 3c321 , and 3c327 , respectively .",
    "these scaling values are rather large , suggesting that the canonical backgrounds were systematically underestimated for these observations .",
    "the scattered light in our g270h spectra is expected to be small since our objects are rather red @xcite .",
    "we have confirmed the color of our objects by calculating the optical flux in our observing aperture using the archival wfpc2/f702w images .",
    "the geomagnetic image motion could affect the spectra , but in our case this effect is expected to be small because our observing aperture was @xmath12 , where the height of diodes is @xmath22 and the typical uncorrected geomagnetic motion is @xmath23 , and because real - time onboard corrections were done .",
    "also the telescope pointing was good in our observations , judging from the available jitter data .",
    "note that this background scaling , or background itself , essentially does not affect the unnormalized stokes parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 systematically , thus does not affect the polarized flux and position angle of polarization systematically ( but affects @xmath24 , through @xmath16 ) .",
    "the @xmath17 and @xmath18 are essentially obtained from the difference of the o - ray and e - ray [ see eq.([eq - iqu ] ) ] , and these two rays are observed almost simultaneusly as described above .",
    "the fos background counts originate mainly from high energy particles hitting the photocathode or detector itself , and are considered to reside equally in o - ray and e - ray spectra .",
    "figures [ fig - pol-3c234 ] @xmath10 [ fig - pol-3c327 ] show the results of our spectropolarimetric observations .",
    "the far - uv spectra are given in figures [ fig - fuv-3c234 ] @xmath10 [ fig - fuv-3c327 ] .",
    "the errors are calculated from the statistical error of the raw counts . due to the aperture miscentering for 3c321",
    ", we could not detect polarization for this object ( fig.[fig - pol-3c321 ] ) . for 3c234 and 3c327",
    ", we have detected high polarization ( @xmath25 % level ) .",
    "for these objects , the uv polarization is roughly constant over the observed uv wavelength range .",
    "we also show the properties of the emission lines seen in our spectra in table [ tab - line ] , determined by fitting a gaussian for each line . for the line widths , the instrumental width of 1 diode has been subtracted in quadrature . for 3c234 ,",
    "the broad components are seen in the total flux at @xmath261549 and ] @xmath261908 . for the former , there seems to be two distinct broad components with fwhm of @xmath27 km sec@xmath28 and @xmath29 km sec@xmath28 .",
    "we show the line fitting results in figure [ fig - line-3c234 ] .",
    "the simultaneous fit of the continuum ( power law ) and several lines ( gaussians ) resulted in having the continuum slope of @xmath30 , but this could be uncertain due to the low s / n in the short wavelength side . if the real continuum is redder as in the longer wavelengh side ( see fig.[fig - pol-3c234 ] , though note the possible contributions ) , the extremely broad component of the line could be even broader and would have a larger flux .",
    "for the broad component in the ] line , there might also be two components , but the smaller ew and the blend with the ] line prevented us to do a reliable two - component fit . for 3c327 , we see broad @xmath262800 line in the total flux .",
    "we tentatively determined its fwhm to be @xmath31 km sec@xmath28 , although there could be contributions from broad emission lines in this region .    as we described in ",
    "[ sec - obs ] , we have increased the amount of the background subtraction for the spectropolarimetry data , compared to the nominal background .",
    "the background subtraction affects only @xmath16 , and does not have an influence on @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( unnormalized stokes parameters ) .",
    "the object counts are lower at shorter wavelength which have lower sensitivity , so the fraction of the background counts are larger there . therefore , larger background subtraction results in smaller @xmath16 and larger @xmath24 at the shorter wavelength .",
    "this changes the total flux level and its spectral shape rather significantly in 3c321 and 3c327 since the background fraction in these objects was rather high .",
    "however , the overall wavelength dependence of @xmath24 does not change significantly compared with the relatively large error in @xmath24 .",
    "the polarized flux is not influenced , as the @xmath17 and @xmath18 do not change .",
    "table [ tab - comp ] compares our spectropolarimetric results with the previous observations .",
    "slight discrepancies in position angles ( pas ) are possibly explained through the differences in observing aperture sizes .",
    "we show the polarization extracted at different positions and apertures from the hst uv imaging polarimetry data @xcite taken with f320w filter ( @xmath32 ) in figures [ fig - imgpol-3c234 ] and [ fig - imgpol-3c327 ] . in 3c234",
    ", the nucleus has an extension to the south east on @xmath33 scale .",
    "( also the nucleus seems to be slightly elongated to the north east on @xmath34 scale .",
    "the psf through the f320w filter is known to be elongated , but this elongation direction is different from the one seen in the nucleus . ) this extension seems to be polarized differently from the nucleus , though the values for this component in figure [ fig - imgpol-3c234 ] are only suggestive since this foc image is pre - costar data .",
    "the optical imaging polarimetry data of @xcite show similar pa distribution ( see their fig.5f ) .",
    "our fos observing aperture has possibly excluded some portion of the south - east component .",
    "this would explain at least partly the slight difference in pa between our fos data and larger aperture data .",
    "for 3c327 , the nucleus is double , or the image suggests the existence of two scattering cones .",
    "these two features have slightly different polarization . our fos aperture was centered on the brighter one , and the polarization extracted only for this feature is consistent with our fos result .",
    "as described in @xcite , the exposure time for one of the polarizer images of 3c327 was uncertain , but the uncertainty is probably less than 5 seconds ( r. jedrzejewski , private communication ; we adopted the same exposure time as in hurt et al .",
    "the resulting uncertainty of the measured polarization in figure [ fig - imgpol-3c327 ] is less than the quoted statistical error .",
    "conversely , this is supported by the agreement with our fos result .    from the resolved polarized flux distribution in the imaging polarimetry data , we can derive the physical extent of the scattering region .",
    "we have extracted the image with a certain width along the elongation direction for each object .",
    "the stokes parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 are calculated with the polarization reference axis perpendicular to this elongation .",
    "the extracted regions ( direction and width ) are indicated in figures [ fig - aper - a]@xmath10[fig - aper - c ] , and we show the @xmath35 and @xmath36 distributions in figures [ fig - pf - a]@xmath10[fig - pf - c ] .",
    "the figures indicate that the polarized fluxes from these radio galaxies are extended from a sub - arcsecond to arcsecond scale , which corresponds to a few kpc to 10kpc ( though the size for 3c234 would be lower , since the imaging polarimetry data are pre - costar ) .",
    "this is one or more orders of magnitude larger than the spatial scale of the scattering region seen in seyfert galaxies .",
    "the sizes are summarized in table [ tab - scatsize ] .",
    "in this section , we discuss the observed polarized flux spectra comparing these with the observed quasar continuum .",
    "we refer to the typical quasar continuum shape as @xmath37 where @xmath38 at @xmath39@xcite .",
    "some papers find steeper typical slopes , in part because of the apparent luminosity dependence @xcite , and sometimes because the so - called 3000  bump is not removed . also of course since the underlying continuum is sometimes convex , the rest wavelength intervals are important . we note that , however , even if the intrinsic optical and uv spectral shape ( @xmath40 ) is slightly redder , such as the composite spectra of @xmath41 @xcite , this essentially does not affect our conclusions below",
    ". the spectral shape could be even redder at shorter wavelength @xcite , but this basically is not relevant here since we mainly discuss the polarized flux of wavelength longer than @xmath42 , except for the discussion of high - redshift radio galaxies (  [ sec - disc - other ] ) .",
    "our uv spectropolarimetry shows that the continuum polarization is roughly independent of wavelength , and as we will see in  [ sec - disc - ind ] , the polarized flux shape from the uv to optical is similar to or redder than the typical quasar continuum .",
    "these might suggest that the dominant scattering is being caused by electrons ( plus reddening ) , rather than by dust grains .",
    "its feasibility , however , is quite low . as we have seen in the previous section ,",
    "the scattering regions in these radio galaxies are rather large .",
    "the previous work on the distant high - redshift nlrgs has shown that the scattering regions are even larger , @xmath2 kpc scale ( 3c256 : dey et al .",
    "1996 ; 3c265 : di serego alighieri et al .",
    "1996 , tran et al . 1998 ; 3c324 : cimatti et al .",
    "this fact favors dust grains as the dominant scatterers .",
    "first , the scattering cross section per hydrogen atom , @xmath43 , for dust grains in the optical or uv is two or three orders of magnitude larger than thomson scattering cross section in the interstellar medium of our galaxy ( see below for more specific values ) , and may not be too different in the scattering region in these radio galaxies .",
    "dust should survive at these large scale regions , and large dust masses are observed to exist in many high - redshift radio galaxies and quasars @xcite . secondly , even if the amount of dust is a few orders of magnitude less than that in our galaxy and the electrons are to take the role as the dominant scatterers , the large sizes of the scattering region observed imply enormous masses for the scattering gas @xcite .",
    "this argument is summarized as follows .",
    "the scattered luminosity @xmath44 is described by , using the nuclear luminosity @xmath45 , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the hydrogen density , @xmath48 is the radial distance from the nucleus , @xmath43 is again the scattering cross section per hydrogen atom , and @xmath14 is the volume .",
    "the integral is taken over the whole scattering region , assuming an optically thin case .",
    "let us define a geometrical factor @xmath49 as @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a characteristic size for the scattering region .",
    "this factor depends on the geometry of the scattering region but is of order unity . using this factor",
    ", we can relate the total number of hydrogen @xmath52 to the scattering fraction @xmath53 as @xmath54 here , we rewrote the scattering fraction as @xmath55 ( which means that it corresponds to the average optical thickness of the scattering medium , @xmath56 , multiplied by the covering factor of the medium with respect to the central illuminating source , @xmath57 , but we are not assuming any particular geometry of the scattering region here ) .",
    "thus the mass for the scattering gas @xmath58 necessary to achieve a certain scattering fraction is written as @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the thomson scattering cross section .",
    "note that the gas mass surrounding the nucleus could be larger than @xmath61 by a factor of several or more , since we are considering only the gas illuminated by the nucleus and there should be more unilluminated gas ( e.g. outside of the ionization cone ) .",
    "we have adopted the value of 0.01 as a typical value for the scattering fraction @xmath55 . for our three objects , we can compare their uv luminosity with that of the quasars with the same low - redshift range and with the same radio lobe power .",
    "those differ from our objects mainly in orientation alone according to the unified model .",
    "the uv polarized flux luminosity of our three objects is log @xmath62 ( erg sec@xmath28 hz@xmath28 ) = @xmath63 at @xmath64  and their radio power at 178mhz is log @xmath65 ( erg sec@xmath28 hz@xmath28 sr@xmath28 ) = @xmath66 , while the 3c quasars with @xmath67 and with the same radio power range have log @xmath45 = @xmath68 at @xmath69  ( we have taken absolute magnitudes from veron - cetty & veron 2000 and converted them with @xmath70 ) . if we think that the intrinsic polarization is less than @xmath10 50% , the scattered light would be larger than the polarized flux at least by a factor of @xmath71 .",
    "therefore the scattering fraction 0.01 is a representative approximation .",
    "consideration of reddening would make the scattered luminosity of these radio galaxies brighter , so would make @xmath58 even larger .",
    "thus , if the scatterers are electrons @xmath72 , a large mass is implied .",
    "on the other hand , only a relatively small mass is necessary if the dominant scatterers are dust grains : the scattering cross section @xmath43 for dust grain per h atom is @xmath73 at @xmath14 and @xmath74 at @xmath75  in our galaxy , assuming the column density of h atoms per @xmath76 = @xmath77 @xmath78 @xcite , @xmath79 , and albedo of 0.5 .",
    "the recombination - line luminosity provides another argument , if we consider the line luminosity from the scattering region .",
    "let us consider a simple case of a scattering region with density @xmath47 , volume @xmath14 , and volume filling factor @xmath80 , so that we have the amount of gas @xmath81 and the emission measure @xmath82 . with the scattering region size @xmath51 and the amount of the gas @xmath52 from the above estimation [ equation ( [ eq - mscat ] ) ]",
    ", we can estimate the h@xmath83  luminosity @xmath84 to see if we predict the right amount with a reasonable value of @xmath80 ; @xmath85 we simply adopted the volume of @xmath86 , and the h@xmath83 emissivity @xmath87 for @xmath88k .",
    "the density is estimated as @xmath89 for our three radio galaxies , h@xmath83 luminosity is of the order of @xmath90 erg sec@xmath28 ( table [ tab - scatsize ] ) . if we assume dust scattering , the observed line luminosity can be easily accomodated with a small value of @xmath80 ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "the density will be of order @xmath92 @xmath93 in this case .",
    "on the other hand , when assuming electron scattering , to avoid the overprediction of h@xmath83 luminosity , the volume filling factor should be close to unity , or not be too far from unity , which is quite surprising.the density will be of order 1 @xmath93 in this case .",
    "this situation can be summarized as follows . in the electron case , for which a large amount of gas is implied",
    ", the gas has to be spread over the entire volume to have smaller density for suppressing the line emission . in the dust case , for which a smaller amount of gas is needed ,",
    "the gas should be squeezed into a smaller effective volume to have higher density to get the same line emission .",
    "higher @xmath94 of @xmath95 k , as will be discussed in  [ sec - disc - ind ] ( but not too high to avoid smearing out the scattered broad line completely ) , could reduce @xmath84 by about a few orders of magnitude .",
    "one possibility for electron scattering is a hot diffuse volume - filling gas without much line emission , possibly surrounding the narrow - line region , though this still suffers from the large mass problem .      the mostly constant polarization and the polarized flux spectrum no bluer than typical quasars would lead us to consider electron scattering , but the feasibility arguments above would suggest dust grains to be the dominant scatterers . below we attempt to summarize the property of dust scattering , for the interpretation of the polarization data of radio galaxies .",
    "the most robust way to investigate the wavelength dependence of the scattering process is to look first at the polarized flux spectrum with a wide wavelength range , then look at the total flux spectrum considering the possible diluting components .",
    "these diluting components , such as stellar radiation and nebular continuum , usually have no influence on the polarized flux spectrum .",
    "the polarized flux from the scattering process is the product of the incident spectrum and the polarizing efficiency @xmath96 , where @xmath96 is the scattering efficiency @xmath97 times the intrinsic polarization degree @xmath98 which is the degree of polarization of the scattered light from the scattering process . in optically thin dust scattering , @xmath97 is simply proportional to the scattering cross section @xmath43 which has a rather strong wavelength dependence , and @xmath98 has a moderate wavelength dependence .",
    "we have to compare the product of these two with the ratio of the observed polarized flux spectrum to the typical quasar continuum shape , @xmath37 where @xmath99 .",
    "for the optically thick case , @xmath97 will be significantly different , which will be discussed in the next section .",
    "we focus on optically thin cases in this section .",
    "the scattering cross section of the extreme case is the rayleigh scattering limit where @xmath100 .",
    "this is for the case of very small particles . for galactic dust",
    ", the scattering cross section has been investigated through the observations of reflection nebulae ( witt & gordon 2000 and references therein ) .",
    "it generally increases with decreasing wavelength , but its wavelength dependency changes with wavelength range , as shown in figure [ fig - crosssec ] .",
    "the scattering cross section is proportional to @xmath101 in the near ir ( @xmath102 ) and its spectral index gets flatter with shorter wavelength . in the optical ( @xmath103 )",
    "it is roughly proportional to @xmath104 . in the uv",
    ", the _ extinction _ cross section has a bump at @xmath10 2200 , but this feature seems to be purely in absorption , not in scattering @xcite .",
    "this 2200feature is weak in the lmc ( misselt , clayton , & gordon 1999 and references therein ) , and it is absent in the star - forming bar of the smc ( gordon & clayton 1998 and references therein ) and in starburst galaxies @xcite . in this uv range ( @xmath105 ) , while the extinction cross section for galactic dust generally goes up rapidly at wavelengths shorter than the bump ( although it depends on the sight line : calzetti , clayton , & mathis 1989 ) , the wavelength dependence of the scattering cross section seems to become somewhat flatter with @xmath106 , though the empirical work on the albedo at @xmath107  varies for different objects and thus it is still poorly understood @xcite . for the smc , the extinction rapidly goes up roughly with @xmath108 , but no empirical work on the scattering cross section exists .",
    "several authors have done theoretical calculations of dust properties . in an early paper ,",
    "@xcite inferred the composition and size distribution of the dust grains that reproduce the galactic extinction curve .",
    "@xcite calculated the scattering and polarization properties for this population of dust .",
    "recently @xcite have calculated the polarization properties using updated dielectric functions .",
    "these latter two calculations suggest that the polarization of the scattered light in a single dust scattering process , @xmath98 , is moderately wavelength - dependent . in @xcite ,",
    "the maximum polarization , which is achieved when the scattering angle is around 90 , is approximately flat at about 30 @xmath10 35% ( versus 100% for electron scattering ) in the uv / optical region of @xmath10 1700@xmath109 7000 .",
    "to longer wavelength , it goes up to @xmath110% at @xmath111 . to shorter wavelength in the far uv",
    ", it also rather rapidly increases reaching @xmath110% at 1000 .",
    "the region around 2200  would be highly uncertain because these theoretical calculations produce the 2200  enhancement in the scattering cross section , as opposed to the observational result by @xcite , though this is the only empirical result at present . at smaller or larger scattering angle ,",
    "the polarization degree becomes smaller , but the overall wavelength dependence is similar . we obtain the polarizing efficiency @xmath96 by multiplying the scattering cross section and this polarization degree @xmath98 . for the region of the most interest in this paper , @xmath112 , @xmath98 seems to be approximately constant , so the shapes of the scattering efficiency @xmath97 and polarizing efficiency @xmath96 are almost the same , and thus @xmath96 is proportional to roughly @xmath104 for the galactic dust , if there is no 2200  bump in the scattering cross section as observed by @xcite . for the smc dust , @xmath96 would be roughly proportional to @xmath108 . for the shorter wavelenth ( far - uv ) , @xmath96 would be slightly bluer , and for the longer wavelength ( near - ir ) , it would be somewhat redder .    some observational results actually show this blue polarizing efficiency or blue scattering efficiency .",

    "this could be close to the case of rayleigh scattering , but with a rather large uncertainty .",
    "none of other radio galaxies is known to show this type of behavior .",
    "what if the dust clouds are optically thick ? generally ,",
    "if we see a scattering wall or slab of dusty gas which is optically thick at all wavelength regions , the wavelength dependence of the scattering efficiency would essentially correspond to the albedo ( not the scattering cross section ) of the scattering medium . for galactic dust ,",
    "the albedo is observed to be mostly flat in the uv - ir wavelength regions . in this sense",
    ", its scattering efficiency curve would be rather similar to electron scattering .",
    "but in reality , we will observe the scattering region through various viewing angles , and this would cause a wavelength dependence of the scattering efficiency especially when the clouds are only moderately optically thick . also , in the case of radio galaxies , the scattering region would not be uniformly optically thick as a whole in terms of the unification of radio galaxies and quasars , since otherwise we would not observe any quasars .",
    "the optically thick regions should be localized , i.e. , the scattering region as a whole should be clumpy as actually observed in 3c321 , and it is each of these clumps which could be optically thick .",
    "then , the general property of this scattering region can be approximately derived from that of a single spherical scattering blob .",
    "the calculation of the scattering properties of such a blob has been implemented by @xcite using the monte carlo method .",
    "figure [ fig - dustblob ] reproduces their result for the dust scattering with albedo = 0.5 and scattering asymmetry parameter @xmath49 = 0.56 ( forward - throwing ) , which are for a representative case for uv / optical dust scattering @xcite .",
    "the symbols in figure [ fig - dustblob ] are the scattered flux per unit solid angle for a certain viewing angle @xmath126 ( which is the scattering angle at the blob ) with unit incident flux , multiplied by @xmath127 .",
    "it corresponds to the scattering fraction for a blob , integrated assuming isotropic scattering .",
    "since the single dust scattering process is forward - throwing , the scattering dusty blob is also forward - throwing , and this is true even for the case of rather large optical thickness .",
    "( we multiplied the scattered flux by @xmath127 to show an _ apparent _ scattering fraction , which we would infer from observations because viewing angle is usually unknown . )    when the viewing angle @xmath126 is small ( forward scattering case ) , we will see the strong forward - scattered light through a significant amount of extinction . when viewed edge - on ( @xmath128 )",
    ", this extinction effect becomes smaller .",
    "when @xmath126 is large ( backward scattering case ) we will see relatively weak back - scattered light with a smaller amount of extinction , and the scattered light will be saturated with large optical thickness , just like seeing a thick wall . in all these cases ,",
    "the scattered flux first increases proportionally to the increase of the scattering optical thickness of the blob ( denoted here as @xmath129 , where @xmath130 is albedo and @xmath131 is extinction optical thickness for the diameter of the blob ) .",
    "then it starts to have some effective amount of extinction ( @xmath132 ) , which increases with the blob optical thickness ( @xmath133 ) .",
    "for relatively small blob optical thickness , the scattered flux can be approximated by @xmath134 ( similar expressions have been used by other authors , e.g. cohen et al .",
    "more specifically , the data points , say @xmath80 , in figure [ fig - dustblob ] for relatively small @xmath131 can be approximated by @xmath135 where @xmath136 the phase function @xmath137 is given in @xcite .",
    "the factor 2/3 added to @xmath131 represents the effective thickness of the sphere of diameter @xmath131 .",
    "the factor @xmath138 corresponds to the effective fraction of extinction of the scattered light .",
    "the dotted lines in figure [ fig - dustblob ] illustrate that we can fit the calculation results with only one parameter @xmath138 for relatively small @xmath131 ( up to @xmath10 2.0 ) .",
    "this effective extinction fraction @xmath138 is close to unity but decreases with increasing viewing angle ( the adopted values for the fit in fig.[fig - dustblob ] are 0.9 , 0.6 , 0.4 for @xmath139 ) , since we will see the light with a shorter path inside the blob for larger viewing angle .    in terms of the observations , this @xmath131 dependence of",
    "the scattered light corresponds to the wavelength dependence of the scattering efficiency since the optical thickness of the blob is proportional to @xmath140 .",
    "it initially follows the form of @xmath141 .",
    "however , for larger optical thickness , which corresponds to shorter wavelength observation , the scattered flux will not decrease exponentially , as illustrated in figure [ fig - dustblob ] .",
    "the fit described above fails at larger optical thickness .",
    "this is because for larger @xmath131 the effective extinction optical thickness @xmath132 does not grow proportionally to @xmath131 , but instead grows slower : the parameter @xmath138 [ eq.([eq - ext - eff ] ) ] for a given viewing angle is not actually constant , but decreases with @xmath131 ( we only see more foreground part of the blob where extinction is smaller ) . thus , once the blob becomes opaque for the observing wavelength , its scattering efficiency becomes flat or decreases to the shorter wavelength but not exponentially .",
    "this means that the wavelength dependence of the optically - thick scattering efficiency is bluer than that of foreground screen extinction , for which we expect an exponential cut - off at the shorter wavelength .",
    "we note that in the optically thick case with the galactic dust , the scattering efficiency and polarizing efficiency will have some dip across the 2200 , since @xcite showed that the albedo has a dip at the 2200 , based on the enhancement in absorption and non - enhancement in scattering across the 2200  feature .",
    "the scattered light ( and polarized flux ) will decrease around 2200because of this absorption enhancement . in the smc or starburst galaxies ,",
    "the 2200  feature does not show up in the extinction , so the albedo would be flat across the 2200  region . there would be no feature in the scattered light from such dust grains .",
    "the observations of radio galaxies are still not definitive on this issue . in our spectrum of 3c234",
    ", we do not see any feature . in the spectrum of 3c327 ,",
    "the feature , if it exists at all , is not clear .      to investigate the nature of the scatttered light for the three radio galaxies in our program ,",
    "we combine our uv polarization data with the previous optical / ir polarimetry data in the literature .",
    "the hst uv imaging polarimetry is available in @xcite for all three objects .",
    "the polarized flux spectra from uv to ir are shown in figures [ fig - comp - a ] , [ fig - comp - b ] , and [ fig - comp - c ] .",
    "for 3c234 , we have plotted ground - based large - aperture polarimetry data ( see table [ tab - comp ] ) and spectropolarimetry data ( tran et al .",
    "the latter is a @xmath142 slit observation with the seeing @xmath143 and thus the absolute flux is lower , so we have scaled the data to fit the large aperture data with the same wavelength regions ( of course this is only meaningful if the scattering mechanism is the same ) .",
    "although our uv polarized flux with the @xmath144 aperture could be missing some part of the whole polarized flux , as indicated by the slight pa rotation ( see  [ sec - res ] ) , its flux level matches that from the large synthetic aperture photometry of the uv imaging polarimetry data @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig - comp - a ] , all fluxes have been corrected for the small galactic reddening @xmath145 ( ned ; based on schlegel et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the optical polarized flux has been found to be very red compared to the typical quasar continuum ( tran et al .",
    "1995 ) : we measure the spectral index @xmath83 ( @xmath115 ) between h@xmath83and h@xmath146  to be @xmath147 from tran et al .",
    "data ( for @xmath148  to avoid any possible influence of broad h@xmath83  line ) .",
    "also , the balmer decrement in the polarized flux is large ( 7.3 ; tran et al . 1995 ) .",
    "these facts , as well as the large pa@xmath83/h@xmath83ratio for the broad components in the total flux , have been interpreted to be due to a significant reddening of @xmath149 ( carleton et al .",
    "1984 ; hill et al . 1996",
    "; tran et al . 1995 ; we have summarized the observed slope and line ratios in table [ tab - scatsize ] . )",
    "however , a simple screen reddening does not explain our uv polarized flux observation .",
    "the polarized flux spectrum can be fitted with a power law down to the uv , if we exclude 2600  @xmath150  region to allow for the possible so - called 3000  bump : @xmath151 for the optical - uv from the large - aperture optical data and our uv data , and @xmath152 for the uv only . a significant amount of dust screen ( such as the one to redden the optical spectrum from @xmath37 to @xmath153 ) should absorb the uv greatly so that the resulting spectrum would have an exponential decrease toward the uv .",
    "thus , a dust screen is unlikely to be the cause of the red continuum of 3c234 .",
    "we note that the redness of the optical continuum and balmer decrement in the broad - line radio galaxies and radio - loud quasars have been found to have a correlation , which has been interpreted to be due to reddening @xcite .",
    "the observed values for the optical polarized flux of 3c234 actually fit into this correlation ( see fig.16 in baker 1997 ) .",
    "but our uv data for 3c234 is not compatible with this reddening interpretation because of the lack of a cutoff in the uv .",
    "also , note that the reddening inferred in the quasar colors must show an exponential uv cutoff , if a dust screen is present .",
    "if the polarized flux continuum of 3c234 is without a significant reddening , this would mean that the broad h@xmath83  and h@xmath146  lines in 3c234 have a different reddening .",
    "the possibility of broad lines having different reddening from continuum has been discussed by some authors ( e.g. baker 1997 ) .",
    "alternatively , the balmer decrement could be intrinsically large in 3c234 : the optical depth effect will make the balmer decrement larger ( e.g. kwan and krolik 1981 ) . in this case , to explain the large pa@xmath83/h@xmath83  ratio observed , we might have to consider a different component in the ir .",
    "we will discuss this later below .",
    "as for the scattering mechanism in 3c234 , the red , apparently no - reddening continuum suggests that an optically - thin dust scattering is not a dominant contributor .",
    "otherwise , the incident continuum has to be redder than the observed one , which would be unlikely . on the other hand",
    ", an opaque dust scattering would explain the observation .",
    "if the viewing angle is rather small , it will make the continuum redder but without an exponential decrease , as we have seen in the previous section .    as described in ",
    "[ sec - res ] , however , an extremely broad component with fwhm of @xmath29 km sec@xmath28 is observed in the line of our uv total flux spectrum ( fig.[fig - line-3c234 ] ) , in addition to an ordinary broad component .",
    "we have inspected the h@xmath83region in the polarized flux spectrum of tran et al . , and tentatively identify an extremely broad component of similar width ( or even broader ) .",
    "these extremely broad lines could be intrinsic to the broad line region of 3c234 , but also could be due to scattering broadening by hot electrons with @xmath154 k. thus some part of the scattered light might be from electrons .",
    "we note that the gas mass implied for electron scattering case would be less of a problem for 3c234 , because the observed scattering region is rather compact .",
    "now we discuss briefly the ir polarized flux .",
    "we have calculated the k band polarized flux using the polarization data at 2  with @xmath155 aperture @xcite and total flux data with @xmath156 aperture @xcite .",
    "the polarization data from @xcite is consistent with the former , but the absolute flux seems to be lower by a factor of @xmath10 2 due to the smaller aperture ( @xmath157 ) as described by them .",
    "we tentatively do not use the h band data from @xcite , since the h band total flux ( @xmath158jy ) shows a rather strange dip by a factor of about 2 between the j band and k band flux ( 2050 @xmath159jy and 5500 @xmath159jy , respectively ) .",
    "note , however , that there are emission line contributions in j and k bands , such as @xmath2610830 and pa@xmath83 .",
    "having these in mind , the observed k band polarized flux forms almost the same spectral shape as the optical ( @xmath160 over the ir to the optical ) . typical quasar continua actually turn up at around 1  and have a steeper spectral shape in the ir with @xmath161 ( or @xmath162 ; neugebauer et al .",
    "1987 ) than in the optical .",
    "apparently , the ir continuum polarized flux of 3c234 could be consistent with no or little reddening .",
    "however , the large pa@xmath83/h@xmath83ratio would not be consistent with this . again",
    ", the broad lines would have different reddening than the continuum , or alternatively , the large ratio might be suggesting that another polarized component is coming in in the ir , which could be highly - reddened scattered light from the inner region , or a dichroic polarization component @xcite . note that the pa does not change in the ir from the optical .    in summary , for the scattering mechanism in 3c234",
    ", we infer that opaque dust scattering with a rather small viewing angle might be playing a role , though some part of the scattered light could be from electrons .",
    "the hybrid case of dust - scattered and electron - scattered light seems to be realized actually in nature .",
    "it could be the situation exactly in ngc 1068 for a large aperture @xmath163 , including the ne dust knot , observed in the uv @xcite , where the uv polarized flux is significantly influenced by the dust scattered light . in the case of cygnus",
    "a , the polarized h@xmath83 line is extremely broad @xcite , but the line is much narrower @xcite .",
    "therefore , scattering agents could be different in these two wavelength regions , and electron scattering might be contributing at least at @xmath164 , though the galactic - reddening corrected flux ratio of these two lines could be consistent with optically - thin dust scattering @xcite .      for 3c321 ( fig.[fig - comp - b ] ) , we have combined the optical / ir polarization data by @xcite with the foc uv imaging polarimetry data .",
    "the nucleus of 3c321 consists mainly of two components , separated by @xmath165 .",
    "the @xmath113 aperture polarimetry of @xcite seems to be centered on the brighter , se component .",
    "@xcite , however , give the integrated polarization for the whole of both two components , so we have implemented the synthetic @xmath113 aperture polarimetry centered on the se component , the result of which is shown in table [ tab - comp ] and figure [ fig - comp - b ] .",
    "the galactic reddening is @xmath166 ( ned ; based on schlegel et al .",
    "the centro - symmetric pattern of the position angle distribution of the optical polarization does not seem to be disturbed by the galactic interstellar polarization @xcite .",
    "the spectral shape of the polarized flux with the @xmath113 aperture corrected for the galactic reddening is @xmath167 ( @xmath168 ) .",
    "the spectropolarimetry by @xcite shows that the optical polarized flux spectrum has @xmath169 , and the polarized flux continuum of @xcite is consistent with this result . @xcite have taken optical spectropolarimetric data with a slit across these two nuclei ( @xmath170 extraction size ) , and showed that the polarized flux spectrum integrated is of @xmath121 , while the balmer decrement seems to be not too large .",
    "the scattering region of 3c321 is very extended , so the results of polarimetry will be different for different size and location of the apertures and seeing conditions . nevertheless , these results suggest that , overall , the wavelength dependence of the polarizing efficiency is apparently quite flat or slightly blue in the optical to the near - uv .    what is the nature of this polarized flux ? at the central region , there is evidence for reddening in the morphology of the optical image taken by hst ( see fig.2 in hurt et al .",
    "1999 ) where a dust lane is clearly seen .",
    "also , the narrow line components have been shown to be reddened at the central region : from h@xmath171/h@xmath146 , tadhunter et al .",

    "therefore , the polarized flux from this central region could also be reddened .",
    "the significant part of the polarized flux , however , is coming from the outer region . using the uv imaging polarimetry data of @xcite , we have compared the polarized flux from the central @xmath176 region with that from the outer region within the @xmath113 diameter masking the central @xmath176 .",
    "they are found to be approximately of the same amount .",
    "therefore , the possible explanation of the flat or slightly blue polarizing efficiency would be that the reddened polarized flux from the central @xmath177 region is compensated by the blue optically - thin dust scatterered light from the outer region",
    ".    we also compared the polarized flux from the observed clumps ( including the nw component ) with that from the surrounding diffuse gas , and found that they have a comparable amount , though the definition of the diffuse region is somewhat arbitrary and also the data suffer from the abberation ( pre - costar ) .",
    "this polarized flux from the diffuse region would be optically - thin dust scattered light , while the polarized flux from the clumps might be opaque dust scattered light .",
    "the latter would have roughly neutral scattering efficincy if the viewing angle is close to edge - on , which would be expected from the morphology with a dust lane .",
    "however , the possibility of electron - scattering contribution can not be ruled out , aside from the huge mass implied if this is the case for the diffuse extended region .",
    "the spectral shape of the polarized flux is not blue enough to rule it out to be neutrally scattered light .",

    "conversely , we can estimate the lower limit for the mass of an opaque dusty clump from the size scale of the clump ( diameter @xmath218 ) and average column density through the clump ( @xmath219 ) as @xmath220    the possibility for electron scattering , however , still can not be ruled out , aside from the large mass problem .",
    "the extremely broad component ( @xmath1020000 km sec@xmath28 or more ) , seen in the line of 3c234 or possibly in the h@xmath83  lines of 3c234 and 3c321 , might suggest the scattering broadening by hot electrons ( @xmath95 k ) .",
    "if the spatial distribution of these electrons is really extended to @xmath10 10kpc scale and thus have a huge mass , this gas would be collapsing into the inner region in a timescale shorter than the dynamical timescale since the cooling time would be of order @xmath221 yr assuming @xmath222 @xmath93 (  [ sec - disc - elec ] ; see fabian 1989 for the case of larger scale ) .",
    "this would be very important to the galaxy forming process .",
    "the physical origin of this hot gas might be related to the inner cooled and condensed part of the cooling flow seen in clusters of galaxies .",
    "we have presented the results of hst uv spectropolarimetry of low - redshift narrow - line radio galaxies .",
    "we investigated the polarized flux spectrum over a wide wavelength range , combining the uv data with the optical / ir data in the literature . the polarized flux spectrum shape in our sample and in other high - redshift radio galaxies are found to be no bluer than the typical quasar continuum .",
    "this , and apparently no exponential decrease in the shorter wavlength , would suggest that in a lot of cases the dust scattering clouds , if any , would be opaque and thus show a grey scattering efficiency . in the high - redshift galaxies ,",
    "these opaque dust scattering clouds could be proto - galactic fragments inferred to be seen in the hst images .",
    "however , the possibility of the scattering by electrons still can not be ruled out , which might imply a large gas mass surrounding these radio galaxies .",
