    "it is the latest kamland limit on the solar electron anti - neutrino flux  @xcite , in combination with solar neutrino data , including the recent sno salt phase results  @xcite , that ultimately establishes the robustness of the simplest three - neutrino oscillation description of the solar neutrino data  @xcite showing how it is essentially stable even in the presence of the sfp mechanism  @xcite  .",
    "little is known about the detailed structure of solar magnetic fields and several models have been previously used to analyse the sfp conversion .",
    "these solar magnetic field models make different assumptions about the nature ( regular or random ) of solar magnetic fields , their magnitude , location and typical scales  @xcite . according to the dynamo mechanism the solar magnetic field",

    ", we assume that the field resides within the solar convective zone  @xcite .",
    "moreover , in accordance with the present - day understanding of solar magnetic field evolution , the large - scale magnetic field in the solar convective zone is followed by a small - scale random component , whose strength is expected to be comparable to or even larger than that of the regular one .",
    "insofar as the sfp mechanism is concerned , the main difference between random and regular magnetic field scenarios is that the former generally give rise to an enhanced rate of anti - neutrino production , up to two orders of magnitude when compared to the case of regular fields of the same ( average ) amplitude .",

    "this is a good approximation , in view of current neutrino data .",
    "solar neutrino evolution in the presence of a magnetic field involves then only the solar mixing angle where @xmath9 and is described by a four  dimensional hamiltonian  @xcite , @xmath10 where @xmath11 ( @xmath12 is the atmospheric mixing angle ) ; @xmath13 and @xmath14 ; @xmath15 is assumed to be always positive .",

    "( [ kappa ] ) describing neutrino propagation in the framework of different solar magnetic field models .",
    "different approaches have been used in order to describe neutrino propagation in the fluctuating matter density or random magnetic field environments .",
    "since the origin of the media fluctuations is unknown , we stick to the simplest `` white '' noise description , which involves just two parameters : the typical correlation scale and its characteristic amplitude .",
    "the `` delta - correlated '' model described by @xmath80 has been used both for the case of matter density fluctuations  @xcite , as well as random magnetic fields  @xcite .",
    "this choice of correlator has the virtue that it allows for analytical solutions to the neutrino evolution equations .",
    "it suffers from an important limitation , namely that the allowed spatial scales , @xmath6 , of fluctuations should be less than typical neutrino oscillation lengths @xmath81 .",
    "however , it so happens that the strongest conversion effect takes place when these two parameters are comparable  @xcite .    because of this one needs to go at least one step further and consider the so called `` piece - constant '' model . for the case of matter density fluctuations",
    "this has been used in refs .",
    "@xcite and for random magnetic fields it was applied in  @xcite .    in what follows ( sec .",
    "[ sec : simpl - rand - field ] ) we adopt this piece - constant model , whose correlator is described by , @xmath82 in other words , the fluctuation correlation function is modeled as a step - function .",
    "we refer to this as `` simplest random magnetic field model '' .",
    "note that in these models the typical correlation scale is in general a free unknown parameter .",
    "one may go a step further if one has more information about the nature of the assumed fluctuations .",
    "for instance , a detailed analysis of how density fluctuations , in the form of helioseismic waves , can affect the msw neutrino oscillations was introduced in ref .",

    "we give in sec .",

    "these are described by a magnetic field correlation tensor @xmath83 whose specific form will be given below ( eq .  ( [ correl ] ) ) .",
    "as a result the separate dependence on the correlation scale and the amplitude of fluctuations is replaced by a dependence on a specific combination of these parameters , @xmath84 in eq .",
    "( [ fetarenormalized ] ) .",
    "this has the advantage of expressing the final neutrino fluxes in terms of a single effective parameter which varies over a relatively narrow range .",
    "as already mentioned , current views on solar magnetic field evolution suggest that the mean large - scale magnetic field is followed by a comparable small - scale random magnetic field component .",
    "such random small - scale magnetic field is not directly traced by sunspots or other tracers of solar activity .",
    "dynamically , this field propagates through the convective zone and photosphere drastically decreasing in strength .",
    "while we lack a direct reliable observational estimate of its amplitude , one finds that the ratio of the random to regular magnetic field amplitudes may be as large as 50 - 100 , as it is not clear at what stage the dynamo mechanism saturates .",
    "this issue has been very actively discussed in the literature ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the simplest random convective ",
    "zone solar magnetic field model is obtained by imagining that the convective zone consists of a set of correlation cells of volume @xmath85 where the random magnetic field is assumed uniform , fields in adjacent cells being uncorrelated . in this picture",
    "we treat the small - scale random magnetic fields in terms of a single effective scale @xmath6 characterizing the size of the correlation cells .",
    "we also assume that within each cell different magnetic field components transversal to the neutrino trajectory are independent random variables with zero mean value ( for a more detailed discussion see , for example , ref .",
    "that is , a given realization of the random magnetic field along the neutrino path is a stationary random process described by gaussian statistics .",
    "it is also assumed that in order to satisfy divergence - less condition , @xmath86 , the magnetic field strength changes smoothly at the boundaries between adjacent cells .",
    "this simplified model seems reasonable since we do not expect a strong influence of details of the random magnetic field structure near the layers separating adjacent domain cells .    in order to estimate @xmath63 in eq .",
    "( [ eta ] ) we divide the range of integration into a set of equal intervals of correlation length @xmath6 and average over random magnetic fields in each correlation cell , @xmath87 this results in the final equation @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the averaged square of the random magnetic field in the @xmath90-th correlation cell .",
    "we assume that the root mean square ( _ rms _ ) field varies smoothly along the neutrino trajectory .",
    "one therefore clearly sees the cumulative effect characterizing neutrino propagation in random magnetic fields , implied by the sum in eq .",
    "( [ aveta ] ) . for the simple case where all _ rms _ field amplitudes in different cells are equal to some common magnetic field value the above result gets proportional to the number of correlation cells traversed by the neutrino , @xmath91 .",
    "in contrast , for regular magnetic fields the situation is different .",
    "the neutrino to anti - neutrino conversion probability after traversing the convective zone with a constant regular magnetic field of the same amplitude is proportional to @xmath92 that is , what would be expected after passing only one cell .",
    "therefore in the random magnetic field case one obtains a sizable enhancement of the neutrino conversion probability as compared with the case of a constant magnetic field of the same amplitude .",
    "this enhancement is explained by the fact that the random nature of the magnetic field destroys the coherence in the neutrino evolution .",
    "therefore , instead of adding amplitudes one have to add probabilities  @xcite .    finally , in order to take account of the shape of the _ rms _ random field profile we introduce a factor @xmath93 which is @xmath94 for constant _ rms _ field and of the order of unity for other sufficiently wide spatial profiles , e.g. @xmath95 for `` smooth '' profile  @xcite , @xmath96 for triangle profile  @xcite , @xmath97 for kutvitsky - solovev profile  @xcite .",
    "an alternative estimate of typical shape factors comes from the assumption that the magnetic energy density globally follows the approximate solar density profile with the scale height @xmath98 , leading to @xmath99 .    using the above definition of the shape factor one can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ aveta ] ) as @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the maximal value of the transverse magnetic field .",
    "this shows that different random magnetic field models can be effectively characterized by two parameters , @xmath102 and @xmath6 .",
    "a well motivated class of magnetic field models can be considered for which the number of parameters can be further reduced by eliminating reference to the effective scale @xmath6 .",

    "similar as fig .",

    "so the high lma region is ruled out . ]",
    "bounds on @xmath201 for the turbulent magnetic field model described in the text .",
    "the horizontal lines indicate the bounds on solar electron anti - neutrino fluxes from super - k and kamland .",
    "the diagonal dark band shows the limit on the intrinsic neutrino magnetic moment , its width corresponds to our ( kolmogorov ) turbulent magnetic field model uncertainties .",
    "the crossing of this band with the lowest kamland line gives the limit @xmath202  @xmath203 .",
    "for comparison the vertical line indicates the present munu reactor limit . a more conservative and pessimistic limit discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : crit - robustn - bound ] would give the limit indicated by the hatched band . ]",
    "an important issue arises here , namely the robustness of the bounds we have obtained with respect to different possible choices of the scaling law for the turbulent kinetic spectrum . in order to answer this question",
    "we have considered the iroshnikov - kraichnan model  @xcite , characterized by the power law @xmath204 instead of @xmath139 that corresponds to the kolmogorov spectrum .",
    "we have found that , in this case , the anti - neutrino yield is higher by @xmath205% , implying a correspondingly stronger bound on the neutrino magnetic moment . in general , values of @xmath140 lower than @xmath206 lead to the same tendency : the smaller @xmath140 , the stronger limit on the neutrino magnetic moment .",
    "another question which may be addressed is whether different power - laws could be distinguished in future experiments , should solar electron anti - neutrinos ever be measured .",
    "although the anti - neutrino yield is larger for the iroshnikov - kraichnan spectrum than for the kolmogorov one , the expected anti - neutrino spectrum is not significantly different . in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] the predicted anti - neutrino spectra ( normalized to unity ) are plotted both for the iroshnikov - kraichnan and kolmogorov spectra . for comparison",
    "we have also shown the expected electron anti - neutrino spectrum for the random magnetic field case with @xmath176 km and for the kutvitsky - soloviev magnetic field scenario  @xcite .",
    "one can see that there is no essential difference between them .",
    "therefore , if a positive anti - neutrino signal is ever detected , the spectrum shape would not convey definitive information about the turbulent energy spectrum .",
    "in contrast , different @xmath6 values in random field scenario lead to significantly different energy spectrum predictions . this may help in some cases to distinguish these models , but the detailed analysis of this phenomenon is out of the scope of the paper .     predicted normalized electron anti - neutrino spectrum for the mhd turbulent model with kolmogorov ( solid ) or iroshnikov - kraichnan ( dashed ) scaling exponents and the simplest random magnetic field model . for comparison",
    "we also indicate the expectation for the a regular magnetic field model . ]",
    "note that in the framework of our turbulent picture there is no time dependence in the magnetic field correlators , so that the resulting solar neutrino fluxes will have no time variation .",
    "this is a reasonable aproximation since the neutrino data we use are taken over periods larger than characteristic turbulent time fluctuations of solar magnetic fields .",
    "possible neutrino flux variations in the super - kamiokande data have been considered  @xcite .",
    "we note however that in the framework of the spin flavour precession of majorana neutrinos , irrespective of the magnetic field model adopted , the expected variations in the electron and muon neutrino fluxes should not exceed the current electron anti - neutrino flux bound @xmath207 .",
    "therefore time variations are expected to be too small , given the current statistical errors in the solar neutrino data .",
    "we now discuss in more detail the possible weaknesses of the method we have employed to constrain the neutrino magnetic moment in the case of turbulent magnetic fields .",
    "the bound is given from eq .",
    "( [ feta ] ) and depends on @xmath208 .",
    "we have taken @xmath209 km , arguing that this is the size of the granules on the surface of the sun .",
    "one might argue , however , that the scale @xmath158 may be associated with the size of the convection cells which is about a few @xmath210 km .",
    "in such a worse - case scenario the neutrino conversion would be smaller , thus weakening the limit .",
    "however at most this would weaken our bound by a factor @xmath211 due to the mild power dependence 1/3 .",
    "moreover , the size of the largest turbulent eddies , @xmath208 , is still an open question , see for example ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the bound on the neutrino magnetic moment also depends on the shape factor @xmath212 .",
    "such shape factor @xmath165 accounts for the fact that the random magnetic field may not be located in the whole convective zone ( see discussion after eq .",
    "( [ s ] ) ) .",
    "the bound on the neutrino magnetic moment assuming that the shape factor is s=0.5 is a conservative bound and corresponds to the assumption that only 1/4 part of the convective zone is effectively filled by the random magnetic field ( @xmath213 ) .",
    "the strength of the random ( as well as the regular ) magnetic field in the solar convective zone is unknown .",
    "there are different theoretical estimates of its value based on available experimental data . in order to derive our conservative limit on the neutrino magnetic moment",
    "we have used the value 50 kg .",
    "a smaller value , say 20 kg , for the strength of the large  scale regular magnetic field in the convective zone would result in a limit only 2.5 times weaker than the value we obtained",
    ". however we stress that the small  scale random magnetic field is expected to be comparable or even larger than the regular one .",
    "the value of 50 kg for the random magnetic field does not contradict the helioseismic data , in particular the analyses of soho mdi or gong data .",
    "for example , the observed asphericity of the inferred sound speed may be explained by a magnetic field at the bottom of the convective zone of strength 200 - 300 kg  @xcite .",
    "we mention also that recent results on the modelling of the sunspot generation suggest that the strength of the toroidal field at the base of the solar convective zone must be on the order of 100 kg or so  @xcite in which case the bound would get stronger .    all in all , taking all of the uncertainties mentioned above into acount we find that , in the worst case , they will be able to weaken our bound at most by one order of magnitude ( see fig .  [ fig : turbulent ] ) .",
    "still the resulting bound is better than the current direct experimental bound",
    ". this situation would , in our opinion , be extremely unlikely as it would require a conspiracy .",
    "we have considered neutrino spin - flavor precession in stationary solar magnetic fields , treated perturbatively with respect to lma - msw neutrino oscillations .",
    "we have discussed the impact of the recent kamland constraint on the solar anti - neutrino flux on the solutions of the solar neutrino problem in the presence of majorana neutrino transition magnetic moments .",
    "this leads to strong limits on neutrino spin - flavor precession , involving @xmath214 .",
    "we analysed these constraints for a number of models of solar magnetic fields , both regular as well as random .",
    "we found that for a turbulent solar random magnetic field model , one can find a rather stringent constraint on the _ intrinsic _ neutrino magnetic moment down to the level of @xmath0 , similar to bounds obtained from star cooling .",
    "such magnetic moments would have no effect in the detection process , given current experimental sensitivities .",
    "we also discussed how , in the worst possible case , these limits might deteriorate at most by one order of magnitude .",
    "we note also that for the complementary case where there is no spin flavor precession in the sun and the only effect of the neutrino magnetic moment happens in the detection process  @xcite the current sensitivity is weaker than found here  @xcite .",
    "therefore we conclude that turbulent solar magnetic fields provide an enhanced sensitivity to very small neutrino transition magnetic moments .",
    "we have also shown how our result is rather insensitive to the details of the assumed model of turbulent random magnetic field .",
    "we verified this explicitly for kolmogorov s and iroshnikov - kraichnan spectra .",
    "should solar anti - neutrinos ever be detected , it is unlikely that this would be of help in testing the intrinsic scaling law @xmath215 characterizing turbulence .",

    "to justify the validity of the 2-@xmath216 scenario one can generalize it to the 3-@xmath216 case .",

    "we adopt the 2-@xmath216 picture , characterized by a single component of the transition magnetic moment matrix ( @xmath18 ) as a very good approximate description of anti - neutrino production .",
