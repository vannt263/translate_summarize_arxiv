    "low - noise heterodyne receivers working around 1  thz are highly desired instruments in submillimeter ( submm ) radio astronomy .",

    "detection of molecular or atomic thz emission lines provides access to a rich information source containing the physical and chemical conditions of hot molecular / atomic gas which plays a role in star formation in the interstellar medium .",
    "precise measurements of these conditions allow , therefore , to complete the fundamental idea how stars form and evolve.@xcite for this purpose it is necessary to have the most sensitive detectors available which are the centerpiece of every heterodyne receiver system .",
    "high sensitivity heterodyne receivers for radio - astronomy employ two different types of superconducting detectors . for the submm frequency range of 0.3 - 1.3  thz , superconductor - insulator - superconductor ( sis ) frequency mixers are used . here",
    ", one uses in practice the high - quality niobium - trilayer technology in combination with an aluminum - oxide ( @xmath1 ) or aluminum - nitride ( aln)@xcite tunnel barrier , resulting in junctions with the lowest subgap currents . in sis heterodyne mixers the highest detectable frequency",
    "is set by the superconducting gap energy @xmath2 of the junction s electrode material . for a symmetric junction",
    "this frequency is @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the superconducting pair breaking energy of one electrode and @xmath5 is the planck constant .",
    "heterodyne mixing well above the pair breaking frequency of the single electrodes is not intrinsically limited by the electrode material itself , albeit that in the frequency range @xmath6 excess quasiparticles are created , absorbing a part of the incoming signal . for the higher frequencies superconducting hot - electron bolometer mixers ( heb )",
    "are used.@xcite in an heb device there is in principle no limitation with respect to the detection frequency , however , it has a lower intermediate frequency bandwidth than a sis mixer .",
    "sis and heb devices have provided a remarkable success of ground - based,@xcite airborne@xcite and space@xcite observatories and will be of significant importance for future astronomical observations .",
    "since heterodyne detection is a coherent detection technique where amplitude and phase of the incoming signal are preserved during the frequency mixing process , the heisenberg uncertainty principle imposes a fundamental noise limit on the device sensitivity.@xcite this noise limit corresponds to the photon shot noise at the input of the mixer coming from a background of one photon per second per hertz of bandwidth .",
    "when expressed as a noise temperature , this results in @xmath7 , i.e.  0.047  k / ghz , also referred to as the quantum noise limit , where @xmath8 is the signal frequency and @xmath9 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "quantum limited mixer performance@xcite is reliably achieved up to frequencies of about 680  ghz , the superconducting gap frequency of the niobium ( nb ) embedding circuit . for larger frequencies ,",
    "substantial ohmic losses are observed in the embedding circuit due to breaking cooper pairs in the material in combination with the usually large normal state resistance of superconductors .",
    "possible solutions to minimize these losses are embedding circuits consisting of different materials than nb .",

    "we propose a different solution for this particular problem and show its effectiveness .",
    "device heating by quasiparticle trapping is removed by inserting a normal metal layer of gold ( au ) between the nb junction and the nbtin embedding circuit where nonequilibrium quasiparticles relax their energy .    in the following section we present the conceptional background of our device design and a detailed explanation of the expected quasiparticle processes in our device .",

    "in sis junctions for heterodyne mixer applications one demands a nearly ideal nonlinearity of the i , v characteristic : a low subgap current and a sharp onset of the quasiparticle current branch . for a low subgap current",
    "one needs a high - quality tunnel barrier , which in practice is best achieved with nb - trilayer technology with an @xmath1 or aln tunnel barrier .",
    "the frequency range from 700 ghz to 1.3 thz can be covered by such a nonlinear i , v curve provided one can avoid or minimize absorption of the signal by the embedding circuit .",
    "if this is the case one ought to be able to obtain high - performance devices reaching quantum limited noise temperatures.@xcite the preferred solution is the use of a superconductor with a higher critical temperature and a higher energy gap than nb .",

    "( [ eq:01 ] ) represents the tunneling current assuming that only lowest order tunnel processes are relevant .",
    "as long as the tunnel probability is much less than unity , the higher order processes are indeed negligible . however , for very thin tunnel barriers , needed for broadband heterodyne mixers , the likelihood of weak spots increases causing a fraction of the tunnel barrier to have a higher tunneling probability , even close to unity , allowing significant contributions from higher order tunneling processes .",
    "these are easily identified as excess shot noise,@xcite and are also visible as excess subgap currents , neglected by eq .",
    "( [ eq:01 ] ) .    in principle , in using tunnel junctions it is assumed that the tunnel barrier is a weak disturbance i.e.  that the two electrodes are undisturbed by the tunneling current .",

    "we are interested in sis devices in which this particular assumption is no longer satisfied .",
    "we will focus on the option that due to the dissipated power , the temperature @xmath27 of the electron system is higher than the bath temperature .",
    "this new temperature @xmath27 will enter the fermi - functions in eq .",
    "( [ eq:01 ] ) .",

    "the temperature @xmath27 is dependent on the power generated by the tunneling process , which rapidly rises for bias voltages near the gap voltage @xmath33 , implying that the relevant energy gap for the tunneling decreases leading to the possibility of back - bending ( a negative slope of @xmath10 around @xmath33 , compare with figure  [ fig:04](a ) ) .",
    "the actual temperature @xmath34 in comparison to the bath temperature , the phonon - temperature @xmath35 , depends on two processes .",
    "first , a thin tunnel barrier leads to a higher density of hot electrons injected per unit time .",
    "we assume that the electron - electron interaction time @xmath36 is short enough to establish that an effective energy relaxation will occur by electron - phonon interaction , assuming @xmath37 , if one has a closed volume .",
    "otherwise , the outdiffusion of hot electrons compensated by the indiffusion of cool electrons establishes equilibrium . for conventional aluminum oxide barriers the barrier integrity breaks down before nonequilibrium processes become relevant .",
    "however , for lower @xmath25-products , such as is possible by using aln barriers , an elevated electron temperature does play a role .",

    "here , a quasiparticle injected from the tunnel barrier into the au layer thermalizes with other quasiparticles after a time @xmath36 and becomes an excited quasiparticle with energy @xmath39 which is relaxed by inelastic electron - phonon scattering after the time @xmath40 .",

    "this leads to a geometrical trapping of the quasiparticles,@xcite illustrated in fig .",

    "therefore , we seek a solution to avoid these nonequilibrium processes in an attempt to maintain the electron temperature @xmath27 as close as possible to the phonon temperature @xmath35 . our solution is to insert between the nb film and the nbtin film a normal metal au layer , which allows quick thermalization of the hot electrons in the nb as shown in fig .",

    "therefore , these metals share one common phonon system .",
    "furthermore , the thermal healing length is determined only by the phonon - escape rate at the au - lhe interface when the devices are directly immersed in lhe or by the phonon - escape rate at the au-@xmath65 interface when we consider devices which are cooled in a vacuum environment . with these assumptions",

    "for the calculations we use the kapitza conductance at the au - lhe interface since these devices were directly immersed in lhe during our measurements .",
    "we start first with the discussion of the obtained results in fig .",
    "[ fig:06](a ) .",
    "the experimental results were obtained by evaluation of eq .",
    "( [ eq:03 ] ) with the i , v values of device # 6 as input parameters .",
    "the dashed theoretical line shows the prediction of the electron temperature rise with increasing dissipated power in the au cap volume directly on top of the sis junction ( region within the dotted lines in fig .",

    "[ fig:04](b ) ) due to the energy broadening of the quasiparticle density of states .",
    "hence , we obtain an electron temperature smaller than the bath temperature .",
    "the slope of this @xmath45-@xmath27 curve is solely used to extract the energy broadening correction of the quasiparticle density of states to the effective electron temperature @xmath27 and does not represent the real device temperature of device # 6 . in device # 6 , due to the largest area among all devices in this paper ,",
    "the lowest magnetic field is necessary in order to suppress the _ dc _ josephson effect .",
    "we expect , therefore , that in this device the local density of states of the superconducting electrodes are least modified by the magnetic field .",
    "the fit to the data in this device is shown by the dashed - and - dotted line ( labeled with \" fit  ) . as a result of the fit we find that the slope of the theoretical prediction ( dashed line ) can be mapped onto the experimental slope by adding a term @xmath140 .    when adding the correction term @xmath140 to the theoretical prediction of the @xmath45-@xmath27 trend of device # 5 , the curve labeled with `` th+corr '' in fig .",
    "[ fig:06](b ) is obtained .",
    "we find that we can describe the data sufficiently well following this approach .",
    "the small discrepancy between the curve labeled with `` th+corr '' and the experimental curve labeled with `` exp '' can be best explained by a small modification of the local density of states of the superconducting nb electrodes by the magnetic field .",
    "because of the significant smaller cross section of device # 5 compared to device # 6 ( compare with the junction radius @xmath67 in table  [ tab:03 ] ) , a larger magnetic field has to be applied to device # 5 to induce the same magnetic flux as in device # 6 .",
    "therefore , by adding an additional conservative correction term with value @xmath141 to the `` th+corr '' curve ( not shown in the figure ) , accounting for the influence of the magnetic field on the local density of states , we can describe the experimentally obtained slope sufficiently well over the full range of the dissipated power @xmath45 .    for device # 7",
    ", we did not perform a similar analysis like described before . during the measurements with this device we applied the strongest magnetic field among all other measurements , necessary due to the small junction area of this device ( cf",
    ".  table  [ tab:03 ] ) .",
    "hence the experimental @xmath45-@xmath27 slope which one would obtain from the corresponding i , v curve should not be considered to be a representative measurement .",
    "however , we show the i , v characteristic of this device in fig .  [",
    "fig:04](b ) for comparison to the i , v characteristic of device # 6 .",
    "we observe that the slope at the onset of the quasiparticle branch of the i , v characteristic of device # 6 is almost vertical whereas for device # 7 we measure an i , v characteristic with a positive slope .",
    "although the experimental result for device # 6 ( and in principle also for device # 7 ) suggests that the effective electron temperature has reached the phonon temperature , we have to stress that the effective electron temperature in the device will follow the theoretical prediction ( dashed curve ) in fig .",
    "[ fig:06](a ) as this trend does not contain the energy broadened quasiparticle density of states which effectively decreases the experimental result for @xmath27 .",
    "this means that the effective electron temperature in device # 6 is still slightly above the phonon temperature . comparing the results for device # 6 and # 5 in figs .",
    "[ fig:06](a ) and ( b ) we find that at the same dissipated power of say @xmath142 , the effective electron temperature in device # 6 is about 0.1  k lower than in device # 5 .",
    "this once more shows the _ geometrically assisted cooling effect _ of the au layer on the electron temperature @xmath27 in the nb electrodes .",
    "when calculating @xmath27 in device # 5 with an au cap having thickness @xmath143  nm and @xmath144 , therefore , choosing the same geometry as for the au cap in devices # 6 and # 7 , we find that at @xmath145w dissipated power , @xmath146  k ( including the correction for the quasiparticle density of states energy broadening ) .",
    "thus , this electron temperature is approximately 60  mk lower than the measured value for the actual device geometry . at some value of @xmath66 , a further increase of the au cap radius",
    "has no influence anymore on decreasing @xmath27 and @xmath41 has to be thicker .",
    "evidently , dependent on how much power is dissipated in the device , there are many design possibilities in order to achieve an electron temperature in the device equal / close to the phonon temperature .",
    "since the thermal healing length @xmath128 is independent of the dissipated power in the device and of the au cap radius @xmath66 , it can only be used for a rough estimate of the au cap size . however , as a necessary condition for the _ geometrically assisted cooling _",
    "we find that obviously @xmath147 . nevertheless , even when this condition is fulfilled , in principle one has to solve eq .",
    "( [ eq:05 ] ) with the specific device geometry as input parameter in order to determine the electron temperature in the device .",
    "before we present our conclusions we would like to make a few remarks which have to be considered when implementing our device concept in a practical mixer design for a heterodyne receiver experiment . here , it is important to estimate possible signal losses caused by the normal metal au layer in the superconducting circuit .    first , from _ dc_-characterization measurements of the sns devices # 8 and # 9 , not further discussed in detail in this paper , we determine a critical current of @xmath148a at @xmath149  k for device # 8 and a critical current of @xmath150  ma at @xmath151  k for the larger area device # 9 , cf .",
    "also table  [ tab:01 ] .",
    "the normal state resistances of devices # 8 and # 9 are @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "a tunnel current through the ssisns device larger than the critical current of the sns part causes that a series resistance appears which is equal to the normal state resistance of the sns part .",
    "however , the typical contact areas of the sns layer structure on top of the tunnel barrier are much larger than the areas of the test devices # 8 and # 9 which we fabricated extra - small in order to obtain a significant voltage - drop across the device , simplifying the measurements . therefore , in our ssisns devices",
    ", it is to be expected that the critical current of the sns part exceeds the tunnel current through the insulating barrier by far and , thus , for a _ dc _ current the normal metal au layer does not represent a series resistance to the overall ssisns normal state resistance .",
    "second , in case of an _ rf _ current induced by a microwave signal in a heterodyne experiment , the au layer causes _ rf _ signal loss .",
    "however , compared to the size of other circuit parts of typical sis mixer layouts , the micron - sized au layer is comparatively small and should , therefore , not entail a significant amount of signal loss in the mixer .",
    "nevertheless , in the design of high - q tuning circuits for thz frequencies , crucial for low - noise mixer operation and for efficient coupling the signal radiation to the mixing element over a broad frequency bandwidth , the proximity - effect modified local density of states in the normal metal au layer due to the two superconductors nb and nbtin , changing the complex conductivity of the normal metal material , has to be considered by a generalized _ mattis and bardeen _",
    "to conclude , in this paper we have reported several device geometries combining the high - quality nb - trilayer technology with a full superconducting nbtin embedding circuit and conducted _ dc_-characterization measurements of the devices .",
    "we measured the effective electron temperature @xmath27 as a function of the applied bias current in terms of the electron - temperature dependent superconducting gap energy @xmath77 .",
    "we find that a normal metal layer , in our experiments we used au , sandwiched between the nb junction and between one of the nbtin leads , decreases the electron temperature compared to the control device in which no normal metal layer is used .",
    "for a normal metal layer which is laterally confined to the same area like the nb electrode ( case i ) , we measure an increase in the cooling of the nonequilibrium quasiparticle system with increasing thickness @xmath41 of the normal metal layer .",
    "we identify two different heat - flow bottlenecks in these devices , namely between the electrons and the phonons in the nb material , whereas in the au the phonon escape process from the material to the bath is the slowest energy relaxation mechanism .",
    "the resulting theoretical heat - transfer coefficient @xmath113 describes the experimentally determined value @xmath118 sufficiently well .",
    "case ii covers devices which have normal metal au layers substantially wider than the nb electrodes . here we observe enhanced cooling of the nonequilibrium quasiparticles compared to case i which we relate to _ geometrically assisted cooling _",
    ", i.e.  nonequilibrium quasiparticles relax their energy in the wide au layer by outdiffusion , electron - phonon scattering and phonon escape to the thermal bath .",
    "the heat - flow can be explained by a simple thermal model which takes the au layer geometry and the aforementioned energy relaxation processes into account , provided that one considers also the energy broadening of the quasiparticle density of states .",
    "we have highlighted the prospects of using our device technology in a future heterodyne experiment where one can expect a substantial improvement in the mixer sensitivity due to the low _",
