    "the concept of moving groups was first introduced by olin eggen in the 1960s . basically the stars form from a common progenitor gas cloud .",
    "as the cluster disperses around the galaxy , it stretches into a tube - like structure around the galactic plane and after several galactic orbits it will dissolve into the galactic background .",
    "if the sun happens to be inside this tube , the member stars will appear all over the sky but may be identified as a group through their common space velocities .",
    "a moving group is therefore the in - between step from bound clusters to field stars .",
    "+ for this reason moving groups are an important class of objects for the purpose of testing the chemical tagging technique put forward by @xcite . in summary ,",
    "the long term goal of chemical tagging is to reassemble the ancient star - forming aggregates in the galactic disk by studying their chemical signatures , in order to unravel the sequence of events involved in the dissipative formation of the disk .",
    "one of the fundamental requirements for the viability of chemical tagging is chemical homogeneity within individual disk clusters .",
    "since most bound open clusters are believed to be chemically homogeneous ( eg . hyades @xcite and collinder 261 @xcite ) , establishing homogeneity in unbound moving groups which retain some kinematical identity is the next step for the chemical tagging technique .",
    "the final step is to chemically identify groups which have no dynamical identity .",
    "+ although the existence of many stellar moving groups has been suggested , the reality of most is yet to be verified . in the past due to the lack of accurate parallaxes",
    "it has been difficult to reliably identify the stellar members of moving groups .",
    "this has now been partly overcome from the observations by the hipparcos satellite .",
    "the presence of a moving group associated with the star hr1614 , first advocated by @xcite , was verified by @xcite using the new hipparcos parallaxes and recent radial velocities , and provides an extended sample of stellar members .",
    "+ eggen s initial identification of the moving group came from studying a sample of stars within @xmath1 10  of the galactic rotational velocity ( v ) of star hr1614 .",
    "he used the high excess in @xmath2 as a membership criterion for his stars to obtain a color - magnitude diagram ( * ? ? ?",

    "resembling that of an old open cluster .",
    "based on a few spectroscopic studies and positions in the m@xmath3 vs.  @xmath4 color - magnitude diagram , @xcite concluded that the majority of stars he classified as members were as metal rich as the hyades .",
    "+ followup studies by @xcite using ddo photometry showed enhanced cyanogen bands in @xcite sample stars .",
    "the derived metallicity confirmed eggen s estimate of a high metallicity , but two giants found to have significantly low metallicity cast doubt over eggen s @xmath2 membership criteria . enforcing a strict criterion using ubv , ddo and @xmath2 , @xcite showed that many of eggen s original candidates did not belong to the group .",
    "@xcite , utilizing the cn - enhancement , provided a second sample of main sequence dwarfs with the same v - velocity restrictions as applied earlier . with the accurate parallax measurements made available from the hipparcos mission , @xcite showed that the group membership for his hr1614 sample @xcite is supported by hipparcos parallaxes .",
    "however for two stars where the discrepancies were large , @xcite suggested errors in the hipparcos parallaxes .",

    "following simulations by @xcite and their own basic simulations , fh find the observed tilt in the uv plane to be a feature of a moving group .",
    "in contrast , the classical criteria used by eggen ( based on epicyclic theory ) , requires all member stars to lie at constant v in the uv plane .",
    "fh state that such central clumping will only occur if the sun is located very close to the center of the moving group , otherwise a tilt is to be expected . + with the past literature pointing towards its reality , the hr1614 moving group is an attractive target for testing chemical tagging .",
    "the star cluster is quite distinctive due to its age of about 2 gyr , and high metallicity of [ fe / h]= + 0.25 .",

    "these temperature estimates were used as an initial guess when deriving spectroscopic temperatures .",

    "also , note that four stars ( hip 13513 , hip6762 , hip 25840 , hip 116970 ) were found to have solar - level abundances for all elements except for the heavier n - capture elements .",
    "these stars are identified in the plots with different symbols .",
    "we will discuss our results and these deviating stars in detail in section [ sect : discuss ] .",
    "the derived absolute abundances ( log @xmath13 ) of the sample stars are presented in table [ tab : abundance ] .",
    "the main sources of error in the present study are that of ew measurements , continuum placement and stellar parameters . because we are only interested in the differential abundances , external errors , such as uncertainties in the line data and model atmospheres are the least sources of error .",
    "the number of lines used to calculate the final abundances also contributed to the total uncertainty for each element .",
    "+ the error in ews was estimated by repeated measurements of each line .",
    "the measurement errors for the synthesized abundances were derived by changing the abundance until there is a clear visible deviation from the best fit .",

    "while open cluster members are easily determined from radial velocities with errors less than a few kilometers per second , moving group membership is based on uvw space motion , but the exact criteria for selecting members remain somewhat uncertain .",
    "+ eggen s method of isolating moving group members required all member stars to have the same v - velocity , ie . in the direction of the galactic rotation . in the epicycle approximation ,",
    "as a star orbits around the galaxy , it travels on an epicycle about the circular guiding center of its galactic orbit .",
    "if member stars , which would have originated from the one location , are now in the solar neighborhood , within the observable horizon , then this limits their guiding center radii to be very close to that of the sun .",
    "those member stars with longer and shorter guiding center radii would be either ahead or lag behind the sun and therefore not be within a small locally defined volume .",
    "this means that hr 1614 group member stars located within a small volume should have a similar v - velocity .",
    "any scatter in v would reflect the scatter in the orbital radii .",
    "this variation can not be large for stars within a small volume .",
    "+ work by fh and @xcite show that such a clump in the uv space is not necessary for all members of the moving group .",
    "their modeling shows that a small @xmath21 in the uv space is the dynamical signature of the moving group .",
    "this seems to be in contradiction with the above mentioned concept , and is primarily due to the limitations of the epicyclic approximation , but it does mean that the true kinematical signature of moving groups remain uncertain .",
    "the sample selected for our chemical analysis includes stars selected from eggen ( via the v - clump criteria ) as well as from the fh sample ( selected via the tilted criteria ) . as establishing accurate membership",
    "is a key component of our study , obtaining reliable velocity information is essential .",
    "while some velocity information is available from the literature , we have decided to undertake our own measurements in order to obtain a consistent set of velocities .",
    "+      radial velocities ( rvs ) were determined by fourier transform cross correlation of template spectra with observed spectra , making use of the packages rvsao / xcsao @xcite that are run under iraf . from the available spectra , rvs were estimated using the blue region from 4200 - 4400   and the red region from 8465 - 8680   , although the red region containing the calcium triplet was given a higher weighting .",
    "template spectra from @xcite were obtained via private communication from m. williams .",
    "since the stellar parameters were already established from our earlier spectroscopic studies , templates matching closest to the sample parameters were selected for the cross correlation . + the procedure undertaken to determine rv was as follows .",
    "the barycentric velocity correction was applied to all observed stars using the iraf package bcvcorr .",
    "the data files were then re - sampled according to the template sampling , which had a resolution of 20,000 .",
    "the continuum normalization of the data were rechecked to ensure almost complete flatness .",
    "the template files were cropped to the wavelength ranges of the observed data .",
    "since the observed echelle spectra has inter - order gaps in the red region , the red templates were split into two separate regions according to the available observed spectral windows .",
    "the two regions were from 8465 - 8550   and 8593 - 8680  which included all three of the ca  ii triplet lines .",
    "for all cross correlations , the apodizing option in xcsao was turned on to smooth the edges ( up to 5% of the spectra ) to zero by multiplication with a cosine bell function .",
    "bandpass filtering was set with the parameters low - bin and top - low for low frequency cut - offs , and parameters top - run and nrun to filter the high frequencies .",
    "the data was rebinned to 2048 bins set by ncol . by experimentation",
    ", the low frequency cut - offs were set to [ 4,20 ] which allows the broader spectral features through , while filtering out any residual low frequency structure in the continuum .",
    "for the high frequencies , we set the cut - offs to [ 240,580 ] after several experimentations to avoid suppressing any line features and ensuring all high signal data passes through , while the high noise regions are removed . + resulting radial velocity values were selected based on the goodness - of - fit parameter ( r ) as output from xcsao .",
    "the highest r value for all program stars were over 20 in the blue spectral region and over 30 in the red . while both red and blue regions gave very similar results ,",
    "the final radial velocities are an average of both the red and blue regions , with a weighting of 3:2 in favor of the red region based on the r values .",
    "the exception to this is the star hip13513 , which we measure to have a variable rv with an rv of 3.5  in the red and -46.9  in the blue , which was taken at a later date .",

    "with the exception of hip13513 , our results agree better with the measurements by ( * ? ? ? *",
    "n04 ) where the average difference is about 0.4  , than for fh where the average difference is about 4  , although they agree within the given error bars of the fh sources .",
    "our rvs for all sample stars and rv standards , as well as several literature values , are listed in table [ tab : rv ] .",
    "our errors as calculated by xcsao are less than 1 .",
    "+      using the above computed rvs , and proper motions and parallaxes from hipparcos , we calculated uvw space velocities making use of the conversion code obtained via private communication from m.  williams .",
    "the resulting velocities are with respect to the lsr adopting the standard solar motion of u = 10 , v = 5 , and w = 7  @xcite .",
    "table [ tab : uvw ] lists our derived velocities , as well as those from fh .",
    "overall our velocities are in good agreement with fh with mean differences of about 1.7 , 0.6 , and 2.1  in u , v and w respectively .",
    "+ figure [ fig : uv ] shows the position of our stars in the uv plane using the new velocities obtained in this study . the presence of a slight slope seems to support the tilted membership criterion argued by fh . by fitting a",
    "least squares regression line of the form , v = a + bu , we find a = -55.06 and b = 0.18 .",
    "the significance of this slope depends on the measurement errors .",
    "taking into account errors in rv s and hipparcos parallaxes , our typical errors are @xmath22 2  for u , @xmath22 10  for v and @xmath22 5  for w. considering the uncertainty in the v - velocity to be on average 6  and disregarding the small uncertainty in u - velocity , we derive the uncertainty in the gradient ( b ) of the best fitting line to be @xmath1 0.05 .",
    "therefore the slight tilt in figure [ fig : uv ] is marginally significant and lends support to fh s tilted membership criterion in the uv plane .",
    "we will discuss the issue of membership in detail in section [ sect : membership ] .",
    "we have studied a total of 18 stars that were thought to be members following the kinematical criteria of fh and @xcite . out of this sample ,",
    "four stars are found to deviate from the cluster mean in all elements except the n - capture elements . disregarding these four stars for the moment",
    ", our abundance analysis demonstrates that the moving group is chemically enriched with mean [ fe / h ] = 0.25 adopting a solar value of 7.52 @xcite , comparable to the result obtained by fh using photometric techniques given the estimated errors .",

    "+ disregarding the four deviating stars , table [ intscatter ] summarizes the intrinsic star - to - star scatter @xmath23 within the hr1614 moving group . by examining the uncertainties in our abundance error analysis",
    "we also calculate the uncertainty of the estimated intrinsic scatter . assuming our abundance measurements follow a gaussian distribution we estimate the confidence interval for the uncertainty in intrinsic scatter . taking into account the sampling error in the observed scatter and a 10% uncertainty in our adopted measurement errors , we find that the stated uncertainty limits in table [ intscatter ] are approximately 80% confidence limits for @xmath23 .",
    "further , based on a @xmath24 analysis we derive the probability of finding the observed scatter given the measurement errors and zero intrinsic scatter .",
    "figure [ probhr1614 ] plots this probability for the different elements .",
    "+ the above analysis does not include the four deviating stars .",
    "since our aim is to obtain an estimate of the level of chemical homogeneity in all the moving group members , it is important for us to determine the nature of the deviating stars . if they are found to be non - members or peculiar in some way ( including binary systems , where the original birth abundance level may have been modified ) , then the level of homogeneity observed is indeed very high . if there is a reason to include the deviating stars , the mean level of homogeneity will rise to well over 0.1 dex .",
    "however given the clear bimodality of the results , it seems likely that these stars have a different origin .",

    "figure [ fig : cmd ] shows the cmd of our sample stars with the deviating stars marked with their respective symbols . hip25840 and hip6762 lie clearly away from the main sequence , providing further reason to discard these stars as possible non - members or binaries .",

    "+ our investigation fails to identify star hip116970 as a non - member or peculiar in any way .",
    "it satisfies both fh and eggen s velocity criteria , lies in the middle of the main sequence in the cmd , and has no variability or binary observed in other surveys .",
    "a plausible scenario is that this star is a field star unassociated with the hr1614 moving group , but lies within the group s kinematical and photometric interval simply by chance . out of our total sample of 18 stars we discover only the one star (",

    "no prior restrictions were made on the metallicity .",
    "this suggests that one in seven stars from the background galactic disk in this restricted interval of absolute magnitude , color and velocity will have solar - level metallicity [ fe / h ] = 0.00 @xmath1 0.05 . we can therefore expect about one in seven such background stars in our hr 1614 moving group sample .",
    "the clear bimodal abundance pattern seen for the @xmath26 , fe , fe - peak and light s - process elements is interesting .",
    "as discussed above , of the four deviating stars , only one can not be classed as a non - member , a binary or otherwise peculiar star based on its kinematics or photometric properties .",
    "although we are not aware of any prior calculation of the expected rate of contamination from field stars that are not part of the group , our simple estimate based on besancon stellar population models show that some contamination ( 15% ) is to be expected .",
    "it is likely that there are other such contaminating stars in this ( and other ) moving groups , that are not yet identified due to the lack of detailed chemical information .",
    "our results are a clear demonstration of the necessity and importance of obtaining detailed chemical information , and that chemical probing is essential to see the true story behind the history of any stellar stream in the galactic disk . + our results support the conclusion of @xcite regarding the reality of the hr 1614 moving group .",
    "several authors have argued that at least some moving stellar groups are not the dispersed remnants of star - forming events , but rather are dynamical in origin , resulting from the dynamical effects of the galactic bar or spiral structure ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". we would not expect such dynamical groups to be coeval and chemically homogeneous .",
    "the homogeneity of the hr1614 group in age and abundance supports the view that this group is indeed the remnant of a dispersed star - forming event .",
    "its kinematical coherence shows that such a dispersing system need not be significantly perturbed by external dynamical influences like galactic spiral structure or giant molecular clouds , at least over a period of order 2 gyr .",
    "+ finally , the high level of chemical homogeneity observed across the confirmed hr1614 moving group members is a major step forward for chemical tagging .",
    "earlier @xcite reported chemical homogeneity in the hyades which is a younger bound star cluster .",
    "our study on the very old open cluster cr 261 ( de silva et al .",
    ", in preparation ) also show similar levels of homogeneity and in it we further explore the implications of our combined results on chemical tagging .",
    "here we have shown that an unbound intermediate - aged cluster is also chemically identifiable .",

    "<S> + disregarding these four stars , the abundance scatter across the group members for all elements is low . we find that there is an 80% probability that the intrinsic scatter does not exceed the following values : fe 0.01 ; na 0.08 ; mg 0.02 ; al 0.06 ; si 0.02 ; ca 0.02 ; mn 0.01 ; ni 0.01 ; zr 0.03 ; ba 0.03 ; ce 0.04 ; nd 0.01 and eu 0.02 dex . </S>",

    "<S> its kinematical coherence shows that such a dispersing system need not be significantly perturbed by external dynamical influences like galactic spiral structure or giant molecular clouds , at least over a period of 2 gyr . </S>"
