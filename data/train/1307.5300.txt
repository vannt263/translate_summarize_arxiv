    "international travels and cross - border exposure were not affected although the who raised the global pandemic alert level to the phase 5 on april 29 , which signals that community transmission is sustained across national borders .",
    "this is confirmed by the estimate by the united nations world tourism organization that the tourism declined by only 4 % in mexico .",
    "the public awareness of the pandemic might not be as acute as that at the time of the sars outbreak probably because the flu in 2009 was mild in contrast to the severe flu in 1918 , 1957 , and 1968 .",
    "but the change in @xmath14 is detected .",
    "selecting this model is decisive .",
    "the estimated value decreases by 52% at the estimated change point @xmath123}=7.5 $ ] which is may 5 .",
    "the consequent reproductive ratio decreases from @xmath144 to @xmath145 .",
    "@xmath146 is nearly the same as the basic reproductive ratio obtained from epidemiological and genetic analyses in mexico@xcite and the united states@xcite .",
    "local public health authorities in many countries started mandatory school closures , requested cancellation of large mass gatherings , and took other possible social distancing measures in may@xcite .",
    "the implemented intervention was effective in controlling local exposure .",
    "* although the findings for the sars outbreak and flu pandemic are still merely narrative evidence , the change points are indicative of the potential impact of public health intervention on cross - border epidemic transmission .",
    "the cross - border epidemic transmission ensues from a generally complex interplay between movements and infection .",
    "these stochastic processes may have adverse effects .",
    "cross - border movements prompt the geographical distribution of cases to reach equilibrium while infection fuels local ourbreak . in this study ,",
    "the complexity is resolved by decomposing the langevin equations in eq.([apdi / dt ] ) into smaller dimensional model selection sub - problems so that they can be solved individually and sequentially with the state - of - the - art model selectors in bayesian statistics .",
    "*    public health authorities need to understand the efficacy of raising public awareness , social distancing , and other measures when they design an effective public health program and make an urgent decision on the verge of massive community transmission . raising public awareness includes cancellation or postponement of travels , pre - travel health advisories , giving advices via mass media on hand washing , personal hygiene , cough etiquette , the use of face masks , hand rubs , and vaccine . in addition , border health screening , arrival and departure monitoring , dedicated ambulances , isolated hospital wards , and disinfection on public transport can be implemented .",
    "it is anticipated in the current practices that quarantine on board and temperature screening at airports will stop infectious travelers from entering across national or regional borders .",
    "such a naive anticipation gives rise to much controversy about the economic efficiency .",
    "the anticipation is tested with observations when the intervention is implemented actually . the efficacy is quantified by the change in the probability parameters , and the economic efficiency is calculated .",
    "the public health authorities can accumulate ground information from such testing to organize an internationally shared extensive knowledge base on miscellaneous individual or combined public health intervention , its rational and anticipated outcome , empirical evidence on its efficacy , and possible reasons for the gap between the anticipation and observations , along with the supplementary knowledge from field - based medical case studies , epidemiological , and genetic studies under many demographic circumstances .    in obtaining more minute ground information for the knowledge base , the method in this study",
    "will be extended to more complicated mathematical models so that multiple change points can be detected , localized change points can be analyzed , and multiple geographic resolutions can be incorporated .",
    "the combined public health intervention may take effects mutiple times on different datas .",
    "the trend change in the entire population may arise from large localized trend changes in only a few sub - populations ( an anomaly which violates the empirical law in eq.([gammacalc ] ) ) .",
    "adjusting resolutions may be essential in the drilling - down from country level course analysis to province , city , and district level fine analyses .",
    "these are the topics for future studies .",
