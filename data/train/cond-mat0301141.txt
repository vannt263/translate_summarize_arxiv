    "usually in these approaches , the ratio of the characteristic coulomb energy ( at distances of the order of the magnetic length ) to the cyclotron energy , has been assumed to be small .",
    "however , in a weak magnetic field this is not the case , and the characteristic coulomb energy exceeds the cyclotron energy .",
    "an attempt to investigate the situation with large coulomb energy was made in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the progress in understanding of the clean 2deg in a weak magnetic field was achieved by aleiner and glazman  @xcite .",
    "they have derived the low - energy effective theory on the partially filled highest landau level by using the small parameter @xmath5 . by treating the effective interaction within the hartree - fock approximation , koulakov ,",
    "fogler , and shklovskii  @xcite predicted a unidirectional charge - density - wave ( cdw ) state ( stripe phase ) for the half - filled highest landau level at zero temperature and in the absence of disorder .",
    "moessner and chalker  @xcite extended the ideas of fukuyama , platzmann and anderson  @xcite to the case of a partially filled highest landau level and showed the existence of the mean - field cdw state on the half - filled landau level below some temperature @xmath6 .",
    "recently , the existence of compressible states near half - filling with anisotropic transport properties was demonstrated experimentally for high landau levels  @xcite .",
    "this stimulates an extensive study of the clean 2deg in a weak magnetic field and pinning of stripes by disorder  @xcite .    in the clean case",
    ", the properties of the cdw states can be described on the basis of the low energy effective theory for smooth `` elastic '' deformations  @xcite .",
    "recently , attempts were made to derive such a theory microscopically starting from the mean - field solution  @xcite .",
    "the effects of a quenched disorder on the unidirectional cdw state ( stripe phase ) were investigated in the framework of the phenomenological elasticity theory  @xcite , and a rich variety of different regimes , which depend on the strength of disorder , were found . however , to identify the phenomenological parameters of the theory , a successive microscopic theory should be developed .    at present , a thorough microscopic analysis of the effects of disorder on the mean - field transition from the uniform state to the cdw one , as well as on the phase diagram of the mean - field cdw states , is absent .",
    "the main objective of the present paper is to investigate these effects on the existence of the mean - field cdw states in 2deg in a weak perpendicular magnetic field @xmath7 ( filling factor @xmath0 ) . for the considered case of a large number of the occupied landau levels ,",
    "the mean - field analysis is legitimate because the fluctuations of the order parameter are strongly suppressed  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the mean - field approach can not be applied to the critical region in the direct vicinity of the phase transition .",
    "this region is however small and does not lead to any significant uncertainty in our results for critical temperatures of the transitions .",
    "we assume the presence in the system of a weak quenched disorder , i.e. the elastic collisions time satisfies the condition @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the cyclotron frequency , @xmath10 the electron charge , and @xmath11 the effective electron mass . under this condition ,",
    "the landau level broadening @xmath12 , which is of the order of @xmath13 , is much less than the spacing @xmath14 between them .",
    "this case can be realized in high mobility samples which were used for experimental studies of the anisotropic magnetotransport @xcite .",
    "keeping in mind that the relation @xmath15 is usually hold , one expect a much pronounced influence of the quenched disorder on the properties of electrons on the partially filled highest landau level even for a small level broadening @xmath16 .",
    "one of the main results of our paper is that at zero temperature the mean - field cdw state is destroyed when the landau level broadening exceeds the critical value @xmath17 . at nonzero temperatures the quenched disorder leads to the decrease of the temperature of the cdw instability as compared to the clean case .",
    "the physical reason is that the scattering on impurities breaks the cdw correlations , and therefore results in the destruction of the coherent cdw state .",
    "this is somewhat similar to the suppression of the critical temperature in conventional superconductors by magnetic impurities  @xcite or in anisotropic superconductors by nonmagnetic impurities  @xcite .",

    "the landau expansions ( [ fetri ] ) and ( [ feuni ] ) for the free energy of the cdw states were derived under the assumption that one can neglect the fluctuations of the cdw order parameter .",

    "now we discuss the possible applications of our theory to the recent experiments .",
    "although our mean - field theory was derived for the case of a large number of the occupied landau level @xmath64 , and neglects corrections of the order of @xmath268 , while experimentally one has @xmath269 , we however expect that eq.([spin ] ) gives a good estimation for the temperature of the transition from the uniform to the cdw state , even for @xmath269 .",
    "we have complementary assurance that it can really be the case because eq.([spin ] ) can be obtained without introducing the cdw order parameter and considering the mean - field theory but as the equation that determines the temperature @xmath183 at which the two - particle vertex function at wave vector @xmath77 diverges  @xcite .",
    "we restrict ourselves by discussion of the experiments without an in - plane magnetic field  @xcite .",

    "the estimate of the temperature of instability @xmath6 in the absence of disorder is more subtle .",
    "the theory can provide an estimate for @xmath270 and , correspondingly , for the value of @xmath6 only for a weak magnetic field . in this case the value of @xmath270 can be found analytically  @xcite with the following result for @xmath6 @xmath271 where the numerical parameter @xmath272 only slightly depends on @xmath273 in the range @xmath274 , and approximately @xmath275 .",
    "the broadening of the landau level @xmath276 can be estimated from the mobility at zero magnetic field .",
    "however , the results obtained in sec .  [ mfpd.hfll ] impose the restriction on the value of the sample mobility at zero magnetic field . in order to observe the cdw states at the partially filled landau level with index @xmath32",
    "the mobility at zero magnetic field should satisfy the condition @xmath277 where @xmath278 denotes the electron density of 2deg . for typical values of the electron density of 2deg",
    "we can obtain the following estimate @xmath279 .    in the experiments of lilly",
    "@xcite , the samples were relatively clean ( mobilities exceed @xmath280 ) , and the anisotropy was observed for @xmath281 below @xmath282 .",
    "for the temperature @xmath283 , the anisotropy in the resistance was found to disappear with the decreasing the magnetic field for @xmath284 .",
    "we plot experimental points in fig .",
    "[ fig.mfpd.hfll ] under the assumption that eq.([alpha ] ) remains valid even for @xmath285 and @xmath286 .",
    "as it can be seen from this figure , for a constant magnetic field the highest temperature at which anisotropy appears , corresponds to @xmath281 .",
    "as the magnetic field decreases at some constant temperature , the anisotropy disappears at some value of @xmath32 due to the disorder induced transition from the cdw state to the uniform .",
    "it should be mentioned that without the effects of disorder the anisotropy in the resistance should remains up to @xmath287 at @xmath288 .",
    "therefore , the disorder plays an important role even in the high mobility samples .",

    "the system of 12 electrons interacting via the coulomb interaction @xmath289 in the presence of the quenched disorder was projected on the second landau level ( @xmath281 ) .",
    "the effects of interactions with electrons on the other landau level was not taken into account .",
    "the system was diagonalized numerically .",
    "it was found that the cdw state transforms into a uniform liquid state as the dimensionless disorder strength @xmath290 exceeds @xmath291 .    in order to be able to compare the results of the presented above mean - field theory with the numerical results , we perform the evaluation of the temperature @xmath6 in the case for which the numerical results were obtained ( instead screened interaction ( [ u0 ] ) we use @xmath289 ) . under this",
    "curcumstances our theory gives the value @xmath292 .",
    "the small discrepancy may be attributed to two factors : on the one hand , the finite number of electrons in numerical calculations and , on the one hand , unsufficience of the hartree - fock approximation for the problem with the coulomb interaction @xmath293 . in the later case",
    "one should take into account the diagrams beyond the hartree - fock theory .",
    "nevertheless , the comparison demonstrates that such corrections are small .",
    "we emphasize that our theory which takes into account the screening of electron - electron interaction by electrons on the other landau levels gives much smaller value 0.038 of the dimensionless disorder strength for the transition from the uniform liquid state to the cdw state .",
