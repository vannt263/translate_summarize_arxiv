    "physical networked infrastructures ( @xmath0s ) such as power , gas or water distribution are at the heart of the functioning of our society ; they are very well engineered systems designed to be at least @xmath1 robust  i.e. , they should be resilient to the loss of a single component via automatic or human guided interventions .",
    "the constantly growing size of @xmath0s has increased the possibility of multiple failures which escape the @xmath1 criteria ; however , implementing robustness to _ any sequence _ of @xmath2 failures ( @xmath3 robustness ) requires an exponentially growing effort in means and investments .",
    "in general , since @xmath0s can be considered to be aggregations of a large number of simple units , they are expected to exhibit emergent behaviour , i.e. they show as a whole additional complexity beyond what is dictated by the simple sum of its parts @xcite .",
    "a general problem of @xmath0s are cascading failures , i.e. events characterized by the propagation and amplification of a small number of initial failures that , due to non - linearity of the system , assume system - wide extent .",
    "this is true even for systems described by linear equations , since most failures ( like breaking a pipe or tripping a line ) correspond to discontinuous variations of the system parameters , i.e. are a strong non - linear event .",
    "this is a typical example of emergent behavior leading to one of the most important challenges in a network - centric word , i.e. systemic risk .",
    "an example of systemic risk in @xmath0s are the occurrence of blackout in one of the most developed and sophisticated system , i.e. power networks .",
    "it is important to notice that if such large outages were intrinsically due to an emergent behaviour of the electric power systems , increasing the accuracy of power systems simulation would not necessarily lead to better predictions of black - outs .",
    "power grids can be considered an example of complex networks@xciteand hence cascading failures in complex networks @xcite is field with important overlaps with system engineering and critical infrastructures protection ; however , most of the cascading model are based on local rules that are not appropriate to describe systems like power grids @xcite that , due to long range interactions , require a different approach @xcite    .",
    "another import issue is increasing interdependent among critical infrastructures    @xcite ; seminal papers have pointed out the possibility of the occurrence of catastrophic cascades across interdependent networks @xcite . however , there is still room for increasing the realism of such models@xcite , especially in the case of electric grids or gas pipelines . in this paper",
    "we move a preliminary step in such direction , trying to capture the systemic effect for coupled networks with long range interactions .",
    "to highlight the possibility of emergent behavior , we will first abstract @xmath0s in order to understand the basic mechanisms that could drive systemic failures ; in particular , we will consider finite capacity networks where a commodity ( a scalar quantity ) is produced at source nodes , consumed at load nodes and distributed as a kirchoff flow ( e.g. fluxes are conserved ) .",
    "for such systems , we will first introduce a simplified model that is amenable of a self - consistent analytical solution .",
    "subsequently , we will extended such model to the case of several coupled networks and study the cascading behavior under increasing stress ( i.e. increasing flow magnitudes ) .    in section [ sec : model ]",
    ", we develop our simplified model of overload cascades first in isolated ( sec .",
    "[ sec:1sys ] ) and coupled systems ( sec .",
    "[ sec : coupledsys ] ) . in particular , in subsection [ sec : kirchoff ]",
    ", we introduce the concept of flow network with a finite capacity and relate conservation laws to kirchoff s equations and to the presence of long range correlation . to account for such correlations , in subsection [ sec:1sys ]",
    "we introduce a mean field model for the cascade failures of flow networks ; in subsection [ sec : coupledsys ] , we extend the model to the case of several interacting systems .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : discuss ] we discuss and summarize our results .",
    "let s consider a network @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the node set , @xmath6 is the set of edges and @xmath7 is the vector characterizing the capacities of the edges @xmath8 .",
    "we associate to the nodes a vector @xmath9 that characterize the production ( @xmath10 ) or the consumption ( @xmath11 ) of a commodity .",
    "we further assume that there are no losses in the network ( i.e. @xmath12 ) ; hence , the total load on the network is    @xmath13    the distribution of the commodity is described by the fluxes @xmath14 on the edges @xmath15 that are supposed to respect kirchoff equations , i.e.    @xmath16    the relation among fluxes and demand / load is described by constitutive equations @xmath17 where in general eq.[eq : constitutive ] is non - linear but satisfies eq.[eq : kirchoff ] .",
    "the finite capacity @xmath18 constrains the maximum flux on link @xmath8 @xmath19 above which the link will cease functioning . as an example ,",
    "power lines are tripped ( disconnected ) when power flow goes beyond a certain threshold . since flows will redistribute after a link failure",
    ", it could happen that other lines get above their flow threshold and hence consequently fail , eventually leading to a cascade of failures . a typical algorithm to calculate the consequences of an initial set of line failures @xmath20failed@xmath21",
    "is the alg.[alg : net_cascade ] .    set initial failures @xmath22",
    "@xmath23    @xmath24    calculate flows @xmath25    calculate new failures @xmath26",
    "@xmath27    @xmath28    [ alg : net_cascade ]    here @xmath29 calculates the flows subject to the constrains that flows are zero in the failure set of edges @xmath30 .    to develop a general model that helps us understanding the class of failures that can affect kirchoff - like flow networks ,",
    "let s start from rewriting eq.[eq : kirchoff ] in matrix form    @xmath31    using the incidence matrix @xmath32 that associates to each link @xmath8 its nodes @xmath33 and @xmath34 and vice - versa .",
    "@xmath32 is an @xmath35 matrix where each column corresponds to an edge @xmath8 ; its columns are zero - sum and the only two non - zero elements have modulus @xmath36 and are on the @xmath37 and on the @xmath38 row .",
    "the matrix @xmath32 is related to the laplacian @xmath39 of the system ; in particular , it shares the same right eigenvalues and the same spectrum ( up to a squaring operations ) ; hence , it is a long - range operator since perturbation on a node of the system can be reflected on nodes far away on the network @xcite .      due to the long range nature of kirchoff s equations , to understand the qualitative behavior of such networks we can resort to a mean field model of flow networks where one assumes that when a link fails , its flow is re - distributed equally among all other links .",
    "subsequently , the lines above their threshold would trip again , their flows would be re - distributed and so on , up to convergence ; recalling that @xmath40 is the total load of the system and assuming the each link @xmath8 has an initial flux @xmath41 , we can describe such a model by alg.[alg : mfcascading ] .",
    "such model , introduced in @xcite , is akin to the fiber - bundle model @xcite and has been considered in more details in @xcite for the case of a single system . while similar in spirit to the cascade model for black - outs @xcite , it yelds different results since it does not describe the statistic of the cascades in power systems but concentrates on the order of the transition in a single system .",
    "@xmath23    @xmath42 initial number of failed links    @xmath24    @xmath43 number of working links    @xmath44 average flux on the working links    @xmath45    @xmath46    [ alg : mfcascading ]    such algorithm can be cast in the form of a single equation in the case where the system is composed by a large number of elements with capacity @xmath47 .",
    "in fact , in such limit we can describe the links population by the probability distribution function @xmath48 of their capacities .",
    "indicating with @xmath49 the initial number of links , we see that if we apply an overall load @xmath40 to the system , all the links will be initially subject to a flow @xmath50 .",
    "thus , a fraction of links @xmath51 would immediately fail , since their thresholds are lower than the flux @xmath52 they should sustain .",
    "after the first stage of a cascade , there will be @xmath53 surviving links and the new load per link is @xmath54 .",
    "the following cascade s stages follow analogously ; we can thus write the mean field equations for the @xmath55 stage of the cascade : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the initial load per link and @xmath58 is the cumulative distribution function of link capacities ; the initial conditions are @xmath59 .",
    "the fix - point @xmath60 of eq.[eq : mfmodel1sys ] satisfies the equation    @xmath61    and represents the total fraction of links broken at the end of the cascading stages @xcite .",
    "the behavior of @xmath60 depends on the functional form of @xmath62 .",
    "in particular , following@xcite we can define @xmath63 and @xmath64 and we have that @xmath65 so that we can rewrite eq.([eq : mfmodel1sys ] ) as @xmath66 equation ( [ eq : dasilveira ] ) has a trivial fix - point @xmath67 ( representing a total breakdown of the system ) since @xmath68 .",
    "such fix - point is unstable for @xmath69 and becomes stable for @xmath70 .",
    "we notice that if @xmath71 does not change convexity ( i.e. has no bumps ) and the transition is first order , the system will breakdown directly to the total collapsed state @xmath72 .",
    "in general , the behavior of the fix - point @xmath73 depends on the tail of the distribution @xmath48 and is known to present a first order transition for a wide family of curves @xcite .",
    "depending on the functional form of @xmath62 , eq.([eq : fixpoint1sys ] ) could sometimes be solved analytically .",
    "otherwise , the fix - point of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fixpoint1sys ] ) can be solved numerically either by iterating the eq .",
    "( [ eq : mfmodel1sys ] ) or by finding the zeros of eq.([eq : fixpoint1sys ] ) by newton - raphson iterations .",
    "notice that , if the system is long range , modelling cascade via homogeneous load redistribution allows to capture the order of the transition even when it gives not an accurate prediction of the actual location of the transition point .",
    "an example of such accordance for the case of power networks is given in @xcite , where both synthetic networks , realistic networks and mean - field systems show a first order transition .",
    "commodities are defined substitutable when they can be used for the same aim ; when commodities are substitutable , they can expressed in the same units .",
    "an example of such commodities are electricity and gas , since both can be used for domestic heating .",
    "hence , an increase on the cost of the gas ( as the one that has been recently experienced by ukraine ) could induce stress on the electric network of the country since most customer will possibly switch to the cheaper energy vector . to take account for such effects , we will extend the model described by eq.([eq : mfmodel1sys ] ) to the case of several coupled systems that transport substitutable commodities .",
    "we will consider @xmath74 coupled systems assuming that when a system @xmath75 is subject to some failures , it sheds a fraction @xmath76 of the induced flow increase on system @xmath77 .",
    "in other words , after failure system @xmath75 decreases its stress by a quantity @xmath78 by increasing the load of all other systems @xmath79 by @xmath80 .",
    "thus , the @xmath74 coupled systems are described by a set of @xmath74 equations of the form of eq.([eq : mfmodel1sys ] ) @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the load per link experimented by system @xmath75 in the @xmath83 stage of the cascade and @xmath84 is the cumulative of the probability distribution function @xmath85 for the capacities of the @xmath86 system .",
    "equations ( [ eq : mfmanysys ] ) are not independent , since the systems coupling is reflected by the dependence of @xmath82 on the fractions @xmath87 of failed links in all the other systems , i.e. @xmath88 where @xmath89 has the form of a laplacian operator .",
    "thus , the full equations for @xmath74 coupled systems are @xmath90 .    for simplicity , from now on we will consider the case of two identical systems with a uniform distribution of link capacities .",
    "notice that for a single system the transition is first order unless the probability distribution of the capacities is a power - law @xcite  an event that is not realistic for real world flow networks .",
    "since the functional form of @xmath91 is easy to recover for a uniform distribution , we can solve the fix - point of eq.([eq : mfmanysysfull ] ) numerically by iterating the equations up to convergence ; an alternative methodology would be using newton - raphson algorithms .",
    "we show in fig.([fig:2behaviours ] ) the cascading behavior of two coupled systems ; we observe that  as in the single system case  transitions are in the form of abrupt jumps , i.e. are first order .",
    "let s rewrite eq.([eq : mfmanysysfull ] ) in the case of symmetric couplings @xmath92 and same probability distribution for the capacities @xmath93\\right)\\\\ f_{2}^{t+1}=p\\left(\\frac{l_{1}}{1-f_{2}^{t}}\\left[1-t\\left(f_{2}-\\frac{l_{1}}{l_{2}}f_{1}\\right)\\right]\\right ) \\end{array}\\right.\\label{eq : mf2syssymm}\\ ] ]    if the two systems described by eq.([eq : mf2syssymm ] ) are stressed at the same pace ( i.e. @xmath94 ) , we get the case @xmath95\\right)\\\\ f_{2}^{t+1}=p\\left(\\frac{l}{1-f_{2}^{t}}\\left[1+t\\delta",
    "f_{12}\\right]\\right ) \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] ; from the symmetric solution @xmath96 we see that the breakdown of both systems happen at the same critical load as the uncoupled systems .",
    "such situation is shown in the left panel of fig.([fig:2behaviours ] ) .    in the general",
    ", only one of the systems will be the first one to break down ( i.e. the fraction of broken links jumps to @xmath97 ) : correspondingly , also the other systems will experience a jump in the number of broken links .",
    "let s consider the symmetric case described by equations ( [ eq : mf2syssymm ] ) and suppose that @xmath98 , so that system @xmath36 is the first to breakdown ( i.e. @xmath99 ) ; hence , the equation for the fix - point of the second system becomes @xmath100\\right)=p\\left(\\frac{l^{+}}{1-f_{2}^{*}}\\right)\\ ] ]    i.e. the system behaves like a single system starting with a renormalized load @xmath101>l$ ] .",
    "thus , if @xmath102 ( the critical value of eq.([eq : mfmodel1sys ] ) , system @xmath103 will break down at higher values of the stress . such situation is shown in the right panel of fig.([fig:2behaviours ] ) .    in fig.([fig",
    ": phasediagrams ] ) we show the full phase diagrams of two coupled systems while varying the coupling among them .",
    "according to the initial loads , we can distinguish an area @xmath104 near the origin where the system is safe and three separate cascade regimes : @xmath105 and @xmath106 , where either system @xmath36 or @xmath103 fails , and @xmath107 where both systems fail .",
    "we notice that , by increasing the coupling among the systems , both the area @xmath104 where the two systems are safe and the area @xmath107 where they fail together grow ; accordingly , the areas @xmath108 where only one system fails shrink .",
    "we have introduced a model for cascade failures due to the redistribution of flows upon overload of link capacities .",
    "for such a model , we have developed a mean field approximation both for the case of a single network and for the case of coupled networks .",
    "our model is inspired to a possible configuration for future power systems where network nodes the so - called energy hubs @xcite , i.e. points where several energy vectors converge and where energy demand / supply can be satisfied converting one kind of energy in another .",
    "hubs condition , transform and deliver energy in order to cover consumer needs @xcite . in such configurations , one can alleviate the stress on a network by using the flows of the the other energy vectors ; on the other hand , transferring loads from a network to the other can trigger cascades that can eventually backfire .    by analyzing the case of two coupled systems and",
    "by varying the strength of the interactions among them , we have shown that at low stresses coupling has a beneficial effect since some of the loads are shed to the other systems , thus postponing the occurrence of cascading failures .",
    "on the other hand , with the introduction of couplings the region where not only one system fails but both systems fail together also increases .",
    "the higher the couplings , the more the two systems behave like a single one and the area where only a system has failed shrinks .",
    "our model also applies to the realistic scenario where existent grids gets connected to allow power to be delivered across states ; such scenario has inspired the analysis of @xcite that , even using an unrealistic model of power redistribution in electric grids , reaches conclusion that are similar to ours .",
    "it is worth noting that while fault propagation models do predict a general lowering of the threshold for coupled systems @xcite , in the present model a beneficial effect due to the existence of the interdependent networks is observed for small enough overloads , while the expected cascading effects take place only for large initial disturbances .",
    "this picture is consistent with the observed phenomena for interdependent electric systems .",
    "moreover the existence of interlinks among different networks may increase their synchronization capabilities @xcite .",
