    "the no - slip boundary condition of fluid mechanics states that the velocity of a viscous flow vanishes near a stationary solid surface @xcite . although it has been a crucial ingredient of our understanding of fluid mechanics for more than a century , it has been much debated in the past @xcite , and , in the case of liquids , a complete physical picture for its origin has yet to be given .",
    "the ongoing debate stems from the fact that it is an assumption which can not be derived from first principles .",
    "it has been shown that on length scales much larger than the scale of surface heterogeneities , the no - slip condition might be a macroscopic consequence of inevitable microscopic roughness @xcite , but the case of perfectly smooth surfaces has yet to be explained .",
    "in particular , the physico - chemical properties of both the fluid and the solid surface certainly are important .",
    "only a few experimental studies have addressed the no - slip condition in the past @xcite , and it is only the recent advances in the controlled fabrication of micro- and nano - devices and in the corresponding measurement techniques that have allowed the problem to be reconsidered . over the last few years , a number of pressure - driven flow @xcite , shear - flow @xcite , and squeeze - flow experiments @xcite showing a response interpretable as some degree of slip for partially wetting liquids have been reported .",
    "molecular dynamics simulations of lennard - jones liquids have also shown that slip can occur , but only at unrealistically high shear rates @xcite .",
    "fluid slip is usually quantified by a slip length @xmath0 .",
    "let us consider for simplicity a unidirectional flow past a solid surface .",
    "following navier @xcite , the slip length linearly relates the surface slip velocity to the shear rate of the fluid evaluated at the surface @xmath1 the slip length can also be interpreted as the fictitious distance below the surface at which the velocity would be equal to zero if extrapolated linearly : the no - slip boundary condition is equivalent to @xmath2 and a no - shear boundary condition is equivalent @xmath3 .",

    "the first consists in performing indirect measurements , such as pressure - drop versus flow rate or squeezing rate versus resistance , and then use such measurements to infer a slip length .",
    "this procedure is indirect in the sense that it assumes that the flow resembles and then equation , or an equivalent , is used to determine @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the second way consists in performing direct velocity measurements in the fluid .",

    "@xcite measured velocities in shear flow of hexadecane over a smooth surface using a technique based on fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the measurements were performed down to 80 nm from the solid surface and averaged over a few tens of microns .",
    "fluid slip was observed with @xmath9 nm in the case of lyophobic surfaces .",
    "tretheway & meinhart ( 2001 ) @xcite used micro - particle image velocimetry ( piv ) techniques to measure the velocities of tracer nanoparticles ( radius 150 nm ) in pressure - driven channel flow of water .",
    "measurements were made down to 450 nm from the solid surface and cross - correlated to increase signal - to - noise ratios .",
    "results consistent with the no - slip condition were obtained in completely wetting conditions , but slip with @xmath10 @xmath11 m was obtained when the channel walls were treated to be hydrophobic .    in this paper",
    ", we wish to draw attention to some of the possible consequences of this latter type of particle - based measurements .",
    "we address theoretically a prototypical pressure - driven flow experiment in small channels in the case where small tracer particles are used to probe the fluid velocity .",
    "we show that if electrical effects for both the channel and the particles are properly taken into account , it is possible for the particles to behave as if they were advected by a flow with a finite non - zero slip length , even if the velocity profile in the fluid surrounding the particle does not violate the no - slip condition .    in the following section we summarize some important background electrostatics and hydrodynamics results ,",
    "derive the formulae in the case of two dimensional channels and introduce the electroviscous effect . in section",
    "[ suspended ] we present a physical picture for the effect we report , derive the expressions for the apparent slip lengths and give the conditions for the occurrence of such slip .",
    "finally , in section [ discussion ] we discuss implications of these results along with estimates of their order of magnitude under typical experimental conditions and compare with experiments .",
    "the physical picture for the effect we wish to introduce relies on the following known facts .",
    "a solid surface in contact with an electrolyte solution will in general acquire a net charge , due for example to the ionization of surface groups , ion adsorption and/or dissolution .",
    "this surface charge is a thermodynamic property of the solid - electrolyte pair and the reader is referred to @xcite for detailed presentations of the phenomenon .",
    "the equilibrium surface potential is called the zeta potential @xmath12 .",
    "such surface charges are screened by a diffusive cloud of counter - ions in the solution . at equilibrium ,",
    "the electrostatic potential @xmath13 in the electrolyte satisfies the poisson - boltzmann equation which quantifies the balance between purely electrostatic interactions and diffusion @xcite , @xmath14 where we consider here for simplification only the case of monovalent 1:1 ions , e.g. na@xmath15 and cl@xmath16 or oh@xmath16 and h@xmath15 .",
    "a convenient approximation usually made to solve is the debye - hckel approximation @xcite of small field strength , @xmath17 , in which case the equation simplifies to the linearized poisson - boltzmann equation @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the debye screening length : it is the typical length scale in the solution over which counter - ions screen the charged solid surface , and beyond which the net charge density is essentially zero .",
    "however , is restricted to low surface potentials , typically 20mv , which is a severe approximation .",
    "let us consider for simplicity the case of a two - dimensional channel of height @xmath4 in the @xmath20-direction and let us instead derive the solution to for any value of the zeta potential at the wall @xmath21 but in the limit where the channel dimensions are much larger than the double layers @xmath22 .",
    "this limit is appropriate for channel sizes down to @xmath23 @xmath11 m in the case of pure water , or even @xmath24 nm in the case of tap water .",
    "let us define the dimensionless potential @xmath25 and the dimensionless vertical coordinate @xmath26 . in this case",

    "since @xmath29 , the solution to equation involves boundary layers near @xmath30 .",
    "the outer solution @xmath31 is found by taking the limit @xmath32 in and we find @xmath33 .",
    "the inner solution @xmath34 is valid near the boundaries for @xmath35 , in which case reduces to the poisson - boltzmann equation near an infinite plane , whose solution is @xcite @xmath36 finally , since @xmath33 , the inner solution is also equal to the composite solution @xmath37 , uniformly valid throughout the channel as @xmath38 , at leading order in @xmath39 . for convenience ,",
    "equation can be rewritten as @xmath40 where we have defined @xmath41 .",
    "when a pressure - driven flow occurs in the channel , the fluid velocity is unidirectional @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the streamwise direction . in the absence of electrical effects , the fluid velocity is simply poiseuille s pressure - driven formula @xcite , which we will denote @xmath44 , and is given by @xmath45\\cdot\\ ] ]    furthermore , if an external , or induced , electric field @xmath46 is also applied to the channel , the presence of a net charge density near the solid surface moving in response to the field leads to an additional velocity component known as electroosmotic flow ( eof ) @xcite .",
    "it is directed in the @xmath47-direction , is given by @xmath48,\\ ] ] and is valid for any value of @xmath21 .",
    "as the electrolyte solution flows down a pressure gradient , the cloud of counter - ions is advected by the flow and a streaming current is established . if no short - circuit is present between the two ends of the capillary , accumulation of charge sets up a potential difference along the channel , termed the `` streaming potential '' .",
    "such potential , or equivalently electric field , opposes the mechanical transfer of charge by creating a reverse conduction current through the bulk solution such that the total net electric current is zero .",
    "this induced axial electric field scales with the applied pressure gradient and leads to the creation of an induced electroosmotic back - flow which effectively slows down the fluid motion in the capillary : a smaller flow rate for a given pressure drop is obtained than in the regular poiseuille case , as if the liquid had a higher shear viscosity than expected .",
    "consequently this effect is usually referred to as the primary `` electroviscous effect '' @xcite .",

    "fluid slip , as illustrated in figure [ figure ] .",
    "for the same reason as for the capillary surfaces , these particles will usually be charged in solution .",
    "as they are advected by the fluid motion , they will also feel the influence of the induced streaming electric field : consequently their velocity will not only reproduce that of the fluid but will also include an induced electrophoretic component @xcite , proportional to their zeta potential and the streaming electric field . if the zeta potential of a particle has a sign opposite to that of the capillary surface , the particle will be slowed down by the electric field . on the contrary , if the particle possesses a potential of the same sign as the capillary surface , its electrophoretic component will be in the streamwise direction ; furthermore , if its zeta potential is large enough , the electrophoretic velocity of the particle will be able to overcome the induced electroosmotic back - flow .",
    "it then follows that there is a significant potential implication of the induced electric field : if one were to conduct an experiment in such conditions without considering any important electrical effects , these particles would go faster than the expected poiseuille pressure - driven profile , leading to the incorrect conclusion that the velocity profile has a non - zero slip velocity at the wall .",

    "we also assume for simplicity that the presence of the particle does not modify the nature of ionic groups in solution ( 1:1 monovalent ions ) , so that the screening lengths @xmath19 for the charged particle and the charged channel surface are the same , as given by equation",

    "such a requirement would also have to be verified in an experiment , otherwise the presence of the wall would hinder some component of the measured slip velocity . note that if walls were not present , a correction to the velocity accounting for the finite size of the particle and the spatial variations of the fluid velocity would also be present , but only at second order in the ratio of the particle size to the length scale over which flow variations occur @xcite .",

    "the velocity also includes the electroosmotic back - flow resulting from the motion of excess charges near the channel walls and proportional to the wall zeta potential @xmath21 .",
    "furthermore , the presence of a wall always influences the electrophoretic mobility at cubic order in the ratio of the particle size to the distance to the wall , as long as double layers do not overlap @xcite ; since we already assumed the particle to be located far from the wall , we will neglect the wall influence here as well .",

    "moreover , since @xmath127 and @xmath128 , and since @xmath129 varies only weakly with @xmath130 , we see from that the @xmath0 is a decreasing function of the ionic strength .",

    "we have reported in this paper the following new mechanism . when small charged colloidal particles are used in a pressure - driven flow experiment to probe the profile of the velocity field of an electrolyte solution ( e.g. p.i.v . in water ) , their velocities may include an `` apparent slip '' component even though the velocity field in the fluid does not violate the no - slip boundary condition .",
    "this apparent slip is in fact an electrophoretic velocity for the particles which are subject to the streaming potential , _",
    "i.e. _ , the flow - induced potential difference that builds up along the channel due to the advection of free screening charges by the flow .",
    "a similar effect is expected to occur in shear - driven flows .",
    "the expected maximum orders of magnitude for the apparent slip lengths were given under normal conditions in water .",
    "although the effect was found to be too small to explain the data reported in @xcite , its magnitude is consistent with other indirect investigations of fluid slip in pressure - driven flow experiments . as a consequence , the analysis presented here could be a useful tool for experimentalists by allowing them to estimate quantitatively the importance of this apparent slip in their experiments .",
    "the idea that free passive particles could go faster than the surrounding flowing liquid , although counter - intuitive at first , is in fact not unnatural : a similar phenomenon occurs in electrophoresis where , beyond the double layer , the ambient liquid is at rest .",
    "we also note from equation and the scalings presented above that the effect increases when the ionic strength of the solution , and therefore its conductivity , decreases ; this is because flow of an electrolyte with low ion concentration will necessary lead to the induction of a large streaming electric field to counteract the advection - of - charge electric current .    the model chosen for the calculations used several simplifying assumptions .",
    "our calculations were two - dimensional and we neglected in the model the effect of surface conductance as well as interactions between particles .",
