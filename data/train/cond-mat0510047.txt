    "a magnetic nanoparticle exhibits many interesting and challenging novel properties such as exponentially slow relaxation at low temperature and superparamagnetic behavior above some temperature that depends on the particle s size and its underlying material .",
    "the magnetization of a superparamagnetic particle shuttles in a fast motion between the various anisotropy - energy minima .",
    "the stability of the magnetization against this thermally - activated reversal has become a crucial issue in fundamental research as well as in technological applications .",
    "controlling this behavior , in view of room temperature applications , requires a fair understanding of the magnetization dynamics at the nanosecond time scale .",
    "there are two competing approaches to the study of the static and dynamic properties of a nanoparticle .",
    "i ) _ one - spin particle _ ( osp ) : a macroscopic approach that models a nanoparticle as a single magnetic moment , assuming coherent rotation of all atomic magnetic moments , and is exemplified by the stoner - wohlfarth model for statics and nel - brown model for dynamics @xcite .",
    "ii ) _ many - spin particle _ ( msp ) : this microscopic approach involves the atomic magnetic moment with continuous degrees of freedom as its building block .",
    "it allows taking account of the local environment inside the particle , including the microscopic interactions and single - site anisotropy @xcite .",
    "this approach becomes necessary when dealing with a very small nanoparticle because the spin non - collinearities induced by strong boundary effects and surface anisotropy invalidate the coherent - rotation assumption . however , investigating the dynamics of an msp is a real challenge .",
    "indeed , within this approach one is faced with complex many - body aspects with the inherent difficulties related with analysing the energyscape ( location of the minima , maxima , and saddle points of the energy potential ) .",
    "this analysis is unavoidable since it is a crucial step in the calculation of the relaxation time and thereby in the study of the magnetization stability against thermally - activated reversal .",
    "one may then address the question as to whether there exist some cases in which the full - fledged theory that has been developed for the osp approach [ see @xcite and references therein ] can still be used to describe an msp .",
    "however , avoiding somehow the spin non - collinearities induced by surface / interface anisotropy means that some price has to be paid . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that when the surface anisotropy is much smaller than the exchange coupling , and in the absence of core anisotropy , the surface anisotropy contribution to the particle s energy is of @xmath0-order in the net magnetization components and @xmath1-order in the surface anisotropy constant .",
    "this means that the energy of an msp with relatively weak surface anisotropy can be modeled by that of an osp whose effective energy contains an additional cubic - anisotropy potential .",
    "it is the purpose of this work to extend the ( numerical ) result of ref .   to include core anisotropy",
    "this is achieved by computing minor hysteresis loops , net magnetization components as functions of the field , and energyscape in 2 and 3 dimensions .",
    "we find that because of surface anisotropy the minimum defined by the core uniaxial anisotropy splits into 4 minima , reminiscent of cubic anisotropy .",
    "we then show that the energyscape can be modeled by an effective energy of the net particle s magnetization containing a uniaxial- and cubic - anisotropy terms .",
    "we also show that this result holds for two different models of surface anisotropy ( transverse and nel ) .",
    "we consider a spherical particle of @xmath2 spins cut from a cube of side @xmath3 ( i.e. , @xmath4 atomic spacings ) with simple cubic lattice structure .",
    "due to the underlying ( discrete ) lattice structure , the particle thus obtained is not a sphere with smooth boundary because its outer shell presents apices , steps , and facets , resulting in many sites with different coordination numbers .",
    "our model hamiltonian is the ( classical ) anisotropic dirac - heisenberg model  @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the unit spin vector on site @xmath7 , @xmath8 the uniform magnetic field , @xmath2 the total number of spins ( core and surface ) , and @xmath9 the nearest - neighbor ferromagnetic exchange coupling .",
    "@xmath10 is the uniaxial single - site anisotropy energy @xmath11 with easy axis @xmath12 and constant @xmath13 .",
    "if the spin at site @xmath14 is in the core , the anisotropy axis @xmath12 is taken along the reference @xmath15 axis and @xmath16 . for surface spins , this axis is along the radial ( i.e. , transverse to the cluster surface ) direction and @xmath17 . in this case , the model in ( [ uaa ] ) for surface spins is called the transverse surface anisotropy ( tsa ) model .",
    "we use the more general model of transverse direction given by the gradient [ the vector perpendicular to the isotimic surface @xmath18 defining the shape of the particle , e.g. a sphere or an ellipsoid ] , because in the case of a spherical particle the transverse and radial directions coincide , whereas for another geometry such as an ellipsoid they do not . a more physically appealing microscopic model of surface anisotropy",
    "was introduced by nel @xcite with @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the coordination number of site @xmath7 and @xmath21 is the unit vector connecting the site @xmath7 to its nearest neighbors .",
    "this model is more realistic since the anisotropy at a given site occurs only when the latter loses some of its neighbors , i.e. when it is located on the boundary .",
    "the model in ( [ nsa ] ) will be referred to as the nel surface anisotropy ( nsa ) model @xcite .",
    "qualitatively , the nsa model is not quite different from the tsa model .",
    "for example , consider a site @xmath7 sitting on a @xmath22 $ ] facet , e.g. in the upper most plane normal to the @xmath15 axis .",
    "it has @xmath23 neighbors on that facet and one below it along the @xmath15 axis . from ( [ nsa ] ) ,",
    "the corresponding energy reads    @xmath24 \\\\ & = & k_s\\left[2s_{i , x}^{2 } + 2s_{i , y}^{2 } + s_{i , z}^{2}\\right ]   = 2 k_s - k_s\\,s_{i , z}^{2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where we have used @xmath25 .",
    "this implies that if @xmath26 the easy direction is along @xmath27 , i.e. , normal to the facet , and if @xmath28 the facet becomes an easy plane .",
    "therefore , upon dropping the irrelevant constant , we rewrite the above energy as @xmath29 which is the same as the tsa in eq .",
    "( [ uaa ] ) for the site considered . more generally , averaging the nsa over a surface perpendicular to the direction @xmath30 leads to [ see eqs .",
    "( 6 , 7 ) in ref .  ]",
    "@xmath31 thus favoring among @xmath32 the direction closest to the surface normal .",
    "this explains the similarity between the results obtained with tsa and nsa .",
    "using the components @xmath33 , the atomic surface density reads @xcite @xmath34 and thereby we have the particular cases @xmath35 for comparison , taking account of the atomic surface density , the tsa model is described by @xmath36 and the whole effect comes from the atomic surface density .",
    "quantitatively , in the nsa model the effect is bigger , since for the surface cut perpendicular to the grand diagonal of the cubic lattice the anisotropy completely disappears , whereas in ( [ esperp ] ) the surface anisotropy is only reduced by the factor @xmath37 .    because we are dealing with an msp",

    "[ enscape_field_phi ] , [ mag_cc ] , we see that the orientation of the particle s net magnetization varies according to the following scenario : it starts in the minimum defined by the positive saturation state , i.e. , @xmath69 .",
    "as the field decreases towards negative values , this orientation drifts towards the @xmath15 axis ( @xmath70 ) , as confirmed by the increasing @xmath71 in fig .",
    "[ mag_cc ] ( circles ) .",
    "this continues until the field reaches the value @xmath72 .",
    "note that the net magnetization stays in the @xmath73 plane containing the field direction .",

    "this occurs through a saddle point in the @xmath75 direction as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ enscape_field_phi ] ( right ) .",
    "as the field further decreases , this direction goes towards the @xmath76 axis , but still with @xmath77 .",
    "when we cycle back from the field value @xmath64 across the value @xmath78 , the direction of @xmath38 goes through another saddle point and so does not jump back to @xmath79 but continues towards the @xmath15 axis until the field reaches the value @xmath80 at which it jumps to the state marked by symbols within circles in fig .",
    "[ mag_cc ] .",
    "in fact , this is the only state in which the net magnetization goes out of the @xmath73 plane . from the latter state , the direction of the net magnetization jumps back to the initial state .",
    "it is clear that this scenario should be dependent on the energyscape , and thereby on the particle s size ( see fig .  [ loops_minor_size ] ) and surface anisotropy ( constant and model ) .",
    "nonetheless , it shows that surface anisotropy induces more minima and saddle points in the energyscape , and thereby more paths along which the direction of the net magnetization can evolve as the field is varied .",
    "the results discussed above suggest that the msp may be represented by an effective magnetic moment [ as is done in the so called macro - spin approximation @xcite ] which is just the net magnetic moment of the particle in an effective anisotropy potential .",
    "indeed , in @xcite it was shown that when the surface anisotropy is smaller than exchange , in the absence of core anisotropy , the surface anisotropy contribution to the particle s energy is of @xmath0 order in the net magnetization components and second order in the surface anisotropy constant , and is proportional to a surface integral .",
    "now , we may ask the question as to what happens in the presence of core anisotropy .",

    "the four minima exist over a finite range of applied field , although their positions change continuously as a function of the field .",
    "they can explain the minor loop of fig .",
    "[ loops_full_vs_minor ] as follows : in the upper branch of the loop ( structures @xmath95 and @xmath96 in fig .",

    "the only minimum with the magnetization out of the @xmath73 plane , namely @xmath106 [ marked by circles in fig .",
    "[ mag_cc ] ] , is reached when the field is swept up , but not when it is swept down .",
    "this asymmetry is due to the fact that the field is applied in the direction @xmath107 , which is closer to the minimum @xmath97 than to the other three .",

    "this simple fitting shows that even for the seemingly strong surface anisotropy ( @xmath119 ) and large surface - to - volume ratio ( @xmath120 here ) , the surface contribution to the effective energy remains smaller than the contribution of the uniaxial core anisotropy ( @xmath121 ) .",

    "the results above agree and complement those of ref .   and , where it was shown that for the tsa and nsa there exists a ( different ) critical value of the surface anisotropy constant that separates i ) the osp stoner - wohlfarth regime of coherent switching and ii ) the msp regime where the strong spin non - collinearities invalidate the coherent mechanism , and the particle",

    "however , one should not forget that this effective constant depends on the particle s size , among other parameters such as the material composition , and for , e.g. a diameter of @xmath130 nm we may expect higher anisotropies .",

    "a fit to the @xmath82 stoner - wohlfarth astroid leads to a @xmath134-order term an order of magnitude smaller than the @xmath135-order one .",
    "the results of the present work could be useful for investigating the thermally activated reversal of a small nanoparticle .",
    "indeed , the effective osp with the energy ( [ uniaxialcubicenergy ] ) allows us to include surface effects , though in a phenomenological manner , while offering a considerable simplification as compared to the initial many - spin system .",
    "however , one should note that the effective potential contains a quartic term in the net magnetization components , which renders the analysis of the energyscape somewhat more involved but still feasible @xcite , as opposed to the case of a many - spin particle .",
    "in fact , for small enough surface anisotropy for which the effective energy ( [ uniaxialcubicenergy ] ) holds best , the minima are mainly defined by the uniaxial anisotropy and the effect of the cubic - anisotropy contribution is then to modify the loci of the saddle points and their number .",
    "this obviously renders the calculation of the relaxation rate rather involved @xcite . in the general case of arbitrary surface anisotropy intensity , one has to tackle the problem of computing the relaxation rates for a many - spin system with all the ensuing complexities .",
    "such difficulties are already encountered , in this context , in the much simpler situation of two exchange - coupled spins @xcite . obviously , the general situation can only be dealt with through numerical approaches ."
