    "inverse spectral geometry developed in consequence of kac s  @xcite famous question `` can one hear the shape of a drum ? '' .",
    "we consider broken _ _ drums , that is , drums whose drumheads are only partially attached .",
    "the drumhead is modelled as a compact flat manifold @xmath0 with piecewise smooth boundary @xmath1 .",
    "we choose disjoint open smooth subsets @xmath2 , representing the attached and unattached parts of the drumhead , such that @xmath3 the drumhead s displacement @xmath4 obeys the wave _ _ equation @xmath5 with mixed boundary _ _ conditions @xmath6 where @xmath7 denotes the normal derivative .",
    "separation leads to pure tones @xmath8 with audible frequencies @xmath9 , such that @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the interior of @xmath0 .",
    "the mixed eigenvalue problem is known as the zaremba problem , and it also occurs in string theory  @xcite .",
    "we recall that integration with respect to the riemannian measure gives rise to an inner product on @xmath12 , with hilbert space completion @xmath13 .",
    "henceforth , we only consider cases in which the following is satisfied .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath14 for which there exists @xmath15 satisfying   are given as an unbounded sequence @xmath16 and each eigenspace is finite dimensional .",
    "in addition , eigenspaces belonging to distinct eigenvalues are @xmath17-orthogonal , and @xmath13 is the hilbert direct sum of all the eigenspaces .    there is a rich literature on elliptic boundary value problems , and we refer to @xcite for the case of manifolds with corners , which covers all examples of the following sections .",
    "whenever the imposed boundary conditions are unambiguous , the sequence   will be called the spectrum _ _ of _ _ @xmath0 , and manifolds are called isospectral if their spectra coincide . the terms dirichlet _ _ isospectral _ _ and neumann _ _ isospectral _ _ refer to homogeneous _",
    "_ boundary _ _ conditions , that is , @xmath18 or @xmath19 .",
    "an inspection of the heat kernel shows that isospectral manifolds share basic properties such as dimension , volume , and difference of neumann boundary volume and dirichlet boundary volume  @xcite .",
    "prior to kac s question , milnor  @xcite found isospectral , non - isometric flat @xmath20-dimensional tori , which were also isolength spectral ( compare @xcite ) . in subsequent years , counterexamples to variations of kac s question followed  @xcite . motivated by results from number theory , sunada  @xcite developed a general technique to construct isospectral manifolds , which has been widely applied and extended  @xcite . using brard s extension to the orbifold setting , gordon  et  al .",
    "@xcite answered kac s question by constructing the dirichlet isospectral planar domains shown in figure  [ fig : firstisospectraldrums ] .",
    "buser  et  al .",
    "@xcite applied sunada s method to projective special linear groups .",
    "they found @xmath21 pairs of planar domains , whose isospectrality could also be verified by using the transplantation _",
    "_ method that had been developed earlier by buser  @xcite . roughly speaking ,",
    "one cuts each eigenfunction of one domain into pieces , and superposes these restrictions linearly on the blocks of the other domain in such a way that the resulting function is also an eigenfunction .",
    "this idea revealed that the isospectrality is independent of the shape of the underlying building block and only depends on the way in which its copies are glued together .",
    "replacing the heptagonal blocks in figure  [ fig : firstisospectraldrums ] by triangles yields the so - called gordon - webb - wolpert drums _ _ shown in figure  [ fig : isospectraldrumswithtriangles ] .",
    "their isospectrality has been confirmed experimentally using microwave cavities @xcite .",
    "this article continues the following recent developments . in  2001 ,",
    "okada and shudo  @xcite used buser s  @xcite idea of encoding gluing patterns by edge - coloured graphs to perfom a computer - aided search for transplantable pairs . in 2006 , levitin  et  al .",
    "@xcite applied the transplantation method to planar domains with mixed boundary conditions , which motivated the work of band  et  al .",
