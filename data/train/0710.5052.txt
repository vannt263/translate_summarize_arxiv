    "magnetic buoyancy applies in the literature for different situations ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the first corresponds to the magnetic buoyancy instability of stratified continuous magnetic field ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , and magnetic flux tube concept is not used there .",
    "the magnetic buoyancy instability of stratified continuous magnetic field is excited when the scale of variations of the initial magnetic field is less than the density stratification length . on the other hand ,",
    "buoyancy of discrete magnetic flux tubes has been discussed in a number of studies in solar physics and astrophysics ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this phenomenon is also related to the problem of the storage of magnetic fields in the overshoot layer near the bottom of the solar convective zone ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a universal mechanism of the formation of the nonuniform distribution of magnetic flux is associated with a magnetic flux expulsion . in particular , the expulsion of magnetic flux from two - dimensional flows ( a single vortex and a grid of vortices ) was demonstrated in @xcite . in the context of solar and stellar convection , the topological asymmetry of stationary thermal convection plays very important role in the magnetic field dynamics . in particular",
    ", the topological magnetic pumping is caused by the topological asymmetry of the thermal convection @xcite .",
    "the fluid rises at the centers of the convective cells and falls at their peripheries .",

    "the nonlinear drift velocities of the mean magnetic field in a turbulent convection have been determined in @xcite .",

    "for instance , a time - independent source of the turbulence exists in the sun .",
    "the mean nonuniform magnetic field causes an additional energy source of the turbulence , @xmath48 .",
    "the ratio @xmath49 of these two sources of turbulence is of the order of @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the characteristic scale of the spatial variations of the mean magnetic field . since @xmath52 and @xmath53",

    "however , the gain in the turbulent magnetic pressure @xmath13 is not as large as the reduction of the turbulent hydrodynamic pressure @xmath81 by the mean magnetic field @xmath39 .",
    "this is due to different coefficients multiplying by @xmath82 and @xmath83 in the equation of state  ( [ wa1 ] ) [ see also eq .",
