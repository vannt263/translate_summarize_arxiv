    "<S> the dynamics of excited electrons and holes in single layer ( sl ) mos@xmath0 have so far been difficult to disentangle from the excitons that dominate the optical response of this material . here , we use time- and angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy for a sl of mos@xmath0 on a metallic substrate to directly measure the excited free carriers . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to ascertain a direct quasiparticle band gap of 1.95  ev and determine an ultrafast ( 50  fs ) extraction of excited free carriers via the metal in contact with the sl mos@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this process is of key importance for optoelectronic applications that rely on separated free carriers rather than excitons . </S>",

    "<S> the optical properties of semiconductors are completely specified by the dynamics of free carriers and bound excitons , both stemming from electron - hole pair excitations @xcite . in bulk semiconductors such as gaas @xcite and two - dimensional ( 2d ) quantum well systems @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> these excitations have been studied for over half a century . </S>",
    "<S> recently , genuine 2d semiconductors such as single layer ( sl ) mos@xmath0 have been isolated @xcite . in these materials the low dimensionality contributes to the presence of strongly bound excitons @xcite with remarkable properties @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the current understanding of the optical properties and excited carrier dynamics in sl and few layer mos@xmath0 relies largely on a series of photoluminescence and differential absorption experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the electron - hole pair dynamics has been investigated through the measured exciton lines , which are the most prominent features in such experiments @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this approach has been remarkably successful leading to , for example , the demonstration of a valley polarization between optically induced excitons associated with the degenerate conduction band ( cb ) valleys in the material s band structure @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> time - resolved studies have revealed valuable insights into exciton lifetimes , including relaxation dynamics that evolve over femto- to picosecond timescales due to scattering processes involving lattice vibrations @xcite and defects @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , an important technological challenge remains : to separate the bound electron - hole pairs into free carriers that can then be extracted via metallic electrodes . </S>",
    "<S> this approach has recently been explored in complex 2d material heterostructures consisting of graphene and sl transition metal dichalcogenides ( tmdcs ) @xcite , paving the way towards efficient photovoltaic devices with improved absorption characteristics @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> while the all - optical studies of sl mos@xmath0 have unveiled the exciton physics in this material , the strong exciton - related features in the spectra mask the free carrier contribution to the optical properties almost entirely @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we overcome this issue by assessing the free carrier dynamics in sl mos@xmath0 with time- and angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( tr - arpes ) . for this study </S>",
    "<S> , we employ a model system consisting of high quality sl mos@xmath0 epitaxially grown on a au(111 ) substrate ( see sketch in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1](a ) ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> not only does this system allow us to quantify the direct band gap of free carriers in a sl of mos@xmath0 on au(111 ) , it permits us to measure free carrier lifetimes in sl mos@xmath0 near a metal contact - a configuration that is relevant to real device architectures @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> using tr - arpes to unravel the carrier dynamics near arbitrary points of a material s brillouin zone ( bz ) has only recently become possible with the advent of high photon energy laser light via high harmonic generation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is especially relevant for electronic states near the bz boundary , such as the dirac cone in graphene @xcite or , indeed , the cb and valence band ( vb ) extrema of sl mos@xmath0 , which are sketched in fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig:1](b)-[fig:1](d ) . in the tr - arpes experiment , </S>",
    "<S> the sample is first excited by an ultrashort tunable pump pulse , such that optical pumping can be achieved with energies below ( fig . [ fig:1](b ) ) , at ( fig . [ fig:1](c ) ) and above ( fig . [ fig:1](d ) ) the quasiparticle band gap . </S>",
    "<S> the system is then probed along the @xmath1 direction in the bz while in the excited state by photoemission using a time - delayed 25  ev probe pulse , as sketched in fig . [ fig:1](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> both pump and probe pulses have a duration of 30  fs .    [ t ! ]        the electronic structure of our sample at equilibrium </S>",
    "<S> is characterized by sharp dispersing vb features of sl mos@xmath0 with spin - orbit split bands around the vb maximum ( vbm ) at @xmath2 , as seen in the arpes data in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1](e ) @xcite . the location of the projected bulk band continuum and bulk gaps of the underlying au(111 ) </S>",
    "<S> have been added , because these will play a crucial role for the dynamics observed in the three different optical pumping regimes .    </S>",
    "<S> the non - equilibrium carrier distribution is displayed in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1](f)-[fig:1](h ) , which show the intensity difference between the spectrum immediately after the optical excitation ( 30  fs ) and a spectrum taken before the arrival of the pump pulse . in these difference plots , </S>",
    "<S> red and blue indicate an increase and decrease of spectral intensity , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> as expected , such a difference spectrum is rather featureless when the system is pumped with 1.6  ev , an energy well below the band gap ( fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig:1](f ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> when the excitation energy is increased to 2.0  ev , we observe a clear population of the cb states at @xmath2 , as seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1](g ) . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that our pump energy exceeds the band gap and excites free carriers into the cb , a point we return to below . </S>",
    "<S> this population strongly decreases when we excite with 3.0  ev photons ( fig . [ fig:1](h ) ) . for this excitation </S>",
    "<S> , one might expect a population of electronic states at higher energies in the cb and an eventual cascading down to the cb minimum ( cbm ) . in this scenario </S>",
    "<S> one would either expect that the intensity at the cbm would increase at a later point in time or that the rate of decay of electrons in the cbm would slow down . </S>",
    "<S> we are only able to observe weak signals at the cbm with the 3.0 ev pump pulse , which we attribute to the dual constraints of phase space restrictions imposed by energy and momentum conservation rules for photo excitation of mos@xmath0 at this energy and a shorter lifetime of the mos@xmath0 states excited within the continuum of metal bulk states . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is fully consistent with the increase of linewidth , and thus decrease of lifetime , of the vb states as they cross into the continuum of metal bulk states , which can be seen in the equilibrium arpes data in fig . [ fig:1](e ) and in the more detailed analysis of these states in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> [ t ! ]        the data in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1](g ) establish that optical pumping with 2.0  ev photons is required to resolve the cbm around @xmath2 and thus to observe the free carrier dynamics of sl mos@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we have therefore used this excitation energy while recording the time - resolved series of snapshots of this region of the bz . </S>",
    "<S> snapshots of this series are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2 ] while the quantitative intensity development is discussed later in connection with fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:4 ] . </S>",
    "<S> excited electrons and holes are already distributed around the vb and cb edges during the optical excitation phase at @xmath3 , i.e. at the centre of the pump pulse ( see fig . [ fig:2](a ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is ascribed to rapid carrier - carrier scattering . </S>",
    "<S> the peak excitation is reached at @xmath4  fs in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2](b ) ( see also fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:4 ] ) , where the full parabolic dispersions of the band extrema emerge due to the increased population of carriers . </S>",
    "<S> this then rapidly relaxes with the overall intensity difference already halved at @xmath5  fs in fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig:2](c ) and approaching the noise level at @xmath6  fs in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2](d ) . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2](e ) , at @xmath7  fs , no excited carriers can be seen .    </S>",
    "<S> the parabolic dispersion around the vb and cb edges can be extracted from the peak intensity difference at @xmath4  fs using the analysis introduced in fig . [ fig:2](f ) . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to extract values for the vb and cb offsets with respect to the fermi level , as indicated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2](e ) . </S>",
    "<S> we can therefore directly measure a free carrier direct quasiparticle band gap of ( @xmath8 )  ev , which is marked in fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig:2](f ) . </S>",
    "<S> this value is different from a previous estimate by high resolution arpes using the standard approach of populating the cb by alkali - doping @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we ascribe this to the possibility of a severe band distortion caused by alkali - mos@xmath0 bonding @xcite , inhomogeneous doping or band tailing effects . </S>",
    "<S> the observed gap is substantially smaller than a theoretically estimated value of 2.8  ev for free - standing mos@xmath0 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this can be explained by a strong renormalization of the band gap due to the metallic substrate . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , similar renormalization effects , although substantially weaker , have already been observed for 2d tmdcs grown on graphene on silicon carbide and graphite @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that the quasiparticle gap that we determine for excited free carriers here is a fundamentally different quantity from the optical gap that derives from the energy of the a exciton line . </S>",
    "<S> the size of the optical gap is around 1.9  ev for exfoliated mos@xmath0 placed on insulating substrates such as sio@xmath0/si@xcite and hbn / sio@xmath0/si@xcite . in our case , the close proximity of sl mos@xmath0 to the underlying metallic substrate is expected to cause a significant screening of the excitons@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this reduces the exciton binding energy , which may explain why the measured size of the quasiparticle gap for mos@xmath0 on au(111 ) nearly coincides with the optical gap for mos@xmath0 on sio@xmath0/si .    [ t ! ]    @xmath9 with respect to @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> an equilibrium edc obtained before optical excitation ( @xmath10 ) and an edc at the peak excitation ( @xmath4  fs ) are shown for comparison . </S>",
    "<S> the cb ( vb ) edge is identified via a small surplus ( depletion ) of intensity , which can also be seen by a peak ( dip ) in the plotted difference between the two edcs ( grey curve ) . </S>",
    "<S> the excitation process around the vb and cb edges is defined in the upper right diagram . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) plots of edcs integrated over @xmath11  @xmath9 with respect to @xmath2 as in ( a ) but at a photon energy of 3.0  ev , well above the gap energy ( see upper right diagram for definition of this process ) . </S>",
    "<S> a shift on the order of 10  mev between the two edcs is highlighted by a double - headed arrow . </S>",
    "<S> this is clearly visible via an increase in the difference curve around a binding energy of 1.0  ev.,scaledwidth=38.0% ]    a more detailed analysis of the photoemission intensity for a pump excitation with 2.0  ev photons is presented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the black and orange curves are energy distribution curves ( edcs ) of the photoemission intensity at @xmath10 and @xmath4  fs , respectively , integrated over the momentum range that contains the cb and vb edges . </S>",
    "<S> the edc at @xmath10 was obtained from a spectrum acquired 200  fs before the arrival of the optical excitation . </S>",
    "<S> pumping the system causes the @xmath4  fs spectrum to be slightly different from the equilibrium situation at @xmath10 , with a depletion of intensity in the vb part and a small rise of intensity above the noise level in the cb region . </S>",
    "<S> this enhanced population of electrons around the cb edge and the corresponding holes around the vb edge are clearly seen in the difference between these edcs ( grey curve in fig . [ fig:3](a ) ) in a similar way as in the corresponding fig . [ fig:1](g ) . the same analysis for the 3.0  ev optical pumping regime </S>",
    "<S> is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis reveals that the intensity difference signal in the vb region is instead dominated by a small shift of the edc at @xmath4  fs to lower binding energies , compared to the edc taken before excitation . </S>",
    "<S> this yields a substantial increase ( decrease ) in the difference curve on the lower ( higher ) binding energy side of the vb peak , which is also visible in the entire mos@xmath0 vb in fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig:1](h ) . </S>",
    "<S> while the changes in the intensity difference seem dramatic , this shift is merely on the order of 10  mev as seen in the edcs in fig . [ fig:3](b ) . we can rule out that the shift is caused by a surface photovoltage effect or by a photoelectron space charge above the sample surface because only the the mos@xmath0 states shift . </S>",
    "<S> both aforementioned effects would have an impact on the photoelectron propagation in vacuum and thereby lead to shifts of both mos@xmath0 and au states @xcite .    [ t ! ]     </S>",
    "<S> recombine with holes ( orange circles ) in the au(111 ) bulk continuum ( orange shaded region ) by ultrafast auger processes ( black curled arrows ) . the same type of processes ( orange curled arrows ) are responsible for the recombination of holes in the vb of mos@xmath0 with electrons in au(111).,scaledwidth=38.0% ]    for the data taken with a 2.0  ev pump pulse , the shift appears insignificant in the intensity difference , and we can reliably assume that the time dependence of the intensity in the cb and vb regions originates entirely from the electron - hole pair dynamics induced by the pump pulse . </S>",
    "<S> this is studied in further detail in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:4](a)-[fig:4](b ) , showing the time - dependent integrated cb and vb intensity , respectively . in both cases </S>",
    "<S> we find the decay part to be well - described by a single exponential function with a time constant of 50  fs , which is at the limit of the time - resolution of our experiment . </S>",
    "<S> the free carrier dynamics observed here are several orders of magnitude faster than the dynamics reported for bulk gaas which is also a direct band gap semiconductor @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the 50  fs time - scale is too short for lattice excitations to take place . </S>",
    "<S> the observed ultrafast dynamics can therefore only be explained by auger - type electron - electron interactions directly involving the metal contact , as sketched in fig . [ fig:4](c ) . </S>",
    "<S> excited electrons in the cbm of sl mos@xmath0 can easily find a hole in the nearby bulk continuum of states in the metal while simultaneously exciting an electron - hole pair in the fermi sea of the metal . </S>",
    "<S> the reverse of these processes accounts for the hole dynamics in the vb .    </S>",
    "<S> finally we note that the free carrier dynamics we have observed here are also much faster than any other free carrier decay mechanisms - for example , exciton condensation , recombination in trap states originating from defects or radiative recombination . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that extremely efficient free carrier extraction is already present near gold electrodes in contact with the sl mos@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this type of material combination thus comprises a route towards exploiting the optically generated free carriers in novel 2d semiconductor systems . </S>",

    "<S> the sl epitaxial mos@xmath0 samples were grown by a physical vapor deposition ( pvd ) procedure consisting of mo evaporation on a clean single crystal au(111 ) substrate in an ultra - high vacuum ( uhv ) chamber with a low pressure of h@xmath0s gas , followed by annealing in the h@xmath0s atmosphere . </S>",

    "<S> high resolution equilibrium arpes data were obtained by transferring the sample through air to the sgm-3 uhv end - station of the synchrotron radiation source astrid2 in aarhus , denmark . </S>",

    "<S> the arpes data were collected with the sample temperature kept at 70  k. a photon energy of 25  ev was selected in order to be consistent with the tr - arpes data . </S>",

    "<S> a 1  khz ti : sapphire amplified laser system with a wavelength of 785  nm , a pulse duration of 30  fs and an energy per pulse of 12  mj was used to generate pump and probe pulses . in order to measure the band structure throughout the entire first bz of sl mos@xmath0 , </S>",
    "<S> probe pulses of @xmath14  ev , corresponding to the 15th harmonic of the laser fundamental , were generated by focusing a part of the laser energy on a pulsed jet of argon gas . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining laser energy was used to drive an optical parametric amplifier ( he - topas ) followed by a frequency mixing stage , which enabled us to obtain tunable pump pulses with wavelengths centered at 408  nm , 615  nm and 784  nm . </S>",
