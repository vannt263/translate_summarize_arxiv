    "there are many cases where one needs to deal with complex actions .",
    "one important example for high energy / nuclear physics is qcd at finite density ( see @xcite for a review on the recent developments ) .",
    "however , since a complex action does not give a real and positive boltzmann weight , one can not directly resort to the traditional markov chain monte carlo methods to estimate correlation functions .",
    "the so - called reweighting algorithm ( which absorbs the phase of the weight into observables ) is highly ineffective when the imaginary part of the action becomes very large ( such as in the thermodynamic limit ) , because one needs to take a sample from a configuration space where the weights of nearby configurations have almost the same amplitudes but very different phases .",
    "the difficulty of numerical evaluation in such a situation is termed the _ sign problem_.    there have been many proposals to circumvent the sign problem .",
    "one of the approaches that are currently under intense study is the use of the integration over lefschetz thimbles @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , which we will call the lefschetz thimble algorithm hereafter .",
    "there , the original real - valued variable ( say , @xmath2 ) is complexified according to the _ anti - holomorphic gradient flow _ ( sometimes called the _ upward flow _ in the literature ) @xmath3^\\ast$ ] . in the original lefschetz thimble algorithm ,",
    "as will be reviewed in subsec .",
    "[ subsec : lefschetz ] , the flow time is taken to infinity to map the original configuration space to a union of lefschetz thimbles .",
    "since the imaginary part of the action is constant on each thimble , the sign problem disappears if the path integral is made over the lefschetz thimbles .",
    "however , since two different thimbles are separated by an infinitely high potential barrier , one needs to invent a machinery to incorporate contributions from all relevant thimbles .",
    "recently , alexandru et al .",
    "@xcite made a very interesting proposal to consider configurations on a manifold that is obtained from the original configuration manifold by a finite amount of flow time .",
    "this algorithm made a great success in various models @xcite , but reducing the amount of flow time may also reduce the effectiveness against the sign problem , and one does not know _ a priori _ whether the chosen flow time avoids both the sign problem and the multi - modal problem simultaneously .    in this paper , as a versatile tool for monte carlo calculations of models with complex actions , we propose a lefschetz thimble algorithm where the flow time is used as an _ auxiliary variable _ for the highly multi - modal distribution .",
    "there can be various methods to realize this idea , and in this paper we implement the parallel tempering method because of its simplicity , by taking the flow time as a tempering parameter .",
    "there , we consider a set of manifolds corresponding to various flow times .",
    "two separated modes at large flow times ( where the sign problem no longer exists ) are then connected by passing through configurations at small flow times ( where the original sign problem exists but the multi - modality is expected to be mild ) . since the sample average is taken only with respect to the largest flow time , we need not worry about the sign problem at small flow times although we take into account configurations there .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : algorithm ] we first review the basics of the lefschetz thimble algorithm based on @xcite , and then implement the parallel tempering method in the algorithm by taking the flow time as a tempering parameter . in section [ sec : example ] we investigate the @xmath0-dimensional massive thirring model at finite density , and show that our algorithm correctly reproduces the analytic results for large flow times such as @xmath1 .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] is devoted to conclusion and outlook for future work .",
    "we consider a real @xmath4-dimensional dynamical variable , @xmath2 , with action @xmath5 which may take complex values for real - valued @xmath6 . our main concern is to evaluate the expectation values of functions of @xmath6 : @xmath7",
    "we assume that @xmath8 decreases rapidly enough in the limit @xmath9 , and that @xmath10 and @xmath11 are entire functions when regarded as functions of @xmath12 .",
    "the integration region can then be changed to any another region @xmath13 in @xmath14 as long as it is obtained as a continuous deformation of the original region with the boundary fixed at infinity .",

    "the key point is that the right - hand side of or does not depend on the flow time @xmath16 , so that one can set @xmath16 to an arbitrary value that is convenient for actual calculation .",
    "note that under the flow the real part @xmath25 does not decrease while the imaginary part @xmath26 is kept constant , because @xmath34 . in the original lefschetz thimble algorithm ,",
    "one takes the limit @xmath35 , in which @xmath19 approaches a union of connected components ( lefschetz thimbles ) , and the action has a constant imaginary part on each thimble . on each connected component @xmath36 , and @xmath36",
    "is obtained as the set of orbits flowing out of @xmath37 .",
    "the complementary submanifold to @xmath36 in @xmath14 consists of orbits which flow into @xmath37 , and will be denoted by @xmath38 .",
    "the integrations in are dominated by points near the intersection of @xmath39 and @xmath22 , ] in a generic situation the phase change coming from @xmath40 is sufficiently mild , so that the monte carlo calculation for the expression is free from sign problems .",
    "however , two different thimbles are also disconnected in the sense of monte carlo sampling because @xmath41 gets increased indefinitely near the boundary of each thimble .",
    "this multi - modality of distribution makes the monte carlo calculation impractical , especially when contributions from more than one thimble are relevant to estimating expectation values .",
    "a very interesting proposal made in @xcite is to use a finite amount @xmath16 which is chosen to be large enough to avoid the sign problem but also not too large in order to enable the exploration in the configuration space .",
    "however , one does not know _ a priori _ whether the adopted value of @xmath16 is actually free from the two obstacles ( the sign and multi - modal problems ) simultaneously",
    ". we will show that one can solve both simultaneously if we implement the parallel tempering method in their algorithm with the flow time as a tempering parameter .",
    "the basic idea of the parallel tempering algorithm @xcite is the following .",
    "suppose that we want to estimate expectation values with action @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is a dynamical variable and @xmath44 is the parameter ( such as the temperature ) we want to use for a monte carlo calculation .",
    "the point is that even when the distribution is multi - modal for the original @xmath44 ( e.g. , when @xmath44 represents a very low temperature ) , the multi - modality can be made mild if one takes another value @xmath45 ( e.g. , @xmath45 corresponding to a very high temperature ) .",
    "so , if the configuration space is enlarged such that the parameter can change gradually between @xmath44 and @xmath45 , two separated configurations for the original @xmath44 will be connected by passing through configurations at parameters near @xmath45 .",
    "the parallel tempering algorithm enables the move of configurations among different @xmath44 by enlarging the configuration space from @xmath46 to the set of @xmath47 replicas , @xmath48 .",
    "we there assign @xmath49 to replica @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) , such that @xmath52 and @xmath53 and that @xmath49 and @xmath54 are sufficiently close to each other .",
    "we set up an irreducible , aperiodic markov chain for the enlarged configuration space such that the probability distribution for @xmath55 eventually approach the equilibrium distribution proportional to @xmath56 we finally take sample averages only with respect to a sample taken from @xmath57 . the simplest algorithm to realize this idea is to swap two configurations of two adjacent replicas @xmath50 and @xmath58 , [ i.e.   to update the configuration @xmath59 to @xmath60 with the probability @xmath61 which obviously satisfies the detailed balance condition @xmath62    our proposal is to take the flow time @xmath16 as such tempering parameter .",
    "the basic algorithm is then as follows .",
    "fix the maximum flow time @xmath63 which should be sufficiently large such that the sign problem disappears there , and pick up flow times @xmath64 from the interval @xmath65 $ ] with @xmath66 .",
    "the values of @xmath67 and @xmath68 are determined manually or adaptively to optimize the acceptance rate in step 3 below . * .",
    "choose an initial value @xmath69 for each replica @xmath50 , and numerically solve the differential equations and to obtain the triplet @xmath70 . * .",
    "for each @xmath50 , construct a metropolis process to update the value of @xmath6 .",
    "explicitly , we take a value @xmath71 from @xmath72 using a symmetric proposal distribution , and recalculate the triplet @xmath73 using the @xmath71 as the initial value .",
    "we then update @xmath72 to @xmath71 with the probability @xmath74 , where @xmath75 [ recall that @xmath76 , eq .  ] .",
    "we repeat the process sufficiently many times such that local equilibrium is realized for each @xmath50 . * . starting from @xmath77 through @xmath78 , swap the values of @xmath6 between two adjacent replicas @xmath50 and @xmath58 with the probability @xmath79 * . after repeating steps 2 and 3 sufficiently many times ,",
    "get a triplet @xmath80 from @xmath57 as an element of a sample . * . after repeating steps 2 to 4 ,",
    "we obtain a sequence of triplets @xmath81 , which we use to estimate the expectation value : @xmath82 }    \\mathcal{o}\\bigl(z_{t}^{(a)}\\bigr )    }   { \\sum_a   e^{i \\bigl[{\\rm arg}\\det\\!j_{t}^{(a)}-s_i(z_{t}^{(a)})\\bigr ] }    } .",
    "\\label{eq : sum}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    note that the action with @xmath83 is the original action for which the sign problem exists .",
    "however , as can be seen from , the sample average is taken only with respect to the action with @xmath84 , so that we need not worry about the original sign problem although we include configurations near @xmath85 .",
    "also , @xmath84 can be taken to be sufficiently large such that the sign problem disappears if we complement intermediate flow times sufficiently ( with larger @xmath67 ) .",
    "thus , this simple algorithm solves the two obstacles simultaneously ; the original sign problem at @xmath83 is resolved at @xmath84 while the multi - modal problem at @xmath84 is resolved by passing through configurations near @xmath83 .",
    "does not cause a multi - modality in the configuration space .",

    "<S> the algorithm based on the integration over lefschetz thimbles is one of the promising methods to resolve the sign problem for complex actions . </S>",
    "<S> however , this algorithm often meets a difficulty in actual monte carlo calculations because the configuration space is not easily explored due to the infinitely high potential barriers between different thimbles . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we propose to use the flow time of the anti - holomorphic gradient flow as an auxiliary variable for the highly multi - modal distribution . </S>",
    "<S> to illustrate this , we implement the parallel tempering method by taking the flow time as a tempering parameter . in this algorithm </S>",
    "<S> , we can take the maximum flow time to be sufficiently large such that the sign problem disappears there , and two separated modes are connected through configurations at small flow times . to exemplify that this algorithm does work , we investigate the @xmath0-dimensional massive thirring model at finite density and show that our algorithm correctly reproduces the analytic results for large flow times such as @xmath1 .    </S>",
