    "most of the systems encountered in the nature are basically out of equilibrium .",
    "non - equilibrium systems have absorbed much interest recently .",
    "different methods have been used to study non - equilibrium systems , such as approximation methods , simulation , mean - field techniques , and analytical methods .",
    "most analytical studies on reaction diffusion systems , however , belong to one dimensional systems .",
    "the cayley tree is a lattice without loops , where each site is connected to @xmath0 neighbors , where @xmath0 is called the coordination number .",
    "the cayley tree with @xmath1 is in fact a one dimensional chain .",
    "cayley trees with @xmath2 are far richer than the one dimensional chains .",
    "the no - loop property of cayley tree results in the solvability of some models , for general coordination numbers .",
    "reaction diffusion models on the cayley tree have been studied in , for example , @xcite . in @xcite",
    "diffusion - limited aggregations , and in @xcite two - particle annihilation reactions for immobile reactants have been studied .",
    "there are also some exact results for deposition processes on the bethe lattice @xcite .    in @xcite the most general reaction - diffusion model on a cayley tree with nearest - neighbor interactions",
    "was introduced , which can be solved exactly through the empty - interval method .",
    "the stationary solutions as well as the dynamics of such models have been investigated there . in @xcite",
    ", it has been shown that there exist two exactly solvable models .",
    "for the first model , the probabilities of finding @xmath3 particles on the @xmath4-th shell of the cayley tree have been calculated . for the second model , some other probabilities have been calculated .",
    "recently , a nonconsensus opinion model model on bethe lattices has been studied .",
    "it is argued there that the phase diagram corresponding to such a model is different from that of regular percolation @xcite .",
    "a class of cooperative sequential adsorption models on a cayley tree with constant and variable attachment rates has been studied in @xcite .",
    "possible applications for ionic self - assembly of thin films and drug encapsulation of nanoparticles have been also studied .",
    "most of the studies on autonomous reaction - diffusion systems are on one - dimensional chains",
    ". some of the results could be easily generalized for multi - dimensional square lattices .",
    "a cayley tree , on the other hand , is an infinite - dimensional lattice , by which it is meant that the number of sites the distances of which with a fixed site are less than @xmath5 grows faster than any power of @xmath5 .    here",
    "a system is studied which consists of a cayley tree with sites being either occupied or empty .",
    "the evolution of the system is taken to consist of nearest neighbor interaction , with the further constraint that the system be autonomous , by which it is meant that the evolution of densities ( one - point functions ) is closed . the green s function for the initial value problem of the densities is calculated , and studied in more detail in some limiting cases .",
    "some special cases are also investigated more explicitly .",
    "especially , it is seen that the large - time behavior of the system is different for the coordination number equal to @xmath6 , and the coordination number larger than @xmath6 .",
    "the scheme of the paper is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "a system of interacting particles on a cayley tree is introduced .",
    "the reactions are nearest neighbor interaction , and the rates are such that the evolution equation of the average densities is closed . the stationary solutions of such models are discussed . in section 3 , a green s function approach is used to study the dynamics of the system . the green s function is calculated and used to obtain , among other things , the large time behavior of the system .",
    "some examples are worked out in more detail .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the concluding remarks .",
    "the cayley tree is a lattice without loops where each site is connected to @xmath0 neighboring sites .",
    "two sites are called neighbors if they are connected through a link , and @xmath0 is called the coordination number of the cayley tree .",
    "( 100,130)(0,-10 )   ( 40,50)part of a cayley tree with @xmath7     + assume a system of interacting particles on the cayley tree .",
    "each site is either empty or occupied by one particle",
    ". the time evolution of of each site depends on only that site and its nearest neighbors , those which directly related to it through a link .",
    "each site can be either occupied , denoted by @xmath8 , or vacant , denoted by @xmath9 .",
    "the number operator corresponding to the site @xmath10 is denoted by @xmath11 , which is @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) , if the site @xmath10 is vacant ( occupied ) .",
    "the evolution of such a system is governed by a hamiltonian @xmath14 .",
    "two neighboring sites with the joint state @xmath15 can evolve to another joint state @xmath16 with the rate @xmath17 .",
    "a system is called autonomous when the evolution of the average density , @xmath18 , is closed , by which it is meant that the evolution of @xmath18 is expressible in terms of only @xmath19 s .",
    "the criterion for autonomy has been obtained in @xcite .",
    "the argument is that corresponding to the site @xmath10 , the time derivative of @xmath20 is a summation of terms corresponding to the links which contain @xmath10 : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the set of sites the distance of them from the site @xmath10 is @xmath5 , and @xmath23 the condition for autonomy is that the coefficient of @xmath24 in the right - hand side vanishes .",
    "assuming that the interactions in each link are symmetric : @xmath25 one arrives at the following criterion for the autonomy : @xmath26    from now on , it is assumed that the interactions in each link are symmetric , and the autonomy criterion holds . defining @xmath27 the evolution for @xmath28 would be @xmath29 where @xmath0 is the number of neighbors to each site , and @xmath30 the requirement that the rates be nonnegative , and the criterion ( [ autonomy ] ) for the autonomy , lead to the following constraints @xmath31    equation ( [ evo ] ) which describes the evolution of the density , is clearly translational invariant .",
    "the initial condition , however , is not necessarily so .",
    "so in general the density does depend on the site . at large times",
    ", system approaches to its stationary state , which is a state with uniform density .",
    "the stationary solution to the above evolution is @xmath32 is @xmath33 defining the dynamic solution @xmath34 through @xmath35 one arrives at @xmath36    if the initial conditions are directionally - symmetric , by which it is meant that @xmath37 depends on only the distance of @xmath10 from some center , then the density remains directionally - symmetric .",
    "in such a situation , one defines another density @xmath38 through @xmath39 the evolution of this would be @xmath40 the case @xmath41 can be included in the general case , if one defines @xmath42 again , for the difference of @xmath43 and its stationary value , one has @xmath44 which can be written as @xmath45 where @xmath46",
    "to solve the initial value problem for the dynamic solution , one way is to use the green s function method . denoting the green s function by @xmath47 , one would have @xmath48 the initial value configuration for the green s function @xmath47 is directionally - symmetric ( with respect to the point @xmath49 ) .",
    "so the evolution of @xmath47 is governed by an equation similar to ( [ rsy ] ) . to be more specific , @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the distance of @xmath10 from @xmath49 , and",
    "@xmath52 satisfies @xmath53 the solution to the initial value problem for @xmath54 would then be @xmath55 of course @xmath52 can also be used to solve the directionally - symmetric initial value problem : @xmath56 comparing these , one arrives at @xmath57    to find the green s function @xmath52 , one could use the usual method of finding the eigenvectors of @xmath58 : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the eigenvector of @xmath58 corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath61 .",
    "an ansatz for @xmath60 is @xmath62 where @xmath63 s are the roots of the function @xmath64 with @xmath65 the function @xmath64 , has obviously two roots , and @xmath66 the analog of ( [ bo ] ) for @xmath60 , then results in @xmath67 there is another boundary condition , which is @xmath68 should not blow up at @xmath69 .",
    "this can be realized by introducing some @xmath70 and demanding @xmath71 be zero , and then sending @xmath70 to infinity .",
    "so the other boundary condition would be @xmath72 if @xmath73 , the above boundary condition would result in the vanishing of @xmath74 at @xmath75 ; and ( [ pro ] ) would mean that @xmath76 , so that ( [ fir ] ) would result in @xmath74 being zero too .",
    "so in order that @xmath60 be non vanishing , @xmath77 which , defining @xmath78 results in @xmath79 -\\sinh(\\eta-{\\mathrm{i}}\\theta)\\,\\exp[a\\,(-\\eta-{\\mathrm{i}}\\,\\theta)],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where ( [ fir ] ) has been used and a change of notation has been made from @xmath60 to @xmath80",
    ". it is seen that @xmath81 is nonnegative , and it is zero only for @xmath1 , which corresponds to a one - dimensional chain ( instead of the cayley tree ) .    to solve the initial value problem for @xmath82 ,",
    "one expands the @xmath83 in terms of the eigenvectors of @xmath58 .",
    "to do so , it is helpful to find the right eigenvectors of @xmath58 . denoting these by @xmath84",
    ", one has @xmath85 so @xmath86 , the right eigenvector of @xmath58 corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath87 , would satisfy @xmath88\\,\\phi_\\theta^0&=-\\gamma\\,\\xi\\,\\phi_\\theta^0+\\beta\\,\\phi_\\theta^1,\\nonumber\\\\ [ e(\\theta)]\\,\\phi_\\theta^1&=\\beta\\,\\xi\\,\\phi_\\theta^0-\\gamma\\,\\xi\\,\\phi_\\theta^1 + \\beta\\,\\phi_\\theta^2,\\nonumber\\\\ [ e(\\theta)]\\,\\phi_\\theta^b&=\\beta\\,(\\xi-1)\\,\\phi_\\theta^{b-1}-\\gamma\\,\\xi\\,\\phi_\\theta^b + \\beta\\,\\phi_\\theta^{b+1},\\qquad b>1.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the last equation suggests @xmath89 putting this in the remaining equations , one arrives at @xmath90 so , @xmath91 -\\sinh(\\eta+{\\mathrm{i}}\\theta)\\,\\exp[b\\,(\\eta+{\\mathrm{i}}\\,\\theta)]\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath92 is some normalization constant . using @xmath93 + \\pi\\,\\delta(\\chi),\\ ] ] one obtains @xmath94.\\ ] ] so the left eigenvectors are normalized through @xmath95 resulting in @xmath96\\ , \\left\\{\\frac{\\exp[b\\,(\\eta-{\\mathrm{i}}\\,\\theta)]}{\\sinh(\\eta+{\\mathrm{i}}\\theta)}- \\frac{\\exp[b\\,(\\eta+{\\mathrm{i}}\\,\\theta)]}{\\sinh(\\eta-{\\mathrm{i}}\\theta)}\\right\\},\\ ] ] with @xmath97 using these , the green s function for the evolution ( [ rrdy ] ) is seen to be @xmath98,\\nonumber\\\\ & = \\frac{1}{2\\,\\pi}\\,\\left[1-\\frac{\\exp(-\\eta)}{2\\,\\cosh\\eta}\\,\\delta_0^b\\right]\\ , \\exp\\{(b - a)\\,\\eta-[2\\,\\gamma\\,\\cosh\\eta\\,\\exp(\\eta)]\\,t\\}\\nonumber\\\\ & \\quad\\times\\int_{-\\pi}^\\pi{\\mathrm{d}}\\theta\\,\\left\\{\\exp[{\\mathrm{i}}\\,(a - b)\\,\\theta]+ \\frac{\\sinh({\\mathrm{i}}\\,\\theta+\\eta)}{\\sinh({\\mathrm{i}}\\,\\theta-\\eta)}\\,\\exp[{\\mathrm{i}}\\,(a+b)\\,\\theta]\\right\\}\\nonumber\\\\ & \\quad\\times\\exp\\{[2\\,\\beta\\,\\cos\\theta\\,\\exp(\\eta)]\\,t\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    among other things , one can investigate some special or limiting cases .",
    "it is seen that at large times the integral is dominated by the integrand around @xmath99 . defining @xmath100 + \\frac{\\sinh({\\mathrm{i}}\\,\\theta+\\eta)}{\\sinh({\\mathrm{i}}\\,\\theta-\\eta)}\\,\\exp[{\\mathrm{i}}\\,(a+b)\\,\\theta],\\ ] ]",
    "it is seen that the behavior of @xmath101 for small @xmath102 is different for @xmath81 being zero or positive .",
    "in fact only the even part of @xmath101 contributes to the integral , and that part behaves ( for small @xmath102 ) as @xmath103 so at large times , @xmath104,&\\qquad&\\eta=0.\\\\ g_a{}^b(t)&=\\frac{(a+\\coth\\eta)\\,(b+\\coth\\eta)}{2\\,\\sqrt{\\pi\\,[\\beta\\,\\exp(\\eta)\\,t]^3}}\\ , \\left[1-\\frac{\\exp(-\\eta)}{2\\,\\cosh\\eta}\\,\\delta_0^b\\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & \\quad\\times\\exp\\{(b - a)\\,\\eta+[2\\,(\\beta-\\gamma\\,\\cosh\\eta)\\,\\exp(\\eta)]\\,t\\},&\\qquad&\\eta>0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is seen that the large time behavior of the system for @xmath105 ( equivalent to @xmath1 , when the cayley tree is a one dimensional chain ) is different from that of @xmath106 ( corresponding to @xmath107 ) . even the large time behavior for @xmath108 is different from the large time behavior for @xmath105 .",
    "the reason is that in approximating @xmath109 for small values of @xmath102 , the result is different for @xmath108 and @xmath105 , due to the fraction in the second term . for @xmath105 ,",
    "that fraction is equal to @xmath13 , no matter how small @xmath102 is .",
    "but if @xmath106 , no matter how small it is , there are values for @xmath102 which are much smaller than @xmath81 , which make the fraction equal to @xmath110 .",
    "one can , however , find a cross - over time when such a shift in behavior occurs .",
    "this comes from the fact that for large values of @xmath111 , the relevant values of @xmath102 are those which are less than a ceratin value @xmath112 : @xmath113 if @xmath112 is much smaller than @xmath81 , then the behavior corresponds to the case of @xmath106 .",
    "so the cross - over time @xmath114 satisfies @xmath115 if @xmath111 is large but still much smaller than @xmath114 , then the behavior is similar to the case of @xmath105 .",
    "the one dimensional chain is a cayley tree with @xmath1 ( equivalently @xmath105 ) . in that case , the integration in the expression for the green s function is readily performed and one obtains @xmath116,\\qquad\\xi=2,\\ ] ] where @xmath117 is the modified bessel function of the first kind of order @xmath118 .",
    "+      the green s function is simplified in the opposite limit ( large @xmath0 ) as well . for large values of @xmath0 ( or @xmath81 ) ,",
    "the integral in the expression of the green s function is again dominated by the value of the integrand for small @xmath102 .",
    "hence a techinque similar to what was used for the large time behavior can be used here .",

    "one arrives at @xmath121 so , @xmath122\\,t\\ } \\nonumber\\\\ & \\quad\\times\\bigg(-\\frac{\\exp(-\\eta)}{2\\,\\cosh\\eta}\\,\\int_{-\\pi}^\\pi{\\mathrm{d}}\\theta\\,\\exp({\\mathrm{i}}\\,a\\,\\theta)\\ , \\bigg[1+\\frac{\\sinh({\\mathrm{i}}\\,\\theta+\\eta)}{\\sinh({\\mathrm{i}}\\,\\theta-\\eta)}\\bigg]\\nonumber\\\\ & \\quad+\\int_{-\\pi}^\\pi{\\mathrm{d}}\\theta\\,\\bigg\\ { \\frac{\\exp[(r+1)\\,(\\eta-{\\mathrm{i}}\\,\\theta)]-1}{\\exp(\\eta-{\\mathrm{i}}\\,\\theta)-1}\\nonumber\\\\ & \\quad+ \\frac{\\exp[(r+1)\\,(\\eta+{\\mathrm{i}}\\,\\theta)]-1}{\\exp(\\eta+{\\mathrm{i}}\\,\\theta)-1}\\ , \\frac{\\sinh({\\mathrm{i}}\\,\\theta+\\eta)}{\\sinh({\\mathrm{i}}\\,\\theta-\\eta)}\\bigg\\}\\,\\exp({\\mathrm{i}}\\,a\\,\\theta)\\bigg)\\nonumber\\\\ & \\quad\\times\\exp\\{[2\\,\\beta\\,\\cos\\theta\\,\\exp(\\eta)]\\,t\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where ( [ gre ] ) has been used .",
    "a system of particles was studied which move and react on a cayley tree , so that the interactions are nearest - neighbor , and autonomous .",
