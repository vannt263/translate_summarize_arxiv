    "the combination of chiral lagrangian with nonperturbative unitary techniques in coupled channels of mesons and baryons has become a powerful method to study the meson - meson and meson - baryon interactions and new states in the resonance region , which are not easily explained using the conventional constituent quark model .",
    "the analysis of the meson baryon scattering matrices shows poles in the second riemann sheet that can be associated to known resonances or new ones . in this way , @xmath12 resonances have been generated dynamically in the interaction of pseudoscalar mesons with octet baryons , which fit quite well the spectrum of the known low - lying resonances with these quantum numbers@xcite .",
    "similarly , the @xmath13 resonances are obtained in the interaction of pseudoscalar mesons with decuplet baryons@xcite .",
    "the theory on the hidden gauge symmetry supplies a mechanism to include vector mesons in the chiral lagrangian@xcite .",
    "therefore , the study on the interaction between vector mesons and other hadrons becomes possible . along this clue ,",
    "the interactions between vector mesons and psuedoscalar mesons are studied and the radiative decays of some axial - vector mesons generated dynamically are discussed@xcite .",
    "similarly , the scattering amplitudes of two @xmath14 mesons are calculated within the framework of coupled - channel lippman - schwinger equations , and two resonances @xmath15 and @xmath16 are generated dynamically@xcite .",
    "this work has been extended to the @xmath17-space of vector mesons in ref .",
    "@xcite , where several known resonances are also dynamically generated . in the baryon sector , the interaction of vector mesons and decuplet baryons is addressed in refs .",

    "this method is also extended to study the interaction of vector mesons and octet baryons , and several baryon resonances have been found as a result of solving the coupled - channel lippman - schwinger equations@xcite .",
    "however , the resonances generated dynamically are spin degenerate since the amplitude obtained from @xmath0 channel interaction is independent of spin .",
    "because the masses of vector mesons are comparable to those of baryons , only @xmath0 channel diagrams might be incomplete to obtain a reliable interaction of vector mesons and baryons .",

    "@xcite , the @xmath0,@xmath1 , @xmath2 channel diagrams and a contact diagram originating from the tensor term of the vector meson - octet baryon interaction are all taken into account , and four spin - determined resonances are found in a non - relativistic approximation of the coupled - channel lippman - schwinger equations . in the present work ,",
    "we deduce the interaction kernel of vector mesons and octet baryons including a vector meson exchange in @xmath0 channel , octet baryon exchange in @xmath1 , @xmath2 channels , and a contact diagram related only to the tensor interaction term in a fully relativistic framework , and then calculate the scattering amplitudes of vector mesons and octet baryons by solving the coupled - channel lippman - schwinger equations .",
    "the amplitude of the vector mesons and octet baryons will be expanded in terms of partial waves , and then the poles of the amplitudes in different partial waves are detected in the complex energy plane in center of mass system , which can be associated to some well - known resonances .    in sect .",
