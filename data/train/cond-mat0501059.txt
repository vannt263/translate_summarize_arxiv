    "the study of the consumption of cultural goods in general , and that of films in particular , has been traditionally restricted to total demand empirical studies .",
    "most of these studies have followed the original guidelines set by the earliest authors , such as baumol & bowen @xcite or moore @xcite . in these studies variations in quality of the good have been consigned to a residual status , focusing in the effect of prices and income as the main explanatory factors .",
    "other studies , such as the one performed by blanco & baos - pino @xcite , have considered the availability of alternative leisure activities ; while on the other side , models such as the one presented by thorsby @xcite have considered the impact of quality on final attendance , incorporating it either as an expected value at the individual level or as a macro variable obtained ex - post from critic s review indexes @xcite or from online reviews @xcite .",
    "although we acknowledge their efforts , we must say that in the latter works the authors were not concerned with the structure of the consumption cycle as an indicator of film quality .",
    "their work is close to ours , only in the sense that reviews act as a form of social interaction , which turns out to be a key ingredient of our model .",
    "however useful , demand studies as the ones surveyed above do not account for the dynamics of the consumption life cycle of the cultural good and , more importantly , they do not discuss the ways in which the structure of this cycle is affected by the transmission of information from members who have had access to the cultural good to potential consumers .    beside economic analysis",
    ", the sociologist lipovetsky @xcite has focused his work on the macro structure of the life cycle , mainly in terms of its duration .",
    "basic principles which underlie this process , however , are not identified in his work . in this paper",
    "we propose a model based on first principles , which agrees with all the observed behaviors exhibited by the empirical data of the movie industry .",
    "the model is concerned with the primary life cycle of the good , but it differs from the others in the sense that the whole structure of the life cycle is recovered , not only the characteristic decay times or the total consumption are considered like in previous studies .",
    "although the consumption life cycle of some cultural goods can be potentially unbounded ( we still buy copies from don quixote ) , the aim of this work is to understand the dynamics of the primary life cycle , which finishes when per period consumption decreases below a certain threshold relative to its premiere level .",
    "a less ambiguous case is that of performing arts like theater , where producers are forced to cancel presentations when box - office revenues goes below fixed costs . the alternative cost associated with the availability of new options , effect which also applies to the film industry or best - sellers book industry , strengthens the limited duration life cycle that characterizes aggregated consumption in these environments .",
    "we present a model that reproduces the life cycle dynamics and is determined by three basic factors :    * \\(i ) the size of the targeted group * \\(ii ) the prior conception about the quality of the good in question ; and * \\(iii ) the effect of social interactions , in the form of information about the quality of the good , between agents who have effectively experienced the good and potential consumers",
    ".    it will be the latter effect the one which determines the particular shape of the consumption life cycle .    in relation with the literature studying the diffusion of technological innovations",
    ", our model relates to the works of mansfield @xcite , and bass @xcite , with the difference that the dynamical process that underlies the shape of the cycle are identified and made accountable for it . whereas bass uses a parameterized curve that he fits into the empirical behavior , without incorporating any dynamical justifications for the curves he chooses .",
    "word of mouth can be justified as a valid mechanism of social influence by following works like the one presented by moore @xcite .",
    "he argues that given the scale economy that characterizes certain technologies , e.g. , database software , it is impractical ( or too expensive ) to do small - scale experiments and , thus , word - of - mouth becomes an important part of the diffusion process of these investment goods .",
    "going to the movies , however , poses a somewhat different problem for potential consumers .",
    "first , `` early adopters '' do not face the risks normally associated with the adoption of a novel technology and thus an important fraction of them will be willing to consume the good before peer s opinions become available .",
    "this will be performed based solely on the pre - opening expectations generated by the media and the producers themselves .",
    "this leads the life - cycle consumption process to diverge from the standard s - shaped behavior associated with the adoption of a novel technology .",
    "on the other hand , new movies which become available for the general public tend to have an initial attendance which is relatively high and usually decrease all along the consumption cycle , the sole exception being small productions or independent films which show a consumption life - cycle that resembles that of novel technology adoption .",
    "our model captures both forms of behavior .    other family of models , which takes into account social interaction effects in the dynamics of consumption , is that of `` fashion cycles '' @xcite . in our case , however , the demand of a good does not decrease due to the consumption of it by other agents , the movie does not become worn out , like a fashion design , in fact what the model attempts to capture is the fact that agents who have seen the movie have an impact on the expected value of the good of agents who have not seen it .    a different approach for the diffusion of innovations is to consider site percolation on regular lattices @xcite .",
    "these models are based on the assumption that agents occupy the vertex of a regular lattice in @xmath5 dimensions and are represented by a random number .",
    "innovations diffuse by percolating the lattice according to a certain quality value which when above the percolation threshold generates a giant consumption cluster .",
    "although we acknowledge this efforts we believe that spatially realistic models should consider a network substrate instead of a regular lattice .",
    "social networks exhibit topological properties which are completely different to the substrate defined by a regular lattice , such as the scaling properties of its degree distribution @xcite , the community structure @xcite and the short average path length @xcite to name a few . in this paper",
    "we present a model that does not take this substrate into account , it could be consider a mean field solution or jelly model , regardless of this we are able to reproduce all the types of aggregated behavior .",
    "we now present a model of cultural consumption based on the following assumptions .    *",
    "\\(i ) each agent goes to see a movie at the theater only once .",
    "( we neglect the probability of going twice assuming that the probability of going to the theater to see the same movie @xmath6 times is a rapidly decaying function of @xmath6 ) . *",
    "\\(ii ) the probability that an agent goes to the movies is affected by the interactions with agents who have already seen it .",
    "the different quantities associated with the model will be expressed using the following notation .",
    "@xmath7 will represent the number of agents that have not watched the movie at discrete time @xmath8 , while @xmath9 will represent the probability that an agent who has not watched the movie decides to attend it at discrete time @xmath8 .",
    "the observable quantity that can be measured is the number of agents who have seen the movie at discrete time @xmath8 .",
    "we will call this quantity @xmath10 . in our model , it will be given by the product @xmath11 , which is nothing more than the expected number of agents attending the good .    before the movie is available for its potential consumers , agents have a prior conception about its quality , which comes from the information of pre - observable features such as its budget , the cast , and advertisement .",
    "the availability of this information will depend on the marketing strategies of the producers and distributors .",
    "irrespectively of the way in which these strategies are conceptualized , i.e. , whether publicity is taken as an information provider or as a persuasive device , its effects on our model are equivalent , affecting the prior conception about the movie in question and , therefore , the agents likelihood of actually purchasing it at the beginning of the process .",
    "we will denote this likelihood by @xmath12 , and we will call the initial target population @xmath13 ; which represents the total number of potential attendants of the good before it becomes available .    it can be argued that the length of the consumption cycle that the paper takes into consideration is unrealistically short , since the energy of film producers is directed to finding , successfully , new ways of lengthening it .",
    "sedgwick @xcite claims that more than 70 per cent of film revenue is derived from non - theatrical resources .",
    "however , given the dramatic effect that the primary cycle of consumption has in the subsequent ones , we believe that this primary cycle is worth of investigation on its own .",
    "the simplest case is the one of an atomized society where agents decisions are independent from each other , both in terms of information the opinion of agents who have watched the movie do not influence the decision of potential consumers and in terms of consumption there are no network externalities associated with timely coordinated consumption in this case , we will also assume that restrictions on the supply side do not apply .",
    "the whole targeted population could simultaneously go to the theater and the horizon of its exhibition has no time limit .    in this case",
    "the probability of attending the theater does not depend on time , and it is equal to its initial value @xmath12 .",
    "the system dynamics can be described by considering that the expected attendance at a given time is given by the product between @xmath12 and @xmath7 ; and that at the beginning of the process no agents have seen the movie .",
    "after the first time step some agents will have attended the theater , and we will therefore have to subtract them from the ones who have not .",
    "thus the temporal variation of will be given by @xmath14    if we approximate the discrete variables by continuous ones and notice that in the first time step attendance is given by , we can conclude that the general solution of equation ( 1 ) has the traditional form @xmath15    @xmath16    in the next section we will see how social interactions alter this behavior .",
    "once the effect of social interactions are considered , @xmath9 becomes a dynamical variable and its change in time is then due to two main contributions .",
    "the first one is the one associated with the transmission of information about the observed value of the movie , and it represents the change in the probability of attending the theater induced by the information about it transmitted between agents . after the first period of attendance , residual potential consumers have access to the opinion of the first period audience .",
    "this effect is cumulative as the residual consumers have potential access to the opinions of audiences from the previous time steps order where opinions are transmitted to residual consumers also via agents who have not yet participated in the consumption of the cultural good .",
    "qualitative properties of an @xmath6 order process in which the effect s strength diminishes over time , would be equivalent to the @xmath17 order process investigated here .",
    "wu et al.@xcite have shown that information flow remains bounded as long as the likelihood of transmitting information remains sufficiently small ] .",
    "we assume that the change induced in @xmath9 by this effect will be proportional to the probability that agents who have not seen the movie meet with agents who have .",
    "the proportionality constant associated with this term will be the one representing the strength of it .",
    "the second contribution we considered is the one associated with coordinated consumption . in the case of performing arts , agents usually attend in groups ; therefore agents who have not seen the movie are less likely to go if they are not able to find other agents to keep them company .",
    "the change induced by this effect will always reduce attendance likelihood , and it is also proportional to the probability that agents who have attended the good meet with ones who have not .",
    "therefore , when we consider the effect of social interactions , we can write the change in the probability of attending the good as    @xmath18    where @xmath19 represents the proportionality constant associated with the effects of information flow while @xmath20 is the one associated with the social coordination effects . from now on we will focus on the case in which @xmath19 can take positive and negative values representing the fact that information transmitted between agents can stimulate or inhibit the future attendance of other agents . whereas @xmath20 will always contribute negatively .",
    "this is because coordinated consumption can only reduce the likelihood of going to the theater for un - coordinated agents .",
    "both terms , it is worth noticing , act directly on the population , altering the likelihood that agents will attend or purchase the good .",
    "although agents are not explicit rational optimizers who make their decision over the basis of a bayesian update of their beliefs about the movie s quality , one could understand this model as the outcome of rational searching behavior in an incomplete information environment .",
    "the continuous version of the system can be solved analytically in the case in which @xmath19,@xmath20 do not depend on time and the effects are not cumulative . in this case ( 1 ) and ( 4 ) reduce to @xmath21 @xmath22 which in the continuous case can be represented by @xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25    to find a solution we notice that equation ( 7 ) can be substituted into equation ( 8) giving us a third differential equation relating @xmath26 and @xmath27 which can be solved and used to introduce the initial conditions of the system .",
    "this relation can be expressed as @xmath28    replacing [ 9 ] back on equation ( 7 ) and integrating it , we find that the solution of the system is given by @xmath29 @xmath30 where the constant @xmath31 is defined as @xmath32     ( a ) fraction of agents attending the theater a a function of time according to the model described by eqns .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) and ( [ 8 ] )",
    ". the segmented line represents the atomized behavior described by eqn .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) while the lines on top of it and below of it represent the behavior of positive and negative @xmath33 values respectively .",
    "( b ) shows the accumulated attendance , or in other words , the integral in time of ( a).,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    figure [ fig1 ] shows the attendance as a function of time as well as the accumulated attendance normalized by the total target population ( @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) .",
    "the segmented line represents the atomized behavior occurring when @xmath9 remains constant throughout the process , it also divides the behavior of the system in two , the solutions that lie above it are examples of cases in which @xmath33 is a positive quantity , these are examples of systems which are dominated by a strongly favorable flow of information stimulating the consumption of the good . on the contrary ,",
    "the lines that lie below the dashed one are the ones for which @xmath33 is a negative quantity and are dominated by coordination effects .",
    "summarizing , we can see that two classes of behavior are predicted .",
    "the first class is characterized by a monotonic decay with an exponential tail .",
    "whereas , when the strength of social interactions @xmath33 is large enough , a second class of behavior emerges . in this case a period of increasing attendance exists until a maximum is reached . after this , the first class of behavior develops .",
    "the latter case has an accumulated behavior that resembles the standard ogive s - shape , which characterizes technological diffusion .",
    "the model represented by equations ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) was validated by comparing it with the u.s .",
    "box - office data available on the internet movie database ( imdb ) web site .",
    "we considered the 44 movies with the highest budgets of 2003 as our sample set and performed a @xmath36 estimation procedure on all movies in order to find the parameter set which most accurately fitted the empirical results .",
    "the model has 3 free parameters , the two initial conditions @xmath13 and @xmath37 , and the constant representing the strength of social interactions @xmath33 .",
    "the parameters used in the @xmath36 minimization process were @xmath33 and @xmath38 while @xmath12 was determined by matching the first data point on the data set with the first data point in the model-@xmath39- .",
    "this reduced the number of free parameters to just two .",
    "the data set considered did not contain weekly attendance as a function of time but the weekly gross collected by the movie .",
    "we consider that the amount of money collected in the box office by a movie is a linear function of the number of people that attended it .",
    "this allow us to do our empirical analysis based on the weekly amount of money collected by a particular movie , which is equivalent to making the analysis based on the number of agents attending it .",
    "three examples of the fitting procedure are shown for ( a ) lord of the rings i ( b ) blade ii ( c ) kissing jessica stein.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    figure ( [ fig2 ] ) shows three plots comparing the model with the empirical data . both , the lord of the rings : fellowship of the ring , and blade ii represent two examples of the first class of behavior identified in the previous section .",
    "it is worth noticing that the slope followed by the data changes in time .",
    "the first points have a negative slope , which is considerably more pronounced than the ones in the tail .",
    "a simple exponential fit will be accurate in only one section of the curve , but would fail to fit both behaviors that were expected from the model and that appear to be present in nature    in order to interpret the relative values of @xmath33 , and therefore compare different motion pictures , it is important to consider the behavioral class in which the particular films are located .",
    "blockbuster movies have a high initial attendance , which causes population finite size and social coordination effects to be very strong .",
    "this tell us that movies in this category will usually have a negative value for @xmath33 , and the magnitude of it will represent the observed value of the good .",
    "small negative values are associated with movies in which the decay is not accelerated due to the observed quality , but exhibit some acceleration due to social coordination effects . on the other hand ,",
    "large negative values map into accelerated decays that we believe are due to social coordination effects plus poor values in the observed quality of the good .    in the second class of behavior ,",
    "the premier level of attendance is low , thus coordination effects do not act strongly on the system , because of the initially slow depleting of potential customers . in this case ,",
    "small values of @xmath33 represent a movie in which agents attended in a random fashion and the decay is not accelerated or damped due to social effects . on the other hand when relatively large values of @xmath33 are observed the attendance increases during the first time steps .",
    "this increase in consumption is due to the fact that the movie was well evaluated and that the pool of possible attendants was not depleted during the first couple of weeks .    summarizing , in order to interpret the parameter associated with the observed quality of the good @xmath33 , it is important to consider two things .",
    "first we consider the class of behavior to which the movie actually pertains , this can be done by observing if the premiere attendance represents a large fraction of the total one .",
    "then , once the movie has been associated with a certain class of behavior , the actual value of sigma should be interpreted relative to the distribution of values associated with movies in that particular class    from the empirical point of view and after observing the whole data set it becomes apparent that the values of sigma that we found tend to lie in a well defined distribution . figure ( [ fig4 ] )",
    "shows the distribution of values for @xmath33 obtained using this data set and the procedure explained above .",
    "given the selection criterion used , movies with the highest budgets , it is natural to see that this curve shows @xmath33 values belonging to the blockbuster class of behavior .",
    "a negative bias is observed when we look at the distribution of @xmath33 presented in figure ( [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "this negative bias tells us that in most cases , the coordination effect , which could also be associated with the underlying effect of cultural competition , dominates the dynamical properties of the system .     for the 44 studied movies .",
    "[ fig4],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    on the basis of the conjecture that coordinated consumption has the same effect on all motion pictures inside the same behavioral class , we can interpret that the value extracted for @xmath33 represents the actual effect that the flow of the information associated with the observed value has on the film , and therefore on its consumption life cycle .",
    "this would indicate that coordinated consumption only introduces a shift in the value of @xmath33 and that the deviation from this well - defined mean represents the actual value of the movie as given by the targeted audience .",
    "for instance , the differences in the estimated parameter for the lord of the rings and blade ii , would indicate that the former film was much better received than the latter one . *",
    "what is interesting about this result is that we do not claim an actual value based on the opinion of a film critic or an audience survey , we infer it from the structure of attendance behavior we observe*. this reversed engineering , definition of the observed value of subjective _ film quality _ presented here can be used to characterize consumers response to specific genres and thus help target film publicity and distribution in a more effective way .",
    "a dynamical model representing the life cycle of motion pictures was introduced .",
    "the assumptions of the model were that    * \\i ) agents do not go to the theater to see a particular movie more than once , and that * \\ii ) the probability that agents go to the theater changes in a way which is proportional to the number of agents who have attended the theater times the ones who have not .",
    "the first of these assumptions is the one that gives rise to the exponential decay that characterize the tail of this process , while the second one is the one that allows the system to adjust its decay according to the social interactions present in cultural consumption , and consequently allows the model to accurately fit the different classes of observed behavior , namely ,    * \\i ) a monotonic decay with an exponential tail , and * \\ii ) an exponential adoption followed by an exponential tail which is traduced into an ogive s - shaped behavior when the accumulated theater attendance is observed .",
    "in addition , under certain assumptions , our model can be used to infer a quantitative estimator of the subjective reception of a particular film .",
    "an estimate which is independent of critics review and is inferred only from the shape of the consumption life cycle .",
    "further research in this area can be directed in a variety of ways .",
    "a natural extension of the model analyzed here would be to consider the more general setting in which the agents face a number of cultural options and a limited budget for a given period of time .",
    "it is also an area interest to investigate the link between the primary life of consumption and subsequent phases of consumption .",
    "another route for more empirically oriented research could be associated with the investigation of longitudinal processes in order to explore how the structure of the consumption life cycle has evolved along the last decades , and transversal processes to see the differences and correlations between the reception of particular films in different geographical regions .",
    "a more complete analysis of the movie industry database should be carried out in order to understand the nature of these structures .",
    "we thank the comments of samuel bowles , peter richerson , marcos singer and the participants of the workshop on evolution and the social sciences at the ceu , budapest .",
