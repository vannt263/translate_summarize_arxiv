    "that the action of gravity on light can be interpreted as a variable vacuum refractive index has been a persistent theme in the literature - @xcite - and in some of the standard texts on gr - .",
    "the condition that gravitational action on light be _ exactly _ expressible in terms of a variable scalar refractive index @xmath1 is just that the metric can be put into isotropic form , whereupon @xmath2 is the coordinate speed of light ( the proper speed of light is always @xmath3 ) .",
    "since this condition is met outside the event horizon of the schwarzschild solution , and by all the flrw metrics , the refractive index interpretation and corresponding mathematics of em propagation in gravitational fields has wide application . in the event that the coordinate system can not be put into isotropic form , have given the general relationship between the metric tensor and the generalized constitutive relations to be ascribed to the vacuum that will correctly predict the behaviour of the em fields .",
    "these relations include the requirement , in order that em radiation suffer no bi - refringence , that the electric permittivity and magnetic susceptibility are mutually proportional . in summary , these works are based upon the premise that , ignoring the action upon matter but otherwise without loss of physical accuracy , the gravitational action on em fields in a given metric can be interpreted as due to gravitationally - modulated _ vacuum polarizability_.    @xcite was probably the first to suggest extension of the ( specifically ) refractive index paradigm to include matter , by which means he demonstrated agreement with theory to the level of the newtonian approximation .",
    "subsequently , @xcite gave the dependence required of the rest mass on the local vacuum refractive index in order that matter precisely follow the geodesics of the schwarzschild solution .",
    "interpreted literally , though the details are omitted , the efforts of wilson and atkinson amount to the presumption of an electromagnetic basis for mechanical mass .",
    "supposing this claim can be substantiated , such an approach , however , does not constitute an electromagnetic theory of gravity for as long as the einstein action has no electromagnetic explanation .",
    "@xcite have given suggestions for how the latter might emerge from an _ effective _ action wherein the observable degrees of freedom are really linearized fluctuations of an invisible _ background _ field .",
    "in addition to the authors cited above , @xcite , also , was an advocate of the refractive index interpretation of the action of gravity on light . like wilson and atkinson ,",
    "dicke went on to speculate on an electromagnetic basis for mechanical mass , whereby the polarizable vacuum paradigm could be extended to encompass not only em but also matter .",
    "his work has recently been re - visited by @xcite .",
    "unlike all previously cited authors apart from puthoff , however , it is evident in those papers that dicke s motivation was to demonstrate the viability of a theory that is electromagnetically motivated from the outset , rather than simply to forge agreement between gr and a theory of a polarizable vacuum ( hereafter , ` pv ' ) . an important consequence of that difference is that dicke adduces a metric that differs from that of schwarzschild in the higher order terms of the ppn expansion .",
    "specifically , if the components of the line element for the latter are written in isotropic coordinates as @xmath4 where @xmath5 , then the corresponding pv line element , @xcite , is @xmath6 ( here and throughout , rather than set to 1 through redefinition of the time coordinate , the speed of light @xmath3 is retained in respect of the interpretation of @xmath7 as modifying the vacuum speed in a euclidean background . )",
    "consistent with this line element , the pv metric always has the form @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the vacuum polarizability .",
    "the specification of pv is complete by assigning to the @xmath7-field , on the basis of maximum mathematical simplicity consistent with local lorentz invariance , the action of a scalar wave equation with speed @xmath10 .",
    "it is important that though dicke s reasoning lead him to equations ) and ( [ pvlineelement ] ) , it did not do so unambiguously ; his choice rested ultimately on the criterion of mathematical simplicity , given that gravitational action is fundamentally electromagnetic and mediated by a polarizable vacuum .",
    "this is best demonstrated by contrasting the very simple expressions obtained by pv for the refractive index and mass - dependency on the gravitational field strength parameter @xmath11 , for example , with the results of @xcite . in the latter ,",
    "it is recalled , gr effects on em and matter are driven by the requirement that the ( gr ) schwarzschild metric be reproduced exactly .",
    "atkinson s work achieves the stated aim , but at the price of cumbersome expressions relating the refractive index and rest - mass to @xmath11 , making the correspondence look like a force - fit @xcite . in particular , eliminating @xmath11 , it can be shown that in the case of the schwarzschild metric the rest - mass is a sixth - order polynomial in the refractive index , and can not , therefore , be given in closed form .",
    "@xcite , whose aim was to establish the formal correspondence for the em fields alone , concludes likewise .",
    "specifically he writes that `` the medium equivalent approach does not look any simpler than general relativity ; on the contrary it may be mathematically more cumbersome and less elegant '' .",
    "by contrast , in pv the refractive index and mass - dependencies are both exponentials of @xmath11 , and therefore are related by a simple power .    as noted by @xcite , the yilmaz theory of gravity @xcite has in common with pv a line element of the form ( [ pvlineelement ] ) in the particular case that @xmath12 is the only non - zero element of the stress energy tensor , i.e. where the source matter is static , and the pressure / stress and momentum terms are zero @xcite .",
    "given that yilmaz originally conceived of his theory in terms of a polarizable vacuum , @xcite , this shared characteristic lends some support to the ` electromagnetic interpretation ' of the pv metric .",
    "further connections between the two theories are discussed in section [ sec : developments ] .",
    "though based upon a single scalar function , this remarkably simply theory passes the four standard tests of gr . yet , to the extent that pv is driven fundamentally by an em paradigm , it is a representative of a genre that is quite different from gr .",
    "however , apart from the recent report by puthoff , it appears not to have been otherwise pursued since dicke s original publication .",
    "the aim of this document is to fill the gap and thereby permit a more informed assessment of the viability of pv and its domain of applicability . in the following then , the theory is applied to a few cosmological and astrophysical problems , and its predictions compared with the data .",

    "evidently this action is not invariant under arbitrary coordinate transformations , and therefore , unlike gr , the background coordinates here contain some physical significance .    several obvious changes and generalisations of equation ( [ 2 ] )",
    "are required to render pv compatible with the cosmological principle :    1 .",
    "long - range em forces are negligible compared to gravitational forces , whereupon the em interaction part of the action due to any charge can be safely ignored .",

    "the two equations can be united in the form @xmath44 where in gr @xmath45 , and in pv @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath39 has been defined so that when @xmath47 in gr , a positive value gives rise to collapse , i.e. it has the sign of ` @xmath48 ' in the traditional notation . in pv",
    "a positive @xmath49 connotes a positive net overall energy . in both cases - gr and pv -",
    "the magnitude and sign of both @xmath49 and @xmath50 can be decided , for example , by regression of the data for @xmath51 versus @xmath41 onto the corresponding friedmann equation ( i.e. equation ( [ 13 ] ) for either @xmath52 ) .",
    "both the mass energy density and the electromagnetic energy density could , in principle , be determined locally , without reference to either the friedmann equation or the theoretical framework in which it is to be employed ( gr or pv ) . in any case",
    ", the sign of both will be positive .",
    "carrying out the usual normalisation using the present value of the hubble constant @xmath53 ( the scale factor at the present time is 1 ) , equation ( [ 11 ] ) can be written @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are true at all times . of course equation ( [ 17 ] ) can be used to eliminate any one of the 4 @xmath57 s in equation ( [ 15 ] ) , restoring it to an equation that is explicitly dependent on just 4 observationally determined constants ( 3 @xmath57 s and @xmath58 ) . with the additional definition @xmath59 employed in the ( gr ) literature , one has ( exclusively in gr ) @xmath60 , whereupon @xmath61 corresponds to flat space . but",
    "@xmath62 with @xmath57 defined in equation ( [ 18 ] ) has no such special significance in pv , and therefore the substitution ( [ 18 ] ) is less useful when pv and gr are being compared in parallel , and so will not be employed here .",
    "also , in the flat - space version of pv presently under consideration , @xmath63 signifies non - zero overall energy , with no contribution from the spatial variation of @xmath7 . by contrast , in the friedmann equation of gr , @xmath63 always signifies a contribution from the ( non - flat ) geometry - it is not an arbitrary constant of integration .",
    "from equation ( [ 15 ] ) the current age as a function of the @xmath57 is @xmath64 in the case of gr ( @xmath45 ) the operand of the square root is always positive as @xmath65 because @xmath66 is positive .",
    "therefore in gr one is free to suppose that @xmath67 was the initial state of affairs , and take the age as the proper time elapsed since then .",
    "by contrast in pv ( @xmath46 ) the scale factor can not shrink to zero else the operand of the square root will go negative . defining the age as the proper time since the most recent minimum ( including the case that the scale factor oscillates ) , @xmath68 is the smallest real positive root of @xmath69 evidently @xmath70 at that point , and therefore the expansion is initially exclusively quadratic - i.e. is not a ` bang ' .",
    "the early history is decided by the magnitude of the initial ( and therefore minimum ) scale factor given by the solution of equation ( [ 20 ] ) , for which some estimate of the value of the @xmath57 coefficients is necessary .",
    "the cmb mass - equivalent energy density is @xmath71 ( the contribution from stellar radiation is around 20% of this value and can be ignored relative to the imprecision of this analysis ) .",
    "taking @xmath72 , giving a ` hubble time ' @xmath73 gyr , gives ( from equation ( [ 16 ] ) ) @xmath74 .",
    "the widest possible range for the matter density is @xmath75 ( absorbing therein any uncertainty in @xmath76 ) .",
    "the lower limit corresponds to luminous baryonic matter ( only ) .",
    "the upper limit is supplied by , for instance , fitting super - nova data to the ( gr ) friedmann equation - see for example @xcite and @xcite .",
    "although the applicability to pv of such a large value for the upper limit is questionable , it will turn out not to make any difference to the conclusion of this section .    to achieve a lepton era",
    "requires a temperature of around @xmath77 and therefore an initial scale factor of no more than @xmath78 . at those temperatures , the matter term in equation ( [ 20 ] )",
    "is certainly negligible compared to the radiation term , and therefore one can take @xmath79 equation ( [ 17 ] ) gives that the magnitudes of @xmath80 and @xmath81 can differ at most by a number of order unity , from which it is deduced that the first term in equation ( [ 21 ] ) is negligible compared with the second term .",
    "therefore @xmath82 but such a large number has un - physical consequences on the age , for example , which can be shown as follows .",
    "with reference to equation ( [ 19 ] ) , over the interval @xmath83 , the very large @xmath66 makes the square root very small everywhere except when @xmath51 is very close to @xmath84 .",
    "since @xmath80 and @xmath81 have similar magnitudes , it follows that @xmath85 and @xmath86 over the region of importance",
    ". therefore equation ( [ 19 ] ) is well approximated by @xmath87 rearranging a little and then performing the integral : @xmath88 using the numbers above , this gives an age of only 540 yrs .",
    "consequently it must be concluded that pv cosmology is incapable of accommodating either a lepton or a baryon era .",
    "existence of a radiation era requires that the initial radiation energy density is at least equal to that of matter : @xmath89 using this in equation ( [ 20 ] ) ( where @xmath90 comes from equation ( [ 17 ] ) , but in any case @xmath91 and so can be neglected ) gives @xmath92 the upper limit corresponding to @xmath93 the approximation used for the lepton era , ( [ 23 ] ) , gives @xmath94 which , using the numbers above , gives an age less than 7.2 gyr .",
    "however , that approximation required @xmath95 , so this result can not be expected to be very accurate . in fact an accurate numerical evaluation of equation ( [ 19 ] ) with @xmath96 gives an age of 6.6 gyr or less , the upper limit corresponding to @xmath97 .",
    "this age is unacceptably short - too small to accommodate main - sequence behaviour in globular clusters for example @xcite .",
    "it must be concluded that pv cosmology can not encompass an era of radiation domination . in short , combining the conclusions of this and the previous section , pv cosmology starts with a big whimper .",
    "current estimates of the matter density based upon observation of the proportions of the light elements inferred from big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) are around @xmath98 . but given the absence of a baryonic era in pv , the theory is denied the chain of inference that leads from bbn to this value .",
    "further , though recent observations of super - nova lead to @xmath99 - the difference between this value of @xmath0 and the value inferred from bbn is missing matter - these super - nova @xmath100 are due ( effectively ) to regression of the data onto the curve predicted by equation ( [ 15 ] ) when @xmath101 , which results can not be carried over into pv , where @xmath102 with the bases for large contributions from dark and missing matter gone , it seems that at least for the present pv should be examined with an @xmath103 much closer to the observed - luminous - density , plus whatever component is found to come from the neutrino .",
    "this conclusion is vulnerable to revision however , if a significant dark - matter contribution turns out to be demanded for other reasons , such as , for example , anomalous rotation of spiral galaxies .",
    "a consequence of the non - zero initial scale factor is the upper limit it imposes on the cosmological redshift of distant objects : @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the smallest positive root of equation ( [ 20 ] ) ( @xmath106 - and therefore @xmath107 - are functions of the @xmath100 ) .",
    "1 is a plot of the maximum redshift versus matter density for @xmath108 and @xmath109 obtained from a numerical solution of equation ( [ 20 ] ) .",
    "it is observed that pv can accommodate all the observed redshifts provided there is an overall deficit in the energy density . at the time of writing the largest claimed redshift for a radio galaxy",
    "is tn j0924 - 2201 at @xmath110 @xcite .",
    "2 shows that if , axiomatically , ( say ) @xmath108 , then pv is incompatible with a cosmological origin of redshifts beyond 3 , since these correspond to @xmath111 - the luminous mass density . since the observational upper limit on the redshift is subject to constant review , it is not possible to use that to deduce a firm relation between @xmath81 and @xmath112 in pv .",
    "loose constraints on the range of these parameters can be inferred from figs . 2 and 3 , which shows simultaneously how they affect the maximum redshift , the current age , and the deceleration parameter over different ranges .",
    "in both figures redshifts beyond 10 are increasingly crowded and have been suppressed .",
    "broadly , one sees pv requires that @xmath113 the intersection of these two domains giving a reasonable range of ages , and a range of redshifts that encompass the most distant observations to date .",
    "note however that in light of the arguments of the previous section ( absence of motivation for dark or missing matter ) , current observations constrain @xmath0 to the lower end of this range .",
    "[ fig1 ]      it would appear from the form of equation ( [ 15 ] ) that the deceleration parameter @xmath114 , since it is independent of the scale of both @xmath51 and @xmath41 , is independent of @xmath52 .",
    "however , taking into account that the four @xmath100 on the right hand side of equation ( [ 15 ] ) are internally related in a way that depends on @xmath52 through equation ( [ 17 ] ) , the pv prediction for the deceleration parameter as a function of the three remaining true degrees of freedom differs from that of gr . differentiating both sides of equation ( [ 15 ] ) one obtains @xmath115 and therefore @xmath116 it may be observed that in pv , because the first derivative of the scale factor is zero when @xmath117 ( it is infinite in the flrw cosmologies ) , the deceleration parameter defined above is negative infinite there .",
    "the present ( and therefore ` local ' ) value for both theories is @xmath118 where equation ( [ 17 ] ) was used . for pv in particular",
    "@xmath119 rearranging equation ( [ 29 ] ) , one sees that the condition for a locally accelerating universe ( @xmath120 ) is that @xmath121 from equation ( [ 25 ] ) it is observed that the plausible range of @xmath81 and @xmath103 encompasses both local acceleration and deceleration .",
    "specifically , the range of @xmath122 consistent with equation ( [ 25 ] ) is @xmath123 contours of constant @xmath122 versus @xmath81 and @xmath103 are plotted in figs . 2 and 3 .",
    "some caution is necessary in comparing published results of @xmath122 with the value predicted by equation ( [ 29 ] ) : where @xmath122 is deduced effectively from a parametric fit of the friedmann equation to the scale factor as deduced from redshift and brightness data , e.g. @xcite , the reported value will be applicable exclusively to gr and not pv .    [ fig2 ]    [ fig3 ]",
    "the condition for future collapse is that the right hand side of equation ( [ 15 ] ) becomes zero at some @xmath124 , i.e. equation ( [ 20 ] ) possesses more than one real positive solution . at that point @xmath125 and the expansion stalls and",
    "will subsequently reverse . combining equations ( [ 17 ] ) and ( [ 20 ] )",
    "gives that future collapse requires @xmath126 to have a solution in the range @xmath127 .",
    "solving equation ( [ 32 ] ) for @xmath80 , @xmath128 one sees that the range @xmath129 corresponds to @xmath130 an infinite vacuum density corresponds to a turn - around point at the present time when @xmath31 .",
    "( a turn - around earlier than this has effectively been excluded by the normalisation process in which the @xmath57 defined in equation ( [ 16 ] ) are based upon on @xmath31 present - day values . )",
    "the condition @xmath131 is a special ` critical ' case and is discussed separately below . inserting equation ( [ 34 ] ) into equation ( [ 17 ] ) , the constraint on the total energy for future collapse is @xmath132 solutions of equation ( [ 15 ] ) satisfying equation ( [ 35 ] ) are necessarily oscillating and symmetric about the times of maximum and minimum scale factor . if the constraint equation ( [ 35 ] ) is not satisfied , then the expansion is monotonic ( ` open ' ) .",
    "the locus of this constraint is shown as a heavy line in fig .",
    "3 . ( the line may be regarded as a contour of constant period for the particular case that the period is infinite - other equal - period contours could be drawn above this line . ) it may be observed that a limited range of plausible combinations of age and maximum redshift lie above this line - the majority of plausible combinations lie below .",

    "the principal characteristics of the scalar , flat - space , pv cosmology investigated above are summarized below :    1 .",
    "compared with gr , the scale factor evolves according to a friedmann - like equation in which the @xmath150 term is multiplied by @xmath151 , with all the other terms appearing in the same way .",
    "a consequence is that pv cosmology has no big bang , but starts smoothly from a non - zero scale factor .",

    "pv can predict an age , deceleration parameter , and maximum possible redshift for particular values of mass density and overall system energy compatible with observation , without missing mass , and without a vacuum term .",
    "pv cosmologies compatible with observation can be monotonic , critical , or oscillating . 8 .",
    "compatibility demands that pv contain a significant contribution from the vacuum , or an offset to the total energy , or both .",
    "@xmath7-field radiation induced by the motion of ` local ' matter can be decoupled from cosmologically induced variations provided the ( retarded ) distance to the radiation source is small on the cosmological scale .",

    "his interpretation rests , however , upon the assumption of particles interacting principally electromagnetically , whereas the ` particle ' sources of mass contemplated here are stars interacting gravitationally .",
    "further , in the latter case relativistic orbital speeds are possible only in the presence of strong fields - the weak - field limit is necessarily non - relativistic . consequently equation ( [ 38 ] ) can not be extended to the relativistic domain , which obviates interpretation of the relativistic terms and discussion of the applicability of the virial theorem to this case .",

    "the first two terms of equation ( [ 41 ] ) are the monopole and dipole contributions to the potential , proportional respectively to the total energy and momentum of the source matter . for a closed system ( ignoring the radiation itself ) , these are constant in time and can not contribute to radiation since the latter is driven by non - vanishing time - derivatives of the potential ( see below ) . for radiation ,",
    "therefore , it is sufficient to take @xmath166      the euler equation for distant test particles gives a force proportional to @xmath167 which , in the far field , is directed away from the source - the radiation is longitudinally polarized . for maximum sensitivity therefore , pv radiation detectors should be aligned correspondingly . since this is orthogonal to the direction predicted by gr , direct detection of gravitational radiation from a cosmological source would be a decisive test in favor of one of the two theories .    disregarding the polarization , the total power radiated is the rate of energy crossing a closed surface far from the source .",

    "since @xmath178 and @xmath179 are symmetric they can be diagonalised by a similarity transform , @xmath180 , where @xmath181 is diagonal and @xmath182 is a real orthogonal matrix representing a proper rotation .",

    "( the jacobian for the transformation is @xmath187 ) writing @xmath188 one has @xmath189 in a cartesian basis @xmath190 has only two distinct values : one for all the diagonal terms , and one for all the off - diagonal terms .",
    "therefore @xmath191 where @xmath192 one finds by explicit calculation that @xmath193 and @xmath194 using this and that the trace is insensitive to rotations , one finally obtains @xmath195 by contrast , the gr result is : @xmath196 where @xmath197 is the reduced quadrupole moment tensor @xmath198 using that @xmath199 the gr and pv results can be combined into a single expression @xmath200 where , as before , the values @xmath201 correspond to gr and pv respectively .",

    "using that , for any function @xmath215 , @xmath216 and that the rate of change of phase of an elliptical orbit is @xmath217 where @xmath48 is a constant , the time - average of equation ( [ 59 ] ) is @xmath218 performing the integrations and recalling equation ( [ 56 ] ) one obtains @xmath219 where @xmath220 is the model - dependent ` enhancement factor ' , with coefficient chosen so that @xmath221 .",

    "the value of the ratio in the limit of perfectly circular orbits ( @xmath223 ) is exactly 2/3 , and changes only by 1.5% across the full range of eccentricity . that the ratio is less than one is to be expected given the reduced number of polarizations available to the vacuum",

    "this is in accord with divergence between gr and other theories that have different rules governing generation of radiation @xcite .      using the kepler results that the energy of the binary system is @xmath224 , and its period is @xmath225",
    ", one has @xmath226 and therefore @xcite @xmath227 where @xmath228 and where the period has been used to eliminate the semi - major axis .",
    "estimates for the masses may be obtained from the rate of periastron advance , @xmath229 , and the time - dilation parameter @xmath230 in the case there is apsidal motion @xcite .",
    "it is important that though inference of these quantities from observation is potentially model dependent , they are computed using the static metric of the center of mass system , in which case the ppn expansion of pv is known to give the same result as gr to the required order @xcite . consequently , the pv - dependent observational inference of these quantities , and therefore @xmath231 and @xmath232 , is the same as that of gr .",
    "then , if one regards ( 66 ) as a theoretical prediction for the decay rate @xmath233 in terms of the observationally determined quantities @xmath234 , @xmath231 and @xmath232 , it is concluded that the prediction from pv differs from that by gr by the factor given in equation ( [ 65 ] ) of approximately 2/3 .",
    "but since the observed decay rate of psr 1913 + 16 agrees with the prediction of gr to better than 1% , with more recent research concerned with checking relativistic corrections and other refinements of the analysis presented here @xcite , it follows that pv is incompatible with observation .",

    "pv predicts gravitational radiation with the following properties    1 .",
    "radiation is polarized along the direction of propagation ; there is just one polarization degree of freedom .",
    "the orbital decay due to radiation of a binary system is always close to 2/3 that predicted by gr , with the exact relation as a function of eccentricity given by equation ( [ 65 ] ) , and is plotted in fig .",
    "this prediction is at variance with the observational data for psr 1913 + 16 .",
    "at the time of dicke s writing , his theory passed the then four standard tests of gr .",
    "dicke did not investigate the cosmological predictions of the theory , which are reported here for the first time .",
    "the major shortcoming of pv reported immediately above - its failure to predict the correct ( observed ) orbital decay rate of a binary system due to radiation - was unknown to dicke .",
    "the factor of 2/3 disagreement between pv and gr possibly can be attributed to the reduced number of polarization states permitted to the radiation . depending on the details , a theory accommodating vacuum anisotropy has the potential to accommodate two independent transverse polarization degrees of freedom of radiation , thereby bringing about agreement with the binary pulsar data ( and gr ) .",
    "in fact dicke briefly considered the possibility of an anisotropic version of the theory as plausible , but argued in favor of the scalar version , since it was sufficient to explain the standard test data available at that time @xcite .",
    "the yilmaz theory is a candidate for the generalized - anisotropic - version of pv . as remarked in the introduction , the yilmaz theory shares with pv the electromagnetic motivation , and , in the case that only @xmath12 is non - zero , the same form for the metric .",
    "this suggests that pv may turn out to be a truncated version of the yilmaz theory , in the same sense that a theory of electromagnetic interaction would be truncated by keeping @xmath156 but ignoring @xmath235 . since the yilmaz theory has the full compliment of 10 functional degrees of freedom in the metric , it has the potential to resolve the problem of the reduced radiation rate suffered by pv . to date",
    "there have been no published studies of the cosmological predictions of the yilmaz theory , so it would be interesting to pursue this matter further in a future report . since the friedmann equation is predicated on isotropy and homogeneity on the cosmological scale ,",
    "it is conceivable that such a development will affect only the compatibility with the binary pulsar data through the polarization states available to radiation , without affecting the cosmological predictions of pv reported above .",
    "no conclusions are possible based on these very broad arguments .",
    "it is recalled that for the einstein equation with a cosmological term to retain its tensor form , it is necessary that the vacuum action must have the form @xmath236 . with this",
    ", the flrw flat - space metric ( i.e. with line element equation ( [ 12 ] ) ) gives that the vacuum contribution appears in the lagrangian density as @xmath237 ( equation ( [ 5 ] ) ) .",
    "the pv field @xmath7 , however , is a scalar , and therefore its ( euler - lagrange ) equation of motion is a scalar .",
    "it follows that there is no such constraint on the vacuum contribution to the pv action . in principle",
    "therefore , other vacua may be contemplated , with potentially radical consequences for the resulting cosmology . in the absence of a solid mathematical basis for a particular form for the vacuum term , some other argument in favor of a particular alternative would have to be provided in order to proceed further .",
    "it is noteworthy though that pv cosmology is in closest agreement with observation when the vacuum term is close to zero . given this , and the arbitrariness of the function dependence of the vacuum term on the scale factor , it could be argued that the vacuum term be expunged from pv altogether .",
    "alternatively , one might argue that with no constraints on the vacuum dependence on the scale factor there is some justification for regarding the total energy term ( @xmath81 in equation ( [ 15 ] ) ) as a novel , negative - energy vacuum term .",
    "that is , equation ( [ 5 ] ) could be replaced with @xmath238 where now @xmath50 is a positive constant , which would then generate the friedmann equation @xmath239",
    "the advantage of this view is that there is now no arbitrary overall energy - the total energy is now zero . of course",
    ", the arbitrariness in @xmath81 has just been subsumed into the arbitrariness of the vacuum .",
    "recalling that the pv action is as if the matter and fields are in a curved space - time with line element ( [ pvlineelement ] ) , ( of which the flat - space flrw line - element of equation ( [ 7 ] ) is obviously , therefore , a special case ) , it is observed that dicke s scalar pv is committed to an isotropic space . in the case that @xmath7 is just a function of time - as it is here - then equation ( [ 7 ] ) is the flrw flat space metric ( with proper time @xmath41 then given by @xmath240 ) .",
    "it is obvious from the form equation ( [ 7 ] ) that the other flrw space - geometries ( spherical and hyperbolic ) are not accommodated pv .",
    "the line elements corresponding to those geometries were first derived independent of gr ( see for example @xcite ) based upon milne s cosmological principle , which , if regarded as an axiom , dictates that pv cosmology entertain only the flat - space metric .",
    "it is noteworthy that the specific form of the three flrw line elements ( plus , of course , the friedmann equation ) can be generated from ` within ' gr , i.e. without direct appeal to the cosmological principle , and without enforcing any symmetry by hand .",
    "for example , it sufficient ( in order to generate all flrw three metrics ) , that that the matter is required to be static and uniformly distributed ( in whatever space it exists ) , and that the metric can be written in the form @xmath241 given that this derivation of the flrw metrics is , in some sense , achieved more ` directly ' by the theory of gravity ( rather than by a symmetry principle ) , it could be argued that this is the physically superior of the two routes to the metric . from that standpoint",
    ", a similar procedure should be used to decide on the cosmological metrics appropriate to pv .",
    "to that end , alternatives to the flat space assumption might arise from an ` effective ' cosmologically - appropriate version of the pv action , equation ( [ 2 ] ) , that does not , a priori , exclude spatial variation of @xmath7 : @xmath242       { + \\frac{\\rho_m}{\\sqrt k } + \\frac{\\rho_r}{k } + k\\rho_v }      \\biggr\\}\\ , .",
    "\\end{split}\\ ] ] variation of @xmath7 gives the euler equation @xmath243 where the @xmath244 are constant . in principle , given plausible boundary conditions for , say , @xmath7 and @xmath245 everywhere at @xmath246 , solutions to equation ( [ 71 ] ) should provide cosmologically acceptable functions of @xmath7 that vary in space and time and which will generate pv analogues of the flrw metrics .      in the hamiltonian corresponding to the action in equation ( [ 70 ] )",
    "the spatial gradient term contributes positively , with the same sign as the matter and radiation terms ( the sign of the vacuum term is not fixed ) .",
    "consequently any spatial variation in the metric increases the overall system energy .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the effect of the spherical and hyperbolic flrw metrics in gr , which contribute terms of opposite signs to the friedmann equation for the scale factor @xmath247 . since agreement with observation in a flat - space zero vacuum cosmology already requires that pv",
    "have non - zero positive energy ( i.e. @xmath248 identified above ) , it follows that the introduction of space - dependent forms for @xmath7 can not be used to offset this requirement . in other words ,",
    "pv without a contribution from the vacuum can not have zero overall energy in any space - time .",
    "analysis above showed that flat - space pv has no baryon , lepton , or radiation eras . though the baryon and lepton eras were shown to be orders of magnitude beyond the reach of pv , the same was not true of the radiation era , which was discounted on the basis of an inferred age of 6.6 gyr or less .",
    "it is conceivable that a spatially varying @xmath7-field satisfying equation ( [ 71 ] ) with appropriately - chosen boundary conditions could satisfy the observational constraints on age etc , and bring a radiation era within the scope of pv by a small adjustment of the metric at very early times ( yet without significantly changing the later evolution ) .      with reference to equation ( [ 71 ] )",
    ", the vacuum behaviour of the @xmath7-field near a massive object ( ignoring cosmological influences ) is given by @xmath249 setting @xmath250 gives the laplace equation , @xmath251 , from which it is inferred that @xmath252 where the @xmath253 are spherical harmonics , and where @xmath254 and @xmath255 are arbitrary constants to be determined by the boundary conditions .",
    "but far from the source of the field @xmath7 must return to a constant value , so all the @xmath256 and @xmath257 must be zero , and therefore @xmath258 where the remaining @xmath259 can be determined by the conditions at the surface of the source .",
    "the important feature of equation ( [ 74 ] ) is that , regardless of the mass distribution , @xmath7 is everywhere finite outside the mass . recalling the pv line element , ( [ pvlineelement ] )",
    ", it is seen that the coefficient of the @xmath260 term in the line element is never zero , from which it is deduced that pv does not admit event horizons outside the matter distribution ; pv predicts that light from the surface of any star , however massive , can not be infinitely redshifted , i.e. , a star can grow to an arbitrary density without disappearing from view .",
    "hence it is concluded that pv does not admit black holes .",
    "this statement does not address the issue of stability ; properly applied with an appropriate equation of state , pv may or may not concur with gr predictions for instability and collapse .",
    "at this point the only certain ( but important ) difference is that any collapsed star will nonetheless remain visible , albeit with an arbitrarily large redshift . as a result of this difference with gr ,",
    "a more thorough appraisal of the validity of pv might need to take into account the possibility that gr - designated cosmological redshifts may have a significant gravitational component .",
    "since , as pointed out in section [ sec : anisotropy ] , the exponential form of the vacuum metric , equation ( [ 74 ] ) , is common to pv and the yilmaz theory , the lack of black holes is a prediction common to both theories .",
    "several authors have presented arguments in favor of a quasi - steady - state cosmology ( qssc ) that has no big bang @xcite .",
    "a presentation of both sides of the qssc - gr debate may be found in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "lacking bbn , they have argued that observed abundances of the light elements are the result of stellar rather than big bang nucleosynthesis - a feature of potential relevance to pv .",
    "also in common with pv , qssc also lacks an era of radiation domination .",
    "qssc claims that the cmb is thermalized starlight , thermalisation occurring principally in the most contracted phase of an oscillating cosmology .",
    "this component of the qssc hypothesis is potentially relevant exclusively to the oscillating pv cosmologies , including the particular example discussed above and shown in fig .",
    "4 ( which happens to have the same oscillation period , of around 100 gyr , as that preferred by qssc ) . the degree of thermalisation of light from a previous cycle will depend on the rate and depth of the contraction , the details of which differ in qssc and pv .",
    "further investigation would be necessary to test the viability of this idea within pv .",
