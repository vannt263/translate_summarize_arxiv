    "superconductivity is characterized by exactly zero electrical resistance and expulsion of magnetic fields occurring in superconductors when cooled below @xmath6 .",
    "the later phenomenon is so - called meissner effect @xcite , i.e. , a superconductor is placed in an external magnetic field @xmath7 smaller than the upper critical field @xmath8 , the magnetic field @xmath7 penetrates only to a penetration depth @xmath9 and is excluded from the main body of the system .",
    "this magnetic - field - penetration depth is a fundamental parameter of superconductors , and provides a rather direct measurement of the superfluid density @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) @xcite , which is proportional to the squared amplitude of the macroscopic wave function . in particular , the variation of the magnetic - field - penetration depth as a function of doping and temperature gives the information about the nature of quasiparticle excitations and their dynamics .",
    "moreover , the magnetic - field - penetration depth can be also used as a probe of the pairing symmetry , since it can distinguish between a fully gapped and a nodal quasiparticle excitation spectrum @xcite .",

    "this @xmath13-@xmath14 model ( [ tjham ] ) is the strong coupling limit of the hubbard model and the crucial difficulty of its solution lies in enforcing the local constraint of no zero electron occupancy . in the case of the hole doping , an intuitively appealing approach to implement the local constraint of no double electron occupancy and",
    "the charge - spin separation scheme is the slave - particle formalism @xcite , however , the local constraint of no double electron occupancy is explicitly replaced by a global constraint in the actual calculations . following the charge - spin separation scheme ,",
    "a fermion - spin theory has been developed @xcite , where the local constraint of no double electron occupancy can be treated properly in the actual calculations .",

    "the physics of the no double electron occupancy in the fermion - spin theory is taken into account by representing the fermion operator @xmath30 as a composite object created by @xcite , @xmath32 where the spinful fermion operator @xmath33 describes the charge degree of freedom of the hole together with some effects of spin configuration rearrangements due to the presence of the doped electron itself ( charge carrier ) , while the spin operator @xmath34 represents the spin degree of freedom of the hole , then the local constraint of no double occupancy is satisfied in the actual calculations . in this fermion - spin representation ( [ fermion - spin ] ) , the @xmath13-@xmath14 model ( [ tjham - hole ] ) can be expressed as @xcite , @xmath35 where @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is the charge - carrier doping concentration . at half - filling , the @xmath13-@xmath14 model ( [ cssham ] ) is reduced to the af heisenberg model on a triangular lattice . in the early days of the spin - liquid",

    "based on the @xmath13-@xmath14 model in the fermion - spin representation , we have developed a kinetic - energy - driven sc mechanism @xcite in the case without aflro for a microscopic description of the sc - state of square - lattice cuprate superconductors .",
    "this kinetic - energy - driven superconductivity is purely electronic without phonons , where the charge - carrier pairing interaction arises directly from the kinetic energy by the exchange of spin excitations in the higher powers of the doping concentration .",
    "in particular , the kinetic - energy - driven sc - state is controlled by both the sc gap and quasiparticle coherence , then the maximal sc transition temperature @xmath6 occurs around the optimal doping , and decreases in both the underdoped and overdoped regimes . on the other hand ,",

    "is plotted in fig .",
    "[ penetration - depth - doping ] .",
    "it is seen that below temperatures @xmath193 , @xmath191 is practically independent temperature , which is a reflection of the absence of the d - wave gap nodes at the large charge - carrier fermi surface .",
    "however , above temperatures @xmath194 , @xmath191 increases rapidly with increasing temperature .",
    "in particular , we have fitted our present theoretical result of the magnetic - field - penetration depth difference @xmath180 , and the fitted result is shown in inset of fig .",
    "[ penetration - depth - doping ] .",
    "we thus find that @xmath195 vary exponentially as a function of temperature ( @xmath196 $ ] with @xmath182 and @xmath183 ) , which is expected result in the case without the d - wave gap nodes at the large charge - carrier fermi surface .",
    "an external magnetic field acts on the sc - state of triangular - lattice superconductors as a perturbation . in the linear response form ( [ current - kernel ] ) , the nonlocal relation between the supercurrent and the vector potential in the coordinate space holds due to the finite size of charge - carrier pairs .",
    "in particular , the size of charge - carrier pairs is of the order of the coherence length @xmath197 , where @xmath198 is the charge - carrier velocity at the large charge - carrier fermi surface , which shows that the size of charge - carrier pairs is momentum dependent . in general case , although the external magnetic field decays on the scale of the magnetic - field - penetration length @xmath191 , any nonlocal contributions to measurable quantities are of the order of @xmath199 , where the ginzburg ",
    "landau parameter @xmath200 is the ratio of the magnetic - field - penetration depth @xmath9 and the coherence length @xmath201 .",
    "however , for the charge - carrier d - wave pair gap ( [ d - wave - gap ] ) , there is no gap nodes at the large charge - carrier fermi surface . in this case , the momentum dependent coherence length @xmath202 can be replaced approximately with the isotropic one @xmath203 , and then the condition for the local limit is satisfied . as a consequence ,",
    "triangular - lattice superconductors are type - ii superconductors due to the existence of the anisotropic energy gap over the large charge - carrier fermi surface , where nonlocal effects are negligible , and then the electrodynamics is purely local and the magnetic field decays exponentially over a length of the order of a few hundreds nm . in this local limit , the pure d - wave pairing state in the kinetic - energy - driven sc mechanism",
    "gives a temperature dependence of the magnetic - field - penetration depth as @xmath204 $ ] .",
    "this is much different from the case in square - lattice cuprate superconductors , where the characteristic feature of the d - wave charge - carrier pair gap is the existence of the four nodes at the charge - carrier fermi surface , and then the quasiparticle excitations are gapless and affect particularly the physical properties at the extremely low temperatures . these gapless quasiparticle excitations in square - lattice cuprate superconductors lead to a divergence of the coherence length @xmath202 around the gap nodes , and then the behavior of the temperature dependence of the magnetic - field - penetration depth depends sensitively on the quasiparticle scattering . at the extremely low temperatures ,",
    "the quasiparticles selectively locate around the gap nodal region , and then the major contribution to measurable quantities comes from these quasiparticles . in this case , the ginzburg ",
    "landau ratio @xmath205 around the gap nodal region is no longer large enough for the system to belong to the class of type - ii superconductors , and the condition of the local limit is not satisfied @xcite , which leads to the system in the extreme nonlocal limit , and therefore the nonlinear behavior in the temperature dependence of the magnetic - field - penetration depth is observed experimentally @xcite . on the other hand , with increasing temperatures ,",
    "the quasiparticles around the gap nodal region become excited out of the condensate , and then the nonlocal effect fades away , which leads to that the magnetic - field - penetration depth crossovers to the linear temperature dependence @xcite .",
    "however , the present result of the temperature dependence of the magnetic - field - penetration depth in triangular - lattice superconductors is very similar to the case in conventional superconductors @xcite , where the characteristic feature is the existence of the isotropic energy gap at the fermi surface , and then the temperature dependence of the magnetic - field - penetration depth exhibits an exponential behavior .     for @xmath68 .",
    "[ superfluid - density - doping ] ]    now we turn to discuss the doping dependence of the superfluid density @xmath206 , which is a measure of the phase stiffness , and is defined in terms of the magnetic - field - penetration depth @xmath191 as @xmath207 . in this case",
    ", we have performed firstly a calculation for the doping dependence of @xmath10 in triangular - lattice superconductors for all levels of doping throughout the sc dome , and the result is plotted in fig .",
    "[ superfluid - density - doping ] . in analogy to the dome - like shape of the doping dependence of @xmath6 shown in fig .",
    "[ tc - doping ] , @xmath10 also displays a dome - like shape of the doping dependence , i.e. , it increases with increasing doping in the lower doped regime , and reaches a maximum ( a peak ) around the _ critical doping _",
    "@xmath208 , then decreases in the higher doped regime .",
    "moreover , @xmath10 of triangular - lattice superconductors in the underdoped regime vanishes more or less linearly with decrease of the charge - carrier doping concentration @xmath209 . in square - lattice cuprate superconductors ,",
    "one of the most unconventional natures is that @xmath6 scales with @xmath10 following the so - called uemura relation as @xmath210 in the underdoped regime @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to know if triangular - lattice superconductors also obey this relation . in this case , we have fitted the relation between @xmath6 and @xmath10 in the underdoped regime , and the result shows that triangular - lattice superconductors satisfy the similar uemura relation in the underdoped regime @xcite . incorporating the result obtained from square - lattice cuprate superconductors @xcite , it thus implies that the uemura relation may be a universal relation in strongly correlated superconductors in despite of whether the gap nodes at the charge - carrier fermi surface exist or not .",
    "the essential physics of the dome - like shape of the doping dependence of @xmath10 in triangular - lattice superconductors is the same as in the case of square - lattice superconductors @xcite , and also can be attributed to the dome - like shape of the doping dependence of @xmath112 .",
    "this follows a fact that @xmath211 in triangular - lattice superconductors is intriguingly related to the current - current correlation function , and therefore the variation of the superfluid density with doping is coupled to the doping dependence of the charge - carrier pair gap parameter @xmath112 . in particular , the charge - carrier pair gap parameter @xmath112 measures the strength of the binding of two charge carriers into a charge - carrier pair . on the other hand ,",
    "the superfluid density @xmath10 is a measurement of the phase stiffness , and is proportional to the squared amplitude of the charge - carrier pair macroscopic wave functions . in this case , both @xmath10 and @xmath112 describe the different aspects of the same charge - carrier quasiparticles , and then the dome - like shape of the doping dependence of @xmath10 in fig .",
    "[ superfluid - density - doping ] is a natural consequence of the dome - like shape of the doping dependence of @xmath112 shown in fig .",

    "[ superfluid - density - temp ] ]    the superfluid density shown in fig .",
    "[ superfluid - density - doping ] also is strongly temperature dependence .",
    "when the temperature @xmath158 , the kernel of the response function @xmath212 , and then @xmath213 as mentioned above , which leads to @xmath214 , and is consistent with the result of the effective superfluid density obtained from eq .",
    "( [ superfluid - density ] ) . for a better understanding of the basic behavior of @xmath206 as a function of temperature",
    ", we have made a series of calculations for @xmath206 at different temperatures , and the result of @xmath206 as a function of temperature at @xmath169 for @xmath215 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ superfluid - density - temp ] in comparison with the corresponding experimental result @xcite of na@xmath1coo@xmath2h@xmath3o ( solid square ) .",
    "our present calculations thus qualitatively reproduce the overall evolution of the superfluid density with temperature in na@xmath1coo@xmath2h@xmath3o @xcite .",
    "in corresponding to the result of the temperature dependence of the magnetic - field - penetration depth shown in fig .",
    "[ penetration - depth - doping ] , @xmath216 is also independence of temperature below temperatures @xmath193 , and then decreases dramatically with increasing temperature for temperatures @xmath194 , eventually vanishing together with superconductivity at @xmath6 .",
    "the calculation based on the kinetic - energy - driven sc mechanism with the d - wave charge - carrier pair gap ( [ d - wave - gap ] ) thus gives a good agreement with the observed superfluid density data of na@xmath1coo@xmath2h@xmath3o .",
    "within the framework of the kinetic - energy driven superconductivity , we have performed a calculation of the doping and temperature dependence of the meissner effect in triangular - lattice superconductors for all temperatures @xmath217 throughout the sc dome .",
    "our results indicate that the magnetic - field - penetration depth shows an exponential temperature dependence due to the absence of the d - wave gap nodes at the large charge carrier fermi surface .",
    "in particular , the experimental result of the temperature dependence of the superfluid density in cobaltate superconductors can be qualitatively described in terms of the d - wave pairing state . however , as a natural consequence of the dome - like shape of the doping dependence of the charge - carrier pair gap parameter and @xmath6 , the superfluid density increases with increasing doping in the lower doped regime , and reaches a highest value ( a peak ) around the critical doping , then decreases in the higher doped regime .",
