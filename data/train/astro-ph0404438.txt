    "the positional accuracy of these surveys is only @xmath6arcsec , and optical counterparts are typically faint .",
    "hence it has been difficult to identify and measure the redshifts of a substantial fraction of these submillimeter - selected galaxies ( smgs ) .",

    "the value of @xmath10 is degenerate with temperature , in the sense that models in which @xmath12 is approximately constant provide similarly accurate descriptions of the sed ( see fig.2 of bbc03 ) .",
    "this effect could be important if @xmath8 were treated as a real physical temperature , but when @xmath8 is used as the key descriptive parameter in the sed the effect of this degeneracy between the fitted values of @xmath8 and @xmath10 is not important .",
    "the slope of the mid - ir spectrum @xmath13 is set by a second parameter , which has little effect on the value of @xmath9 at fixed @xmath8 .",
    "spectroscopic redshifts are especially important for understanding the seds of smgs as there is a very significant , pernicious degeneracy between the inferred dust temperature @xmath8 and redshift @xmath14 , which only allows accurate measurement of the quantity @xmath15 ( blain 1999 ; bbc03 ) .",
    "the large chapman et al .",
    "sample of secure spectroscopic redshifts for smgs provides a way to break this degeneracy , and thus unambiguously reveals the range of sed properties of the high - redshift population of smgs .",

    "the presence of an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) might be expected to boost the radio flux density , leading to an overestimate of @xmath8 ( yun , reddy & condon 2001 ) .",

    "we also highlight the selection criteria for the smgs in fig.2 .",
    "the error bars to the @xmath8 are assigned by fitting sed templates to the colors of observed smgs , using a maximum - likelihood estimator combined with broad priors , and without imposing any condition on luminosity .",

    "the different galaxy samples occupy somewhat different regions of the @xmath9-@xmath8 plane shown in fig.1 .",
    "part of this separation is due to their distinct selection criteria .",
    "the low - redshift _ iras _ galaxies occupy a relatively well - defined strip , whether their seds are determined from either far - ir  submillimeter colors ( open squares ; dunne et al .  2000 ) or from radio",

    "the more distant stanford et al .",

    "these two samples match well at intermediate luminosities , @xmath32 , for which typical temperatures of about 40k are determined .",
    "it is likely that both of these samples are biased against galaxies with cooler dust temperatures , because their inclusion requires a detection at the relatively short observed wavelength of 60@xmath3 m .",
    "this corresponds to an even shorter restframe wavelength of about 45@xmath3 m for the typical galaxy in the stanford et al . sample .",
    "a few faint galaxies selected jointly at radio and mid - ir wavelengths are found to have seds consistent with lower temperatures ( garrett et al .",
    "2001 ; see also chapman et al .",
    "the new , large and more accurately defined chapman et al .",

    "the track of the @xmath9@xmath8 distribution of smg points in fig.2 appears to be relatively tight , but this does not necessarily reflect a tight intrinsic scatter in the properties of the smgs . rather , the shape of this distribution is determined mainly by the condition of a detectable submillimeter - wave flux density , as shown by the dashed curves that trace the limits to detection for a 5-mjy 850-@xmath3 m source in the chapman et al .",
    "( 2004a ) smg sample at a variety of redshifts in fig.2 .",
    "thus , it is impossible to select smgs in the high-@xmath8low-@xmath9 region shown in the figures at any redshift in existing submillimeter - wave surveys . in a deeper survey , as will be possible with the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ; wootten et al .",
    "2001 ) the region of the parameter space that can be probed will expand , and many high - redshift galaxies will then probably be found in this region .",
    "the nature of high - redshift galaxies means that there are many possible explanations for why they avoid the low - luminosity  high - temperature region of the @xmath9@xmath8 parameter space .",
    "they could have systematically different dust grain properties and spatial distributions of dust as compared with their more luminous companions , or they could be dusty galaxies at the start or end of a burst of enhanced star - formation / agn activity , either brightening from or fading into the distribution of much more normal quiescent galaxies .",
    "note that regular star - forming lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ; steidel et al .",
    "2004 ) will be found somewhere in the @xmath9@xmath8 plane at high redshifts ( fig.2d ) . by detecting their lower far - ir luminosities using alma",
    "it should be possible to understand the currently ambiguous relationship between the lbgs and smgs in more detail .    the corresponding conditions for radio detection at 1.4-ghz  that a galaxy must exceed a flux density of about 30@xmath3jy is also shown in fig.2 .",
    "the shape of the radio selection function is much less sensitive to temperature , depending much more strongly on luminosity , with a more intuitive redshift dependence .",
    "the absence of points at high - luminosities in the @xmath9@xmath8 diagram reflects the steep high - luminosity cutoff of the luminosity function of dusty galaxies  there are few very luminous objects to find .",
    "note that the observed strong luminosity evolution of dusty galaxies by a factor @xmath33 with @xmath34 for @xmath35 ( blain et al .",
    "1999 ) , is implicit in the results shown for different redshift ranges in fig.2 .",

    "this implies a radio  submillimeter  far - ir photometric redshift accuracy no better than @xmath38 based on the temperature  redshift degeneracy ( bbc03 ) for the typical smg spectroscopic redshift @xmath39 : this is in marked contrast to recent claims of much more accurate photometric redshifts by aretxaga et al .",
    "the presence of hotter dusty galaxies at slightly lower luminosities in the stanford et al .",
    "( 2000 ) sample ( fig.1 ) hints that photometric redshift errors could be even larger if smgs were selected down to deeper submillimeter flux density limits .",
    "photometric redshift techniques at shorter near- and mid - ir wavelengths offer better hope of progress , either using redshifted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah)/silicate dust grain absorption and emission features , or stellar spectral features ( simpson & eisenhardt 1999 ; sawicki 2002 ; efstathiou & rowan - robinson 2003 ) .",
    "regular multi - band near - ir , optical , uv photometric redshift techniques also hold promise , as many smgs have the expected optical colors for their spectroscopic redshift ( chapman et al",
    ".  2004a ) , despite having far - ir luminosities that are almost impossible to predict from the optical data .",
    "nevertheless , accurate positions , perhaps from radio or alma observations , are still necessary in order to confirm that a particular faint galaxy with a photometric redshift really is the counterpart to a particular smg .",
    "there is almost no overlap in physical properties between well - studied low - redshift _ iras _ galaxies and the existing catalogs of smgs , as shown in figs1 & 4 .",
    "these classes of galaxies occupy totally disjoint regions of the @xmath9@xmath8 parameter space , being separated by a factor of 30% in temperature at comparable luminosities , and by a factor of 10 in luminosity at comparable temperatures . in part this is a selection effect , imposed by the requirement of a 850-@xmath3 m flux density in excess of 5mjy at low redshifts and/or luminosities , as shown in fig.2 .",
    "however , the lack of overlap in the figure could also be a real astrophysical effect , perhaps reflecting either a more diffuse distribution of dust and stars or a lower typical interstellar medium metallicity in the high - redshift smgs as compared with the _ iras _ galaxies .",
    "spatially - resolved imaging of the radio , submillimeter or far - ir emission from these galaxies will be necessary to reveal the true relationship between these populations , its causes and the relative astrophysics of the _ iras _ and smg galaxy populations .",
    "we emphasize that spectroscopic redshifts for smgs are essential to draw all these conclusions : without them reliable temperature and thus luminosity information can not be derived .",
    "a significant fraction ( @xmath40% ) of the smg population with 850-@xmath3 m flux densities in excess of 5mjy are included in the chapman et al .",
    "( 2004a ) redshift sample ( fig.2 ) . unless there is a significant systematic shift in the seds of smgs at fainter flux densities ( @xmath41mjy ) , then slightly fainter , less luminous smgs will typically populate the region of fig.1 that lies between the existing smg samples and the dunne et al .",
    "( 2000 ) low - redshift _ iras _ galaxies , providing a smooth distribution in luminosity between the extremely luminous high - redshift galaxies and more ordinary local dusty galaxies .",
    "these fainter smgs at moderate and high redshifts will be hard to detect at submillimeter wavelengths prior to the commissioning of alma .",
    "high - redshift dusty galaxies with fainter 850-@xmath3 m flux densities may have luminosities similar to those of known smgs , but higher temperatures .",
    "these would be an important class of objects , both very luminous and hotter than any population detected so far ( fig.1 ) .",
    "the _ iras _",
    "survey is not deep enough to find such galaxies ( stanford et al .  2000 ) , and small _ iso _ samples do not appear to detect them in large numbers ( garrett et al .",
    "2001 ; franceschini et al .",
    "the deepest _ iso _ 15-@xmath3 m images ( altieri et al .",
    "1999 ; metcalfe et al .",
    "2003 ) may include some examples , but redshifts , and supporting deep submillimeter and radio data are not common for this population .    with @xmath42k and @xmath37 such hot galaxies at @xmath433",
    "could be detected in current deep radio surveys ( fig.2 ) , but not in existing submillimeter surveys . a factor of 10 increase in submillimeter sensitivity is required to probe this region of the @xmath9@xmath8 diagram . because confusion noise sets the 850-@xmath3 m sensitivity limit at about 2mjy in field galaxy surveys using current telescopes ( blain et al .",
    "2002 ) , higher angular resolution or a large gravitational lensing magnification , not just longer integrations , would be necessary .",
    "optical spectra taken in parallel to chapman et al.s smg redshift survey have provided redshifts for many optically faint galaxies that have weak radio detections but no submillimeter emission ( chapman et al .",
    "these galaxies optical spectral properties are similar to those of high - redshift smgs , without signs of powerful agn , so it is plausible to suggest that their radio emission is produced by star formation .",
    "these optically faint galaxies are excellent candidates for a hotter , high - redshift , dust - enshrouded galaxy population , which can not be detected in submillimeter surveys owing to the galaxies high dust temperatures .",
    "the surface densities of these galaxies are comparable to those of the smgs , so a survey covering just a few tenths of a square degree should find a statistical sample of several tens .",
    "such a population of galaxies would generate background radiation intensity in addition to that from the known smgs and their fainter counterparts .",
    "the extra intensity that they contribute would mostly increase the background intensity at wavelengths shorter than about 200@xmath3 m , where the background reported by schlegel , finkbeiner & davis ( 1998 ) is underpredicted both by models of the evolution of smgs ( blain et al .   1999 , 2002 ) , and by summing over the flux and surface densities reported for smgs and their fainter dusty counterparts .",
    "possible sources of 200-@xmath3 m background radiation are discussed by blain & phillips ( 2002 ) : a 50% increase in the intensity of background radiation above that accounted for by extrapolating the known smg population is possible at about 100@xmath3 m , and could be due to a hotter high - redshift population of dusty galaxies .",
    "the known selection effects for existing submillimeter and far - ir surveys , observational hints at a spectroscopically similar , but submillimeter - faint , population of high - redshift radio source , and the intensity of the 100200-@xmath3 m extragalactic background radiation , are all consistent with the existence of a proposed population of hot high - redshift dusty galaxies .",
    "to be certain that we have revealed this population it is necessary to probe deeper into the luminosity function of dusty galaxies at high redshifts , an opportunity that is available most easily at shorter mid - ir wavelengths .",
    "the recently launched _ spitzer _ offers excellent sensitivity and an unprecedentedly large field of view at mid and far - ir wavelengths .",
    "while it is still not absolutely clear how deep _ spitzer _ can integrate before being limited by confusion noise , it will certainly produce much better images of the far - ir sky than any previous mission .",
    "fig.4 shows the region of the @xmath9@xmath8 plane that _ spitzer _ will probe to the estimated confusion limits ( blain et al.2002 ) at various wavelengths .",
    "deep _ spitzer _",
    "observations can thus investigate the whole of the unprobed region of the @xmath9@xmath8 plane near 60k and @xmath4 at 24-@xmath3 m . in the unlikely event that a source confusion limit brighter than 0.1mjy prevents _ spitzer _ from reaching this depth ,",
    "then the larger 2.5-m aperture sofia airborne observatory will certainly be able to probe this region of the @xmath9@xmath8 plane in very long exposures .",
    "the 24-@xmath3 m flux density expected for a distant galaxy as a function of @xmath8 and @xmath9 depends most strongly on the value of the @xmath29 parameter that describes the mid - ir sed .",
    "however , increasing or decreasing @xmath29 by 0.5 leads to less than a factor of two change in the predicted far - ir luminosity at 24-@xmath3 m expected from a galaxy at redshift @xmath44 for @xmath45k .",
    "if an extreme value of @xmath27 ( representative of the steepest known mid - ir sed in arp220 ) is assumed , then only galaxy luminosities that are a factor of 5 times higher than the limits shown in fig.4 can be probed using a 24-@xmath3 m observation to a certain flux density limit .",
    "hence , even for the most extreme sed , a _ spitzer _",
    "24-@xmath3 m survey can still access the unexplored region of the @xmath9@xmath8 parameter space highlighted in fig.4 for galaxies at @xmath24 .    at wavelengths",
    "longer than about 100@xmath3 m , confusion noise from faint undetected galaxies makes it difficult to probe the unexplored region at high redshifts unless the telescope used has an aperture greater than of order 3-m .",
    "hence , to sample the full range of known high - redshift galaxy seds near their restframe emission peak will require a next - generation 10-m - class far - ir telescope , such as the nasa _ safir _ vision mission .",
    "its sensitivity to less - luminous and hotter galaxies at lower redshifts will also ensure that _ spitzer _ can be used to reveal whether the absence of low - luminosity , hot , relatively low - redshift galaxies in fig.4 reflects a real upper limit to the luminosity - weighted dust temperature in galaxies , or whether it is a selection effect brought about by insufficient sensitivity in existing surveys .",
    "note that because the line defining the 24-@xmath3 m selection condition is predicted to be orthogonal to the track of the existing data points through fig.4 , _ spitzer _ observations will be sensitive to any high - redshift galaxies with luminosities in the range @xmath46@xmath1 , and temperatures @xmath47k .",
    "hence , they could readily test whether the upper temperature limit to the seds in existing samples is a real astrophysical result or a selection effect .",
    "a further benefit of the great sensitivity of _ spitzer _ is its ability to detect any luminous galaxies that lie on the cold side of the smg track in fig.4 ( e.g. chapman et al .",
    "the details of the detectability of cooler galaxies at the short rest wavelength of 24@xmath3 m are uncertain , and will remain so until the release of the first _ spitzer _ data in mid-2004 .",
    "although such cold luminous galaxies should be detectable in existing submillimeter surveys , the much larger sky area that should be covered by _",
    " of the order of 100deg@xmath48 as compared with the 0.51deg@xmath48 covered by all existing deep mm and submillimeter - wave surveys  will yield a larger number of potential examples .",
    "images of smg fields will also provide a direct test of the seds assumed for the smgs based on the far - ir  radio correlation when placing the smgs on the @xmath9@xmath8 plane in fig.1 , and thus will test the evolution of this correlation .",
    "note that to identify the most interesting sources among the huge crop of _ spitzer _ detections , deep radio and submillimeter data will still be very valuable , to provide accurate positions and sed / temperature limits respectively .",
    "if _ spitzer _ detects faint high - redshift @xmath3jy radio galaxies and confirms that they lie in the unexplored region of the @xmath9@xmath8 plane ( fig.4 ) , then we will have a full measure of the scatter in the seds / temperatures of high - redshift luminous dusty galaxies .",
    "if not , then we will have found a new population of distant radio - selected galaxies without obvious agn signatures ( chapman et al .",
    "2004b ; alexander et al",

    "these galaxies would have to lie on the radio - loud side of the low - redshift radio  far - ir correlation .",
    "this new class of galaxies could be either x - ray and optically faint , dust - enshrouded , compton - thick agns , or distant star - forming galaxies with anomalously powerful radio emission , which are found only at the 1% level in low - redshift samples ( yun et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "c +    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     c +",
    "the recent acquisition of a large sample of smg redshifts provides the opportunity to constrain the seds of the most luminous ( @xmath49 ) high - redshift galaxies .",
    "it is now reasonably certain that the typical high - redshift smgs selected at 850-@xmath3 m are systematically cooler than local dusty galaxies of comparable luminosity , and are thus without direct low - redshift analogs .",

    "<S> the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of dust - enshrouded galaxies with powerful restframe far - infrared(ir ) emission have been constrained by a range of ground - based and space - borne surveys . </S>",

    "<S> iras _ catalog provides a reasonably complete picture of the dust emission from nearby galaxies ( redshift @xmath0 ) that are typically less luminous than about @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> however , at higher redshifts , the observational coverage from all existing far - ir and submillimeter surveys is much less complete . </S>",
    "<S> here we investigate the seds of a new sample of high - redshift submillimeter - selected galaxies ( smgs ) , for which redshifts are known , allowing us to estimate reliable luminosities and characteristic dust temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that a wide range of seds is present in the population , and that a substantial number of luminous dusty galaxies with hotter dust temperatures could exist at similar redshifts ( @xmath2 ) , but remain undetected in existing submillimeter surveys </S>",
    "<S> . these hotter galaxies could be responsible for about a third of the extragalactic ir background radiation at a wavelength of about 100@xmath3 m . </S>",
    "<S> the brightest of these galaxies would have far - ir luminosities of the order of @xmath4 and dust temperatures of the order of 60k . </S>",
    "<S> galaxies up to an order of magnitude less luminous with similar seds will be easy to detect and identify in the deepest _ spitzer space telescope _ </S>",
