    "with newtonian dynamics , computer simulations of particle systems play an important role in condensed matter physics , biophysics , chemical physics , space physics , and astrophysics . due to the extremely large number of particles , periodic boundary conditions ( pbcs )",
    "are often employed .",
    "so the whole system is treated as a crystal composed of periodic cells , i.e. , from the condensed matter physics point of view .",
    "since the pbcs are imaginary conditions , are we allowed to choose the periods or the cell edge vectors arbitrarily , even for free systems at low temperature ?",
    "we know that there is a great variety of period values in real crystals .",
    "so pbcs are acceptable in some sense .",
    "but crystal periods are not arbitrary",
    ". neither should be the periods in pbcs .",
    "the crystal periods are also called lattice constants , which are not changing in low temperature equilibrium states , under given constant external forces or pressure ( normal force per unit area ) or stress ( force per unit area ) , which act on the surfaces of crystals only . however",
    "if these external forces are subject to change , the periods will definitely change accordingly .",
    "in fact , the periods were already recognized as new degrees of freedom replacing those of the image particles previously@xcite .",
    "this is not difficult to understand .",
    "if the positions of all particles in one cell are determined , those of particles in other cells are also determined if and only if the periods are determined .",
    "so we need to develope dynamical equations for the periods with consideration of external stress , rather than assigning some estimated fixed values to them .",
    "another related problem is how external forces affect internal particles .",
    "if the periods are affected by the external forces acting on particles at the boundaries , as most of the internal particles positions are also determined by the periods , the external forces eventually affect the internal particles behavior .    as molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation @xcite can be used to simulate all of the above processes in various fields of physics , let us use the md terminology in the following .",
    "the center cell is called `` md  cell '' , and the particles in the md cell are called `` md particles '' .",
    "the first periodic dynamical equation was the one for cell volume proposed by andersen in 1980@xcite in his simulation of fluids subjected to a constant external pressure .",
    "shortly thereafter , parrinello and rahman extended andersen s idea to a new md theory ( prmd ) , in which the dynamical equations for the complete periods were proposed for constant external pressure and constant general external stress respectively@xcite .",
    "since then , many phase transition simulations on crystal structures induced by external forces have been carried out@xcite , especially after it was combined with the well - known car - parrinello md@xcite .",
    "later , some various versions of the prmd were also proposed@xcite .",
    "however one problem in these works is the violation of newton s second law@xcite .",
    "they all use the scaled particle position vectors @xmath0 @xmath1 defined in @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the md particle @xmath4 s position vector , @xmath5 * , * @xmath6 and *  * @xmath7 are the cell edge ( period ) vectors ( forming a right - handed triad ) , and @xmath8 _  _ is the matrix formed by @xmath9 , as generalized coordinates . by taking @xmath10 , rather than @xmath11 , as kinetic energy of particle @xmath4 with mass @xmath12 in the lagrangian of the md  cell and applying the lagrangian dynamics",
    ", they obtained dynamical equations for both the md particles and the periods .",
    "although these deduction can lead to the generally believed kinetic - energy term of the internal stress and interaction term of the internal stress , unfortunately , the generated dynamical equations for the md particles from the incomplete kinetic energy violate newton s second law@xcite .",
    "if the complete particle kinetic energy were used in the lagrangian of their works , the kinetic - energy term of the internal stress would have not been generated in physics , as in our previous works@xcite .    as a matter of fact , using @xmath13 , rather than @xmath3 , as generalized coordinates , can not simplify but complicate the formula , and is unnecessary to couple the particle positions and the periods@xcite .",
    "the particle positions and the periods are coupled when particles of more than one cell are considered .",
    "this paper adopts the md particle positions and the periods , the natural and complete degrees of freedom , as independent dynamical variables .",
    "as external forces act on particles in surfaces directly only , it is usually difficult to present a clear physics picture for their action in a lagrangian of the md cell . so in this paper",
    ", we will apply newton s second law to halves of the macroscopic crystals to get dynamical equations for periods , with explicit action of the external forces on the surfaces of the crystals , and keep newton s second law for the md particles in the original form to avoid the above violation problem . by also considering the external forces involved in collisions between infinitely far away walls and particles near the walls and introducing an additional `` force '' accompanying pure transport of momentum ,",
    "the controversial@xcite kinetic - energy term of the internal stress is found in this paper .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the model and basic ideas are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] .",
    "the simplest case of low temperature without collisions is discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : lowt ] , then a new statistical explanation of the interaction term is reported in sec .",
    "[ sec : interaction ] .",
    "the collision between particles and walls is discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : collision ] , which results in the kinetic - energy term of the internal stress eventually .",
    "a further discussion on the kinetic - energy term is presented , in which the additional `` force '' in pure transport of momentum is introduced , in sec . [",

    "calculated cobalt structures under constant stress is shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : example ] , and sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] is devoted to a summary .",
    "the macroscopic bulk of a material with a periodic structure expressed by @xmath14 is taken as the model for the study .",
    "for simplicity , let us suppose that it consists of complete cells only , denoted by the corresponding lattice translation vectors @xmath15 @xmath16 with @xmath17 , *  * @xmath18,@xmath19and @xmath20 integers , and @xmath21 for the md cell .",
    "we study the properties of the inner part of the bulk around the center , from which the surface can be regarded infinitely far away , and only averaged surface effects affect the inner part .",
    "the external action on its surface is expressed by the constant external stress tensor ( or dyad ) @xmath22 .",
    "it can be divided into two parts .",
    "one is the collision interaction between particles and walls surrounding the bulk , denoted by the stress tensor @xmath23 , and the other is the rest external interaction , denoted by the stress tensor @xmath24 .",
    "the former is particle - velocity related and usually not significant at low temperatures .",
    "the following section will address the case with the latter considered only .",
    "later , the whole external interaction @xmath25 will be dealt with .    by definition ,",
    "the external force acting on an infinitesimal surface area vector @xmath26 of the bulk is @xmath27 here , the direction of @xmath26 is from inside to the outside of the bulk .",
    "the net external force on the bulk is @xmath28 i.e. , there is no acceleration for the mass center of the bulk .",
    "let us set the center of mass at a fixed position .",
    "usually , the external stress @xmath29 is assumed to be symmetric , i.e. , for all of its components @xmath30 .",
    "this stress symmetry ensures that the net external torque on the bulk is zero .",
    "this can easily be seen in a case of a cuboid , whose six surfaces are in the directions of the unit axes @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 of a cartesian coordinate system with a volume @xmath34 .",
    "then the total torque in the @xmath35 direction is @xmath36 for @xmath37 acting on the six surfaces of the cuboid .",
    "we further assume that the bulk does not rotate either . however , under the constant external stress @xmath22 , the macroscopic volume and shape of the bulk may change , or the bulk may expand or contract with time , as it may not be in a static equilibrium state .",
    "of course , the microscopic positions of the md particles and the volume @xmath38 and shape of the md cell also change correspondingly .",
    "the dynamics for the md particles is well known .",
    "let us repeat newton s second law for these particles : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the number of particles in each cell and @xmath41 is the net force acting on md particle @xmath4 from all other particles without external force , which does not act on the md particles directly .",
    "the corresponding equilibrium condition for these degrees of freedom is @xmath42    simplifying further , we only discuss pair potentials @xmath43 .",
    "the extension to many - body interactions is straightforward by examining our previous work@xcite .",
    "it is easy to deduce that @xmath44 with the help of newton s third law for interactions between particles , and the periodicity of the crystal .",
    "for the bulk , the periods @xmath8 are the only left degrees of freedom . in order to find dynamical equations for them",

    "the data are reproduced for the constant pressure of @xmath196 atm .",
    "then an additional pressure of @xmath197 atms is applied along the negative @xmath195-axis direction onto the top surface of case 1 , and the results are shown as case 2 .",
    "we see that the structure is still hcp , but with @xmath198 much decreased and @xmath199 @xmath200 significantly increased due to the strong pressure along the @xmath195-axis direction",
    ". further additional stress components of @xmath201 atms are applied to case 2 , shown as case 3 . as a result ,",
    "the structure is no longer exactly hcp : @xmath202 , and @xmath7 is perpendicular neither to @xmath191 nor to @xmath6 .",
    "however the structure still shows some features resembling hcp .",
    "so we have changed the cobalt s structure by applying external forces or stress .",
    "by keeping newton s second law for md particles and applying it to macroscopic half systems , we arrived at a group of coupled dynamical equations ( eqs .",
    "( [ b03 ] ) and ( [ c09 ] ) ) for periodic systems under constant external stress .",
    "they clearly show that the periods change dynamically and that the external forces also influence the motion of md particles .",
    "our dynamical equations also show that the system is driven by the imbalance between the internal and external stress .",
    "the internal stress also takes the summation form of the interaction term and the kinetic - energy term .",
    "we further developed the interaction term into the main interaction term ( eq .",
    "( [ b10.0 ] ) ) and the rest ( eq .",
    "( [ i04.2 ] ) ) .",
    "the former , reflecting the main interactions between the two halves of the system , can be easily extended to cases of more accurate forces beyond pair potentials .",
    "the latter , taking a fixed form in all cases , reflects the statistics of different choices of the system .",
    "the controversial kinetic - energy term was obtained with the statistics of the collisions between particles and walls , and that of the additional `` force '' in the pure transport of momentum applied .    from the dynamical equations ,",
    "it is easy to see that even for low temperature equilibrium problems , the periods can not be assigned fixed values arbitrarily .",
    "actually , the periods and md particle positions must be configured such that both eq .",
    "( [ b03.2 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ b18 ] ) are satisfied . as the external stress @xmath203 is symmetric , @xmath204 should also be symmetric . for systems with estimated periods , eq .",
    "( [ b18 ] ) can be used to calculate the external stress @xmath24 needed to keep them in equilibrium states . for free systems ,",
    "the calculated external stress must be zero . also from the dynamical equations",
