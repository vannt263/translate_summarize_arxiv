    "but this is not the only bone of contention :    one of the approximations used in the theory of ordinary or muonic hydrogen involves the lepton s wave function at the origin .",
    "the approximation is sufficiently good for the former atom , but not the latter",
    ". the required correction can be rephrased by having an @xmath7 that runs , in the same sense as @xmath8 the fine structure constant of qcd does .",
    "the modification results in a @xmath9 shift of the extracted central value of @xmath7 , in the direction of reducing the  tension \" between experimental results .",
    "this correction depends on the model of the proton s charge distribution , but the model - dependence is a small correction to a moderate correction . these issues are discussed in detail in sections iii and iv .    the current way to extract @xmath7 from @xmath0 scattering data involves an extrapolation to a momentum transfer @xmath10 , the point from which @xmath11 is inferred .",
    "this extrapolation covers a two - orders of magnitude larger hiatus than the one relevant to muonic hydrogen ; the model - dependence is correspondingly larger .",

    "the extraction of @xmath7 from @xmath0 data has severe statistical problems , mentioned in the abstract and discussed in section v. one way to reappraise this issue is to take new , very precise data @xcite , see also section v. the difficulties associated with these analyses are shared by the measurement of the other relevant quantity : the  third zemach moment \" , as discussed in section vi and vii .",
