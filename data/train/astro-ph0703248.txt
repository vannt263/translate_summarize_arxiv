    "h@xmath0 is the most abundant molecule in the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",

    "it is widely accepted that h@xmath0 formation in the ism takes place on dust grains @xcite . in this process , h atoms that collide with a grain and adsorb on its surface quickly equilibrate and diffuse either by thermal activation or tunneling . they may encounter each other and form h@xmath0 molecules @xcite , or desorb thermally in atomic form .    in recent years",
    ", we have conducted a series of experiments on the formation of molecular hydrogen on dust grain analogues such as polycrystalline silicates @xcite , amorphous carbon @xcite and amorphous water ice @xcite , under astrophysically relevant conditions . in these experiments ,",
    "the surface was irradiated by beams of h and d atoms .",
    "the production of hd molecules was measured during the irradiation and during a subsequent temperature programmed desorption ( tpd ) experiment . to disentangle the process of diffusion from the one of desorption ,",
    "separate experiments were carried out in which molecular species were irradiated on the sample and were later induced to desorb .",
    "related studies were done on amorphous ice surfaces @xcite .",

    "the conditions for efficient h@xmath0 formation on different astrophysically relevant surfaces were found . in particular , the formation of h@xmath0 on polycrystalline silicates was found to be efficient only in a narrow temperature window below 10k . since the typical dust grain temperature in diffuse interstellar clouds is higher than 10k , these results indicated that polycrystalline silicate grains can not be efficient catalysts for h@xmath0 formation in most diffuse clouds .    in this _ letter _",
    "we present , for the first time , experiments on molecular hydrogen formation on _ amorphous _ silicates and analyze the results using a suitable rate equation model @xcite . using the parameters that best fit the experimental results ,",
    "the efficiency of hydrogen recombination on grains is obtained for a range of conditions pertinent to diffuse interstellar clouds .",
    "it is found that unlike the polycrystalline silicate grains , amorphous silicate grains , which are the main silicate component in interstellar clouds @xcite , are efficient catalysts for h@xmath0 formation within a broad temperature window that extends at least up to about 14k .",
    "the apparatus consists of an ultra - high vacuum chamber housing the sample holder and a detector .",
    "the sample can be cooled by liquid helium to @xmath15k , as measured by a calibrated silicon diode and thermocouple placed in the back of the sample .",

    "hydrogen and deuterium gases are dissociated in two radio - frequency dissociation sources , with dissociation efficiency of 80 - 90% , and are sent into the sample chamber via two triple differentially pumped beam lines @xcite .    in the experiments reported here , we used beams of low fluxes and short dosing times . using the standard langmuir - hinshelwood analysis , plotting the total yield of hd vs. the exposure time @xcite",
    ", we estimated the coverage to be a small fraction ( a few percent ) of a monolayer ( ml ) .",

    "next , after dosing is completed , in a tpd experiment , the surface temperature is raised rapidly and the rate of hd desorption is measured ( the _ tpd phase _ ) . by far , the main contribution comes from the tpd phase .    irradiations with beams of h and d (  \" h+d  \" thereafter ) were done on an amorphous silicate surface in order to explore the formation processes of hd molecules .",

    "the results of current experiments of h+d irradiation on amorphous silicates , clearly differ from those of earlier experiments on polycrystalline silicates .",
    "the desorption curves from amorphous silicates contain two wide peaks , located at a significantly higher temperatures than the single narrow peak obtained for the polycrystalline silicate .",
    "the higher peak temperatures indicate that the relevant energy barriers are larger , while their large width reflects a broader distribution of the energy barriers of the hd desorption sites .",
    "the tpd curve of hd desorption from amorphous silicates , after irradiation with hd molecules ( crosses in fig .",
    "1 ) , is qualitatively similar to the curve obtained for h+d irradiation .",
    "in particular , the peak temperatures are the same .",
    "the relative weights of the high temperature peaks vs. the low temperature peaks are somewhat different .",
    "also , in similar experiments with higher values of @xmath11 , a third peak was observed at higher temperatures .",
    "we attribute this behavior to diffusion of hd molecules , which gradually migrate from shallow into deep adsorption sites @xcite .    in fig .",
    "2 we present a series of tpd curves for hd desorption after irradiation with h+d atoms on an amorphous silicate surface with different irradiation times . each curve exhibits a large peak at a lower temperature and a broader peak ( or a shoulder ) at a higher temperature .",
    "the position of the high temperature peak is found to be independent of the irradiation time , indicating that this peak exhibits first order kinetics .",
    "the low temperature peak shifts to the right as the irradiation time is reduced . since in the low - coverage regime",
    "studied here , the activation energies and the pre - exponential factor are not expected to depend on the coverage , these results indicate that the low temperature peak exhibits second order kinetics .",
    "this is unlike the case of irradiation with hd molecules , where the lower - temperature peak does not shift , showing first order kinetics .",
    "in the model used here , there is no distinction between the h and d atoms , namely the same diffusion and desorption barriers are used for both isotopes .",
    "hydrogen atoms that stick to the surface hop as random walkers and may either encounter each other and form molecules , or desorb from the surface . as the sample temperature",
    "is raised , both the diffusion and desorption rates quickly increase .",
    "if a large fraction of the energy released when two h atoms recombine is transformed into kinetic energy of the formed molecule , it would immediately desorb from the grain surface in a high ro - vibrational state , and with large translational energy . however , both our experiments on ice @xcite and the current experiments indicate that such prompt desorption does not occur on amorphous surfaces [ but see perry and price ( 2003 ) , tine et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and creighan et al .",
    "( 2006 ) for other , more ordered , surfaces ] . instead , the newly formed molecules dissipate their energy , probably through multiple collisions with the rough surface or internal pores .",
    "these molecules thermalize with the surface and become trapped in adsorption sites before they thermally desorb .",
    "consequently , the desorbed molecules are not highly excited , and desorb only with a thermal energy comparable with the grain surface temperature .",
    "therefore , in our model it is assumed that the newly formed molecules do not promptly desorb , but are trapped in adsorption sites with a range of potential barriers .",
    "the experimental results were fitted using the rate equation model described in perets et al .",
    "the parameters for the diffusion and desorption of hydrogen atoms and molecules on the amorphous silicate surface were obtained .",
    "these include the energy barrier @xmath12 for the diffusion of h atoms and the barrier @xmath13 for their desorption .",
    "the value obtained for the desorption barrier should be considered only as a lower bound , because the tpd results are insensitive to variations in @xmath13 , as long as it is higher than the reported value .",
    "the desorption barriers of hd molecules adsorbed in shallow ( lower temperature peak ) and deep ( higher temperature peak ) sites , are given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 , 2 , respectively .",
    "the rate equation model is integrated using a runge - kutta stepper . for",
    "any given choice of the parameters , one obtains a set of tpd curves for the different irradiation times used in the experiments .",
    "the actual temperature curve of the sample , recorded during the experiment , is used in the analysis ( see inset in fig .",
    "2 ) . in the first step ,",
    "the barriers @xmath16 , @xmath15 , 2 , for the desorption of molecules are obtained using the results of the experiments in which hd molecules are irradiated on the surface . to obtain better fits",
    ", we incorporate suitable gaussian distributions of energy barriers around these two values . in the second step ,",
    "the barriers for diffusion and desorption of h atoms are obtained , using the model to fit the results of h+d irradiation experiments ( table 1 ) .    .",
    "energy barriers for diffusion and desorption . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ t : e_barriers ]    the second order behavior of the low temperature peak in the h+d irradiation experiments can be explained as follows .",
    "most hd molecules are formed only when the surface temperature is sufficiently high to enable significant mobility of h and d atoms . at this temperature , the shallow adsorption sites can not retain the newly formed molecules adsorbed in these sites , which quickly desorb from the surface by thermal activation . however , those newly formed molecules which are trapped in deeper sites do not desorb yet , and remain on the surface until its temperature increases further . thus , the high temperature peak exhibits first order kinetics and is located at the same temperatures in both hd and h+d irradiation experiments .",
    "note that we can not exclude the possibility that some fraction of the molecules desorbed in the high temperature peak are formed during irradiation and remain trapped in deep adsorption sites until the temperature becomes sufficiently high for them to desorb .    at longer h+d irradiation times",
    ", more atoms are adsorbed on the surface , and they find each other more easily .",
    "the low temperature peak ( corresponding to hd desorption from shallower sites ) shifts to lower temperatures with longer irradation times , thus showing second order behavior .",
    "this behavior must saturate with even longer irradiation times , when the temperature needed for hd formation becomes lower than the temperature needed for thermal desorption from the shallower hd adsorption sites .",
    "the hd molecules then form at low temperatures , but are trapped in the shallow sites .",
    "they then await until the temperature is further increased , much like the adsorbed hd molecules in the hd irradiation experiments .",
    "therfore , at longer irradiation times the low temperature peak should saturate into first - order like behavior and the tpd curves of the h+d and hd irradiation experiments should become more similar .",
    "this behavior is confirmed by the tpd curves for h+d and hd irradiation shown in fig . 1 .    using the parameters obtained from the experiments we now calculate the recombination efficiency of hydrogen on amorphous silicate surfaces under interstellar conditions",
    "the recombination efficiency is defined as the fraction of hydrogen atoms adsorbed on the surface which come out as molecules . in fig .",
    "3 we present the recombination efficiency vs. surface temperature for the amorphous silicate sample under flux of 5.2 @xmath17 @xmath18 ( ml s@xmath19 ) .",
    "this flux is within the typical range for diffuse interstellar clouds , where bare amorphous silicate grains are expected to play a crucial role in h@xmath20 formation .",
    "this flux corresponds to gas density of 10 ( atoms @xmath21 ) , gas temperature of 100k and density of @xmath22 adsorption sites per @xmath23 on the surface , obtained using the procedure described in biham et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .",
    "a window of high recombination efficiency is found between 8 - 13k , compared to 6 - 10k for polycrystalline silicate under similar conditions . for gas density of 100 ( atoms @xmath24 ) , the high efficiency window for the amorphous silicates surface shifts to 9 - 14k .",
    "at higher temperatures atoms desorb from the surface before they have sufficient time to encounter each other . at lower temperatures diffusion",
    "is suppressed and the langmuir - hinshelwood mechanism is no longer efficient .",
    "saturation of the surface with immobile h atoms might render the eley - rideal mechanism more efficient in producing some recombination @xcite .",
    "our results thus indicate that recombination efficiency of hydrogen on amorphous silicates is high in this temperature range , which is relevant to interstellar clouds . therefore",
    ", amorphous silicates seem to be good candidates for interstellar grain components on which hydrogen recombines with high efficiency .",
    "the analysis of the tpd curves from amorphous silicate surfaces shows that the relevant energy barriers on these surfaces are significantly higher than on polycrystalline silicates @xcite .",
    "a similar trend was observed in amorphous and porous ice surfaces @xcite .",
    "these results confirm the effect of surface morphology on the distribution of energy barriers .",
    "this effect can be parameterized using a model that provides a quantitative connection between the roughness and the energy barriers @xcite .",
    "our results are consistent with this model and can be used to quantitatively constrain its parameters .",
    "more specifically , we find a 1.4 - 1.5 times increase in the energy barriers of the amorphous silicate vs. the polycrystalline silicate surface .",
    "this gives rise to shifting and broadening of the temperature window in which h@xmath20 formation is efficient , by a similar factor . scanning electron microscope images show that the morphology of the amorphous silicate samples is very rough ( h. cuppen , private communication ) .",
    "these samples are made of a broad ( log - normal like ) distribution of spheres and agglomerates , from several nanometers up to a micron size .",
    "it is safe to conclude that our present results , together with those on amorphous carbon @xcite , show that amorphous silicate and carbon grains are efficient catalysts for the formation of molecular hydrogen in diffuse clouds .",
    "however , the results indicate that surface roughness is unlikely to extend the window of efficient recombination to temperatures of the order of 30 - 50k observed in photo - dissociation regions ( pdrs ) .",
    "we thus conclude that surface roughness , by itself , does not explain the high abundance of h@xmath0 in pdrs .    in the model used here",
    ", it is assumed that h@xmath0 molecules do not desorb immediately upon formation .",
    "instead , they stay trapped in the adsorption sites or hop between them until thermal desorption takes place . consequently , one needs to consider mechanisms for the dissipation of the excess energy acquired from the recombination process in order to prevent prompt desorption . for amorphous , porous ice surfaces it was shown , using time of flight ( tof ) measurements , that the kinetic energy of the desorbed molecules is small ( @xmath253 mev ) , namely the excess energy is absorbed by the surface @xcite .",
    "although we do not have direct measurements of the tof of the hd molecules desorped from the amorphous silicate surface , the similarity between the tpd curves obtained after hd and h+d irradiations indicates that newly formed hd molecules reside and then desorb from the same adsorption sites as hd molecules irradiated on the surface . in light of the results on both ice and amorphous silicates , it is likely than h@xmath0 molecules formed on realistic interstellar dust would have low kinetic energy and would probably not occupy excited vibrational or rotational states .    in summary , we have analyzed a set of tpd experiments on molecular hydrogen formation and desorption from amorphous silicate surfaces under conditions relevant to interstellar clouds .",
    "fitting the tpd curves by rate equation models , the essential parameters of h@xmath0 formation on amorphous silicate surfaces were obtained .",
    "these parameters include the energy barrier for diffusion of h atoms as well as their barrier for desorption ( considered as a lower bound ) .",
    "the distribution of barriers for desorption of h@xmath20 molecules is also obtained .",
    "interestingly , a single type of adsorption site for hydrogen atoms is identified , vs. two types of sites for molecules .",
    "the fraction of the adsorption sites , which belong to each of the two types is also evaluated .",
    "the rate equation model provides a unified description of several first and second order processes .",
    "it enables us to extrapolate the production rate of h@xmath0 molecules from laboratory conditions to astrophysical conditions .",
    "it thus provides a quantitative evaluation of the efficiency of amorphous silicate surfaces as catalysts in the formation of h@xmath0 molecules in interstellar clouds .",
    "we find that the recombination efficiency strongly depends on the surface temperature .",
    "in particular , the amorphous silicate sample studied here exhibits high efficiency within a range of surface temperatures which is relevant to diffuse interstellar clouds .",
    "the comparison of the current results with earlier ones on polycrystalline silicate surfaces shows the importance of surface morphology in molecular hydrogen formation .",
    "the results are in agreement with theoretical predictions on the effects of surface roughness @xcite .",
    "the results also indicate that on amorphous surfaces , newly formed h@xmath0 molecules are thermalized on the surface and do not promptly desorb .",
    "consequently , h@xmath0 molecules formed on and desorbed from realistic _ amorphous _",
    "interstellar dust are expected to have very low kinetic energy and would probably not occupy excited vibrational or rotational states .",
