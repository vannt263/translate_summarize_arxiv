    "equivalence relations partition their domains into classes of equivalent objects  objects indistinguishable with respect to some characteristic . in the case of domains",
    "whose elements can be combined , equivalence relations can be _",
    "strengthened_. in this paper , we introduce the concept of strengthening , motivate it , and study it in the case of equivalence relations that arise in the domain of graphs .    to illustrate what we have in mind ,",
    "let us consider a set @xmath16 of possible team members .",
    "teams are finite subsets of @xmath16 .",
    "we have some equivalence relation on the set of teams , which groups in its equivalence classes teams of the same value .",
    "thus , given two equivalent teams , say @xmath17 , we could use any of them without compromising the quality .",
    "but there is more to it .",
    "let us consider a team @xmath18 , such that @xmath19 is its sub - team , that is , @xmath20 .",
    "let us also suppose that for one reason or another we are unable to keep all members of @xmath19 in @xmath18",
    ". if we need the `` functionality '' of @xmath19 in @xmath18 , we might want to replace @xmath19 with its equivalent @xmath21 by forming the team @xmath22 .",
    "after all , @xmath19 and @xmath21 are equivalent .",
    "but this is a reasonable solution only if by doing so , we do not change the quality of the overall team , that is , if @xmath18 and @xmath23 are equivalent , too . and",
    ", in general , it is not guaranteed .",
    "let us observe that in our example @xmath24 and @xmath25 , that is , they are extensions of @xmath19 and @xmath21 , respectively , with the same set , @xmath26 .",
    "this suggests that we might call teams @xmath19 and @xmath21 _ strongly equivalent _ ( with respect to the original equivalence relation ) if for every finite set @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are equivalent . clearly ,",
    "if @xmath19 and @xmath21 are strongly equivalent , then any two teams obtained by extending @xmath19 and @xmath21 with the same additional members are equivalent !",
    "thus , the relation of strong equivalence , the `` strengthening '' of the original one , is precisely what we need when we consider teams not as individual entities but as potential sub - teams in bigger groups .    to the best of our knowledge",
    ", the concept of strong equivalence has emerged so far only in the area of logic programming @xcite .",
    "researchers argued there that it underlies the notion of a module of a program , and is essential to modular program development . in this paper",
    "we study the strengthening of an equivalence relation in the domain of graphs . as a result",
    ", we obtain a new class of graph - theoretic problems .",
    "importantly , when applied to specific properties , for instance , to the graph connectivity , the notion of strengthening has interesting practical implication and does give rise to non - trivial arguments and characterizations .",
    "let us consider the following scenario . in the context of networks , which we typically represent as graphs ,",
    "the concept of their connectivity is of paramount importance ( cf .",
    "colbourn @xcite ) .",
    "let us define graphs @xmath10 and @xmath11 to be equivalent if both are @xmath13-connected or if neither of them is .",
    "with time networks grow and get embedded into bigger networks .",
    "the key question is : are the graphs @xmath10 and @xmath11 interchangeable , in the sense that the networks obtained by identical extensions of @xmath10 and @xmath11 are equivalent with respect to @xmath13-connectivity ?    for example , neither of the two graphs in figure [ mot](a ) is 2-connected and so , they are equivalent with respect to 2-connectivity .",
    "they are not , however , strongly equivalent with respect 2-connectivity .",
    "indeed , the graphs obtained by extending them with two edges @xmath30 and @xmath31 , shown in figure [ mot](b ) are not 2-connectivity equivalent  one of them is 2-connected and the other one is not ! on the other hand , one can verify directly from the definition that the graphs shown in figure [ mot](c ) are strongly equivalent with respect to 2-connectivity .",
    "later in the paper , we provide a characterization that allows us to decide the question of strong equivalence with respect to connectivity .        our paper is organized as follows . while most of our results concern strengthening of equivalence relations on graphs , we start by introducing the concept of the strengthening of an equivalence relation in a more general setting of the domain of finite subsets of a set .",
    "we derive there several basic properties of the notion , which we use later in the paper .",
    "in particular , for a class of equivalence relations defined in terms of properties of objects  such equivalence relations are of primary interest in our study  we characterize those relations that are equal to their strengthenings .",
    "the following sections are concerned with equivalence relations on graphs defined in terms of graph properties , a primary subject of interest to us .",
    "narrowing down the focus of our study to graphs allows us to obtain stronger and more interesting results .",
    "in particular , we characterize relations whose strengthening is the identity relation , and those whose strengthening defines one large equivalence class , with all other classes being singletons .",
    "we apply these general characterizations to obtain descriptions of strong equivalence with respect to several concrete graph - theoretic properties including possessing hamiltonian cycles and being planar .",
    "main results of the paper , are contained in the two sections that follow .",
    "they concern graph - theoretic properties , which do not fall under the scope of our general results .",
    "specifically , we deal there with vertex and edge colorings , and with @xmath13-connectivity .",
    "the characterizations we obtain are non - trivial and show that the idea of strengthening gives rise to challenging problems that often ( as in the case of strengthening equivalence with respect to @xmath13-connectivity ) have interesting motivation and are of potential practical interest .",
    "we fix an infinite countable set @xmath32 and denote by @xmath33 the set of finite subsets of @xmath32 .",
    "let @xmath1 be an equivalence relation on @xmath33 .",
    "we say that sets @xmath34 are _ strongly equivalent _ with respect to @xmath1 , denoted by @xmath3 , if for every set @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "we call @xmath2 the _ strengthening _ of @xmath1 .    while most of our results concern the case when @xmath32 is a set of edges over some infinite countable set of vertices @xmath37 , in this section we impose no structure on @xmath32 and prove several basic general properties of the concept of strong equivalence .",

    "as @xmath509 has only two equivalence classes and the strengthening of the total relation ( the only possible weakening of @xmath509 ) is also the total equivalence relation , @xmath509 is the weakest relation @xmath505 such that @xmath506 and @xmath508 are equal .",
