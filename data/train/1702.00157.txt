    "chemically peculiar ( cp ) variables are spread between late - b and early - f spectral types , and thus contain various stars with effective temperatures greater than 6,500 k @xcite .",
    "these variables are comprised mostly of ap and bp stars , which differ from other types having the same temperature by their abnormal chemical compositions and slow rotations .",
    "the reason for the peculiarity is an under - abundance of solar - like elements , as well as an overabundance of both metal and rare - earth elements across their surfaces @xcite .",
    "magnetic fields , radiative acceleration , and atomic diffusion determine the surface distribution of elements @xcite , and lead them to be present in the form of spots and rings on the surface . along with rotation , these non - uniformly distributed regions cause periodic variations in magnetic fields , line profile , and energy distribution , as well as in photometric brightness ( oblique - rotator model ) .",
    "the periods of these variations are generally between a day and a week .",
    "depending on the slow rotation , surface spot regions can remain stable for decades .",
    "such a situation enables remarkably accurate calculations of surface distribution , rotation period , and rotational breaking mechanisms .",
    "however , only very few of the cp stars discovered in our galaxy and others exhibit periodic variations , and less than one - tenth of these have been observed for scientific investigation . in order to study this type of stars , accurate observations are needed ( accuracy @xmath5 0.005 mag @xcite ) .",
    "the high - precision instruments of the _ stereo _ satellite are a quite suitable , space - based source , since seasonal and four - year _ stereo _ observations provide a precision of @xmath6 and @xmath7 mmag , respectively .",
    "the photometric variability of v473tau ( a0si , v = 7.26 mag ) was first detected by burke et al .",
    "@xcite . they calculated the period of this variation as around 1.39(2 ) days , but this period value produced a light curve ( lc ) with a scattered maximum .",
    "hence , rakosch and fiedler @xcite noted that their observations were more adaptable with a double period .",
    "subsequently , maitzen @xcite derived a rotation period of 2.7795(1 ) days , which was indeed twice that of previous values . as a result of the double period , two minima and maxima having different levels",
    "were formed in the lc ; this situation was explained in terms of the different chemical regions on the surface .",
    "most importantly , this was a significant case since a double wave structure was not a common condition among si stars .",
    "in a recent study , jerzykiewicz @xcite investigated rotation periods and found a value of 1.4068541(29 ) days in u , b , and v bands .",
    "however , he could not completely determine the origin of the variabilities as he was unable to conclude whether the star was an oblique rotator or a g - mode pulsator .",
    "the data were provided from the hi-1a instrument on - board the _ stereo - a _ satellite .",
    "the hi-1a is capable of observing background stars with the magnitude of @xmath8 or brighter for a maximum of 20 days and a useful stellar photometer which covers the region around the ecliptic ( 20% of the sky ) with the field of view of @xmath9 .",
    "the nominal exposure time of the camera is 40 seconds , and putting 30 exposures together on board , a 40-minute integrated cadence has been obtained to transmit for each hi-1 image @xcite .",
    "therefore , the nyquist frequency of the data is around 18  c  d@xmath2 .",
    "lcs mostly affected by solar activities were cleaned with a @xmath10 order polynomial fit .",
    "observation points greater than @xmath11 were clipped with a pipeline written in the interactive data language ( idl ) ( for a more detailed description of the data preparation , refer to sangaralingam & stevens @xcite and whittaket et al .",
    "the lc of v473tau presented a sinusoidal characteristic due to spot modulation on the stellar surface .",
    "therefore , all analyses were performed using the lomb - scargle ( ls ) algorithm since it is more sensitive to such variations . to determine a model of the sinusoidal lcs",
    ", the levenberg - marquardt optimization method was applied , and the best fit was obtained after 5000 iterations . after the derivation of the model lc , random gaussian noise with the mean of zero and the sigma value , which was determined from the cleaned curve , was produced and added to the model .",
    "this process was repeated 500 times .",
    "the most accurate frequencies and their uncertainties were assessed using the monte - carlo simulation algorithm .",
    "the results were compared to those derived from the phase dispersion minimization ( pdm ) method and period04 . to perform o - c calculations and to investigate period variabilities over years , the best extremum times were obtained from the seasonal lcs , and were put together with data from the literature .",

    "in this research , we obtained four consecutive years of data between 2007 and 2010 .",
    "as reported by other researchers , all the lcs had explicit periodicity .",
    "individual ls , pdm and period04 analyses of the seasonal curves showed a frequency at around 0.71 c  d@xmath2 ( table  [ tab : table1 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we detected the existence of another strong peak at approximately 1.40 c  d@xmath2 ( 0.71 days ) on the ls periodogram ( figure  [ fig : figure1 ] , top right ) .    combining the four - year data , the precise rotation period of the star ( 0.710818 c  d@xmath2 ) was determined with the help of the ls method , and the main lc was plotted based on this value ( figure  [ fig : figure1 ] , top left ) .",
    "accordingly , the folded lc was clearly formed by a maximum and a broad minimum .",
    "the maximum was quite strong and had a peaked top .",
    "moreover , there was a barely detectable bump in the middle of the minimum , which is probably the cause of the peak at 1.40 c  d@xmath2 on the ls periodogram .",
    "also , we produced a folded lc using the double _ stereo _ period since maitzen @xcite noted that his observations were compatible with the period value of 2.7795 days .",
    "we derived a relatively clean lc with two minima and maxima .",
    "however , since the consecutive structures appeared similar to each other , we assumed that the period value of 0.710818 c  d@xmath2 was the full rotation period .    to investigate a possible period variation ,",
    "the best maximum times of the seasonal lcs were derived ( hjd24554583.4049 , 24554922.4465 , 24555274.1565 , 24554241.5599 ) , and these values were combined with the epochs from the literature . the archival epochs given as jd",
    "were converted to hjd .",
    "based on figure  [ fig : figure1 ] ( bottom ) , we found out that the o - c diagram of the star exhibited a period decrease with the variation rate of around @xmath12 d  y@xmath2 or @xmath1 s  y@xmath2 ( parabolic line ) . with the help of the ls period and the _ stereo _ maximum time having the smallest error value , we determined the light elements as :    @xmath13    since this star was a single rotating variable , such a period decrease might most likely be explained by an acceleration in rotation after a magnetic braking .",
    "using the period and its variation rate , the acceleration time - scale of the star ( @xmath14 ) was determined as @xmath15 yr .",
    "we also found the main sequence lifetime of the star ( @xmath16 ) as @xmath17 yr ( table  2 ) .",

    "radius and rotational velocities were estimated from the ls period , temperature , and luminosity values .",
    "[ tab : table2 ]    the variation in period of v473tau ( @xmath20 in table  2 ) is 10 times greater than that of the most massive cp stars given by mikulasek et al . @xcite .",
    "in addition , its acceleration is nearly three orders of magnitude shorter than the main sequence lifetime .",
    "this , in turn , suggests that process of decrease in the period may be reversible .",
    "if so , the length of the cycle is roughly calculated as 92(11 ) yr ( estimated by @xmath33 ; @xcite ) .",
    "considering the fact that period variation processes may be reversible due to shorter acceleration time - scale than that of the main sequence lifetime , the rigid rotation hypothesis should be discarded and the differential rotation model should alternatively be discussed as expressed by stepien @xcite . if a differential rotation is indeed in question for this star , the acceleration in the rotation may be interpreted as a consequence of torsional oscillations produced by meridional circulations being in interaction with a magnetic field , and of rotational braking in outer layers caused by angular momentum loss via magnetically - confined stellar wind @xcite .",
