    "recently , a simple nucleon - nucleon interaction was proposed which is claimed both realistic and leading to a standing wave instability in symmetric nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "although , strictly speaking , symmetric nuclear matter is a purely speculative object , it served for years as a testing ground for nuclear many - body theories and new insights into its properties are of considerable interest . the hint that all these theories missed the spatial modulation of the nuclear matter density is provocative .",
    "when putting forward such claim , one has to make sure that the proposed interaction satisfies constraints imposed by our knowledge of nuclear physics .",
    "the interaction considered in @xcite reads @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the center - of - mass corrected average kinetic energy : @xmath5 in the latter equation , single - particle orbitals @xmath6 relevant for the hartree - fock ( hf ) treatment are explicitly introduced .",
    "the auxiliary constant @xmath7 , while the strength and range of attraction and the strength of contact repulsion are chosen as @xmath81690 mev @xmath9 , @xmath10 fm , @xmath11 mev @xcite .",
    "these parameters were intended to fit the binding energy and the equilibrium density of nuclear matter and the binding energy of alpha particle ( but see below ) . with these parameters ,",
    "the authors reported reasonable values of the compressibility modulus of nuclear matter and of binding energies of even - even @xmath12 nuclei .",
    "it is crucial to understand that , although the authors refer to the hf method when describing their calculations for finite nuclei @xcite , they performed in fact only a very restricted minimization .",
    "this restriction is evident in a very small harmonic oscillator basis that has been used .",
    "in addition , the exchange integrals were not calculated , but assumed to be a fraction of the direct terms , depending on the average kinetic energy .",
    "therefore , especially in view of quite important consequences claimed , an independent evaluation of the results of ref.@xcite is called for .",
    "in this short note we report the results of regular hf calculations with the interaction ( [ inter ] ) by which we determined binding energies of @xmath0he , @xmath1o and @xmath2ca nuclei .",
    "these binding energies are at variance with @xcite and the obtained matter and charge densities of @xmath1o and @xmath2ca are highly unusual .",
    "as the interaction ( [ inter ] ) is spin- and isospin independent one assumes the fourfold degeneracy of the hf orbitals for even - even @xmath12 nuclei of interest .",
    "there are @xmath13 independent orbitals and we sum over them to obtain density @xmath14 .",
    "neutron and proton densities are equal , @xmath15 , and the total density equals @xmath16 .",
    "similarly , the total average kinetic energy @xmath4 is quadruple of the sum of kinetic terms over independent orbitals .",
    "the hf energy reads @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the attractive part of ( [ inter ] ) . remembering about differentiation of @xmath4",
    ", we obtain from ( [ e ] ) a set of hf equations for the wave functions @xmath6 and single - particle energies @xmath19 @xmath20 where the effective mass is given by @xmath21 $ ] , with @xmath22 .",
    "the numerical solution for @xmath6 is straightforward , but tedious due to the exchange integrals . for spherically",
    "symmetric completely filled shells there is , however , a well known slater method @xcite to obtain the exact exchange potential . adapting this general argument to the attractive potential @xmath18 we can express the exchange potential acting on the wave function @xmath23 as @xmath24 where the subshell index @xmath25 in the summation runs over the occupied orbitals .",
    "the coefficients @xmath26 are given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 are legendre polynomials .",
    "the functions @xmath29 define the expansion of @xmath18 into spherical harmonics @xmath30 ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 are the spherical bessel functions of the imaginary argument , i.e. @xmath32 = @xmath33 , with @xmath34 the modified bessel function @xcite and @xmath35 .",
    "in order to have a check on the hf results we used two different schemes , one spherical , using decomposition ( [ expot ] ) , and the other three - dimensional .",
    "both use wave functions defined over a spatial mesh . the general three - dimensional scheme being more",
    "time - consuming practically restricts the mesh size to about 30 points in each direction in one octant of space .",
    "the spherical scheme allows radial meshes of 100 points or more and may easily produce accurate solutions .",
    "we consider magic @xmath0he , @xmath1o and @xmath2ca nuclei for which the spherically symmetric solutions are expected .",
    "the hf problem was solved by the imaginary - time evolution .",
    "the convergence is rather slow for density and single particle energies , especially for @xmath2ca .",
    "this is due to the buildup of central density peak which costs little energy in final stages of iteration .",
    "the three - dimensional scheme becomes impractical in this case but still its results tend to those of the spherical code .",
    "below , we report densities calculted with the faster spherical code on the mesh of 100 points .    as the starting wave functions we took the results of @xcite",
    ". therefore we could compare our initial energies and densities with those of @xcite .",
    "we obtain for @xmath0he the same energy as in @xcite , but for @xmath1o and @xmath2ca we find differences .",
    "these must be attributed to the error in energy introduced in @xcite by the approximate treatment of the exchange integrals .",
    "indeed , the integrals calculated analytically for @xmath36 and @xmath37 wave functions in @xmath1o agree exactly with the results of our numerical codes .",
    "the correct values of the binding energy per nucleon for initial configurations are 8.801 mev in @xmath1o and 11.137 mev in @xmath2ca , to be compared to 8.59 mev and 10.76 mev reported in @xcite .",
    "thus , the exact calculation of the exchange integrals alone points to the overbinding problem with the interaction ( [ inter ] ) .",
    "this problem is magnified if one cares for the hf solutions .",
    "the first issue is the binding energy of alpha particle which bears on the determination of interaction constants @xcite .",
    "the optimal wave function is more peaked than the gaussian used there .",
    "the hf binding energy per nucleon is 8.076 mev , i.e. 0.78 mev more than in @xcite where the experimental value corrected for coulomb interaction was used .",
    "thus , the interaction ( [ inter ] ) overbinds already @xmath0he when properly treated .",
    "the results for three nuclei are collected in table 1 . as seen there , the overbinding of @xmath1o , and especially @xmath2ca , is really serious . for @xmath1o , the calculated binding",
    "is 173.57 mev without coulomb while the experimental value is 127.619 mev @xcite . allowing about 13 mev for coulomb energy ( the direct term minus exchange , as it results from any realistic hf ) we get more than 30 mev overbinding . for @xmath2ca , the calculated binding of 565.17 mev , even after subtraction of about 71 mev of coulomb repulsion , is by about 152 mev ( ! ) larger than the experimental value of 342.052 mev @xcite . in table 1",
    ", we also give the difference in total binding ( without coulomb ) between our results and those of @xcite to emphasise the importance of proper hf minimization .",
    "the calculated self - consistent nuclear densities are depicted in figure 1 .",
    "the tendency towards central peak development is evident .",
    "it is worth noting that this tendency is already seen in inaccurate results of @xcite .",
    "the density of the @xmath2ca shown there exhibits a strange pile - up in the center . however",
    ", the hf results shown in figure 1 allow to appreciate that this problem is even more grave : the central density is more than 1.5 times larger in the case of @xmath1o , and three times larger in @xmath2ca than the experimental one ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the exact hf calculations with the recently proposed interaction ( [ inter ] ) for magic @xmath0he , @xmath1o and @xmath2ca nuclei show a serious overbindig problem .",
    "associated nuclear densities develop central peaks taking a form unknown in nuclear physics .",
    "both deficiencies grow with increasing mass . in view of the above results it is clear that the interaction proposed in @xcite is very far from a realistic nucleon - nucleon force .",
    "therefore , the assertions about the standing wave instability in nuclear matter made there , as related to unrealistic interaction , are unfounded ."
