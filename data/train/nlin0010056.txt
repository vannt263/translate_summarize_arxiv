    "fluctuations are inseparable part of the statistical laws .",
    "this is well known since boltzmann .",
    "what is apparently less known are the peculiar properties of rare big fluctuations ( bf ) as different from , and even opposite in a sense to , those of small stationary fluctuations . in this paper",
    "we consider the simplest type of chaotic dynamical systems , namely a finite  freedom hamiltonian system which admits the ( stable ) _ statistical equilibrium _ ( se ) .",
    "this class of dynamical models is still popular ( since boltzmann ! ) in debates over the dynamical foundations of statistical mechanics ( see , e.g. , `` round table on irreversibility '' in @xcite , and @xcite ) .    a fairly simple picture of bf in such systems is well understood by now , though not yet well known .",
    "to boltzmann such a picture was the basis of his fluctuation hypothesis for our universe . again , as is well understood by now such a hypothesis is completely incompatible with the present structure of the universe as it would immediately imply the notorious `` heat death '' ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . for this reason",
    ", one may even term such systems the _ heat death models_. nevertheless , they can be and actually are widely used in the description and study of local statistical processes in _ thermodynamically _ closed systems .",
    "the latter term means the absence of any heat exchange with the environment .",
    "notice , however , that under conditions of the exponential instability of motion , typical for chaotic systems , the only _ dynamically _ closed system would be the `` whole universe '' .",
    "particularly , this excludes the hypothetical `` velocity reversal '' also popular in debates over `` irreversibility '' since loschmidt ( for discussion see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    in any case , dynamical models with se do not tell us the whole story of either the universe or even a typical macroscopic process therein .",
    "the principal solution of this problem , unknown to boltzmann , is quite clear by now , namely , the `` equilibriumfree '' models are wanted .",
    "various classes of such models are intensively studied today . moreover ,",
    "the celebrated cosmic microwave background tells us that our universe _ was born _ already in the state of a heat death which , however , fortunately to us all became _ unstable _ due to the well  known jeans gravitational instability @xcite .",
    "this resulted in developing of a rich variety of collective processes , or _ synergetics _ , the term recently introduced or , better to say , put in use by haken @xcite .",
    "the most important peculiarity of such a collective instability is in that the total overall relaxation ( to somewhere ? ) with ever increasing total entropy is accompanied by an also increasing phase space _",
    "inhomogeneity _ of the system , particularly in temperature . in other words , the whole system as well as its local parts become more and more _ nonequilibrium _ to the extent of the birth of a _ secondary _ dynamics which may be , and is sometime , as perfect as , for example , the celestial mechanics ( for general discussion see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    we stress that all these inhomogeneous nonequilibrium structures are not bf like in se but are a result of regular collective instability , so that they are immediately formed under a certain condition .",
    "besides , they are typically _ dissipative structures _ in prigogine s term @xcite due to exchange of energy and entropy with the _ infinite _ environment .",
    "the latter is the most important feature of such processes , and at the same time the main difficulty in studying the dynamics of those models both theoretically and in numerical experiments which are so much simpler for se systems .    in the latter case",
    "a bf consists of the two symmetric parts : the rise of a fluctuation followed by its return , or relaxation , back to se ( see figs.1 and 2 below ) .",
    "both parts are described by the same kinetic ( e.g. , diffusion ) equation , the only difference being in the sign of time .",
    "this relates the time ",
    "symmetric dynamical equations to the time  antisymmetric",
    "_ kinetic _ ( but not statistical ! ) equations .",
    "the principal difference between the both , some times overlooked , is in that the kinetic equations are widely understood as describing the relaxation only , i.e. _ increase _ of the entropy in a closed system , whereas in fact they do so ( at least in se ) for the rise of bf as well , i.e. for the entropy _ decrease_. all this was qualitatively known already to boltzmann @xcite .",
    "the first simple example of symmetric bf was considered by schrdinger @xcite .",
    "rigorous mathematical theorem for the diffusive ( slow ) kinetics was proved by kolmogorov in 1937 in the paper entitled `` zur umkehrbarkeit der statistischen naturgesetze '' ( `` concerning reversibility of statistical laws in nature '' ) @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "regrettably , the principal kolmogorov theorem still remains unknown to both the participants of hot debates over `` irreversibility '' as well as the physicists actually studying such bf ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "by now , there exists the well developed ergodic theory of dynamical systems ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "particularly , it proves that the relaxation ( correlation decay , or mixing ) proceeds eventually in both directions of time for almost any initial conditions of a chaotic dynamical system .",
    "however , the relaxation does not need to be always monotonic which simply means a bf on the way , depending on the initial conditions .",
    "to get rid of such an apparently confusing ( to many ) `` freedom '' we take a different approach to the problem : instead discussing the `` true '' initial conditions and/or a `` necessary '' restriction of those we start our numerical experiments at _ arbitrary _ initial conditions ( most likely corresponding to se ) , and do _ observe _ what the dynamics and statistics of bf are like .",
    "of course , such an approach is based on a fundamental hypothesis that all the statistical laws are contained in , and can be principally derived from , the underlying fundamental ( hamiltonian ) dynamics . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", there is as yet no contradiction to this principal hypothesis .",
    "notice , however , that such an approach can be directly applied to the fluctuations in finite systems with statistical equilibrium only ( for discussion see @xcite and @xcite ) . in such , and only such , systems infinitely many bf grow up spontaneously _ independent _ of the initial conditions of the motion .",
    "this is similar to the well  known poincar recurrences ( for farther discussion see section 4 below ) .    in spite of the essential restrictions the simple se models allow us to better understand the mechanism and role of bf in the statistical physics .",
    "besides removal of a vague problem of the initial conditions such models help a lot in clarifying the relation between macroscopic and microscopic description of chaotic systems .",
    "particularly , spontaneous rise of a bf out of se is a _",
    "macroscopic _ event as well as its subsequent relaxation back to se , even in a few  freedom system .",
    "like other macroscopic processes the bf are not only perfectly regular by themselves but also surprisingly stable against any perturbations , both regular and chaotic .",
    "moreover , the perturbations do not need to be small . at first glance",
    ", it looks very strange in a chaotic , highly unstable , dynamics .",
    "the resolution of this apparent paradox is in that the dynamical instability of motion does affect the bf instant of time only . as to the bf evolution , it is determined by the kinetics whatever its mechanism , from purely dynamical one , like in model ( 2.2 ) we will use in this paper , to a completely noisy ( stochastic ) one . as a matter of fact",
    ", the fundamental kolmogorov theorem @xcite is related just to the latter case but remains valid in a much more general situation .",
    "surprising stability of bf is similar to the less known conception of robustness for the anosov ( strongly chaotic ) systems @xcite whose trajectories get only slightly deformed under a small perturbation ( for discussion see @xcite ) .    in the present paper",
    "we consider a particular type of bf which is characterized by a large concentration of `` particles '' in a small phase space domain of a dynamical system .",
    "in other words , `` our '' fluctuations are localized in phase space and separated in time .",
    "a more accurate definition of these fluctuations will be given below in section 3 ( see eq.(3.6 ) ) .",
    "the same fluctuations in a stochastic model ( with noise ) were studied in detail in @xcite . there",
    "exist , of course , many other fluctuations with their own peculiarities ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the primary goal of our studies was the macroscopic kinetics of big fluctuations on the background of small stationary microscopic fluctuations .",
    "a brief outline of our results was presented in @xcite .",
    "the systems with se allow for very simple models in both the theoretical analysis as well as numerical experiments which the latter are even more important for us . in the present paper",
    "we will use one of the most simple and popular model specified by the so  called arnold cat map ( see @xcite ) : @xmath0 which is a linear canonical map on a unit torus .",
    "it has no parameters , and is chaotic and even ergodic .",
    "the rate of the local exponential instability , the lyapunov exponent @xmath1 , implies a fast ( ballistic ) kinetics with relaxation time @xmath2 . throughout the paper @xmath3 denotes the time in map s iterations .    a minor modification of this map : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a circumference of the phase space torus allows us to study both a fast ( exponential ) ballistic kinetics ( for @xmath6 ) as well as the slow ( diffusive ) relaxation in @xmath7 ( for @xmath8 ) with characteristic time @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the diffusion rate in @xmath7 .",
    "in contrast to slow diffusion in @xmath7 , the relaxation time in @xmath11 does not depend on @xmath5 ( @xmath12 ) so that subsequent values of @xmath11 are practically uncorrelated",
    ". the map ( 2.2 ) has the ( unstable ) fixed point at @xmath13 .",
    "a convenient characteristic of bf size is rms volume ( area ) in 2d phase space ( @xmath14 ) @xmath15 occupied by a group of @xmath16 trajectories ( particles ) . in ergodic motion at equilibrium @xmath17 . due to a severe restriction to small @xmath18 in the numerical experiments ( see below ) we have to use simple ( average ) characteristics only like ( 2.3 ) .",
    "on the other hand , these are just the macroscopic variables we are interested in .    below",
    "we also restrict ourselves to a particular case of bf with the fixed prescribed position in the phase space : @xmath19 then , the variance of phase space size @xmath20 is determined by the relation @xmath21 where brackets @xmath22 denote the averaging over @xmath16 trajectories . in ergodic motion at equilibrium @xmath23 .",
    "in what follows we will use the dimensionless measure @xmath24 , and omit tilde . in diffusive approximation of the kinetic equation",
    "the variable @xmath25 is especially convenient as it is varying in proportion to time .",
    "moreover , @xmath26 in this case because of a quick relaxation @xmath27 in @xmath11 .    in all advantages of variable @xmath28",
    "its relation to the fundamental conception of entropy is highly desirable .",
    "the standard definition of the entropy , which can be traced back to boltzmann , reads : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a coarse  grained distribution function , or the phase  space density , and @xmath31 an arbitrary constant to be fixed later .",
    "notice that the distribution calculated from any _ finite _ number of trajectories is always a coarse  grained one .",
    "however , the direct application of eq.(2.6 ) requires too many trajectories , especially for bf of a small size .",
    "nevertheless , just in the latter case , which is the main problem under consideration , we have found a simple approximate relation @xmath32 which , at least , gives a rough estimate for the entropy evolution @xcite . moreover ,",
    "if the distribution is gaussian @xmath33 the estimate ( 2.7 ) becomes exact as it is directly followed from the definition of the entropy ( 2.6 ) .",
    "comparison of both relations for the entropy will be considered by the end of next section for a typical bf .",
    "a great advantage of ( 2.7 ) is in that the computation of @xmath34 does not require very many trajectories as does the distribution function .",
    "in fact , even a single trajectory is sufficient as fig.1 in @xcite and below demonstrate !    a finite number of trajectories used for calculating the variance @xmath28 is a sort of the coarse  grained distribution , as required in relation ( 2.6 ) , but with a free bin size which can be arbitrarily small .",
    "now we may turn to the numerical experiments .",
    "in this section we consider the regular bf kinetics .",
    "the data were obtained from simultaneous running of @xmath16 trajectories for very long time in order to collect sufficiently many bf for reliable separation of the regular part of bf , or the kinetic subdynamics in balescu s term ( see @xcite and references therein ) , from the stationary fluctuations .",
    "the separation was done by the plain averaging of individual @xmath35 values ( @xmath36 ) over all @xmath37 bf collected in a run .",
    "the size of bf chosen for further analysis was fixed by the condition that current @xmath38 at some time instant @xmath39 , the moment of bf . here",
    "a prescribed @xmath40 is the main input parameter of the run .",
    "this condition determines , in fact , the border of the whole fluctuation domain ( fd ) : @xmath41 .",
    "the event of entering fd is the macroscopic `` cause '' of bf whose obvious `` effect '' _ will be subsequent _ relaxation to the equilibrium .",
    "however , and this is the main point of our study , the second `` effect '' of the same `` cause '' _ was preceding _ rise of bf in apparent contradiction with the `` causality principle '' ( for discussion see @xcite and section 4 below ) . in any event",
    ", the second effect requires the permanent memory of trajectory segments within some time window @xmath42 which is another important input parameter of the run .",
    "the exact procedure of data processing during the run was as follows .",
    "starting from arbitrary ( random ) initial conditions the selection rule ( 3.1 ) is checked at each iteration .",
    "suppose , it is satisfied at some instance @xmath43 when the bundle of trajectories enters fd . in the first approximation",
    "we could consider it as the fluctuation maximum ( or variance minimum ) : @xmath44 where sub @xmath45 is the number of current fluctuation in a run .",
    "however , such a simple procedure would cause asymmetry with respect to @xmath46 . a better choice were the rule : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the exit moment of time from fd . instead",
    ", we have accepted the following , a more complicated procedure which , as we hope , better restores the true bf symmetry . starting from the moment @xmath43",
    "we search for the minimum of @xmath25 inside a rather large interval @xmath49 .",
    "if a minimum is found at some @xmath50 , we check that it is the minimum inside the next interval @xmath51 too .",
    "if so , we identify this minimum with the bf top , and set : @xmath52 , otherwise we put @xmath53 to the time of better minimum and repeat the last step again .",
    "obviuosly , the parameter @xmath42 should be small compared to @xmath54 , the mean period of bf , but sufficiently long for the trajectory to leave the fd ( 3.1 ) .",
    "typically , @xmath55 , the total diffusion time , was chosen .",
    "after fixing the current @xmath56 value the computation within the interval @xmath57 had been completed , and only then the search for the next bf was continued .    as was already mentioned above , there are two rather simple limiting cases of generally very complicated kinetics , namely the fast ( ballistic ) and slow ( diffusive ) ones .",
    "an example of both in one run for @xmath58 ( ! ) is presented in fig.1 for two fluctuations of different size . in this case the general condition ( 3.1 ) was checked separately for @xmath7 and @xmath11 : @xmath59 with @xmath60 and @xmath61 .    the fast part of kinetics is approximately described as @xmath62 where @xmath63 the lyapunov exponent ( section 2 ) , and where @xmath64 is the minimal variance averaged over all @xmath37 fluctuations observed in the run .",
    "notice that the latter value is considerably smaller than the border @xmath65 .",
    "this is because of penetration of trajectories into fd .",
    "interestingly , the ratio @xmath66 is the same for both runs in fig.1    surprisingly sharp crossover to diffusive kinetics , clearly seen in fig.1 , is related to the dynamical scale of diffusion which corresponds to a certain size @xmath67 of the increasing variance at which the exponential growth stops .",
    "roughly , it occurs at time @xmath68 when already @xmath69 , whence @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "hence , we can characterize the dynamical scale as @xmath72 where @xmath73 is an empirical factor , and @xmath74 is found from eq.(3.3 ) . from data in fig.1 the dynamical scale @xmath75 independent of @xmath40 which gives the empirical factor @xmath76 .    in the diffusion region ( @xmath77 ) the initial kinetics",
    "is described by a simple relation for the free diffusion ( see section 2 ) : @xmath78 which is also shown in fig.1 .",
    "it includes two corrections , @xmath74 and @xmath67 , due to the exponential ballistic kinetics .",
    "the first one with opposite signs for two symmetric parts of the fluctuation takes account for the `` lost '' time after ( or prior to ) anti  diffusion ( diffusion ) while the second correction describes a finite fluctuation size at the crossover from ( to ) the diffusion .",
    "the mean empirical @xmath79 , used in fig.1 , is close to the value @xmath80 found from eq.(3.4 ) with another empirical quantity @xmath81 .",
    "the large ratio @xmath82 of the mean fluctuation period @xmath54 to a characteristic time of diffusion relaxation ( see eq.(3.5 ) ) is the definition of _ big _ fluctuation .",
    "it guaranties the separation of successive fluctuations in time .",
    "now we turn to the main subject of our studies , the purely diffusive kinetics of big fluctuations . to this end",
    "we , first , get rid of @xmath11statistics excluding @xmath83 from the selection condition ( 3.1 ) which now reads : @xmath84 besides , the variance @xmath40 must now exceed the new dynamical border : @xmath85 with some empirical factor @xmath86 ( see eq.(3.4 ) , and discussion below ) .    a typical example of diffusive bf is shown in fig.2 . both the regular macroscopic kinetics of anti ",
    "diffusion / diffusion as well as irregular fluctuations around are clearly seen .",
    "notice that their size is rapidly decreasing toward the bf maximum .",
    "one may even get the impression that the motion becomes regular over there , hence the term `` optimal fluctuational path '' @xcite .",
    "in fact , the motion remains diffusive down to the dynamical scale @xmath87 ( 3.8 ) .    even though a separate bf by itself is fairly regular , the time instance of its spontaneous appearance @xmath56 , and hence the individual period @xmath88 , are random in the chaotic system . due to statistical independence of bf under condition ( 3.6 )",
    "the expected distribution in @xmath88 is poissonian ( fig.3 ) : @xmath89    the principal characteristic of the period statistics , @xmath54 , can be estimated as follows . from the ergodicity of motion in the @xmath16dimensional momentum space",
    "the ratio @xmath90 this is exact relation ( in the limit @xmath91 ) where @xmath92 is the total sojourn time of trajectories within fd ( under condition @xmath93 ) during the whole run time @xmath94 , and @xmath95 is the same per fluctuation .",
    "both ratios are equal to the ratio of @xmath16dimensional momentum volume @xmath96 of the fluctuation at @xmath97 to that in equilibrium .",
    "the ratio @xmath98 was also measured during the run .",
    "hence @xmath99    the next more difficult step is evaluation of @xmath100 from the diffusion equation where @xmath101 is the exit ( or entrance due to symmetry ) time from ( or to ) fd .",
    "a simple crude estimate is : @xmath102 ( section 2 ) .",
    "however , the first numerical experiments have already revealed that the actual exit time is much shorter , roughly by a factor of @xmath103 .",
    "a plausible explanation is in that the most of distribution inside fd is concentrated in a relatively narrow layer at the surface of @xmath16dimensional sphere determined by the selection condition @xmath93 ( 3.7 ) .",
    "then , the relative width of the layer @xmath104 implies the observed factor @xmath105 .",
    "father , the ratio @xmath106 where the geometrical function @xmath107 admits a fairly accurate approximation down to @xmath58 ( see fig.4 ) .",
    "collecting all the formulae above , we arrive at our final empirical relation @xmath108 with two fitting factors , @xmath109 for the layer width , and @xmath110 for all other approximations above .",
    "both factors can not be united in one because the former enters a new expression for the dynamical scale which naturally generalizes eq.(3.8 ) .",
    "together with inequality ( 3.6 ) for big fluctuation the new dynamical scale was using for selection of purely diffusive bf which are described by eq.(3.14 ) .",
    "the corresponding inequality reads ( cf .",
    "eq.(3.8 ) ) : @xmath111 which means that even a small part ( @xmath112 ) of fd must exceed the dynamical scale .",
    "optimization of all empirical parameters was done as follows .",
    "the values of two factors , @xmath113 in eq.(3.6 ) and @xmath114 in ( 3.15 ) , are not crucial that is the larger they are the better for selection of purely diffusive bf .",
    "however , this reduces the amount of empirical data available .",
    "a compromise was found at @xmath115 and @xmath116 which leaves 36 runs of 61 done , and 34429 of overall",
    "75053 bf computed with @xmath117 for comparison to eq.(3.14 ) .",
    "this was executed in the following way . for each selected run with parameters @xmath118 , and computed @xmath54 and @xmath98 the empirical factor @xmath110 supposed to be a constant was calculated from the first eq.(3.14 ) .",
    "the value of parameter @xmath109 was chosen by minimizing the relative standard deviation down to @xmath119 .",
    "the result , for a given set of data , was @xmath120 .",
    "the final dependence @xmath121 is shown in fig.5 where the bars are the statistical errors @xmath122 for each run .    coming to analysis of our main theoretical result , the second eq.(3.14 ) , we first remark that it does not describe at all a single trajectory ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "this is because we excluded @xmath123 from the selection condition ( 3.7 ) ( cf .",
    "eq.(3.2 ) ) , and thus reduced the dimension of phase space to the minimal value , the unity . in this case , a single trajectory repeatedly crosses fd with a period @xmath124 , the whole diffusion time around the phase space torus , independent of fd size .",
    "more formally , it follows also from eq.(3.14 ) since condition ( 3.6 ) can not be satisfied for small @xmath40 .    in case of two trajectories ( @xmath125 )",
    "the period does not depend on @xmath40 , and for data in fig.5 the ratio @xmath126 .",
    "due to fluctuations the actual values of this ratio are in the interval @xmath127 , still not too big for a big fluctuation .",
    "apparently , this leads to a relatively large scattering of points with @xmath125 which also persists for @xmath128 too .    the main , exponential in @xmath16 , dependence in eq.(3.14 )",
    "is readily derived from a graphic picture of @xmath16 statistically independent particles gathering together inside a small domain with probability @xmath129 .",
    "such estimates are known for the poincar recurrences since boltzmann @xcite .",
    "the estimate is especially vivid in geometrical picture of @xmath16dimensional sphere of radius @xmath130 considered above .",
    "our empirical relation ( 3.14 ) considerably improves the simple estimate including a more weak power  law dependence which is evident in fig.5 .    in our studies described above we fixed the position of bf in the phase space , eq.(2.4 ) .",
    "if we lift this restriction , the probability of bf would increase by a factor of @xmath131 , or by decrease of @xmath16 by one ( @xmath132 ) because now only @xmath133 trajectories remain independent . with the latter change",
    "all the above relations would presumably still hold true .",
    "our main relation ( 3.14 ) describes the diffusive kinetics for @xmath134 , eq.(3.15 ) , when a big fluctuation is not too big . in the opposite case @xmath135 of a very big fluctuation , like in fig.1 ,",
    "the dependence @xmath136 becomes much simpler + ( see eqs.(3.11 ) - ( 3.13 ) , and @xcite ) : @xmath137 this is explained by a fast exponential kinetics near bf top ( fig.1 ) which implies the most short exit time @xmath138 and , hence , @xmath139 .",
    "indeed , for both bf in fig.1 the empirical value of the product @xmath140 .    in conclusion of this section we show in fig.6 the macroscopic kinetics of bf entropy ,",
    "both `` exact '' ( 2.6 ) , calculated on the partition of the whole interval + ( @xmath141 ) into @xmath142 bins , and that in our approximation ( 2.7 ) .",
    "both entropies were calculated for the same 5 trajectories in one run .",
    "a necessary statistics for exact entropy was obtained at the expense of a large number @xmath143 of fluctuations in the run .",
    "for comparison of both entropies we need , first , to adjust the constant @xmath31 in eq.(2.6 ) .",
    "as is easily verified , the gaussian distribution ( 2.8 ) leads exactly to the relation ( 2.7 ) if the constant @xmath144 approximation ( 2.7 ) holds on the most part of bf except a relatively small domain near the equilibrium where the distribution in @xmath7 approaches the homogeneous one .",
    "the exact entropy ( with constant ( 3.17 ) ) in equilibrium is @xmath145 instead of zero in approximation ( 2.7 ) .",
    "the difference is relatively small , the smaller the bigger is the fluctuation . in the main part of bf",
    "our simple relation of the entropy ( 2.7 ) reproduces the exact one ( 2.6 ) to a surprisingly good accuracy which confirms that the distribution in @xmath7 is indeed very close to the gaussian one ( 2.8 ) as expected .",
    "in the present paper the results of extensive numerical experiments on big entropy fluctuations ( bf ) in a statistical equilibrium ( se ) of classical dynamical systems are presented , and their peculiarities are analysed and discussed .",
    "\\(2 ) inserting a special ( unstable ) fixed point for a better demonstration of exponential ballistic kinetics as well ( fig.1 ) .",
    "besides , this point was used as a fixed position of bf , thus relating our studies of bf to another interesting and important problem , the poincar recurrences ( see eq.(2.2 ) ) .",
    "the most important distinction of our approach to the problem was in that we have abandoned from the beginning a vague question of the initial conditions , particularly a `` necessary '' restriction of those in statistical physics .",
    "instead , we started our numerical experiments at _ arbitrary _ initial conditions ( most likely corresponding to se ) , and did _ observe _ what the dynamics and statistics of bf were like . in other words , we studied the _ spontaneous _ bf only .",
    "what is also important , such a spontaneous rise of bf out of se as well as its subsequent relaxation back to se can be considered as a statistical _ macroscopic _ event , even in a few  freedom system like ( 2.2 )",
    ". the term `` macroscopic '' refers here to average quantities as variance , entropy , mean period , distribution function , and the like .",
    "we consider a particular class of bf which we call the boltzmann fluctuations .",
    "they are obviously symmetric with respect to time reversal ( see figs . 1 , 2 and 6 ) , so that at least in this case there is no physical reason at all for the conception of the notorious _time _",
    "arrow. nevertheless , a related conception , say , _ thermodynamic _ arrow , pointing in the direction of the average increase of entropy , makes sense in spite of the time symmetry @xcite .",
    "the point is that the bf characteristic relaxation time is determined by model s parameter @xmath5 only , and does not depend on the bf itself . on the contrary",
    ", the expectation time for a given bf , or the mean period between successive fluctuations , rapidly grows with bf size and with the number of trajectories ( or freedoms ) , eq.(3.14 ) . a large ratio of both @xmath146 is our _ definition _ of big fluctuation , eq.(3.6 ) .",
    "a similar result was obtained recently in @xcite but the authors missed the principal difference between the time arrow and thermodynamic arrow .",
    "a related notion of _ causality _ arrow , which by definition points from an _ independent _ macroscopic cause to its effect , also makes some physical sense ( for discussion see @xcite and section 3 above ) . for boltzmann s bf considered in the present paper the directions of both arrows do coincide _ independent _ of the direction of time .",
    "the latter statement is the most important , in our opinion , philosophical `` moral '' the principally well  known boltzmann fluctuations do teach us .",
    "even though we prefer the discussion and interpretation of our empirical results in terms of entropy ( @xmath34 ) , the most fundamental conception in statistical physics , we actually use in our studies another , entropy ",
    "like , quantity , the variance @xmath25 for a group of @xmath16 trajectories , eq.(2.5 ) .",
    "one reason is technical : the computation of @xmath28 is much simpler while that for @xmath147 is either very time  consuming in numerical experiments ( for exact @xmath34 ( 2.6 ) ) or approximate ( 2.7 ) .",
    "besides , for diffusive kinetics , we are mainly interested in , the variance is natural variable in which the bf picture is most simple and comprehensible .",
    "originally , we planned to cover both sides of the bf phenomenon , the regular macroscopic kinetics as well as accompanying microscopic fluctuations ( noise ) around .",
    "however , our numerical experiments revealed a much more complicated structure of the latter as an example in fig.2 demonstrates .",
    "the dependence @xmath25 looks like a fractal curve on a variety of time scales , from the minimal one @xmath148 iteration up to @xmath149 comparable to that of bf itself .",
    "this interesting problem certainly requires and deserves farther special studies .    in the present paper",
    "the fluctuations in classical mechanics are considered only .",
    "generally , the quantum fluctuations would be rather different .",
    "however , according to the correspondence principle , the dynamics and statistics of a quantum system in quasiclassics are close to the classical ones on the appropriate time scales of which the longest one corresponds just to the diffusive kinetics , and provides the necessary transition to the classical limit ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "curiously , the computer classical dynamics that is the simulation of a classical dynamical system on digital computer is of a qualitatively similar character .",
    "this is because any quantity in computer representation is discrete ( `` overquantized '' ) . as a result",
    "the correspondence between the classical continuous dynamics and its computer representation in numerical experiments is generally restricted to certain finite time scales like in the quantum mechanics ( see two first references @xcite ) .",
    "discreteness of the computer phase space leads to another peculiar phenomenon : generally , the computer dynamics is irreversible due to the rounding  off operation unless the special algorithm is used in numerical experiments .",
    "nevertheless , this does not affect the statistical properties of chaotic computer dynamics .",
    "particularly , the statistical laws in computer representation remain time ",
    "reversible in spite of ( nondissipative ) irreversibility of the underlying dynamics .",
    "this simple example demonstrates that , contrary to a common belief , the statistical reversibility is a more general property than the dynamical one",
