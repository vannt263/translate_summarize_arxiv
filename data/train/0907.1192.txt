    "astrophysical estimates of changes of @xmath32 at high redshifs are controversial with claims of nonzero and zero changes : @xmath34 was inferred from the analysis of the h@xmath5-bearing clouds at @xmath35 and @xmath36 @xcite , but this value was not confirmed later @xcite .",
    "more stringent bounds are obtained at redshifts @xmath37 and @xmath38 from the analysis of radio - frequency transitions in nh@xmath2 and other molecules such as co , hco@xmath6 , hc@xmath2n providing @xmath39 , @xmath40 @xcite , which favors a non - variability of @xmath32 at a level of @xmath41 .    in these studies it is implicitly assumed that the rate of time variations dominates over possible spatial variations . however , if scalar fields trace the gravitational field inhomogeneities spatial variation could be present as well @xcite .",
    "the circumstance of spatial variations of constants are tested by measurements of the atomic clock transition in laboratories on earth orbiting in the changing gravitational potential of the sun .",
    "the laboratory experiments constrain the couplings of @xmath22 and @xmath32 to the gravitational field at a level of @xmath42 , @xmath43 @xcite . to reconcile these results with quintessence , chameleon - type models",
    "were suggested which allow scalar fields to evolve on cosmological time scales today and to have simultaneous strong couplings of order unity to matter @xcite . in these models",
    "the mass of the scalar field depends on the local matter density , which explains why cosmological scalar fields , such as quintessence , are not detectable in local tests of the equivalence principle . on earth in a dense environment the mass of the field can be sufficiently large and @xmath18-mediated interactions are short - ranged . on the other hand ,",
    "the cosmological matter density is about @xmath44 times smaller and the mass of the scalar field can be very low , of order of @xmath45 , allowing the field to evolve cosmologically .",
    "in this paper we apply the ammonia method for the first time to milky way sources .",
    "a detailed and exaustive account has been provided in @xcite .",
    "among molecules , ammonia is of particular interest due to its high sensitivity to changes in the electron - to - proton mass ratio , @xmath32 @xcite . for nh@xmath2 ,",
    "the sensitivity coefficient of the inversion transition @xmath46 ghz was calculated in @xcite : @xmath47 by comparing the observed inversion frequency of nh@xmath2 ( 1,1 ) with a suitable rotational frequency of another molecule arising co - spatially , a limit on the spatial variation of @xmath32 can be determined : @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the apparent radial velocities of the rotational and inversion transitions , respectively .",
    "thus the comparison of the relative radial velocities of ammonia inversion lines and rotational transitions of another n - bearing ( n@xmath5h@xmath6 ) and c - bearing ( ccs , hc@xmath2n ) molecules can be used to set a limit on spatial variations of @xmath13 .",
    "these molecules are often detected in the molecular clouds allowing to probe this constant in the milky way . in molecular clouds",
    "considerable fraction of material is not participating in the process of star formation residing in cold and dense clouds which are well suited for accurate measurements .",
    "these can be low - mass protostellar cores containing infrared sources , or even starless cores without embedded luminous sources .",
    "the physical conditions of the latter are of dense molecular gas preceding gravitational collapse and when the gas density in the core center is @xmath51 @xmath52they can be dynamically stable against gravitational contraction @xcite .",
    "typical cores have mean gas density @xmath53 @xmath52 , velocity dispersion @xmath54 km  s@xmath10 , kinetic temperature @xmath55 k , radius @xmath56 pc , mass @xmath57 and nh@xmath2 , n@xmath5h@xmath6 , ccs , and hc@xmath2n are usually observed in emission .",
    "an ammonia spectral atlas of 193 dense protostellar and prestellar cores of low masses in the perseus molecular cloud is provided by @xcite .",
    "the spectral observations of the cores in nh@xmath2 ( 1,1 ) , ( 2,2 ) , ccs ( @xmath58 ) and cc@xmath59s ( @xmath58 ) lines were carried out simultaneously using the 100-m green bank telescope ( gbt ) .",
    "each target was observed in a single - pointing , frequency - switched mode . the gbt beam size at 23 ghz is @xmath60 or 0.04 pc at the distance of 260 pc of perseus cloud .",
    "the spectral resolution was 24 m  s@xmath10and both molecules were observed with similar angular and spectral resolutions .",
    "the atlas of 193 sources is very conveniently presented on the website ( see @xcite for details ) where the original spectra are shown along with the best fitting models , model parameters and their uncertainties .",
    "the number of cores where both ccs ( @xmath58 ) and nh@xmath2 ( 1,1 ) lines were detected is 98 .",
    "the central velocities of these lines , being averaged with weights inversely proportional to the variances of the measurements , reveal that @xmath8= 16 m  s@xmath10 .",
    "it was suggested @xcite that this offset is due to uncertainties in the assumed rest frequency of the ccs line which is of 13.5 m  s@xmath10(cfr table 1 ) .",
    "however , the unweighted averaging , which is more appropriate in the presence of unaccounted errors , gives @xmath61 m  s@xmath10     many cores show evidence for the multiple velocity components along the line - of - sight .",
    "the selection of simple profiles which have been satisfactorily fitted by a single component model provides a sample of @xmath62 pairs the weighted mean for this sample gives @xmath63 m  s@xmath10 . and",
    "@xmath64 m  s@xmath10for the unweighted mean @xcite",
    ".    a further refinement of the sample could be done taking only cores which show line broadening values between pure turbulent , @xmath65 , and pure thermal , @xmath66 , regimes , which should be the case if both emission lines arise co - spatially .",
    "this requirement further reduce the sample to @xmath67 clouds with @xmath68 m  s@xmath10 , and @xmath69 m  s@xmath10for the weighted and unweighted mean respectively .",
    "the fact that scatter remains rather constant in the various samples reflects the complexity of gas kinematics and effects of chemical segregation of one molecule with respect to the other in dense molecular cores which are the dominant sources of error .    the unweighted mean from the @xmath67 sample",
    "could be taken as the best estimate of the velocity offset for the perseus dark cores , but in fact we could have taken any of the former samples without changing significantly the result .",
    "when we account for uncertainties in the rest frequencies , we have @xmath8=@xmath70 m  s@xmath10 .",
    "other observations in the pipe nebula @xcite and in infrared dark clouds @xcite are examined in @xcite .",
    "8 pairs in the pipe nebula provide @xmath8=@xmath71 m  s@xmath10 .",
    "36 nh@xmath2/n@xmath5h@xmath6 and 27 nh@xmath2/hc@xmath2n pairs observed in infrared dark clouds , which are much more massive than the dense cores , provide @xmath72@xmath73 m  s@xmath10  and @xmath74=@xmath75 m  s@xmath10 , respectively , thus supporting the results found in the perseus region .",
    "recently pagani et al . @xcite have compared the n@xmath5h@xmath6 and n@xmath5d@xmath6 transitions with the transitions of nh@xmath2 in the dark cloud l183 .",
    "the whole elongated dense core of l183 has been fully mapped in n@xmath5h@xmath6 and n@xmath5d@xmath6 ( j:10 ) lines with the iram 30-m telescope with velocity resolution in the range 3050 m  s@xmath10 .",
    "spatial resolution ranges from 33 arcsec at 77 ghz to 9 arcsec at 279 ghz .",
    "the spatial sampling is 12 arcsec for the main prestellar core and 15 arcsec for the southern and northern extension of the prestellar core .",
    "observations of nh@xmath2 ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) inversion lines have been performed at the green bank 100-m telescope with velocity sampling of 20 ms@xmath24 , angular resolution of @xmath7635 arcsec and spatial sampling of 24 arcsec all over the source .",
    "extremely narrow molecular lines observed in this cold dark cloud provide a sensitive spectroscopic tool to track small systematic velocity gradients and to align values of poorly known frequencies with more reliable ones . for the latter , nh@xmath2 is the molecule of choice since it is stable and its frequencies are accurately measured in the laboratory .",
    "nh@xmath2 ( 1,1 ) average frequency from the whole hfs is @xmath77  =  23694495487 ( @xmath7848 ) hz @xcite , or @xmath77",
    "=  23694495481 @xmath78 22 hz from the revision of hougen @xcite .",
    "thus nh@xmath2 provides a reference transition known with a precision of few 10@xmath79 or @xmath80 m  s@xmath10  .",
    "ammonia and diazenylium have the same chemical origin , starting from n@xmath5 and are well - known to be coexistent as discussed by e.g. @xcite .",
    "in l183 the velocity along the dense filament is constantly changing suggesting a flow towards the prestellar cores and a rotation of the filament around its vertical axis .",
    "nh@xmath2  ( 1,1 ) , n@xmath5h@xmath6 and n@xmath5d@xmath6 ( j:10 ) all trace exactly the same gradients and it seems therefore compulsory that their velocities be identical as there is no obvious possibility that the velocity gradients be exactly parallel but offset from each other , especially in the case of a cylinder rotation .",
    "finally , the fact that n@xmath5d@xmath6 velocity centroids are almost identical with those of n@xmath5h@xmath6 indicates that the different opacities of the lines are not introducing any measurable bias here .",
    "a similar behaviour of all the three molecules shows that these share the same volume of the cloud and undergo the same macroscopic velocity shifts .",
    ".molecular transitions and uncertainties , @xmath81 , the numbers in parentheses correspond to @xmath21 errors . [ cols= \"",
    "< , < , > \" , ]     on the basis that all the three species are spatially coexistent and trace the same velocities pagani et al @xcite used the observed offset to adjust the frequencies of n@xmath5h@xmath6 and n@xmath5d@xmath6 to that of nh@xmath2 . for the reference position alone , the difference is of @xmath82=@xmath83 m  s@xmath24 and @xmath82=@xmath84  m  s@xmath24 on 65 common positions .",
    "for the three transitions of n@xmath5d@xmath6 , the direct comparison of the reference position with nh@xmath2(1,1 ) spectrum yields ( j:10 ) : 37.7 @xmath78 0.85 m  s@xmath10(j:21 ) : 47.7 @xmath78 0.92 m  s@xmath10(j:32 ) : 63.6 @xmath78 4.7 m  s@xmath10and similar offsets are found for n@xmath5d@xmath6 ( cfr @xcite for details ) .",
    "the rest frequencies for the molecule n@xmath5h@xmath6 in @xcite analysis were taken from @xcite and are known with precision of @xmath85 khz . however , an error of 4 khz is given in the cologne database for molecular spectroscopy ( cdms ) .",
    "the difference between the data from @xcite and the cdms frequencies is @xmath86 m  s@xmath10and the pagani et al velocity offset between n@xmath5h@xmath6 and nh@xmath2 should be corrected by this difference when adopting the cdms rest frequency .",
    "at the high spectral resolution of these observations the errors in the molecular line position measurements are mainly restricted by the uncertainties in laboratory frequencies , @xmath87 khz , which correspond to the @xmath88 uncertainties of @xmath89 m  s@xmath10   taking into account that @xmath13@xmath90 , these errors implies a sensitivity in @xmath13   at a level of @xmath91 , i.e. about 100 times more sensitive than the @xmath13  estimate deduced at @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "this level of accuracy can be achieved when assuming that molecules are co - spatially distributed within the cloud , and are observed simultaneously with the same receiver , beam size , system temperature , and velocity resolution .",
    "violation of any of these conditions leads to shifts of the line centers .",
    "overall the observations in the perseus dense cores as well as in the l183 core allow a maximum offset between ammonia and the other molecules of @xmath12 m  s@xmath10   in the most conservative way , which corresponds to @xmath13@xmath14 , i.e. an order of magnitude more sensitive than previous astronomical constraints on @xmath92 .",
    "this firm bound is in conflict with the value @xmath93 obtained from molecular hydrogen h@xmath5 absorption lines at @xmath94 @xcite .",
    "however , the variability of @xmath32 was not confirmed at the level of @xmath95 @xcite and , recently , a more stringent limit on @xmath13  was found at @xmath94 , @xmath96 @xcite .",
    "these extragalactic measurements of @xmath13   are performed in systems in which gas densities are similar to those in the milky way clouds .",
    "thus also in the high-@xmath97 absorbers the dependence of @xmath32 on @xmath98 is extremely weak , and the value of @xmath13 in quasar absorbers is expected to be at the same level as in the interstellar clouds , i.e. @xmath99 . if a @xmath13  is found above this value , then the variation should be temporal rather than spatial",
    ".      taken at face value the measured @xmath15 in perseus and l183 being similar while involving different molecules show the possibility of a positive shifts between the line centers of nh@xmath2 and other molecules of the order of 40 m  s@xmath10 .",
    "this would imply a @xmath13@xmath16 .    in theories which consider a direct coupling between the local matter density and the scalar fields driving varying constants the spatial change of the constants is proportional to the local gravitational potential @xcite ( and references cited therein ) .",
    "the effect of scalar fields on @xmath32 can be expressed as @xmath100 where @xmath101 is a dimensionless coupling constant of a very light scalar field to the local gravitational potential @xmath102 , and @xmath103 is the difference of the gravitational potentials between two measurement points . since in our case @xmath104 , a value of @xmath13= @xmath105 would require @xmath106 , which is inconsistent with the @xmath107estimated from atomic clock experiments @xcite .",
    "however , chameleon models are specifically conceived to circumvent this type of conflict .",
    "the baryon masses and coupling constants are strongly dependent on the local matter density , @xmath98 , @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the scalar field in these models depends on @xmath98 : in low - density environments it is determined by the scalar field potential @xmath108 , whereas in high - density regions like the earth s surface it is set by the matter-@xmath18 coupling .",
    "the range of the scalar - mediated force for the terrestrial matter densities is then very short , less than 1 mm @xcite . because of the strong @xmath18-coupling to matter the measurements of the frequency drifts in the atomic clock experiments ought to be insensitive to the changes in the gravitational potential at earth caused by the eccentricity of earth s orbit .",
    "we note that the difference of matter densities between the terrestrial environment ( @xmath109 gev  @xmath52 ) and , e.g. , dense molecular cores ( @xmath110 gev  @xmath52 ) is of 20 orders of magnitude .",
    "thus , @xmath13  variation @xmath13= @xmath105 require models which treat the @xmath18-mediated force as a short - range force depending on the matter density . in accord with model predictions ,",
    "the estimated value of the scalar field is much less than one . in this way",
    "the measured spatial variation of @xmath13  does not contradict the laboratory studies on atomic clocks due to the extremely different density environment in the terrestrial measurements and in the interstellar medium .",
    "1 .   several molecules and in different environments in the milky way are used to probe @xmath13 variations by means of the nh@xmath2 method .",
    "this is done by using ccs measured in almost one hundred of dense perseus clouds and n@xmath5h@xmath6 and n@xmath5d@xmath6 in a detailed high spatial resolution survey of the dense core l183 .",
    "2 .   these observations provide evidence that nh@xmath2 does not change by more than 100 m  s@xmath10  allowing us to place a robust bound of @xmath13@xmath111 which is more than an order of magnitude more stringent than the extragalactic bounds of the same quantity .",
    "3 .   both sets of comparison point for a common offset of about 40 m  s@xmath10 .",
    "although it is possible that this offset results from rest frequency uncertainties the fact that several transitions are involved suggest that the effect might be real .",
    "an intrinsic shift of 40 m  s@xmath10would correspond to @xmath13@xmath16 .",
    "4 .   to cope with solar system experiments the effect would require chameleon - type scalar field models which predict a strong dependence of masses and coupling constants on the ambient matter density .",
    "5 .   new observations to verify this possibility are solicited , and some are underway at radio telescopes of medicina , effelsberg and nobeyama .    *",
