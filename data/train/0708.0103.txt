    "the transport properties of electron waves in the second subband is very different to that in the first subband .",
    "the overall feature is that the low kinetic energy electron exhibits higher conductance .",
    "the strong suppression in conductance at higher subband implies the better inter - dot coupling enhancing backscattering .    figure [ g - dd](b )",
    "shows the energy dependence of conductance for the case of @xmath79  t. the gap feature in conductance at the low kinetic energy of the first subband is narrower than that induced by the magnetic field @xmath67  t. the dip structure in conductance related to the formation of quasibound state at around the energy @xmath114 is almost the same as the case of @xmath67  t , but the dip structure at higher energy in the first subband is shifted toward the lower energy .",
    "a new clear sharp dip structure is formed just below the threshold of the second subband .",
    "since the wave function of the electrons occupying the second subband in @xmath79  t fits the geometry of the double - dot system , the electron wave thus favors to turn around through the double - dot , and then the conductance is strongly suppressed .",
    "the conductance at energies higher than the third subband threshold for the case of @xmath79  t is a little higher than that of @xmath67  t.          figure [ dd-05 t ] demonstrates the snapshots of the electron wave packet propagation through an embedded parallel double - dot system for the case of @xmath67  t at the time @xmath115 ( a ) 0 ; ( b ) 9 ; ( c ) 25 ; and ( d ) 38  ps . at time @xmath1150  ps , we see that the incident wave packet has a compact longitudinal distribution @xmath116 with height 1.5 . in ( b ) , at @xmath117  ps , the electron wave packet arrives at the upper open dot and form a clear quasibound state with packet height 2.0 . at this moment , both the backward reflection and the forward transmission are blocked by the double - dot system .    during the time evolution @xmath118  ps",
    ", the higher energy part of the electron wave packet is closer to the upper boundary and traveling faster than the lower energy part of the wave packet .",
    "this makes the electron wave packet to skew with a clockwise rotation . before being scattered by the double - dot system , the spreading effect proceeds slowly .",
    "when the electron wave packet is scattered by the double - dot system , the forward scattered wave packet exhibits faster spreading in the longitudinal direction manifesting a long - tail behavior caused by the slow release of the probability by the long - lived resonance state .          in ( c ) , at the time 25  ps , part of the wave packet",
    "is clearly coupled to the lower dot although part of the wave packet has been forward scattered showing skipping - like trajectories and traveling into the right asymptotic region .",
    "the skipping - like behavior implies a significant intersubband mixing due to the broad wave packet distribution in the momentum space . at @xmath119",
    "ps , the longitudinal distribution of the forward scattered wave packet is getting broader ; and the localized part remains in the double - dot region with approximately a half packet height of the localized state formed at @xmath117  ps as shown in ( b ) .",
    "we would like to mention in passing that the reflection wave packet takes more time to emerge than the transmission wave packet due to the formation of the quasibound states in the double - dot embedded system .",
    "we show , in , that the snapshots of the electron wave packet propagation through an embedded parallel double - dot system for the case of @xmath79  t at the time @xmath115 ( a ) 0 ; ( b ) 11 ; ( c ) 21 ; ( d ) 40  ps . it is shown in ( a ) that , at time @xmath80  ps",

    "a clear localized quasibound state feature is found at @xmath1159  ps as is shown in ( b ) .",
    "the height of the probability density of the localized state is twice the height of the initial wave packet . at this moment ,",
    "the backward reflection is blocked and the forward transmission is relatively low .    the wave packet propagation at the moment @xmath121  ps is depicted in ( c ) .",
    "the forward scattered wave packet exhibits rich and robust transport behavior . not only the skipping - like wave packet flight is found , but also an interference feature attributed to the intersubband mixing is significantly manifested . at time @xmath102  ps shown in ( d ) , the skipping - like trajectory is still significant but the interference feature is suppressed .",
    "in addition , the inter - dot coupling of the wave packet in @xmath79  t is weaker than that in @xmath67  t due to the stronger lorentz force enhancing off - center shifting .",
    "the localized state for the case of @xmath67  t is covering two quantum dots whereas the localized state for the case of @xmath79  t is mainly in the upper dot .",
    "this implies that the @xmath122  t magnetic field fits better to the length scales of the double - dot system .",
    "in this work we have developed a theoretical model by implementing the lippmann - schwinger formalism to demonstrate and elucidate the transport properties of a gaussian - type electron wave packet traveling through a quantum wire with embedded quantum dots under a homogeneous perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "the magnetic field induces lorentz force , which enriches the dynamics of electron wave packet propagation .",
    "we have found that quantum skipping - like oscillation trajectory of a wave packet is induced in an appropriate magnetic field when the wave packet envelop function covers the lowest two subbands . this is a quantum forerunner to the well known skipping orbit motion of classical particles .    for the case of an embedded antidot , the electron wave packet has been considered with momentum envelop covering the lowest two subbands .",
    "the wave packet propagation exhibiting non - skipping - like trajectories implies that the significance of the wave packet propagation is staying in the lowest subband .",
    "the part of the wave packet with high kinetic tends to go through the antidot system but the the part with low kinetic energy is backscattered by the scattering region .",
    "quasibound state features with negative binding energies have also been seen to play an active role in the scattering process .    for the case of embedded double quantum dot , we have found a robust trapping effect of the electronic wave packet moving into the double - dot system and forming localized states .",
    "if there are several bound states , the electrons make multiple scattering in the coupled double quantum dot resulting in a superposition of these bound states , exhibiting oscillating behavior in the double - dot system .",
    "the parallel double - dot system enables the electron wave packet performing resonant coupling between two dots in an appropriate magnetic field and then allows electron wave packet performing inter - edge backscattering .",
    "the coherent motion of electron waves through open nanostructures in a penetrating magnetic field may offer promising approaches to semiconductor spintronics@xcite and controlling the dynamics of coherent quantum states for quantum information processing.@xcite to explore these new directions , we need to track the motion of electron waves in an applied magnetic field . the cooled scanning probe microscope renders the possibility of imaging the electron wave trajectories by using the scanning tip as a movable gate.@xcite very recently , quantum dot embedded mesoscopic system has been utilized for the coherent probing of excited quantum dot states.@xcite we hope that our paper will stimulate experimental interest to nanostructure embedded quantum systems in the strong coupling regime , which may provide a useful tool for the dynamical quantum manipulation of charged carriers .",

    "<S> we consider wave packet propagation in a quantum wire with either an embedded antidot or an embedded parallel double open quantum dot under the influence of a uniform magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetoconductance and the time evolution of an electron wave packet are calculated based on the lippmann - schwinger formalism . </S>",
    "<S> this approach allows us to look at arbitrary embedded potential profiles and illustrate the results by performing computational simulations for the conductance and the time evolution of the electron wave packet through the quantum wire . in the double - dot system </S>",
    "<S> we observe a long - lived resonance state that enhances the spatial spreading of the wave packet , and quantum skipping - like trajectories are induced when the envelop function of the wave packet covers several subbands in appropriate magnetic fields . </S>"
