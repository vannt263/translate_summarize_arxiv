    "understanding how varying the shape and strength of a pair potential affects the energy landscape and dynamics of systems composed of several particles interacting via that potential lies at the heart of theoretical cluster physics @xcite .",
    "variable - shape potentials are of particular utility in understanding common features of apparently disparate systems .",
    "for example , varying the dimensionless range parameter @xmath3 of the morse potential @xmath4 , \\label{eq : morsepot}\\ ] ] yields accurate models for clusters formed by constituents ranging from alkali - metal atoms to buckyballs to micron - sized colloids @xcite .",
    "studies of colloidal clusters are particularly valuable in this context since individual particle positions can be tracked .",
    "most valuable are `` model '' systems with precisely controllable interparticle interactions and cluster size @xmath0 .",
    "these systems are a veritable playground for studies of few - body statistical mechanics , and can ( through the universality evident in cluster physics ) provide insights into the behavior of their more microscopic counterparts .",
    "manoharan and collaborators have recently attracted great interest by characterizing the structure and dynamics @xcite of colloids interacting via hard - core - like repulsive and ( variably ) short - ranged attractive interactions .",
    "while published experimental studies and related theoretical modeling @xcite of these systems have focused on equilibrium phenomena , rapid advances in experimental particle - tracking techniques @xcite suggest that much of their _ nonequilibrium _ physics may soon become experimentally observable .",
    "for example , the room - temperature transition rate between the two degenerate ground - state clusters ( gsc ) of @xmath5 particles is of order @xmath6 .",
    "since their longest relaxation times should increase dramatically with increasing @xmath0 and decreasing temperature @xmath2 , it seems plausible that these model colloidal systems could soon be utilized for fundamental studies of _ nonequilibrium _ few - body statistical mechanics .    in this paper",
    ", we provide theoretical guidance for such studies by elucidating the statistical - geometrical properties and several key equilibrium and nonequilibrium phenomena in small @xmath7 clusters that mimic the systems studied in experiments @xcite .",
    "first we perform exact - enumeration studies that extend the work of refs .",
    "@xcite by obtaining all _ minimally _ @xcite mechanically stable packings of @xmath8 sticky hard spheres .",
    "then we use the `` ideally prepared ensembles '' of ground - state clusters generated by these studies as initial conditions for molecular dynamics simulations of @xmath0-particle model colloidal clusters .",
    "these simulations focus on identifying noteworthy features in their equilibrium relaxation dynamics and their preparation - protocol - dependent , nonequilibrium structure that should be observable in particle - tracking experiments .",
    "our key results are that :  * ( i ) * the fraction of `` off - pathway nuclei '' that are mechanically stable yet incompatible with close - packed crystallization grows rapidly with increasing @xmath0 ; * ( ii ) * fast temperature quenches produce ensembles retaining memory of equilibrium ensembles at higher @xmath2 , e.g.  favoring structures that are more stable against excitation because they lie in deeper energy wells : and * ( iii ) * systems exhibit nonexponential relaxation indicative of both glassy dynamics and differing stabilities of degenerate clusters with different structures .",
    "in addition to being directly relevant for experimental studies of small clusters , these results may also improve our understanding of the role such clusters play in controlling kinetic arrest in bulk systems .",
    "the interaction potential for sticky hard spheres with diameter @xmath9 is @xcite : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the energy at contact .",
    "a key feature of sticky hard - sphere clusters is that their isoenergetic , isocontacting states are in general highly degenerate .",
    "the set of all possible arrangements of @xmath0 hard spheres with @xmath12 pair contacts consists of @xmath13 nonisomorphic  macrostates . \"",
    "@xmath14 is an integer for isostatic ( @xmath15 ) and hyperstatic ( @xmath16 ) clusters @xcite wherein each sphere contacts at least 3 others , and different macrostates have different `` shapes '' , i.e.  distinct sets of interparticle distances @xmath17 ( @xmath18 $ ] ) that correspond to distinguishable inherent structures @xcite .",
    "we determine @xmath13 and find the structure of each macrostate using an updated version of the numerical procedure described at great length in ref .",
    "the main differences are that here : * ( a ) * we consider adjacency matrices @xmath19 of arbitrary rather than `` polymeric '' topology ; * ( b ) * rather than performing a sequential @xcite pass over _ all _ distinct @xmath19 , we ( following arkus et .",
    "@xcite ) use _ nauty _ @xcite to generate complete sets of nonisomorphic @xmath19 .",
    "note that * ( a ) * precludes the possibility of failing to detect clusters that do not possess hamiltonian paths , and that implementing * ( b ) * yields an orders - of - magnitude decrease in the computer time ( relative to that reported in @xcite ) required to perform exact enumeration of @xmath13 .",
    "systems interacting via sticky - hard - sphere potential ( eq .  [ eq : stickyspherepot ] ) are well known to exhibit anomalous thermodynamics @xcite . in order to simulate the @xmath2-dependent structure and dynamics of `` model '' ( but realistic ) colloidal clusters , a continuous and finite - ranged interaction potential must be introduced .",
    "we perform md simulations using a modified morse potential @xmath20 with shape and range ( figure [ fig : potential ] ) similar to the effective interactions between colloids in systems with micellar depletants @xcite ; @xmath21 the structure and dynamics of morse clusters with large @xmath3 are contact - dominated @xcite . in particular , rearrangements can be understood in terms of contact breaking and reformation . however , defining `` contact '' is ambiguous for potentials that decrease smoothly to zero .",
    "one advantage of using @xmath20 rather than @xmath22 is that it facilitates contact identification and concomitant analyses of transitions between macrostates ; @xmath23 remains finite at @xmath24 , allowing us to define contact as finite - force interaction . the shift / stretch term @xmath25 is defined to make @xmath26 continuous at @xmath27 , i.e.  @xmath28 .",

    "we have verified both that this @xmath26 is long - ranged enough to avoid the thermodynamic and dynamic anomalies that are known to arise in the @xmath39 `` baxter '' limit @xcite , and that replacement of @xmath40 with this @xmath26 has minimal effects on the structural and dynamic properties of interest here .",
    "our results should thus be scalable to both larger @xmath41 and smaller @xmath41 using ( for example ) the `` geometrical '' free energy landscape techniques of holmes - cerfon et .",
    "@xcite or the noro - frenkel extended law of corresponding states @xcite .",

    "are essentially indistinguishable.,width=288 ]    another advantage of using this @xmath20 is that it allows us to use well - defined `` ideally prepared ensembles '' ( ipe ) as initial conditions for our md simulations .",
    "we define ipe as follows : suppose a given potential has @xmath45 strain - free , energetically degenerate @xmath0-particle ground state clusters ( gsc ) with permutational entropies @xmath46 .",
    "statistical mechanics predicts that the equilibrium population fraction of each gsc at @xmath47 is @xmath48 , where @xmath49 an ipe is an ensemble of molecules containing all of ( and only the ) @xmath45 gsc , such that the population fraction of every gsc is equal to @xmath48 .",
    "our exact - enumeration studies yield the structures of these gsc @xcite ; values of @xmath46 are obtained by evaluating the symmetry of their associated adjacency matrices @xcite .",
    "we use ipe of @xmath50 @xmath0-particle molecules as initial ( @xmath47 ) conditions for md . here",
    "@xmath51 is chosen to be sufficiently large to give good statistics yet sufficiently small for computational tractability ; for the @xmath52 systems studied below we employ @xmath53 , yielding @xmath54 .",
    "using @xmath55 simply corresponds to multiplying a system s partition functions by a constant ; its value should not ( apart from statistical error ) alter any results .",
    "md simulations are performed using an in - house code that employs per - cluster parallelization .",
    "all particles have mass @xmath56 and diameter @xmath9 .",
    "each cluster is confined to a cubic cell with hard reflecting walls and side length @xmath57 chosen to give a particle number density @xmath58 in the dilute limit @xcite : here @xmath59 .",
    "thus while all particles in a given molecule interact via @xmath20 , different clusters do not interact with each other .",
    "this choice of simulation protocol and boundary conditions is motivated by the experiments @xcite , which also examined ensembles of isolated @xmath0-colloid systems in dilute solution .",

    "temperature is controlled using a strong langevin thermostat ( with damping time @xmath62 ) that mimics the strong damping experienced by colloids in a solvent . comparing to experimental values @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 @xcite gives @xmath66 .",
    "our simulations extend as long as @xmath67 ; this maps to @xmath68 , which is comparable to the duration of a typical experiment @xcite . in section [ sec : results ] , all energies , times , and temperatures are respectively expressed in units of @xmath11 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 .    to set up our studies , ipes are heated from @xmath71 to @xmath72 ( i.e.  well above the melting point ) at a rate @xmath73 .",
    "`` snapshots '' from this heating run are taken at various @xmath74 and are further equilibrated at these @xmath75 ; these equilibrated samples are used as initial conditions for our studies of fixed-@xmath2 dynamics .",
    "we characterize dynamical relaxation phenomena at these @xmath2 by examining the traversal of clusters through their various gscs using the function @xmath76 here @xmath77 is the probability that a randomly chosen cluster will _ not _ execute a transition to a different macrostate within a time interval @xmath78 .",
    "it is calculated by tracking the structure of each cluster over an `` experimental '' time interval @xmath79 , and then averaging results over all clusters and all `` start times '' @xmath80 . in equation [ eq : fmad ] , @xmath81 is the index of the macrostate in which the _ _",

    "thus @xmath77 decays monotonically from one to zero as the ensemble of clusters transition out of their initial states .",
    "preparation - protocol - dependence studies are performed by taking the @xmath86 end state of the heating run , running at @xmath86 for a period of @xmath87 in order to obtain a thoroughly equilibrated high-@xmath2 fluid state , and cooling systems back to @xmath47 at three rates : @xmath88 , and @xmath89 . during these cooling runs",
    "we monitor such quantities as the potential energy of clusters @xmath90 and the population fractions of clusters @xmath91 that correspond to each gsc .",
    "the latter are identified by comparing their adjacency matrices ( assuming particles @xmath92 contact if @xmath93 ) to those of the @xmath94 packings . in all cases ,",
    "finite-@xmath2 structures correspond either to exactly one zero - temperature gsc , or to an excited state with @xmath95 .",
    "the bulk ground states of the sticky - hard - sphere potential ( eq .   [ eq : stickyspherepot ] ) are the ( infinitely degenerate ) set @xmath96 formed by all possible stackings of perfect hexagonal planes into a close - packed crystal .",
    "local ordering within these states may be fcc , hcp , or mixed fcc / hcp .",
    "packings @xcite are finite-@xmath0 `` grains '' ( subsets ) of any member of @xmath96 .",
    "since they correspond to `` on - pathway '' nuclei that can grow into defect - free members of @xmath96 , they are expected @xcite to be be critical to understanding crystal nucleation and growth in systems with hard - core - like repulsions and short - range attractions .",
    "it is important to find all such nuclei that _ can _ form ( as opposed to those that _ do _",
    "form under specific conditions ) ; this is most conveniently achieved via exact enumeration of sticky - hard - sphere packings .    in table [ tab : summarytab ] , we report the total number of macrostates @xmath14 , as well as the the numbers of macrostates @xmath97 possessing structural features @xmath98 such as barlow order , stacking faults , and five - fold symmetric defects . the latter three structural motifs are shown in figure [ fig : motifs](a - c ) , preclude barlow order , and thus correspond to `` off - pathway '' nuclei incompatible with close - packed crystallization .",
