    "@xcite ) that @xmath33 is a tree if and only if any two splits @xmath45 in @xmath0 are _ compatible _ , i.e. , if and only if , for any two splits @xmath46 in @xmath0 , one of the four intersections @xmath47 is empty .    here",
    ", we will generalize this fact in a rather natural way as follows : given _ any _ split system @xmath0 , let @xmath48 denote the set of connected components of the so - called _ incompatibility graph _",
    "@xmath49 of @xmath0 , i.e. , the graph with vertex set @xmath9 whose edge set consists of all pairs of splits contained in @xmath9 that are _ not _ compatible .",

    "@xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",

    "let us recall first that , given any connected simple graph @xmath658 with vertex set @xmath73 and edge set @xmath659 , the graph @xmath660 with vertex set @xmath661 the disjoint union @xmath662 of the set @xmath663 of all blocks of @xmath664 and the set @xmath73 of all of its vertices , and edge set @xmath665 the set of all pairs @xmath666 with @xmath667 and @xmath668 is well - known to always be a tree ( cf .",
    "* proposition 3.1.2 ) ) . clearly , the degree @xmath669 of any vertex @xmath271 , considered as a vertex in @xmath660 , coincides with the number of blocks that contain it , and the degree @xmath670 of any block @xmath630 of @xmath664 , considered as a vertex in @xmath660 , coincides with the number of vertices it contains .    in consequence ,",
    "continuing with the notation introduced so far , every collection @xmath9 of @xmath1-splits gives rise to a tree @xmath671 with vertex set @xmath672 , the disjoint union of @xmath485 and @xmath11 , and edge set the set @xmath60 of all pairs @xmath673 with @xmath629 and @xmath674 .",
    "moreover , the canonical labelling map @xmath675 from @xmath1 into the @xmath11 can also be viewed as a labelling map from @xmath1 into the vertex set @xmath676 of @xmath677 .",
    "note further that the degree @xmath678 of any block @xmath630 of @xmath3 , considered as a vertex in @xmath57 , coincides with the number of vertices it contains .",
    "in addition , the degree @xmath679 of any vertex @xmath568 of @xmath3 , considered as a vertex in @xmath57 , coincides with the number of blocks that contain it and , hence , with the cardinality of @xmath680 , @xmath681 , @xmath682 as well as of @xmath376 . in particular ,",
    "a vertex @xmath683 is of degree larger than @xmath23 in @xmath57 if and only if it is a cut vertex of @xmath3 .    in consequence ,",
    "it is fairly obvious that we can also associate , to any system @xmath0 of @xmath1-splits , a  reduced \" tree @xmath78 which is a  proper \" @xmath1-tree : all one needs to do is ( i ) to delete all non - labeled vertices @xmath684 with @xmath685 and the pendant edges leading to them and ( ii ) to _ suppress _ all vertices of degree @xmath2 , i.e. , to replace each maximal sequence @xmath686 of distinct non - labeled vertices of @xmath57 with @xmath687 for all @xmath149 and @xmath688 for all @xmath689 by just one edge @xmath690 while simultaneously deleting all the vertices @xmath691 in between @xmath692 and @xmath693 and the edges incident with them , see also figure  [ construction ] .    thus , a block @xmath630 in @xmath74 of the form @xmath657 for some @xmath694 will be suppressed if and only if @xmath462 consists of a single split , only . otherwise , its degree @xmath695 in the  reduced \" tree @xmath78 coincides with the number of equivalence classes of the equivalence relation @xmath696 defined on @xmath1 by @xmath697 in particular , the labelling map @xmath698 sets up a bijection from @xmath1 onto the set of leaves of @xmath57 if and only if @xmath699 and the equivalence relation @xmath700 is the identity relation on @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath701 holds for all @xmath702 .     corresponding to the buneman graph @xmath40 in figure  [ example ] , where white vertices correspond to elements in the set @xmath703 and black vertices to those in @xmath704 .",
    "( b ) the @xmath1-tree @xmath85 obtained from the tree @xmath68 by deleting all non - labeled vertices @xmath684 with @xmath685 and the pendant edges leading to them and suppressing all vertices of degree @xmath2 in @xmath705 .",
    "note that the split system @xmath706 gives rise to the same @xmath1-tree.,width=302,height=132 ]      [ xtree ] suppose as above that @xmath1 is a finite set of cardinality at least @xmath2 , and that @xmath9 is a collection of @xmath1-splits .",
    "then , the following holds : + _",
    "( i ) _ the tree @xmath707 canonically associated with the graph @xmath33 is isomorphic to the graph with vertex set the disjoint union of @xmath486 and @xmath11 , and edge set @xmath708 _",
    "( ii ) _ the graph obtained from the tree @xmath677 by deleting all non - labeled vertices @xmath709 and the pendant edges leading to them as well as `` suppressing '' all non - labeled vertices of degree @xmath2 in @xmath57 is , together with the induced labelling map from @xmath1 into its vertex set , an @xmath1-tree that we denote by @xmath78 .",
    "it is canonically associated with @xmath0 and coincides with that @xmath1-tree that , according to peter buneman , is associated with @xmath0 in case @xmath0 is compatible .    _",
    "( iii ) _ furthermore , given any distinct blocks @xmath710 for which a cut vertex @xmath711 exists , one has @xmath712 that is , at least one of the three vertices @xmath713 and @xmath12 of @xmath57 must , for every such triple @xmath713 and @xmath12 , also be a vertex of the @xmath1-tree @xmath78 derived from @xmath57 .",
    "_ proof : _ the first two assertions follow immediately from our previous observations . to establish ( iii ) , note that since @xmath714 we have @xmath715 . but @xmath716 would imply that there exist two distinct vertices @xmath717 with @xmath718 and @xmath719 .",
    "let @xmath720 denote the splits for which @xmath721 and @xmath722 both hold .",
    "then @xmath723 must hold for @xmath724 and @xmath725 .",
    "this , in turn , implies that @xmath726 must hold as well as @xmath727 for every @xmath728 .",
    "hence , in view of lemma  [ incomp ] and theorem  [ blockbijection ] , @xmath729 contains at least three connected components : @xmath730 , and the connected component containing @xmath731 for some @xmath728 .",
    "+    as mentioned already above , we will explore these matters in more detail in @xcite .",
    "we will consider in particular the graph theoretical invariant , defined according to @xcite , of the _ buneman complex _",
    "@xmath732 associated to @xmath9 as defined in @xcite . and we will show that @xmath3 as well as @xmath732 can be described as a push - out in terms of the data involved in the construction of @xmath78 suggesting efficient algorithms for their computation ( see also @xcite ) .    in yet another paper",
    ", we will discuss what can be done in case the incompatibility graph @xmath49 is connected and @xmath33 is , hence , 2-connected . in particular , by directing attention towards _ cut faces _ rather than merely cut vertices of @xmath33 , we show that it may be possible even in this case to extract valuable phylogenetic information from a split system @xmath0 .",
