    "the @xmath0 form factors are relevant for the extraction of the ckm matrix element @xmath7 through the exclusive decay . while lattice qcd computation can cover only the region near @xmath8 with reasonable statistical and discretization errors , it is still useful once the experiments reach sufficiently high statistics to measure the partial decay rate in the same region . in this article",
    "we report preliminary results of our study of the @xmath0 form factors using nrqcd for heavy quark .",
    "we employ @xmath9 nrqcd for heavy quark . for the light quark the sw clover quark action",
    "is used , with the clover coefficient @xmath10 determined by mean field improved perturbation theory at one - loop order .",
    "the heavy - light vector current involved in the matrix element is renormalized to @xmath11 using the one - loop calculation of morningstar and shigemitsu @xcite , and of ishikawa @xcite including mixings with higher dimensional operators .",
    "the calculation of @xmath12 was performed at @xmath13=5.7 and 5.9 on @xmath14 and @xmath15 lattices with 232 and 222 gauge configurations , respectively .",
    "we took five different heavy quark masses covering @xmath16 and four different light quark masses ranging from @xmath17 to @xmath18 .",
    "for @xmath4 we only analyzed the @xmath19 data , so far .",
    "the momentum combinations @xmath20=@xmath21 , @xmath22=@xmath21 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath20=@xmath23 , @xmath22=@xmath21 in units of @xmath25 are considered at @xmath26 , which is around @xmath17 .",
    "let us first present the results for @xmath27 , for which the soft pion theorem @xmath3 in the chiral limit provides an important check of the lattice calculation .",
    "the @xmath6 dependence of @xmath28 @xmath27 @xmath29 @xmath30 and a comparison with @xmath28 @xmath31 @xmath29 @xmath30 is shown in fig .",
    "[ softpion ] .",
    "the data for @xmath27 at two @xmath13 values show nice scaling , while a clear disagreement with @xmath31 is observed , confirming the point made by the hiroshima group @xcite .",
    "= 7.0 cm    the chiral ( soft pion ) limit is not taken for the points given in the plot , which is a possible reason of the violation of the soft pion relation .",
    "we find , however , that the light quark mass dependence of @xmath27 is consistent with a constant within statistical error , and a polynomial chiral extrapolation in @xmath32 and @xmath33 gives a consistent result . with the present statistics , we are not able to fit our data with both @xmath34 and @xmath32 in the fitting function .    another possible reason for the disagreement with",
    "the soft pion relation is the large uncertainty in the matching constants .",
    "since the vector and axial vector heavy - light currents are involved on the two sides of the equality , perturbative errors in the matching between the continuum and lattice operators could be important .",
    "naively this error is @xmath35 , and hence should be small at @xmath36 6.0 .",
    "nonetheless , the large one - loop correction in the renormalization constant @xmath37 suggests that there could be large higher order corrections .    in order to see how such higher order effect contributes , we computed the ratio of the renormalization constants @xmath38 nonperturbatively in the static limit , using the chiral ward - takahashi identity @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 denote light - light axial - current and pseudoscalar density , with @xmath42 the renormalization factor for @xmath40 , and @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the heavy - light ( static - light in this particular case ) currents .",
    "we performed simulations on a @xmath14 lattice at @xmath45 following the methods of maiani - martinelli @xcite .",
    "for the operator @xmath46 we took a heavy - light meson interpolation operator with wall source .",
    "the clover coefficient @xmath47 for the light quark was chosen to be the nonperturbative value from @xcite    combining our result for @xmath48 from ( 1 ) with the nonperturbative value of @xcite for @xmath42 , we obtained @xmath49 to be compared with the perturbative result @xmath50 .",
    "we find that the nonperturbative value for @xmath38 is about 20% smaller than the corresponding one - loop result . while this explains part of the discrepancy between @xmath31 and @xmath27 , the reduction is not sufficient to remove the disagreement seen in fig .",
    "[ softpion ] .    in our study of the renormalization constant",
    ", the light - light and static - light current did not include corrections from higher dimensional operators .",
    "since these corrections are known to give a large contribution in the calculation of @xmath51 @xcite , it would be important to perform a study of renormalization constant with improved curents .",
    "we next study the @xmath52 and @xmath6 dependence of the form factor @xmath4 . for the large @xmath52 region ,",
    "the form factor @xmath4 should be well approximated by the pole dominance model with the @xmath5 pole , since @xmath5 is almost degenerate with @xmath53 in the heavy quark limit and the pole is very close to @xmath1 .",
    "the pole model predicts @xmath54 where the coefficient @xmath55 is written in terms of the dimensionless @xmath56 coupling @xmath57 and the @xmath5 meson decay constant @xmath58 as @xmath59 .",
    "figure  [ pole ] shows our data for @xmath60 near @xmath1 for @xmath61 at @xmath19 .",
    "we find that the pole fit indeed explains the data quite well for each value of the heavy quark mass .",
    "= 7.0 cm    the heavy quark scaling is also predicted within the pole dominance model .",

    "[ cfp ] together with a curve representing @xmath65 .",
    "we confirm that the heavy quark scaling is nicely satisfied .",
    "furthermore , from this fit , we obtain @xmath57=0.33(4 ) , which is consistent with the value extracted from @xmath66 @xcite @xmath67 and with the recent lattice study @xcite @xmath68 .",
    "we consider that the problem of the soft pion relation should be resolved before a prediction of the @xmath0 form factors from lattice qcd can be made .",
    "we have investigated the possibility that the perturbative matching contains a large systematic error , and found that a nonperturbative value shows a non - negligible difference from the one - loop result .",
    "checking the @xmath52 dependence and the @xmath6 scaling of @xmath4 is a necessary step toward a prediction of partial decay rate .",
    "we have found that the pole dominance model provides an excellent way to fit the observed shape of @xmath4 in the large @xmath52 region .",
