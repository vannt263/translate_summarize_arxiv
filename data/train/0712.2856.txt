    "anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) are a class of pulsars with observed x - ray luminosities in excess of what can be provided by rotational spin - down .",
    "observationally , they possess extremely large inferred surface magnetic fields ( @xmath2  g ) , exhibit a variety of variable behaviour such as x - ray bursts , timing glitches and changes to their flux and spectrum , and are now known to be emitters of optical and infrared ( ir ) , and in some cases even radio radiation .",
    "it is believed that they , like the soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) , are magnetars : isolated neutron stars powered by the decay of enormous magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "the resulting effects of the magnetic field on the crust and magnetosphere produce the observational signatures found in axps and sgrs .",

    "1048.1@xmath05937  is an axp with a particularly unique history . prior to 2004 ,",
    "this pulsar was highly rotationally unstable , so that phase coherence could only been maintained for months at a time @xcite . during 2001 - 2002 ,",
    "1e  1048.1@xmath05937  underwent two prolonged flux `` flares '' ( not to be confused with sgr giant flares ) that were unlike behaviour seen previously in any other magnetar .",
    "the time - resolved flux increases took place over @xmath3weeks , and the gradual decay of the larger flare lasted years @xcite . at the same time , erratic torque variability , x - ray spectral variablity @xcite , sgr - like bursts , and a near - ir flux enhancement @xcite occurred .",
    "thus , we proposed for simultaneous monitoring observations with the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ and the _ hubble space telescope _ in 2006 .",
    "between 2004 - 2006 , 1e  1048.1@xmath05937  appeared to be in a state of relative quiescence .",

[ [ axp - emission - models ] ] axp emission models + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the source of the anti - correlation between pulsed fraction and total flux is not obvious . in principle , it could be the result of a growing hot spot on the magnetar surface , produced by either changing internal processes , or changes in returning magnetospheric currents .",
    "this is complicated by such complex effects as surface thermal emission @xcite , light bending and radiative beaming , and magnetospheric scattering @xcite .",
    "the observed hardness - intensity correlation is predicted by the twisted magnetic field model @xcite , and can also possibly be explained by surface thermal emission @xcite .    an alternative model for axp emission is accretion from a fallback debris disk around an ordinary pulsar @xcite , in which both the pulsar s spin - down rate ( fig .  [ fig : timing]_b _ ) and x - ray luminosity ( fig .",
    "[ fig : timing]_d _ ) are heavily dependent on the mass accretion rate .",
    "@xcite showed that for a pulsar undergoing spin down , we would expect @xmath10 .",
    "however , we find that the factor of @xmath110 variability in @xmath11 between 2002 - 2004 was not reflected in a factor of @xmath1200 change in x - ray luminosity as expected ; in fact , the unabsorbed flux changed by merely @xmath36@xmath12 , and asynchronously with @xmath11 .

    "these new observations showed that the optical / ir flux may in fact be correlated with x - ray flux , contrary to what was previously suggested @xcite .",
    "near - ir variability is seen as correlated with x - rays in another axp @xcite , but appears uncorrelated in two other cases @xcite .",
    "such inconsistent behaviour is puzzling for the accretion disk model , since near - ir radiation is thought to be closely tied to x - ray emission via reprocessing of the x - rays in the disk .",
    "optical / ir emission from magnetars has been attributed to high - energy processes ( such as curvature or ion cyclotron emission ) occurring in the magnetosphere @xcite . regardless , more frequent monitoring of axp variability will be required in order to set constraints on optical / ir models .",

    "from @xmath310 yrs of multiwavelenth observations , it is apparent that all spin and radiative activity from 1e  1048.1@xmath05937  prior to 2004 can be linked to the large flares of 2001 - 2002 , and that this axp was in a relative quiescence between 2004 - 2006 , which ended in march 2007 with another flaring event .",
    "we speculate that the observed behaviour , such as the varying x - ray flux anti - correlated with pulsed fraction and correlated with hardness , may be consistent with current magnetar scenarios ."
