    "we depict in fig .",
    "[ fig : scale ] the @xmath188 dependence of @xmath192 which shows that the extrapolation uncertainty is at a tolerable level ( @xmath193% ) being much smaller than the normalization uncertainty .",
    "the corresponding extrapolation uncertainty for the processes with same sign leptons is smaller by a factor of 2 because of the qcd background is small .",
    "altogether the total expected uncertainty in the estimated number of background events has two sources : the _ theoretical _ uncertainty associated to the extrapolations from the calibration region ( @xmath194 ) and the _ statistical _ error associated to the determination of the background cross section in the calibration region ( @xmath195 ) .",
    "this last one is slightly different for the case of light or no light higgs boson because of the slightly different number of events from the sm irreducible background . assuming an integrated luminosity of 100 fb@xmath196 we find @xmath197 where we denoted by the superscript `` lin '' ( `` non - lin '' ) the case with ( without ) a light higgs boson .",
    "in addition to these uncertainties considered here there are also experimental systematic uncertainties , which are sizable for the higgs boson searches @xcite , however they do require a full detector simulation which is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "in order to obtain the attainable sensitivity to deviations of the sm predictions of the quartic gauge boson couplings we assumed an integrated luminosity of @xmath198 fb@xmath196 and that the observed number of events in the different scenarios is compatible with the background expectations for the choice * c1 * of the renormalization and factorization scales both in the signal ( @xmath199 ) and in the calibration ( @xmath200 ) regions , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath201 where we denote the process @xmath202 by @xmath203 os and the sum of @xmath204 and @xmath205 by @xmath203 ss .",
    "deviations from the sm prediction for the four gauge boson vertices manifest themselves as a difference between the number of observed events and the number of background events estimated from the extrapolation of the background measured in the calibration region ( @xmath206 ) , that is , @xmath207 where @xmath208 .",
    "notice that ( [ hypo ] ) implies that we are assuming that no departure of the sm predictions has been observed neither in the control region nor in the signal one .",
    "the statistical error of the number of anomalous events is @xmath209 where the first term is the statistical error of the measured number of events in the signal region and the second term is the error in the determination of the background in the signal region due to the statistical error of the background measurement in the calibration region , @xmath195 .",
    "the extrapolation uncertainty introduces an additional error @xmath210 both errors can be assumed to be gaussian and we combine then in quadrature .    given our definition of the signal ( [ sig : def ] ) , the errors ( [ err : stat])([err : th ] ) , and the parametrization of the cross section in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigmatot ] ) we can easily obtain the attainable limits on any combination of quartic anomalous coefficients .",
    "we exhibit in the upper panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : contours ] the 99% cl exclusion region in the plane @xmath211 versus @xmath212 ( left ) and @xmath213 versus @xmath214 ( right ) for each channel @xmath215 independently , and for the combination of both ( full region ) .",
    "as we can see the same sign processes present a very strong correlation between both couplings while the correlation is somewhat smaller for the case of the processes with opposite sign leptons . as a consequence ,",
    "the final allowed regions are rather `` compact '' and meaningful sensitivity bounds can be derived .    in the lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : contours ] we plot the @xmath216 as a function of individual couplings , under the assumption that only one anomalous parameter is non  vanishing .",
    "from this we find that for the case with a light higgs boson of @xmath95 gev @xmath217 at 99% cl . in models without a light higgs boson we get the following 99% cl bounds @xmath218    these results represent an improvement of more than one order of magnitude over the present sensitivity from indirect effects in low energy observables ( [ eq : lel ] ) and ( [ eq : lenl ] ) . notwithstanding , for the case in which a light higgs boson is found and the gauge theory is linearly realized , they do not reach the expected natural order of magnitude @xmath219 for new physics scale above 1 tev . on the other hand , for scenarios without",
    "a light higgs boson a natural order of magnitude of the anomalous couplings @xmath220 in a fundamental gauge theory is @xmath221 @xcite , since the quartic anomalous interactions can be generated by tree diagrams .",
    "thus , we might expect that the size of the @xmath222 s should be of the order of @xmath223 which is close to the attainable sensitivity that we obtain from our analysis .",
    "it is also interesting to notice that the achievable sensitivity at the lhc is close to the recently derived lower bounds based on the usual analytical properties associated with causal , unitary theories @xcite .",
    "the lack of observation of an anomalous coupling @xmath213 and @xmath214 below that bound , would indicate the breakdown of some of these basic properties of the @xmath77-matrix .",
    "in particular , as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , since string theory is designed to produce @xmath77-matrix with these properties and therefore , the experimental verification of those bounds could be use to falsify string theory .",
