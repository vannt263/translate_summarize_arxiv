    "we also resampled the _",
    "irs data to a resolution of @xmath42 to conserve computer time .    to create 3-d optically - thin disk models",

    "this software ( available online at http://asd.gsfc.nasa.gov/marc.kuchner/home.html ) synthesizes images of optically thin dust disks based on the @xcite empirical model of the solar zodiacal cloud as observed by cobe dirbe .",
    "the grain size and inner and outer radius of each modeled disk component were determined by the best fit to the _ spitzer _ irs spectrum .      for our first models we used a single component of silicate dust grains of size @xmath43 distributed from an inner radius , @xmath44 , to an outer radius , @xmath45 .",

    "we examined 100 grain sizes , @xmath43 , ranging from 0.05  2.5 @xmath10 and used the astronomical silicate emissivities from @xcite .",
    "we used a non - linear least squares fitting routine to determine the best fit inner and outer disk radii for each grain size .",
    "the best - fit single - component disk model , shown in figure [ bestfit_singlecomponent_figure ] , consists of 1.0 @xmath10 grains distributed from the grain sublimation radius ( @xmath47 au ) to 189 au .",
    "as you might imagine , this single component does a poor job of fitting the complexities of the _ spitzer _ irs spectrum .",

    "an additional disk component , either of different composition , grain size , or location , appears necessary to fit the _",

    "our optically - thin models are defined by 10 adjustable parameters : inner and outer radii of the outer disk ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 ) , inner and outer radii of the inner disk ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 ) , grain size in the outer disk ( @xmath53 ) , scale height of the outer disk ( @xmath54 ) , scale height of the inner disk ( @xmath55 ) , surface density scaling factor of the outer disk ( @xmath56 ) , surface density scaling factor of the inner disk ( @xmath57 ) , and a common position angle for both disk components ( pa ) .",

    "we assumed a fixed disk inclination of @xmath66 .",
    "we examined 237 values of disk scale heights ranging from @xmath67 to @xmath68 for both the inner and outer disks .",
    "we examined position angles from 0 to 180@xmath12 in 1@xmath12 increments .",
    "we calculated the keck nuller null leakage and vlti - midi visibility for all combinations of disk scale heights and position angle to find the best - fit model a , the parameters for which are listed in table [ bestfitstable ] . to calculate the keck nuller null leakage and vlti - midi visibility , we used a software suite that we designed to model these instruments",

    "the best simultaneous fit to the keck nuller null leakage and vlti - midi visibility , shown in black , illustrates that model a does not satisfactorily reproduce both interferometric responses simultaneously .",
    "the keck null leakage is well - fit , but the vlti - midi visibility is underestimated by a factor of @xmath69 , indicating that this dust disk model is too extended along the vlti - midi baseline .",
    "figure [ bestfit2comp_noshortlambda_figure ] also shows in gray the response corresponding to the best fit to the midi data alone , which does not produce a satisfactory keck null leakage .",
    "figure [ response_vs_pa_figure ] explains the source of the problem .",

    "the keck nuller response of model a ( black triangles ) crosses the measured keck null leakage ( black line ) at a position angle of @xmath71 . to fit both data sets , the 10 @xmath10 responses for the model would need to intersect their respective measured values at a single position angle .",
    "the top panel in this figure clearly shows that this does not happen ; there is no single position angle for the model that works for both the keck and vlti - midi data .",
    "figure [ response_vs_pa_figure ] also reveals how a new model can remedy the problem .",
    "the position angles of the maximum in the vlti - midi response and the minimum in the keck response are fixed and correspond to the alignment of the instrument s projected baseline with the disk axis of rotation .",
    "so to improve our fit to the interferometric data , we must change the model so that we broaden the widths of the maximum in the vlti - midi response and minimum in the keck response ; we must make the model more azimuthally symmetric .",
    "we attempted to accomplish this improvement manually by increasing the scale height of the disk models .",
    "however , making this change alone reduces the maximum vlti - midi visibility of the model until it no longer reaches the measured value .",
    "so to compensate , we also reduced the outer radius of the inner disk ; we forced the inner and outer radii of the inner disk to 0.54 au and 4 au , respectively , and re - ran the fitting procedure .",
    "we call the resulting best - fit  model b. \" the bottom panel in figure [ response_vs_pa_figure ] shows that the 10 @xmath10 interferometric responses of model b cross the measured values approximately simultaneously at a single position angle of 122@xmath12 , indicated with a dotted vertical line in the figure .    although model b does not fit the _ spitzer _",
    "irs spectrum as well as model a , it still qualitatively reproduces the spectrum s major features , as shown in the top panel in figure [ bestfit2comp_noshortlambda_figure_7 ] .",
    "the middle and bottom panels of figure [ bestfit2comp_noshortlambda_figure_7 ] show that these changes significantly improve the fit to the interferometric data ; model b is consistent with both the keck null leakage and vlti - midi visibility .",
    "figure [ image_figure ] shows a simulated image of our model b circumstellar disk at 10 @xmath10 with 1 mas pixel resolution . the inner disk of large dust grains , truncated at 30.5 mas ( 4 au ) , is the brightest feature of our model .",
    "the outer disk extends from 53 mas to @xmath179200 mas , beyond the range of the figure .",

    "@xcite found the best fit to the 2.2 micron continuum visibility measurements using a narrow ring 0.24 au in radius , well within the dust sublimation radius , and noted that this continuum may result from hot dust interior to the sublimation radius which is shielded from stellar radiation or from free - free emission from an inner gas disk @xcite .",
    "we calculated the k - band visibility of our model b for the three baseline orientations used by @xcite and checked these calculations with the visibility modeling tool provided by nexsci .",

    "because the keck nuller and vlti - midi do not resolve these extreme inner portions of the disk , the k - band observations may probe a different structure than what the n - band observations probe .",
    "@xcite use photometric data to estimate that the excess continuum contributes 25% of the total flux at 2.2 microns . by estimating the stellar flux at 2.2 microns and modeling the continuum flux source as a blackbody at 1500 k ( dust at the sublimation temperature )",
    ", we calculate that the continuum source s contribution at n - band would be no larger than 1.9 jy .",
    "this contribution is a factor of @xmath175 less than the flux from the blackbody component of our best fit two - component optically thin disk models .",
    "this disparity suggests that an additional blackbody component is necessary beyond what @xcite model . additionally ,",
    "our model a and model b blackbody components contribute only 1.4 jy and 3.4 jy of flux at 2.2 microns , respectively , less than the 3.6 jy of excess continuum flux calculated by @xcite .",
    "perhaps a three - component model , with an outer disk of small silicate grains , an inner disk of large grains , and a continuum source interior to the dust sublimation radius ( shielded hot dust or free - free emission from a gas disk ) , will be necessary to explain all of the interferometric and spectral data sets .",
    "motivated by the @xcite and @xcite circumstellar disk models , we explored an alternative edge - on disk geometry consisting of a blackbody midplane layer sandwiched between two identical optically - thin surface layers of small dust grains .",
    "the surface layers are thin ; they have a very small scale height and are unresolved in the direction perpendicular to the midplane .",

    "for the dust grains to be significantly affected by gas drag , @xmath102 . substituting @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath105 is the gas temperature , and @xmath106 is the mass of an @xmath107 molecule , we find that entraining a 1 @xmath10 grain in the gas would require @xmath108 assuming a gas temperature of 1400 k at a circumstellar distance of 5 au , near the vicinity of the inner disk , the gas density required to stop a 1 @xmath10 grain is @xmath109 @xmath96 .",
    "we conclude that if the disk around 51 oph is comprised of an inner birth ring and an outer disk of ejected grains , then the gas density in the 51 oph disk must be less than @xmath17100 times the gas density of @xmath2 pic @xcite at a circumstellar distance of @xmath175 au .",
    "the outer disk in model b has a scale height at least @xmath174 times larger than the scale height of the inner disk .",
    "so the small grains at high orbital inclinations in the outer disk seem unlikely to have originated from the thin inner disk in our simple model .",
    "such small grains can not easily be perturbed to high - inclination orbits by hidden planets either , because of their short lifetimes compared to secular time scales .",
    "the difference in scale heights between the two components of our model suggests to us that 51 oph may have an unobserved sub - disk of larger bodies on inclined orbits in the inner regions of the disk .",
    "the limited @xmath110 coverage and resolution of the keck and vlti - midi observations could easily keep such a sub - disk hidden from our observations .",
    "this sub - disk might be analogous to the x - pattern , or  warp \" imaged by @xcite in the @xmath2 pictoris disk .",
    "the large bodies in this sub - disk could launch the small grains onto inclined orbits , just as @xcite suggested occurs in the @xmath2 pictoris disk .      here",
    "we discuss two possibilities that might complicate our interpretation of the mid - ir interferometry of 51 oph : a ) the disk composition or structure is more complex than can be represented by our models , or b ) the disk has changed during the four year interval between vlti - midi and keck observations .",
    "the chemical composition of the 51 oph dust disk is not well - known .",
    "our models assumed astronomical silicates only , and ignored the possibility of a more complex composition .",
    "a detailed model of the 51 oph disk composition , along the lines of @xcite for example , which we leave for future work , would help to further refine our models .",
    "the disk geometry could also be more complex than our models can capture .",
    "as previously discussed , there are a number of observations which suggest that an inner circumstellar disk is near edge - on in the 51 oph system .",
    "our optically - thin models of the dust disk assume an outer disk which is coplanar , but the 51 oph disk inclination may be more complex .",
    "some debris disks show warps or sub - disks at different inclinations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it is possible that our assumption of coplanar disks does not allow model a , which best fits the _ spitzer _ irs spectrum , to simultaneously fit the vlti - midi visibility and keck null leakage .",
    "the 51 oph disk geometry may also have changed between observations .",
    "the blowout time for small grains originating from a belt of material at 1 au is on the order of a single dynamical time ( only a few years ) .",
    "so the outer disk could evolve significantly within the four years between keck and vlti - midi observations via a recent collisional event ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "additionally , 51 oph s inner disk could feature complex resonant structures , such as clumps or rings due to the presence of planets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which rotate in and out of view on a dynamical timescale .",
    "a comparison of the _ spitzer _ irs spectrum shown in figure [ bestfit2comp_noshortlambda_figure ] and the iso spectrum published in @xcite reveals that the 51 oph disk may have changed significantly in the 8 years between spectral observations . the silicate emission feature in the _ spitzer _ irs spectrum peaks at 10 @xmath10 , whereas the iso spectrum peaks at 10.5 to 11 @xmath10 .",
    "the slope of the right side of the silicate emission feature is also noticeably steeper in the _ spitzer _ irs spectrum ; estimated slopes of the right side of the 10 @xmath10 silicate emission feature are @xmath111 jy @xmath112 and @xmath113 jy @xmath112 for iso and _ spitzer _ observations , respectively .",
    "these differences indicate that the 51 oph disk may have had larger grains at the time of the iso observations .",
    "finally , the flux longward of 20 @xmath10 in the iso spectrum is @xmath69 jy less than the spitzer irs spectrum , possibly because there were fewer cold grains at the time of the iso observations .",
    "we observed the 51 oph disk at n - band using the keck interferometer operating in nulling mode . we combined the observed keck null leakage with vlti - midi visibility data and the _ spitzer _ irs spectrum and simultaneously modeled all three data sets .",
    "we experimented with a variety of optically - thin dust cloud models and also an edge - on optically - thick disk model .",
    "the _ spitzer _",
    "irs spectrum ruled out the single - component optically - thin model , while the interferometric data ruled out our optically - thick model .",
    "our preferred model consists of two separate populations of large and small grains .",
    "the three data sets are best simultaneously fit by our model b ( table [ bestfitstable ] ) .",
    "this model , shown in figure [ bestfit2comp_noshortlambda_figure_7 ] , contains a disk of larger grains that extends from the grain sublimation radius out to @xmath0 au and a disk of @xmath114 grains that extends from @xmath115 au to @xmath1 au .",
    "this model may be consistent with an inner  birth \" disk of continually colliding parent bodies .",
    "the large grains ( @xmath116 50 @xmath10 ) produced by the parent bodies make up the inner disk , while the small grains ( @xmath117 50 @xmath10 ) are blown outward and eventually ejected from the system by radiation pressure .",
    "the large scale height of the outer disk compared to the inner disk suggests that the small grains which compose the outer disk may originate from an unseen inclined sub - disk or from a population of inclined cometary bodies .",
    "although the 51 oph disk seems puzzling at first , perhaps it is not so strange after all .",
    "the distribution of grain sizes in our models is not unique to the 51 oph system , but has been observed in the @xmath2 pictoris @xcite , vega @xcite , and au microscopii @xcite disks .",
    "our models suggest that the 51 oph disk may be another member of a class of debris disks which exhibit similar dust distributions .",
    "our models also indicate that there may be two sources of dust at different inclinations around 51 oph .",
    "these models , together with previous observations of variable absorption features @xcite which may be due to transient infalling bodies suggest that the 51 oph dust disk may well be an example of a @xmath2 pictoris - like system .",
