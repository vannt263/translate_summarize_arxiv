    "the estimation of a probability from a set of observations is one of the most basic problems in statistics , with many applications in signal processing and related fields .",
    "one commonly used technique is inverse binomial sampling ( also termed negative - binomial monte carlo ) .",
    "given a sequence of independent bernoulli trials with probability of success @xmath0 , this technique consists in observing the sequence until a given number @xmath1 of successes is obtained .",
    "the resulting number of trials is denoted as @xmath2 .",
    "the uniformly minimum variance unbiased estimator of @xmath0 , for @xmath3 , is @xcite @xmath4 for @xmath5 the mean square error ( mse ) of is known to satisfy @xmath6/p^2",
    "< 1/({n}-2)$ ] irrespective of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "recent works @xcite @xcite have shown that , for the modified estimator @xmath7 , the confidence level associated to a relative interval of the form @xmath8 $ ] also satisfies a lower bound irrespective of @xmath0 , for @xmath5 and a certain range of @xmath9 values .",
    "a similar result also holds for the estimator , albeit for a reduced range of @xmath9 values @xcite .",
    "this paper analyzes the mean absolute error ( mae ) of the estimator , for @xmath3 .",
    "although the mae is less often used than the mse , it is a more natural error measure , and has several advantages @xcite @xcite .",
    "it is simpler , it has a clearer meaning , and it is less sensitive to outlying values .",
    "apparently , its lack of use is in large part motivated by the analytical difficulty associated to the absolute value @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "let @xmath10 and @xmath11 for @xmath3 , the mae of the estimator satisfies the following .",
    "@xmath12    given @xmath1 , the probability function of @xmath2 , denoted as @xmath13 $ ] , is @xmath14 the corresponding distribution function is denoted as @xmath15 .",

    "the limit result follows from the poisson theorem @xcite .",
    "let @xmath23 $ ] . to prove , it is noted that all values @xmath24 give @xmath25 . from , @xmath26}{\\partial p } = 2 \\binom{{{n}_0}-1}{{n}-1 } p^{{n}-2 } ( 1-p)^{{{n}_0}-{n } }",
    "( { n}-1-{{n}_0}p),\\ ] ] which is negative for @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , it is sufficient to consider @xmath0 restricted to the set @xmath27 ; and @xmath28 defining @xmath29 the inequality is equivalent to @xmath30 .",
    "it follows from , , and that @xmath31    equation has the same form as ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq .  ( 17 ) ) .",
    "however , the result in the cited reference which establishes the nonnegativity of @xmath32 is not applicable , and a separate analysis is required .",
    "the variable @xmath32 can be written as @xmath33 with @xmath34 for @xmath35 , @xmath36 reduces to @xmath37 , and is thus positive . for @xmath5 , using the inequality @xcite @xmath38 in , @xmath39 let @xmath40 denote the right - hand side of . computing @xmath41 as if @xmath42 were a continuous variable and using the inequality @xmath43 gives @xmath44 thus @xmath45 for any @xmath46 , which implies that all the coefficients @xmath36 are positive .",
    "therefore , @xmath30 for @xmath3 .",
    "this establishes .",
    "the positivity of @xmath36 for all @xmath47 , @xmath3 implies that the values of @xmath48 corresponding to @xmath49 , @xmath50 form a decreasing sequence .",
    "together with the negative character of @xmath51/\\partial p$ ] for @xmath52 , this implies that @xmath53 is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath0 .",
    "the result above allows the estimation of a probability @xmath0 with a prescribed value of the normalized mae , @xmath53 .",
    "this value is guaranteed irrespective of the unknown @xmath0 .",
    "for example , if a normalized mae not exceeding @xmath54 is desired , @xmath55 suffices , according to .",
    "the behaviour of the normalized mae as a funcion of @xmath0 is depicted in figure [ fig : mae_p_fs ] , with solid lines .",
    "the discontinuity of the derivative at the points @xmath56 , @xmath57 ( see proof of theorem ) can be clearly observed , specially for low @xmath1 and large @xmath0 .",
    "figure [ fig : bound ] shows the bound as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "the bound for the normalized root mean square error ( rmse ) , @xmath58)^{1/2}/p$ ] , is also shown for comparison .",
    "both error measures are seen to have the same type of behaviour , with mae lower than rmse .",
    "+     +    it is interesting to compare the bound with the normalized mae resulting from a fixed sample size @xmath19 .",
    "this is obtained from ( * ? ? ?",

    "since the average sample size in inverse binomial sampling is @xmath61 , the comparison is restricted to probabilities @xmath0 such that @xmath61 is an integer value , and the sample size @xmath19 in the fixed case is taken equal to this value .",
    "the resulting fixed - size normalized mae is shown in figure [ fig : mae_p_fs ] with dashed lines .",
    "dividing by with @xmath62 , it is easily seen that , for @xmath63 , the mae with inverse binomial sampling is asymptotically @xmath64 times larger than the mae with fixed size .",
    "this value is close to @xmath65 except for very small values of @xmath1 .",
    "this is observed in figure [ fig : mae_p_fs ] , which also shows that the mae ratio is approximately maintained for all values of @xmath0 .",
    "it is thus concluded that , in order to guarantee a given normalized mae , inverse binomial sampling gives an average sample size that is only slightly larger than the sample size that would be necessary in the fixed case ( which is a function of the unknown @xmath0 ) .",
    "the mae in inverse binomial sampling has been analyzed .",
    "it has been shown that the estimator guarantees a certain value of the normalized mae .",
    "this result is analogous to that known for the mse , and allows to select a value of @xmath1 that meets a prescribed error level irrespective of @xmath0 ."
