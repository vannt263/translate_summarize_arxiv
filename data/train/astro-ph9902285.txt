    "in several clusters of galaxies one observes a soft @xmath4-ray excess towards the central regions .",
    "this excess is interpreted as being due to hot intracluster gas ( 10@xmath5 - 10@xmath6 k ) with a cooling time less than the hubble time ( fabian 1994 ) .",
    "this gas cools and falls quasi - hydrostatically into the center of the cluster potential well ( e.g. fabian , nulsen & canizares 1984 , 1991 ; sarazin 1988 ) .",
    "+ indeed , radial profiles of temperature and density in the intracluster gas inferred from @xmath4-ray observations show that cooler denser gas ( 10@xmath7 - 10@xmath5 k ) is present in the central region of the cluster ( johnstone , fabian , edge & thomas 1992 ) .",
    "typical mass accretion rates inferred in these cooling flow clusters are @xmath8 100 m@xmath9 year@xmath10 and even higher in some cases ( fabian 1994 ) . thus cooling flows in clusters of galaxies",
    "deposit large quantities of cool gas around the central galaxy , which is still continuing to grow today .",
    "recent extreme ultra - violet ( euv ) observations revealed the presence of important amounts of a warm euv emitting gas in the cooling flow cluster a1795 ( lieu , mittaz , bowyer et al .",
    "1996a , 1996b ) .",
    "+ the final evolution of the cool gas is not clear .",
    "it may just accumulate as cool dense clouds , indeed white , fabian , johnstone et al .",
    "( 1991 ) have observed a large amount of cold @xmath4-ray absorbing matter distributed over the inner few 100 kpc of some clusters of galaxies and came to the conclusion that the absorbing component is likely to be either atomic or molecular ( mainly hydrogen ) .",
    "moreover , they suggested that the gas is very cold ( @xmath11 k ) and that it makes up a significant fraction of the total mass , which has cooled out of the cooling accretion flow during the lifetime of the cluster .",
    "+ fabian , johnstone & daines ( 1994 ) have postulated that dust can form in the cold clouds embedded in cooling flows , which would explain why the clouds are almost undetectable outside the @xmath4-ray wavelength range . however , the nature of the absorbing material remains uncertain .",
    "the limits imposed by 21-cm and @xmath2 observations , suggest that it is unlikely that significant amounts of cold gas can remain undetectable . on the other hand jaffe & bremer ( 1997 ) , using k - band spectroscopy , have found that the inner few kpc of central cluster galaxies in cooling flows have strong emission in the @xmath0(1 - 0)s(1 ) line .",
    "this is not seen in a comparable sample of non cooling flow galaxies .",
    "jaffe & bremer ( 1997 ) suggest that it is likely that a large mass of additional molecular material is in the cooling flow , producing the soft @xmath4-ray absorption .",
    "at least a fraction of the cool gas must reach the inner regions of the central cluster galaxies , where it could accumulate into molecular clouds and subsequently form stars ( cardiel , gorgas & aragn - salamenca 1998 ) . + the metallicity of a cluster seems to be correlated with the presence of a cooling flow ( allen & fabian 1998 ) .",
    "mushotzky & lowenstein ( 1997 ) showed that most of the enrichment of the intercluster medium occured at high redshifts .",
    "this is consistent with the semi - analytic models of galaxy formation ( kauffmann & charlot 1998 ) , which find indeed that the metal enrichment occurs at @xmath12 . in this",
    "context molecules such as @xmath2 can subsequently be formed in the gaseous medium .",
    "the molecular gas can cool down to very low temperatures within the intra - cluster environment as has been suggested by ferland , fabian & johnstone ( 1994 ) .",
    "+ odea , baum , maloney et al .",
    "( 1994 ) searched for molecular gas , by looking for @xmath2 emission lines in a heterogeneous sample of five radio - loud galaxies ( three of which are in cooling flow clusters ) , using the swedish - eso submillimeter telescope in the frequency ranges of 80 - 116 ghz and 220 - 260 ghz .",
    "a positive detection of @xmath2 has been made in two of the galaxies : pks 0634 - 206 , a classical double radio galaxy , and possibly in ngc 4696 .",
    "they come to the conclusion that in order to have escaped detection the gas has to be very cold , close to the temperature of the cosmic background radiation ( cbr ) .",
    "odea , baum , maloney et al . ( 1994 ) estimated also the expected temperature of the clouds by comparing the @xmath4-ray heating with the cooling rate for molecular gas . for the latter they adopted the cooling rate calculated by goldsmith & langer ( 1978 ) , which includes line cooling from both molecular and atomic species likely to be abundant in molecular clouds .",
    "they thus assumed that the clouds have a metallicity similar to solar neighbourhood clouds .",
    "however , the goldsmith & langer cooling rates are valid in the range @xmath8 20 - 60 k , below @xmath8 20 k they are no longer reliable .",
    "in addition the possible role of @xmath1 as a cooling agent was not taken into account .",
    "therefore , the conclusion of odea , baum , maloney et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , that the minimum temperature of the clouds is in the range 20 - 30 k is certainly questionable .",
    "+ recently , bridges & irwin ( 1998 ) have observed molecular gas in the perseus cooling flow galaxy ngc 1275 and have mapped the central arcminute of this galaxy with the james clerk maxwell telescope in @xmath13 . assuming a galactic conversion between @xmath2 intensity and the molecular @xmath0 gas mass they inferred a total mass m@xmath14 m@xmath9 .",
    "they argue that the reason why @xmath2 has been detected in ngc 1275 is that the radio emission heats up the molecules to a detectable temperature .",
    "indeed , ngc 1275 happens to have one of the strongest radio core of any cooling flow central galaxy . without the heating of the radio emission",
    "the gas would stay at much lower temperatures and thus escape detection .",
    "+ the aim of this paper is to investigate the minimum temperature achievable by clouds in cooling flows by improving the analysis done by odea , baum , maloney et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , in particular by considering clouds made of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 molecules and by computing cooling functions which are more appropriate for temperatures below 20 k. we do not discuss the different pathways for forming @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 molecules . @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be formed at the early epoch of the recombination of the hydrogen ( see lepp & shull 1984 , puy , alecian , le bourlot et al . 1993 ) , whereas @xmath2 formation can be triggered by the radiative association of @xmath15 with @xmath16 after the first star formation .",
    "+ the paper is organised as follows : in sect .",
    "2 we recall the effects of @xmath4-ray heating on the clouds using the results of glassgold & langer ( 1973 ) and odea , baum , maloney et al . (",
    "1994 ) . in sect .",
    "3 we calculate the molecular cooling due to @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively , through the transition between the ground state and the first rotational level , since we are interested on what happens for very cold clouds ( with temperature of order 20 k or even below ) . moreover , also from the observational point of view the transition between the ground state and the first excited state gives possibly the strongest contribution at very low temperatures as suggested by the measurements by jaffe & bremer ( 1997 ) on the emission in the @xmath0(1 - 0 ) s(1 ) line .",
    "we then estimate in sect .",
    "4 the equilibrium temperatures of the clouds for the centaurus , hydra and pks 0745 - 191 clusters , and discuss the observational consequences . + some technical details of the calculations are given in two appendices .",
    "the clouds are embedded in the hot intracluster gas , whose emission is dominated by thermal bremsstrahlung and thus the clouds are mainly heated by @xmath4-rays . the mechanisms by which soft @xmath4-rays heat a gas cloud have been extensively studied by a number of authors : habing & goldsmith ( 1971 ) and bergeron & souffrin ( 1971 ) for @xmath17 regions , glassgold & langer ( 1973 ) for molecular hydrogen clouds .",
    "+ due to the increased number of possible charged - particle reactions with molecules , the heating mechanism for molecules is different and more complicated as compared to the heating processes for atoms alone .",
    "glassgold & langer ( 1973 ) have given a survey of the physical processes for a pure molecular hydrogen medium .",
    "while @xmath4-ray heating of molecular hydrogen regions has been extensively studied , this has not been the case for other molecular species .",
    "glassgold & langer ( 1973 ) discuss in detail the energy loss processes and present a quantitative analysis which shows which part of the incident @xmath4-ray energy will go into heat . in appendix",
    "a we recall the heating processes for @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 molecules which are of interest for us .",
    "+ in order to evaluate the bremsstrahlung flux coming from the intracluster gas , we must define a density distribution for the electrons in the gas .",
    "a classical profile is a non - singular isothermal sphere ( jones & forman 1984 ) : @xmath18 where @xmath19 @xmath20 is the central gas number density , @xmath21 is the core radius and @xmath22 is the distance from the center of the cluster . in cooling flow clusters",

    "the photoionization process of @xmath0 creates an energetic electron and an @xmath48 ion ( wishart 1979 ) : @xmath49 different routes are then possible : one of the ways is that @xmath48 recombines with a thermal electron ( nakashima , takanagi & nakamura 1987 ) : @xmath50 producing a photon but no heating , since the photon can escape from the cloud .",
    "the second route is that @xmath48 collides with @xmath0 and gives rise to the reaction ( prasad & huntress 1980 ) @xmath51 followed by the reaction @xmath52 these two reactions are exothermal and lead , therefore , to a transfer of energy and a heating of 10.96 ev for every @xmath0 involved in the process ( glassgold & langer 1973 ) .",
    "the fact that the @xmath1 molecule has a permanent dipole moment ( @xmath53 debye , see abgrall , roueff & viala 1982 ) leads to @xmath4-ray heating processes , which are different from those for @xmath0 .",
    "thus , after the classical photoionization process ( von bush & dunn 1972 ) : @xmath54 one could expect a chemistry similar to reactions ( a3 ) and ( a4 ) with an intermediate species @xmath55 , that takes over the role of the @xmath56 ion",
    ". the knowledge of the @xmath55 chemistry is , however , very poor and we will not discuss it in more details .",

    "the situation is different .",
    "the energetic primary electrons lose their energy by electronic excitation and ionisation , the latter process leading to secondary electrons : @xmath65 whenever the kinetic energy of a primary or a secondary - generation electron falls below the threshold for inelastic scattering , it can lose energy only by elastic scattering on thermal electrons and thus most of his energy goes into heating .",
