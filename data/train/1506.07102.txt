    "in the last years the investigations on nanomechanical systems @xcite have rapidly been developed .",
    "the rush in this direction was estimulated by various perspectives and applications before unsuspected .",
    "the enormous progress in the research of nanomechanical systems has also placed the dream of controlling the interface between the quantum and classic worlds in a realistic way .",
    "this was shown by the emergence of hybrid quantum systems @xcite , which are intended to achieve a coherent transfer of quantum information from a single quantum emitter ( e.g. , superconducting qubits , cooper pair box , microwave resonators , quantum dots , etc ) and a solid state mechanical resonator , which moves in quantum physics giving birth to a new paradigm .",
    "in addition , these systems have received considerable attention due to their diverse potential applications , including metrology ( mass force or spin ultra - sensitive detectors ) , based on the remarkable sensing properties of nanomechanical resonators and their very low mass and lightness .",
    "an important focus of quantum optics is concerned with the atom - photon system .",
    "inspired on the various tests applied to this coupled system and on the several results obtained , including the limitations , the researchers have passed from the light domain to the microwave domain of the superconducting version , the quantum electrodynamics circuit .",
    "this system furnishes a new test for microwave _ photons _  that interact with superconducting qubits@xcite.in this scenario the atom is substituted by a cooper pair box ( * cpb * ) while the photon is substituted by a nanomechanical resonator ( * nr * ) .",
    "so , the _ atom - field _ interacting system goes to the * * cpb * - * nr * * interacting system with the concomitant passage from the optical domain to the microwave domain .",
    "there are few works in the literature that treat the interaction between a * cpb * and a * nr * when the later has either a time dependent frequency @xcite or a time dependent amplitude of oscillation @xcite . the well known jaynes - cummings model ( @xmath0 ) , which describes the interaction of a single two - level atom and a single mode of a quantized radiation field , is the simplest model for this system and provides exact solutions . analogous to the * * cpb * - * nr * *",
    "system , but since the year 1963 , many others studies have previously implemented the @xmath0 to describe the atom - field interaction 15a2,15a4,15a1,15a3,15a5 .",
    "some generalized models were also constructed and extensively studied @xcite .",
    "the examples include the study of the mentioned systems in presence of the stark effect@xcite , e.g. , to investigate quantum nondemolition measurements @xcite .",
    "usually the investigations assume the field initially in a ( pure ) coherent state . as the atom - field interacion is turned on , the field state changes with time the evolution .",
    "then , if its coherence is lost , the field state becomes nonclassical @xcite .",
    "some references to this subject are , e.g. , on nonclassical properties of a state @xcite ; generation of superposition states@xcite ; on the degree of nonclassicality of a state @xcite and : sculpturing coherent states to get fock states @xcite - plus references therein .",
    "the traditional @xmath0 was extended to the case of _ intensity - dependent coupling _ , proposed by b. buck and c.v .",
    "sukumar buck in order to study the influence of the field intensity , via its excitation number , upon the atom - field system , where a single atom interacts with a single mode of an optical field .",
    "this model was generalized by v. buzek @xcite to include a new coupling , with time dependent intensity .  in the present work",
    "we will employ the model by buck - sukumar ( @xmath1 ) to study the * * cpb * - * nr * * system , namely : we will suppose the coupling being dependent of the intensity of the nr oscillations and also that it changes with time , as assumed in @xcite .",
    "in addition , we consider a more realistic scenario with the presence of dissipation effects and verify in which way they affect the excited level of the * * cpb**@xmath2 the excitations of the * * nr**@xmath2 and the dynamical properties of the entire * * cpb * - * nr * * system .",
    "some points considered here are : how dissipation spoils the system operation and in which way the detuning could prevent it , allowing us the control of entanglement features , collapse - revival effects , and others .",
    "the results obtained indicate the possibility of some potential applications aa1,aa2,aa3,aa4,aa5,aa6 .",
    "a superconductor * cpb * charge qubit is adjusted  to the input voltage @xmath3 of the system , through a capacitor with an input capacitance @xmath4 . following the configuration shown in fig .",
    "[ cooper ] we observe three loops : a small loop in the left , another in the right , and a great loop in the center .",
    "the control of the external parameters of the system can be implemented via the input voltage @xmath3 and the three external fluxes @xmath5 @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the control of theses parameters allows us to make the coupling between the * cpb * and the * nr*. we consider @xmath8 and assume as identical the four josephson junctions of the circuit system , having the same josephson energy @xmath9 ; the external fluxes @xmath10  and @xmath6  are also assumed as identical in magnitude , although they have opposite signs @xmath11 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "so , taking into account the decay in the excited level of the * cpb * and dissipation in the * * nr**@xmath12  we can write the total hamiltonian of the system as follows ,    @xmath13    in the eq .",
    "( [ a1 ] ) the first term describes the * nr * , the second describes the * cpb * , the third represents the intensity dependent interaction introduced by the @xmath1 model , here including the time dependent parameter @xmath14 introduced by buzek , the fourth term @xmath15 stands for the time dependent loss affecting the * cpb * and the fifth term @xmath16 stands for the time dependent loss that affects the * nr*. in the eq .",

    "( [ a1 ] ) stands for a non hermitian hamiltonian ( @xmath22 ) .",

    "@xcite a @xmath22 is considered to include damping in a system described by @xmath0 and to study entangled states of atoms in distinct cavities ; etc .",
    "in addition to the previous references concerned with @xmath24 here it is pertinent remembering an alternative treatment by carl m. bender bender , who defended the efficacy of the non hermitian @xmath25-symmetric hamiltonians .",
    "accordingly , although the hermiticity of the hamiltonian is sufficient to guarantee the two essential properties of quantum mechanics ( namely , reality of eigenvalues and unitary of the time evolution ) , it is not necessary . actually , various complex hamiltonians are also able to guarantee these two properties and they include the real symmetric hamiltonian as a special case , required by the @xmath25-symmetric quantum mechanics .",

    "<S> interesting results were found for the temporal evolutions of the entropy of each subsystem and of the excitation - inversion in the cooper pair box . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison was also performed about which of these two subsystems is more sensitive to the presence of losses . </S>",
    "<S> the results suggest that appropriate choices of the involved time dependent parameters allow us to monitor these two features of the subsystems and may offer potential applications , e.g. , in the generation of nonclassical states , quantum communication , quantum lithography . </S>"
