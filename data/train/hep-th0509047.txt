    "tunneling processes are very interesting nonperturbative phenomena .",
    "one can find the example of such process already in quantum mechanics , where it causes the energy splitting .",
    "there are tunneling processes in the field theory as well , for instance , pair production in external electromagnetic fields @xcite , decay of the false vacuum @xcite .    in some spontaneously broken gauge theories",
    "there are magnetic monopole and dyon solutions .",
    "it is supposed that they can be produced in strong enough external electromagnetic fields . in the weak coupling regime",
    "their masses are huge , and sizes are of order @xmath0 .",
    "the probability of magnetic monopole pair production in constant magnetic field was calculated in the work of affleck and manton @xcite using the instanton method . in the work of bachas and porrati",
    "@xcite the rate of pair production of open bosonic and supersymmetric strings in a constant electric field was calculated exactly . in the work of gorsky , saraikin and selivanov @xcite stringy deformed probability of monopole and w - boson",
    "pair production was obtained quasiclassically .",
    "it is possible for particles like monopole , dyon or w - boson to decay nonperturbatively in external fields @xcite .",
    "monopole can also decay nonperturbatively in the external 2-form field @xcite .",
    "in this paper we consider the process of magnetic monopole decay into electron and dyon , and w - boson decay into dyon and monopole using instanton method .",
    "euclidean configuration corresponding to the monopole decay is represented on the fig.[classical traject ] .",
    "exponential factor in the probability is given by the minimum of the electron , dyon and monopole total effective action ( see ( [ eff action ] ) ) .",
    "this leads to ( [ classical action ] ) for the classical action . when monopole mass is equal to zero , one gets well - known result for exponential dependence of probability for pair production in external field",
    "dyon is not pointlike particle , so to apply this method for calculation one must imply that the size of dyon is much smaller then the size of electron - dyon loop .",
    "so , there is some condition imposed on the external field .",
    "the approximation used in this case is analogous to the thin wall approximation in the problem of the false vacuum decay .",
    "there is also condition of the dyon stability @xmath1 , where @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 are masses of electron , dyon and monopole respectively .",
    "contrary to spontaneous pair production , the process of the particle decay does nt occur for arbitrary masses .",
    "it is shown that for the case when the relation ( [ condition on masses ] ) is fulfilled there are two negative eigenmodes , so , there is no decay at all .",
    "coulomb corrections are taken into account similar to the work @xcite in the limit @xmath5 .",
    "one can obtain schwingers @xcite result for probability of @xmath6 pair production summing the diagrams for vacuum amplitude similar to one represented on fig.[diagram ] :    @xmath7    the probability connected with the amplitude is of the form @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the probability of pair production per unit time per unit volume . @xmath10 using the representation @xmath11 one obtains @xmath12 so , the probability for the process of @xmath6 pair production looks as follows @xmath13      the result obtained in the previous section is valid only for small coupling constant , since it does nt take into account self interaction of electron loop ( see fig.[photon interchange ] ) .",
    "authors of @xcite have derived the expression for probability of monopole - antimonopole pair creation in external magnetic field using instanton method .",
    "as we know the rate of decay follows from the imaginary part of the ground state energy @xmath14 where the energy @xmath15 is obtained from @xmath16}.\\ ] ] using the wkb approximation one can do the integral and find the necessary probability per unit time per unit volume @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the classical action calculated on the instanton solution , and @xmath19 is one loop factor arising from the second variation of action .",
    "we should note that operator of the second variation must have one and only one negative eigenvalue .",
    "affleck and manton have calculated @xmath19 and @xmath18 with the following result @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 are the mass and the charge of the monopole and @xmath23 is the strength of the external magnetic field .",
    "+ the exponential factor in the probability can be immediately obtained by minimizing the effective action @xmath24 where l is the length of classical monopole trajectory in the magnetic field , q is the area restricted by this trajectory . note that recently instanton approach has been used for calculation of the probability of the pair production in the nonhomogeneous fields @xcite and in gravitational background @xcite .",
    "now let us turn to the calculation of probability of the monopole decay in the external electric field .",
    "it was argued @xcite that particles like monopole ( w - boson ) can decay in the external electric ( magnetic ) field into electron and dyon ( dyon and antimonopole ) , the junction such as ( dem ) naturally appears in the string theory . to find the probability we have to calculate the correction to green s function in the presence of electron and dyon .",
    "green s function of free heavy monopole in external electro - magnetic field in euclidean time can be written as : @xmath25    taking into account one bounce correction we have @xmath26{rl } g(t,0;0,0)_{bounce}\\sim&\\int\\mathcal{d}x\\mathcal{d}z\\exp\\bigl(-m\\int \\sqrt{\\dot{x}^{2}}dt - m_{d}\\int \\sqrt{\\dot{z}^{2}}dt - m_{m}(t - h)\\bigr . \\\\ \\\\",

    "this correction is the first term of expansion of full green s function @xmath27 , and as we know , twice the imaginary part of the mass yields the probability of the decay .",

    "let us make a short digression on the w - boson decay in the magnetic field .",
    "it was argued that w - boson can decay nonperturbatively in external magnetic field into monopole and dyon as magnetic monopole in external electric field @xcite into electron and dyon .",
    "however , since strong enough magnetic fields occur in cosmology more often then strong electric fields the formula for w - boson decay could be even more useful .",
