    "correlations among physical quantities of clusters of galaxies are very useful tools for studying formation of clusters and cosmological parameters .",
    "in particular , the luminosity ( @xmath4)-temperature ( @xmath5 ) relation in x - ray clusters has been studied by many authors .",
    "observations show that clusters of galaxies exhibit a correlation of approximately @xmath3 ( edge & stewart 1991 ; david et al . 1993 ; allen & fabian 1998 ; markevitch 1998 ; arnaud & evrard 1998 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "a simple theoretical model predicts @xmath6 on the assumptions that ( 1 ) the internal structures of clusters of different mass are similar ; in particular , the ratio of gas mass to virial mass in the clusters ( @xmath7 ) is constant ; ( 2 ) all clusters identified at some redshift have the same characteristic density , which scales with the mean density of the universe ( e.g. kaiser 1986 ; navarro , frenk , & white 1995 ; eke , navarro , & frenk 1998 ) .",
    "this discrepancy remains one of the most important problems in clusters of galaxies .",
    "the discrepancy of the @xmath8 relation is not easily resolved even if we relax one of these basic assumptions .",
    "we just show an example , where the assumption ( 1 ) is relaxed .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of clusters is approximately given by @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the characteristic gas density , and @xmath11 is the core radius .",
    "thus , the observed relation @xmath3 indicates that @xmath12 .",
    "if the gravitational matter has the same core radius as gas , the baryon mass fraction is given by @xmath13 .",
    "if we assume @xmath14 , we obtain @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and the characteristic density of gravitational matter @xmath19 . assuming that @xmath20 is constant in the spirit of the above assumption ( 2 ) ( so - called recent - formation approximation )",
    ", we should take @xmath21 .",
    "thus , this model predicts a correlation of @xmath22 .",
    "however , such a correlation has not been found , although many authors have investigated relations among the physical quantities of clusters ( e.g. edge & stewart 1991 ; mohr & evrard 1997 ; arnaud & evrard 1998 , mohr , mathiesen , & evrard 1999 ) .",
    "it is to be noted that in the spirit of the above assumption ( 1 ) , it is favorable to use core radii when comparing clusters with different masses , although some previous studies use isophotal radii instead of core radii in the analysis ( e.g. mohr & evrard 1997 ) .",
    "some other studies use a virial radius , defined as the radius of a sphere of which the mean interior density is proportional to the critical density of the universe at the observed redshift of the cluster ( @xmath23 ) . however , these radii are derived from the temperatures of clusters , and are not independent of the temperatures ( e.g. mohr et al . 1999 ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath4 is mainly determined by structure around core region which preserves the information of the background universe when the cluster collapsed ( e.g. navarro , frenk , & white 1997 ; salvador - sol , solanes , & manrique 1998 ) .",
    "thus , we adopt the core radius as the characteristic scale of a cluster .",
    "since most previous works implicitly assumed that clusters form a one - parameter family , the failure of finding the correlations including core radii suggests that clusters form a two - parameter family instead .    in this letter",
    ", we reanalyze the observational data of x - ray clusters and study the relations in detail based on the idea of fundamental plane . originally , the word , fundamental plane , represents a relation among effective radius , surface brightness , and velocity dispersion of elliptical and s0 galaxies ( e.g. faber et al .",
    "1987 ; djorgovski & davis 1987 ) . in this study , we apply the notion of the fundamental plane to x - ray clusters and discuss relations among @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath5 . in  [ sec : data ] , results are presented and in  [ sec : dis ] , their implications are discussed . throughout the paper",
    "we assume @xmath24 .",
    "we use the observational data of the central density , @xmath10 , core radius , @xmath11 , and temperature , @xmath5 , of 45 clusters in the catalogue of mohr et al .",
    "we have confirmed that the results in this section are almost identical to those based on the catalogue of jones & forman ( 1984 ) .",
    "mohr et al . ( 1999 ) gathered the temperature data of previous _ asca _ , _ ginga _ and _ einstein _ observations . on the other hand",
    ", they obtained central densities and core radii using _ rosat _ data ; they fitted surface brightness profiles by the conventional @xmath25 model , @xmath26^{3\\beta/2 } } \\:,\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the distance from the cluster center , and @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath25 are fitting parameters . if an excess in emission ( so - called cooling flow ) is seen in the innermost region , mohr et al .",
    "( 1999 ) fitted this component by an additional @xmath25 model , @xmath30^{3\\beta/2 } } \\:.\\ ] ] since we are interested in global structure of clusters , we use @xmath28 and @xmath29 as @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively . since mohr et al .",
    "( 1999 ) presented only @xmath31 for the clusters with central excess , we calculate @xmath28 by @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the central surface brightness corresponding to the components ( [ eq : beta ] ) and ( [ eq : beta2 ] ) , respectively .",
    "although @xmath11 and @xmath25 are correlated , each of them was determined exactly enough for our analysis ( see fig.4 in mohr et al .",
    "[ 1999 ] )    the data plotted in the @xmath35 space are fitted with a plane , @xmath36 the result of the least square fitting with equal weight for simplicity is @xmath37 .",
    "the scatter about the plane is 0.06 dex .",
    "this amounts to a scatter of about 15% , which is a typical observational error .",
    "we call the plane the fundamental plane , hereafter .",
    "the ratio @xmath38 is close to @xmath39 , which is expected when @xmath40 .",
    "thus , the observed relation , @xmath3 , basically corresponds to a cross section of the fundamental plane .    in order to study more closely , we investigate further the distribution of the observational data on the fundamental plane .",
    "we fit the data to another plane , @xmath41 under the constraint , @xmath42 this means that the plane ( [ eq : nplane ] ) is perpendicular to the fundamental plane ( [ eq : plane ] ) .",
    "the result is @xmath43 .",
    "the scatter about the plane is 0.2 dex .",
    "we call this plane the vertical plane. for convenience , two unit vectors in the @xmath44 space are defined by , @xmath45 @xmath46 moreover , one of the unit vectors perpendicular to both @xmath47 and @xmath48 is defined as @xmath49",
    ". the set of three vectors is one of the bases in the @xmath44 space .",
    "thus , the equations @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 are three orthogonal quantities .",
    "figure 1 shows the cross section of the fundamental plane viewed from the @xmath53 axis .",
    "figure 2 shows the data on the @xmath54 plane , i.e. , the fundamental plane .",
    "as can be seen , a clear correlation exists on the plane , that is , clusters form a band in the @xmath35 space .",
    "the major axis of the band is the cross line of the fundamental and vertical planes , and a vector along the major axis is proportional to @xmath55 .",
    "we refer to the band as fundamental band , hereafter .",
    "note that the line determined by the least square method directly from the three - dimensional data is almost parallel to the vector @xmath56 .",
    "the vector @xmath55 means that @xmath57 @xmath58 relation ( [ eq : tr ] ) indicates that the major axis of the fundamental band is nearly parallel to the @xmath59 plane , i.e. , temperature varies very little along the fundamental band .",
    "thus , the observed relation @xmath60 should be the correlation along the minor axis of the band on the fundamental plane as is explicitly shown in the next section .",
    "the results presented in the previous section demonstrate that the clusters of galaxies are seen to populate a planar distribution in the global parameter space @xmath35 . therefore , clusters turn out to be a two - parameter family .",
    "the observed relation @xmath3 is a cross section of this fundamental plane. moreover , there is a correlation among the data on the fundamental plane although the dispersion is relatively large .",
    "this fundamental band is a newly found correlation between density and radius with a fixed temperature .    in order to further investigate the relation between physical quantities and the data distribution in the @xmath61 space ,",
    "we represent @xmath4 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath20 by @xmath65 , @xmath53 , and @xmath66 , using the obtained relations @xmath67 @xmath68 @xmath69 the results are @xmath70 @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath73 @xmath74 exactly speaking , @xmath62 and @xmath75 represent the core masses rather than the masses of the whole cluster . in relation ( [ eq : vir ] ) , we assume that clusters of galaxies are in dynamical equilibrium .",
    "the scatters of @xmath65 , @xmath53 , and @xmath66 are @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 , respectively .",
    "thus , @xmath66 is the major axis of the fundamental band and is the primary parameter of the data distribution . on the other hand , relation ( [ eq : t ] )",
    "indicates that the scatter of @xmath53 nearly corresponds to a variation of @xmath5 because @xmath79 .",
    "it can be also shown that a variation of @xmath4 is dominated by the scatter of @xmath53 .",
    "since @xmath53 corresponds the minor axis of the fundamental band , this means that the @xmath8 relation is well represented by only the secondary parameter @xmath53 , but not by the primary parameter @xmath66 . to put it differently",
    ", @xmath80 depends on only @xmath5 , which is consistent with previous findings .",
    "the result reflects the fact that a combination of @xmath10 and @xmath11 like @xmath81 behaves as a function of @xmath5 ( relation [ [ eq : nr ] ] ) , while @xmath10 or @xmath11 varies almost independently of @xmath5 ( relations [ [ eq : tr ] ] ) .",
    "if we safely ignore the scatter of @xmath65 and @xmath66 in relations ( [ eq : t ] ) and ( [ eq : lx ] ) , we obtain @xmath82 , and @xmath83 .",
    "this slope of the @xmath8 relation approaches the observed ones , although it is slightly larger . on the other hand , @xmath62 , @xmath75 , and @xmath64",
    "are not represented by any one of the parameters @xmath65 , @xmath53 , and @xmath66 ; both @xmath53 and @xmath66 contribute to their variations .",
    "note that @xmath20 is mainly governed by @xmath66 as relation ( [ eq : rho_vir ] ) shows .",
    "the above analysis raises two questions .",
    "the first question is why the combination like @xmath81 behaves as a function of only @xmath5 , or equivalently why @xmath65 is nearly constant . in the following arguments",
    ", we assume that the scatter of @xmath65 is due to observational errors , that is , @xmath84 is essentially zero .",
    "the behavior of @xmath64 may be a clue to the question .",
    "since we allow two parameters , @xmath64 can be expressed in terms of any two physical parameters .",
    "for example , if we express @xmath64 with @xmath75 and @xmath20 , @xmath64 turns out to be determined by @xmath85 .",
    "this means that the baryon fraction in clusters is an increasing function of @xmath86 .",
    "if we adopt the relation of @xmath87 by hand and ignore @xmath88 hereafter , we obtain @xmath89 ( relations [ [ eq : lx]]-[[eq : frac ] ] ) , which is roughly consistent with the shape of the fundamental plane , and the @xmath8 relation .",
    "such a relation of @xmath64 may be realized if supernovae in the galaxies in the clusters heat the intracluster medium . in other words , the behavior of @xmath64 is likely to originate from the thermal history of clusters of galaxies .",
    "the second question is why clusters form a two - parameter family .",
    "we think that one natural parameter is @xmath75 . as another physically meaningful parameter",
    ", we may choose @xmath20 .",
    "relation ( [ eq : rho_vir ] ) implies that @xmath20 is not constant , which is inconsistent with the simple theoretical prediction , and that it varies nearly independent of temperature .",
    "since @xmath20 is supposed to reflect the critical density of the universe when the cluster , especially around the core region , collapsed , this suggests that the present day clusters consist of objects with a range of collapse redshift . in a separate paper",
    ", we investigate cosmological implication of the results presented in this paper ( fujita & takahara 1999 ) .",
    "finally , we show that the results of this paper reproduce the size - temperature relation found by mohr & evrard ( 1997 ) and gas mass - temperature relation found by mohr et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . since surface brightness profiles of clusters in the envelope region are given by @xmath90 when @xmath91 , isophotal size , @xmath92 , has the relation @xmath93 .",
    "eliminating @xmath10 by the relation of the fundamental plane , @xmath94 , we obtain the relation @xmath95 .",
    "this is consistent with the size - temperature relation @xmath96 , although a coefficient @xmath97 induces scatter of @xmath98% for a given @xmath5 .",
    "the correlation corresponds to a cross section of the fundamental plane seen slightly inclined from the direction of @xmath66 axis .",
    "next , the consistency with the gas mass - temperature relation is explained as follows : as in mohr et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , let us define @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 , where @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 are the virial radius , the virial mass , and the gas mass of a cluster , respectively ; index m refers to the quantities for @xmath105 .",
    "when @xmath106 , we can show that @xmath107 , because @xmath108 .",
    "since we find @xmath109 , and since @xmath110 is nearly constant by definition , we obtain the relation @xmath111 .",
    "this is consistent with the relation @xmath112 found by mohr et al .",
    "note that the scatter originated from @xmath97 is not conspicuous when the observational data are plotted , because of the steepness of the relation ( @xmath113 ) .",
    "this correlation also corresponds to a cross section of the fundamental plane seen from very near to the direction of @xmath66 axis ."
