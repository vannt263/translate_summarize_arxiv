    "the sound velocity starts to decrease . in hto ,",
    "the sound velocity decreases rapidly from the lowest temperatures showing a drastic change of the slope near @xmath25 around 2  k. the details of the sound - velocity and attenuation change close to and below @xmath26 depend sensitively on the temperature - sweep rate and sample history .",
    "remarkably , both materials show rather small velocity change just above @xmath25 , between @xmath26 and 3@xmath26 , whereas below @xmath26 there is a stiffening of the @xmath16 mode in hto and a softening of the same mode in dto .",

    "the hysteresis in the vicinity of the distinguished point is less pronounced ( not shown ) . both , the rapid change in the sound velocity and the decrease in the sound attenuation below the distinguished temperature show that the magneto - elastic interactions are relevant for physics of these spin - ice materials .",

    "@xcite however , definite conclusion can not be drawn from the ultrasound data . anyhow , from our results it seems reasonable to assume that there is no structural transformation in hto at the lowest temperatures , since no abrupt , temperature - localized features expected for the acoustic modes in case of structural transformation have been detected .    ,",

    "taking into account the field - sweep rate we can assume that the relaxation to equilibrium in hto is shorter than 1 s being much faster than estimated 1 min in dto.@xcite this could also be the reason for the significant differences seen for the @xmath27 mode at the gas - liquid - type transition in dto and hto .",

    "the renormalization of phonon velocities and sound attenuation in magnetic media for stationary situation is caused mostly by two reasons .",
    "@xcite first , sound waves change ligand positions , and , therefore , the crystalline electric field of ligands is affected .",
    "due to strong spin - orbit interaction , the latter produces changes of the single - ion magnetic anisotropy of rare - earth ions .",
    "this should also change the effective @xmath35-factors of rare - earth ions .",
    "thus , due to magneto - elastic interactions , sound waves can change the directions of the magnetic anisotropy slightly , and vice versa , the magnetic anisotropy modifies the sound - wave parameters , such as the sound velocity and attenuation .",
    "this interaction between the sound wave and the magnetic properties exists at all temperatures lower than the characteristic energy of the single - ion magnetic anisotropy .    on the other hand ,",
    "sound waves change the magnetic ion positions themselves and/or the positions of nonmagnetic ions involved in the superexchange between magnetic ones . in this case ,",
    "sound waves renormalize the effective exchange ( as well as dipolar ) interactions between magnetic ions .",
    "the manifestation of this effect is more pronounced compared to the influence of the sound on the single - ion magnetic properties , because inter - ionic magnetic and exchange interactions predominantly determine magnetic phase transitions . here",
    "the relative renormalization of the sound velocity @xmath19 and the sound attenuation @xmath20 are related to the changes of the exchange integrals due to effect of sound waves on distances between the moments involved into the exchanges .",
    "these renormalizations are proportional to spin correlation functions ; the latter can be approximated as combinations of the components of the magnetization and magnetic susceptibility of the magnetic subsystem . in dto and hto ,",
    "the single - ion anisotropy is of the order of 300  k. this is why we expect that the sound - mode changes at low temperatures are mostly related to the renormalization of inter - ionic magnetic interactions due to the spin - phonon coupling . to describe the features of the sound in dto and hto we adapt the approach used in refs .  .",

    ", we can take into account that under such condition @xmath73 and @xmath74 , i.e. , both the renormalization of the sound velocity and attenuation have to be inversely proportional to the temperature .    , at different temperatures for the field applied along the @xmath70 $ ] direction . ]    , at different temperatures for the field applied along the @xmath70 $ ] direction . ]    a qualitative explanation of the `` negative relaxation '' ( i.e. @xmath75 in the expression for the relaxation rate ) can be the following . for spin - ice systems in the absence of an external field , the ground state is highly degenerate . under the influence of the sound",
    "the degeneracy can be locally lifted .",
    "it is possible , then , that the relaxation is not to the configuration with the lowest energy , which has to be positive , but to some dynamical steady - state configuration of spins with energy higher than the lowest energy of spins in the absence of sound ( cf .",
    "ref .  , where the relaxation of parametrically excited magnons in the spin system was to the dynamical steady - state configuration of spins , which had higher energy in the absence of parametric pumping ) , which can yield effective `` negative relaxation '' .",
    "the `` field - cooled '' case , instead , implies for the field directed along @xmath70 $ ] , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , i.e. an almost temperature - independent renormalization of the sound velocity and zero sound attenuation at low temperatures for @xmath78 .",
    "figures  [ v111h ] and [ pogl111h ] show the calculated magnetic - field dependences of the sound velocity and attenuation at several temperatures .",
    "the sound velocity shows a step - like feature at a critical magnetic field , while the attenuation shows a deep minimum , in agreement with our experiment ( fig .",
    "[ prb ] ) .    at this value of the external magnetic field , directed along @xmath70 $ ] , the magnetization jumps from @xmath79 to @xmath80 of the saturation value . as the temperature increases",
    ", it broadens these features , slightly shifting their positions to higher fields .",
    "the features near @xmath81 are related to the step - like field - induced magnetization , observed in dto and hto .",
    "this , in fact , is the the manifestation of the transition between the spin - ice and kagome - ice phases for the external magnetic field directed along @xmath70 $ ] ( see , e.g. ref .  ) . in the absence of field , all states are degenerate ( with the lowest - energy configuration `` two in - two out '' ) , which yields the large residual pauling entropy @xmath82 per spin .",
    "on the other hand , the small nonzero magnetic field fixes the `` out '' direction of one spin , while the three other spins in the tetrahedron are free to choose , which of them is directed `` out '' to fulfill the spin - ice rule . in this case , the entropy of the system becomes smaller than the pauling value , @xmath83 in fact , the exact value is @xmath840.08077.@xcite    to summarize , our simplified theory explains well the magnetic field behavior of the sound velocity and attenuation .",
    "the temperature behavior in the external magnetic field ( the field - cooled case ) , given by the theory , also qualitatively agrees with the experimental results .",
    "however , the zero field - cooled case , i.e. the temperature behavior of the sound characteristics in the absence of the external field does not agree well with the data of our experiments .",
    "such a disagreement is , probably , related to the fact that bethe - peierls approximation for spin ices works less satisfactory for absent fields , where the highest level of degeneracy in spin ices is expected .",
    "the purpose of this section is to provide an explanation for the pronounced changes in the sound velocity at high fields applied along the @xmath70 $ ] ( fig .",
    "[ pulsehto ] ) and [ 112 ] ( fig .  [ dto112puls ] ) directions .",
    "we do not analyze here the data shown in fig .",
    "[ prb000 ] because of a big anharmonic background in the temperature dependence of the sound velocity , which can not be accurately subtracted from the data .",
    "the fields attained by the experiments are on the scale of @xmath85 of order of 100  k which is much larger than the scale of the interactions ( which are of the order of @xmath86 k ) but comparable to the cef splittings .",
    "therefore , in contrast to the previous section , we ignore the exchange couplings and consider instead the coupling between the lattice degrees of freedom and the single - ion anisotropy mediated by deformations of the crystal - field environment surrounding the magnetic ions . the model we study is @xmath87 the first term , @xmath88 , is the energy cost of deforming the crystal .",
    "the second part @xmath89 , is the single - ion crystal - field hamiltonian on each site with zeeman term @xmath90 .",
    "the magneto - elastic interaction is @xmath91 .    since the materials are cubic there are three independent elastic moduli by symmetry",
    "so , @xmath92 where the strains @xmath93 are dimensionless and the elastic moduli @xmath94 expressed in gpa .",
    "the crystal field and zeeman terms are @xmath95 here , @xmath96 are stevens operators on site @xmath97 .",
    "the crystal - field hamiltonian is written in local coordinate frames - one for each of the four sublattices in the tetrahedral basis - in which the local @xmath98 axes are aligned along the respective [ 111 ] directions , see above .",
    "the stevens operators are restricted to @xmath99 = 2,4 and 6 because the magnetic ions have orbital angular momentum @xmath100 .",
    "the further restriction to the six operators given above comes about because the crystal - field environment is symmetric under the operations of point goup @xmath101 . in the following , we take parameters @xmath102 for hto ( @xmath103 ) obtained by fitting the spectrum of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : hcf ] ) to inelastic neutron data.@xcite for dto ( @xmath104 ) , we convert the aforementioned parameters assuming a point - charge approximation for the crystal field @xmath105 where @xmath106 are @xmath107 radial expectation values and the @xmath108 are stevens factors which have been tabulated . in @xmath90 , @xmath109 is the land factor appropriate to the magnetic ion under consideration ( @xmath110 , @xmath111 ) .",
    "the magneto - elastic coupling results from the crystal - field hamiltonian by expanding in small displacements about the equilibrium ionic positions .",
    "it is convenient to separate these displacements into macroscopic strain , macroscopic rotations , and microscopic strains coming from displacements of the sublattices . in the following we ( i )",
    "consider the material to be completely homogeneous and ( ii ) include only the effect of macroscopic strains from which the sound velocities are to be computed .",
    "even with these simplifications , the magneto - elastic couplings are @xmath112_{\\alpha\\beta}\\bar{\\epsilon}_{\\alpha\\beta } o^{l}_{m } \\nonumber \\\\ & & = \\sum_{i,\\gamma } \\sum_{l , m } \\left [ g^{l}_{m }   \\right]_{\\nu}(\\gamma )",
    "\\bar{\\epsilon}_{\\nu}(\\gamma ) o^{l}_{m } \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath113 denotes an irreducible representation ( irrepn ) of the group of local crystal field symmetry , @xmath101 , and @xmath114 runs over the basis states of the irrepn .",
    "the allowed strains can be grouped according to how they transform with respect to the point group @xmath101 of the local crystal field environment : @xmath115 ( 1d ) , @xmath116 ( 1d ) , @xmath117 ( 2d ) , and @xmath118 ( 2d ) .",
    "we now compute the change in the longitudinal sound velocity in a magnetic field applied along the @xmath119 $ ] direction for dto .",
    "we set the temperature to @xmath120  k. whereas in zero field all four sublattices of the pyrochlore lattice are equivalent , the @xmath119 $ ] magnetic field results in three inequivalent directions with the moments on one of the sublattices ( in our convention , sublattice @xmath121 ) perpendicular to the field .",
    "we have also examined spectra for sets of parameters computed from first principles using the point - charge approximation .",
    "the generic features of the low - lying crystal field levels are as follows .",
    "the degeneracy of the lowest ising doublet is split at the smallest fields but only weakly on sublattice @xmath121 as a result of admixing with excited levels .",
    "there are level crossings of the first - excited levels above the low - lying doublet at the fields probed by experiment and a ground state level crossing on sublattice @xmath121 between @xmath122 t and @xmath123  t which is associated with a gradual upturn in the magnetization .",
    "we have studied the sound velocity as a function of field for many choices of magnetoelastic couplings .",
    "typically , we observe two principal features in @xmath19 .",
    "the first is a peak or trough which is associated with the thermal depopulation of the first excited level .",
    "we make this correspondence based on the fact that the temperature is set to a value between @xmath124 and @xmath120  k and , at these low temperatures , the feature is found to shift to lower fields at lower temperatures . in contrast , the experimental data reveals an anomaly with a minimum at about @xmath125 t at both @xmath124 and @xmath120  k ( fig . [ dto112puls ] ) .",
    "the second main feature in our calculation of @xmath19 is a large anomaly at the ground - state level crossing that occurs at about @xmath122  t in the spectrum computed from the parameters obtained ( i ) from the point - charge approximation , ( ii ) by converting parameters from those obtained in ref .  , and ( iii )",
    "the parameters reported in ref .",
    "however , these sets of crystal field parameters are not taken directly from experimental measurements .",
    "one might consider the sound - velocity data reported here to indicate a ground state level crossing on sublattice  1 at around @xmath126  t. if this is the case then the available crystal field parameters either overestimate the crystal field gap or underestimate the moment of the first excited levels .    for a field aligned along the [ 111 ] direction in hto the longitudinal sound velocity decreases showing a minimum at about 47  t ( fig .",
    "[ pulsehto ] ) .",
    "this field direction has the characteristic of creating two inequivalent magnetic sites - one with the field aligned along the direction of the zero - field anisotropy ( sublattice 0 in our convention ) and the second ( belonging to tetrahedral sublattices 1 , 2 , and 3 ) at an angle of about 54.7  degrees to it .",
    "looking at the crystal - field spectra for these sublattices ( and for various sets of crystal - field parameters ) one observes that the degeneracy of the ground - state ising doublet is lifted in arbitrarily weak fields as one expects - the moments are pinned , as far as possible given the anisotropy , along the field direction . for sublattice 0 ,",
    "there is a succession of excited - state level crossings , with the ground state being pinned along the field direction . for the other sublattices , there is a ground - state level crossing ( at about 62  t for the parameters of ref .  ) and a crossing of the first - excited level at about half of this field .",
    "the ground - state level crossing is associated with a step in the magnetization which is not present in the experimental data up to 60  t although there is an upturn in the magnetization at the highest fields which is also present in the calculated magnetization up to 60  t. we expect that an exploration of the magnetization at higher field would reveal the predicted step in the magnetization within a few tesla of 60  t.    we have calculated @xmath127 for the parameters obtained from the point - charge approximation . for a large number of choices of magnetoelastic couplings , the picture presented by these calculations is that a single feature dominates @xmath127 with a minimum at fields below the ground state level crossing by up to 10  t ( fig .",
    "[ fig : deltav ] ) .",
    "it is , therefore , likely that the ground - state level crossing on magnetic sites belonging to sublattices 1 , 2 , and 3 is responsible for the form of the high - field sound - velocity data .     in hto from field parameters of ref .   and @xmath34 $ ] .",
    "the dip in the sound velocity is a typical feature - only weakly dependent on the choice of magnetoelastic couplings . ]",
    "the spin - ice materials hto and dto show a number of unusual features in their ultrasound properties .",
    "although the overall temperature dependence for both materials is similar at high temperatures , pronounced differences appear at low temperatures and low magnetic fields ( close to and in the spin - ice state ) .",
    "anomalies in the sound velocity and sound attenuation in dto and hto are observed at around 0.6 and 2  k , respectively , proving the relevance of the magneto - elastic interactions for physics of these spin - ice materials .",
    "additional evidence for the spin - strain couplings comes from peculiarities in the field - dependent acoustic properties in the spin - ice state .",
    "the field - induced non - equilibrium phenomena in the spin - ice state of dto appear for different demagnetization factors and sound - propagation directions , but vanish when there is a strong thermal coupling to the bath .",
    "this observation demonstrates the crucial role of the thermal runaway as a balance between the intrinsic and extrinsic non - equilibrium field - driven processes in spin - ice . in hto ,",
    "no thermal runaway was found .    at the gas - liquid - type phase transition in dto a sharp dip in",
    "the sound attenuation appears .",
    "this striking anomaly indicates that in presence of sound waves there may be a dynamical steady state having higher energy resulting in negative relaxation processes .",
    "the experimental results agree qualitatively with our theoretical modeling of these processes , based on exchange - striction couplings . remarkably , no such relaxation processes have been observed in hto .",
    "pulsed - field ultrasound data exhibit anomalies around 50  t due to cef effects in both spin - ice materials .",
    "our high - magnetic - field results are described reasonably well by a cef model .",
    "calculations based on the cef scheme have revealed that these anomalies are related to various level crossings in these spin - ice systems .",

    "<S> we report ultrasound studies of spin - lattice and single - ion effects in the spin - ice materials dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 ( dto ) and ho@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 ( hto ) across a broad field range up to 60 t , covering phase transformations , interactions with low - energy magnetic excitations , as well as single - ion effects . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , a sharp dip observed in the sound attenuation in dto at the gas - liquid transition of the magnetic monopoles is explained based on an approach involving negative relaxation processes . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , quasi - periodic peaks in the acoustic properties of dto due to non - equilibrium processes are found to be strongly affected by _ </S>",
    "<S> macroscopic _ thermal - coupling conditions : the thermal runaway observed in previous studies in dto can be suppressed altogether by immersing the sample in liquid helium . </S>",
    "<S> crystal - electric - field effects having higher energy scale lead to a renormalization of the sound velocity and sound attenuation at very high magnetic fields . </S>",
