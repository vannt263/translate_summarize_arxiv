    "as first formulated by riemann more than a hundred years ago , the solution of the one - dimensional riemann problem in hydrodynamics consists of determining the temporal evolution of a fluid which , at some initial time , has two adjacent uniform states characterized by different values of uniform velocity , pressure and density .",
    "these initial conditions completely determine the way in which the discontinuity will decay after removal of the barrier separating the initial `` left '' and `` right '' states .",
    "the riemann problem has ceased to be merely academic and has gained enormous importance when it was realized that its numerical solution can serve as the building block of hydrodynamical codes based on godunov - type finite difference methods ( @xcite ) . in such methods , the computational domain is discretized and each interface between two adjacent grid - zones is used to construct the initial left and right states of a `` local '' riemann problem . the evolution of the hydrodynamical equations is then obtained through the solution across the computational grid of the sequence of local riemann problems set up at the interfaces between successive grid - zones ( see @xcite , but also @xcite and @xcite for the use of the riemann problem in relativistic regimes ) .    in general , the riemann problem requires the solution of a nonlinear algebraic system of equations written as a function of a single unknown quantity ( _ e.g. _ the total pressure at the contact discontinuity in purely hydrodynamical problems ) . with the exception of few trivial initial configurations ,",
    "the solution of the riemann problem can not be obtained analytically but requires a numerical approach . the solution found in this way is referred to as the _",
    "`` exact '' _ solution of the riemann problem , to distinguish it from the _ `` approximate '' _ solution of the riemann problem , which is instead obtained when the system of equations is reduced to a locally - linear form ( an exhaustive discussion of approximate riemann solvers can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "it is therefore useful to stress that although named `` exact '' , the solution of the riemann problem is necessarily obtained with a small but nonzero truncation error .",
    "the exact solution of the riemann problem in relativistic hydrodynamics has been obtained only rather recently and was proposed by  @xcite for flows that are purely along the direction normal to the initial discontinuity .",
    "this work has then been extended to the case in which tangential velocities are present ( @xcite ) and improved in efficiency by exploiting the relativistic invariant relative velocity between the two states to predict the wave pattern produced ( @xcite and  @xcite ) .",
    "the relevance of these calculations has not been restricted to fundamental issues of relativistic hydrodynamics .",
    "quite the opposite , these solutions have been of great importance for the testing of complex multidimensional codes implementing high resolution shock capturing ( hrsc ) methods , and that are based on the approximate or exact solution of riemann problems at the interfaces between the numerical cells ( @xcite ) .",
    "these codes have then been used in various simulations in either fixed ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) or dynamical spacetimes ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this intense and recent development of numerical codes for the solution of the relativistic hydrodynamic equations has been accompanied by an equally intense development of codes solving the equations of magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) in relativistic regimes .",
    "the reason behind this activity is the widespread expectation that strong magnetic fields are crucial in the study and explanation of several puzzling astrophysical phenomena such as relativistic jets or @xmath0-ray bursts . as a result , and in the hope of clarifying issues in relativistic astrophysics which can not be described satisfactorily through analytic techniques , several groups have recently constructed numerical codes solving the equations of relativistic mhd on either fixed spacetimes ( see , for example , @xcite and @xcite for a flat background and @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for a black - hole background ) or in fully dynamical spacetimes ( @xcite ) .    just like their hydrodynamical counterparts , some of these codes",
    "are based on the solution of a local riemann problem suitably formulated for a magnetized fluid , and all are meant to be used for ultrarelativistic flows . however ,",
    "unlike their hydrodynamical counterparts , these codes can not benefit from the comparison with the exact solution of the riemann problem in relativistic mhd .",
    "the literature on the riemann problem in mhd is , in fact , much more limited and a general exact solution was found rather recently and for a newtonian fluid only ( @xcite ) .",
    "the background knowledge in this area is even more scarce for a relativistic fluid and while no general exact solution has been proposed yet , recent work has been made to derive an exact solution in the particular case in which the magnetic field of the initial states is tangential to the discontinuity and orthogonal to the fluid velocity ( @xcite ) . besides having a larger set of equations when compared to the corresponding problem in relativistic hydrodynamics , a considerable addition to the complexity of the riemann problem in relativistic mhd",
    "is represented by the fact that the mathematical structure of the problem itself is modified and the system of equations is no longer strictly hyperbolic  ( @xcite ) quasi - linear partial differential equations is said to be _ hyperbolic _ if the matrix of coefficients has @xmath1 real eigenvalues ; furthermore , the system is said to be _ totally _ or _ strictly hyperbolic _ if the eigenvalues are real and also all distinct . ] .",
    "the possibility of having coincident eigenvalues poses the question of the uniqueness of the solutions and this represents then a problem within the problem . as we will comment also later on , a lively debate on these issues",
    "is presently ongoing and progress is starting to be made , although first results are known in newtonian mhd only ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "because the focus of this work is the exact solution of the riemann problem in relativistic mhd as an aid to the development of numerical codes , hereafter we will adopt the _ working assumption _ that the riemann problems considered here have a solution and that this solution is unique .",
    "clearly , this hypothesis avoids the issue rather than solving it , but it allows for a marked progress at least in those cases in which compound waves are not found in numerically approximate solutions .",
    "a direct and important consequence of the scarcity of works in this area of fundamental relativistic mhd is that the validation of modern complex mhd codes for the most elementary and yet demanding tests has not been made in a quantitative manner for generic initial conditions .",
    "rather , it has taken place through the qualitative comparison with the large set of test - problems in relativistic mhd meticulously collected over the years ( see , for instance ,  @xcite and  @xcite ) .",
    "it should be recognized , however , that for non - generic initial states it is sufficient to have exact solutions for mhd shocks and rarefactions as this covers all types of basic hyperbolic waves of the system and indeed exact solutions of this type were used by komissarov ( 1999 ) for quantitative testing .",
    "on the other hand , the purpose of this paper is to present the procedure for the exact solution of the riemann problem in relativistic mhd with generic initial conditions .",
    "our approach considers both initial states with a zero component of the magnetic field along the flow and leading to a set of only three waves analogous to the ones in relativistic hydrodynamics , as well as generic initial states leading to the full set of seven mhd waves .",
    "the approach discussed for the numerical solution is based on a `` hybrid '' approach which adopts different sets of equations according to the values of the normal magnetic field and that has turned out to be crucial for a successful solution .    the paper is organized as follows : section [ equations ] contains the basic equations of relativistic mhd , while section [ strategy ] describes the strategy used to solve the riemann problem numerically and which combines the methods discussed in section  [ pmethod ] and section  [ btmethod ] .",
    "section [ numerical ] focuses on the details of the numerical implementation and discusses the solution of a number of tests that have become standard references .",
    "finally , the conclusions are collected in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "we use a spacelike signature @xmath2 and a system of units in which @xmath3 .",
    "greek indices are taken to run from 0 to 3 , latin indices from 1 to 3 and we adopt the standard convention for the summation over repeated indices . finally we indicate 3-vectors with an arrow and use bold letters to denote 4-vectors and tensors .",
    "consider an ideal but magnetized relativistic fluid with an energy - momentum tensor given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the rest mass density , @xmath6 the specific internal energy , @xmath7 the gas pressure , @xmath8 the magnetic pressure , @xmath9 the four - velocity , @xmath10 the lorentz factor and the 4-vector @xmath11 has components @xmath12 here @xmath13 is the magnetic field 3-vector and @xmath14    the general relativistic equations of mhd are then simply obtained after requiring the conservation of baryon number @xmath15 where @xmath16 represents a covariant derivative , the conservation of energy and momentum @xmath17 together with the relevant pair of maxwell equations . if the fluid is assumed to have an infinite electrical conductivity ( _ i.e. _ ideal mhd limit ) , the maxwell equations reduce to @xmath18 } = 0 $ ] , where @xmath19 is the faraday tensor and the square brackets refer to antisymmetrised indices .",
    "using the definition ( [ defb ] ) , the maxwell equations can be simply written as @xmath20 the system of equations ( [ barno])([maxwell ] ) is completed with an equation of state ( eos ) relating the pressure to the rest - mass density and/or to the energy density .",
    "although hereafter we will use an ideal - gas eos : @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the polytropic index , the procedure described for the solution of the riemann problem is valid for a generic eos .",
    "we next assume that the system has a planar - symmetry , _ i.e. _ that in a cartesian coordinate system @xmath23 all the variables depend only on @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and that the spacetime is flat so that covariant derivatives in equations  ( [ barno])([maxwell ] ) can be replaced by partial derivatives and @xmath26 for any 3-vector @xmath27 . in this case , the complete set of mhd equations can be written as a set of first - order partial differential equations in a flux - conservative form @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are respectively the vectors of conserved quantities and fluxes , defined as @xmath31 and where the following definitions have been used @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the total specific enthalpy and @xmath34 the one of the gas only .",
    "note that the divergence - free condition for the magnetic field and the maxwell equation for the evolution of the @xmath25-component of the magnetic field imply that @xmath35 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath36 is uniform in space , constant in time and thus always maintains its initial values .",
    "the general riemann problem in relativistic mhd consists of a set of seven nonlinear waves : two _ fast - waves _ ( fw ) , two _ slow - waves _ ( sw ) , two _ alfvn - waves _ ( aw ) , and a _ contact discontinuity _ ( cd ) at which only the density may be discontinuous .",
    "the fast and slow nonlinear waves can be either shocks or rarefaction waves , depending on the change in the pressure and in the norm of the magnetic field across the wave .",
    "building on the experience with relativistic hydrodynamics , our general strategy in the search for the solution consists of expressing all of the variables after each wave as functions of the values of the same variables ahead of the wave and of an unknown variable behind the wave .",
    "when considering the riemann problem in relativistic hydrodynamics , in fact , the solution is found after expressing all of the quantities behind the wave as functions of the value of the pressure at the contact discontinuity . in this way",
    ", the problem is reduced to the search for the value of the pressure that satisfies the jump conditions at the contact discontinuity .",
    "spacetime structure of the mhd riemann problem in the case in which the magnetic field has tangential components only , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath37 .",
    "the `` riemann - fan '' in this case is composed of only two fast - waves ( fw ) and of a central tangential discontinuity ( td ) , thus resembling structure of the riemann problem in pure hydrodynamics",
    ". indicated with r1r4 are the 4 different regions into which the riemann problem can be decomposed , each representing a different state.,height=245 ]    when considering the riemann problem in relativistic mhd , on the other hand , two different cases need to be distinguished . assuming the initial discontinuity to have normal along the @xmath25-axis , the initial magnetic field in this direction can either be zero ( _ i.e. _ @xmath37 ) or not ( _ i.e. _ @xmath38 ) .",
    "in the first case , the structure of the solution is very similar to the hydrodynamical one , with only two fast waves and a _ tangential discontinuity _ along which only the total pressure and the @xmath25 component of the velocity are continuous .",
    "the spacetime structure of the riemann problem in this case is sketched in figure  [ mhd_zones_nullbx ] , where the `` riemann - fan '' is shown to be composed of only two fast - waves ( fw ) and of a central tangential discontinuity ( td ) . because of this analogy , the numerical solution of the riemann problem when @xmath37 follows the same procedure implemented in relativistic hydrodynamics .",
    "we refer to this as the `` total - pressure approach '' or simply , the _ `` p - method''_.    a detailed investigation of the exact solution of the riemann problem with tangential magnetic fields and when the additional condition @xmath39 is imposed , has been recently proposed by romero et al .",
    "( 2005 ) . among the many points",
    "discussed , this work has shown that when @xmath40 the riemann problem in relativistic mhd can be assimilated to the one in relativistic hydrodynamics and that all of the corrections introduced by the magnetic field can be incorporated in the definition of a new , effective eos .    in the second case ,",
    "on the other hand , the riemann problem is considerably more complex and all of the seven waves are allowed to form when the initial discontinuity is removed .",
    "the spacetime structure of the riemann problem in this case is sketched in figure  [ mhd_zones ] , where the `` riemann - fan '' is shown to be composed of two fast - waves ( fw ) , of two alfvn waves ( aw ) , of two slow - waves ( sw ) and of a central contact discontinuity ( cd ) .",
    "it is important to bear in mind that across the alfvn discontinuities only the total pressure , the gas pressure and the density are continuous , while there could be jumps in the other quantities . as a result , if the total pressure is used as unknown , there would be three different values for the total pressure ( two between the fast and the slow - waves and one between the two slow - waves ) but five conditions to be satisfied at the contact discontinuity : the continuity of the three components of the velocity and the continuity of the tangential components of the magnetic field .",
    "the resulting system of five equations in three unknowns is over - constrained and there is no guarantee that a global convergent solution is found at the contact discontinuity .",
    "indeed , experience has shown that small numerical imprecisions at the level of round - off errors are in general sufficient to prevent the simultaneous solution of the five constraints .",
    "spacetime structure of the mhd riemann problem in the general case in which the magnetic field has also a normal component , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath38 .",
    "the `` riemann - fan '' is here composed of two fast - waves ( fw ) , of two alfvn waves ( aw ) , of two slow - waves ( sw ) and of a central contact discontinuity ( cd )",
    ". indicated with r1r8 are the 8 different regions into which the riemann problem can be decomposed , each representing a different state .",
    "indicated are also the different methods used to compute the solutions in the different regions ( _ i.e. _ @xmath41-method in regions r4 and r5 and @xmath42-method in regions r2-r3 and r6-r7).,height=245 ]    to circumvent this difficulty and inspired by the procedure followed in the exact solution of the corresponding riemann solver in nonrelativistic mhd ( @xcite ) , when @xmath43 we have implemented a `` hybrid '' approach in which the total pressure is used as the unknown variable between the fast and the slow waves ( _ i.e. _ in regions r2-r3 , and r6-r7 of figure  [ mhd_zones ] ) , while the tangential components of the magnetic fields ( @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) is used between the slow waves ( _ i.e. _ in regions r4-r5 of figure  [ mhd_zones ] ) . in this way , the continuity of the tangential components of the magnetic field @xmath44 and @xmath45 is automatically guaranteed through the contact discontinuity and only the continuity of the total pressure and of the three components of the velocity needs to be satisfied .",
    "the resulting system consists of four equations in four unknowns and , being closed , it can be solved numerically through root - finding techniques for nonlinear system of equations ( _ e.g. _ using a newton - raphson method ) .",
    "we refer to this as the `` tangential magnetic field approach '' or simply , the _ `` @xmath41-method''_.    as mentioned in the introduction , hereafter we will assume that the riemann problem has a solution and that this is unique . as a result , we will not discuss in any detail compound waves which seem to develop in the numerical solution of some special initial states ( one of these is shown in section  [ num_bxneq0_tests ] ) and whose admissibility as solution of the riemann problem is still debated .",
    "in the following sections we describe in detail the approach in which we calculate all of the variables in the riemann fan using as unknown the total pressure , _ i.e. _ the @xmath42-method .",

    "as mentioned in the introduction , much of the inspiration in the development and use of this method comes from the corresponding approach developed by ryu and jones ( 1995 ) in nonrelativistic mhd .",

    "the problem can be solved using the norm of the tangential component of the magnetic field @xmath108 and the rotation angle @xmath109 across alfvn discontinuities .",

    ", the relevant system of equations is solved using as unknowns the values of @xmath41 in regions r2-r3 , r4-r5 , r6-r7 of the riemann fan in figure  [ mhd_zones ] and the angle @xmath110 in regions r3-r6 . at the contact discontinuity it is then necessary to solve a system of four equations , given by the continuity of @xmath104 and of @xmath42 , in the same four unknowns .",
    "this can be solved using root - finding techniques such as the newton - raphson method . finally , when @xmath111 , the presence of only two fast waves and a tangential discontinuity makes the solution of the problem even simpler ( see ryu and jones 1995 for details ) .",
    "in relativistic mhd , on the other hand , the value of @xmath41 can be discontinuous across alfvn waves and the angle @xmath110 can vary across fast and slow - waves ; it is then not possible to solve the system using the same method .",
    "note also that the equations reported below both for shock and rarefactions waves are strictly valid only if @xmath38 and indeed should be used only in regions r4 and r5 of the riemann fan shown in figure  [ mhd_zones ] . in these regions ,",
    "only slow - waves are present and these do not appear when @xmath37 .      to calculate the solution across a shock front within the @xmath41-method",

    "an analytic solution for the post - shock value of @xmath119 in terms of the other post - shock quantities was sought but not found , forcing to the numerical solution of one of the equations ( [ eqs3])([eqs5 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , in analogy with what done in the @xmath42-method , we calculate the value of the shock velocity by solving numerically equation ( [ vs1 ] )",
    ".    finally , it may be useful to point out that the numerical solution of equation ( [ vs1 ] ) is at times complicated by the existence of two acceptable roots in the interval of velocities in which the value of the slow shock velocity has to be found ( _ i.e. _ between the value of @xmath119 and the value of the alfvn velocity ) . because only one of these two roots will lead to a convergent exact solution , a careful selection needs to be made .",
    "the existence of these two roots could be related to a known problem in newtonian mhd where the use of the tangential components of the magnetic field as the post - shock independent variables can lead to the presence of more than one solution ( _ cf .",
    "_ , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "this problem seems to be present also in relativistic mhd ( @xcite ) , but it has not represented a serious drawback for the approach followed here . more work is needed to determine whether the use of the tangential components of the magnetic field as the post - shock independent variables is really optimal or whether different choices are preferable .      to calculate the solution across a rarefaction wave within the @xmath41-method we use the same set of odes ( [ r1])([r8 ] ) discussed in section  [ sarw_pm ] , with the only but important difference that we do not use @xmath96 as self - similar variable but , rather , the norm of the tangential components of the magnetic field @xmath41 . more specifically , we use equations ( [ r1])([r3 ] ) together with equations ( [ r7])([r8 ] ) and substitute the derivative with respect to @xmath96 with the one with respect to @xmath41 .",
    "in addition to these equations , which provide a solution for variables @xmath121 and @xmath113 , we express explicitly the relation between the norm and the tangential components in terms of the angle @xmath110 @xmath122 and rewrite them as odes having @xmath41 as the self - similar variable @xmath123 note that in deriving equations ( [ constpsi1])([constpsi2 ] ) , an implicit assumption has been made : _",
    "i.e. _ that the angle @xmath110 is constant across the rarefaction wave and thus that the tangential magnetic field does not rotate across the rarefaction wave . with the use of the supplementary equations ( [ constpsi1])([constpsi2 ] ) ,",
    "the resulting system of odes is complete and can be solved numerically using standard techniques for the solution of a system of coupled odes . in practice ,",
    "the integration is started ahead of the rarefaction and is progressed toward the contact discontinuity , where @xmath41 is given by the values of @xmath44 and @xmath45 chosen at the contact discontinuity .",
    "in all of the tests reported here ( with the exception of test number 5 of balsara 2001 ; see section  [ num_bxneq0_tests ] for a discussion ) , the assumption @xmath124 is valid .",
    "this is probably related to the choice of the initial conditions used in these tests and in particular to the fact that @xmath125 , @xmath126 , or @xmath127 , where @xmath128_left _ , _",
    "right_@xmath129 , so that the initial states are essentially invariant after the exchange of @xmath130 with @xmath131 or the @xmath131 components of @xmath132 and @xmath133 remain equal to zero in all the regions .",
    "it should be noted that also in relativistic hydrodynamics the velocity components tangential to a nonlinear wave can change their norm across the wave , in contrast with what happens in newtonian hydrodynamics .",
    "considering for simplicity the case for a shock wave in the limit of zero magnetic field , equations ( [ eqs4])([eqs5 ] ) reduce to @xmath134 = 0 = [ [ s^z / d]]$ ] , indicating that the ratio @xmath135 remains unchanged through shocks so that the tangential velocity 3-vector can change its norm but does not rotate .",
    "this property , which applies also across rarefaction waves , is not present across newtonian nonlinear waves , in which the tangential 3-velocity vector does not rotate , nor changes its norm : @xmath136= 0 = [ [ v^z]]$ ] .",
    "although the condition @xmath124 is exact in nonrelativistic mhd , it may not be valid in relativistic regimes , where the tangential magnetic field is instead free to rotate across the slow rarefaction . in this case",
    ", a new strategy needs to be implemented and the simplest one consists of using the angle @xmath110 as the self - similar variable so that the system of equations ( [ r1])([r8 ] ) can be expressed in terms of this new integration variable .",
    "in addition , the supplementary differential equation for one of the components of the tangential magnetic field can be obtained through the algebraic relation @xmath137 and its derivative with respect to @xmath110 @xmath138 the integration of the system of odes is done starting from the value of @xmath110 given by the ratio of the tangential components of the magnetic field ahead of the rarefaction wave , up to the value given by the amplitudes of @xmath44 and @xmath45 at the contact discontinuity .",
    "furthermore , as for the @xmath42-method , also within the @xmath41-method the values of the variable @xmath96 are obtained from the quartic equation ( [ quartic ] ) .",
    "a representative example of this effect is shown in figure  [ bg_al1_normb ] , where we plot the exact solution of the generic alfvn test at time @xmath139 ( _ cf . _ table  [ tab : tests ] for the initial conditions of this test ) .",
    "in particular , the left panel of figure  [ bg_al1_normb ] shows the norm of the tangential magnetic field @xmath41 , while the right panel the angle @xmath140 .",
    "note how both quantities vary across all the fast , slow and alfvn waves .",
    "since the properties of the magnetic field components in the initial states lead to considerably different riemann problems ( _ cf .",
    "_ the two riemann fans in figures  [ mhd_zones_nullbx ] and  [ mhd_zones ] ) , we will discuss separately the numerical solution in the cases in which @xmath37 and @xmath38 , emphasizing the properties of some of the most representative tests .      as discussed in section  [ strategy ] ,",
    "when @xmath37 the riemann problem consists of only two fast - waves and of a tangential discontinuity across which only @xmath119 and @xmath42 are continuous ( _ cf .",
    "_ figure  [ mhd_zones_nullbx ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that the condition of continuity of the total pressure across the tangential discontinuity does not necessarily extend also to the gas pressure and , indeed , the latter is in general discontinuous ( _ cf .",
    "_ figures  [ kost2 ] and  [ bg1 ] ) .",
    "in essence , the numerical solution of the riemann problem when @xmath37 proceeds as follows : given the initial left and right states ( _ i.e. _ regions r1 and r4 of figure  [ mhd_zones_nullbx ] ) , we follow the procedure used in relativistic hydrodynamics and determine two unknown states as function of the common total pressure in regions r2 and r3 ( @xmath42-method ) . the jump in the normal component of the velocity at the tangential discontinuity",
    "is then checked and a new guess for the total pressure found .",
    "this procedure is iterated until the solution is found with the desired accuracy .",
    "the numerical approach used is a combination of newton - raphson and bisection methods , starting from a value for the total pressure which is the average of the initial left and right states .",
    "furthermore , to decide whether the wave considered is a shock or a rarefaction , we compare the values of the total pressure ahead of and behind the wave , solving the set of equations across a shock if the guessed value is larger than the total pressure ahead of the wave and thus in the initial state .",
    "we note that this procedure could be improved if an approach similar to the one discussed by rezzolla et al .",
    "( 2001 , 2003 ) is implemented , which would exploit the values of the initial relative velocity to predict the wave - pattern produced .",
    "it is also worth noting that even though the numerical strategy discussed so far is very similar to the one used in relativistic hydrodynamics , the equations to be solved in mhd are much more complex and , more importantly , their computational cost markedly larger .",

    "in essence , the numerical solution of the riemann problem when @xmath38 proceeds as follows : starting from the initial left and right states ( _ i.e. _ regions r1 and r8 of figure  [ mhd_zones ] ) , we compute the states after the fast - waves ( regions r2 and r7 ) , then we determine the jumps across the alfvn discontinuities ( regions r3 and r6 ) and finally we solve the equations for the slow - waves ( regions r4 and r5 ) . as a result of this sequence , the jump conditions in all the physical variables in the two states across the contact discontinuity are computed and if the solution obtained in this way does not reach the desired accuracy , the procedure is iterated .",
    "we also recall that when @xmath38 , the numerical solution is found using a hybrid method which adopts different sets of equations according to the region in which the riemann problem has to be solved . in particular , to compute the states after the fast - waves and across the alfvn discontinuities we use as unknown the total pressure ( @xmath42-method ; section  [ pmethod ] ) and to discriminate between shocks and rarefaction waves we evaluate the jump in the total pressure in a way similar to the case when @xmath37 .",
    "to compute the states after the slow - waves , on the other hand , we use the tangential components of the magnetic field ( @xmath41-method ; section  [ btmethod ] ) and to decide whether a wave is a shock or a rarefaction we evaluate the jump in the norm of the magnetic field bearing in mind that it must decrease across slow shocks and increase otherwise . then at the contact discontinuity",
    "we compute the jumps in the total pressure and in the components of three - velocity and if they are above a certain accuracy we iterate by changing the values of the total pressure , used in regions r2-r3 and r6-r7 , and of the tangential components of the magnetic field , used in regions r4-r5 .",
    "it is worth underlining that the solution of the riemann problem with generic initial states is considerably more demanding than when @xmath37 and not only because of the more numerous waves present .",
    "indeed , the most severe difficulty is due to the fact that the set of equations to be solved becomes particularly stiff near the solution .",
    "a careful investigation of the several cases considered has in fact revealed that , in general , the functional behavior of the quantities whose roots are sought , changes very rapidly near the roots , stretching the ability of standards root - finding algorithms . as a result , it is not uncommon that the solution can not be found if the iteration for the search of the root starts from a guess which is not sufficiently close to the exact solution . to avoid such failures and to provide a first guess which is reasonably accurate , we have used as a guide the solution provided by the hlle approximate riemann solver since in this case the solution can also be quite far from the exact one and yet the iterative scheme does not show problems in converging to it . ] . in practice , the approximate solution should be accurate to a few percent in the regions away from the waves , where the states are almost constant ( very close to the waves the errors are of course much larger ) . using this guess",
    "has proven to be sufficient to obtain a solution in all of the cases considered , but of course there is no guarantee that a solution will be straightforwardly found for all of the possible initial states .",
    "our experience when the solution could not be immediately obtained is that an increase in the accuracy of the approximate riemann solver is in general sufficient to yield a convergent and accurate solution .",

    "the only exception to this has been test number 1 of balsara ( 2001 ) which represents the relativistic version of the test proposed by brio - wu ( 1988 ) in newtonian hydrodynamics ( @xcite ) .",
    "the approximate numerical solution of this test , in fact , shows the development of a left - going slow compound - wave , that is a wave composed by a slow shock adjacent to a slow rarefaction .",
    "since we assume that a slow or fast - wave can either be a pure rarefaction or a pure shock , compound structures of this type can not be found by construction and thus are not present in the exact solution found ( _ cf . _ table  [ tab : balsara1 ] and figure  [ ba1 ] ) .",
    "we remark that it is not yet clear whether compound waves have to be considered acceptable physical solutions of the ideal mhd equations and a debate on this is still ongoing ( see , for instance ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we here prefer to adopt the same standpoint of ryu and jones ( 1995 ) in the development of their exact riemann solver in nonrelativistic magnetohydrodynamics and not comment further on this until a commonly accepted view has emerged .",
    "another test which deserves a special comment is test number 5 of balsara ( 2001 ) , in which the left - going alfvn discontinuity and the left - going slow rarefaction wave have very similar propagation velocities .",
    "indeed they are so close to each other that not even the hlle approximate riemann solver with 40000 gridpoints was able to capture the precise location of the discontinuity . as a consequence ,",
    "the initial guess for the jumps across the left - going alfvn discontinuity was sufficiently good to yield a convergent solution , but not good enough to provide an exact solution with a truncation error comparable with the one reached in all of the other tests ( _ cf .",
    "_ data in table  [ tab : balsara5 ] ) .",
    "in addition , another distinctive feature of this test and which has not been found in any of the others , is the rotation of the angle @xmath110 across the left - going slow rarefaction . to handle this",
    "we have followed the procedure discussed in section  [ sarw ] and used equation ( [ eq : psi ] ) to compute the changes in the tangential magnetic field across the rarefaction wave .",

    "we have presented the procedure for the solution of the exact riemann problem in special relativistic mhd .",
    "special care has been paid in treating both degenerate initial states ( _ i.e. _ with zero normal magnetic field ) leading to a set of only three waves analogous to the ones in relativistic hydrodynamics , as well as generic initial states ( _ i.e. _ with nonzero normal magnetic field ) leading to the full set of seven mhd waves .",
    "the approach discussed for the numerical solution of the exact riemann problem reflects this distinction and different sets of equations are used according to the values of the normal magnetic field . in particular , when @xmath37 , all of the equations needed for the solution of the riemann problem are written as a function of the total pressure , thus following a procedure which is logically equivalent to the one adopted in relativistic hydrodynamics ( we have referred to this as to the @xmath42-method ) . when @xmath38 , on the other hand , an hybrid approach is adopted in which the solution across fast - waves and alfvn discontinuities is still computed using the @xmath42-method , but the one across slow - waves and the contact discontinuity is computed using equations which are written in terms of the tangential components of the magnetic field ( we have referred to this as to the @xmath41-method ) .",
    "the use of a combined approach for the general case of @xmath38 has turned out to be crucial for a successful solution of the problem .",
    "because of its generality , the solution presented here could serve as a useful if not indispensable test for those numerical codes that solve the mhd equations in relativistic regimes .",
    "as the astronomical observations become increasingly more accurate , such numerical codes will become increasingly more important to explain and describe in detail the complex physics of astrophysical compact objects .",
    "as a final remark we note that despite the considerable improvements in the performance of modern computers , the exact solution of the riemann problem at each grid interface is still computationally too expensive to be used routinely in sophisticated multidimensional numerical codes solving the equations of relativistic hydrodynamics or mhd in either stationary or dynamical spacetimes ( see , for instance , baiotti et al .",
    "2005 , duez et al .",
    "while a numerical code based on exact riemann solvers may represent at least in principle the most accurate approach to the solution of the hydrodynamics and mhd equations , considerable work is still required to make it competitive with less accurate but more computationally efficient methods .",
    "a first step in this direction would be , for instance , the search for an analytic solution for the shock velocity and this will be the subject of future work .",
    "another important problem deserving equal attention is that of the uniqueness of the solution . while a global consensus on this issue still needs to be reached , it will remain essential in order to construct a complete and consistent picture of the exact solution of the riemann problem in relativistic mhd .    the numerical codes computing the exact solution both when @xmath37 and when @xmath155 are available from the authors upon request .",
    "users of the codes can give credit by mentioning the source and citing this paper .",
