    "the energy minimization scheme is formulated in terms of an equation of motion ( eom ) for the wave function @xmath67 .",

    "though conjugate gradient techniques need a smaller number of iterations to minimize the energy functional , they need to perform an accurate line minimization and have to calculate the conjugate search directions making this algorithm rather costly compared to the calculation of the steepest descent direction .",

    ". consequently , less iterations are necessary when the initial wave function is obtained in a more physical way , i.e. by a direct diagonalization of the kohn - sham hamiltonian . the effort to diagonalize the kohn - sham hamiltonian on the full basis , however , outweighs the effort saved in the iterative diagonalization . instead",
    ", a very efficient procedure is to represent the kohn - sham orbitals @xmath90 in a lcao or mixed - basis - set which dramatically reduces the number of basis functions and at the same time gives a good approximation to the solution within the full basis  @xcite . in this basis",

    "the portability of the code to a variety of platforms without loosing efficiency is achieved by using standard library subroutines like blas - routines . in this way on each platform full advantage can be taken of optimized , platform specific implementations of the libraries . however ,",
    "when such libraries are not available ( e.g. on a pc ) we provide the necessary routines in a separate library which can be linked to the program .    in typical applications",

    "e.g. a silicon super cell with 128 atoms and more , the calculation of the ( non - local contributions of the ) atomic forces ( which scale like @xmath101 becomes the dominant contribution .",
    "the computational effort for this contribution is dramatically reduced by calculating the forces only for the last few electronic steps , when the born - oppenheimer surface is almost reached .",

    "[ sec : elproblem ] the atomic eoms are integrated with standard md techniques . we have implemented two schemes , the verlet algorithm and a predictor - corrector algorithm .",
    "the choice of the scheme depends on the actual type of application .",
    "for example , the verlet algorithm is more stable with respect to an energy drift than the predictor - corrector algorithm .",
    "however , when it is important to obtain very accurate velocities , the predictor - corrector algorithm should be employed .",
    "the verlet algorithm  @xcite is @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the mass of the nuclei and @xmath104 is the time step . from a numerical point of view",
    "it is desirable to chose a time step @xmath104 as large as possible .",
    "a good choice for @xmath104 is @xmath105 of the shortest phonon period in the system , which is approximately _",
    "one _ order of magnitude larger than the time step used in the car - parrinello _ ab initio _",
    "md  @xcite .",
    "the time step there is limited by the fast oscillatory motion of the electrons in the fictitious electron dynamics  @xcite , which originates from the need to keep the electrons close to the born - oppenheimer surface .",
    "the velocity @xmath106 of a nucleus is calculated by @xmath107 which is correct to second order in @xmath108  @xcite .",
    "note that the velocities are not directly integrated by the algorithm , but obtained from the trajectory itself .    in a predictor - corrector scheme",
    "the discretization error is of higher order in @xmath104 than that of the verlet algorithm .",
    "the usual predictor - corrector ( pc ) schemes employ an extrapolation step to predict positions and velocities , which are then corrected in the corrector step . for small time steps the accuracy of the pc scheme is much higher than that of the verlet algorithm .",
    "however , for a large time step it looses this advantage  @xcite , since the error in the extrapolation step increases strongly with an increasing time step .",
    "therefore we have implemented a predictor - corrector scheme which avoids the extrapolation . in this scheme",
    "an adams - bashforth predictor step @xmath109 is followed by an adams - moulton corrector step @xmath110 with the coefficients @xmath111 and @xmath112 as tabulated in ref .",

    "though in this scheme the forces have to be re - calculated after the corrector step , this is inexpensively done as the corrector step corrects the positions of the nuclei only slightly and convergent forces are typically obtained within a few iterative steps .",
    "thus the accuracy of the predictor - corrector scheme does not suffer from a large time step .",
    "moreover , the velocities are smooth functions of time and the total - energy of the coupled electron nuclei system is practically free from fluctuations .",
    "energy losses encountered in long simulations within the micro - canonical ensemble can be compensated by a periodic rescaling of the atomic velocities according to a preset average kinetic energy per particle .",
    "temperature is optionally enabled by a nos - hoover thermostat  @xcite .",
    "one additional degree of freedom is employed to simulate the heat bath and an extra force is accelerating or de - accelerating the nuclei to maintain the temperature of the system .",
    "the modified eoms of the extended system are @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the number of independent degrees of freedom in the system .",
    "the initial coordinates and velocities of all independent degrees of freedom completely determine the trajectory .",
    "the initial velocities are generated from gaussian distributed random numbers such that the center of mass is at rest and that the kinetic energy of the system corresponds to an initial temperature . in a micro - canonical ensemble the initial temperature together with the potential energy of the initial configuration of the nuclei determine the resulting average kinetic energy per particle .",
    "both schemes , the verlet algorithm and the predictor - corrector scheme , require knowledge of the trajectory at previous time steps .",
    "therefore , to start these algorithms , the runge - kutta scheme  @xcite is used to integrate the equation of motion for the first few time steps .      an efficient and numerically stable method to find the equilibrium geometry is damped newton dynamics . starting from an initial configuration the nuclei",
