    "the lack of observational constraints leads to serious uncertainties in the modeling of stellar interiors .",
    "the measurement and characterization of oscillation modes is an ideal tool to test models of stellar inner structure and theories of stellar evolution .",
    "indeed , the five - minute oscillations in the sun have led to a wealth of information about the solar interior .",
    "these results stimulated various attempts to detect a similar signal on other solar - like stars .",
    "solar  like oscillation modes generate periodic motions of the stellar surface with periods in the range of 360 minutes but with extremely small amplitudes .",
    "essentially , two methods exist to detect such a motion : photometry and doppler spectroscopy . in photometry , the oscillation amplitudes of solar  like stars are within 230  ppm , while they are in the range of 10150  cms@xmath1 in radial velocity measurements .",
    "photometric measurements made from the ground are strongly limited by scintillation noise . to reach the needed accuracy",
    "requires observations made from space .",
    "in contrast , doppler ground  based measurements have recently shown their ability to detect oscillation modes in solar  like stars .",
    "these past years , the stabilized spectrographs developed for extra - solar planet detection achieved accuracies needed for solar - like oscillation detection by means of radial velocity measurements @xcite .    a primary target for the search for @xmath0-mode oscillations is the bright dwarf f9 ( hr  4540 , hd  102870 , m@xmath6=3.61 ) .",
    "scaling from the solar case , @xmath0-modes are expected near @xmath7=1.4mhz with a large frequency spacing of about @xmath8=71@xmath3hz , and a maximal amplitude of a@xmath9=65cms@xmath1 @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we report doppler observations of made with the coralie spectrograph , well known for the characterization of p ",
    "modes on the @xmath10 cen system @xcite .",
    "these measurements enable the identification of thirty - one individual mode frequencies .",
    "was observed over a campaign of eleven nights ( 2003 february 28 - march 10 ) with coralie , the high - resolution fiber - fed echelle spectrograph mounted on the 1.2-m swiss telescope at la silla ( eso , chile ) . during the stellar exposures , the spectrum of a thorium lamp carried by a second fiber is simultaneously recorded in order to monitor the spectrograph s stability and thus to obtain high - precision velocity measurements .",
    "the wavelength coverage of the spectra is 3875 - 6820 , recorded on 68 orders .",
    "the dead - time between two exposures was improved from the usual 125s to 85s , by archiving the image during the following exposure .",
    "exposure times of 120s , thus cycles of 205s , allowed us to obtain 1293 spectra , with a typical signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) in the range of 100140 at 550 nm .",
    ".distribution and dispersion of doppler measurements [ cols=\"^,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      +    [ tab : freq ]    the echelle diagram showing the thirty - one identified modes is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ed ] .",
    "the frequencies of the modes are shown in fig .",
    "[ tfiden ] and are given in table  [ tab : freq ] , with radial order of each oscillation mode deduced from the asymptotic relation ( see eq .",
    "1 ) assuming that the parameter @xmath11 is near the solar value ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the average large spacing and the parameters @xmath13 and @xmath11 are thus deduced from a least - squares fit of this equation with the frequencies of table  [ tab : freq ] .",
    "the average small spacing is here defined as @xmath14 ( the perfect asymptotic case , with constant large and small separations ) : @xmath15 @xmath16    the small spacing appears to decrease from 7.4 to 4.9@xmath3hz between 1260 and 1700@xmath3hz . has a projected rotational velocity of about @xmath17@xmath18@xmath19@xmath204.3kms@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "we can estimate its radius to @xmath21=1.66@xmath22 from @xmath23=3.51@xmath24 ( hipparcos data ) and @xmath25=6140k @xcite .",
    "assuming an uniform rotation , we determine the corresponding splitting of the modes to be at least 0.56@xmath3hz ( for @xmath18@xmath19=1 ) .",
    "this splitting can increase the uncertainty of the mode frequencies .",
    "@xmath26 modes can thus be shifted by at least @xmath270.56@xmath3hz , this effect is worse on @xmath28 modes ( twice this value ) .",
    "indeed , the dispersions of @xmath28 and @xmath26 modes are greater than for @xmath29 modes ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ed ] and table  [ tab : freq ] with the larger errors on @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) .",
    "moreover , two high @xmath28 modes were determined with a same radial order ( 1478.5 and 1479.9@xmath3hz ) , this could be explained by such a splitting , implying an angle @xmath19 near 53 , however , with a high uncertainty .",
    "both @xmath32 modes at 731.7 and 803.0@xmath3hz could be shifted by 11.57@xmath3hz .",
    "they were fixed to their value in order to follow the slight curvature present for @xmath33 modes at low frequency .",
    "they have to be taken with some caution .      concerning the amplitudes of the modes , theoretical computations predict oscillation amplitudes near 50cms@xmath1 for a 1.25 @xmath34 star like , with mode lifetimes of the order of several days to several tenth of days .",
    "the amplitudes of the highest modes , in the range 3246cms@xmath1 , are then slightly lower than expected .",
    "the observations indicate that oscillation amplitudes are typically 1.52 times solar .",
    "this disagreement can be partly explained by the lifetimes of the modes .",
    "indeed , the oscillation modes have finite lifetimes , because they are continuously damped . thus ,",
    "if the star is observed during a time longer than the lifetimes of the modes , the signal is weakened due to the damping of the modes and to their re  excitation with a random phase .",
    "the radial velocity measurements of , obtained over 11 nights , show a significant excess in the power spectrum between 0.72.4mhz , centered around 1.4  mhz , with a maximal peak amplitude of 45cms@xmath1 , revealing solar  like oscillations .",
    "moreover , we presented the identification of thirty - one individual frequencies . note that this identification is a little complicated by the presence of rotational splitting , as rotates rapidly enough to see this effect .",
    "the signal - to - noise of our data is unfortunately not high enough to unambiguously determine this splitting .",
    "the oscillation modes present an average large spacing of 72.1@xmath3hz , and the small spacing appears to decrease from 7.4 to 4.9@xmath3hz between 1260 and 1700@xmath3hz , with an average of 6.3@xmath3hz . as the large spacing is related to @xmath35 @xcite , the mass of should be close to 1.3m@xmath36",
