    "extending the standard model to accommodate @xmath2 data naturally opens the possibility of many other new phenomena . embedding a type - i seesaw in supersymmetric ( susy ) models provides a unique framework where many theoretical and experimentally shortcomings of the standard model can be successfully addressed . within a type - i susy seesaw ,",
    "even if the soft supersymmetry breaking terms are flavour universal at some high energy unification scale , flavour violation appears at low - energies due to the renormalisation group ( rg ) evolution of the susy soft - breaking parameters , driven by the potentially large and necessarily non - diagonal neutrino yukawa couplings  @xcite .",
    "low - energy manifestations of lfv in the framework of the susy seesaw include sizable branching ratios ( br ) for radiative decays as @xmath3 , three - body decays , @xmath4 and sizable @xmath5 conversion rates ( cr ) in heavy nuclei ( for a review , see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .    at the lhc ,",
    "processes such as slepton mediated neutralino decays @xmath6 offer a golden laboratory to study lepton flavour violation at higher energies .",
    "three possible signals of lfv can be observed at the lhc : ( i ) flavoured slepton mass splittings , provided that one can effectively reconstruct slepton masses via observables such as the kinematic end - point of the invariant mass distribution of the leptons coming from the above mentioned cascade decay ; ( ii ) multiple edges in di - lepton invariant mass distributions @xmath7 , arising from the exchange of a different flavour slepton @xmath8 ( in addition to the left- and right - handed sleptons , @xmath9 ) ; ( iii ) sizable widths for lfv decay processes like @xmath6 .",
    "our analysis  @xcite is focused on how the confrontation of slepton mass splittings and of low - energy lfv observables may provide important information about the underlying mechanism of lfv .",
    "our analysis is conducted in the framework of the cmssm extended by three right - handed neutrino superfields , so that the leptonic part of the superpotential is given by @xmath10 , where the neutrino yukawa couplings @xmath11 and the majorana mass @xmath12 matrix are assumed to be diagonal in flavour space ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 @xmath15 ) , without loss of generality .",
    "new terms are also added to the soft - susy breaking lagragian , and universality of the soft - susy breaking parameters is assumed at some high - energy scale , choosen to be the gauge coupling unification scale @xmath16 gev . in the so - called seesaw limit , one has the usual seesaw equation for the light neutrino masses @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the vacuum expectation values of the neutral higgs scalars , @xmath20 , with @xmath21 gev .",
    "a convenient means of parametrizing the neutrino yukawa couplings , while at the same time allowing to accommodate the experimental data , is given by the casas - ibarra parametrization  @xcite , which reads at the seesaw scale @xmath12 @xmath22 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : seesaw : casas ] ) @xmath23 is a @xmath24 complex orthogonal matrix ( parametrized by 3 complex angles @xmath25 ) , that encodes the possible mixings involving the right - handed neutrinos , in addition to those of the low - energy sector ( i.e. @xmath26 ) .",
    "we use the standard parametrization of the @xmath26 , with the three mixing angles in the intervals favoured by current best - fit analyses  @xcite .      in the presence of mixings in the lepton sector",
    ", @xmath27 is clearly non - diagonal in flavour space , and the running from @xmath28 down to the seesaw scale will induce flavour mixing in the otherwise ( approximately ) flavour conserving susy breaking terms .",
    "as an example , at low energies the slepton - doublet soft - breaking mass , @xmath29 ( which at the gut scale is @xmath30 ) now reads @xmath31 @xmath32 where @xmath33 . hence , slepton mass matrices are non - diagonal , and there is a misalignement between slepton mass and interaction eigenstates .",
    "notice that in the framework of the susy seesaw , there is only one source of ( s)lepton flavour violation : the neutrino yukawa couplings , @xmath27 .",
    "flavour violating transitions can occur in the charged slepton sector , giving rise to low - energy lfv observables such as @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 conversion in nuclei .      within the cmssm , and in the absence of explicit mixing in the slepton sector , there are only two sources of non - universality for the masses of left- and right - handed sleptons : ( i ) rge effects proportional to @xmath34 ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : slepton : rge : llog ] ) ) ; ( ii ) @xmath35 mixing effects , also proportional to the lepton masses ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "hence , the cmssm mass differences between the first two families are extremely small implying that , to a large extent , the left- and right - handed selectrons and smuons are nearly degenerate , the mass splitting typically lying at the per mille level .    in the susy",
    "seesaw , the radiative corrections introduced by the neutrino yukawa couplings induce both flavour conserving and flavour violating contributions to the slepton soft masses : in addition to generating lfv effects , the new terms proportional to @xmath27 will also break the approximate universality of the first two generations .",
    "an augmented mixing between @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 translates into larger mass splittings for the mass eigenstates .",
    "in particular , as noticed in  @xcite , large mixings involving the third generation can lead to sizable values of the mass splitting between slepton mass eigenstates , while avoiding the stringent br(@xmath40 ) constraint . in the latter case ( i.e. large @xmath41 )",
    ", the mass splittings between left - handed sleptons of the first two generations are given by @xmath42 and can be sizable , well within the expected sensitivity of the lhc  @xcite . furthermore , notice that in the framework of the susy seesaw , large slepton mass splittings only emerge for the left - handed sleptons ( @xmath43 and @xmath44 remain approximately degenerate ) .    in the cmssm ,",
    "the decays of the @xmath45 into a di - lepton final state @xmath46 are flavour conserving , implying that if measurable , the kinematical edges of a di - lepton mass distribution , @xmath47 necessarily lead to the reconstruction of intermediate sleptons of the same flavour , @xmath48 .",
    "susy models violating strict lepton flavour symmetry may leave distinct imprints on the di - lepton mass distribution , depending on whether the soft - breaking slepton terms are non - universal ( but flavour conserving ) or truly flavour - violating . in the first case",
    ", the most significant effect will be a visible displacement of the kinematical edges in each of the di - lepton distributions : for instance , the edge corresponding to @xmath49 in @xmath50 will not appear at the same values as that of @xmath51 in @xmath52 , implying that @xmath53 .",
    "the second case will lead to far richer imprints : in addition to a relative displacement of the @xmath54 in the corresponding @xmath47 distributions , the most striking effect is the appearance of new edges in a di - lepton mass distribution : provided there is a large flavour mixing in the mass eigenstates ( and that all the decays are kinematically viable ) , one can have @xmath55 so that in addition to the two @xmath56 edges , a new one would appear due to the exchange of @xmath57 .",
    "having a unique source of flavour violation implies that the high - energy lfv observables , @xmath58 , are strongly correlated with the low - energy ones ( brs and cr ) . in the absence of a direct means of testing the susy seesaw , the interplay of these sets of observables may allow to either strengthen the seesaw hypothesis , or even disfavour the seesaw ( thus suggesting additional or even distinct sources of flavour violation ) .",
    "the identification of the several high - energy lfv observables at the lhc implies that several requirements must be met .",
    "first of all , the spectrum must be such that the decay chain @xmath59 , with intermediate real ( on - shell ) sleptons , is allowed ; secondly , the outgoing leptons should be sufficiently hard : @xmath60 gev ; moreover , the @xmath45 production rates , and the br(@xmath61 ) must be large enough to ensure that a significant number of events is likely to be observed at the lhc .",
    "the above requirements impose strong constraints on the cmssm parameters ( i.e. on @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 ) . in  @xcite ,",
    "the cmssm parameter space was thouroughly investigated , leading to the identification of regions where the slepton masses could be successfully reconstructed .",
    "this study allowed to identify several benchmark points ( to which two lhc ones were added ) , which were used in the numerical studies .",
    ".msugra benchmark points selected for the lfv analysis : @xmath62 , @xmath63 ( in gev ) and @xmath64 ( in tev ) , and @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "hm1 and su1 are lhc cms- and atlas - proposed benchmark points  @xcite . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +    if such events are indeed observable , and successfully reconstructed , one expects a 0.1% precision in the measurement of the kinematical edges of the di - lepton invariant mass distributions  @xcite , @xmath68 . in turn",
    ", this will allow to infer the slepton mass differences with a precision of @xmath69 for a @xmath70 relative mass difference  @xcite ; in our analysis we adopted a more conservative view , assuming maximal sensitivities of @xmath71 for @xmath72 and @xmath73 for @xmath74 .      in the framework of the cmssm ( without a seesaw mechanism )",
    ", the dilepton invariant mass distribution ( @xmath75 ) for the study points of table  [ table : cmssm : di - lepton : values ] leads to double triangular distributions ( except for point p1 ) , with superimposed edges corresponding to the exchange of left- and right - handed selectrons and smuons  @xcite .",
    "the numerical scans of the parameter space further confirm that in the cmssm both @xmath76 and @xmath77 lie in the range @xmath78 .    even in the most minimal implementation of the seesaw , assuming that all flavour mixing in @xmath27 is only stemming from the @xmath79 mixing matrix ( i.e. taking the conservative limit @xmath80 in eq .",
    "[ eq : seesaw : casas ] ) , the left - handed slepton mass splittings are much larger than in the cmssm , with values as large as @xmath81 .",
    "very large splittings are associated with heavy seesaw scales ( in particular , @xmath82 ) and/or large , negative values of @xmath64 . aside from the perturbativity bounds on @xmath27 , the most important constraints on the seesaw parameters arise from the non - observation of lfv processes : since both flavour violating brs and slepton mass splittings originate from the same unique source ( @xmath27 ) , compatibility with current bounds , in particular on br(@xmath83 ) and br(@xmath84 ) , may preclude sizable values for the slepton mass splittings .",
    "this unique synergy is instrumental in devising a strategy to test the susy seesaw via the interplay of high- and low - energy observables .",
    "l +    if the lhc measures a given mass splitting , predictions can be made regarding the associated lfv brs ( for an already reconstructed set of msugra parameters ) .",
    "comparison with current bounds ( or possibly an already existing br measurement ) may allow to derive some hints on the underlying source of flavour violation : a measurement of a slepton mass splitting of a few percent , together with a measurement of a low - energy observable ( in agreement to what could be expected from the already reconstructed susy spectrum ) would constitute two signals of lfv that could be simultaneously explained through one common origin - a type - i seesaw mechanism .",
    "on the other hand , two conflicting situations may occur : ( i ) a measurement of a mass splitting associated to lfv decays experimentally excluded ; ( ii ) observation of lfv low - energy signal , and ( for an already reconstructed susy spectrum ) approximate slepton mass universality .",
    "these scenarios would either suggest that non - universal slepton masses or low - energy lfv would be due to a mechanism other than such a simple realisation of a type - i seesaw ( barring accidental cancellations or different neutrino mass schemes ) .",
    "for instance , a simple explanation for the first scenario would be that the mechanism for susy breaking is slightly non - universal ( albeit flavour conserving ) .    to illustrate this interplay , we conduct a general scan over the seesaw parameter space . in fig .",
    "[ fig : brcr.ms : rcomplex : m3:theta13 ] we display different low - energy lfv observables as a function of the @xmath85 mass difference , and choose for this overview of the susy seesaw the lhc points hm1 and su1 .",
    "l +    as can be seen from the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : brcr.ms : rcomplex : m3:theta13 ] , if a susy type - i seesaw is indeed at work , and @xmath86 has been constrained to be extremely small , a measurement of @xmath87 between @xmath88 and 1% , in association with a reconstructed sparticle spectrum similar to hm1 , would be accompanied ( with a significant probability ) by the observation of br(@xmath40 ) at meg  @xcite ( and we notice here that , even for very large values of @xmath82 , the constraints on the parameter space from br(@xmath40 ) would preclude the observation of a @xmath89 transition for an hm1-like spectrum ) .",
    "although lhc production prospects have to be taken into account , when compared to hm1 , su1 offers a less promising framework for the observation of sizable mass splittings at the lhc ( unless a precision of around @xmath90 for @xmath91 can indeed be achieved ) .",
    "however the most interesting lepton flavour signature of su1 is related to its potential to induce large br(@xmath92 ) , within the future sensitivity of superb  @xcite : a measurement of @xmath93 @xmath94 at the lhc would imply br(@xmath92)@xmath95 , and would hint towards a heavy seesaw scale , @xmath96 gev .      in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : edges : seesaw : cmssm ] , we display the br(@xmath97 ) as a function of the di - muon invariant mass @xmath98 for different susy seesaw points ( see  @xcite ) , comparing the distributions with those of the cmssm . as is manifest from fig .",
    "[ fig : edges : seesaw : cmssm ] , the impact of the seesaw at the level of the di - muon mass distributions is quite spectacular , particularly in the appearance of a third edge in most of the benchmark points considered . with the exception of the seesaw variation of point p1 , all other distributions now exhibit the edge corresponding to the presence of an intermediate @xmath99 , implying that the decay occurs via @xmath100 .",
    "for instance , for point p2@xmath101 , the br(@xmath102 ) via intermediate @xmath51 , @xmath43 and @xmath103 are 2.6% , 1.1% and 1.6% , respectively .",
    "interestingly , the fact that the susy seesaw leads to increased mass splittings only for the left - handed sleptons might provide another potential fingerprint for this mechanism of lfv . compiling all the data collected throughout our numerical analysis , we have found that the maximal splitting between right - handed smuons and selectrons is @xmath104 ( while within the susy seesaw @xmath105 could easily reach values of a few % ) .",
    "should the lhc measure mass splittings between right - handed sleptons of the first two families that are significantly above the 0.1% level , this could provide important indication that another mechanism of fv should be at work : among the many possibilities , a likely hypothesis would be the non - universality of the slepton soft - breaking terms .    finally , we display in the lower panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : edges : seesaw : cmssm ] the prospects for direct flavour violation in @xmath45 decays : in addition to the possibility of having staus in the intermediate states , one can also have opposite - sign , different flavour final state di - leptons .",
    "in particular , one can have @xmath106 , with a non - negligible associated branching ratio . for @xmath107 tev and @xmath108 ,",
    "the expected number of events ( without background analysis nor detector simulation ) is @xmath109 .",
    "we have discussed that if the seesaw is indeed the source of both neutrino masses and leptonic mixings , and also accounts for low - energy lfv observables within future sensitivity reach , interesting slepton phenomena are expected to be observed at the lhc : in addition to the mass splittings , the most striking effect will be the possible appearance of new edges in di - lepton mass distributions . from the comparison of the predictions for the two sets of observables ( high and low energy ) with the current experimental bounds and future sensitivities",
