    "in nuclear physics , the mean - field theory has played a central role in understanding the nuclear ground state properties as well as the dynamical nuclear excitations not only with small amplitude but larger one .",
    "amomg the microscopic methods in the nuclear mean - field theory , the time - dependent hartree - fock ( tdhf ) is characterized by the full self - consistency between the mean - field ( collective ) motion and the internal nucleonic motion  @xcite .    the first practical numerical calculation of the tdhf was carried out more than thirty years ago  @xcite . since that time , the tdhf has been applied to the heavy - ion reaction processes such as fusion , deep - inelastic collision , fission and so on with the purpose of understanding the microscopic mechanism of the large amplitude nuclear collective motions in the collision processes  @xcite . in the tdhf calculations ,",
    "the three - dimensional ( 3d ) cartesian grid has been used , combined mainly with the skyrme effective interactions .",
    "recent tdhf calculations of the reactions of the heavier nuclei are carried out by taking advantage of the rapid increase of the computer power  @xcite .",
    "the tdhf has been widely used also in the small amplitude domain of the collective motions such as giant resonances ( gr ) .",
    "it is well known that the tdhf is connected with the random phase approximation ( rpa ) in the small amplitude limit , which is a useful tool to study the collective excitations of the nucleus .",
    "combined with the linear response theory , the excitation energies of the collective motions are obtained by calculating the small amplitude responses of the nucleus to the impulse type perturbation as an initial condition of the tdhf equations  @xcite . a new method to calculate the rpa energies and amplitudes was proposed and applied to several nuclei  @xcite .",
    "the quasiparticle rpa ( qrpa ) is an extention of the rpa to include the pairing correlation effects . in this decade , with the purpose of studying the excitation mechanism of the unstable neutron rich nuclei , the qrpa calculations have been carried out based upon the various formulations @xcite .",
    "just as in the case of the rpa as a small amplitude limit of the tdhf , the qrpa is the small amplitude limit of the time - dependent hartree - fock bogoliubov ( tdhfb ) .",
    "the tdhfb is an extension of the tdhf , in which the pairing correlation in the nucleus is treated selfconsistently with the particle - hole ( ph ) correlations which are taken into account in the tdhf .",
    "a possibility of the practical numerical calculations of the tdhfb with an effective nuclear force ( gogny force ) was presented in ref .",
    "the type of full tdhfb calculation was carried out in the study of the pairing vibrations with skyrme interaction  @xcite .",
    "recently , a framework of the tdhfb calculation in the canonical form with the skyrme interaction ( cb - tdhfb ) was proposed and applied to the linear responses of both light and heavy nuclei  @xcite . the cpu time is substantially reduced even in the calculations of the heavier nuclei by using the cb - tdhfb , which is a useful method in studying the systematic property of the nulei in the wide range of the nuclear chart .    in the hfb calculations with the skyrme interactions ( skyrme - hfb ) ,",
    "the skyrme interaction is used for the ph channel , while another type of interaction is introduced for the particle - particle ( pp ) channel .",
    "since the zero - range interaction is assumed in the skyrme hfb , it is necessary to set the appropriate cut - off energy and choose the optimum parameter set in the pairing part @xcite .",
    "in contrast with the skyrme hfb , in the hfb calculations with the gogny interaction ( gogny - hfb ) , the ph channel and the pp channel are treated on an equal footing . in the gogny-(td)hfb , a practical cut - off of the energy range of the physical space",
    "is introduced naturally from the terms with the gaussian functions of the gogny interaction .",
    "therefore , the gogny interaction is suitable for the formulation of the self - consistent tdhfb framework combined with a practical numerical method of integrating the tdhfb equations .",
    "we put emphasis on this advantageous point of the gogny interaction and developed a gogny - tdhfb code .    in this article",

    "the conservation property of the energy , particle numbers , and center - of - mass of the method was illustrated .",
    "the method was applied to several typical spherical nuclei as well as axially deformed ones and the strength functions were obtained in the framework of the linear response theory .",
    "it was shown that the tendency of the energies of the low - energy peaks in the present tdhfb calculations was similar to the one of the experimental results , though the energies obtained in the tdhfb calculations tend to be lower than the qrpa and experimental results .",
    "on the other hand , the energies of the typical peaks in the energy region of the giant resonances tend to be larger than the qrpa and experimental results .",
    "we will study carefully how the numerical results depend on the space of basis functions and coulomb force .",
    "the present calculations were carried out under the conditions : i ) the maximum major shell quantum number of the space of the harmonic oscillator basis functions was restricted to be four or five .",
    "ii ) the coulomb force was omitted in both hfb and tdhfb calculations .",
    "these restrictions were introduced to save the cpu time and check the feasibility of the present numerical codes of tdhfb .",
    "it is necessary to use larger space of basis functions and to include the coulomb force so that we can deal with the problems of heavier , unstable nuclei in terms of the present tdhfb method . when the larger space of the basis functions is taken , we need efficient numerical methods to save the cpu time of the iterations in the full gogny - tdhfb calculations with the coulomb force",
    ". the acceleration of the calculations of the coulomb part might be realized by introducing a set of small number of _ optimal _ integration points and weights in the calculations of the coulomb mean - field matrix elements .",
    "the new numerical codes by which we could save the cpu time are now being developed .",
