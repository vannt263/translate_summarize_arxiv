    "neutron - rich isotopes with n@xmath460 and a@xmath5100 are characterized by strong axial deformation .",
    "strontium isotopes are the most deformed nuclei known so far in this region .",
    "quadrupole deformations of @xmath2@xmath50.4 have been deduced for @xmath6sr , @xmath3sr and @xmath0sr from the lifetimes of the first excited states and from mean - square radii measured by collinear laser spectroscopy @xcite . according to these results ,",
    "ground - state deformation remains constant after its sudden onset at n = 60 .",
    "this trend might even continue at larger neutron number since neither the @xmath7sr level spacings @xcite nor the 2@xmath8-state energy of 126 kev in the n = 64 isotone @xmath9sr @xcite indicate any large change of deformation .",
    "this dramatic picture has , however , been very recently contested on the basis of high - spin data obtained in prompt fission by the eurogam collaboration suggesting instead a more gradual increase of deformation with neutron number @xcite .",
    "a peculiar feature of neutron - rich sr nuclei is the occurence of identical bands in isotopes with @xmath10a= 2 .",
    "transitions in the ground - state bands in the even - even @xmath11sr and in the k@xmath12=3/2@xmath8 bands in the odd - neutron @xmath13sr have very close energies .",
    "a local trend of strong dependence of moments of inertia on deformation and the fact that all involved sr isotopes have the same deformation seem to be the origin of these identical bands @xcite .",
    "however , the intricate mechanism is not yet understood .",
    "presently , the nucleus @xmath0sr@xmath14 is the most neutron - rich even - even sr isotope for which experiments can yield some structure information .",
    "the levels in @xmath0sr were first observed at the cern - isolde facility in a @xmath2-decay study of @xmath0rb by azuma et al . who identified the 4@xmath15 2@xmath15 0@xmath8 cascade and performed the first lifetime measurement of the 2@xmath16 state @xcite , establishing large deformation . a more accurate lifetime measurement performed later by our group , lead to the deformation of @xmath2=0.40 @xcite . in the same experiment ,",
    "a 85  ns lifetime was observed for the 1619 kev level and attributed to k - hindrance of the decay to the 4@xmath16 state by the 1202 kev transition @xcite .",
    "recently , further members of the ground - state band up to i@xmath17 were identified in prompt - fission studies @xcite .",
    "the large moment of inertia shows very little variation with angular momentum .",
    "thus , @xmath0sr is a strongly deformed nucleus with properties close to the rotational limit .",
    "yet , data on non - yrast levels in @xmath0sr remained scarce . here",
    "we present a more comprehensive decay scheme of @xmath0rb to @xmath0sr , including new non - yrast levels and band structure built on the k - isomer .",
    "in addition , @xmath2-delayed neutron emission from @xmath0rb @xcite provides a new access to levels in @xmath3sr , complementing data from @xmath3rb @xmath2-decay @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0rb activity was produced by fission of natural uranium induced by 600 mev protons , followed by on - line mass separation at the isolde facility .",
    "the main goal of the experiment was to determine the deformation of the @xmath2-decay daughter nucleus @xmath0sr from the lifetime of its 2@xmath16 state at 129 kev , as presented in ref .",
    "we now report on the result of a detailed analysis of @xmath18singles and @xmath19 coincidence measurements recorded with the planar ge - detector used for the lifetime measurement ( 4.9  @xmath20 area by 1.3  cm depth ) and a coaxial ge - detector of 27@xmath21 relative efficiency .",
    "the highest energy to be recorded with the planar detector was set to about 1250 kev , in order to allow gating of the 1202 kev line .",
    "the coaxial detector covered energies up to 4.2 mev , which still is lower than the neutron separation energy s@xmath22 of 6.12 mev for @xmath0sr @xcite .",
    "the low efficiency for coincidences where both transition energies are above say 1 mev prevents the construction of a complete decay scheme .",
    "nevertheless , the setup allows detection of the @xmath1-rays important for the discussion of the low - lying levels of @xmath3sr and @xmath0sr .",
    "since @xmath0rb is situated very far from @xmath2-stability , @xmath1-spectra are very complex due to the long chain of a = 100 isobaric activities produced by filiation and some other a = 99 activities following @xmath2-delayed neutron emission from @xmath0rb .    in a first step , the identification of transitions to @xmath0rb decay was made by requiring a coincidence with either the 129.2 kev ( @xmath23 ) transition in @xmath0sr or with the 90.8 kev ( @xmath24 ) transition in @xmath3sr , detected in the planar detector .",
    "these projections are shown in fig .",
    "[ figspec100 ] and fig .",
    "[ figspec99 ] .",
    "gates were set on all the coincident transitions in the coaxial ge - detector , and the new projections on the planar detector were analysed .",
    "prompt coincidences with a window of about 60  ns and delayed coincidences were analysed to help placing transitions with respect to the 85  ns isomer in @xmath0sr .",
    "many ground - state transitions have been placed on the sole basis of their good energy fit between levels established by coincidence relationships .",
    "the weakest of them must be regarded as tentative since there is a chance that such transitions also belong to other activities and could have been overlooked in previous studies .",
    "fortunately , decay schemes of @xmath0sr and of its descendants are well known @xcite , and several decays in the a = 99 mass chain were also re - investigated recently @xcite .    owing to its superior energy resolution",
    ", the planar detector is very effective for the identification of low - energy transitions depopulating the k - isomer in @xmath0sr and of the band structures in @xmath3sr .",
    "however , its efficiency decreases rapidly with increasing energy .",
    "this made the placement of the weakest high - energy transitions uncertain , since these may be seen in coincidence with the 129 kev @xmath23 transition in @xmath0sr or the 91 or 125 kev transitions in @xmath3sr , but no longer with occasional intermediate higher - energy transitions .",
    "consequently , the high - energy part of the level schemes remains tentative .",
    "thus , logft values for low - lying levels might be strongly underestimated in these cases where feeding high - energy @xmath1-rays have been overlooked .",
    "it has finally to be noted that the surface - ionisation ion - source used in our experiment produced rubidium and strontium beams with high efficiency . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the presence of an intense @xmath0sr beam prevents the use of intensity balance considerations to determine the ground - state @xmath2-branching from @xmath0rb to @xmath0sr . as a consequence of the unknown amount of produced @xmath0rb ,",
    "the @xmath2-delayed neutron emission probability p@xmath22 can not be deduced from @xmath1-ray intensities .",
    "the levels known prior to this analysis were members of the ground - state band @xcite and the 85  ns isomer at 1619 kev @xcite . based on nuclear structure arguments",
    ", it was assumed that both the @xmath0rb ground state and the isomer in @xmath0sr are i@xmath25=4@xmath26 states . in this particular case ,",
    "the delayed @xmath1-@xmath1 coincidences across the isomer allow a high sensitivity for detecting feeding transitions .",
    "the strong @xmath2-decay branch to the isomer is accordingly the most reliable one deduced in this work .",
    "a logft of 5.6 is obtained if intensity balances are calculated including the tentatively placed transitions ( it becomes somewhat lower by removing them ) .",
    "this value is in agreement with the allowed character for this 4@xmath27 to 4@xmath27 transition .",
    "transitions in the decay of @xmath0rb to @xmath0sr are listed in table [ tabgam100 ] .",
    "the decay scheme is shown in fig .",
    "[ figsch100 ] . in the following ,",
    "we present the arguments for placing the most important levels .",
    "the 937.8 kev level is based on the coincidence of the 809 kev line with the 129 kev 2@xmath15 0@xmath8 transition .",
    "the intensity of this coincidence is high enough to ensure that further coincidences with the 288 kev line and with the most intense lines in the 1 mev region have not been overlooked .",
    "no line of energy suitable as a ground - state transition is found in the singles spectra .",
    "the coincidence of a line in the 129 kev gate and a ground - state transition establish the next levels at 1257.1 kev and 1315.4 kev with spin and parity of i@xmath12=2@xmath16 .",
    "it must be mentioned here that both logft values , 5.6 and 5.8 respectively , are clearly too low for the assumed first - forbidden unique transitions .",
    "alternatives to solve the discrepancies will be discussed in a later section .",
    "the levels at 1414.6 , 1500.6 and 1560.6 kev are supported by low - energy feeding transitions from the 1619 kev ( i@xmath25=4@xmath26 ) level and de - excitation to both the 129 ( i@xmath25=2@xmath16 ) and 417 kev ( i@xmath25=4@xmath16 ) levels .",
    "no transitions to the ground state are found .",
    "transition rates for the 58.3 , 118.0 and 204.4 kev transitions from the 85  ns isomer are consistent with strongly retarded dipole transitions or moderately delayed e2 transitions .",
    "thus , i=3 of either parity or 4@xmath16 are possible for these levels .    the isomeric level at 1619 kev ( t@xmath28=85 ns ) has been proposed as i@xmath25=4@xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the strongly hindered 1202 kev e1 transition to the 417 kev 4@xmath16 state has to compete with transitions of very much lower energies to the levels at 1415 , 1501 and 1561 kev .",
    "delayed coincidences indicate that the 161.8 , 194.4 and 864.0 kev transitions are above the isomeric level .",
    "the prompt 162 - 702 kev weak coincidence could indicate a 702.3 kev transition above the 1781 kev level , but may also be due to the cross - talk of the strong 864 kev transition belonging to the decay of @xmath0y @xcite .",
    "a complex structure is associated with the prompt 162 - 194 kev coincidence .",
    "a contribution is due to lines placed in @xmath3sr .",
    "another one , so far not reported , belongs to @xmath3zr . due to these interferences",
    "a 161.8 - 194.4 kev coincidence in @xmath0sr remains tentative .",
    "we nevertheless assume the 194 and 162 kev transitions to be coincident and to form a band structure on top of the 1619 kev i@xmath12=4@xmath27 isomer for two reasons .",
    "first , the energies are in perfect agreement with the rotational formula for a 6@xmath29 5@xmath29 4 spin sequence .",
    "second , @xmath2-feedings to the 1781 and 1619 kev levels are in a ratio of 0.19(4 ) to 0.81(4 ) .",
    "this is calculated neglecting conversion of the weak lines from the 1619 kev level and the possible feeding to the 1781 kev level by the 702 kev weak transition , but these corrections remain within the quoted error .",
    "the @xmath2-feeding intensities are thus in excellent agreement with the theoretical values of 0.20 ( i=5 ) and 0.80 ( i=4 ) according to the alaga rule @xcite .",
    "the deduced @xmath2-decay branchings are inconsistent with the 2@xmath8 spin and parity of the first excited state ( logft=5.8 ) and of the new levels at 1257 kev ( 5.6 ) and 1315 kev ( 5.8 ) .",
    "these inconsistencies could be removed by lowering the ground - state spin of @xmath0rb to i=3 , but contradicting the arguments for i@xmath12=4@xmath27 in ref .",
    "@xcite and the strong population of the 11/2@xmath8 state of the @xmath3sr ground - state band ( see next section ) . as stated above",
    ", they could be a consequence of the partial nature of the decay scheme .",
    "alternatively , a yet not identified low - spin isomer in @xmath0rb could be invoked .",
    "this issue remains presently unsolved .",
    "level properties are listed in table [ tablev100 ] , where @xmath2-feedings have been calculated under the assumption of a single @xmath2-decaying parent nucleus .",
    "+      transitions in the decay of @xmath0rb to @xmath3sr via @xmath2-delayed neutron emisssion are listed in table  [ tabgam99 ] .",
    "the decay scheme is shown in fig .",
    "[ figsch99 ] .",
    "there is only a partial overlap between the levels observed in @xmath2-decay of @xmath3rb @xcite and in this work .",
    "the highest members of the k = 3/2 ground - state band of @xmath3sr are more strongly populated in @xmath2-delayed neutron decay of @xmath0rb than in @xmath2-decay of @xmath3rb .",
    "the new 570 kev level has transitions only to the 7/2@xmath16 and 9/2@xmath16 levels of the ground - state band ( g.s.b . ) at 216 and 378 kev .",
    "the excellent energy fitting and the consistency of the @xmath30(g@xmath31-g@xmath32)/q@xmath33@xmath30 parameter extracted from the branching ratios suggest the 570 kev level to be the 11/2@xmath16 member of the g.s.b . , ( see table  [ tabgsb1 ] and table  [ tabgsb2 ] ) .    the levels at 423 , 535 and 684 kev have been assigned 5/2@xmath16 , 7/2@xmath16 and 9/2@xmath16 , respectively in @xcite .",
    "the energy of the 304.4 kev transition was unluckily stated as 307 kev .",
    "the energy of the last level is thus 682.1 kev .",
    "the highest - spin level of this band is weakly populated and there is no evidence for a 11/2 level .",
    "odd parity logically accounts for the non detection of a @xmath1-branch from the 682 kev i=9/2 level to the 5/2@xmath16 state at 91 kev , in spite of the high efficiency for the expected coincidence , since the missing transition had to be a m2 .",
    "the difference of populations of the g.s.b . and",
    "the excited band enable some insight in the decay mechanism .",
    "for the levels in the g.s.b . the parity change requires a p - wave neutron if @xmath2-decay has allowed character or a s - wave and first - forbidden decay .",
    "there are several ways to reach the new 11/2@xmath8 level at 570 kev and this is consistent with the experimental strong population . in contrast",
    ", the k=5/2 excited band could mainly be reached via allowed @xmath2-decay with the emission of s - wave neutrons , leading to a smaller range of populated spins and fewer ways to reach the final levels .    comparing the intensity of the 91 - 125 kev coincidences in @xmath3sr with those of various coincidence pairs in the level schemes of @xmath3y and @xmath3zr ,",
    "one obtains a branching of 0.13(3 ) for the 125 kev line per @xmath2-delayed neutron decay of @xmath0rb .",
    "consequently , about 50% of the feeding bypasses the excited levels of @xmath3sr and directly feeds its 3/2@xmath8 ground state .",
    "this looks to be a rather high value . it could be a consequence of @xmath2-decay of @xmath3rb due to some , even modest , mass contamination or , alternatively , by additional population from an hypothetical low - spin isomer in @xmath0rb .",
    "the systematics of deformed neutron - rich sr isotopes is limited to @xmath6sr , @xmath0sr and @xmath9sr ( see fig .  [ figsystsr ] ) .",
    "this is due to the sudden onset of deformation resulting from the energy shifts of coexisting shapes @xcite .",
    "thus , the deformed 1465 kev level in @xmath34sr@xmath35 corresponds to the @xmath6sr@xmath36 ground state while the @xmath34sr spherical ground state is associated with the excited 0@xmath8 state at 215 kev in @xmath6sr .",
    "we note that the lowest deformed state reported so far in the odd - neutron nucleus @xmath37sr is a k@xmath12=3/2@xmath8 band head at 585 kev @xcite .",
    "the rate of lowering of the deformed minimum with n is almost constant . extrapolating to @xmath0sr",
    ", a spherical 0@xmath16 state is expected near 1.7 mev .",
    "several levels above 0.9 mev with only a decay to the 2@xmath16 state could be 0@xmath16 states .",
    "however , no spin and parity assignments are possible for them . in contrast , the systematics of n = 62 isotones spans a larger number of nuclides and is much smoother , ( see fig .",
    "[ figsyst62 ] ) .",
    "several low - spin collective levels can be followed from the spherical plus @xmath1-soft @xmath38pd @xcite to the strongly deformed @xmath9zr @xcite , owing to the gradual evolution of their energies and decay branchings .",
    "extrapolation to @xmath0sr predicts a rather low - lying 0@xmath8 state for which the 938 kev level is a good candidate and , at somewhat higher energy , of two 2@xmath8 states which could be the 1257 and 1315 kev experimental 2@xmath8 levels . these levels could be regarded as non - yrast collective deformed levels , i.e. as the head of the @xmath2-band , its 2@xmath8 and the 2@xmath8 @xmath1-band head , the order of the latter two being rather arbitrarily chosen in fig .",
    "[ figsyst62 ] .",
    "however , another interpretation was put to our attention by k.  heyde @xcite . some of these states ( the 0@xmath16 and a 2@xmath16 ) could be spherical , corresponding to the complex structures in @xmath34sr and other n=58 isotones associated with vibrational normal states or two - particle - two - hole excitations across the z = 40 spherical subshell @xcite . in this interpretation",
    ", they would be lying much lower than expected .",
    "this could happen if , as approaching neutron midshell , the deformed states nearly reach their minimum energy relative to the spherical ones and the change of relative energies becomes smaller",
    ". it might even be possible to consider a minimum of deformation energy before n=66 .",
    "an indication could be the lowest excitation energies of intruder states in the rh and pd isotopes @xcite which occur at n = 64 .",
    "the difficulties to establish the nature of low - lying 0@xmath8 states are made apparent by the numerous studies devoted to @xmath39sm , a nucleus close to stability where detailed experiments are possible . in that region",
    ", a rapid shape transition also occurs and while the @xmath39sm ground - state band exhibits rotational structure , other interpretations have been proposed for the excited 0@xmath8 band , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite and therein . in order to clarify the nature of the new 938 , 1257 and 1315 kev levels in @xmath0sr , it would be of great importance to search for band structure and to measure transition rates . according to systematics showing that the largest @xmath40(e0 ) values have been measured in this region @xcite , an especially large value for the decay of the tentatively 0@xmath8 level at 938 kev would be a signature of shape coexistence .",
    "the 1619 kev isomeric level has been interpreted as a i@xmath12=4@xmath26 state , based on considerations of hindrances of its decay to the 4@xmath16 level of the ground - state band @xcite .",
    "the proposed [ 411]3/2@xmath41[532]5/2 neutron configuration involves the lowest quasiparticles for n = 61 and n = 63 in this region @xcite .",
    "a band built on a similar level has been identified in @xmath9zr by durell et al . using prompt fission @xcite .",
    "they observed the band up to the i@xmath12=9@xmath27 level , but did not report a lifetime for the band head at 1821 kev .",
    "the postulated 2-quasiparticle configuration has been reproduced by quantum monte carlo calculations for @xmath0sr and @xmath9zr performed by capote et al .",
    "the decrease of pairing confirms numerous calculations of decay properties by the qrpa model @xcite .",
    "the gallagher rule @xcite favours coupling of antiparallel intrinsic spins .",
    "thus , a 1@xmath26 spin - singlet level is expected below the 4@xmath26 spin - triplet state .",
    "such a level has not been identified in this work nor in @xmath2-decay or prompt fission studies of @xmath9zr @xcite .",
    "it has to be mentioned that if the ground - state transition is the only strong decay mode , such a low - spin level can easily have escaped observation in experiments strongly relying on coincidence data .      the new level at 570 kev is the 11/2@xmath16 member of the previously established k = 3/2 ground - state band @xcite .",
    "the band analysis shown in table  [ tabgsb2 ] yields the absolute value of the e2/m1 mixing ratio for the @xmath42 transition , @xmath43(91  kev)@xmath30= 0.171(13 ) . from the lifetime of the 91 kev level ,",

    "this energy compression is systematically observed in this region for odd - parity bands , where it has been attributed to coriolis mixing @xcite .",
    "the [ 532]5/2 orbital is clearly favoured as being the only one of odd parity near the fermi surface .",
    "the systematics of odd - neutron quasiparticle levels for n = 61 has to be partly revised since the 5/2@xmath27 energy in @xmath3sr turns out to be higher than expected from a simple extrapolation versus deformation @xcite .",

    "large moments of inertia and rigid rotations are exhibited by a number of odd or odd - odd nuclei in the a@xmath5100 region of neutron - rich nuclei but @xmath6sr and @xmath0sr are the only even - even nuclei showing such pronounced features @xcite .",

    "however , this simple explanation faces the problem that no k= 1/2 bands have been observed so far in the odd neighbours and there is no k= 1/2 orbital close to the fermi surface .",
    "the 11/2@xmath16 to 7/2@xmath16 energy difference of 353.9 kev in the g.s.b . of @xmath3sr is also fairly close to the 6@xmath27 to 4@xmath27 energy difference of 356.2 kev in the k@xmath12= 4@xmath26 band in @xmath0sr .",
    "this can be written as j@xmath56 = j@xmath57 . in both cases ,",
    "the increase in transition energy due to the extra half - a - unit of spin ( via the i(i+1 ) term ) is counteracted by the increase of the moment of inertia due to the additional unpaired neutron .",
    "these effects turn out to compensate almost perfectly , thus keeping the transition energies equal . a priori",
    ", there is no reason why this happens to be so .",
    "the increment of half - a - spin unit perhaps could indicate a treatment in the pseudospin framework as appropriate @xcite .",
    "we also note that this simple rule includes the formerly reported identical bands with @xmath10a= 2 , in which case there are no unpaired particles or one in both partners and the spins of the levels are the same .",
    "we note a further trend towards identical energies in sr and zr isotopes by breaking a neutron pair .",
    "the deformation of @xmath9zr is large ( @xmath2=0.38 @xcite ) but , its moment of inertia still is significantly smaller than the one of @xmath0sr ( e@xmath58(@xmath9zr)= 151.9 kev ) .",
    "nevertheless , the energies for the transitions in the two - quasineutron k@xmath12=4@xmath26 bands , 161.8 and 194.4 kev for @xmath0sr and 159.3 and 194.4 kev for @xmath9zr @xcite are also similar , see fig .",
    "[ figident ] . breaking a neutron pair to form the 4@xmath26 isomer",
    "does not increase the already large moment of inertia of @xmath0sr as much as the one of @xmath9zr .",
    "finally , the k@xmath12=5/2@xmath26 bands of odd - neutron nuclei tend to become identical at the largest deformations , as a further increase is expected at larger n for zr isotopes . in particular , the 7/2@xmath59 5/2@xmath27 energies of zr isotopes come closer to the energies in sr , see table  [ tabk5half ] .      according to the table of isotopes @xcite ,",
    "the ground state of @xmath3rb is 5/2@xmath16 .",
    "this assignment is requested to account for sizeable @xmath2-feeding to the 7/2@xmath16 state of the g.s.b . of @xmath3sr",
    ". however , the @xmath2-decay branching to the 5/2@xmath16 state is non existent .",
    "this pattern in contradiction with the alaga rule ( the 5/2 level is calculated to be 6 times more populated than the 7/2 state ) casts some doubts about the reliability of intensity balances .",
    "in fact , systematics suggests 3/2@xmath8 . for @xmath37rb",
    "i= 3/2 was measured by laser spectroscopy @xcite and the decay of @xmath7rb also suggested i(@xmath7rb)=3/2 @xcite .",
    "the nilsson scheme indeed predicts the [ 431]3/2 proton orbital to be the last one occupied for z = 37 .    according to ref .",
    "@xcite the 4@xmath26 ground state of @xmath0rb originates from the coupling of this [ 431]3/2 proton with the [ 532]5/2 neutron which is shown experimentally to be the ground state of n= 63 isotones @xcite .",
    "the gallagher - moszkowski rule @xcite depresses the 4@xmath26 level with respect to its 1@xmath26 partner to create the 4@xmath26 ground state . from purely experimental considerations it is not possible to determine the spin of @xmath0rb",
    "nevertheless , odd parity is in agreement with the large @xmath2-feeding to the isomeric 4@xmath26 level in @xmath0sr .",
    "in addition , the existence of a low - spin isomer in @xmath0rb has been conjectured as a source of feeding to low - spin levels in @xmath0sr in addition to consequences of the low efficiency for detecting high - energy coincidence pairs .",
    "another observation , less sensitive on the details of the level scheme , gives further support to this assumption .",
    "the p@xmath22-value can not be calculated since the ground - state branch to @xmath0sr can not be measured .",
    "nevertheless , i@xmath12= 4@xmath27 for @xmath0rb does not allow sizeable g.s . feeding . in this case , a p@xmath22-value of 26(8)% is calculated by comparing the intensities of @xmath1-rays in @xmath0sr and in a = 99 activities .",
    "this is a subtantially higher value than obtained from direct neutron measurement yielding only about 6% @xcite . allowing non - zero ground - state feeding to @xmath0sr ,",
    "the calculated p@xmath22-value is lowered . this way , these values could come in better agreement .    the 1@xmath27 level from the @xmath60[431]3/2@xmath61[532]5/2 coupling mentioned above could indeed be associated with this hypothetical isomer .",
    "first - forbidden decay could populate 2@xmath8 states and also the tentative 0@xmath8 state at 938 kev",
    ". then , logft - values to 2@xmath8 states would be only slightly too low , which is acceptable considering the uncertainties in @xmath1-ray feedings by high - energy transitions .",
    "this is only one of the possible alternatives to generate low - spin and low - lying levels since there are several experimentally known low - lying neutron levels at n = 63 . ultimately , the existence of an isomer depends on the presence at low energy of i = ( 2,3 ) levels . the lowest lying level",
    "after the 4@xmath27 ground state is probably the 3@xmath8 state built on @xmath60[431]3/2@xmath61[411]3/2 since the [ 411]3/2 level is only a few hundreds of kev above the ground state , e.g. 271 kev in @xmath7sr @xcite and 259 kev in @xmath62zr @xcite .",
    "the existence of a low - spin isomer thus critically depends on the amplitude of the gallagher - moszkowski splittings .",
    "we have studied the decay of the very neutron - rich nucleus @xmath0rb to its @xmath2-daughter @xmath0sr and @xmath2-n daughter @xmath3sr . the level scheme of @xmath0sr , a strongly deformed nucleus with very good rotational properties , has been considerably extended . among the lowest - lying levels",
    "we have introduced two 2@xmath8 states at 1257 and 1315 kev and a tentative 0@xmath8 state at 938 kev , all smoothly extending the energy systematics of n = 62 isotones . yet",
    "their nature , members of @xmath2 and @xmath1 bands or spherical intruder states , is unknown and has to be investigated further .",
    "the identification of the 5@xmath26 and 6@xmath26 levels of the band built on the 85  ns k@xmath12= 4@xmath27 isomer is suggested by transition energies and @xmath2-feeding intensities .",
    "it creates an appealing analogy with @xmath9zr where a similar band is known from prompt fission .",
    "the large moment of inertia of the g.s .",
    "band and the low energy ( 1619 kev ) of the 4@xmath27 isomer indicate a strong reduction of pairing with respect to the standard estimate .",
    "these features are more pronounced for @xmath0sr than for its isotone @xmath9zr .",
    "however , the transition energies of the 4@xmath26 two - quasineutron bands are nearly identical .",
    "beta - delayed neutron decay has allowed an extension of the [ 411]3/2 ground - state band in @xmath3sr by adding the 11/2@xmath16 level assigned from energy fitting and branching ratios . based on weaker arguments of @xmath2-n feedings and @xmath1-ray branchings , the [ 532]5/2",
    "orbital has been assigned to the 423 kev level , head of a band whose 7/2 and 9/2 levels are also observed .",
    "the new transitions in @xmath3sr and @xmath0sr define a new group of transitions with very similar energies .",
    "all identical transitions in strontium isotopes appear to follow a simple rule given as j@xmath63 = j@xmath64 where @xmath65 is the number of unpaired neutrons and @xmath66 the spin of the initial level .",
    "this extends the systematics of previously reported identical transitions in @xmath10a= 2 nuclei which are a particular case with the same number of unpaired neutrons .",
    "moreover , with increasing neutron number ( i.e. presumably of deformation ) , energies of the 5/2@xmath27 band members in odd - zr isotopes tend to become close to those in sr isotopes .",
    "these peculiarities are surely worth to be further investigated .",
