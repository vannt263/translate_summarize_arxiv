    "erasure channels , the first example of which was introduced in @xcite , have attracted an increasing attention in the last decades . originally regarded as purely theoretical channels , they turned out to be a very good abstraction model for the transmission of data over the internet , where packets get lost randomly due to",
    ", for example , buffer overflows at intermediate routers .",
    "erasure channels also find applications in wireless and satellite channels where deep fading events can cause the loss of one or multiple packets .",
    "traditionally , mechanisms have been used in order to achieve reliable communication .",
    "a good example is the that is used for data transmission over the internet .",
    "relies on feedback from the receiver and retransmissions and it is known to perform poorly when the delay between transmitter and receiver is high or when multiple receivers are present ( reliable multicasting ) .",
    "an early work on erasure coding is @xcite , where reed - solomon codes and ( dense ) linear random codes are proposed .",
    "however , those techniques become impractical due to their complexity already for small block lengths .",
    "more recently tornado codes were proposed for transmission over erasure channels @xcite .",
    "tornado codes have linear encoding and decoding complexities ( under decoding ) . however , the encoding and decoding complexities are proportional to their block lengths and not their dimension . hence , they are not suitable for low rate applications such as reliable multicasting in which the transmitter needs to adapt its code rate to the user with the worst channel ( highest erasure probability ) .",
    "codes have also been proposed for use over erasure channels @xcite and they have been proved to be practical in several scenarios even under decoding .",
    "fountain codes @xcite are erasure codes potentially able to generate an endless amount of encoded symbols .",
    "they find application in contexts where the channel erasure rate is not known a priori . the first class of practical fountain codes , codes ,",
    "was introduced in @xcite together with an iterative decoding algorithm that is efficient when the number of input symbols @xmath0 is large .",
    "one of the shortcomings of codes is that in order to have a low probability of unsuccessful decoding , the encoding cost per output symbol has to be @xmath1 .",
    "raptor codes were introduced in @xcite @xcite as an evolution of codes .",
    "they were also independently proposed in @xcite , where they are referred to as online codes .",
    "raptor codes consist of a serial concatenation of an outer code @xmath2 ( usually called precode ) with an inner code .",
    "the code design can thus be relaxed requiring only the recovery of a fraction @xmath3 of the input symbols with @xmath4 small .",
    "this can be achieved with linear encoding complexity .",
    "the outer code is responsible for recovering the remaining fraction of input symbols , @xmath4 . if the outer code @xmath2 is linear - time encodable , then the raptor code has a linear encoding complexity , @xmath5 , and therefore the overall encoding cost per output symbol is constant with respect to @xmath0 .",
    "if decoding is used , the decoding complexity is also linear in the dimension @xmath0 and not in the blocklegth @xmath6 , as it is the case for ldpc and tornado codes .",
    "this leads to a constant decoding cost per symbol , regardless of the blocklength ( i.e. , of the rate ) .",
    "furthermore , in @xcite it was shown that raptor codes under decoding are universally capacity - achieving on the binary erasure channel .",
    "most of the works on and raptor codes consider decoding which has a good performance for very large input blocks ( @xmath0 at least in the order of a few tens of thousands symbols ) . often in practice ,",
    "smaller blocks are used .",
    "for example , for the raptor codes standardized in @xcite and @xcite the recommended values of @xmath0 range from @xmath7 to @xmath8 . for these input block lengths ,",
    "the performance under decoding degrades considerably . in this context",
    ", an efficient decoding algorithm in the form of inactivation decoding @xcite may be used in place of .",
    "some recent works have studied the decoding complexity of raptor and codes under inactivation decoding @xcite . in @xcite",
    "lower bounds on the distance and error exponent are derived for a concatenated scheme with random outer code and a fixed inner code . in @xcite",
    "it is shown how the rank profile of the constraint matrix of a raptor code depends on the rank profile of the outer code parity check matrix and the generator matrix of the lt code . in @xcite",
    "upper and lower bounds on the bit error probability of and raptor codes under decoding are derived .",
    "the outer codes there considered in this work are picked from a linear ensemble in which the elements of the parity check matrix are independently set to one with a given probability @xmath9 .",
    "this work is extended in @xcite , where upper and lower bounds on the codeword error probability of codes under decoding are developed .",
    "another extension of this work is @xcite where a pseudo upper bound on the performance of raptor codes under decoding is derived under the assumption that the number of erasures correctable by the outer code is small .",
    "hence , this approximation holds only if the rate of the outer code is sufficiently high .",
    "in @xcite lower and upper bounds on the probability of successful decoding of codes under decoding as a function of the receiver overhead are derived , while corresponding bounds are developed in @xcite for raptor codes . in @xcite finite length protograph - based raptor - like ldpc codes",
    "are proposed for the awgn channel .    despite their rateless capability ,",
    "raptor codes represent an excellent solution also for fixed - rate communication schemes requiring powerful erasure correction capabilities with low decoding complexity .",
    "it is not surprising that raptor codes are used in a fixed - rate setting by some existing communication systems ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in this context",
    ", the performance under erasure decoding is determined by the distance properties of the fixed - rate raptor code ensemble .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , in this work we consider raptor codes in a fixed - rate setting analyzing their distance properties .",
    "in particular , we focus on the case where the outer code is picked from the linear random code ensemble .",
    "the choice of this ensemble is not arbitrary .",
    "the outer code used by the r10 raptor code , the most widespread version of binary raptor codes ( see @xcite ) , is a concatenation of two systematic codes , the first being a high - rate regular code and the second a pseudo - random code characterized by a dense parity check matrix",
    ". the outer codes of r10 raptor codes were designed to behave as codes drawn from the linear random ensemble in terms of rank properties , but allowing a fast algorithm for matrix - vector multiplication @xcite .",
    "thus , the ensemble we analyze may be seen as a simple model for practical raptor codes with outer codes specifically designed to mimic the behavior of linear random codes .",
    "this model has the advantage to make the analytical investigation tractable .",
    "moreover , although it is simple , the results obtained using this model allow predicting the behavior of binary raptor codes in the standards rather accurately , as illustrated by simulation results in this paper .",
    "for the considered raptor ensemble we develop a necessary and sufficient condition to guarantee a strictly positive normalized typical minimum distance , that involves the degree distribution of the inner fixed - rate code , its rate , and the rate of the outer code .",
    "it identifies a positive normalized typical minimum distance region on the @xmath10 plane , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the inner and outer code rates .",
    "this can be used as an instrument for fixed - rate raptor code desing . in particular , for a given overall rate @xmath13 of the fixed - rate raptor ensemble , it allows to identify the smallest fraction of @xmath13 that has to be assigned to the outer code to obtain good distance properties .",
    "a necessary condition is also derived which , beyond the inner / outer code rates , depends on the average output degree only .",
    "finally we show how the analytical results presented in this paper may be used to predict the performance of finite length fixed - rate raptor codes .",
    "this work extends the earlier conference paper @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : ensemble ]",
    "we introduce the main definitions .",
    "section  [ sec : dist ] provides the derivation of the average weight distribution of the raptor code ensemble considered and the associated growth rate .",
    "section  [ sec : rate_reg ] provides necessary and sufficient conditions for a linear growth of the minimum distance with the block length ( positive normalized typical minimum distance ) .",
    "numerical results are presented in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "the conclusions follow in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we consider fixed - rate raptor code ensembles based on the encoder structure depicted in figure [ fig : raptor ] .",
    "the encoder is given by a serial concatenation of an @xmath14 outer code with an @xmath15 inner fixed - rate code .",
    "we denote by @xmath16 the outer encoder input , and by @xmath17 the corresponding random vector . similarly , @xmath18 and",

    "we consider the ensemble of raptor codes @xmath32 obtained by a serial concatenation of an outer code in the @xmath33 binary linear random block code ensemble @xmath34 , with all possible realizations of an @xmath35 fixed - rate code with output degree distribution @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the probability of having an output symbols of degree @xmath38 .",
