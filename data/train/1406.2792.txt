    "obtained a diffuse neutrino background spectrum from grbs for specific parameter sets in the internal shock model .",
    "alternatively , the neutrino emission might arise in a dissipative jet photosphere @xcite .",

    "@xcite predicted a neutrino precursor of @xmath4 , which is produced by internal shocks at radius @xmath5 .",
    "@xcite presented a new analysis of the neutrino flux of these internal shocks for two types of source environments : the slow - jet supernova ( sjs ) model and the grb model . still further ,",
    "@xcite studied high energy neutrino production in collimated jets inside progenitors of gamma - ray bursts and supernovae , considering both collimation and internal shocks .",

    "the jet propagation dynamics has been studied . assuming a constant jet velocity , @xcite discussed the propagation of a galactic jet in the intergalactic medium .",
    "@xcite analyzed the propagation in the envelope of a red supergiant star , ignoring the surrounding cocoon .",
    "@xcite studied the jet - cocoon structure and jet head velocity that is constrained by ram pressure balance , but they did not consider the collimation by cocoon pressure . @xcite took into account the collimation effect and meanwhile they assumed that the jet expands adiabatically .",
    "@xcite considered a collimated shock that forms at the base of the jet and dissipates parts of the jet s energy to counterbalance the cocoon s pressure .",
    "they figured out the geometry of a collimated shock , and thus further obtained the requirement for jet collimation .",
    "moreover , it is worth mentioning that various numerical simulations of jet propagation in the envelope already have been performed @xcite .    in our paper",
    "we try to calculate the flux of high energy neutrinos from the shocks formed at the jet head for low - luminosity grbs ( ll - grbs ) and ultra - long grbs ( ul - grbs ) , when the jet is still propagating inside the envelope .",
    "most importantly , we take into account the jet collimation which could largely affect the final neutrino flux but was ignored in the previous studies . for simplicity",
    ", we only account for jet propagation in the helium core because collimation mainly happens there .",
    "we assume a power law envelope density profile @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 with @xmath10 and @xmath11 being the mass and radius of the helium envelope .",
    "we employ the analytical solutions described in @xcite to further calculate the neutrino flux in different collimation regimes and at last we discuss its dependence on the index @xmath1 , providing an alternative way to probe the grb progenitor through neutrino precursor signal in the future .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss the jet propagation dynamics . in section 3",
    "we perform detailed calculations of neutrino flux in each regime and a comparison between different regimes .",
    "dependence on @xmath1 is considered in section 4 .",
    "we make a comparison with previous works in section 5 and finally we finish with discussions and conclusions in section 6 .",
    "according to @xcite , the head velocity is constrained by ram pressure balance , @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the density , pressure , velocity , lorentz factor and dimensionless specific enthalpy , and the subscripts @xmath15 and @xmath16 refer to jet and ambient material .",
    "then the jet head velocity is @xmath17 with @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the jet luminosity and @xmath20 is the jet s cross section .",
    "the parameter @xmath21 is crucial for determining collimation regimes ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* table 1 ) . while @xmath22 the jet is strongly collimated by the cocoon pressure , where @xmath23 is the jet opening angle .",
    "@xcite would further divide it into two situations : @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the uncollimated regime corresponds to @xmath26 , accordingly .",
    "the internal energy and particle number density of the shocked and unshocked regions are correlated by @xcite @xmath27 @xmath28 where the subscripts @xmath29 and @xmath30 represent regions that have been crossed by the forward shock and reverse shock .",
    "@xmath31 is the lorentz factor of the head and @xmath32 is the lorentz factor of the unshocked jet measured in the jet head frame , @xmath33 moreover , the density of the unshocked jet materials @xmath34 is determined by @xmath35 based on the above equations , we can carry on our calculation .",
    "in this section , we take @xmath36 as our premise , and discuss the dependence on @xmath1 later in section 4 .",
    "the most promising acceleration process in a grb is fermi acceleration mechanism .",
    "but now there are noteworthy arguments that once the the jet bulk kinetic energy is dissipated at the collimation shock , the collimated jet would become radiation dominated and then the reverse shock occurring at the interface of the jet head and collimated jet would also be radiation mediated . at such shocks , photons produced in the downstream diffuse into the upstream and",
    "interact with electrons or pairs .",
    "there would not be a strong shock jump any more and fermi acceleration no longer works @xcite .",
    "however , this case is changed for ll - grbs @xcite and ul - grbs @xcite .",
    "because of low power or large radii , the thomson optical depth is low even inside a star @xcite so that efficient fermi acceleration would be expected .",
    "we consider ll - grbs and ul - grbs separately and they fall into different collimation regimes , which will be talked about later .    due to the first order fermi acceleration , the accelerated proton spectrum is @xcite : @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the proton energy and number density .",
    "we optimistically take @xmath40 in our calculation .",
    "the minimum proton energy @xmath41 and maximum energy @xmath42 is determined by the balance between proton acceleration and cooling process .",
    "in this regime , the jet head moves forward with a non - relativistic velocity , @xmath43 .",
    "the unshocked jet s lorentz factor in the head frame is @xmath44 .",
    "we can easily see that the reverse shock is strong while the forward shock is so weak that we need not consider .",
    "the internal energy of the shocked jet is @xmath45 .",
    "in addition , we deduce some crucial terms below analytically ( see * ? ? ? * appendix b ) .",
    "@xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48 where @xmath23 is the initial jet opening angle and @xmath49 is the opening angle after collimation .",
    "fortunately , @xmath50 do not vary with radius when and only when @xmath36 .",
    "the internal energy @xmath51 we assume the energy equipartition factor @xmath52 and thus we can get the comoving magnetic field by @xmath53 @xmath54 because of the large opacity of the envelope , the radiation of relativistic electrons will be thermalized , with a typical black body temperature @xmath55 @xmath56^{1/4}l_j^{1/6}a^{1/12}r^{-1/2}\\theta_0^{-4/15}.\\eqno ( 11)\\ ] ] the average number density of thermal photons is @xmath57    furthermore , in order to get the numerical values , we adopt the typical values of ll - grbs , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , which suggests @xmath60 .",
    "so the lorentz factor of collimated jet is @xmath61@xcite . according to @xcite and @xcite",
    ", we assume a typical progenitor with a helium core of mass @xmath62 and radius @xmath63 cm so that the ambient envelope density can be expressed as @xmath64 . from equation (",
    "8) we get @xmath65 so that this ll - grb meets the requirement @xmath24 . moreover , fermi acceleration is efficient because the thomson optical depth is @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the possible effect by pair production @xcite .",
    "now we can get @xmath68 g , @xmath69 , @xmath70 .",
    "remember that this is measured in the rest frame of the jet head .",
    "a high energy proton loses its energy through radiative and hadronic process .",
    "the radiative cooling includes synchrotron and inverse compton scattering , with typical cooling timescales @xcite : @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath73 where the subscripts @xmath74 represent the thomson limit and klein - nishina limit of inverse compton scattering , @xmath75 is the thomson cross section and average photon energy @xmath76 . if the proton energy @xmath38 is in units of gev , the numerical values of the timescales given above are @xmath77 hadronic cooling mechanisms mainly contain proton - proton collision , the bethe - heitler interaction and photopion production in the following ways respectively , @xmath78 @xmath79 @xmath80 we can expect muon neutrinos to be produced in pp and photopion process , via charged pion or kaon decay . here",
    "we do not consider the secondary electron neutrino production .",
    "the cooling timescale of pp collision is @xmath81 we estimate the proton number density in the shocked jet as @xmath82 . assuming in each collision a fraction 20% of the proton energy is lost and @xmath83 @xcite",
    ", we can get @xmath84",
    ".    at relative higher energy , the protons start to cool through the bethe - heiter interaction , for which the energy loss every times is @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the lorentz factor of the center of inertia in the comoving frame and can be expressed as @xmath87 .",
    "the bh cross section is given by @xmath88 $ ] , so the bh cooling time is @xcite @xmath89    the photopion production dominates the cooling even at higher energy .",
    "we adopt the photopion cross section described in @xcite and @xcite as a broken power law : @xmath90 for @xmath91 and @xmath92 for @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the photon energy in the proton rest frame .",
    "thus the cooling timescale is @xmath95 where the conventional inelasticity @xmath96/2 $ ] and @xmath97 is the invariant mass of the system .",
    "the timescale of the first order fermi acceleration is @xmath98 .",
    "if the diffusion coefficient is assumed to be proportional to the bohm diffusion coefficient and @xmath99 is taken to be the common value @xmath100 @xcite , then @xmath101 .",
    "we now can plot the inverse of all these timescales as functions of proton energy in figure  [ figure 1 ] .",
    "the maximum proton energy can be obtained by @xmath102 , so @xmath103 .",
    "hence we expect the maximum neutrino energy produced by this ll - grb as @xmath104 .",
    "we can define two threshold proton energies @xmath105 and @xmath106 , corresponding to @xmath107 and @xmath108 respectively @xcite .",
    "we know that the proton - proton collision and photopion process will produce muon neutrinos while the bethe - heitler interaction does not .",
    "hence , if the proton energy @xmath38 falls into the range @xmath109 , the bh interaction dominates and has a strong suppression on the final neutrino spectrum .",
    "this suppression factor can be written as @xmath110 , @xmath111    further on , the cooling of a meson also needs to be considered .",
    "it is similar to protons that the radiative and the hadronic cooling times are @xmath112 @xmath113 where @xmath114 is in units of gev , the numerical values are @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 .",
    "same as @xcite , for our jet parameters , the meson goes from decay dominated to radiation cooling dominated .",
    "we can define the break energy for neutrinos , @xmath118 satisfies @xmath119 , and thus the suppression factor due to meson cooling is expressed as @xmath120    with the cooling suppression effect of both protons and mesons , we obtain the final neutrino flux @xcite @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the meson multiplicity ( 1 for pions and 0.1 for kaons ) , @xmath123 is the branching ratio of meson decay into neutrinos ( 1 for pions and 0.6 for kaons ) , and @xmath124 is the fraction of the primary proton energy carried by neutrinos , regardless of energy loss ( 1/8 for pions and 1/4 for kaons ) .",
    "the factor @xmath125 normalizes the proton spectrum to the jet power . in this paper , we just assume that the highly efficient acceleration occurs and take the acceleration efficiency @xmath126 so that @xmath127 .",
    "this is consistent with the fiducial value of baryon loading parameter @xmath128 according to @xcite .",
    "so we plot in figure  [ figure 2 ] the flux of neutrinos for the ll - grb jet mentioned above , with luminosity @xmath60 , initial opening angle @xmath59 .",
    "we assume that this ll - grb is at a rather close distance @xmath129 .",
    "we can see that at low energy end , @xmath130 suggests a power law neutrino spectrum .",
    "the neutrino number from kaon decay is one or two orders of magnitude more than that from pions at high energy end .",
    "it is mainly because kaons are heavier and experience less energy loss@xcite .",
    "a sharp jump is obvious in the spectrum due to the transition of dominance from the bh interaction to photopion process in proton cooling mechanisms thus prominently more neutrinos are produced , that is to say , it is caused by @xmath131 .",
    "we now can simply estimate the neutrino events for this ll - grb in icecube .",
    "we use the following fitting formula of the probability of detecting muon neutrinos @xcite .",
    "@xmath132 where @xmath133 for @xmath134 , while @xmath135 for @xmath136 .",
    "the number of muon neutrinos from a burst are given by @xmath137 using a geometrical detector area of @xmath138 , the expected neutrino number is @xmath139 for above ll - grb with a neutrino emission duration of @xmath140 .",
    "thus it is not easy to be detected now .      in this case , the jet is still collimated but the head velocity will become subrelativistic .",
    "similar to the above discussions , we deduce some crucial terms below , @xmath141 @xmath142 @xmath143 @xmath144 @xmath145 @xmath146 the internal energy of the shocked ambient medium by fs and the shocked jet by rs are @xmath147    the protons will be accelerated simultaneously by fs and rs , but the forward shock s contribution is negligible for the reason that the fs would be radiation mediated , and the shock acceleration would be inefficient . in this case , we choose an ultra - long grb with @xmath148 and @xmath149 , which suggests @xmath150 the extreme long duration @xmath151s suggests a progenitor like a blue supergiant ( bsg ) of radii up to @xmath152 .",
    "we assume this bsg with a helium core of mass @xmath62 and radius @xmath153 cm so that the envelope density can be expressed as @xmath154 .",
    "the assumed radius may be relatively larger than that of typical bsg , but we choose this value in order to realize efficient fermi acceleration here .",
    "these parameters are possible according to @xcite and then we focus on the neutrino emission of this single ul - grb . from equation",
    "( 21 ) we get @xmath155 thus this ul - grb satisfies @xmath25 .",
    "the thomson optical depth is @xmath156 so fermi acceleration for rs is efficient . in line with the observation now ( see @xcite ) , we assume this ul - grb at a relatively close distance @xmath157 . we calculate the neutrino flux for rs",
    "then we plot it in figure  [ figure 3 ] .",
    "the maximum proton energy @xmath42 can be obtained by @xmath102 , and the maximum neutrino energy produced by this ul - grb is @xmath158 .",
    "also , greater total neutrino fluence is exhibited in this ul - grb case .",
    "same as before , the expected neutrino number in icecube for this ul - grb is @xmath159 , with a neutrino emission duration of @xmath160 .",
    "this case corresponds to the uncollimated regime .",
    "that is , the collimation effect is weak and to a good approximation the jet remains conical .",
    "the head will move forward with an relativistic velocity , @xmath161 . in this case , we have @xmath162 @xmath163 @xmath164 @xmath165 @xmath166    unfortunately , this situation is not suitable for high energy neutrino production .",
    "the reason is that , to meet the requirement @xmath26 , we need @xmath167 for @xmath168 in the helium core we previously assumed . leaving aside the existence of such a powerful jet , the fermi acceleration is no longer efficient and meson cooling in this jet is so severe that there will be hardly any high energy neutrinos .",
    "hence we do not need to carry on .",
    "it is reasonable to argue that the final neutrino flux depends on the density profile of progenitor envelope .",
    "apparently , with the same assumed envelope mass and radius , different values of the power law index lead to different ambient envelope density , which directly influence the cocoon pressure and the collimation of the jet@xcite .",
    "moreover , changing the power law index does affect the jet dynamics and result in different dependency on radius ( we will see later ) .",
    "these two reasons cause the revision of collimation effect on the final neutrino spectrum being different . for the sake",
    ", we would like to study the influence of the different values of the power law index of the density profile . here",
    "we display one situation ( ul - grb ) for simplicity and clearness .",
    "we still use the progenitor envelope properties of a helium core of mass @xmath169 and radius @xmath170 , but with @xmath171 . respectively ,",
    "we can write them as @xmath172 and @xmath173 .",
    "surely , we could repeat all those calculations above for @xmath174 .    for a successful jet in the condition @xmath175",
    ", we show the crucial , analytical quantities for @xmath176 , @xmath177 @xmath178 @xmath179 and for @xmath180 , @xmath181 @xmath182 @xmath183 in all of three cases @xmath184 , we only consider the reverse shock s contribution to the final high energy neutrino flux and we plot it in figure  [ figure 4 ] .",
    "same as before , we could get the maximum neutrino energy and it is @xmath185 respectively . once we could correlate an observed high energy ( @xmath186 ) neutrino precursor with a grb in the future , we can constrain the envelope property of progenitor by maximum neutrino energy .",
    "we can see in this figure that @xmath1 has a visible influence on the total neutrino flux , though not so prominent .",
    "differences occur mostly at the high energy end . also , the energy at which the neutrino spectrum peaks and the maximum neutrino energy in these three cases are a bit different . for a steeper envelope density profile ,",
    "the density of the jet material and the outer envelope at which neutrino production begins is generally smaller .",
    "hence , the steepest @xmath180 case encounters the least cooling impact at high energy end thus leading to a highest maximum neutrino energy and a greatest neutrino flux .",
    "anyway , we can make this dependency more striking , for example , by choosing @xmath187 .",
    "this could result in several times distinction compared to @xmath36 case at high energy end . however , given the energy resolution of icecube now , these differences are so small that we can hardly distinguish . here",
    "we just provide an alternative way to probe the stellar structure and wish to do this if we could realize better energy resolution in the future .",
    "the main calculation of our paper is based on the jet propagation dynamics developed by @xcite , and we further consider the neutrino emission during the jet propagation process .",
    "this neutrino emission serves as a precursor signal prior to grb prompt emission .",
    "we differ from @xcite at the point that we deal with the high energy neutrino emission produced by shocks formed at the jet head , while they focused on internal shocks .",
    "we have similar handle on the calculation with @xcite but our result may be very different from theirs , because they adopted a progenitor model from @xcite with a simplified dynamics in which the jet opening angle remains constant and thus just ignored the collimation effect , which should play an important role .",
    "collimation depends on the jet luminosity @xmath19 , initial opening angle @xmath23 and the progenitor density profile .",
    "we calculate in detail the high energy neutrino flux in each collimation regime , and choose the promising ll - grbs and ul - grbs as high energy neutrino sources , leading to a more likely result . and what is more , we discuss the dependence of maximum neutrino energy and high energy neutrino flux on the progenitor density profile .",
    "high energy neutrinos can be produced while the jet is still propagating in the envelope .",
    "these neutrinos appear as a precursor signal , with energy ranges from gev to pev .",
    "analytically , we calculate this neutrino flux . to handle this",
    ", we first need to determine whether the jet is in collimation regime .",
    "collimation has a crucial effect on jet propagation dynamics .",
    "we adopt the previous propagation framework developed by @xcite .",
    "we assume separated cases ( ll - grbs and ul - grbs ) in which fermi first order acceleration works and they fall into different collimation regimes . with a power law spectrum",
    "of accelerated protons with @xmath40 , then we calculate the neutrino flux in various situations .    at low energy end",
    ", we always get @xmath130 and this suggests a power law neutrino spectrum .",
    "neutrinos are mainly produced by proton - proton collision .",
    "as the neutrino energy goes higher , a sharp jump is obvious in the spectrum because of photopion process starting to dominate thus more neutrinos are expected .",
    "moreover , the neutrino flux from kaon decay is almost two orders of magnitude more than that from pions at high energy end . it is mainly because kaons are heavier and experience less energy loss .    in our expectation ,",
    "the final neutrino flux will depend on the density profile parameter @xmath1 .",
    "we take @xmath184 to verify this dependence .",
    "we get a good result in figure  [ figure 4 ] , which shows that the dependence is existing .",
    "besides , the maximum neutrino energy for three cases is @xmath185 respectively . at a given radius ,",
    "the density of the jet material is lower for a steeper envelope density profile .",
    "there is less cooling impact so that a higher maximum neutrino energy and a greater high energy neutrino flux is expected .    in this paper",
    ", we only calculate the high energy neutrino flux of one grb for given parameters , but it is not easy to be detected by the current instruments .",
    "we wish to obtain a diffuse grb neutrino background which can be correlated with current observations in our future work .",

    "<S> relativistic jets are universal in long - duration gamma - ray burst ( grb ) models . before breaking out </S>",
    "<S> , they must propagate in the progenitor envelope along with a forward shock and a reverse shock forming at the jet head . </S>",
    "<S> both electrons and protons will be accelerated by the shocks . </S>",
    "<S> high energy neutrinos could be produced by these protons interacting with stellar materials and electron - radiating photons . </S>",
    "<S> the jet will probably be collimated , which may have a strong effect on the final neutrino flux . under the assumption of a power - law stellar - envelope density profile @xmath0 with an index @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate this neutrino emission flux by these shocks for low - luminosity grbs ( ll - grbs ) and ultra - long grbs ( ul - grbs ) in different collimation regimes , using the jet propagation framework developed by @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we find that ll - grbs and ul - grbs are capable for detectable high energy neutrinos up to @xmath2 , and obtain the final neutrino spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> besides , we conclude that larger @xmath1 corresponds to greater neutrino flux at high energy end ( @xmath2 ) and higher maximum neutrino energy as well </S>",
    "<S> . however , such differences are so small that it is not promising for us to distinguish from observations , given the energy resolution we have now . </S>"
