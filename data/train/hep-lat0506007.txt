    "studying the relation of non - perturbative features of qcd , such as confinement and dynamical chiral symmetry breaking , to the properties of propagators , there are two popular approaches at present : lattice gauge theory and dyson - schwinger equations ( dse ) . the latter approach allows to address directly the low - momentum region for a coupled system of quark , gluon and ghost propagators which is of interest for hadron physics @xcite .",
    "in particular their infrared behavior could be related to the mechanism of dynamical symmetry breaking and to confined gluons @xcite .",
    "in fact , the dse approach has revealed that in the infrared momentum region a diverging ghost propagator @xmath6 is intimately connected with a suppressed gluon propagator @xmath7 . in landau gauge , they can be written as @xmath8 here @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote the dressing functions of the corresponding propagators .",
    "they describe the deviation from the momentum dependence of the free propagators . based on the dyson - schwinger approach and under mild assumptions these functions",
    "are predicted to behave in the limit @xmath11 as follows @xcite : @xmath12 with exponents satisfying @xmath13 . in landau gauge @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "thus the ghost propagator diverges stronger than @xmath15 and the gluon propagator is infrared suppressed .",
    "this is in agreement with the zwanziger - gribov horizon condition @xcite as well as with the kugo - ojima confinement criterion @xcite .",
    "zwanziger  @xcite has suggested that in the continuum this behavior of the propagators in landau gauge results from the restriction of the gauge fields to the gribov region @xmath16 , where the faddeev - popov operator is non - negative .    using further the ghost - ghost - gluon vertex , the gluon and ghost dressing functions can be used to determine a renormalization group invariant running coupling in a momentum subtraction scheme as @xcite @xmath17 which then enters the quark dse @xcite .",
    "this definition relies on the fact that the ghost - ghost - gluon vertex renormalization function @xmath18 is constant , which is true at least to all orders in perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "indeed , a recent numerical investigation of @xmath19 for the @xmath20 case shows that also nonperturbatively @xmath19 is finite and constant @xcite . applying the behavior given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : infrared - behavior ] ) the running coupling approaches a finite value @xmath21 for @xmath22 at zero momentum in the dse approach @xcite .    nevertheless , numerical investigations of those features in lattice simulations are still necessary to check to what extent the truncation of the coupled set of dses influences the final result .",
    "there are several studies in landau gauge which confirm the anticipated behavior at least for the @xmath20 case @xcite",
    ". also lattice studies ( @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) for the @xmath0 case indicate the correctness of the proposed infrared behavior . however , as recent dse investigations show @xcite the infrared behavior of the gluon and ghost dressing functions and of the running coupling is changed on a torus .",
    "in particular , the running coupling decreases at low momenta .    this paper presents a lattice study of the gluon and ghost dressing functions and of the running coupling at low momenta in @xmath0 landau gauge .",
    "we also focus , more carefully than usually , on the problem of the gribov ambiguity in lattice simulations . in continuum , a gauge orbit has more than one intersection ( gribov copies @xcite ) with the transversality plane ( where @xmath23 holds for the gauge potential @xmath24 ) within the gribov region @xmath16 .",
    "expectation values taken over this region are argued to be equal to those over the fundamental modular region @xmath25 which includes only the absolute maximum of the gauge functional  @xcite .    on a finite lattice ,",
    "however , this equality can not be expected  @xcite . in the literature",
    "it is widely taken for granted that the gluon propagator does not depend on the choice of gribov copy , while an impact on the @xmath20 ghost propagator has been observed @xcite . however , in a more recent investigation  @xcite an influence of the gribov copies ambiguity on the @xmath0 gluon propagator has been demonstrated , too .",
    "here we assess the importance of the gribov ambiguity on a finite lattice for the @xmath0 ghost propagators .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sect : definitions ] we shall define all quantities which are investigated in this study . then , after specifying the lattice setup used , the dependence of the gluon and ghost propagator on the choice of gribov copies and lattice discretization as well as finite - volume effects are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sect : propagators ] .",
    "we also discuss the problem of exceptional gauge copies in sec .",
    "[ sect : exceptional ] . in sec .",
    "[ sect : running_coupling ] the behavior of the running coupling is presented . in appendix",
    "[ sect : pcg ] we show how the inversion of the f - p operator can be accelerated by pre - conditioning with a laplacian operator .",
    "to study the ghost and gluon propagators using lattice simulations one has to fix the gauge for each thermalized @xmath0 gauge field configuration @xmath26 .",
    "we adopted the landau gauge condition which can be implemented by searching for a gauge transformation @xmath27 which maximizes the landau gauge functional @xmath28 = \\frac{1}{4v}\\sum_{x}\\sum_{\\mu=1}^{4}{\\mathfrak{re}\\,}{\\mbox{tr}}\\;{}^{g}u_{x,\\mu }    \\label{eq : functional}\\ ] ] while keeping the monte carlo configuration @xmath29 fixed . here",
    "@xmath30 are elements of @xmath0 .",
    "the functional @xmath31 $ ] has many different local maxima which can be reached by inequivalent gauge transformations @xmath32 , the number of which increases with the lattice size . as the inverse coupling constant @xmath33",
    "is decreased , increasingly more of those maxima become accessible by an iterative gauge fixing process starting from a given ( random ) gauge transformation @xmath30 .",
    "the different gauge copies corresponding to those maxima are called _ gribov copies _ , due to their resemblance to the gribov ambiguity in the continuum @xcite .",
    "all gribov copies @xmath34 belong to the same gauge orbit created by the monte carlo configuration @xmath29 and satisfy the differential landau gauge condition ( lattice transversality condition ) @xmath35 where @xmath36 here @xmath37 is the non - abelian ( hermitian ) lattice gauge potential which may be defined at the midpoint of a link @xmath38 in this way it is accurate to @xmath39 .",
    "the bare gauge coupling @xmath40 is related to the inverse lattice coupling via @xmath41 in the case of @xmath0 . in the following",
    ", we will drop the label @xmath32 for convenience , _ _ we consider @xmath29 to be already put into the landau gauge such that @xmath42 maximizes the functional in eq .",
    "( [ eq : functional ] ) relative to the neighborhood of the identity .",

    "according to ref .",
    "@xcite , however , a subset of lattice momenta @xmath49 has been considered only for the final analysis of the gluon propagator , although the fft algorithm provides us with all lattice momenta .",
    "details are given below .",
    "assuming reality and rotational invariance we envisage for the ( continuum ) gluon propagator the general tensor structure : @xmath52 with @xmath53 and @xmath54 being scalar functions . on the lattice",
    "these functions are extracted by projection and are expected to scatter , rather than being smooth functions of @xmath55 .",
    "using the landau gauge condition the longitudinal form factor @xmath56 vanishes . recalling the mentioned gribov ambiguity of the chosen gauge copy",
