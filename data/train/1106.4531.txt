    "during the past ten years , much attention has been drawn to the study of the following nonlocal equation @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a probability density on @xmath6 and @xmath7 a given nonlinearity .",
    "such kind of equations appear in various applications ranging from population dynamics to ising models as seen in @xcite among many references . here",
    "we will only be concerned with probability densities @xmath5 which satisfy the following assumption : @xmath8 and nonlinearities @xmath7 of monostable type , e.g. @xmath9}\\le 0 . \\end{aligned}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] such nonlinearities are commonly used in population dynamics to describe the interaction ( birth , death ,  ) of a species in its environment as described in @xcite .",
    "our analysis in this paper will mainly focus on the travelling wave solutions of equation these particular type of solutions are of the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a given unit vector , the velocity @xmath12 and the scalar function @xmath13 satisfy @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the limit of @xmath16 as @xmath17 and @xmath1 is the real function defined as @xmath18 where @xmath19 .",
    "thus we shall assume that the kernel @xmath1 satisfies @xmath20 we will call a solution @xmath21 to  a travelling wave or travelling front if it is non - decreasing .",
    "the first works to study travelling fronts in this setting are due to schumacher @xcite and in related nonlocal problems by weinberger @xcite who constructed travelling fronts satisfying some exponential decay for @xmath1 symmetric and particular monostable nonlinearities , the so called kpp nonlinearity , e.g. @xmath22 then , harris , hudson and zinner @xcite and more recently carr and chmaj @xcite , chen and guo @xcite and coville and dupaigne @xcite extended and completed the work of schumacher to more general monostable nonlinearities and dispersal kernels @xmath1 satisfying what is called in the literature the mollison condition @xcite : @xmath23 more precisely , they show that    [ thm symmetric trav wave ] @xcite let @xmath7 be a monostable nonlinearity , @xmath1 be a symmetric function satisfying - .",
    "then there exists a constant @xmath24 such that for all @xmath25 , there exists an increasing function @xmath13 , such that @xmath26 is a solution of - and for any @xmath27 , there exists no increasing solution of - .",
    "moreover , if in addition @xmath28 , then any bounded solution @xmath26 of - is unique up to translation .        in theorems  [",
    "thm symmetric trav wave ] and [ thm symmetric speed ] the dispersal kernel @xmath1 is assumed to be symmetric .",
    "this corresponds to the situation where the dispersion of the species is isotropic . since the dispersal of an individual can be influenced in many ways ( wind , landscape ,  )",
    ", it is natural to ask what happens when the kernel @xmath1 is non - symmetric . in this direction",
    ", we have the following result :    [ mono.th.sup ] let @xmath7 be a monostable nonlinearity satisfying and @xmath1 be a dispersal kernel satisfying .",
    "assume further that there exists @xmath31 with @xmath32 a super - solution of - in the sense : @xmath33 and such that @xmath34 for some @xmath35 .",
    "then there exists a critical speed @xmath36 , such that for all @xmath37 there exists a non decreasing solution @xmath26 to - and for @xmath27there exists no non - decreasing travelling wave with speed @xmath38 .",
    "we emphasize that in the above theorem we do not require monotonicity of the supersolution @xmath39 .",
    "the first consequence of theorem [ mono.th.sup ] is to relate the existence of a minimal speed @xmath29 and the existence of a travelling front for any speed @xmath40 to the existence of a supersolution . in other words",
    ", we have the following necessary and sufficient condition :        [ mono.th.mol ] let @xmath7 be a monostable nonlinearity and @xmath1 satisfy and mollison s condition .",
    "then there exists a critical speed @xmath36 , such that for all @xmath37 there exists a non decreasing function @xmath13 such that @xmath26 is a solution of - . while there is no non decreasing travelling wave with speed @xmath27 .",
    "* let us choose @xmath788 , with compact support and satisfying and , and such that @xmath64 .",
    "then by corollary  [ corollary velocity kpp ] we have @xmath789 .",
    "thus there exists a monotone travelling wave solution @xmath670 of - with speed @xmath3 .",
    "if - has a continuous solution @xmath671 , then by theorem [ mono.th.uniq ] and remark  [ one continuous ] we have @xmath790 . hence @xmath670 is monotone and continuous . then @xmath791 is monotone which implies that @xmath792 is monotone in @xmath204 .",
    "this is impossible if @xmath670 is continuous and @xmath784 is not monotone .    for the construction of infinitely many solutions",
    "we follow closely the work of @xcite . since @xmath726 and @xmath793 there are @xmath794 such that @xmath795 $ , $ g$ is increasing in $ [ b,1]$}\\ ] ] @xmath796$}.\\ ] ] define @xmath797 $ or $ u\\in [ b,1]$ } \\\\",

    "then by corollary  [ corollary velocity kpp ] the problem - with nonlinearity @xmath804 has critical speed @xmath96 independent of @xmath150 , and hence there exists a monotone solution @xmath142 @xmath805 notice that any solution to this problem is continuous and hence we may choose @xmath806 by helly s theorem there is a subsequence which converges pointwise to a solution @xmath13 of the following problem @xmath807 remark that @xmath808 , and @xmath809 , @xmath810 by lemma  [ lema 2.4 ] .",

    "then for @xmath825 we have @xmath826 and vanishes in a nonempty interval . by the maximum principle @xmath827 and",
    "this implies that @xmath13 is constant , which is a contradiction .",
