    "a decade ago , slonczewski@xcite and berger@xcite predicted that a spin - polarized current passing through a ferromagnet exerts a torque on its magnetic moment .",
    "the past decade has shown an abundance of experiments that have confirmed this theoretical prediction.@xcite since spin - polarized currents are easily generated by passing an electrical current through a ferromagnet , the ` spin transfer torque ' opens the way for all - electrical manipulation of nanoscale magnetic devices.@xcite    very recently , two groups have been able to use the spin torque to drive and detect ferromagnetic resonance in a ferromagnet  normal - metal  ferromagnet ( fnf ) trilayer.@xcite these experiments are designed such that the magnetization direction of one of the ferromagnets is fixed by anisotropy forces , whereas the other magnet is made of a softer ferromagnetic material or has a more symmetric shape so that its magnetization can more easily respond to the applied current or to an applied magnetic field . in both experiments ,",
    "an alternating electrical current is used to drive the ferromagnetic resonance , whereas the magnetization precession is detected through the dc voltage generated by rectification of the applied ac current by the time - dependent resistance of the device.@xcite the theoretical analysis of this experimental setup is the subject of this article .",
    "not only does a spin - polarized current have an effect on the direction of the magnetization of a ferromagnet , a time varying magnetization also causes the flow of spin currents in normal metal conductors in electrical contact to the ferromagnet .",
    "this ` spin emission ' was proposed by tserkovnyak , brataas , and bauer as the cause of enhanced damping of ferromagnetic resonance in thin ferromagnetic films in good electrical contact to a normal metal substrate.@xcite it is also the mechanism underlying berger s earlier prediction of the excitation of a dc voltage by a precessing magnetization in an unbiased fnf trilayer@xcite ( see also refs .  ) .",
    "spin emission affects the experiments of refs . and in two different ways .",
    "first , through the enhancement of the damping spin emission broadens the ferromagnetic resonance .",
    "second , the free layer s precessing magnetization emits alternating spin currents , which , in turn , generate a dc voltage through the time - varying spin - dependent conductance of the free layer.@xcite that way , spin emission provides an alternative to rectification of the applied ac current as a mechanism for the generation of a dc voltage in these experiments .",
    "our calculations show that both consequences of spin emission appear or disappear together : if spin emission gives a significant contribution to the damping of the ferromagnetic resonance  which is the case for the few nm - thick free - layer ferromagnets used in the experiments  , then it also provides a sizable contribution to the measured dc voltage , and vice versa .    in the remainder of this article we present the detailed theory of the electrical - current driven ferromagnetic resonance needed to arrive at the above conclusion .",
    "in addition , our theory allows us to calculate how the ferromagnetic resonance frequency , the resonance width , and the asymmetry of the resonance lineshape are affected by embedding the free ferromagnetic layer into the fnf trilayer .",
    "our calculation proceeds in three parts . in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] we derive general expressions for the spin transfer torque , which we then apply to the calculation of the magnetization motion in sec .",

    "the generated dc voltage is calculated in sec .",

    "we conclude in sec .",

    "a schematic drawing of the system we consider is shown in fig.[fig:1 ] .",
    "it consists of a ferromagnetic source reservoir , held at electric voltage @xmath0 , a thin normal - metal spacer layer , a thin ferromagnetic layer , and a normal - metal drain reservoir . the direction @xmath1 of the magnetization in the ferromagnetic source is considered to be fixed , whereas the direction @xmath2 of the magnetization in the thin layer can change under the influence of an electrical current or an applied magnetic field .",
    "= 0.7      the two sets of equations are slightly different because there are two ferromagnet  normal - metal interfaces between the spacer layer and the drain reservoir , whereas there is only one interface between the spacer layer and the source reservoir , see fig.[fig:1].@xcite also , in eq .",
    "( [ eq : jn ] ) , we omitted terms proportional to the time derivative @xmath23 because the magnetization of the source reservoir is held fixed .",

    "we omitted terms that represent the coherent transmission of electrons with spin not collinear with @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the effect of coherent transmission is small for ferromagnets much thicker than the ferromagnetic coherence length , which is usually on the order of only a couple of atomic layers .",
    "we refer to refs .   for a theory in which these processes are included . since the imaginary parts @xmath30 and @xmath31 of the mixing conductances are numerically small for metallic junctions ( 20% or less of @xmath32 and @xmath33),@xcite we set @xmath30 and @xmath31 to zero in the following calculations .",

    "both contributions are of similar magnitude for the thin ferromagnetic films used in the experiments .",
    "the presence of two mechanisms to generate a direct response to periodic driving , rather than one , sets this class of magnetic devices apart from their semiconductor counterparts .",
    "a direct experimental probe of the two contributions to the dc voltage is to compare the dc voltage observed in spin - torque driven ferromagnetic resonance with the dc voltage generated in conventional magnetic - field driven ferromagnetic resonance in the same device .",
    "the latter follows from rectification of emitted spin currents only .",
    "since spin emission gives a symmetric line shape around the resonance frequency @xmath95 there should be a clear difference between the two methods to excite ferromagnetic resonance .",
    "a comparison of the magnitudes of both contributions would require a calibration of the amplitude at which the magnetization precesses .",
