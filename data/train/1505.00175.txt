    "the successful exfoliation of black phosphorus ( bp)@xcite multilayers has triggered tremendous interests in this material , which is also one of the thermodynamically more stable phases of phosphorus , at ambient temperature and pressure . in comparison to other 2d materials , such as graphene , hexagonal boron nitride ( hbn ) , and transition metal dichalcogenides , multilayers bp has a direct bandgap which spans from @xmath3 @xcite , hence making it an excellent candidate for infrared optoelectronics @xcite .",
    "since each bp layer forms a puckered surface due to @xmath4 hybridization , it also reveals highly anisotropic electrical mobility @xcite , linear dichroism in optical absorption spectra@xcite , anisotropic excitonic structure@xcite and anisotropic plasmons @xcite .",

    "indeed , the high quality bp has made possible the first observation of prominent quantum magneto - oscillations in these devices@xcite and quantum hall effect@xcite .",
    "hence , theoretical studies of bp in the presence of a magnetic field has also begun receiving attention@xcite .    in this paper , we examine the electronic properties of bp multilayer thin film in perpendicular magnetic field , such as its landau level spectrum , ac conductivity , screening and its collective electronic excitations . in particular , we emphasize the manifestation of anisotropy in these experimentally observable quantities .",
    "we begin with a discussion of the model hamiltonian used to describe multilayer bp in section ii .",
    "this is followed by the study of its electronic subband structure in section iii , and its landau level spectrum in section iv .",
    "various experimentally relevant quantities such as ac conductivity , collective excitations and screening in the presence of magnetic field will be discussed in section v - vii respectively .",
    "in multilayer bp , broken translational symmetry in the out - of - plane @xmath5 direction renders the direct energy gap at the @xmath6 point instead of the z point in bulk .",

    "now the matrix hamiltonian is dimensionless , and the eigenvalue problem can be solved numerically .",
    "the procedure is as follows .",

    ", we need to introduce a truncation condition , which we set to @xmath92 . , we obtain the landau level spectrum , as shown in fig.[fig2](a)-(b ) for conduction and valence bands respectively .",
    "the dispersion is typical of 2d electron gas system , exhibiting linear dependence with @xmath67 .",
    "however , there are differences due to the finite inter - band coupling @xmath0 and anisotropy of bp , which will be discussed later . in the calculations , we set the doping to be @xmath48@xmath46 .",
    "we note that crossing of each landau level acquires additional carrier density of @xmath93@xmath46 , where @xmath94 is the spin degeneracy .",
    "hence , at the assumed doping of @xmath48@xmath46 and @xmath50 t , the filling factor is @xmath95 . for carrier densities larger than @xmath96@xmath46",
    ", the filling factor can be as large as @xmath97 .",
    "it might then be possible to observe multi - subband phenomena , especially for the hole case .",
    "for the experimental doping range , only the landau levels of the lowest two subbands are physically relevant .",
    "the anisotropy of the problem is encoded in the wavefunctions . in fig.[fig2](c ) we plot the wavefunction probability along the two in - plane spatial coordinates for the first two landau levels , expressed in their dimensionless coordinate ( i.e. , @xmath98 , @xmath99 ) .",
    "two respective gauges are used , i.e. , for gauges @xmath56 and @xmath100 , we get @xmath101 and @xmath102 respectively . due to the anisotropy inherent in the model hamiltonian , we can clearly discern the difference between probability distribution over these two gauges .",
    "we will show that this anisotropy in wave function can result in prominent anisotropy in various experimental quantities such as ac conductivities and magneto - plasmons . in fig.[fig2](d ) , the probability distribution over the eigenstates @xmath103 of the _ bare _ harmonic oscillator which forms the upper diagonal terms in eq.([heff ] ) is plotted . with the increase of landau level ,",

    "the inset depicts the transitions between the nearest landau levels for cases with @xmath119 to @xmath120 , i.e. the resonance for each case corresponds to a particular transition process @xmath103 to @xmath121 , and occurs at the terahertz frequencies .",
    "prominently , @xmath109 is about @xmath122 times larger than @xmath110 .",
    "we note the spatial anisotropy in the wavefunctions of the landau levels , albeit small , as shown in fig.[fig2]c .",
    "the anisotropy in the magneto - optical conductivity tensor arises mainly from the anisotropy in the velocity operators , i.e. @xmath123 and @xmath124 , which accounts for the anisotropic optical transitions dipole .",
    "we should point out here that the resonant structure observed here in bp is more like conventional 2d electron gas rather than in graphene@xcite , which has multiple resonant structures .",
    "contrary to the conventional case , we find here that the resonant frequency is slightly red - shifted with increasing doping ( or @xmath116 ) .",

    "[ fig : mp ] , a similar spectrum is found for the hole doped case , with the difference that the separation between consecutive horizontal lines is narrower for the latter , due to larger effective mass of the valence band as compared to the conduction band .",
    "we next consider the effect of coulomb interaction within the random phase approximation ( rpa ) , which _ dresses _ the electron - hole polarization function as @xmath160 where the dielectric function is obtained as @xmath161 in terms of the non - interacting polarization function @xmath162 and the two - dimensional coulomb potential in momentum space @xmath163 where @xmath164 is the background dielectric constant .",
    "the strength of the coulomb interaction is usually expressed in terms of the dimensionless parameter @xmath165 , where the band mass in the present case is @xmath166 , and @xmath167 in terms of the carrier density @xmath168 .",
    "long - range electron - electron interaction leads to the appearance of collective plasmon modes in the spectrum .",
    "their dispersion relation can be calculated from the zeros of the dielectric function . in fig .",
    "[ fig : mp](c ) and ( d ) we show how the non - interacting electron - hole spectrum [ shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mp](a ) an ( b ) ] is modified due to interactions .",
    "the electron - hole horizontal lines of fig . [ fig : mp](a ) and ( b ) acquire a dispersion , leading to the so - called magneto - excitons or magneto - plasmons .",
    "as in the @xmath159 case,@xcite coulomb interaction leads to highly anisotropic magneto - plasmons , with higher dispersion for @xmath128 than for @xmath127 directions .",
    "this is due to the fact that the _ effective _ mass is smaller in the @xmath140 direction than in the @xmath141 direction .",
    "we also notice that the excitation spectrum of bp greatly differs from that of doped graphene .",
    "in fact , the characteristic linear dispersion relation in graphene leads to a _ relativistic _",
    "quantization of the spectrum into a set of non - equidistant lls.@xcite as a consequence , long range coulomb interaction in graphene leads to a set of highly dispersing _ linear _ magneto - plasmons,@xcite that differs from the equidistant magnetoexcitons ( separated by a well defined cyclotron frequency energy , @xmath156 ) in bp .",
    "in this section we focus on the properties of @xmath169 and @xmath170 in the static limit , for which the polarization function is entirely real .",
    "the polarizability of bp in a strong magnetic field is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : staticscreening](a ) .",
    "one first observe that , as in a standard 2deg,@xcite the static polarizability tends to zero as @xmath171 for @xmath172 .",
    "the reason for this is that the main contribution to @xmath173 comes from @xmath174 excitations in the vicinity of the fermi energy @xmath36 .",
    "this differs from the @xmath159 case , for which the fermi level cuts the band and there are @xmath174 excitations . in the integer quantum hall regime",
    ", however , @xmath36 lies in the cyclotron gap between the highest occupied ll @xmath139 and the lowest unoccupied one @xmath157 . since this energy gap",
    "must be overcome by excitations with @xmath174 , then its spectral weight tends to zero .",
    "notice that @xmath175 coincides with the density of states at the fermi energy because the latter vanishes for @xmath176 when @xmath36 lies in the gap .",
    "one also notices that the wave - vector at which the polarizability starts to vanish ( @xmath177 ) is larger for @xmath178 that for @xmath179 , due to the anisotropy of the bp fermi surface . one further notices the oscillatory behavior of the static polarizability , below @xmath177 , due to the wave - function overlap between the electron and the hole , leading to @xmath157 maxima.@xcite    it is interesting to compare the screening properties of bp and graphene , and we start by briefly discussing the @xmath159 case .",
    "for @xmath180 we have @xmath181 , where @xmath182 is the 2d thomas - fermi wave - vector , in terms of the density of states @xmath183 . since the density of states ( per unit area ) is approximately a constant equal to @xmath184 for bp , where @xmath185 accounts for the spin degeneracy , whereas for graphene @xmath183 is energy dependent and given approximately by @xmath186 , where @xmath187 is the fermi velocity and @xmath188 accounts for spin and valley degeneracy , one obtains a density independent @xmath189 for bp , whereas it scales as @xmath190 for graphene .",
    "therefore , in the two cases and for @xmath159 , the dielectric function diverges as @xmath191 when @xmath192.@xcite however , it is important to notice that the density dependence in the numerator of @xmath193 in graphene implies the absence of screening in undoped graphene ( i.e. for @xmath194 ) at long distances . for short wavelengths @xmath195 , @xmath196 in a bp ,",
    "whereas for graphene , @xmath197 .",
    "the extra contribution @xmath198 to the dielectric function of graphene at @xmath195 is related to virtual inter - band particle - hole excitations.@xcite in summary , at short wavelengths and for @xmath159 , bp ( like a standard 2deg ) does not screen at all ( @xmath199 ) , whereas graphene screens as a dielectric due to its filled valence band .",
    "the above picture changes in the presence of a quantizing magnetic field . in fig .",
    "[ fig : staticscreening ] we have plotted the static polarization and dielectric functions for bp , respectively . at long wavelengths , @xmath200 . in the limit of @xmath201 , the known result for a 2deg and for graphene,@xcite @xmath202 as @xmath180 , applies also for bp .",
    "the difference between graphene and bp is encoded in the density dependence of @xmath203 in the two cases : since @xmath204 in bp , @xmath205 grows linearly with @xmath139 in this case .",
    "however , @xmath206 is density - independent in graphene , leading to a dielectric function proportional to @xmath207 . on the other hand , in both graphene and bp , @xmath208 as @xmath180 , which implies that there is no screening at long distances .",
    "finally , the behavior of the dielectric function in a magnetic field at @xmath195 in bp is similar to the @xmath159 limit , corresponding to the standard metallic like screening governed by intra - band processes.@xcite",
    "in conclusion , we have examined the electronic properties of 2d electron gas in black phosphorus multilayers due to the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "we highlight in this work the in - plane anisotropy reflected in various experimental quantities such as its ac magneto - conductivity , screening , and collective excitations .",
