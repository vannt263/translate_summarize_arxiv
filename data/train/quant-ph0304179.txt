    "discrimination between quantum mechanical states is a standard task in quantum communication protocols .",
    "typically , the signals are represented by non - orthogonal quantum states , often even in the form of mixed states due to the effect of noisy transmission channels .",
    "it is known that non - orthogonal pure states can not be discriminated exactly , that means , with full efficiency without any error .",
    "however , it is possible to discriminate between them unambiguously in a certain fraction of the cases .",
    "this problem was formulated by dieks @xcite and ivanovic @xcite for two pure states with equal _ a priori _ probabilities , and was elegantly solved by peres @xcite .",
    "the more general scenario of two pure states with arbitrary _ a priori _ probabilities was investigated and solved by jaeger and shimony @xcite .",
    "more general scenarios with a higher number of signal states were treated , with analytic results for signal states that satisfy certain symmetries @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it is only recently that the problem of generalization to mixed states has been considered .",

    "@xcite solved other special cases , for example that of two density matrices of rank @xmath5 in a @xmath0-dimensional subspace .",
    "finally , necessary and sufficient conditions for optimality and some numerical methods are discussed by fiurasek and jezek @xcite and by eldar @xcite .    in this article , we present two theorems that allow to reduce the general problem of optimal unambiguous state discrimination of two density matrices to standard forms .",
    "this standard problem can be formulated as optimal unambiguous state discrimination of two density matrices of rank @xmath0 that are defined in a minimal hilbert space of dimension @xmath1 .",
    "we show that the previously given examples involving density matrices can be reduced effectively to the optimal unambiguous state discrimination of two pure states , as solved by jaeger and shimony @xcite .",
    "the next challenge is therefore to discriminate two density matrices with a two dimensional rank in a four dimensional hilbert space .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present the mathematical background of the unambiguous state discrimination and introduce some notations . then , in section iii and iv , based on a geometrical approach , we present two theorems to simplify the problem of unambiguous state discrimination between two arbitrary density matrices . in section",
    "v , we propose a brief discussion on the consequences of the two previous theorems including a generalization to discrimination between more than two density matrices .",

    "these cost functions provide a figure of merit for different measurements .",
    "optimal unambiguous state discrimination is an extreme case in that we are looking for a measurement that either identifies a state uniquely ( conclusive result ) or fails to identify it ( inconclusive result ) .",

    "@xmath34 is a hilbert subspace of @xmath27 .",
    "the complementary orthogonal subspace ( orthogonal complement ) of a subspace @xmath38 in @xmath27 , written @xmath39 , is the set of all the elements of @xmath27 orthogonal to @xmath38 .",
    "we then have @xmath40 , the direct sum of the two orthogonal subspaces .",
    "finally , we denote by @xmath41 the orthogonal projection onto the subspace @xmath38 .",
    "in the first theorem , we will consider the situation where the supports of the two density matrices have a common subspace . this is the case whenever we find that @xmath42 here @xmath43 is the hilbert space spanned by the two supports . in this case , it can be written as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the common subspace of the two supports , and @xmath46 , its orthogonal complement in @xmath43 .",
    "the first reduction theorem will eliminate the common subspace @xmath47 from the problem .",
    "the intuitive reason is that in this subspace no unambiguous discrimination is possible , so the population of the two density matrices on it will contribute always only to the failure probability , never to the conclusive results .",
    "this is made precise in the following theorem .",
    "+    reduction theorem for a common subspace + suppose we are given two density matrices @xmath20 and @xmath21 on @xmath43 with _ a priori _ probabilities @xmath22 and @xmath23 such that their respective supports @xmath48 and @xmath49 have a non - empty common subspace @xmath47 .",

    "@xcite already noticed it in their paper . the reduction is constructive given @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the second theorem corresponds to the elimination of the orthogonal part of one support with respect to the other , i.e. , @xmath190 and @xmath191 .",
    "the non - empty subspaces @xmath192 and @xmath193 can be found systematically .",
    "for example , @xmath192 can be found by projecting @xmath48 onto @xmath49 and then by taking the complementary orthogonal subspace in @xmath49 of that projection . as a matter of fact , this assures that we can reduce the general usd problem always to that of two density matrices of the same rank @xmath194 , @xmath195 , in a hilbert space of @xmath196 dimensions .",
    "indeed , if after the reduction the rank of @xmath104 is bigger than the rank of @xmath103 , then the subspace @xmath197 is at least of dimension @xmath198 and can be eliminated . with the help of the two above theorems , we can reduce any problem of discriminating unambiguously two density matrices @xmath20 and @xmath21 , with rank @xmath110 and @xmath111 respectively , in a hilbert space @xmath27 , into a problem of discriminating unambiguously two density matrices @xmath103 and @xmath104 with rank @xmath194 ( @xmath199 ) in @xmath200 , a 2@xmath194-dimensional hilbert space .",
    "the reduction is constructive .",
    "the first theorem allows us to split off the common subspace and the second theorem leads to the reduce problem of discriminating unambiguously two density matrices of the same rank .    as a consequence ,",
    "we can reduce , for example , the problem of usd between a pure state and a density matrix , the `` @xmath201 '' case , to the problem of discriminating unambiguously two pure states , that is to say the `` @xmath188 '' case , by splitting off @xmath192 of dimension @xmath5 .",
