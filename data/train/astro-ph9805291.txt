    "accurate estimates of mass loss rates from the satellite galaxies and globular clusters in orbit around the milky way offer the possibility of better understanding the dynamical history of the galaxy . when integrated over the entire population",
    ", such measurements would tell us about the current accretion rate onto the galaxy .",
    "this in turn would indicate whether the galaxy has grown significantly through the gradual process of tidal stripping and disruption of its satellites .",
    "the direct inference of mass loss rates from individual objects would place new constraints on detailed analytic or numerical dynamical models of these systems . in addition , the measurements could be used to identify satellites which are likely to have well - populated streams of tidal debris associated with them .    in particular , the formation , evolution and ultimate fate of the galactic globular clusters is a long standing puzzle in astrophysics .",
    "dynamically , globular clusters are clean and relatively simple systems , yet on close inspection they reveal a wealth of complex behaviour , including relaxation and evaporation from internal dynamical interactions and mass loss in response to the tidal field of the milky way @xcite .",
    "ideally we would like to be able to assess the importance of each of these processes for the evolution of individual globular clusters from observations .    of particular interest for mass - segregated , relaxed clusters",
    "is the differential mass loss of stars due to the different relative densities of low and high mass stars at various radii , and the consequence of this loss for the evolution of the present day mass function ( pdmf ) away from the initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "understanding the form of the imf of the current globulars is relevant for theories of star formation and globular cluster formation @xcite , and the related issue of how the galaxy was assembled .",
    "the mass function of a stellar system @xmath0 is defined as the number of stars @xmath1 in the mass interval @xmath2 . a common functional form chosen to approximate this distribution is @xmath3",
    "where @xmath4 is called the _ mass function index_. the pdmf @xmath4 of a cluster has been found to be related to the galactocentric radius @xmath5 and height above the galactic plane @xmath6 of the cluster ( capaccioli , ortolani & piotto 1991 ) . using simple semi - analytic models",
    "capaccioli , piotto & stiavelli ( 1993 ) showed that these correlations could be reproduced by evolving a population of globular clusters which all have the same initial imf in the tidal field of the milky way .",
    "similarly , in a comparison of several globular clusters piotto , cool & king ( 1997 ) found the luminosity function of ngc 6397 to be much flatter than m15 , m30 and m92 , and concluded that this could be due to the extreme dynamical evolution implied by its orbit calculated from its proper motion @xcite .",
    "in addition mcclure et al .",
    "( 1986 ) reported a dependence of the pdmf on metallicity , and djorgovski , piotto & capaccioli ( 1993 ) successfully incorporated this together with the trends in @xmath5 and @xmath6 into a trivariate analysis .",
    "in contrast , in a recent study of pal 1 , rosenberg et al .",
    "( 1997 ) found its mass function to be inconsistent with the trends in @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and metallicity and concluded that this could either be due to evaporation of low mass stars , or an intrinsically different imf .",
    "one step towards solving the puzzle of just how far the pdmf of a cluster differs from its imf is determining how to interpret the signatures of tidal effects in observations of globular clusters and other satellites . in the past",
    ", the limiting radii of galactic satellites ( which are assumed to correspond to the tidal radii @xmath7 imposed by the milky way ) have been interpreted using king s ( 1962 ) tidal radius formula @xmath8 where @xmath5 is the distance of the satellite from the galactic centre , @xmath9 is the mass of the satellite , and @xmath10 is the mass of the galaxy enclosed within @xmath5 . for the observed",
    "@xmath11 this formula has been used to : ( i ) find @xmath9 from the current @xmath5 @xcite ; ( ii ) estimate the pericentre of the satellite s orbit given the value for @xmath9 implied by its internal dynamics ( oh , lin & aarseth 1995 ; irwin & hatzidimitriou 1995  hereafter ih85 ) ; and ( iii ) compare the galaxy s tidal field with the satellite s internal field @xcite .",
    "such analyses have been complicated by the detection of ` extra - tidal ' stars around both dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( ih95 ; kuhn , smith & hawley 1996 ) and globular clusters ( grillmair et al .",
    "1995  hereafter g95 ; for a summary of current observations of both galactic and extra - galactic globular clusters , see grillmair 1998 ) , and these morphological features have been shown to be consistent with those seen in simulations of tidally disrupting systems @xcite .",
    "hut & djorgovski ( 1992 ) also estimated destruction rates of globular clusters by finding the extent to which their distribution of half - mass relaxation times deviates from a power law and interpreting this difference in terms of evolution of the system .",
    "an alternative to these very direct interpretations of observations is to build models that include some representation of all the expected dynamical effects on globular clusters and integrate the cluster s evolution over the lifetime of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "the success of these semi - analytic methods ( as with those in the previous paragraphs ) rests upon the representation of the physics involved , and there is some disagreement about the level of sophistication required for accurate predictions ",
    "one example is the theory of tidal shocking which has received renewed attention @xcite .",
    "however , all these studies predict that the milky way s globular cluster system is currently undergoing significant evolution .    in this paper , we return to the earlier philosophy of trying to understand how much we can learn directly from observations of tidal signatures .",
    "we approach the problem by using numerical simulations to assess how successfully such features can be interpreted .",
    "our study differs from earlier ones in several ways : ( i ) we include a mass spectrum , and begin with mass segregated models ; ( ii ) there is a one - one representation of stars in e.g. globular clusters ; and ( iii ) the tidal field of a full milky way model is included rather than idealised as giving rise to a spherical tidal boundary or being represented by a one - component potential . in our analysis , we explicitly distinguish between the bound and unbound stars in a satellite , which allows us to identify the characteristics of the extra - tidal population .",
    "we use this analysis to develop and test methods for quantifying the mass loss rate and evolution of the mass function of clusters and satellites directly from current observations .",
    "we present the simulation and analysis methods used throughout the paper in  2 .",
    "the simulations are used to provide an overview of the characteristics of evolution in a tidal field in  3 .",
    "we analyse our models from the viewpoint of an observer  4 . in  5 ,",
    "the interpretations developed in  4 are applied to observations and used to measure the rate of destruction of the milky way s satellite system .",
    "we summarise our results in  6 .",
    "in our calculations , the satellite is represented as a discrete set of particles of different masses , one for each star expected in a cluster of the chosen mass and mass function .",
    "the particular choice of cluster models in this paper follows the parameters adopted by chernoff &  weinberg ( 1990 ) ( see also sigurdsson & phinney 1995 ) . the initial particle masses , positions and velocities are taken from an explicit , maximal @xmath12 realisation of an isotropic michie  king model of a cluster @xcite , as described in  2.2 .",
    "the cluster s evolution along an orbit in a three component rigid model of the galaxy ( described in  2.3 ) is followed using a self - consistent field ( scf ) code to calculate the mutual interactions of stars in the cluster ( see  2.4.1 ) .",
    "the scf approach can not follow evolution due to close encounters of individual stars in the system , so we repeat one case with the effects of two - body encounters included via diffusion coefficients to illustrate their importance ( see  2.4.2 ) .",
    "this study is intended to isolate the response of a cluster to tidal effects with the dual purposes of identifying observable signatures of tidal interactions and providing a set of control models to compare to future studies which will include more of the physics that might influence the cluster s evolution .",
    "in particular , we make the following simplifications :    1 .",
    "the distribution of particle masses is chosen to represent an evolved stellar population with a turnoff at @xmath13 .",
    "we assume that continued stellar evolution is slow compared to the dynamical timescales involved .",
    "this assumption will be relaxed in subsequent papers , with explicit stellar evolution done in tandem with the dynamical evolution .",
    "the initial cluster models are truncated at some finite radius , @xmath14 , corresponding to the ` tidal radius ' of the king model .",
    "however , @xmath14 is not set to the limiting radius expected along each orbit , as a key purpose of the study is to investigate observable effects of tidal shocks and stripping of a cluster that is not in exact equilibrium with the tidal field .",
    "the chosen models and orbits cover a range of interaction strengths  from those that only survive a few orbits to those that could last for the lifetime of the galaxy .",
    "the scenario implicit in these initial conditions is that a cluster is formed very compact , with most of its mass well inside its actual tidal radius .",
    "mass loss during stellar evolution subsequent to the cluster s formation leads to expansion of the cluster , until the tidal radius is reached .",
    "here we assume that there is negligible loss of stars due to tidal effects until late in the cluster s evolution , and that we can start with a relaxed , mass segregated cluster with an exact king model profile , and follow subsequent mass loss due to tidal effects .",
    "clearly this is an approximation to the real physics , but in order to isolate the tidal effects we are exploring , the initial conditions of the cluster must be close to equilibrium or internal dynamical evolution will instead dominate .",
    "as noted above , the effects of two body encounters on the internal dynamical evolution have not been included in the majority of our models .",
    "in this paper we restrict detailed discussions to effects that are insensitive to these simplifications .",
    "for example , in  4 we use our models to test how a cluster s extra - tidal population can be used to determine its mass loss rate ",
    "we expect this to be valid because although the mass loss rate itself will depend on the internal dynamics of the system ( which we do not model exactly ) , the characteristics of the extra - tidal population are determined only by the tidal potential ( which we do model exactly ) .",
    "conversely , we do not attempt to arrive at quantitative conclusions in our discussion of the evolution of clusters along different orbits (  3 ) since these would be influenced by all three of the above simplifications .",

    "1996 ; ( 5 ) slope of extra - tidal star surface density profile ; ( 6 ) mass loss rate estimate from equation ( [ dfdt1 ] ) ; ( 7 ) mass loss rate estimate from equation ( [ dfdt2 ] ) ( 8) mass loss rate estimate from gnedin & ostriker ( 1997 ) .    table [ globstab ] presents the results of mass loss estimation for the 12 globular clusters analysed by g95 ( using their tables 3 - 14 , kindly made available to us by c. grillmair ) .",
    "four of these clusters have well - defined tidal tails with slopes @xmath15 ( given in column 5 ) , and in these cases both @xmath16 and @xmath17 are calculated . in the other cases ,",
    "only the latter estimate is made as an upper limit on the mass loss rate .",
    "the estimated limits for the mass loss rates range from a few to over 100 percent in the next gyr , again implying that the galaxy s globular cluster system will evolve substantially in the next hubble time .",
    "this provides observational support for the many purely theoretical studies that have reached the same conclusion using semi - analytic models @xcite .",
    "the last column shows the destruction rates predicted by gnedin &  ostriker ( 1997 ) .",
    "there is no striking correspondence between our ` observational ' results and the purely ` theoretical ' values .",
    "however , the upper limit we calculate is only in direct contradiction with the theoretical calculation in the cases of ngc 288 and ngc 1904 . in the former case",
    "our viewing angle is favourable for making an accurate estimate , but in the latter the value of @xmath18 is sufficiently large that we might expect the result to be confused by the debris geometry . in general , our mass loss rates are higher , but gnedin &  ostriker ( 1997 ) themselves point out that their destruction rates should be taken as a lower limit since the rates could be increased with the inclusion of other effects ignored in their study ( such as a mass - spectrum ) .",
    "the results in tables [ dsphtab ] and [ globstab ] should be treated with some caution as in most cases the observed densities of extra - tidal stars do not follow @xmath19 predicted by the simple model which we use to interpret the data . however , the original profiles were made either using star counts directly , or with additional photometry to subtract off some of the background .",
    "since we expect the tidal debris to typically have velocities within @xmath20 of the satellite , a study of radial velocities around a cluster has the potential of refining these measurements considerably .",
    "further in the future , the astrometric satellites sim ( the space interferometry mission ) and gaia ( the galactic astrometric imaging satellite ) promise proper motion measurements with a few @xmath21 accuracy ( or tangential velocities to better than 1 km s@xmath22 out to tens of kpc ) , and a similar advance in identifying debris .",
    "we have also , for the sake of simplicity , restricted our discussion to annularly averaged surface densities .",
    "clearly , more information is contained in two - dimensional surface density maps @xcite . however , these will be more sensitive to the orbital phase and the mass loss history of the satellite and would require more detailed analytic modeling to interpret .",
    "the method proposed in  4.5 uses observations of a cluster s pdmf and extra - tidal stars to place some limits on the imf .",
    "this is clearly a powerful tool for making progress towards understanding whether the imf is in any sense ` universal ' .",
    "of course it is non - trivial to find the global pdmf , the local mass function in the exterior , and to detect extra - tidal stars around a cluster .",
    "however , there are currently two examples in the literature where this has already been done  m15 and m55 ( see g95 ; piotto , cool & king 1997 ; zaggia et al .",
    "1997 ) . in the case of m15 , piotto ,",
    "cool & king ( 1997 ) argue that mass - segregation is important only in the centre of the cluster and that their local sample is a fair representation of the global pdmf .",
    "unfortunately , in the absence of mass segregation our method would find no evolution of the imf since it does not model differential mass - loss due to relaxation effects , but only steady stripping of the most weakly bound stars .",
    "( since piotto et al .",
    "1997 make the same statement about ngc 6397 , which has a very different @xmath4 from m15 , this might imply that the differences can only be due to relaxation effects or an intrinsically different imf ",
    "it is unclear whether this is a robust argument , or whether a low level of mass segregation farther out in the cluster might be sufficient to account for the differences through tidal shocking . ) in the case of m55 , zaggia , piotto & capaccioli ( 1997 ) find some evidence for extra - tidal stars , but do not give the density of this material since there are several other effects that it could be attributed to . despite these problems ,",
    "these studies show that it is currently feasible to design future observations that can address these issues .",
    "we summarise our main conclusions as follows :    1 .   observations of extra - tidal stars and enhanced velocity dispersions in the outskirts of clusters can be attributed to tidally stripped material .",
    "the star counts become dominated by unbound stars at the point where the slope of the surface density profile changes or the dispersion reaches a minimum .",
    "this should not be identified with the tidal radius of the cluster since the edge of the bound population can still lie significantly beyond this radius .",
    "the mass loss rate from a galactic satellite can be directly estimated from the population of extra - tidal stars within a few of its tidal radii , the orbital time period and our line of sight .",
    "3 .   using current observations we calculated the mass - loss rate from dwarf spheroidal satellites and globular clusters and found that both systems will undergo significant evolution in the next hubble time .",
    "future observations should be able to place much stronger limits on these destruction rates .",
    "mass - loss estimate together with measurements of the local and global pdmfs of a cluster can place limits on its imf .",
    "our review of the literature suggests that it is currently observationally feasible to carry out this program .",
