    "numerical simulations have shown that the very first stars invariably formed in isolation and were much more massive than the sun , due mainly to the inability of primordial gas to efficiently cool at low temperatures @xcite . @xcite",
    "have suggested that the pop iii imf was not dominated by very massive stars ( m @xmath10 140 m@xmath1 ) , but instead by stars with m = 840 m@xmath1 .",
    "even this imf , though , is still remarkably distinct from that observed for the local universe , which peaks at less than one solar mass @xcite .",
    "the deaths of the first stars produced and distributed copious amounts of metals into their surroundings , through either core - collapse ( m @xmath11 10 m@xmath1 ) or pair - instability ( m @xmath11 140 m@xmath1 ) supernovae @xcite .",
    "these metals provide additional avenues for radiative cooling of the ambient gas , through fine - structure and molecular transitions , as well as continuum emission from dust formed from the supernova ejecta , permitting the gas that will form the next generation of stars to reach temperatures lower than what is possible for metal - free gas .",
    "fragmentation of collapsing gas will continue so long as the gas can keep decreasing in temperature as the density increases @xcite , or until the gas becomes optically thick to its own emission @xcite .",
    "the minimum fragment mass is determined by the local jeans mass , @xmath12 where t , n , and @xmath13 are the temperature , number density , and mean molecular weight , at the halt of fragmentation @xcite . for metal - free gas , a minimum temperature of @xmath6 200 k",
    "is reached at n @xmath14 10@xmath15 cm@xmath0 when h@xmath17 cooling becomes inefficient , yielding a jeans mass , m@xmath18 @xmath14 10@xmath19 m@xmath1 @xcite . at some certain chemical abundance , it is conjectured that metals provide sufficient cooling , so that the temperature of the gas continues to decrease as the density increases past the stalling point for metal - free gas , allowing the collapsing gas - cloud to undergo fragmentation and form smaller and smaller clumps .",
    "the enrichment of gas to some critical metallicity , z@xmath20 , will trigger the formation of the first low - mass ( pop ii ) stars in the universe , as the gas can cool to lower temperatures at higher metallicity , in general .",
    "the value of z@xmath20 can be estimated by calculating the metallicity required to produce a cooling rate equal to the rate of adiabatic compression heating at a given temperature and density .",
    "this has been carried out for individual alpha elements , such as c and o , by @xcite , and c , o , si , fe , as well as solar abundance patterns by @xcite , yielding roughly , 10@xmath21 z@xmath1 @xmath22",
    "z@xmath20 @xmath22 10@xmath0 z@xmath1 .    aside from the minimum clump mass , however , not much more can be said about the spectrum of clump masses produced during fragmentation .",
    "@xcite use one - zone models with very sophisticated chemical networks to follow the evolution of temperature and density in the center of a collapsing gas cloud , for a range of metallicities .",
    "the predictions of fragmentation from this work , though , are based solely on statistical arguments of elongation in prestellar cores and do not capture the complex processes of interaction and accretion associated with the formation of multiple stars @xcite .",
    "@xcite simulate the high density ( n @xmath9 10@xmath23 cm@xmath0 ) evolution of extremely low - metallicity gas ( z @xmath24 10@xmath7 z@xmath1 ) , but the conclusions of this work are limited by the fact that the simulations are initialized at an extremely late phase in the evolution of the prestellar core . the numerical simulations by @xcite , which use cosmological initial conditions , show fragmentation in gas with z = 10@xmath0 z@xmath1 , but a mass resolution of 100 m@xmath1 prevents this study from saying anything conclusive about the formation of sub - stellar mass objects .    in this paper , we present the results of three - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of metal - enriched star - formation .",
    "these simulations are similar in nature to those of @xcite , but with vastly improved numerical methods and updated physics .",
    "we describe the setup of our simulations in  [ sec : setup ] , with the results in  [ sec : results ] and a discussion of the consequences of this work in  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we perform a series of four simulations , with constant metallicities , z = 0 ( metal - free ) , 10@xmath7 z@xmath1 , 10@xmath0 z@xmath1 , and 10@xmath3 z@xmath1 , using the eulerian adaptive mesh refinement hydrodynamics / n - body code , enzo @xcite .",
    "the metallicity is held constant throughout each simulation in order to isolate the role of heavy element concentration in altering the dynamics of collapse compared to the identical metal - free case . in reality",
    ", metals will be injected over time into star forming gas by pop iii supernova blast waves , and the mixing of those metals with the gas will not be completely uniform . here",
    "we focus on an idealized approximation in order to capture the essential physics of collapse and fragmentation .",
    "each simulation begins at z = 99 , in a cube , 300 h@xmath8 kpc comoving per side , in a @xmath2cdm universe , with the following cosmological parameters : @xmath25 = 0.3 , @xmath26 = 0.7 , @xmath27 = 0.04 , and hubble constant , h = 0.7 , in units of 100 km s@xmath8 mpc@xmath8 .",
    "we initialize all the simulations identically , with a power spectrum of density fluctuations given by @xcite , with @xmath28 = 0.9 and n = 1 .",
    "the computation box consists of a top grid , with 128@xmath19 cells , and three static subgrids , refining by a factor of 2 each .",
    "this gives the central refined region , which is 1/64 the total computational volume , an effective top grid resolution of 1024@xmath19 cells .",
    "the grid is centered on the location of a @xmath6 5 @xmath4 10@xmath5 m@xmath1 dark matter halo that is observed to form at z @xmath6 18 in a prior dark - matter - only simulation , as is done similarly in @xcite .",
    "refinement occurs during the simulations whenever the gas , or dark matter , density is greater than the mean density by a factor of 4 , or 8 , respectively .",
    "we also require that the local jeans length be resolved by at least 16 grid cells at all times in order to avoid artificial fragmentation as prescribed by @xcite .    to include the radiative cooling processes from the heavy elements , we use the method described in smith , sigurdsson , & abel ( 2007 ) , in preparation . the nonequilibrium abundances and cooling rates of h , h@xmath29 , h@xmath30 , he , he@xmath29 , he@xmath31 , h@xmath17 , h@xmath32 , and e@xmath30 are calculated internally , as in @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the metal cooling rates are interpolated from large grids of values , precomputed with the photoionization software , cloudy @xcite .",
    "we ignore the cooling from dust and focus only on the contribution of gas - phase metals in the optically - thin limit .",
    "unlike other studies of the formation of the first metal - enriched structures , we do not assume the presence of an ionizing uv background .",
    "in our model , the singular pop iii star that was associated with the dark matter halo in which our stars form has already died in a supernova .",
    "we also assume any other pop iii stars are too distant to affect the local star - forming region and that qsos have yet to form .",
    "we use the ` coronoal equilibrium ` command when constructing the cooling data in cloudy to simulate a gas where all ionization is collisional .",
    "the metal cooling data was created using the linux cluster , lion - xo , run by the high performance computing group at the pennsylvania state university . as a consequence of our choice to ignore any external radiation ,",
    "we do not observe the fine - structure emission of [ c ii ] ( 157.74 @xmath13 m ) that was reported by @xcite to be important .",
    "instead , cooling from c comes in the form of fine - structure lines of [ c i ] ( 369.7 @xmath13 m , 609.2 @xmath13 m ) .",
    "the cooling from [ c i ] in our study dominates in the same range of densities and temperatures as the cooling from [ c ii ] in @xcite .",
    "we observe the contributions of the other coolants studied by @xcite , [ o i ] , [ si ii ] , and [ fe ii ] , to be in agreement with their work .",
    "in addition , we find that emission from [ s i ] ( 25.19 @xmath13 m ) dominates the cooling from metals at n @xmath6 10@xmath33 cm@xmath0 and t @xmath6 13 @xmath4 10@xmath19 k. the absence of uv radiation in our simulations also allows h@xmath17 to form , differentiating this study from @xcite .",
    "this allows for a more direct comparison between the metal - free and metal - enriched cases .",
    "the simulations are run until one or more dense cores form at the center of the dark matter halo and a maximum refinement level of 28 is reached for the first time , giving us a dynamic range of greater than 10@xmath23 .",
    "only the simulation with z = 10@xmath3 z@xmath1 reached 28 levels of refinement .",
    "the three other simulations were stopped after reaching 27 refinement levels , since their central densities were already higher than the simulation with z = 10@xmath3 z@xmath1 .",
    "table 1 summarizes the final state of each simulation , where z@xmath34 is the collapse redshift , l@xmath35 is the highest level of refinement , @xmath36 is the maximum gas density within the box , and @xmath37t@xmath34 is the time difference to collapse from the metal - free simulation .",
    "as can be seen in table 1 , the runs with higher metallicities reach the runaway collapse phase faster .",
    "the relationship between metallicity relative to solar and @xmath37t@xmath34 is well fit by a power - law with index , n @xmath14 0.22 .",
    "gas - clouds with more metals are able to radiate away their thermal energy more quickly , and thus , collapse faster .",
    "an inverse relation between metallicity and the number of grids and grid - cells exists because the low - density , background gas evolves at roughly the same rate in all simulations , yet has more time , in the runs with lower metallicities , with which to collapse to higher density , requiring additional refinement .    our simulations , shown in figure 1 , display a qualitative transition in behavior between metallicities of 10@xmath7 z@xmath1 and 10@xmath0 z@xmath1 .",
    "in the runs with the highest metallicities ( figure 1c and 1d ) , the central core is extremely asymmetric , and multiple density maxima are clearly visible .",
    "all four runs display similar large - scale density profiles ( figure 2a ) .",
    "radiative cooling from h@xmath17 becomes extremely inefficient below t @xmath6 200 k , creating the effective temperature floor , visible in figure 2b for the metal - free case @xcite . at n @xmath14 10@xmath15 cm@xmath0 ,",
    "the rotational levels of h@xmath17 are populated according to lte , reducing the cooling efficiency and causing the temperature to increase @xcite . in the isothermal collapse model of @xcite ,",
    "the accretion rate is proportional to the cube of the sound speed .",
    "the increase in temperature leads to an increase in the accretion rate , causing the density , and thus , the enclosed mass ( figure 2c ) , to be slightly higher inside the central @xmath6 0.1 pc in the metal - free case .",
    "a similar situation occurs further within for the z = 10@xmath7 z@xmath1 and , later , the 10@xmath0 z@xmath1 cases , as the metal cooling is overwhelmed by adiabatic compression heating and the temperature begins to rise with density .",
    "the presence of metals at the level of 10@xmath7 z@xmath1 enhances the cooling enough to lower the gas temperature to @xmath6 75 k. metallicities greater than 10@xmath0 z@xmath1 provide sufficient cooling to bring the gas down to the temperature of the cosmic microwave background , where t@xmath38 @xmath14 2.7 k ( 1 + z ) .",
    "the gas temperatures are in general agreement with the calculations of @xcite that include a cmb spectrum at z = 20 .",
    "fragmentation requires that the cooling time be less than the dynamical time .",
    "figure 2d shows that this criterion is essentially never met in the zero metallicity case , and only marginally in the z = 10@xmath7 z@xmath1 case .",
    "however , the fragmentation criterion is more than satisfied in the z = 10@xmath0 z@xmath1 and 10@xmath3 z@xmath1 cases over a wide mass - range .    in order to locate fragments within our simulations",
    ", we employ an algorithm , based on @xcite , that works by identifying isolated density countours . before we search for clumps , we smooth the density field by assigning each grid - cell the mass - weighted mean density of the group of cells including itself and its neighbors within one cell - width .",
    "this serves to eliminate small density perturbations that would be misidentified as clumps by the code .",
    "in order to directly compare the fragmentation from each simulation , we limit the search for clumps to the 1 m@xmath1 of gas surrounding the cell with the highest density . on larger scales ,",
    "all of the runs display a filamentary structure that is qualitatively similar .",
    "no other region in any of the simulation boxes has collapsed to densities comparable to those found within the region where the clump search is performed .",
    "the results are shown in figure 3 .",
    "a single clump exists in the metal - free and 10@xmath7 z@xmath1 simulations , containing 99.7% of the total mass within the region of interest . in the simulation with z",
    "= 10@xmath0 z@xmath1 , 91% of the mass is shared between two clumps with 0.52 m@xmath1 and 0.39 m@xmath1 . in the same simulation",
    ", we also find two smaller clumps 0.06 m@xmath1 and 0.02 m@xmath1 . finally , in the z",
    "= 10@xmath3 z@xmath1 simulation , we see two clumps with 0.79 m@xmath1 and 0.21 m@xmath1 .",
    "we have shown , through three - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations , that fragmentation occurs in collapsing gas with metallicities , z @xmath9 10@xmath0 z@xmath1 .",
    "our results indicate that star - formation occurs in exactly the same manner at metallicity , z = 10@xmath7 z@xmath1 , as it does at zero metallicity .",
    "the similarities between the simulations with metallicities , z = 10@xmath0 z@xmath1 and 10@xmath3 z@xmath1 , suggest that the transition to low - mass star - formation is complete by 10@xmath0 z@xmath1 , implying that the entire transition occurs over only one order of magnitude in metal abundance",
    ". more simulations , bracketing the metallicity range , 10@xmath7 to 10@xmath0 z@xmath1 , will test how abrupt the transition truly is .",
    "we will also explore the effect of non - solar abundances on the low metallicity imf .",
    "it has been recently argued that dust cooling at high densities ( n @xmath9 10@xmath39 cm@xmath0 ) can induce fragmentation for metallicities as low as 10@xmath40 z@xmath1 @xcite . in light of the work by @xcite , who note the absence of stars with d@xmath41 @xmath24 -3.5 , where d@xmath41 is a measure of the combined logarithmic abundance of c and o , it seems unlikely that z@xmath20 is this low . while the fragmentation mode discussed in @xcite , and also @xcite ,",
    "may truly exist , it is possible that metal yields from pop iii supernovae overshoot this metallicity , for realistic mixing scenarios , leaving almost no star - forming regions with such a low concentration of heavy elements .",
    "similar to our results , @xcite note that only high - mass fragments are produced when z = 10@xmath7 z@xmath1 .",
    "if pop iii supernovae are able to immediately enrich the local universe to z = 10@xmath7 z@xmath1 , the high - density dust cooling fragmentation mode would be skipped altogether , and the high - mass stars that formed via the mode observed at 10@xmath7 z@xmath1 would leave no record in the search for low - metallicity stars in the local universe .",
    "we have limited the search for fragments to the dense 1 m@xmath1 core at the center of each simulation . within this region ,",
    "it is unlikely that any more fragments will form in any of the simulations . in all of the cases",
    "presented , the cooling has begun to be overwhelmed by compression heating such that the central temperature is now increasing with increasing density , which was indicated by @xcite to be the end of hierarchical fragmentation .",
    "fragmentation may continue in the surrounding lower density gas in the cases of z = 10@xmath0 z@xmath1 and 10@xmath3 z@xmath1 .",
    "the final stellar masses of these objects will also be affected interaction and accretion that will occur in later stages of evolution .",
    "in the two lowest metallicity cases , the gas immediately surrounding the central core evolves slowly enough that it will not have sufficient time to reach high densities before the uv radiation from the central , massive star dissociates all of the h@xmath17 . as was shown by @xcite , clouds with metallicities , z @xmath42 10@xmath7 z@xmath1 are unable to collapse without the aid of h@xmath17 cooling .    in the two simulations in which significant fragmentation is observed , z = 10@xmath0 and 10@xmath3 z@xmath1",
    ", the gas is able to cool rapidly to the temperature of the cmb .",
    "@xcite predict that the rate of pop iii supernovae peaks at a redshift , z @xmath6 20 , and then drops off sharply , implying that metal production from pop iii stars is effectively finished at this point . in this epoch , the characteristic mass - scale for metal - enriched star formation will be regulated by the cmb , as is predicted in @xcite .",
    "thus , the first pop ii stars will be considerably more massive , on average , than stars observed today , as was suggested by @xcite .",
    "observations of low - mass prestellar cores in the local universe reveal them to have temperatures of about 8.5 k , implying that the imf may not become completely normal until z @xmath24 3 when the cmb fell below this temperature .",
