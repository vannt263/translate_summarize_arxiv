    "<S> the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the energy - momentum tensor for a massive fermionic field is investigated in a ( 2 + 1)-dimensional conical spacetime in the presence of a circular boundary and an infinitely thin magnetic flux located at the cone apex . </S>",
    "<S> the mit bag boundary condition is assumed on the circle . at the cone apex </S>",
    "<S> we consider a special case of boundary conditions for irregular modes , when the mit bag boundary condition is imposed at a finite radius , which is then taken to zero . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of the magnetic flux leads to the aharonov - bohm - like effect on the vev of the energy - momentum tensor . </S>",
    "<S> for both exterior and interior regions , the vev is decomposed into boundary - free and boundary - induced parts . </S>",
    "<S> both these parts are even periodic functions of the magnetic flux with the period equal to the flux quantum . the boundary - free part in the radial stress is equal to the energy density . near the circle , the boundary - induced part in the vev dominates and for a massless field </S>",
    "<S> the vacuum energy density is negative inside the circle and positive in the exterior region . </S>",
    "<S> various special cases are considered .    </S>",
