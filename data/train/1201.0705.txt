    "tumor malignancy arises from many complex interactions occurring between the tumor and its host microenvironment .",
    "@xcite there is increasing evidence that the host microenvironment can significantly affect neoplasm progression .",
    "@xcite the growth of a confined solid tumor also produces mechanical pressure , leading to deformation of the surrounding microenvironment , which generally affects the growth dynamics of the tumor .",
    "@xcite such pressure can result in clinical complications , especially in a confined region of space such as the brain @xcite and deform or even collapse the intra - tumoral blood and lymphatic vessels.@xcite it has been hypothesized that pressure may also influence tumor physiology , growth rate and morphology .",
    "@xcite therefore , understanding effects of pressure on tumor growth is important for both fundamental cancer research and clinical practice .",
    "@xcite    mechanical interactions between a tumor and its microenvironment is a topic of great interest . in the work of helmlinger",
    "et al , @xcite it was shown that pressure can significantly reduce tumor growth rate and even inhibit tumor growth _ in vivo_. bru and casero @xcite studied the effect of external pressure on the growth of tumor cell colonies and showed that tumor morphology strongly depends on the pressure exerted by the surrounding medium .",
    "moreover , it has been observed that stiffer microenvironments can promote malignant behavior.@xcite for example , tumors embedded in low - density soft agarose gels remain roughly spherical in shape ; however , they could exhibit a finger - like morphology in a stiff gel with high density .",
    "@xcite    a variety of analytical and computational models have been developed to incorporate the effect of pressure on tumor growth .",
    "in particular , mcelwain and pettet @xcite considered that tumor cells mechanically behave as incompressible `` bags '' of fluid enclosed by the plasma membrane .",
    "chen et al .",
    "@xcite modeled the growth of tumor spheroids in agarose gels , considering the agarose gel to be a elastic material undergoing large deformations and the tumor tissue was approximated by a fluid - like material with additional drag and surface tension effects .",
    "roose et al .",
    "@xcite employed a linear poroelasticity model to estimate the solid stress generated by the growth of the tumor spheroid . although the overall growth of the tumor spheroid can be well described by these analytical approaches , they are not able to provide detailed information on the tumor morphology .",
    "gevertz et al .",
    "@xcite employed a cellular automaton model to investigate the effects the shape of an organ on growing tumors through mechanical interactions . using coupled nonlinear partial differential equations , macklin and lowengrub @xcite modeled the response of the tissue surrounding the tumor to the proliferation - induced mechanical pressure .",
    "specifically , these authors found that tumors growing in mechanically unresponsive ( i.e. , rigid ) microenvironments develop invasive fingering morphologies and tumors growing in mechanically responsive ( i.e. , soft ) microenvironment develop compact morphologies .",
    "however , since a continuum method is used , it is not possible to keep track of individual invasive cells that detach themselves from the primary tumor and how such invasive cells affect the growth dynamics and morphologies of the primary tumor .",
    "recently , we presented a single - cell based cellular automaton ( ca ) model for invasive tumor growth in heterogeneous microenvironments @xcite in response to the challenge of developing an `` ising '' model for cancer growth .",
    "@xcite in this ca model , individual invasive cells can detach themselves from the primary tumor , locally degrade the extracellular matrix ( ecm ) and invade into the surrounding host microenvironment . a rich spectrum of emergent properties and coupled growth dynamics of the primary tumor and invasive cells",
    "were predicted .",
    "however , the effects of pressure exerted by the outer boundary of the growth permitting region ( e.g. , cranium ) on the tumor and the deformation of the ecm were only implicitly considered . in this paper",
    ", we generalize the aforementioned ca model to explicitly take into account the deformation of the ecm surrounding an invasive or noninvasive tumor , which in turn imposes pressure on the neoplasm .",
    "moreover , we also explicitly consider the local geometry of the tumor - host interface ( i.e. , the tumor surface ) , which can either enhance or reduce local growth ( i.e. , interface instability ) depending on the local curvature of the interface . both _",
    "noninvasive - proliferative _ growth and _ invasive _ growth with individual cells that detach themselves from the primary tumor and migrate into the surrounding microenvironment are investigated .",
    "we show here that by varying the ecm rigidity ( density ) , one can obtain a continuous spectrum of tumor morphologies ranging from smooth isotropic shapes to fingering patterns , which have been observed both _ in vitro _ and _ in vivo _ @xcite .",
    "the specific surface @xcite is employed to quantify the degree of `` fingering '' for noninvasive proliferative growth .",
    "we find that both the high pressure built up due to tumor growth and the microenvironment heterogeneity can significantly promote malignancy of the noninvasive proliferative tumor .",
    "moreover , we show that individual invasive cells that leave an invasive primary tumor degrade the local ecm at the tumor - host interface , which diminishes the fingering growth of the primary tumor .",
    "our results concerning the diversity of tumor morphologies enable one to infer what are the possible mechanisms behind the resulting shapes .",
    "such information is expected to be of great value for cancer diagnosis , prognosis and therapy .",
    "following refs .  [ ] , we use the voronoi tessellation associated with random - sequential - addition ( rsa ) sphere packings @xcite to model the underlying cellular structure .",
    "in particular , nonoverlapping @xmath0-dimensional spheres ( @xmath1 and 3 ) are randomly and sequentially placed in a prescribed region in @xmath0-dimensional euclidean space until there is no void space left for additional spheres .",
    "then , space is divided into polyhedra , each associated with a sphere center , such that any points within a polyhedron is closer to its associated sphere center than to any other sphere centers .",
    "the resulting voronoi polyhedra are referred to as automaton cells , which can represent either real biological cells or regions of tumor stroma .",
    "here we explicitly takes into account the interactions between a single cell and the surrounding microenvironment .",
    "thus , each automaton cell represents either a _ single _ tumor cell ( approximately @xmath2 m in size ) or a region of tumor stroma of similar size . in the current model",
    ", we mainly focus on the effects of the ecm macromolecule density , ecm degradation by the malignant cells , and the pressure due to the ecm deformation on tumor growth .",
    "henceforth , we will refer to the host microenvironment ( or tumor stroma ) as the `` ecm '' for simplicity .",
    "each ecm associated automaton cell is assigned a particular density @xmath3 , representing the density of the ecm molecules within the automaton cell .",
    "a tumor cell can occupy an ecm associated automaton cell only if the density of this automaton cell @xmath4 , which means that either the ecm is degraded or it is deformed ( pushed away ) by the proliferating tumor cells .",
    "the extracellular matrix is a complex mixture of macromolecules and interstitial fluids that provides mechanical supports for the tissue and plays an important role for cell adhesion and motility .",
    "@xcite in general , the ecm can be highly heterogeneous , with large spatial variations of the ecm macromolecule densities @xmath5 .",
    "our simulated tumors are only allowed to grow in a compact growth - permitting region in order to mimic the physical confinement of the host microenvironment , such as the boundary of an organ or cranium in the case of the brain .",
    "therefore , a growing tumor deforms the ecm , which in turn imposes a pressure on the tumor .",
    "@xcite    in ref .  , we considered the effects of the local ecm density on the proliferating cells . in this work ,",
    "the ecm with larger density was considered to be more rigid and more difficult to degrade / deform .",
    "therefore , the probability of division @xmath6 , which is related to the cell doubling time @xmath7 by @xmath8 , was taken to be a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath3 , e.g. , @xmath9 the effect of pressure was only considered implicitly , e.g. , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the distance of the dividing cell from the tumor centroid , @xmath12 is the distance between the closest growth - permitting boundary cell in the direction of tumor growth and the tumor centroid .",
    "here we explicitly consider the pressure exerted on the growing tumor by the ecm due to deformation .",
    "in particular , we consider that the ecm is a linear elastic medium with bulk modulus @xmath13 .",
    "the pressure @xmath14 due to volume deformation @xmath15 is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the initial volume of the ecm .",
    "the ecm density @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the ecm mass .",
    "therefore , the ecm density increase due to small volume shrinkage , i.e. , @xmath20 which gives @xmath21 substituting eq .",

    "( [ eq_pressure ] ) , we have @xmath22 in other words , the pressure exerted by the ecm due to deformation is proportional to its density , i.e. , @xmath23 . without loss of generality , we consider that cell division probability is simply a monotonically decreasing function of pressure , and thus , also a monotonically decreasing function of the ecm density , i.e. , @xmath24 = [ 1 - \\frac{\\omega^*}{\\rho^0_{\\mbox{\\tiny{ecm } } } } ( \\rho_{\\mbox{\\tiny{ecm}}}-\\rho^0_{\\mbox{\\tiny{ecm}}})],\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is a constant of proportionality .",
    "suppose that the proliferative cells possess the ecm degradation ability @xmath26 , which is the fraction of the ecm macromolecules degraded by malignant cells per day per unit volume .",
    "after each day , the total mass of the ecm that has been degraded is @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the total number of the ecm associated automaton cells taken by new tumor cells , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are respectively the macromolecule density and volume associated with the @xmath31th automaton cell .",
    "the average ecm density is then given by @xmath32 we define the ratio of @xmath33 to be @xmath34 , i.e. , @xmath35 the macromolecule densities of the remaining ecm automaton cells are then updated as @xmath36 i.e. , the increase of the ecm density after deformation is proportional to its original density .",

    "real tumors never possess a perfect spherical shape .",
    "tumors growing even in a homogeneous soft ecm will develop a `` bumpy '' tumor surface , which can be very well captured by our underlying cellular structure model ( i.e. , the voronoi tessellation ) .",
    "@xcite when growing in a rigid microenvironment , a locally smooth tumor surface which results in a huge pressure gradient at the surface is highly undesirable .",
    "on the other hand , locally small protrusions on the tumor surface can gain some growth advantage by further invading into the surrounding ecm to release local pressure . @xcite    to model the aforementioned effects , we consider the local geometry of the protrusion tip . in particular , the width of the tip is taken to be the length @xmath40 of the automaton cell at the tip .",
    "the length of the tip is given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the position of the center of the automaton cell at the tip and @xmath43 is the average center position of tumor cells neighboring the cell at the tip .",
    "the growth advantage of the cell at the tip is then proportional to @xmath44 , i.e. , @xmath45 we note that @xmath46 is effective the radius of curvature , which can be either positive or negative .",
    "a negative value of @xmath46 reduces @xmath6 . for positive @xmath46 , the ratio @xmath44 is defined as the stress concentration factor associated with a crack tip in solid mechanics .",
    "other biophysical mechanisms associated with noninvasive and invasive malignant cells are the same as those described in ref .  .",
    "for example , the non - invasive cells remain in the primary tumor and can be proliferative , quiescent or necrotic , depending on their nutritional supply , which is determined by tumor - size dependent characteristic diffusion distances .",
    "proliferative cells can produce `` mutant '' daughter cells that possess strong ecm degradation ability @xmath47 and can leave the primary tumor and invade into the surrounding microenvironment by locally degrading the ecm macromolecules .",
    "readers are referred to ref .   for details of such mechanisms .",
    "we now specify the ca rules for our generalized model , which closely follow those given in ref .  , except for the additional rules explicitly incorporating the pressure imposed by the ecm and the local host - tumor interface instability described here .",
    "after generating the automaton cells using voronoi tessellation , an ecm density @xmath48 is assigned to each automaton cell within the growth - permitting region , which represents the heterogeneous host microenvironment .",
    "then a tumor is introduced by designating any one or more of the automaton cells as proliferative cancer cells .",
    "time is then discretized into units that represent one real day . at each time step :    * each automaton cell is checked for type : invasive , proliferative , quiescent , necrotic or ecm associated .",
    "invasive cells degrade and migrate into the ecm surrounding the tumor .",
    "proliferative cells are actively dividing cancer cells , quiescent cancer cells are those that are alive , but do not have enough oxygen and nutrients to support cellular division and necrotic cells are dead cancer cells . * all tumorous necrotic cells are inert ( i.e. , they do not change type ) . *",
    "quiescent cells more than a certain distance @xmath49 from the tumor s edge are turned necrotic .",
    "the tumor s edge , which is assumed to be the source of oxygen and nutrients , consists of all ecm associated automaton cells that border the neoplasm .",
    "the critical distance @xmath49 for quiescent cells to turn necrotic is computed as follows : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a prescribed parameter ( see table [ tab_param ] ) , @xmath0 is the euclidean spatial dimension and @xmath52 is the distance between the geometric centroid @xmath42 of the tumor and the tumor edge cell that is closest to the quiescent cell under consideration .",
    "the position of the tumor centroid @xmath42 is given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the total number of noninvasive cells contained in the tumor , which is updated when a new noninvasive daughter cell is added to the tumor .",

    "however , the model is easily extended to three dimensions and the algorithmic details of the model are presented for any spatial dimension .",
    "homogeneous and random distributions of the ecm density @xcite are used to study the effects of microenvironment heterogeneity on the growing tumor .",
    "the random distribution of the ecm density , which henceforth is referred to as the `` random ecm '' for simplicity , is generated by assigning a random ecm density value between 0 and 1 to each ecm associated automaton cell .",

    "we note that although generally the nutrient / oxygen concentration field _ in vivo _ is more complicated , previous numerical studies that considered the exact evolution of nutrient / oxygen concentrations have shown a decay of the concentrations toward the tumor center .",

    "the specific surface @xmath76 for the noninvasive proliferative tumor , defined as the ratio of the total length of the perimeter of the primary tumor over its total area , @xcite is employed to quantify the degree of `` fingering '' of the growing tumor . for a perfectly circular shape with radius @xmath77 , the associated @xmath76",

    "the invasive tumor cells are green .",
    "we first investigate the effects of pressure on the growth of noninvasive proliferative tumors by setting the mutation rate to zero , i.e. , @xmath81 .",

    "the associated specific surface as a function of time is also shown .",
    "the ecm degradation ability value @xmath83 for the proliferative cells is used .",
    "it can be clearly seen that as the ecm density ( i.e. , pressure level ) varies , a variety of growth dynamics and tumor morphologies emerge . in particular",
    ", the tumor growing in the ecm with low density ( pressure ) ( @xmath84 ) develops an almost isotropic shape with small specific surface @xmath85 ( upper panel of fig .",
    "1 ) . as the ecm density ( pressure ) increases ( @xmath86 ) , the tumor begins to develop bumpy surface , but a well - defined `` spherical '' core can still be identified ( middle panel of fig .",
    "1 ) . for the high ecm density ( pressure ) @xmath87 ,",
    "finger - like protrusions emerge at early growing stages and no `` spherical '' core of significant size is found ( lower panel of fig .",
    "the associated specific surface @xmath85 monotonically increases as the tumor grows . since the elongated finger - like structures of proliferative cells can grow into the nutrient - rich microenvironment , necrotic regions within these `` fingers '' are very rare .",
    "we note that the overall size ( i.e. , distance between tumor center and the farthest cell on tumor edge ) of the tumors with distinct morphologies decrease as the ecm density and the associated pressure increase . nonetheless , the emergence of finger - like structures significantly release the local pressure built up at the smooth surface of the growing tumor and thus , the growth of such invasion fingers is favored .",
    "figure 2 shows the snapshots of noninvasive tumors ( e.g. , @xmath81 ) growing in the random ecm with average initial density @xmath88 and 0.65 , as well as the associated specific surface @xmath85 as a function of time .",
    "the ecm degradation ability value @xmath83 for the proliferative cells is used .",
    "similar effects of the ecm density ( i.e. , pressure level ) on the growth dynamics and tumor morphologies are observed , i.e. , increasing the ecm density ( pressure ) leads to a continuous variation of tumor morphology ranging from smooth isotropic shapes to significantly fingered patterns . since the heterogeneity of the ecm results in stronger local tumor surface roughness , the fingering effect is also stronger comparing with the corresponding homogeneous case with the same ecm density .",
    "in particular , the tumor growing in the ecm with @xmath89 develops sub - fingers on the primary fingers , which is mainly caused by the local ecm density fluctuations ( lower panel of fig .",
    "such fine morphological features can hardly be resolved by continuum simulation method .",
    "the stronger fingering of tumors growing in the random ecm also leads to larger overall extents of the tumors .",
    "figure 3 shows the snapshots of invasive tumors growing in a homogeneous ecm with initial density @xmath90 and 0.65 on day 120 .",
    "specifically , individual invasive cells can detach themselves from the primary tumor and migrate into the surrounding ecm .",
    "the following values of invasiveness parameters are used : mutation rate @xmath91 , ecm degradation ability value for the proliferative cells @xmath92 , ecm degradation ability value for the invasive cells @xmath93 , motility of the invasive cells @xmath94 , which corresponds to a high degree of malignancy .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "3 that the tumor growing in the low - density ecm ( e.g. , under low pressure ) ( @xmath84 ) develops relatively short invasive branches ( fig .",
    "3a ) , while the tumor growing in the high - density ecm ( e.g. , under high pressure ) ( @xmath95 ) possesses very long invasive branches ( fig .",
    "3c ) . also , we note that a large number of invasive cells are generated at the finger tips of the primary tumor , which in turns promotes the growth of the fingers . since the invasive cells degrade the ecm close to the tumor surface , the local pressure exerted on the tumor is reduced .",
    "thus , the degree of `` fingering '' in the invasive tumors is smaller than in the noninvasive ones .",
    "the invasive cells also enhance the growth of the primary tumor .",
    "moreover , it can be seen that high ecm density ( i.e. , high pressure exerted on the tumor ) enhances both fingering of the primary tumor and malignant behavior of invasive cells ( fig .",
    "we note that such invasion - tumor couplings have been extensively explored in ref .  .",
    "figure 4 shows the snapshots of invasive tumors growing in the random ecm with average initial density @xmath96 and 0.65 on day 120 .",
    "the same values of invasiveness parameters as the homogeneous case are used .",
    "again , the growth dynamics and tumor morphologies are qualitatively the same as the corresponding homogeneous case .",
    "however , the heterogeneity of the ecm enhances local tumor instability and thus , promotes the malignant behavior of the invasive tumor .",
    "we have generalized a recently developed cellular automaton model to study the effects of pressure on the dynamics and tumor morphologies for both noninvasive proliferative growth and invasive growth with individual malignant cells detaching themselves from the primary tumor .",
    "in particular , we have explicitly taken into account the deformation of the extracellular matrix surrounding the tumor , which in turn imposes pressure on the neoplasm .",
    "moreover , we also considered the local tumor - host interface instability , which can give rise to the emergence of finger - like protrusions of the tumor surface .",
    "we showed that by varying the ecm rigidity ( i.e. , the pressure level in the ecm ) , one can obtain a variety of tumor morphologies ranging from spherical shapes to fingering patterns , which are quantitatively characterized by the specific surface .",
    "we also found that both high pressure and microenvironment heterogeneity can amplify the malignancy of the neoplasm in both the noninvasive proliferative case and the invasive case .",
    "moreover , we demonstrated that the growth dynamics of the primary tumor and invasive cells are strongly coupled .",
    "figure 5 shows the morphology of ductal carcinoma _ in situ _ ( dcis ) , which resembles the morphology of noninvasive tumors growing in the ecm with intermediate density ( fig .",
    "1(b ) and fig .",
    "2(b ) ) predicted by our ca model .",
    "strong fingering growth is rarely observed for dcis , manly because the neoplasm is further constrained by a tight basal membrane composed of epithelial cells .",
    "such complex microenvironment heterogeneities need to be incorporated in the ca model to accurately predict dcis progression . on the other hand , significant",
    "fingering has been observed _ in vitro_.@xcite these experimental observations clearly demonstrate the robustness and predictive capability of our ca model .",
    "we have shown that a high pressure in the ecm , which is due to large ecm density and deformation , can lead to significant fingering growth and enhance the malignant behavior of both the primary tumor and invasive cells . as a tumor grows in a confined microenvironment",
    ", it is inevitable that a high pressure will be built up .",
    "thus , a tumor with a low level of malignancy initially can eventually develop highly malignant invasive behavior . specifically ,",
    "when finger - like protrusions develop , cells close to the finger tip have less contacting neighbors and thus , less adhesion .",
    "this makes it very easy for the invasive cells to leave the primary tumor and migrate deeply into the surrounding microenvironment , which ultimately leads to cancer metastasis .    moreover , our results concerning the diversity of tumor morphologies enable one to infer the possible mechanisms behind the resulting shapes .",
    "for example , a noninvasive proliferative tumor possesses a morphology with significant finger - like protrusions on the tumor surface could be attributed to a host microenvironment in which the tumor grew that was very rigid and inhomogeneous . on the other hand",
    ", if such a tumor has a smooth and almost isotropic shape , it could mean that its host environment was very soft and homogeneous .",
    "for an invasive tumor with individual invasive cells that detach themselves from the primary tumor and migrate into the surrounding microenvironment , a rougher tumor surface could imply that the individual invasive cells possessed a strong ecm degradation ability , high motility and weak cell - cell adhesion .",
    "although our ca model is readily applied to model _ in vitro",
    "_ tumor growth , the heterogeneous microenvironments considered in the current model are highly idealized and do not include heterogeneities such as blood vessels and lymphatics , which could play an important role in clinical cancers . incorporating more realistic microenvironments as well as other possible mechanisms ( e.g. , tumor and normal cell phenotypic plasticity and immune response ) would lead to an improved model that could provide insights into _ in vivo _ tumor growth .",
    "nonetheless , we expect that the conclusions drawn here still qualitatively apply to _ in vivo _ situations .",
    "therefore , information on the tumor morphology , which can be obtained from histological images , is expected to lead to more accurate diagnosis and thus , more effective tumor treatment strategies .",
    "for example , if a tumor with a rough surface is detected , drugs that can release the high concomitant pressure in the host environment by modifying the molecular compositions of the ecm macromolecules could be used to reduce the malignancy of the tumor , leading to a noninvasive smooth isotropic shape .",
    "this not only could improve the efficiency of chemotherapy but also could make it easier to remove the tumor by resection .",
    "finally , we note that improving the deliverability of chemotherapy will require application of existing theories to predict the transport properties of the underlying heterogeneous media.@xcite    the research described was supported by the national cancer institute under award no .",
