    "granular systems composed of a large number of dissipatively interacting particles behave in many respects as a continuous medium and may be , in principle , described by a set of hydrodynamic equations with appropriate boundary conditions . although this approach is successively used in various fields of engineering and soil mechanics ( e.g. @xcite ) a first - principle theory for dense granular media is still lacking .",
    "hydrodynamics may be also applied to much simpler systems , such as rarefied granular gases .",

    "the hydrodynamic equations are not postulated but derived from the boltzmann equation .",
    "the corresponding transport coefficients are not phenomenological constants , instead they are obtained by regular methods , such as the grad method @xcite or the chapman - enskog method @xcite . in most of the studies , which address the derivation of hydrodynamic equations and kinetic coefficients",
    ", it was assumed that the coefficient of restitution @xmath0 is a material constant , e.g. @xcite .",
    "this assumption simplifies the analysis enormously , however , it is neither in agreement with experimental observations ( e.g. @xcite ) nor with basic mechanics of particle collisions @xcite .",
    "the coefficient of restitution depends on the impact velocity @xmath1 and tends to unity for very small @xmath1 . as a consequence ,",
    "particles behave more and more elastically as the average velocity of the grains decreases .",
    "the simplest collision model which accounts for dissipative material deformation , is the model of viscoelastic particles .",
    "it is assumed in this model that the elastic stress in the bulk of the particle material depends linearly on the strain , whereas the dissipative stress depends linearly on the strain rate .",
    "based on the fundamental work by hertz @xcite the interaction force between colliding viscoelastic spheres has been derived @xcite . using this generalized hertz law the coefficient of restitution of viscoelastic particles",
    "can be given as a function of the impact velocity and material parameters @xcite : @xmath2 with @xmath3 the unit vector @xmath4 specifies the collision geometry , i.e. , the relative position @xmath5 of the particles at the collision instant .",
    "their pre - collision velocities are given by @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the elastic constant @xmath8 depends on the effective mass and radius @xmath9 , @xmath10 of the colliding spheres , on the young modulus @xmath11 , and on the poisson ratio @xmath12 of the particle material .",
    "the dissipative coefficient @xmath13 is a function of dissipative and elastic constants ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "finally , @xmath14 is a numerical constant @xcite : @xmath15 equation describes pure viscoelastic interaction .",
    "the assumption of viscoelastic deformation is justified if the impact velocity is not too large to avoid plastic deformation of the particles and not too small to neglect surface effects such as adhesion , van der waals forces etc .",
    "we also assume that the rotational degrees of freedom of particles may be neglected and consider a granular gas of identical particles in the absence of external forces .",
    "then the coefficient of restitution gives the velocities of particles after a collision @xmath16 , @xmath17 in terms of their values before the collision : @xmath18    the impact velocity dependence of the coefficient of restitution implies serious consequences for the granular gas dynamics : for the simplified case @xmath19 the form of the velocity distribution function @xmath20 is characterized by a time - independent scaled function @xmath21 .",

    ", however , the effective value of @xmath0 changes with time along with the thermal velocity @xmath25 , which gives a typical velocity of the particles . therefore , the shape of the velocity distribution function evolves in a rather complicated way @xcite .",
    "the time dependence of the velocity distribution function has to be taken into account when the hydrodynamic equations and the transport coefficients are derived .",
    "since the simple scaling is violated , the standard methods of kinetic theory of gases , developed for @xmath19 ( e.g. @xcite ) must be revised .    as it follows from our analysis",
    "the transport coefficients for gases of viscoelastic particles depend on temperature and time rather differently as compared with the case @xmath26 correspondingly , the behavior of gases of viscoelastic particles differs qualitatively from that of gases of particles with the simplified collision model @xmath19    we wish to remark that the impact velocity dependence of @xmath0 has been already taken into account in ref .",

    "therefore the coefficient @xmath59 ( and hence the form of the velocity distribution function ) evolves in accordance with temperature .    for the hydrodynamic description of granular gases",
    "we assume that there exist well separated time and length scales . the short time and",
    "length scales are given by the mean collision time and the mean free path , and the long time and length scales are characterized by the evolution of the hydrodynamic fields ( to be defined in the next section ) and their spatial inhomogeneities .",
    "the hydrodynamic approach corresponds to the coarse - grained description of the system , where all processes which take place on the short time and length scales are neglected .",
    "therefore the first stage of the relaxation of the velocity distribution function does not affect the hydrodynamic description and only the second stage of its evolution on the time scale @xmath93 is to be taken into account .",
    "to this end we apply an adiabatic approximation : we omit the term @xmath94 in the left - hand side of eq . which describes the fast relaxation and assume that @xmath59 is determined by the current values of @xmath65 and @xmath66 due to the present temperature .",
    "hence , in the adiabatic approximation @xmath59 is determined by @xmath95 using for @xmath65 , @xmath66 we find @xmath59 as an expansion in the small parameter @xmath72 : @xmath96 figures [ fig : a2shortwli ] and [ fig : a2longwli ] show @xmath59 in adiabatic approximation due to eq . together with the numerical solution of eqs .",

    "it is in agreement with the numerical result .",
    "this value of the dissipative parameter corresponds to the initial coefficient of restitution @xmath99 for the thermal velocity .",
    "the adiabatic approximation becomes more and more accurate as the system evolves .",
    "contrary , the linear theory fails with increasing @xmath90 and becomes qualitatively incorrect for larger @xmath90 . in figs .",
    "[ fig : a2shortwli ] and [ fig : a2longwli ] the evolution of the system has started from a maxwell distribution , i.e. , @xmath100 .",
    "[ fig : a2init ] shows the relaxation of @xmath59 from certain initial conditions @xmath101 which correspond to non - maxwellian distribution functions .",
    "the relaxation occurs during the first 5 - 10 collisions per particle .",
    "then the adiabatic approximation becomes valid even for intermediate values of the dissipative parameter @xmath90 .",
    "the adiabatic approximation yields very accurate results for the evolution of temperature .",
    "it coincides almost perfectly with the numerical solution for the short and for the long time scales and for all values of the dissipative parameter @xmath102 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : taiab ] ) .",
    "thus we conclude that the adiabatic approximation may be applied for the hydrodynamic description of granular gases .    by means of eq . for the second sonine coefficient we can determine the moments @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and the cooling coefficient @xmath103 : @xmath104 where @xmath105    below we will need the derivatives of @xmath59 and @xmath103 with respect to temperature and density . using @xmath106 according to the definition of of @xmath72 , eq .",
    ", we obtain @xmath107",
    "for the derivation of hydrodynamic equations from the boltzmann equation it is assumed that there exist well separated time and length scales . as already briefly discussed in the preceding section , in granular gases",
    "there are ( at least ) two sets of scales : the microscopic scales are characterized by the mean collision time and the mean free path .",
    "the macroscopic scales are given by the characteristic time of the evolution of the hydrodynamic fields and the size of their spatial inhomogeneities .",
    "hence , scale separation means that the macroscopic fields vary very slowly in space and time if measured in the microscopic units .",
    "this assumption allows for a gradient expansion in space and time , i.e. the application of the chapman - enskog method @xcite .",
    "the application of the chapman - enskog approach to granular gases is more sophisticated than its application to molecular gases : for molecular gases the unperturbed solution ( the basic solution ) for the velocity distribution function is the maxwell distribution while for granular gases the basic solution is the time - dependent velocity distribution of the homogeneous cooling state .    for gases of particles in the homogeneous cooling state , which collide with @xmath19 ,",
    "the velocity distribution function depends on time only through the time - dependent characteristic velocity .",
    "the shape of the velocity distribution function , given by @xmath43 , is fixed by @xmath0 and does not depend on time .",
    "hence the evolution of temperature describes the evolution of the velocity distribution function exhaustively . for granular gases of viscoelastic particles",
    "the shape of the velocity distribution function , characterized by the sonine coefficients @xmath108 , is time dependent due to the time dependence of these coefficients . in the previous section we exemplified this property for the first non - trivial coefficient @xmath109 , assuming that for small dissipation higher coefficients may be disregarded .",
    "therefore , the evolution of granular gases of viscoelastic particles is described by the time dependence of temperature , i.e. , by the second moment of the velocity distribution function , and by the time dependence of its higher - order even moments which are characterized by the sonine coefficients @xmath59 , @xmath110 , etc .",
    "[ see eq . ] .",
    "hence , the hydrodynamic description of granular gases whose particles collide with @xmath111 requires an extended set of hydrodynamic fields which includes the higher - order moments .",
    "a regular approach to derive hydrodynamic equations for this extended set of fields is the grad method @xcite .",
    "alternatively , for small dissipation an adiabatic approximation can be applied : it is assumed that the shape of the velocity distribution function , albeit varying in time , follows adiabatically the current temperature .",
    "correspondingly , the higher - order moments are determined by the temperature too . with this approximation a closed set of hydrodynamic equations for density @xmath112 , velocity @xmath113 , and temperature @xmath114",

    "we apply the chapman - enskog approach @xcite .",
    "this method is based on two important assumptions : the evolution of the distribution function is completely determined by the evolution of its first few moments , i.e. , it depends on space and time only through the hydrodynamic fields : @xmath133 \\ , .\\ ] ] as the second precondition it is assumed that the gas is only slightly inhomogeneous on the microscopic length scale which allows for a gradient expansion of the velocity distribution function : @xmath134 where each power @xmath135 of the formal parameter @xmath136 corresponds to the order @xmath135 in the spatial gradient .",
    "thus , @xmath137 refers to the homogeneous cooling state , @xmath138 corresponds to the linear approximation with respect to the fields gradients , @xmath139 is the solution with respect to quadratic terms in the field gradients , etc . with these assumptions",
    "the boltzmann equation may be solved iteratively for each order in @xmath136 , together with the hydrodynamic equations for the moments of the velocity distribution function .",
    "the solution in zeroth order in @xmath136 yields the velocity distribution function for the homogeneous cooling state @xmath137 and the corresponding evolution of temperature .",
