    "ever since the publication of @xcite s _ theory of games and economic behavior _ in 1944 , coalitions have played a central role within game theory .",
    "the crucial questions in coalitional game theory are which coalitions can be expected to form and how the members of coalitions should divide the proceeds of their cooperation . traditionally the focus has been on the latter issue , which led to the formulation and analysis of concepts such as the core , the shapley value , or the bargaining set . which coalitions are likely to form is commonly assumed to be settled exogenously , either by explicitly specifying the coalition structure , a partition of the players in disjoint coalitions , or , implicitly , by assuming that larger coalitions can invariably guarantee better outcomes to its members than smaller ones and that , as a consequence , the grand coalition of all players will eventually form .",
    "the two questions , however , are clearly interdependent : the individual players payoffs depend on the coalitions that form just as much as the formation of coalitions depends on how the payoffs are distributed .",
    "_ coalition formation games _ , as introduced by @xcite , provide a simple but versatile formal model that allows one to focus on coalition formation .",
    "in many situations it is natural to assume that a player s appreciation of a coalition structure only depends on the coalition he is a member of and not on how the remaining players are grouped .",
    "initiated by @xcite and @xcite , much of the work on coalition formation now concentrates on these so - called _",
    "hedonic games_. hedonic games are relevant in modeling many settings such as formation of groups , clubs and societies  @xcite and also online social networking  @xcite .",
    "the main focus in hedonic games has been on notions of stability for coalition structures such as _ nash stability _ , _ individual stability _ , _ contractual individual stability _ , or _",
    "core stability _ and characterizing conditions under which the set of stable partitions is guaranteed to be non - empty ( see , * ? ? ?",

    ", the most general stability concept that is guaranteed to exist . a well - studied special case of hedonic games are two - sided matching games in which only coalitions of size two are admissible  @xcite .",

    "hedonic games have recently been examined from an algorithmic perspective  ( see , * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite surveyed the algorithmic problems related to stable partitions in hedonic games in various representations .",
    "@xcite showed that for hedonic games represented by _ individually rational list of coalitions _ , the complexity of checking whether core stable , nash stable , or individual stable partitions exist is np - complete .",
    "he also proved that every hedonic game admits a contractually individually stable partition .",
    "coalition formation games have also received attention in the artificial intelligence community where the focus has generally been on computing optimal partitions for general coalition formation games  @xcite without any combinatorial structure .",
    "@xcite proposed a fully - expressive model to represent hedonic games which encapsulates well - known representations such as _ individually rational list of coalitions _ and _ additive separability_.    _ additively separable hedonic games ( ashgs ) _ constitute a particularly natural and succinctly representable class of hedonic games . each player in an ashg has a value for any other player and the value of a coalition to a particular player is simply the sum of the values he assigns to the members of his coalition .",
    "additive separability satisfies a number of desirable axiomatic properties  @xcite and ashgsare the non - transferable utility generalization of _ graph games _ studied by @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that checking whether a nontrivial nash stable partition exists in an ashgis np - complete if preferences are nonnegative and symmetric .",
    "this result was improved by @xcite who showed that checking whether a core stable , strict core stable , nash stable , or individually stable partition exists in a general ashgis np - hard . @xcite",
    "obtained positive algorithmic results for subclasses of ashgsin which each player merely divides other players into friends and enemies .",
    "@xcite examined the tradeoff between stability and social welfare in ashgs .",
    "recently , @xcite showed that computing partitions that satisfy some variants of individual - based stability is pls - complete , even for very restricted preferences .",
    "in another paper , @xcite studied the complexity of computing and verifying optimal partitions in ashgs .    in this paper",
    ", we settle the complexity of key problems regarding stable partitions of ashgs .",
    "we present a polynomial - time algorithm to compute a contractually individually stable partition .",
    "this is the first positive algorithmic result ( with respect to one of the standard stability concepts put forward by @xcite ) for general ashgswith no restrictions on the preferences .",
    "we strengthen recent results of @xcite and prove that checking whether the core or the strict core exists is np - hard , even if the preferences of the players are symmetric .",
    "finally , it is shown that verifying whether a partition is in the contractually strict core ( csc ) is conp - complete , even if the partition under question consists of the grand coalition .",
    "this is the first computational hardness result concerning csc stability in hedonic games of any representation .",
