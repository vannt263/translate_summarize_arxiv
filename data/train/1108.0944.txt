    "a generalization of the quantum yang - baxter equation for three dimensional models is the tetrahedron equation proposed by zamolodchikov @xcite .",
    "it is related @xcite to four dimensional consistency of the discrete darboux equations @xcite , or equivalently , to four dimensional compatibility of the geometric construction scheme of the quadrilateral lattice @xcite .",
    "it turns out @xcite that all presently known solutions of the quantum tetrahedron equation can be obtained , by a canonical quantization , from classical solutions of the functional tetrahedron equation derived from the quadrilateral lattices .",
    "recently it has been observed @xcite that the quadrilateral lattice theory can be considered as a part of the theory of the desargues maps , which describe in geometric terms hirota s discrete kadomtsev ",

    "there is a natural question what should replace zamolodchikov s tetrahedron equation in the transition from quadrilateral lattices do desargues maps .",
    "we demonstrate that the answer is provided by the pentagon equation .    to make presentation more transparent we start in section  [ sec : geom ] from the geometric essence of the construction based on elementary considerations on the veblen and desargues configurations @xcite and their symmetry groups .",
    "given five points of the veblen configuration we are ( almost ) uniquely given the last one , what we call the _ veblen flip_. the presence of five veblen configurations within the desargues configuration gives the pentagon property of the veblen flip . by parametrizing the veblen flip using homogeneous coordinates from a division ring @xmath1",

    "first , under appropriate choice of the gauge in the commutative case the veblen map leaves invariant a natural poisson structure .",
    "such a map preserves also the ultra - local weyl commutation relations which quantize that structure . from other point of view",
    "the procedure can be considered as integrable reduction of the generic division ring solution of the functional pentagon equation to a particular division algebra .",
    "this allows to rewrite the map as inner automorphism , and to obtain the corresponding solution of the dynamical quantum pentagon equation , which can be expressed using the quantum dilogarithm function .",

    "if we want to apply the veblen flip , starting from the initial configuration described above , it can be either the flip @xmath53 ( in the configuration labelled by the tetrahedron with vertices @xmath54 ) or the flip @xmath55 .",
    "after the first flip we have a similar choice of two flips , but we exclude that related to the veblen configuration just used ( in order not to go back immediately to the initial configuration )",
