    "large deviation theory @xcite is the branch of mathematics that deals with exponentially decaying probabilities .",
    "therefore , it is the appropriate mathematical theory for statistical physics . for example , two basic concepts in large deviation theory are that of a rate function ( or large deviation function ) , which gives the rate at which a certain probability distribution decays exponentially , and the scaled cumulant generating function , which is the legendre - fenchel transform of the rate function . in equilibrium statistical physics , the microcanonical entropy is a rate function and the canonical free energy is the corresponding scaled cumulant generating function .",
    "moreover , it can be shown that the maximum entropy and minimum free energy principles are consequences of the more general contraction principle , which is central in large deviation theory .",
    "furthermore , large deviation theory also plays a prominent role for systems out of equilibrium .",
    "a series of relations known as fluctuation relations @xcite are the most general statements known in nonequilibrium statistical physics , for which a general theoretical framework still lacks . among these relations are the jarzynski relation @xcite , the crooks relation @xcite , the hatano - sasa relation @xcite and the gallavotti - cohen - evans - morriss ( gcem ) fluctuation theorem @xcite .",
    "these statements are about very rare events , where a certain fluctuating entropy takes a negative value .",
    "therefore , they are appropriately described with the use of large deviation theory . in particular , here we focus on the gcem fluctuation theorem for markov pure jump processes .",
    "this relation is written as a symmetry in the large deviation function ( or the corresponding scaled cumulant generating function ) associated with the probability distribution of the fluctuating entropy and is also known as the gcem symmetry .",
    "more broadly , one can consider a class of functionals of a stochastic path known as time - integrated currents . whereas the entropy , which is a specific time - integrated current , has a symmetric large deviation function , in general other currents",
    "do not display this symmetry .",
    "the gcem symmetry has its roots on the fact that the entropy is a very special functional given by the logarithm of the weight of the path divided by the weight of the time - reversed path .",
    "hence , one question that arises is that if it is possible to find other currents with a symmetric large deviation function and what would be the physical origin of the symmetry .",
    "this problem has been recently addressed in @xcite where it was shown that for a restricted class of markov pure jump processes a current different from entropy presents a symmetric large deviation function . as examples ,",
    "it was shown in @xcite that besides the entropy , the height in a surface growth model ( see also @xcite ) and the mechanical work in a toy model for a molecular motor display such symmetry .",
    "more clearly , markov jump processes are used to describe a large amount of physical processes out of equilibrium and time - integrated currents are important physical observables .",
    "therefore , a more complete theory about symmetries of large deviation functions associated with time - integrated currents might be relevant for the theoretical understanding of nonequilibrium statistical physics .",
    "we pursue this direction in the present paper where we obtain a necessary condition in order to have the symmetry in a non - entropic current .",
    "this condition is phrased in terms of schnakenberg network theory @xcite , where the states of the markov process form a network , with the transition rates representing the edges and the states the vertices .",
    "we show that in order to have a symmetric current different from entropy , the current increments related to cycles in this network have to be degenerate .",
    "this result comes from an analysis of the characteristic polynomial of a modified markov generator @xcite .",
    "in addition , we consider explicitly a four - state system with three cycles .",
    "we show that in this case two other symmetries , different from the gcem symmetry , can be found ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "we also demonstrate that in a fully connected four - state system many other symmetries arise . as for the physical origin of the symmetries , following previous work @xcite",
    ", we show that they are also related to time - reversal . however , they come from the time - reversal of a group of trajectories , where the grouping depends on the specific current under consideration and is related to the degeneracies in the increments of the cycles .",
    "we note that links between schnakenberg network theory and fluctuation relations have been addressed previously in the literature @xcite .",
    "the main differences between these works and the present paper are : authors in @xcite study multidimensional joint distribution of currents while here we consider the probability distribution of a single non - entropic current ; we focus our study on elementary currents ( see section 3 ) while the work explained in @xcite concerns fluctuating currents associated with topological cycles ( kalpazidou @xcite provided a survey of the interconnection between topological cycles and edges ) .",
    "finally , the effect of the coarse graining procedure on the entropy production and its relation to schnakenberg network theory is analysed in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way . in the next section",
    "we define time - integrated currents and show how their scaled cumulant generating function can be obtained from a modified generator .",
    "in section 3 we introduce schnakenberg network theory , which is used in section 4 where we obtain the necessary condition .",
    "section 5 contains an analysis of the four - state system with three cycles . the new symmetry as a result of the time - reversal of a group of paths",
    "is discussed in section 6 .",
    "we conclude in section 7 .",
    "moreover , in the [ ab ] an extension of the kirchhoff s law in the large deviation regime , which is important for schnakenberg network theory , is presented and the four - state fully connected system is analyzed in [ aa ] .",
    "pure jump continuous time markov processes @xcite are defined by the transition rates between a pair of states . if we consider a pair of states @xmath0 , the probability per unit time of going from state @xmath1 to @xmath2 ( the transition rate ) is denoted by @xmath3 . in this paper",
    "we restrict to a finite set of states represented by @xmath4 .",
    "the probability of being in a state @xmath5 at time @xmath6 follows the master equation , which reads @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the escape rate from state @xmath1 .",
    "this equation is also normally written in the matrix form @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the markov generator .",
    "it is defined as @xmath11    the object we study here is the so - called time - integrated current ( or just current ) .",
    "this is a functional of the stochastic trajectory , which is a sequence of jumps @xmath12 , taking place at random times @xmath13 , within a fixed time interval @xmath14 $ ] , where @xmath15 is the fluctuating total number of jumps in the trajectory .",
    "more precisely , the stochastic trajectory starts at state @xmath16 at time @xmath17 and then jumps iteratively from state @xmath18 to state @xmath19 at time @xmath20 until it reaches a state @xmath21 , where it stays until at least @xmath22 .",

    "furthermore , a current is a functional such that this increment has the property of being antisymmetric , i.e. , @xmath27 .    since the current is a functional of the stochastic trajectory we can consider a probability distribution of currents in the following way . given a time interval @xmath28 the probability that the current ( [ cur ] ) takes the value @xmath29 is written as @xmath30}}\\mathbb{p}(x_{\\left[0,t\\right ] } ) \\delta(j_t[x_{\\left[0,t\\right]}]-at ) , \\label{probcurrent}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the time - averaged current , @xmath32})$ ] is the weight of the path @xmath23}$ ] and the sum represents an integral over all possible trajectories . in most of this paper",
    "we do not carry the explicit dependence of the current on the stochastic trajectory @xmath23}$ ] , writing only @xmath33 .",
    "the fluctuation theorem is a symmetry in the probability distribution of the entropy current @xmath34 , which is defined by the increment @xmath35 , i.e. , @xmath36}]=\\sum_{i=0}^{m-1}\\ln \\frac{w_{x(t_{i})\\to x(t_{i+1})}}{w_{x(t_{i+1})\\to x(t_{i})}}. \\label{curentropy}\\ ] ] we point out that we are considering processes such that if @xmath37 then @xmath38 , otherwise entropy can not be defined .",
    "this symmetry , known as the gcem symmetry , is valid in the limit of @xmath39 and is related to events in which the entropy current considerably deviates from its average .",
    "therefore , it is conveniently written in terms of the large deviation function @xmath40 , which is defined by @xmath41 where @xmath42 .",
    "explicitly , the gcem symmetry reads @xmath43 note that we are using the subscript @xmath44 to denote the large deviation function associated with entropy . for a general current of the form ( [ cur ] )",
    ", we denote the large deviation function by @xmath45 .    instead of the probability distribution of a current we can work with the associated generating function .",
    "particularly , the scaled - cumulant generating function related to @xmath46 is defined by @xmath47}}\\mathbb{p}(x_{\\left[0,t\\right]})\\exp\\left(zj_t[x_{\\left[0,t\\right]}]\\right),\\ ] ] it follows from the varadhan theorem @xcite that @xmath48 is the legendre - fenchel transform of @xmath45 , that is , @xmath49 therefore , the gcem symmetry can also be written as @xmath50 more generally , for any current proportional to @xmath51 in the large deviation regime we obtain the symmetry @xmath52 .",
    "moreover , it can be shown that @xmath48 is given by the maximum eigenvalue of a modified generator associated with the current @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "this modified generator is defined as @xmath53 note that this is not a stochastic matrix , but it is still a perron - frobenius matrix : it has a unique real maximum eigenvalue which gives @xmath48 .    in this paper",
    "we are interested in finding currents following the symmetry @xmath54 that are different from entropy in the limit of @xmath55 ( i.e. not proportional to @xmath56 ) .",
    "a sufficient condition for that is a fully symmetric spectrum of eigenvalues @xcite . in this case , the characteristic polynomial associated with @xmath57 , @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the identity matrix , follows the symmetry @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , our objective is to find currents different from entropy in the large deviation regime such that the characteristic polynomial of their associated modified generators is symmetric . as a general result in this direction , in section [ sec4 ] we obtain a necessary condition for a symmetric characteristic polynomial related to a non - entropic current . before going into that , in the next section",
    "we define elementary currents and introduce schnakenberg network theory , which are important in analyzing the determinant ( [ eq : det ] ) .",
    "we now consider the space of states @xmath4 as a graph where the vertices are the states and the edges represent the transition rates .",
    "therefore , if the transition rate between two states is zero there is no edge connecting these states .",
    "we denote this graph by @xmath61 .    given a pair of states @xmath0 , the elementary fluctuating current from @xmath1 to @xmath2 is written as @xmath62 . moreover ,",
    "an elementary current is such that @xmath63 ( which implies @xmath64 ) and the increment is zero for all other pairs of states in @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , the general current ( [ cur ] ) can be written as @xmath65    an important restriction on the number of independent elementary currents is the finite time kirchhoff s law @xcite , which reads @xmath66 this relation comes from the fact that , during a stochastic trajectory , when the system reaches the state @xmath1 , if there is a subsequent jump , the system will leave @xmath1 . defining @xmath67 , the above relation can be written as @xmath68 this formula is valid for any trajectory ( remember that @xmath69 is a functional of the trajectory @xmath23}$ ] ) and in the typical regime ( @xmath39 ) , it gives the usual kirchhoff s law .",
    "as we explain in [ ab ] it is also valid in the ( non typical ) large deviation regime , which is normally not appreciated in the literature ( see @xcite for a counter example ) .",
    "is @xmath70 , while the one related to the chord @xmath71 is @xmath72.,width=377 ]    let us now introduce schnakenberg network theory @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "first we introduce the concepts of cycle , fundamental cycle , spanning tree , and chord .",
    "a cycle in the network @xmath61 is a closed path ( or loop ) : this is a a sequence of jumps @xmath73 $ ] , which finishes in the same state it started and does not go through the same state more than one time .",
    "note that , except for cyclic reordering , the order of the states is relevant .",
    "given a current of the form ( [ cur ] ) , the increment related to a cycle is @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the number of states in the cycle .",
    "furthermore , the product of rates of the cycle @xmath76 , which we refer to as the rate of the cycle , is given by @xmath77 the set of all cycles in @xmath61 with at least three jumps is denoted by @xmath78 ( note that @xmath79 if @xmath76 is a transposition , a cycle with two states ) . given a cycle @xmath80 $ ] , its reverse @xmath81 $ ] is represented by @xmath82 and , therefore , @xmath83 .",
    "a spanning tree is a undirected connected set of edges that goes through all the vertices in @xmath61 and has no cycles ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . after choosing a maximal spanning tree , all edges that are not part of it are called chords .",
    "a chord is represented by @xmath84 and connects the states @xmath85 and @xmath86 ( from @xmath85 to @xmath86 ) .",
    "the number of chords does not depend on the choice of the maximal tree and is called chord number ( or cyclomatic number ) .",
    "whenever we add a chord to a maximal spanning tree we get a cycle , which is called fundamental cycle @xmath87 .",
    "these chords are important because for @xmath39 a general current of the form ( [ cur ] ) can be written as a linear composition of the elementary currents through the chords ( see formula ( [ curt ] ) below ) .",
    "as an example , in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we consider a four - state system , labeled by @xmath88 , where there are no transitions between @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "we show a spanning tree where the two links left out are the chords @xmath91 and @xmath71 .",
    "moreover , the two fundamental cycles associated with each chord are displayed in fig .",
    "note that this network has eight different spanning trees .    ) and ( [ wrel ] ) . on the left side we have the cycle @xmath92 , the first cycle on the right side is @xmath93 , and",
    "the second is @xmath94.,width=377 ]    moreover , any cycle in @xmath95 can be written as a linear combination of the fundamental cycles , i.e. , the fundamental cycles form an orthogonal basis ( this was originally found by kirchhoff @xcite ) . in order to see that we define the scalar product between a cycle and a pair of states as : @xmath96 this quantity gives an answer to the following question : is @xmath0 part of the cycle @xmath76 , and if yes , are they oriented in the same direction ?",
    "it is possible to show ( see @xcite ) that any cycle @xmath76 can be written as @xmath97 the basic reasons for this formula are that a chord is not shared by two fundamental cycles and it must belong to a cycle @xmath98 .",
    "this means that the increment of a cycle is given by @xmath99 furthermore , due to the fact that @xmath100 is a particular case of a current @xmath101 , as a corollary we get @xmath102    the elementary current through an edge @xmath0 can be written as a linear combination of elementary currents through the chords @xmath84 .",
    "explicitly , from the finite time kirchhoff s law ( [ kirchhofff ] ) we obtain the asymptotic relation @xmath103 therefore , from ( [ jc ] ) we see that the general current ( [ curasele ] ) takes the asymptotic form @xmath104 in particular , for the case of the entropy we have @xmath105    relation ( [ kirchhoff2 ] ) is normally written only for the ( average ) stationary current ( see @xcite ) , however , we stress that it is valid for any stochastic trajectory .",
    "an elegant and heuristic proof of ( [ kirchhoff2 ] ) for the stationary current can be found in @xcite , while a rigorous proof is given in @xcite .",
    "a graphical representation of the decomposition of a cycle @xmath76 into fundamental cycles using the scalar product ( [ scalar ] ) for a four - state system is showed in fig .",
    "the concepts developed here are central in studying the characteristic polynomial ( [ eq : det ] ) .",
    "we proceed by deriving a general necessary condition for the symmetry to set in for a non - entropic current .",
    "as we show below , this condition is related to degeneracy in the set of values of the increments of cycles @xmath101 .",
    "using the leibniz formula for determinants , the characteristic polynomial ( [ eq : det ] ) can be written as @xmath106 where @xmath107 is a permutation of the states @xmath5 and @xmath108 is the permutation group associated with @xmath4 .    moreover , each term of the determinant ( [ eq : devdet ] ) can be represented by a graph associated with the permutation @xmath107 on the network of states . due to the bijectivity of @xmath107 ,",
    "the graph is such that there is one transition rate entering and one transition rate leaving each state of the network .",
    "therefore , as is well known in discrete mathematics @xcite , each permutation @xmath107 can be decomposed as product of disjoint cycles ( with no common state ) .",
    "for example , in the case of seven states @xmath109 , the permutation @xmath110 mod@xmath111 , which is represented by @xmath112 , can be written as @xmath113 .",
    "we denote by @xmath114 the subset of the set of all cycles @xmath95 obtained from the cycles decomposition associated with @xmath107 .",
    "for example , in the case of @xmath110 mod@xmath111 we have @xmath115 .",
    "note that , as a consequence of the disjoint character of the cycles , the order of the cycles in @xmath114 is irrelevant .",
    "the increment related to @xmath114 is written as @xmath116 and the transition rate is given by @xmath117 with these quantities , the characteristic polynomial ( [ eq : devdet ] ) takes the expression @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the term which comes from the fixed states of the permutation ( @xmath120 ) and from the transpositions ( @xmath121@xmath122 ) .",
    "fixed states under the permutation contribute with the term @xmath123 , while transpositions contribute with the term @xmath124 .",
    "it then follows that @xmath125    we define the set @xmath126 of the different disjoint cycle decomposition related to @xmath108 .",
    "equation ( [ dete ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath127 where the last sum is restricted to permutations @xmath107 such that @xmath128 . since @xmath129 , where @xmath130 is the set of cycles composed of @xmath114 cycles in the reversed direction , we obtain @xmath131 where we used the properties @xmath132 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 .    imposing the symmetry @xmath135 and using formulas ( [ dete2 ] ) and ( [ carcy2 ] ) , we get @xmath136 we immediately see that , due to the independence of the family of exponential functions , the different and non - vanishing values of the set of increments @xmath137 play an important role in the analysis of this equation . in particular , we consider two complementary subsets @xmath138 for all chords @xmath84 , and @xmath139 .",
    "this means that @xmath140 is the subset of group of cycles formed by groups that contain only one of the fundamental cycles . if the sets of increments @xmath141 and @xmath142 fulfill the following conditions :    * @xmath143 for all fundamental cycles ; * @xmath144 for all pair of chords @xmath145 ; * the set of increments @xmath141 is disjoint with @xmath142",
    ".    then relation ( [ fondsym ] ) implies that @xmath146 in this case , we see from ( [ curt ] ) and ( [ entt ] ) that @xmath147 : we have the familiar gcem symmetry because at large times @xmath148 is just the entropy current ( up to a constant )",
    ". therefore we arrive at the following conclusion : in order to have a symmetric current asymptotically different from entropy either at least one of the increments in the set @xmath149 has to be zero or we need degeneracy in the increments of the fundamental cycles , in the sense that at least one of the last two conditions has to be broken .",
    "this is a main result of the present paper and we think it should play an important role in developing a more general theory for the symmetries of large deviation function associated with time - integrated currents .",
    "two remarks are in time .",
    "first we stress that this is a necessary condition on the full spectrum of the modified generator : it could be that there is a situation where a non - entropic current for which this condition is not fulfilled ( implying in an asymmetric characteristic polynomial ) still has a symmetric maximum eigenvalue ( which gives the scaled cumulant generating function ) .",
    "the other remark is a comparison of our work with @xcite , where the condition ( [ andrieux ] ) was obtained as a necessary and sufficient condition for the gcem symmetry through a similar analysis of the characteristic polynomial ( [ eq : devdet ] ) .",
    "the `` single macroscopic current '' considered in @xcite is proportional to the entropy current and here we are interested in non - entropic currents , which might have a symmetric characteristic polynomial precisely when condition ( [ andrieux ] ) is not satisfied .",
    "another difference is that in@xcite a sort of coarse - grained current is considered , where the number of cycles , and not of the elementary jumps , is counted . in this case one",
    "takes a derived markov process which is obtained from the original process by cutting off cycles @xcite .",
    "even though we found a general necessary condition , this is still far from a sufficient condition . as we show next , in order for a symmetry to set in the transition rates have to fulfill some constraints , which depend on the kind of degeneracy we have among the increments in the set @xmath150 . in the next section",
    "we perform a full analysis of all possible symmetric time - integrated currents different from entropy that arise in a four - state system . specifically , we consider the network of states of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where all but one pair of states are connected .",
    "we show that in this case , two classes of symmetric currents different from entropy exist , one of them corresponding to the symmetry previously found in @xcite .",
    "moreover , in the [ aa ] we perform a similar analysis for the fully connected network , where there are several different classes of symmetric time - integrated currents .",
    "the network of fig . [ fig1 ] has two @xmath151jumps cycles and one @xmath152jumps cycle .",
    "they are @xmath153 , @xmath72 , and @xmath92 , where @xmath154 is the @xmath152jumps cycle .",
    "besides the forward cycles there are also the three backward cycles , which are denoted by @xmath155 , @xmath156 , and @xmath157 .",
    "the increment of the cycles is denoted by @xmath158 and the forward ( backward ) rate by @xmath159 ( @xmath160 ) , with @xmath161 . moreover ,",
    "for later convenience we write the escape rates from states @xmath89 and @xmath90 as @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "if we choose the spanning tree showed in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the two chords are @xmath91 and @xmath71 , whereas the fundamental cycles are @xmath164 and @xmath165 , respectively . the rate and increment of the cycle @xmath154 fulfills the following relations . from ( [ krel ] )",
    "we obtain ( see fig . [ fig2 ] ) @xmath166 and from ( [ wrel ] ) we have @xmath167 furthermore , from ( [ curt ] ) , asymptotically , a general current is written as @xmath168 for the case of the entropy the above formula becomes @xmath169 where @xmath170 is a constant .",
    "hitherto we have defined entropy as the current for which @xmath171 , in this section we denote @xmath56 any current that is asymptotically proportional to entropy .",
    "note that in this case the gcem symmetry ( [ gcemscaled ] ) changes to @xmath172 , where @xmath173 ( see @xcite ) .    with the above definitions we can now look for the currents with a symmetric characteristic polynomial . as we showed in the previous section , the symmetry implies the fulfillment of equation ( [ fondsym ] ) . in the present case this equation takes the form @xmath174 where we used the fact that the permutations related to @xmath164 and @xmath165 have positive sign and",
    "the permutation related to @xmath154 has negative sign .",
    "we also showed in the previous section that in order to have a symmetric current different from entropy either one of the increments of the fundamental cycles has to be zero , or one of the fundamental cycles must have the same increment as another cycle ( fundamental or non - fundamental ) . in the present case",
    "this leaves us with six possibilities :    * @xmath175 ; * @xmath176 ; * @xmath177 or @xmath178 ; * @xmath179 , which gives @xmath180 , or @xmath181 , which gives @xmath182 .",
    "we first consider the family of currents @xmath183 , which have the cycle increments @xmath184 , implying @xmath185 .",
    "this means that all currents is this family have the following common asymptotic behavior , @xmath186 note that the sufficient relation for the symmetry ( [ symcondfour ] ) depends only on the values of @xmath187 , @xmath188 and @xmath189 .",
    "therefore , it is identical for all currents in this family .",
    "we want to find out under which conditions a current with the assymptotic form ( [ cura ] ) is symmetric and different from @xmath56 . from equation ( [ symcondfour ] ) we obtain @xmath190 where we are using @xmath191 for the symmetric factor related to current ( [ cura ] ) .",
    "this relation defines the value of @xmath191 as a function of the transition rates .",
    "moreover , also from ( [ symcondfour ] ) we get @xmath192 the transition rates fulfill this equation if @xmath193 or @xmath194 . clearly , from equations ( [ entfour1 ] ) and ( [ cura ] ) , in the second case we have @xmath195 ( with @xmath171 ) .",
    "therefore , we obtain that the spectrum related to @xmath183 is symmetric and this current is different from entropy if @xmath196 therefore , we have the symmetry @xmath197 with @xmath191 given by ( [ e1first ] ) .",
    "the second family of currents @xmath198 corresponds to the case @xmath199 , where @xmath200 .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the currents in this family is @xmath201 following the same procedure of the previous case , from equation ( [ symcondfour ] ) we obtain that the symmetric factor is defined as @xmath202 and the transition rates have to fulfill the constraint @xmath203 in this case the transition rates are such that @xmath193 or @xmath204 , where the second equality implies @xmath198 proportional to entropy . in addition , since @xmath189 is different from zero , relation ( [ symcondfour ] ) gives us an extra constraint , which is @xmath205 where we used @xmath206 and relation ( [ wrelfour ] ) .",

    "hence , the associated family of currents have the asymptotic form @xmath212 .",
    "equation ( [ symcondfour ] ) gives the constraint @xmath213 this is satisfied only if @xmath214 , which gives @xmath215 .",
    "this leads to the entropy current being proportional to the elementary current through @xmath91 and , therefore , there is no new symmetry in this case .",
    "the case @xmath178 is analogous .",
    "finally , for the case @xmath216 , equation ( [ symcondfour ] ) gives the constraint @xmath217 this is satisfied only if @xmath218 , which leads to @xmath219 .",
    "this last relation implies the associated current being proportional to entropy : there is no new symmetry .",
    "the case @xmath220 is analogous .      in order to illustrate these symmetries we consider the symmetric exclusion process ( sep ) @xcite",
    "this is a one dimensional transport model which is driven out of equilibrium by the boundary dynamics . particles enter and leave the system at the left and right boundary , while they diffuse in the bulk .",
    "they also interact in the bulk by imposing that the maximum number of particles per site is one .",
    "more generally , we will consider a sep where the transition rates for particles to enter or leave the system depends on the bulk density .",
