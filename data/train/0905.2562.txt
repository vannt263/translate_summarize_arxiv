    "the entanglement entropy associated to a region @xmath0 of the space in quantum field theory ( qft ) , is a quantity with manifold interests , ranging from the area of quantum computing and the study of quantum systems in terms of their information content @xcite , to the physics of black holes @xcite and the holographic principle @xcite , passing through investigations with interest intrinsic to condensed matter @xcite and qft itself @xcite .",
    "the problem of an observer who has access only to a subset of the complete set of observables associated to a quantum system gives us the precise scenario to introduce the concept of the entanglement entropy .",
    "the trace over the degrees of freedom localized on a region which is not accessible to the observer , results in a reduced density matrix . in particular , if the state of the quantum system is the vacuum , the local density matrix @xmath1 reduced to a region @xmath0 of the space is @xmath2 where the trace is over the degrees of freedom lying outside @xmath0 .",
    "then , the entanglement entropy is the von neumann entropy associated to @xmath1 @xmath3    the free quantum field theories play here , as is often the case , the role of the simplest models available to the research .",
    "however , even in the free case exact results on the entanglement entropy are scarce , and require solving difficult questions about the spectrum of certain integral operators , or equivalent questions expressed as functional integrals .",
    "powerful numerical methods on the lattice are known which reduce the calculation of @xmath4 to a diagonalization of few @xmath5 matrices , where @xmath6 is the number of lattice points in @xmath0 .",
    "this is in contrast to the @xmath7 matrix which is at least expected in a generic model with @xmath8 states per site .",
    "this important reduction in computing time allows one to take a close look at the behavior of the entropy function in the free case , at least for low dimension space - times .",
    "the difference between free and interacting qft models is not evident in terms of the entanglement entropy alone , and has not been elucidated yet in these terms .",
    "this makes the study of the free models more interesting because it may reveal features which are common to all qft .",
    "in particular , the ultraviolet behavior is one of these features . in @xmath9 spatial dimensions we should have for any qft @xmath10\\,\\epsilon^{-(d-1)}+ ... + g_1[\\partial v]\\,\\epsilon^{-1 } + g_0[\\partial v]\\,\\log ( \\epsilon)+ s_0(v)\\ , ,    \\label{div}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is a finite part , @xmath12 is a short distance cutoff , and the @xmath13 are local and extensive functions on the boundary @xmath14 , which are homogeneous of degree @xmath15 .",
    "the leading divergent term coefficient @xmath16 $ ] is then proportional to the @xmath17 power of the size of @xmath0 , and this is usually referred to as the area law for the entanglement entropy .",
    "this area law is a consequence of the large number of degrees of freedom at high energies present in the qft which induce entanglement across the boundary @xmath14 .",
    "the divergent terms are essentially produced by high energy vacuum fluctuations and thus they are the same for all finite energy density states , such as a thermal state . ) ) for specific states such as the ground state , or a state with chemical potential ( for a review and a complete list of references see @xcite ) .",
    "it is known that for fermions in a lattice and finite chemical potential the entanglement entropy grows as the area with a multiplicative logarithmic correction @xcite . however , this does not affect the formula ( [ div ] ) since these terms induced by the chemical potential are finite and independent of the cutoff in the continuum limit , that is , they are included in the finite part @xmath18 .",
    "the same holds for the finite volume increasing terms in a thermal state , which should also satisfy an area law in the sense of ( [ div ] ) . ]",
    "these terms proportional to @xmath13 for @xmath19 are not physical within qft since they are not related to quantities well defined in the continuum . on the contrary",
    ", the coefficient @xmath20 of the log term is expected to be universal ( in this review we use the word universal in the sense of independence of the regularization prescription or of the microscopic model used to obtain the continuum qft at distances large with respect to the cutoff ) .",
    "there are also many universal terms which are included in @xmath18 , but have to be extracted taking into account that the definition of @xmath18 is affected by finite changes in the cutoff .    among the universal quantities related to the entropy an important role",
    "is played by the mutual information @xmath21 between two non intersecting regions @xmath22 and @xmath23 @xcite , ( see figure [ figu0 ] ) @xmath24 the universal character is due to the cancellation of the boundary terms .",
    "another useful dimensionless universal quantity defined in two dimensions and for an interval of size @xmath25 is given by @xmath26 the entropic @xmath27-function @xmath28 is always positive and decreasing , and plays the role of the zamolodchikov s @xmath27-function @xcite in the entanglement entropy @xmath27-theorem @xcite .",
    "it contains all the universal information present on the entropy for an interval , since @xmath29 follows from @xmath28 by integration , except for an arbitrary constant .",
    "accordingly , in this review we will present the results for the entanglement entropy for single intervals in two dimensions in terms of @xmath28 .",
    "still related to the local density matrix , there is a family of functions called the alpha or renyi entropies , @xmath30 which share some of the entanglement entropy properties .",
    "these are often easier to compute , and one has @xmath31 for an interval in two dimensions a quantity analogous to the entropic c - function ( [ centralcharge ] ) can be defined as @xmath32    [ tbp ] = 15.8 cm    this review is focused on vacuum entanglement entropy in relativistic free qft and its associated universal quantities . in what follows",
    "we describe two general methods to calculate the geometric entropy for free fields .",
    "we then give examples where these methods are applied in two , three and more dimensions for scalar and dirac fields .",
    "free gauge fields have not been sufficiently studied in the literature yet .",
    "they have an additional technical problem since the divergent terms in ( [ div ] ) are non gauge invariant .",
    "most of the material is already present in the literature , but we have also included some new results , and reformulated earlier work .",
    "there are several topics related to entanglement for free fields discussed in the literature but not belonging to our main subject which will not be covered here .",
    "these topics include entanglement entropy in presence of temperature , chemical potential , or excited states @xcite , manifolds with boundary @xcite , different ( newton - wigner ) localization schemes @xcite , entanglement in curved space - time @xcite , and in non - lorentz covariant qft ( quantum lifshitz fixed points ) @xcite .",
    "there is also a large body of work done in the context of lattice models , which extends out of the scope of this review .",
    "there are several excellent review papers in this area @xcite .",
    "in the euclidean approach one starts from the representation of the vacuum state in terms of a path integral . for definiteness",
    "consider a scalar field @xmath33 , and take the basis formed by eigenvectors of this field operator at time @xmath34 as @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is any real function on the space .",
    "the vacuum wave functional writes @xcite @xmath37 in order to select the vacuum state , the functional integral is over the lower half space and with euclidean time .",
    "@xmath38 is the euclidean action and @xmath39 is a normalization factor .",
    "the vacuum density matrix in this basis is @xmath40 . in order to trace over degrees of freedom in @xmath41 ,",
    "the set complementary to @xmath0 , one considers functions @xmath42 , @xmath43 , which coincide ( are equal to @xmath44 ) on @xmath41 , and sum over all possible functions @xmath44 . using the representation ( [ qs ] ) this construction of the reduced density matrix amounts to take two copies of the half space , glue them on @xmath41 ( see figure [ figu1 ] ) , and take the functional integral in this space @xcite , @xmath45 the arguments of the density matrix are the boundary conditions of the path integral on both sides of the cut on @xmath0 .    for fermions a similar construction holds , but there is an important difference . since the fields at equal time anticommute , the functional integral and the boundary conditions are in terms of grassmann variables . in order to represent the trace in the functional integral we have to sum over the antidiagonal elements @xcite , that is @xmath46 where now all variables involved are grassmann valued .",
    "this extra minus sign is well known in the calculation of the thermal partition function for fermions , which requires antiperiodic boundary conditions . here",
    ", this implies that when we glue the two copies of the half space along @xmath41 we have to take boundary conditions related by a minus sign .",
    "this cut at @xmath41 can be eliminated by changing integration variables @xmath47 in the upper half plane .",
    "the net result is that there is an additional minus sign in the boundary condition for the density matrix in the upper side of the cut over @xmath0 in figure [ figu1 ] , @xmath48    [ tbp ]    the representation of the traces @xmath49 involved in ( [ esealfa ] ) by a functional integral is then realized by the replication method which consists on taking @xmath50 copies of the euclidean plane cut along @xmath0 , and sewing together the upper side of the cut in the @xmath51 copy with the lower one of the @xmath52 copy , for @xmath53 @xcite . here",
    "the copy @xmath54 coincides with the first one ( see figure [ figu2 ] ) .",
    "the resulting space is a @xmath50-sheeted @xmath55 dimensional euclidean space with conical singularities of angle @xmath56 located at the boundary @xmath14 of the set @xmath0 . for fermions , the final trace ( after the power @xmath57 has been taken ) also involves a sign change in the boundary conditions .",
    "we can change variables in order to have all gluing with no additional signs except for the last one , where the field on the upper side of the @xmath58 cut is equated to @xmath59 times the field on the lower side of the first cut @xcite . here , one minus sign counts for each copy of the density matrix plus one extra minus sign for the trace half a spatial hyperplane , the density matrix is proportional to @xmath60 , with @xmath61 the boost operator which keeps the rindler wedge fixed @xcite . in the euclidean version , the boost operator corresponds to a rotation operator and @xmath62 to a rotation operator of angle @xmath63 . when translated into the path integral formalism this provides a different look to the origin of the signs on the fermion boundary conditions in this case @xcite . ] .",
    "finally we have @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the functional integral on the @xmath50-sheeted manifold , and we have used the normalization factor @xmath66 in order to have @xmath67 .",
    "( [ cheto ] ) gives a representation of the renyi entropies for integer @xmath50 .",
    "the entanglement entropy follows by analytic continuation of @xmath68 down to @xmath69 ( [ alpha ] ) .      in general",
    ", calculating the integrals @xmath65 explicitly is a very difficult problem since we have to deal with a non trivial manifold resulting from the replication method .",
    "fortunately , in the case of free fields , a simplification follows by mapping the @xmath50-sheeted problem to an equivalent one in which one deals with @xmath50 decoupled and multivalued free fields @xcite .",
    "for that , one introduces a vector field @xmath70 living on a single @xmath55 dimensional space , whose components are the values of the fields in the different copies , @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the field on the @xmath73 copy . note that in this way the space is simply connected but the singularities at the boundaries of @xmath0 are still there since the vector @xmath70 is not singled valued .",
    "in fact , crossing @xmath0 from above or from below , the field gets multiplied by a matrix @xmath74 or @xmath75 respectively , where @xmath76 the upper sign in this equation corresponds to the bosonic case and the lower one to fermions .",
    "this matrix has eigenvalues @xmath77 , with @xmath78 ( the @xmath79 roots of @xmath80 ) in the scalar case , and @xmath77 with @xmath81 ( the @xmath79 roots of @xmath59 ) , in the fermionic one .",
    "then , changing basis by a unitary transformation in the replica space , we can diagonalize @xmath74 , and the problem is reduced to @xmath50 decoupled fields @xmath82 living on a single @xmath55 dimensional space",
    ". at this point is essential the free character of the action , and we also need to deal with complex fields .",
    "this last requirement is not a limitation since in order to compute the entanglement entropy we can double the number of real fields and then divide the final result by two .",
    "the fields which diagonalize @xmath74 are multivalued and defined on the euclidean @xmath55 dimensional space with boundary conditions imposed on the @xmath9 dimensional set @xmath0 given by @xmath83    [ tbp ]    here @xmath84 are the limits of the field as the variable approaches @xmath0 from each of its two opposite sides in @xmath55 dimensions .    in this formulation we have for scalars @xmath85\\ , , \\label{r1}\\ ] ] and for fermions @xmath86\\ , , \\label{r2}\\ ] ] where @xmath87 $ ] is the partition function corresponding to a field which acquires a phase @xmath88 when the variable crosses @xmath0 ( figure [ figu2 ] ) , divided by @xmath89 .    to further specify these partition functions one has to take into account that the fields must have a specific asymptotic behavior as the variable approaches the singularity in order to have finite action .",
    "this requirement will be different according the action is quadratic ( scalars ) or linear ( fermions ) in derivatives . for smooth @xmath0 boundaries we have @xmath90 in the limit of short @xmath91 , where @xmath91 is the distance between @xmath92 and @xmath14 .",
    "note that ( [ r1 ] ) and ( [ r2 ] ) give the same formula for the limit @xmath93 , @xmath94\\,.\\ ] ]      the evaluation of the entropy is still limited by the difficulty in doing the analytic continuation of @xmath68 for non - integer @xmath50 , and then the limit ( [ alpha ] ) . the analytic continuation of a function defined on the integers is not unique unless some further information is provided .",
    "one such requirement would be the condition @xmath95 for re@xmath96 , which is the hypothesis of the carlson s theorem @xcite .",
    "this holds for finite dimensional density matrices , but for universal terms in @xmath68 in a continuum theory no general result is known . for",
    "a discussion around this point see @xcite .",
    "the analytic continuation for the free fields which satisfies carlson s criterion can be obtained in a natural way writing the sums in @xmath68 as a contour integrals @xcite .",
    "we will check in section 2.3 that the result coincides with the entanglement entropy obtained by the real time approach .",
    "we treat first the scalar case .",
    "( [ r1 ] ) can be written @xmath97}{u - e^{i 2 \\pi k / n}}=\\frac{1}{2\\pi i ( 1-n)}\\oint du \\,\\frac{n\\ , u^{n-1}}{u^n-1}\\,\\textrm{log}z[u]\\,,\\label{chuta}\\ ] ] where the contour of integration encircles the roots of the unit .",
    "the function @xmath98 $ ] is defined as the unique analytic continuation of the function @xmath99 $ ] on the unit circle .",
    "since we need to avoid the negative real axis for the formula ( [ chuta ] ) to be analytic for non integer @xmath50 , we choose the integration contour as in figure [ figu22 ] .",
    "thus , we are assuming @xmath98 $ ] is analytic on the negative real axes and @xmath100\\right|/\\left|u\\right|^x\\rightarrow 0 $ ] as @xmath101 for some @xmath102 ( we will show this holds for the universal terms in @xmath103 $ ] in section 2.3 ) .",
    "in the limit @xmath104 we have @xmath105\\,.\\label{chuta1}\\ ] ] at @xmath106 , @xmath98 $ ] vanishes .",
    "we also have the identity @xmath87=z[e^{-i 2 \\pi a}]$ ] , due to the euclidean time reflection symmetry .",

    "thus , the only singularity is the cut of the logarithm and we obtain @xmath109}{(\\lambda+1)^2}\\,,\\label{boti}\\ ] ] where we have used the property ( [ propi ] ) .",
    "[ tbp ] = 4.3 cm    the fermion case can be treated similarly .",
    "the sum of residues in this case is over the roots of @xmath59 , giving @xmath110}{u - e^{i 2 \\pi k / n}}=\\frac{1}{2\\pi i ( 1-n)}\\oint dv \\,\\frac{n\\ , v^{n-1}}{v^n+1}\\,\\textrm{log}z[-v]\\,.\\label{chuta2}\\ ] ] for the last integral in @xmath111 we choose the contour in figure [ figu22 ] ( the same as for scalars ) .",
    "again , using property ( [ propi ] ) , the limit @xmath104 gives @xmath112}{(\\lambda-1)^2}\\,.\\label{vein}\\ ] ] where we assume @xmath113\\right|/\\lambda^x\\rightarrow 0 $ ] as @xmath114 for some @xmath102 .",
    "in concrete examples , the result for @xmath115 $ ] automatically gives a formula for the analytic extension @xmath103 $ ] .",
    "then the entropy is calculated by ( [ boti ] ) or ( [ vein ] ) .",
    "one of the most powerful methods for computing the partition function of quadratic actions is the heat kernel method . to introduce it ,",
    "consider a free scalar , and note that @xmath116 the partition function then reduces to an spectral function of a differential operator .",
    "the heat kernel is defined as @xmath117 , and its trace writes @xmath118 the free energy @xmath119 can be written in terms of this spectral function as @xmath120 where @xmath12 is a cutoff .",
    "the advantage of this equation if that , in contrast with ( [ with ] ) , it is written as a function of the trace of an operator which satisfies a local heat equation @xmath121 this means that systematic expansions for short time @xmath122 of the trace of the heat kernel can be developed , leading to an expansion of the form ( for a review see @xcite ) @xmath123 here @xmath124 is the manifold dimension , and @xmath9 is the dimension of space . in general , the heat kernel coefficients @xmath125 are integrals of local quantities depending on the different background tensors .",
    "this may include a smooth metric , interactions with external sources or fields , or a smooth boundary and boundary conditions .",
    "an expansion is known for different spins up to the first few @xmath126 in the general case .",
    "however , the application of the heat kernel expansions to the entanglement entropy in flat space vacuum is made difficult because of two reasons .",
    "the first one is that the short @xmath122 expansion is an ultraviolet one .",
    "thus , the non divergent contributions , which represent genuine physical terms in the entanglement entropy , are the ones proportional to the coefficients @xmath125 with @xmath127 .",
    "the case @xmath128 gives a logarithmically divergent contribution to the entanglement entropy , with universal coefficient which is proportional to the conformal anomaly ( see section 3.3.3 ) . obtaining these large - index coefficients becomes increasingly difficult for higher dimensions .",
    "the second reason is that the manifold has conical singularities along the boundary of the region @xmath0 , and the standard expansions can not be applied directly to this case .",
    "expansions in presence of conical singularities in the limit of small deficit angle , with bulk curvature , and smooth @xmath14 having zero extrinsic curvature , have been developed in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "they where applied to obtain logarithmic corrections of the black hole entropy in different scenarios @xcite .",
    "recently , the contribution of the extrinsic curvature was found in four dimensions , and used to calculate the logarithmic term of the vacuum entanglement entropy in minkowski space with smooth @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "we will review this result in section 3.3.3 .",
    "contributions from a non smooth boundary become intractable with the heat kernel method .",
    "we will encounter this type of term in section 3.2 .",
    "another possible strategy to find the partition function consists in studying the associated green function @xmath129 on the manifold relevant to the problem .",
    "these are related by the identity @xmath130 however , there are no general methods to calculate @xmath131 for this type of manifolds with a codimension one cut on a finite region , and a case by case analysis seems unavoidable . in some of the examples we review in section 3 ,",
    "we have used a method originally introduced by myers in @xcite to deal with neumann and dirichlet boundary conditions on a finite cut in two dimensions .",
    "it essentially consists in exploiting the symmetries of the helmholtz equation , even in the presence of the boundary conditions , by analyzing the singular behavior of @xmath132 at the end points of the cut , which effectively control the solutions of the source free equation . with this tool we could calculate the entropy for a single interval for massive free fields ( sections 3.1.1 and 3.1.2 ) and the coefficient of the term logarithmic in the cutoff for a plane angular sector in two dimensions ( section 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 ) .    in @xmath133 other techniques",
    "are also available .",
    "in particular the bosonization technique can be used to evaluate @xmath65 for the dirac field ( section 3.1.5 ) .",
    "one expresses the fermionic current in terms of a dual scalar field @xmath134 as @xmath135 .",
    "the resulting dual theory is the sine gordon theory , and the functional @xmath65 is given in terms of a sum of correlators of local exponential operators @xcite .",
    "this is a particular case of the general one in one dimensional space , since @xmath65 can always be expressed as a correlator of twisting operators @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "these are non local relative to the ordinary fields , and effectively impose the boundary conditions .",
    "the correlators of twisting operators for general integrable massive quantum field theories have been studied from a s matrix approach . in particular cases ,",
    "an expansion of the correlators in form factors is known , and they can be evaluated as a sum over intermediate multi - particle states .",
    "these expansions have been exploited in relation with entanglement entropy in @xcite .      in the real time approach one",
    "aims to compute directly the reduced density matrix corresponding to the global vacuum state in terms of correlators .",
    "one starts with a discrete version of the quantum field theory and eventually takes the continuum limit .",
    "the first calculations of the entanglement entropy where made in this way @xcite , several years before the euclidean approach was developed .",
    "this method has been mainly applied to numerical calculations in the lattice .",
    "even if it has not been exploited as much as the euclidean approach for analytic calculations , we think it is better suited to several generalizations .",
    "for example , it can be used in calculations involving spatial sets which are not contained in a single spatial hyperplane in minkowski space , for which the euclidean approach becomes inapplicable .",
    "the interactions can be included in a straightforward way , at least at the perturbative level @xcite .",
    "also , the case of some states different from the vacuum seems to be tractable with this method .",
    "however , these applications have not been fully developed in the literature yet .",
    "first , let us describe briefly how this approach was formulated originally",
    ". for a system of harmonic oscillators with hamiltonian @xmath136 the ground state wave function can be easily obtained by diagonalization @xmath137 where @xmath138 .",
    "the corresponding density matrix in coordinate representation is @xmath139    then , one selects the variables @xmath140 and @xmath141 corresponding to the degrees of freedom inside and outside @xmath0 .",
    "the trace over the @xmath141 can be done by integration of the gaussian in ( [ refe ] ) .",
    "writing @xmath142 in the base where the inside variables @xmath143 are the first ones , one arrives at @xmath144 where @xmath145 the entropy follows by writing the density matrix as one for non coupled degrees of freedom by making a linear transformation of coordinates .",
    "finally we have @xmath146    this calculation has first been done in @xcite .",
    "it was later rediscovered in @xcite where it was applied to free quantum fields discretized in the radial direction in polar coordinates . for fermions",
    "a similar calculation , has been done in @xcite .    in the following ,",
    "we use a method which starts with a different perspective , and gives equivalent results in a way more suitable to generalizations . by its very definition ,",
    "the reduced density matrix @xmath1 corresponding to the region @xmath0 , is the state acting on the local algebra of operators in @xmath0 which leads to the same expectation values as the global vacuum state , @xmath147 for any operator @xmath148 localized inside a @xmath0 .",
    "if we take the point of view of the wightman theorem @xcite , where one defines a quantum field theory in terms of the correlators , this equation suggests that the knowledge of all the correlators inside @xmath0 must be enough to determine the density matrix @xmath1 .",
    "this is specially simple in the free case , where the wick theorem means that all the correlators are reduced to the two point function .",
    "this fact was used by peschel to give an expression for @xmath149 in terms of correlators for free boson and fermion discrete systems @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "similar expressions for the local density matrices in terms of correlators where obtained long time ago by araki @xcite .",
    "his work is framed in a more general and mathematically oriented context , classifying the possible states satisfying the wick theorem ( called quasifree states ) for algebras obeying the canonical commutation and anti - commutation relations .      the local hermitian variables @xmath150 and @xmath151 ( coordinate and conjugate momentum ) obey the canonical commutation relations @xmath152=i\\delta _ { ij}\\,,\\hspace{1 cm } [ \\phi _ { i},\\phi _ { j}]=[\\pi _ { i},\\pi _ { j}]=0\\,.\\ ] ] take the two point correlators inside @xmath0 to be @xmath153 this last equation can be generalized to have @xmath154 , but ( [ need ] ) is all we need for the vacuum state .",
    "the equations in ( [ atre ] ) imply the matrices @xmath155 and @xmath156 are real hermitian and positive .",
    "the positivity of @xmath157 for arbitrary constants @xmath158 implies that @xmath159 in matrix sense , what means that the eigenvalues of @xmath160 are greater than @xmath161 .",
    "we assume all other non zero correlators are obtained from these by the wick s theorem @xmath162 where the sum is over all the index permutations @xmath163 , the @xmath164 can be any of the field or momentum variables , and @xmath165 is an ordering prescription , for example , ordering the products inside the expectation values with the field variables at the left and the momentum variables on the right .",
    "once this equation holds for a specific ordering automatically holds for any other ordering .",

    "is also proportional to the field correlator squared and decays exponentially quickly . in particular , in one dimension we have @xcite @xmath627 where @xmath628 and @xmath629 are the total lengths of @xmath22 and @xmath23 , assumed much smaller than @xmath630 and @xmath25 .    [ tbp ] = 5.3 cm    a similar calculation for scalars on a lattice shows also a decay going like the field correlator squared . for massless fields this gives @xmath631 , which is slower than the fermionic case .",
    "it is instructive to obtain this behavior with a different approach .",
    "the mutual information is an upper bound on correlation @xcite @xmath632 where @xmath633 and @xmath634 are any bounded operators in the local algebras corresponding to @xmath22 and @xmath23 , with norms @xmath635 and @xmath636 respectively .",
    "we can not apply this relation directly to the smeared scalar field operator , @xmath637 , with @xmath638 an smooth function of compact support , since this is not bounded .",
    "however , using the inequality ( [ dfg ] ) with the unitary operators @xmath639 and @xmath640 , and @xmath638 , @xmath641 vanishing outside @xmath22 , @xmath23 respectively , we obtain , @xmath642      in the euclidean approach the entanglement entropy is obtained from the effective action @xmath643 calculated in an euclidean @xmath55 dimensional manifold with conical singularities on @xmath14 .",
    "we have the general expansion @xmath644 the non universal terms diverge as inverse powers of the cutoff @xmath12 . in the case of a free theory @xmath645",
    "coincides with the corresponding heat kernel coefficient ( [ ggg ] ) . for a general conformal theory",
    "it is determined by the integrated conformal anomaly . in order to see this , consider an infinitesimal rescaling of the metric @xmath646 . since @xmath647 in terms of the energy momentum tensor @xmath648 , we have @xmath649 which is the integrated trace anomaly ( classically , for a conformally invariant theory we should have @xmath650 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "due to the conformal invariance of the action , scaling the metric as above must give the same result as keeping the metric constant but contracting the cutoff as @xmath651 .",
    "using ( [ polo ] ) this gives @xmath652 the trace anomaly for smooth manifolds has a local expression in terms of polynomials of the curvature tensor of dimensionality equal to @xmath55 .",
    "thus , it must vanish for odd spacetime dimensions . in four spacetime dimensions",
    "it writes @xcite @xmath653 where @xmath538 and @xmath27 are the anomaly coefficients , which are a characteristic property of the theory .",
    "here they are normalized such that @xmath654 for the real scalar . for a weyl fermion",
    "it is @xmath655 , @xmath656 @xcite .",
    "as they stand these equations can not be used for evaluating the entanglement entropy in flat space since the bulk curvature tensor @xmath657 , and , on the other hand , there is a conical singularity at @xmath14 .",
    "however , it was argued by fursaev and solodukhin in @xcite that at lowest order in the deficit angle @xmath658 , the contribution of the surface term is proportional to this deficit , @xmath659 and @xmath660 can be calculated using the same expressions ( [ gfgf]-[last ] ) , with a curvature tensor proportional to a delta - function concentrated in @xmath14 . from ( [ alpha ] ) this gives the logarithmic term in the entanglement entropy @xmath661 the value of @xmath660 in ( [ yeye ] ) was obtained in @xcite for the case of zero extrinsic curvature of the surface @xmath14 , and used to calculate corrections to the entanglement entropy of the black hole @xcite ( the extrinsic curvature of the horizon vanishes ) .",
    "the contribution of the extrinsic curvature is however crucial for the geometric entropy in flat space .",
    "this was obtained recently by solodukhin in @xcite .",
    "his approach consists in demanding conformal invariance of the most general geometric expression for the logarithmic contribution , and then using the holographic anzats of ryu and takayanagi ( which is applicable to the special case of the entanglement entropy of @xmath662 superconformal gauge theories @xcite ) in order to calibrate a coefficient .",
    "the result in flat space is , @xmath663 . ]",
    "@xcite @xmath664 here @xmath665 is the second fundamental form , @xmath666 with @xmath667 are a pair of unit vectors orthogonal to @xmath14 , and @xmath668 is the induced metric on the surface . in the first term ,",
    "the integral @xmath669 , where @xmath670 is the euler number of the surface , which is purely topological .    for a sphere ( [ turti ] ) gives @xcite @xmath671 while for a cylinder of length @xmath25 and radius @xmath329 it is @xcite @xmath672 the sphere and the cylinder are then sensitive to different anomaly coefficients .    note here that for the electromagnetic field it is @xmath673 and @xmath674 .",
    "this shows the entanglement entropy of the electromagnetic field can not be assimilated to the one of a pair of massless scalars .",
    "also note that there are some conflicting results in the literature which do not coincide with the above formulas for the logarithmic coefficient in three spatial dimensions for scalar fields @xcite .",
    "the obvious missing subject on this review about entanglement entropy for free fields is the one of free gauge fields .",
    "in fact , though there are a few works on this sense in the literature , the entanglement entropy for gauge fields has not been fully understood yet .",
    "there are some problems in the definition of @xmath4 in this case , since there is no gauge invariant partition of the hilbert space as a tensor product of the hilbert spaces corresponding to degree of freedom on two complementary regions ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "perhaps this is the origin of the boundary term noticed in the early works for the electromagnetic field @xcite , which would make the area term non - gauge invariant . at present",
    "it is not known if the mutual information is well defined in the presence of gauge symmetries .",
    "other problems directly related to free fields also seem to be worth of further work .",
    "one is the problem of defining the real time formulation for bosons directly in the continuum . in this case",
    "it is easy to see by dimensionality arguments that the correlators @xmath155 and @xmath156 of section 2.2.1 are not well defined in the continuum , while @xmath675 , which is the operator relevant to the entropy calculation , has the right units .",
    "one should be able to obtain this continuum operator directly , without passing through a regularization of @xmath155 and @xmath156 .",
    "we think this issue has to be understood before attacking the problem posed by the localization of abelian gauge fields .",
    "other interesting research subjects include the treatment of excitations , which seem to allow a systematic formulation in the real time approach , and the development of a perturbative theory for the reduced density matrix .",
    "we thank p. calabrese , j. cardy and b. doyon for their kind invitation to collaborate with this review to a special issue on _ entanglement entropy in extended quantum systems _ in journal of physica a. we also thank cesar fosco for many fruitful discussions .",
