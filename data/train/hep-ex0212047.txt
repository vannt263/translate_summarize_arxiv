    "the generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) provide a unified description of the nucleon . as explained by m. diehl  @xcite , they interpolate between the parton distributions and the hadronic form factors .",
    "experimentally the gpds can be accessed in exclusive measurements such as hard exclusive meson ( @xmath7 ) production ( hemp ) and deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) .",
    "the latter reaction is the simplest from the theoretical point of view but also the most difficult experimentally because one has to select perfectly the final state ( one lepton , one proton and one photon ) among all the possible reactions . in pratice",
    "we can by now start the investigation of meson production and we foresee an upgrade of the compass setup for dvcs measurement .",
    "0.5    experiments have already been undertaken at very high energy with the hera collider to study mainly the gluon gpds at very small @xmath1 ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "larger values of @xmath1 have been investigated in fixed target experiments at jlab ( 6 gev , with plans for an upgrade at 11 gev ) and hermes ( at 27 gev ) .",
    "the experimental program using compass at cern ( at 100 and/or 190 gev ) will enlarge the kinematical domain to a large range of @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( 1.5 @xmath2 7 gev@xmath3 and 0.03 @xmath4 0.25 ) ( see fig . [ kindam ] ) . a large range in @xmath0 is required to control the factorisation in a hard , pertubatively calculable amplitude and a soft amplitude which is parametrized by the generalized parton distributions @xmath9 .",
    "the gpds depend on three kinematical variables : @xmath10 and @xmath11 parameterize the longitudinal momentum fractions of the partons , while @xmath12 relates to the transverse momentum transfer .",
    "since the theoretical proof of factorization assumes that the transfer @xmath12 is finite ( that is @xmath13 )  @xcite , we consider in the following @xmath14 smaller than 1 gev@xmath3 .",
    "another condition of factorization concerns the helicity of the virtual photon . in case of hard exclusive meson production",
    "it is mandatory to impose that the virtual photon be longitudinal in order to select the perturbative gluon exchange .",
    "experimentally we should consider rosenbluth separation for @xmath6 production , while for @xmath5 production we can select longitudinal @xmath5s through the angular distribution of the decay products and assume the s - channel helecity conservation .",
    "hard exclusive meson productions seem more complex to analyze as they contain non perturbative information on both the target and the produced meson .",
    "nevertheless they offer the possibility to disentangle different gpds ( vector meson production depends on @xmath15 and @xmath16 only ; pseudo - scalar production depends on @xmath17 and @xmath18 only ) and to separate contributions from different flavors . forward",

    "no measurement has been done at @xmath1 larger than 0.05 .",
    "thanks to the expertise of the nmc collaboration for these absolute measurements we will explore a larger domain in @xmath1 , @xmath0 and @xmath12 with the muon beam available at cern .",

    "[ cross - section ] with @xmath21 = 100 gev and same values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 as above ) , the interference between bh and dvcs becomes large and offers a unique opportunity to study compton scattering amplitude including its phase .",
    "a careful analysis of the dependence of the cross section on the azimuthal angle @xmath24 between the leptonic and hadronic planes and on @xmath0 allows one to disentangle higher - twist effects and to select the real or imaginary parts of the dvcs amplitude ( see the details in the previous text of m. diehl  @xcite ) .",
    "if a longitudinally polarized lepton beam and an unpolarized target are used , the angular analysis and the @xmath0 dependence of the cross section difference @xmath25 allow one to select the imaginary part of the dvcs amplitude and thus the gpds at the specific values @xmath26 .",
    "this study is being investigated at hermes  @xcite and jlab  @xcite . if two muon beams of opposite charge and polarization are used , the angular analysis and the @xmath0 dependence of the sum of cross sections @xmath27 allow also one to select the imaginary part of the dvcs amplitude .",
    "moreover the same method applied to the difference of cross sections @xmath28 allows one to select the real part of the dvcs amplitude which , for a given @xmath11 , is sensitive to the complete dependence on @xmath10 of the gpds .",
    "the deconvolution ( over @xmath10 ) of this formula to extract the gpds is not yet clearly solved , but comparison to model predictions can easily be made .",
    "it is clear that the muon beam of high energy at cern can offer many possibilities in order to investigate the many - faceted problem of the gpds knowledge .",
    "figure [ azymuth ] shows the azimuthal distribution of the charge asymmetry which can be measured at compass and the strong sensitivity to two different models  @xcite . the first one is based on a simple parametrization of the gpds : @xmath29 where @xmath30 represents the elastic dirac form factor for the quark flavor @xmath31 in the nucleon . the second one  @xcite relies on the fact that the gpds measure the contribution of quarks with longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath10 to the corresponding form factor as is suggested by the sum rule : @xmath32 as one can associate the fourier transform of form factors with charge distributions in position space , one can expect that the gpds contain information about the distribution of partons in transverse position space . in fact it has been demonstrated that , when @xmath12 is purely transverse which amounts to @xmath33 , then @xmath34 is the fourier transform of the probability density to find a quark with momentum fraction @xmath10 at a given distance from the center of momentum in the transverse plane .",
    "qualitatively one expects that quarks with a large @xmath10 come essentially from the small valence  core  \" of the nucleon , while the small @xmath10 region should receive contributions from the much wider meson  cloud  \" .",
    "therefore one expects a gradual increase of the @xmath12-dependence of @xmath34 as one goes from larger to smaller values of @xmath10 .",
    "this suggests the parametrization : @xmath35 where @xmath36 represents the increase of the nucleon transverse size with energy .",
    "the domain of small @xmath1 reached at compass is related to the observation of see quarks or meson  cloud  \" or also gluons and it provides a large sensitivity to this three - dimensional picture of partons inside a hadron .",
    "the highest luminosity reachable at compass is required to investigate these exclusive measurements .",
    "the experiment will use 100 - 190 gev / c muons from the m2 beam line .",
    "limits on radio - protection in the experimental hall imply that the maximum flux of muon to be expected is of @xmath37 muons per sps spill ( 5.2s spill duration , repetition each 16.8s ) . under these circumstances",
    ", we can reach a luminosity of @xmath38 @xmath39s@xmath40 with the present polarized @xmath41lid or nh@xmath42 target of 1.2 meter long , and only @xmath43 @xmath39s@xmath40 with a future liquid hydrogen target of 2.5 meter long .    in order to get useful cross sections with positive and negative muon beams ,",
    "it is necessary to perform a precise absolute luminosity measurement .",
    "this has already been achieved by the nmc collaboration within a 1% accuracy  @xcite .",
    "the integrated muon flux was measured continuously by two methods : either by sampling the beam with a random trigger ( provided by the @xmath44 emitter am@xmath45 ) or by sampling the counts recorded in 2 scintillators hodoscope planes used to determine incident beam tracks .",
    "the beam tracks were recorded off - line , in the same way as the scattered muon tracks to determine exactly the integrated usable muon flux .    moreover @xmath46 and @xmath47 beams of 100 gev energy , with the same and as large as possible intensity as well as exactly opposite polarization ( to a few % ) are required .",
    "the muons are provided by pion and kaon decay and are naturally polarized .",
    "the pions and kaons come from the collision of the sps 400 gev proton beam on a be primary target .",
    "a solution was proposed by lau gatignon  @xcite .",
    "it consists in : 1 ) selecting 110 gev pion beams from the collision and 100 gev muon beams after the decay section in order to maximize the muon flux ; 2 ) keeping constant the collimator settings which define the pion and muon momentum spreads ( both the collimator settings in the hadron decay section and the scrapper settings in the muon cleaning section ) in order to fix the @xmath46 and @xmath47 polarizations at exactly the opposite value ( @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) ; 3 ) fixing @xmath50 to @xmath37 @xmath51 per sps spill with the longest 500 mm be primary target ; 4 ) using a shorter target to find @xmath52 close to @xmath37 @xmath51 per sps spill .",
    "this paragraph presents the experimental procedure to select the exclusive hemp or dvcs channel and the difference equipments that are required .",
    "they are mostly part of the existing high resolution compass spectrometer : muon detection which insures a good resolution in @xmath1 and @xmath0 , meson detection and identification in rich or photon detection in calorimeters of good energy and position resolutions to allow two photons separation .",
    "the compass spectrometer intercepts only forward outgoing particles ( until 10 degrees ) and the photon or meson detection limits the experiment to small @xmath1 values ( @xmath53 ) . at these high energies the complete final state , including the low energy recoiling proton ,",
    "needs to be detected because missing mass techniques are not efficient due to the experimental resolutions ( the resolution in missing mass which is required is @xmath54 gev@xmath3 and the experimental resolution which can be achieved is larger than 1 gev@xmath3 ) .",
    "consequently the high resolution compass spectrometer needs to be completed by a recoil detector to measure precisely the proton momentum and exclude other reactions under high luminosity conditions . in the next section",
    "we will try to by - pass the necessity of a recoil detector to investigate the cleanest channel : @xmath55 where @xmath5s are identified through their decay in two charged pions accurately measured in the forward compass spectrometer .",
    "with the present compass setup we can undertake hard exclusive @xmath5 production ( with the largest cross section ) as we can benefit of the good expertise for this measurement in the previous nmc and smc experiments and so take the advantage to produce data in this field as soon as possible . at the same time we can also investigate hard exclusive @xmath6 production to see the limit of this setup .    in this context",
    "the constraints and limits of these experiments are the following ones : + 1 ) with the present polarized @xmath41lid or nh@xmath42 target the production occurs on quasi - free nucleons in the nucleus or in the coherent scattering on the nucleus .",
    "+ 2 ) luminosity determination is needed , but can be realized indirectly by measuring at the same time unpolarized deep inelastic scattering and using known or calculated structure functions @xmath56 and @xmath57 ( the `` emc '' nuclear effects have to be taken into account ) .",
    "+ 3 ) the selection of longitudinal @xmath5 will be made by the angular distribution of the decay product .",
    "no rosenbluth separation is envisageable for @xmath6 production .",
    "+ 4 ) the absence of a recoil detector prevents the complete exclusivity of the channel .",
    "precise simulations of exclusive @xmath5 and @xmath6 production have been performed  @xcite and were already presented at the compass meeting in munich in 2000 . the selection of exclusive events can be summarized as follows : + 1 ) deep inelastic events are selected by cuts on variables depending on the scattered muon kinematics : + @xmath58 and @xmath59 gev for @xmath5 + @xmath60 and @xmath61 gev for @xmath6 + the values outside(inside ) the brackets correspond to the beam energy of 190(100 ) gev .",

    "it is then required that each pion decay is emitted in the laboratory at an angle smaller than 180 mrad ( the acceptance limit of the forward spectrometer ) and its momentum is above 2 gev .",
    "for @xmath6 it is demanded that each decay photon has energy above 2 gev and enters either electromagnetic calorimeter ecal1 or ecal2 .",

    "defining the exclusive sample the amount of the residual non - exclusive background for the smc experiment was up to about 10% at large @xmath0 .",
    "+ 4 ) finally for the @xmath5 channel a cut on the invariant mass of the two pions can be applied in order to reduce the non - resonant background . for the smc sample the invariant mass distribution after selections , including the cut on inelasticity ,",

    "<S> this paper presents the reactions which can be performed at compass to study the generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) . the high energy muon beam at cern allows to measure hard exclusive meson production or deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) in the bjorken regime in a large range of @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( 1.5 @xmath2 7.5 gev@xmath3 and 0.03 @xmath4 0.25 ) . </S>",
    "<S> exploratory measurements dedicated to @xmath5 or @xmath6 production can be investigated with the present setup . </S>",
    "<S> dvcs measurement require an upgrade of the compass setup . </S>"
