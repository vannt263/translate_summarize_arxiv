    "euclidean geometry , as presented by euclid , consists of straightedge - and - compass constructions and rigorous reasoning about the results of those constructions .",
    "tarski s twentieth - century axiomatization of geometry does not bear any direct relation to ruler and compass constructions . here",
    "we present modifications of tarski s theory whose axioms correspond more closely to straightedge - and - compass constructions .",
    "these theories can be considered either with intuitionistic ( constructive ) logic , or with ordinary ( `` classical '' ) logic .",
    "both versions are of interest .    in @xcite",
    ", we gave an axiomatization of constructive geometry based on a version of hilbert s axioms ( which contain no essential non - constructivities ) .",
    "in @xcite , we obtained metamathematical results about constructive geometry , and showed that those results do not depend on the details of the axiomatization . in this paper , we focus on formulating constructive geometry in the language and style that tarski used for his well - known axiomatization of geometry .",
    "what is striking about tarski s theory is its use of only one sort of variables , for points , and the small number of axioms .",
    "here we give what may be the shortest possible axiomatization of constructive geometry , following tarski s example .    in @xcite",
    ", we discussed euclidean constructive geometry in general terms , and worked informally with a theory that had three sorts of variables for points , lines , and circles . here , in the spirit of tarski , we work with a one - sorted theory , with variables for points only . in order to provide terms for points proved to exist , we need some function symbols .",
    "tarski s axioms have existential quantifiers ; we are interested ( both classically and constructively ) in extensions of the language that provide function symbols to construct points .",
    "three of these symbols are skolem symbols that correspond immediately to ruler and compass constructions : one for extending a segment @xmath0 by another segment @xmath1 , and two for the intersection points of a line and circle .",
    "( in our previous work we also had function symbols for the intersection points of two circles ; here we will prove that these are not needed , as the intersection points of two circles are already constructible . ) then we need a way to construct certain intersection points of two lines .",
    "such points are proved to exist by versions of pasch s axiom ; so one obvious approach is just to provide a skolem symbol for a suitable version of pasch s axiom .",
    "( this has been done for decades by people using theorem - provers with tarski s axioms . )",
    "however , tarski s version of pasch s axiom allows `` degenerate cases '' in which the `` triangle '' collapses to three points on a line , or the line through the triangle coincides with a side of the triangle . in these cases ,",
    "the point asserted to exist is not really constructed by intersecting two lines and does not correspond to a ruler and compass construction .",
    "therefore , even with classical logic , tarski s axioms need some modifications before they really correspond to ruler and compass constructions . to start with , we require that the points in pasch s axiom be not collinear",
    ". then we have to `` put back '' the two fundamental axioms about betweenness that tarski originally had , but which were eliminated when tarski and his students realized that they followed from the degenerate cases of pasch .",
    "finally , we have to restrict the segment - extension axiom to extending non - null segments , i.e.,@xmath0 with @xmath2 , since extending a null segment is not done by laying a straightedge between two points .",
    "more formally , the extension of segment @xmath0 by a non - null segment @xmath1 will not depend continuously on @xmath3 as @xmath3 approaches @xmath4 , while ruler and compass constructions should depend continuously on parameters .",
    "the resulting modification of tarski s classical axioms we call `` continuous tarski geometry '' .",
    "if we add the function symbols mentioned above , then all those function symbols correspond to ruler and compass constructions , and herbrand s theorem then tells us that if we can prove @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is quantifier - free , then there are finitely many ruler and compass constructions @xmath7 such that for each @xmath8 , one of the @xmath9 constructs @xmath10 such that @xmath11 .",
    "we said that ruler and compass constructions should depend continuously on parameters , but there is a problem about that : we need to distinguish axiomatically between the two intersection points of a line and a circle .",
    "since lines are given by two distinct points , our solution to this problem is to require that the two intersection points of @xmath12 and circle @xmath13 occur in the same order on @xmath14 as @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "thus if @xmath3 and @xmath4 are interchanged , the intersection points given by the two function symbols also are interchanged .",
    "all the changes discussed above make sense and are desirable even with classical logic .",
    "they connect the axioms of geometry with ruler and compass constructions and , in the case of pasch s axiom , with its intuitive justification .",
    "the degenerate cases of pasch have nothing to do with triangles and lines ; they are really about betweenness relations between points on a single line , so it is philosophically better to formulate the axioms as in continuous tarski geometry .",
    "having the smallest possible number of axioms is not necessarily the criterion for the best version of a theory .",
    "there is also an issue regarding the best form of the parallel axiom .",
    "historically , several versions have been considered for use with tarski s theories .",
    "two in particular are of interest : the axiom ( a10 ) that tarski eventually settled upon , and the `` triangle circumscription principle '' , which says that given three non - collinear points , there is a point @xmath15 equidistant from all three ( which is then the center of a circle containing the three points ) .",
    "classically , these two formulations are equivalent , so it is just a matter of personal preference which to take as an axiom .",
    "constructively , the two versions mentioned are also equivalent , as follows from the results of @xcite and this paper , but the proof is much lengthier than with classical logic .",
    "euclid s own formulation of the parallel postulate , `` euclid 5 '' , mentions angles , so it requires a reformulation to be expressed in the `` points only '' language of tarski s theory ; a points - only version of euclid 5 is given in @xcite and repeated below .",
    "in @xcite it is proved that euclid 5 is equivalent to the triangle circumscription principle , which is considerably shorter than euclid 5 .",
    "we follow szmielew in adopting the triangle circumscription principle as our parallel axiom , although our results show that we _",
    "could _ have retained tarski s version .",
    "there is also `` playfair s axiom '' , which is the version of the parallel axiom adopted by hilbert in @xcite .",
    "that version , unlike all the other versions , makes no existence assertion at all , but only asserts that there can not exist two different lines parallel to a given line through a given point .",
    "this version , making no existence assertion , appears to be constructively weaker than the others , and in @xcite , it is proved that this is indeed the case .",
    "our aim in this paper is a constructive version of tarski s geometry .",
    "the changes described above , however , make sense with classical logic and are the primary changes that allow a connection between proofs from tarski s axioms and ruler and compass constructions .",
    "if we still use classical logic , proofs in this theory yield a finite number of ruler and compass constructions , to be used in the different cases required in the proof . to make the theory constructive ,",
    "we do just two things more : ( 1 ) we use intuitionistic logic instead of classical logic , and ( 2 ) we add `` stability axioms '' , allowing us to prove equality or inequality of points by contradiction . the reasons for accepting the stability axioms are discussed in ",
    "[ section : stability ] below .",
    "it turns out that no more changes are needed .",
    "this theory is called `` intuitionistic tarski geometry '' . as in classical geometry",
    ", we can consider it with or without function symbols .    even though this theory is constructively acceptable",
    ", one might not like the fact that the skolem symbols are total , i.e.,they have _ some _ ( undetermined ) value even in `` undefined '' cases , where they do not actually correspond to ruler and compass constructions .",
    "therefore we also consider a version of tarski geometry in which the logic is further modified to use the `` logic of partial terms '' lpt , permitting the use of undefined terms . in this theory",
    ", we replace the skolem function for pasch s axiom by a more natural term @xmath16 for the intersection point of @xmath12 and @xmath17 .",
    "the main difference between constructive and classical geometry is that , in constructive geometry , one is not allowed to make a case distinction when proving that something exists .",
    "for example , to prove that there always exists a perpendicular to line @xmath14 through point @xmath8 , we may classically use two different constructions , one of which works when @xmath8 is not on @xmath14 ( a `` dropped perpendicular '' ) , and a different construction that works when @xmath8 is on @xmath14 ( an `` erected perpendicular '' ) . but constructively",
    ", we need a single construction ( a `` uniform perpendicular '' ) that handles both cases with one construction . in this paper",
    "we show that such uniform constructions can be found , using the tarski axioms , for perpendiculars , reflections , and rotations .",
    "then the methods of @xcite can be used to define addition and multiplication geometrically , as was done classically by descartes and hilbert .",
    "this shows that every model of the theory is a plane over a euclidean ordered field that can be explicitly constructed .",
    "having formulated intuitionistic tarski geometry , we then study its metamathematics . using two logical tools : the gdel double - negation interpretation , and cut - elimination .",
    "the double - negation interpretation is just a formal way of saying that , by pushing double negations inwards , we can convert a classical proof of a basic statement like equality of two points , or incidence of a point on a line , or a betweenness statement , to a constructive proof .",
    "( the same is of course not true for statements asserting that something exists . )",
    "this provides us with tools for the wholesale importation of certain types of theorems from the long and careful formal development from tarski s classical axioms in @xcite .",
    "but since we modified tarski s axioms , to make them correspond better to ruler and compass , some care is required in this metatheorem .",
    "cut - elimination provides us with the theorem that things proved to exist in intuitionistic tarski geometry can be constructed by ruler and compass .",
    "the point here is that they can be constructed by a _ uniform _ construction , i.e.,a single construction that works for all cases .",
    "we already mentioned the example of dropped and erected perpendiculars in classical geometry , versus a uniform perpendicular construction in constructive geometry . using cut - elimination",
    "we prove that this feature of constructive proofs , so evident from examples , is a necessary feature of any existence proof in intuitionistic tarski geometry : an existence proof _ always _ provides a uniform construction .    on the other hand",
    ", our version of tarski geometry with classical logic , which we call `` continuous tarski geometry '' , supports a similar theorem .",
    "if it proves @xmath5 , with @xmath6 quantifier - free , then there are a finite number ( not just one ) of ruler and compass constructions , given terms of the theory , such that for every @xmath8 , one of those constructions produces @xmath10 such that @xmath11 .",
    "readers not familiar with intuitionistic or constructive mathematics will find additional introductory material in ",
    "[ section : constructivity ] .",
    "i would like to thank marvin j.  greenberg and victor pambuccian for conversations and emails on this subject , and the anonymous referees for their detailed comments .",
    "it is not our purpose here to review in detail the ( long , complicated , and interesting ) history of axiomatic geometry , but some history is helpful in understanding the variety of geometrical axiom systems .",
    "we begin by mentioning the standard english translation of euclid @xcite and the beautiful commentary - free edition @xcite .",
    "euclid is the touchstone against which axiomatizations are measured .",
    "we restrict our attention to the two most famous axiomatizations , those of hilbert and tarski .",
    "previous work on constructive geometry is discussed in @xcite .",
    "hilbert s influential book @xcite used the notion of betweenness and the axioms for betweenness studied by pasch @xcite .",
    "hilbert s theory was what would today be called `` second - order '' , in that sets were freely used in the axioms .",
    "segments , for example , were defined as sets of two points , so by definition @xmath18 since the set @xmath19 does not depend on the order .",
    "of course , this is a trivial departure from first - order language ; but hilbert s last two axioms , archimedes s axiom and the continuity axiom , are not expressible in a first - order geometrical theory . on the other hand , lines and planes were regarded not as sets of points , but as ( what today would be called ) first - order objects , so incidence was an undefined relation , not set - theoretic membership .",
    "at the time ( 1899 ) the concept of first - order language had not yet been developed , and set theory was still fairly new .",
    "congruence was treated by hilbert as a binary relation on sets of two points , not as a 4-ary relation on points .",
    "early geometers thought that the purpose of axioms was to set down the truth about space , so as to ensure accurate and correct reasoning about the one true ( or as we now would say , `` intended '' ) model of those axioms .",
    "hilbert s book promoted the idea that axioms may have many models ; the axioms and deductions from them should make sense if we read `` tables , chairs , and beer mugs '' instead of `` points , lines , and planes . ''",
    "this is evident from the very first sentence of hilbert s book :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _   consider three distinct sets of objects .",
    "let the objects of the first set be called _ points _",
    "@xmath20 ; let the objects of the second set be called _ lines _",
    "@xmath20 ; let the objects of the third set be callled _ planes_. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    hilbert defines segments as pairs of points ( the endpoints ) , although lines are primitive objects . on the other hand ,",
    "a ray is the set of all points on the ray , and angles are sets consisting of two rays .",
    "so an angle is a set of sets of points .",
    "hence technically hilbert s theory , which is often described as second order , is at least third order .",
    "( we say `` technically '' , because it would not be difficult to reduce hilbert s theory to an equivalent theory that would really be second order . )",
    "hilbert s language has a congruence relation for segments , and a separate congruence relation for angles .",
    "hilbert s congruence axioms involve the concept of angles : his fourth congruence axiom involves `` angle transport '' ( constructing an angle on a given base equal to a given angle ) , and his fifth congruence axiom is the sas triangle congruence principle .",
    "hilbert s chapter vii discusses geometric constructions with a limited set of tools , a `` segment transporter '' and an `` angle transporter '' .",
    "these correspond to the betweenness and congruence axioms .",
    "hilbert does not discuss the special cases of line - circle continuity and circle - circle continuity axioms that correspond to ruler and compass constructions , despite the mention of `` compass '' in the section titles of chapter vii .",
    "hilbert s geometry contained two axioms that go beyond first - order logic .",
    "first , the axiom of archimedes ( which requires the notion of natural number ) , and second , an axiom of continuity , which ( rephrased in modern terms ) says that dedekind cuts are filled on any line .",
    "this axiom requires mentioning a set of points , so hilbert s theory with this axiom included is not a `` first - order theory '' in a language with variables only over points , lines , and circles .      later in the 20th century ,",
    "when the concept of `` first - order theory '' was widely understood , tarski formulated his theory of elementary geometry , in which hilbert s axiom of continuity was replaced with an axiom schemata .",
    "the set variable in the continuity axiom was replaced by any first - order formula .",
    "tarski proved that this theory ( unlike number theory ) is complete : every statement in the first - order language can be proved or refuted from tarski s axioms .",
    "in addition to being a first - order theory , tarski also made other simplifications .",
    "he realized that lines , angles , circles , segments , and rays could all be treated as auxiliary objects , merely enabling the construction of some new points from some given points .",
    "tarski s axioms are stated using only variables for points .",
    "he has only two relations : ( non - strict ) betweenness , `` @xmath4 is between @xmath3 and @xmath21 '' , and `` equidistance '' , @xmath22 , which means what euclid expressed as `` @xmath0 is congruent to segment @xmath1 '' .",
    "we abbreviate @xmath22 informally as @xmath23 .",
    "we have listed tarski s axioms for reference in  [ section : axioms ] of this paper , along with the axioms of our constructive version of tarski geometry , adhering to the numbering of @xcite , which has become standard .",
    "tarski replaced hilbert s fourth and fifth congruence axioms ( angle transport and sas ) with an elegant axiom , known as the five - segment axiom .",
    "this axiom is best understood not through its formal statement , but through fig .",
    "[ figure : tarskifivesegmentfigure ] .",
    "the 5-segment axiom says that in fig .",
    "[ figure : tarskifivesegmentfigure ] , the length of the dashed segment @xmath1 is determined by the lengths of the other four segments in the left - hand triangle .",
    "formally , if the four solid segments in the first triangle are pairwise congruent to the corresponding segments in the second triangle , then the dashed segments are also congruent .",
    "tarski s 5-segment axiom is a thinly - disguised variant of the sas criterion for triangle congruence . to see this , refer to the figure .",
    "the triangles we are to prove congruent are @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "we are given that @xmath26 is congruent to @xmath27 and @xmath28 is congruent to @xmath29 .",
    "the congruence of angles @xmath24 and @xmath25 is expressed in tarski s axiom by the congruence of triangles @xmath30 and @xmath31 , whose sides are pairwise equal . the conclusion , that @xmath1 is congruent to @xmath32 , give the congruence of triangles @xmath24 and @xmath25 . in chapter 11 of @xcite",
    ", one can find a formal proof of the sas criterion from the 5-segment axiom .",
    "borsuk - szmielew also took this as an axiom ( see @xcite , p. 81 , axiom c-5 ) .",
    "an earlier version of tarski s theory included as an axiom the `` triangle construction theorem '' , which says that if we are given triangle @xmath33 , and segment @xmath34 congruent to @xmath0 , and a point @xmath8 not on @xmath35 , then we can construct a point @xmath13 on the same side of @xmath35 as @xmath8 such that triangle @xmath36 is congruent to triangle @xmath33 .",
    "it was later realized that this axiom is provable .",
    "for example , one can drop a perpendicular from @xmath21 to @xmath12 , whose foot is the point @xmath37 on @xmath12 , and then find a corresponding point @xmath38 on @xmath35 , and then lay off @xmath39 on the perpendicular to @xmath35 at @xmath38 on the same side of @xmath35 as @xmath8 , ending in the desired point @xmath13 .",
    "of course one must check that this construction can be done and proved correct on the basis of the other axioms .",
    "but as it stands , this construction demands a case distinction about the order and possible identity of the points @xmath37 , @xmath3 , and @xmath21 on @xmath12 .",
    "hence , at least this proof of the triangle construction theorem from the axioms of tarski s theory is non - constructive .",
    "tarski s early axiom systems also included axioms about betweenness and congruence that were later shown @xcite to be superfluous . the final version of this theory appeared in @xcite ; for the full history see @xcite .",
    "the achievement of szmielew and gupta ( who are mainly responsible for part i of @xcite ) is to develop a really minimal set of axioms for betweenness and congruence .",
    "hilbert s intuitive axioms about betweenness disappeared , leaving only the axiom @xmath40 and the pasch axiom and axioms to guarantee that congruence is an equivalence relation .",
    "the ( strict ) betweenness relation is written @xmath41 .",
    "we read this `` @xmath4 is between @xmath3 and @xmath21 '' .",
    "the intended meaning is that that the three points are collinear and distinct , and @xmath4 is the middle one of the three .",
    "hilbert @xcite and greenberg @xcite use strict betweenness , as we do . tarski",
    "@xcite used non - strict betweenness .",
    "they all used the same letter @xmath42 for the betweenness relation , which is confusing .",
    "for clarity we always use @xmath42 for strict betweenness , and introduce @xmath43 for non - strict betweenness . since @xmath44 is tarski s initial , and he used non - strict betweenness , that should be a memory aid .",
    "the two notions are interdefinable ( even constructively ) :    [ defn : t ] non - strict betweenness is defined by @xmath45    in the other direction , @xmath41 can be defined as @xmath46 if we express @xmath41 in terms of @xmath43 , and then again express @xmath44 in terms of @xmath42 , we obtain a formula that is equivalent to the original using only axioms of classical propositional logic .",
    "we mention this point to emphasize that using these definitions , tarski could have taken either strict or non - strict betweenness as primitive .",
    "in fact , to show that these definitions are `` inverses '' in the sense mentioned , we need only intuitionistic logic plus the stability of equality and betweenness .",
    "therefore ( since we do accept stability of equality and betweenness ) , neither @xmath42 nor @xmath44 is inherently more constructive than the other .",
    "why then did tarski choose to use non - strict betweenness , when hilbert had used strict betweenness ?",
    "possibly , as suggested by @xcite , because this allowed him to both simplify the axioms , and reduce their number . by using @xmath44 instead of @xmath42 , the axioms cover various `` degenerate cases '' , when diagrams collapse onto lines , etc .",
    "some of these degenerate cases were useful . from the point of view of constructivity , however , this is not desirable .",
    "it renders tarski s axioms _ prima facie _ non - constructive ( as we will show below ) .",
    "therefore the inclusion of degenerate cases in the axioms is something that will need to be eliminated in making a constructive version of tarski s theories .",
    "the same is true even if our only aim is to connect the axioms with ruler and compass constructions , while retaining classical logic .",
    "we next want to give a constructive definition of collinearity .",
    "classically we would define this as @xmath47 .",
    "that would nt work as a constructive definition of collinearity , because we have no way to decide in general which alternative might hold , and the constructive meaning of disjunction would require it . in other words , we can know that @xmath48 lies on the line determined by distinct points @xmath3 and @xmath4 without knowing its order relations with @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "but we can find a classically equivalent ( yet constructively valid ) form by using the law that @xmath49 is equivalent to @xmath50 . by that method",
    "we arrive at    [ defn : collinearity ] @xmath51 is the formula expressing that @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath48 lie on a line .",
    "@xmath52 or equivalently , in terms of @xmath42 , @xmath53    informally , we use the notation @xmath12 to stand for the line determined by distinct points @xmath3 and @xmath4 , so `` @xmath21 lies on @xmath12 '' means @xmath54 .",
    "thus @xmath51 only expresses that @xmath48 lies on @xmath12 if we also specify @xmath2 .",
    "we do not put the condition @xmath55 into the definition of @xmath51 for two reasons : it would destroy the symmetry between the three arguments , and more important , it would cause confusion in comparing our work with the standard reference for tarski s theories , namely @xcite .",
    "hilbert s fourth betweenness axiom is often known as pasch s axiom , because it was first studied by pasch in 1882 @xcite .",
    "it says that if line @xmath14 meets ( the interior of ) side @xmath34 of triangle @xmath36 then it meets ( the interior of ) side @xmath56 or side @xmath27 as well . but tarski considered instead , two restricted versions of pasch s axioms known as `` inner pasch '' and `` outer pasch '' , illustrated in fig .  [",
    "figure : innerouterpaschfigure ] .",
    "outer pasch was an axiom ( instead of , not in addition to , inner pasch ) in versions of tarski s theories until 1965 , when it was proved from inner pasch in gupta s thesis @xcite , theorem 3.70 , or satz 9.6 in @xcite .",
    "outer pasch appears as satz 9.6 in @xcite .",
    "the proof given in @xcite , applied to the formulation of outer pasch with strict betweenness , is constructive .",
    "the proof is complicated , however , in that it depends on the ability to drop a perpendicular to a line from a point not on the line . as we shall discuss extensively , proving the existence of such perpendiculars is problematic : easy constructions require either line - circle continuity or the parallel axiom , and only with gupta s complicated proof do we have dropped perpendiculars without either of those assumptions . in  [ section : doublenegation ]",
    "we shall show how to use the double - negation interpretation ( a metamathematical tool developed by gdel ) to ensure the constructivity of the proof of outer pasch without checking it line by line .",
    "the unsatisfied reader has the choice to either check the proof directly , or look ahead to  [ section : doublenegation ] , which does not depend on the intervening material .",
    "we will use outer pasch as needed .",
    "after gupta proved outer pasch from inner , szmielew chose to take inner pasch as an axiom instead of outer pasch , although a footnote in @xcite shows that tarski disagreed with that choice ( on grounds of how easy or difficult it is to deduce other things ) .",
    "gupta s thesis also contains a proof that outer pasch implies inner pasch .",
    "it is not completely clear why tarski wanted to restrict pasch s axiom in the first place , but two good reasons come to mind .",
    "first , the restricted forms are valid even in three - dimensional space , so they do not make an implicit dimensional assertion , as the unrestricted pasch axiom does ( it fails in three - space ) .",
    "second , there is the simpler logical form of inner ( or outer ) pasch : unrestricted pasch needs either a disjunction , or a universal quantifier in the hypothesis , so the condition to be satisfied by the point whose existence is asserted is not quantifier - free and disjunction - free , as it is with inner and outer pasch .",
    "this simplicity of logical form is important for our purposes in constructive geometry , but for tarski it may just have been a matter of `` elegance . ''",
    "the notions of `` same side '' and `` opposite side '' of a line will be needed below , and are also of interest in comparing hilbert s and tarski s geometries .",
    "one of hilbert s axioms was the _ plane separation axiom _ , according to which a line separates a plane into ( exactly ) two regions .",
    "two points @xmath3 and @xmath4 not on line @xmath14 are on opposite sides of @xmath14 if @xmath2 and there is a point of @xmath14 between @xmath3 and @xmath4 , i.e. , the segment @xmath0 meets @xmath14 .",
    "[ definition : oppositesides ] @xmath57    of course , in tarski geometry , we can not mention lines directly , so @xmath14 has to be replaced by two distinct points , yielding a 4-ary relation .",
    "the definition of being on the same side is less straightforward .",
    "hilbert s definition of @xmath58 was that segment @xmath0 does not meet @xmath14 . that involves a universal quantifier : @xmath59 one can get an existential quantifier instead of a universal quantifier by using tarski s definition , illustrated in fig .  [",

    "the letter mentions equivalent versions of the parallel axiom : the two mentioned above and a `` third version of the parallel axiom '' , which says that if one connects the midpoints of two sides of a triangle , the connecting segment is congruent to half the third side . in spite of the name `` third version of the parallel axiom '' , the letter makes no claim that the different versions are equivalent ( in any theory at all ) .",

    "but no such thing is true in the theories considered here , which have only line - circle and circle - circle continuity ( one as an axiom , and one as a theorem ) .",
    "indeed , the `` third version '' mentioned above ( which we here call @xmath68 , for `` midline '' ) is not equivalent to the parallel postulate ( in neutral geometry with line - circle and circle - circle continuity ) , but instead to the weaker assertion that the sum of the angles of every triangle is equal to two right angles .",
    "the non - equivalence with the parallel axiom is proved as follows :    [ theorem : munprovable ] no quantifier - free statement can be equivalent to the parallel axiom in neutral geometry with circle - circle and line - circle continuity .    _",
    "proof_. we give a model of neutral geometry in which @xmath68 ( or any quantifier - free formula that is provable with the aid of the parallel axiom ) holds , but the parallel axiom fails .",

    "yet , @xmath70 is not a euclidean plane ; let @xmath14 be the @xmath8-axis and let @xmath75 be an infinitesimal .",
    "there are many lines through @xmath76 that are parallel to @xmath14 in @xmath70 ( all but one of them are restrictions to @xmath77 of lines in @xmath78 that meet the @xmath8-axis at some non finitely bounded point ) . that completes the proof .",
    "_ discussion_. as remarked above , it follows from szmielew s work @xcite , p.  51",
    ", that @xmath68 is equivalent to the parallel axiom in tarki s geometry with classical logic and the full first - order continuity axiom ( a11 ) .",
    "the question then arises , how exactly can we use elementary continuity to prove euclid 5 from @xmath68 ? here is a proof : assume , for proof by contradiction , the negation of euclid 5 .",
    "then , by elementary continuity , limiting parallels exist ( see @xcite , p. 261 ) .",
    "then aristotle s axiom holds , as proved in @xcite , prop .",

    "that is , of course , also true of the proof via szmielew s metamathematics .",
    "note that a non - quantifier - free instance of elementary continuity is needed to get the existence of limiting parallels directly ; in the presence of aristotle s axiom , line - circle continuity suffices ( see @xcite , p. 258 ) , but aristotle s axiom does not hold in @xmath77 .",
    "finally , the proof of theorem  [ theorem : munprovable ] shows that the use of a non - quantifier - free instance of continuity is essential , since quantifier - free instances will hold in dehn s model ( just like line - circle and circle - circle continuity ) .",

    "some details of the tarskian theory of angles are discussed in  [ section : angles ] below ; the upshot is that ( even constructively ) one can construct a conservative extension of tarski geometry that has variables for angles and directly supports the kind of arguments one finds in euclid .",

    "[ figure : alternateinterioranglesfigure ] , we show how to translate the concept `` equal alternating interior angles '' into tarski s language .",
    "tarski s theory is `` elementary '' only in the sense that it is first - order .",
    "it still goes far beyond euclid . to capture euclid s geometry ,",
    "tarski considered the subtheory in which the continuity axiom is replaced by `` segment - circle continuity '' .",

    "tarski s version of inner pasch allows the points @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath21 to be collinear , and this case is technically important , because it allows a number of fundamental theorems about betweenness to be derived that originally were taken as axioms .. ] the point asserted to exist is unique when @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath21 are not collinear ; the technical question arises , whether the point can be chosen continuously in the five parameters @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath21 , @xmath48 , and @xmath62 , in case collinearity is allowed , but the five points are required to be distinct . some computations ( not provided here ) show that indeed the point can be continuously chosen .",
    "nevertheless , we consider the case when @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath21 are collinear to be objectionable , on philosophical grounds .",
    "pasch s axiom is supposed to justify the construction of certain points by labeling the intersections of lines drawn with a straightedge as actually `` existing '' points . in the case",
    "when the lines coincide , the axiom has no conceptual connection with the idea of intersecting lines , and hence would need some other justification to be accepted as an axiom .",
    "if the justification is just that it provides a single axiom from which several intuitively evident propositions about betweenness can be deduced , that is a distortion of the meaning of the word `` axiom . ''",
    "whether or not one gives weight to this philosophical argument , there is a related technical point : we consider below a version of geometry with terms for the intersection points of lines , and we want to be able to use those terms to construct the points shown to exist by pasch s axiom . in other words , the problem with tarski s too - general version of inner pasch is that it asserts the existence of points for which there is no ruler and compass construction . in that respect , it is unlike any of the other axioms ( a1 ) to ( a10 ) , and also unlike the line - circle and circle - circle continuity axioms .",
    "this issue reflects in a precise mathematical way the philosophical issue about the collinear case of pasch s axiom .",
    "therefore , we reformulate inner pasch for continuity , and for constructivity in the sense of ruler and compass constructions of the points asserted to exist , as follows :    * we change @xmath147 to @xmath148 .",
    "* we add the hypothesis , @xmath149 .",
    "the resulting axiom is    @xmath189 & + @xmath155 & ( a7-i ) strict inner pasch +    note that we did not require both @xmath148 and @xmath190 .",
    "changing just one of those from @xmath44 to @xmath42 is sufficient to allow a ruler and compass construction .",
    "we do not need two versions , one with @xmath148 and one with @xmath190 , by symmetry . as it turns out",
    ", we could use @xmath42 instead of @xmath44 in all the parts of this axiom and prove the same theorems , as is shown in section  [ section : meta ] below .",
    "tarski s final theory @xcite had only one betweenness axiom , known as ( a6 ) or `` the identity axiom for betweenness '' : @xmath191 in terms of strict betweenness , that becomes @xmath192 , or otherwise expressed , @xmath193 .",
    "we also refer to this axiom as ( a6 ) . the original version of tarski s theory had more betweenness axioms ( see @xcite , p. 188 ) .",
    "these were all shown eventually to be superfluous in classical tarski geometry , through the work of eva kallin , scott taylor , tarski himself , and especially tarski s student h.  n.  gupta @xcite .",

    "if one introduces skolem functions for the intersection points of two circles , then those skolem functions can be interpreted quite arbitrarily , unless one also adds further axioms to guarantee their continuity , and even then , one has a problem because those skolem functions will be meaningless ( have arbitrary values ) when the circles do not intersect .",
    "tarski did not have circle - circle continuity , but the same problem arises with skolem functions for inner pasch , when the hypotheses are not satisfied .    the problem can be seen in a simpler context , when we try to axiomatize field theory with a function symbol @xmath231 , the official version of @xmath232 .",

    "we return below to the question of how this works for intuitionistic theories in lemma  [ lemma : conservativeskolem ] below .",
    "papers on axiomatic geometry often use the phrase `` constructive theory '' to mean one with enough function symbols to be formulated with quantifier - free axioms .",
    "while this is not sufficient to imply that a theory is `` constructive '' in the sense of being in accordance with bishop s constructive mathematics ( or another branch of constructive mathematics ) , it is a desirable feature , in the sense that a constructive theory should provide terms to describe the objects it can prove to exist . in finding a constructive version of tarski s theories , therefore , we will wish to produce a version with function symbols corresponding to ruler and compass constructions . in order to compare the constructive theory with tarski s classical theory , we will first consider a skolemized version of tarski s theory , with classical logic",
    ".      one introduces skolem functions and reformulates the axioms to be quantifier - free .",
    "but we want these skolem functions to be meaningful as ruler and compass constructions",
    ". hence , we do not skolemize tarski s theory as he gave it , but rather the modified version we called `` continuous tarski geometry . ''",
    "the axioms are listed for reference in  [ section : axioms ] ; here we just give a list of the skolem functions :    * @xmath237 is a point @xmath8 such that for @xmath55 , we have @xmath238 . * @xmath168 is the point asserted to exist by inner pasch ( see fig  [ figure : innerouterpaschfigure ] ) , provided @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath21 are not collinear , and @xmath148 . * three constants @xmath66 , @xmath239 , and @xmath240 for three non - collinear points .",

    "@xmath241 and @xmath242 for the two intersection points of @xmath12 and @xmath119 , the circle with center @xmath21 passing through @xmath37 .",
    "the function @xmath243 is needed to remove the existential quantifier in szmielew s parallel axiom ( a@xmath244 ) , which says that if @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath21 are not collinear , there exists a circle through @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath21 . for the version ( a10 ) of the parallel axiom used in @xcite , we would need two different skolem functions .",
    "the points asserted to exist by that version are not unique and do not correspond to any natural ruler and compass construction , which is a reason to prefer triangle circumscription as the parallel axiom .",
    "the question arises , what do we do about `` undefined terms '' , e.g. , @xmath241 when the line and circle in question do not actually meet ?",
    "one approach is to modify the logic , using the `` logic of partial terms '' , introducing a new atomic statement @xmath245 ( read `` @xmath75 is defined '' ) for each term @xmath75 . in tarski s geometry",
    "as described here , that is not necessary , since we can explicitly give the conditions for each term to be defined . in that way",

    "in addition to the obvious `` skolem axioms '' involving these function symbols , we need additional axioms to ensure that the two intersection points of a line and circle are distinguished from each other ( except when the intersection is of a circle and a tangent line ) , and that the intersection points depend continuously on the ( points determining the ) lines and circles .",
    "we discuss the two points of intersection of @xmath12 and @xmath119 , which are denoted by @xmath241 and @xmath242 .",
    "we want an axiom asserting that these two points occur on @xmath12 in the same order as @xmath3 and @xmath4 do ; that axiom serves to distinguish the two points and ensure that they depend continuously on @xmath248 , and @xmath37 . to that end we need to define @xmath249 , assuming @xmath2 but allowing @xmath250 .",
    "this can be done as follows : @xmath251 the axiom in question is then @xmath252      we will investigate what additional axioms are necessary to guarantee that the skolem functions are uniquely defined and continuous .",
    "unless we are using the logic of partial terms , technically skolem functions are total , in which case we can not avoid some arbitrariness in their values , but when their `` definedness conditions '' given above are satisfied , we expect them to be uniquely defined and continuous",
    ". this will be important for metatheorems about the continuous dependence on parameters of things proved constructively to exist ; but we think it is also of interest even to the classical geometer .    evidently for this purpose we should use the version of the axioms that has been sanitized of degenerate cases .",
    "thus , @xmath253 only skolemizes axiom ( a4-i ) , for extending non - degenerate segments , and @xmath254 only skolemizes axiom ( a7-i ) rather than a7 .",
    "these skolem functions will then be uniquely defined ( and provably so ) .",

    "what happens when that requirement is relaxed ?",
    "if @xmath3 and @xmath4 are allowed to approach each other without restriction on the direction of approach , then @xmath144 does not depend continuously on its parameters .",

    "finally we are ready to move from classical to intuitionistic logic .",
    "our plan is to give two intuitionistic versions of tarski s theory , one with function symbols as in the skolemized version above , and one with existential axioms as in tarski s original theory",
    ". the underlying logic will be intuitionistic predicate logic .",
    "we first give the specifically intuitionistic parts of our theory , which are very few in number .",
    "we do not adopt decidable equality ( @xmath266 ) , nor even the substitute concept of `` apartness '' introduced by brouwer and heyting ( and discussed below ) , primarily because we aim to develop a system in which definable terms ( constructions ) denote continuous functions , but also because we wish to keep our system closely related to euclid s geometry , which contains nothing like apartness .      here",
    "we discuss some issues particular to geometry with intuitionistic logic .",
    "the main point is that we must avoid case distinctions in existence proofs .",
    "what one has to avoid in constructive geometry is not proofs of equality or inequality by contradiction , but rather constructions ( existence proofs ) that make a case distinction .",
    "for example , classically we have two different constructions of a perpendicular through point @xmath48 to line @xmath14 , one for when @xmath48 is not on @xmath14 , and another for when @xmath48 is on @xmath14 . pushing a double negation through an implication",
    ", we only get not - not a perpendicular exists , which is not enough .",
    "to constructivize the theorem , we have to give a uniform construction of the perpendicular , which works without a case distinction .",
    "( two different such constructions are given in this paper , one using line - circle continuity , but not the parallel axiom , and one using the parallel axiom , but not line - circle . )    in particular , in order to show that the models of geometry are planes over euclidean fields , we need to define addition and multiplication by just such uniform constructions , without case distinctions about the sign of the arguments .",
    "the classical definitions due to descartes and hilbert do depend on such case distinctions ; in @xcite we have given uniform definitions ; here we check that their properties can be proved in intuitionistic tarski geometry .",
    "to actually carry out the complete development directly would be a project of about the length and scope of szmielew s comparable development of classical geometry from tarski s axioms , in part i of @xcite .",
    "therefore it is important that the double - negation interpretation can be made to carry the load .",
    "we mention here two principles which are not accepted by all constructivists , at least in the context of real analysis . here",
    "@xmath267 refers to points on a fixed line @xmath14 , and can be defined in terms of betweenness .",
    "@xmath268 & ( markov s principle ) + @xmath269 & ( two - sides )    we accept the former , but not the latter .",
    "markov s principle follows from the stability of betweenness and is a fundamental principle of constructive geometry .",
    "it allows us to avoid distinguishing more than one sense of inequality between points .",
    "geometry without it would be much more complicated .",
    "the principle `` two - sides '' ( which we do not accept ) is closely related to `` a point not on a given line is on one side or the other of the line '' .",
    "( here the `` line '' could be the @xmath10-axis , i.e.,a line perpendicular to @xmath14 at the point 0 . )",
    "this principle is not needed in the formalization of euclid , or the development of the geometrical theory of arithmetic , and as we will show , it is not a theorem of intuitionistic tarski geometry .",
    "one might consider adopting two - sides as an axiom , on grounds similar to those sometimes used to justify markov s principle or apartness , namely that if we `` compute @xmath8 to sufficient accuracy we will see what sign it has . ''",
    "that justification applies only to the model of computable reals , not to various more general intuitionistic models of sequences generated by free choices of approximations to points .",
    "brouwer argued against this principle in one of his later papers @xcite on those grounds ; and our development of constructive geometry shows that it is not needed for the usual theorems , including the geometric definitions of addition and multiplication . in our opinion , not only is it unnecessary , it is also constructively undesirable , as the choice of which disjunct holds can not depend continuously on @xmath8 , so anyone claiming its validity must make some assumptions about how points are `` given '' , e.g. by a computable sequence of rational approximations ; we do not want to make such assumptions .    on the other hand , the following principle _ has _ been accepted by all constructivists in the past who considered geometry :    @xmath270 & ( apartness )    it turns out that apartness is completely unnecessary for the formalization of euclid , and is not a theorem of intuitionistic tarski geometry .",
    "the desire to use apartness probably arose from an unwillingness to the trichotomy law of order , and to find some replacement for it .",
    "in our work , the law of trichotomy of order is replaced by the stability of equality and betweenness .",
    "if we want to formalize one of euclid s proofs where two points are proved equal by contradiction ( consider iii.4 for a specific example ) , the proof in euclid shows @xmath271 ; in other words @xmath272 .",
    "what we need to formalize such proofs is the principle @xmath273 or , otherwise expressed , @xmath274 .",
    "this principle , already mentioned in the introduction , is called the `` stability of equality . ''",
    "the trichotomy law can also be double negated , each case but one shown contradictory , and the final double negation removed by the stability of betweenness , @xmath161 .",
    "that is the fundamental reason why apartness is not needed in constructive geometry .",
    "the word `` stable '' is applied to a predicate @xmath275 if @xmath276 .",
    "our intuitionistic versions of tarski geometry will all have axioms of stability for the basic predicates .",
    "that is , we include the axioms @xmath277 in this section we justify accepting these axioms .",
    "our intuition is that there is nothing asserting existence in the meaning of equality , congruence , or betweenness ; hence assertions of equality , congruence , or betweenness can be constructively proved by contradiction .",
    "there are many examples in euclid where euclid argues that two points , differently constructed , must coincide ; such examples use the stability of equality . similarly ,",
    "if point @xmath8 lies on @xmath12 , we may wish to argue by cases as to its position on the line relative to @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "we double - negate the disjunction of the five possible positions , argue each case independently , and arrive at the double negation of the desired conclusion . as long as what we are proving is a betweenness , congruence , or equality , stability allows us to remove the double negation and reach the desired conclusion .",
    "we explain this point with more detail , for those inexperienced with intuitionistic reasoning : suppose @xmath278 , and @xmath279 .",
    "then @xmath280 ( both classically and intuitionistically ) .",
    "taking @xmath281 to be @xmath282 , if @xmath278 and @xmath283 , then @xmath284 .",
    "so , classically , @xmath275 holds .",
    "but intuitionistically , we may not be able to prove that the cases @xmath77 and @xmath282 are exhaustive ; for example we can not assert in general that point @xmath48 is on line @xmath14 or it is not . but",
    "intuitionistically , we still have @xmath285 , since if @xmath286 then @xmath282 and @xmath287 , which is contradictory . now",
    "if @xmath275 is stable we can still conclude @xmath275 , since @xmath288 is intuitionistically valid .",
    "what we are not allowed to do , constructively , is argue by cases for an existential conclusion , using a different construction for each case .",
    "( in the previous paragraph , if @xmath275 begins with @xmath289 , then @xmath275 will not be stable . )",
    "this observation makes it apparent why the constructivization of geometry hinges on the successful discovery of _ uniform _ constructions , continuous in parameters .",
    "as we mentioned above , angles can be defined in tarski s theory , and one can show that the equality and ordering of angles is stable .",
    "that is , @xmath290 for angles @xmath66 and @xmath239 .",
    "thus , when euclid wants to prove @xmath291 , and says , if not , then one of them is greater ; let @xmath292 , and so on , the reasoning is constructive , because we have @xmath293 and if @xmath294 and @xmath295 lead to contradictions , then @xmath296 , whence by stability , @xmath291 .",
    "similarly if what is to be proved is an inequality of angles .",
    "julien narboux pointed out that the stability of equality can be derived from the stability of congruence :    [ lemma : stability2981 ] with the aid of axioms a1 and a3 , stability of congruence implies stability of equality .    _",

    "proof_. consider a skolem symbol with axiom @xmath312 , skolemizing the axiom @xmath311 .",
    "the corresponding lemma for classical theories needs no restriction on the form of @xmath77 ; one simply shows that every model of the theory without skolem functions can be expanded to a model of the theory with skolem functions .",
    "the interpretation of the values of a skolem symbol , say @xmath313 are just taken arbitrarily when @xmath314 is not satisfied .",

    "the simpler construction using line - circle continuity is adequate for most of our purposes .",

    ".      terms of tarski geometry ( intuitionistic or continuous , which has classical logic ) correspond to ( certain ) ruler and compass constructions ; in effect , to constructions in which you can form the intersection of lines that must intersect by inner pasch , and intersections of lines and circles . since inner pasch implies outer pasch ( in the presence of other axioms ) the points formed by outer pasch are also given by terms ; of course those terms will involve the complicated constructions of gupta s perpendiculars .",
    "that is , the skolem function for outer pasch , defined in terms of the skolem function for inner pasch , is very complicated .",
    "similarly , since circle - circle continuity is implied by line - circle continuity , then there must be terms for constructing those intersection points as well .",
    "but there is an issue to consider , in that the terms for erected and uniform perpendiculars have an extra parameter , a point not on the line ; and the radical axis construction also has an extra parameter for a point not on the center line .",
    "examination of those constructions reveals that if the `` extra '' point is changed to the other side of the line , then the `` head '' of the perpendicular changes sides too ; and in the radical axis construction , the result is that the two intersection points of the two circles switch places .",
    "if we then fix that choice once and for all by using lemma  [ lemma : pointnotonl ] , we can construct terms that give the two intersection points of two circles continuously . however , those terms will be complicated , because the term for constructing a point not on a line involves coordinates and cross products .    in previous",
    "work on constructive geometry , we had circle - circle continuity as an axiom , and built - in function symbols for the intersection points .",
    "it was a point of difficulty to distinguish the two , which we wanted to do by saying whether the triple of points from the center of one circle to the other center to the point of intersection was a `` right turn '' or a `` left turn '' .",
    "the concepts @xmath981 and @xmath982 had to be defined , either by a complicated set of axioms , or by introducing coordinates and using cross products as in @xcite . here",
    "we can recover those same terms , but now the coordinates and cross products are at least no longer in the axioms ! if we perform a complex conjugation ( i.e.,reflect in the @xmath8-axis ) then the two terms for the intersection points of two circles change places , exactly as in @xcite .",
    "if one wishes ( for example for connecting these theories to computer graphics ) to have explicit function symbols for circle - circle continuity , of course they can be conservatively added .",
    "we have exhibited a constructive version of tarski s euclidean geometry . because of the double - negation interpretation",
    ", it can prove at least some version of each classical theorem . using the uniform perpendicular , rotation , and reflection constructions given in this paper , it is possible ( by the methods of @xcite ) to give geometric definitions of addition and multiplication , without case distinctions as to the sign of the arguments , and proofs of their properties , so that coordinates in a euclidean field provably exist .",
    "hence the theory has not omitted anything essential . to achieve these results",
    ", we had to modify tarski s axioms to eliminate degenerate cases , and add back some former axioms that tarski had eliminated using those degenerate cases .",
    "even with classical logic , this theory now connects nicely with ruler - and- compass constructions , since each of the points asserted to exist can be constructed with ruler and compass .    by cut - elimination",
    ", things proved to exist ( under a negative hypothesis , as is always the case in euclid ) can be constructed , by a uniform straightedge - and - compass construction .",
    "even stronger , these constructions need not involve taking the intersections of arbitrary lines , but only those lines that have to intersect by the strong parallel axiom or inner pasch .    by contrast , in tarski s ( classical ) theory , we obtain ( by herbrand s theorem ) a similar result but without uniformity , i.e. , there are several constructions ( not necessarily just one ) , such that for every choice of the `` given points '' , one of the constructions will work .",
    "( the classical result ( unlike the constructive one ) holds only for formulas @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is quantifier - free . )    these points - only axiom system have conservative extensions with variables for lines and circles , and further conservative extensions with variables for angles , segments , and arcs , which can serve for the direct constructive formalization of euclidean geometry using hilbert s primitives ( as in @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , this points - only theory , with its short list of axioms , can be said to provide the logical foundations of constructive euclidean geometry . in particular , it supplies one detailed example of a formalization of constructive geometry , to which the independence results about the parallel postulate of @xcite apply ."
