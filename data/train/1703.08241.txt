    "numerous applications motivate the study of families of homomorphisms from a discrete group to a lie group .",
    "perhaps the most impactful ( and so compelling ) is the relationship in differential geometry to flat bundles and geometric structures ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* page 163 ) ) . given a manifold @xmath4 with a base point @xmath5 and a lie group @xmath1",
    ", one can construct a pointed principal @xmath1-bundle over @xmath4 as follows .",
    "let @xmath6 be the universal cover of @xmath4 and take a homomorphism @xmath7 .",
    "the group @xmath8 acts on @xmath9 by deck transformations in the first factor and by @xmath10 in the second .",
    "precisely , given @xmath11 and @xmath12 the action is @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the corresponding deck transformation in the deck group @xmath15 .",
    "this action is free since it is free on the first factor and so we obtain a principal @xmath1-bundle @xmath16 by considering the quotient by @xmath2 of the projection @xmath17 since @xmath18 .",
    "the transition maps are locally constant and hence the bundle is flat .",
    "conversely , any flat principal @xmath1-bundle @xmath19 has a holonomy homomorphism @xmath20 , once a base point is stipulated , so that @xmath21 .",
    "we see that the collection of flat principal @xmath1-bundles over @xmath22 is in bijective correspondence with the set @xmath23 .",
    "changing base points corresponds exactly to conjugating homomorphisms by @xmath1 .",
    "hence the conjugation quotient @xmath24 is bijectively equivalent to the collection of flat principal @xmath1-bundles over @xmath4 ( without dependence on the base point ) .    using homomorphisms to tie the geometry of a lie group @xmath1 to the topology of a manifold @xmath4 via its fundamental group accounts for many , if not all , of the ways that spaces of homomorphisms appear in geometry , topology , and mathematical physics .",
    "examples occur in the study of knot invariants @xcite , hyperbolic geometry @xcite , holomorphic vector bundles @xcite , yang - mills connections @xcite , higgs bundles @xcite , flat principal bundles @xcite , the geometric langlands program @xcite , and supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "another important example where spaces of homomorphisms are prominent is the study of locally homogeneous structures on manifolds @xcite . here",
    "the problem is , for a given topology on a compact manifold @xmath4 and a model geometry @xmath25 where @xmath1 is a lie group , to classify all the possible ways of introducing the local geometry of @xmath26 onto the topology of @xmath4 .",
    "the ehresmann - thurston theorem shows that the moduli space of such marked @xmath27-structures is locally homeomorphic to the space of conjugacy classes of @xmath23 with the quotient topology .",
    "here is a simple but illustrative example . if @xmath4 is an annulus then @xmath28 and @xmath29 by the evaluation mapping sending @xmath30 for any @xmath31 .",
    "say @xmath32 .",
    "then each conjugacy class of a diagonalizable @xmath31 is determined by its characteristic polynomial @xmath33 where @xmath34 .",
    "there are only two classes of non - diagonalizable matrices : one with trace @xmath35 and the other with trace @xmath36 .",
    "so the space of flat @xmath37-bundles over an annulus , with its closed points parametrized by @xmath38 , is @xmath39 where @xmath40 are  double - points \" corresponding to the orbits of non - diagonalizable matrices with trace @xmath41 . in particular , the space is not @xmath42 since the closure of @xmath40 is @xmath43 .",
    "one way to deal with the topological complications illustrated above is to consider an approximation of the quotient space @xmath44 .",
    "concretely , when @xmath2 is finitely presentable ( which means there is a finite rank free group @xmath45 and an epimorphism @xmath46 with finitely generated kernel ) , we can consider : @xmath47 there is a map , depending on @xmath48 , @xmath49 given by @xmath50 .",
    "this map , called an _ evaluation map _ ,",
    "is clearly injective and has as its image the set @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the identity . as @xmath1 is a lie group the image inherits the subspace topology from @xmath53 , and is consequently an analytic subvariety ( algebraic if @xmath1 is algebraic ) .",
    "one can show that @xmath54 is an embedding when @xmath55 is given the more intrinsic compact - open topology with respect to the discrete topology on @xmath2 .",
    "this observation shows that any two presentations for @xmath2 result in homeomorphic topologies on @xmath55 as analytic varieties .    now consider the subspace of _ polystable _ points :",
    "@xmath56 , where @xmath57 denotes the conjugation orbit of @xmath10 and @xmath58 is the closure of the orbit in the aforementioned topology on @xmath55 .",
    "then the orbit space @xmath59 is @xmath42 , and called the _ moduli space of @xmath1-representations of @xmath2_.    in the above example , @xmath60 since @xmath40 correspond to non - closed orbits .    here",
    "are some facts about @xmath0 .",
    "when @xmath1 is real reductive then @xmath0 is hausdorff and when @xmath1 is real algebraic @xmath0 is moreover semi - algebraic ( see the discussion in @xcite ) . in the special case when @xmath1 is compact , then @xmath61",
    "in the special case when @xmath1 is complex affine algebraic , then @xmath0 is homeomorphic to the geometric invariant theory ( git ) quotient @xmath62 with the euclidean topology ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 2.3 ) ) and so is naturally identified with the @xmath63-points of an affine algebraic set .",
    "moreover , again when @xmath1 is complex affine algebraic @xmath0 is _ homotopic _ to the potentially non - hausdorff quotient @xmath64 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 3.4 ) ) . with these cases in mind , we consider @xmath0 a reasonable approximation to @xmath44 in general .",
    "we will focus our attention in this exposition on the case when @xmath32 , so we say a few more words about the case when @xmath1 is complex reductive . in this case , the git quotient is @xmath65^g)$ ] where @xmath66 $ ] is the coordinate ring of the affine algebraic set @xmath67 and @xmath66^g$ ] is the ring of invariant elements in the coordinate ring under the action of conjugation @xmath68 .",
    "it is interesting to note @xcite shows that given any affine variety @xmath69 that there is a character variety @xmath0 that is tale locally isomorphic to @xmath69 as schemes .",
    "more globally , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3 ) shows there is a character variety @xmath0 that agrees biregularly with @xmath69 , excepting at most one point in @xmath0 , as varieties . in particular ,",
    "since points also arise as character varieties , this shows that character varieties generate the grothendieck group of affine varieties defined over @xmath70 .",
    "in the case @xmath71 the coordinate ring of @xmath0 is generated by functions of the form @xmath72 where @xmath73 is a word in generic unimodular matrices ( we will say more about this in section [ gen ] ) .",
    "this explains why the moduli space of @xmath1-representations is called `` character variety , '' as it is a variety of characters .",
    "however , as discussed in @xcite , for some @xmath1 this later fact remains true and for others it does not . on the other hand ,",
    "the main theorem in @xcite says that a finite quotient of the stable locus of @xmath0 is always in birationally bijective correspondence to a variety of characters , in particular , they have the same grothendieck class .",
    "so although the term `` character variety '' is not always completely accurate , it is accurate enough to not abandon .",
    "executive summary : the study of these moduli spaces is a mathematical playground where topology , geometry ( algebraic and differential ) , dynamics , ring theory , geometric analysis , and number theory all come together in non - trivial yet tractable ways . the group @xmath2 encodes topology and the lie group @xmath1 encodes geometry making @xmath0 the space of ways in which the geometry of @xmath1 can be imposed on the topology governed by @xmath2 .",
    "perhaps an apt slogan for the study of @xmath0 is the `` geometry of geometries . ''    in this paper",

    "we put them together to provide a new proof of the structure theorem for these character varieties , and provide an effective algorithm that does not rely on elimination ideal algorithms .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section 2",

    "we start with the infinite generating set of trace coordinates for @xmath139 $ ] and reduce it to a finite set .",
    "we then show it is _ unshortenable _ , that is , the finite subset of generators is a minimal generating set of trace coordinates .",
    "lastly we note that this unshortenable generating set is in fact minimal among all generating sets for the ring @xmath139 $ ] .",
    "thereafter , we pick out a maximal algebraically independent subset of these generators which give local parameters .    indeed , working in @xmath96 ,",
    "the cayley - hamilton ( characteristic ) equation gives @xmath140 and if we assume @xmath141 , as is the case in @xmath139 $ ] , we easily derive @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "hence the generators @xmath144 in @xmath145 $ ] project to @xmath146 in @xmath139 $ ] and so are not needed to generate the ring .",
    "we will see that this is essentially the only difference between @xmath145 $ ] and @xmath139 $ ] .",
    "minimal generators for @xmath145 $ ] were first worked out by sibirskii in @xmath147 @xcite ; see also @xcite .",
    "those generators project to an unshortenable generating set for @xmath139 $ ] ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 21 ) ) , and are in fact minimal among all generating sets by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 3.3 ) .",
    "we now derive these facts for the reader , as the `` word play '' used in their derivation is a useful technique to demonstrate .",
    "assuming @xmath148 , by multiplying the characteristic equation by @xmath149 , we have @xmath150 which in turn gives @xmath151 by taking the trace of each side .",
    "consequently , there are exactly @xmath81 generators of type @xmath152 in @xmath139 $ ] and none of type @xmath153 , @xmath154 ; which is minimal among these generators .",
    "precisely , the words are @xmath155 . hence @xmath156\\cong { \\mathbb{c}}[t]$ ] where @xmath38 corresponds to the invariant function @xmath152",
    "since the dimension of @xmath157 is 1 and as an irreducible affine variety , if there were a relation in the variable @xmath38 , the dimension would drop to 0 .",
    "more generally , the dimension of @xmath115 is equal to @xmath158 for @xmath159 , and 1 for @xmath160 .",
    "this follows since there exist irreducible representations for @xmath159 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 29 ) ) and so the generic stabilizer has dimension 0 if @xmath159 . in the case",
    "@xmath160 the generic stabilizer has dimension 1 , which accounts for the dimension of @xmath157 being 1 .",
    "now , multiplying equation on the left by a word @xmath161 and on the right by a word @xmath162 , and taking the trace of the resulting equation allows us to freely eliminate the generators of type @xmath163 as long as @xmath164 and at least one of @xmath161 or @xmath162 is not the identity .",
    "therefore , for the case @xmath165 $ ] , we are left with the generators @xmath166 @xmath167 @xmath168 since any other expression in two letters would result in a sub - expression with an exponent greater than one , which we just showed was not necessary to generate the ring .    since in this case",
    "the dimension of the variety is @xmath169 , there can be no further relations ( for the same reason as in the @xmath160 case ) and thus these generators are minimal .",
    "consequently , there are exactly @xmath170 generators of type @xmath171 in @xmath139 $ ] .",
    "this also gives a direct ( and short ) proof of the fricke - vogt theorem : @xmath172 ( equivalently @xmath165\\cong { \\mathbb{c}}[x , y , z]$ ] ) ; see @xcite and @xcite for the namesake , or @xcite for a modern treatment .",
    "next , replacing @xmath173 with @xmath174 in the cayley - hamilton equation gives @xmath175    simplifying this expression yields @xmath176    multiplying on the right by @xmath177 and taking the trace we get the expression @xmath178    at this point , we see that we only need @xmath179 generators of the form @xmath180 , and no others of length 3 or more in three letters .",
    "remember we already have shown we never need exponents larger than 1 in any letter .",
    "now taking this relation and substituting @xmath181 gives a relation for @xmath182 .    and",
    "substituting @xmath183 gives a relation for @xmath184 .",
    "sending @xmath185 gives one for @xmath186 ; and @xmath187 gives a relation for @xmath188 .",
    "subtracting , adding , and subtracting these four relations gives an expression for @xmath189 .",
    "however , sending @xmath190 in the first expression gives a relation for @xmath191 .",
    "this adds to our sum to give the following formula in @xcite : @xmath192    therefore , words of length 4 are not needed to generate the ring @xmath139 $ ] .",
    "we note that up until this point our calculations are valid over @xmath74 , but with equation we need coefficients in @xmath86 $ ] .",
    "we will see that the structure in theorem [ thm - scheme ] is likewise defined over @xmath86 $ ] .    continuing , since @xmath193 in equation can be any word in the generic matrices , we have proved that @xmath139 $ ] is generated by at most @xmath194 generators ( directly proving the ring is finitely generated ) .    in particular",
    ", here are the generators : @xmath195 of cardinality @xmath81 , @xmath196 of cardinality @xmath197 , and @xmath198 of cardinality @xmath199 .",
    "it is clear that these functions are contained in the ring of invariants , but it is not obvious that these are all of them @xmath128this is what procesi proved@xmath200 even more surprising is that the maximum word length is independent of the rank @xmath81 .",
    "this is related to the kuzmin conjecture @xmath128see @xcite@xmath200    now consider the @xmath201 case . the variety @xmath202 has dimension 6 .",
    "from the @xmath160 and @xmath203 cases and our previous calculations , we know there are only two generators not accounted for : @xmath180 and @xmath204 .",
    "however , we just saw that only one of these two generators is necessary .",
    "there are then only 7 generators left .",
    "if @xmath180 was allowed to be eliminated , we would conclude that @xmath202 was affine @xmath205 .    however , it is not hard to show there exists two representations which agree on the six generators of word length two or less but differ at @xmath180 .",
    "for instance , letting @xmath206,@xmath207 and @xmath208 or @xmath209 gives two such representations .",
    "one can further show there exists a relation for @xmath210 .",
    "together with the relation for @xmath211 , we conclude that @xmath202 is a hypersurface and the generator of the ideal is an irreducible quadratic polynomial in @xmath180 over the other 6 generators .",
    "geometrically , it is therefore a branched double cover of @xmath205 .",
    "precisely , @xmath202 is the spectrum of the following ring : @xmath212/\\langle t_{123}^2-pt_{123}+q\\rangle\\ ] ] where @xmath213 and @xmath214    the isomorphism is determined by the surjection @xmath212\\to { \\mathbb{c}}[{\\mathfrak{x}}_3]\\ ] ] given by @xmath215 , @xmath216 , @xmath217 , @xmath218 , @xmath219 , @xmath220 , and @xmath221 .",
    "since @xmath202 is irreducible of dimension 7 and not affine space the ideal is principal .",
    "this implies the kernel is exactly @xmath222 .    here",
    "is how we derive the product relation    @xmath223    using the characteristic equation , we derive @xmath224 from this we deduce @xmath225[{\\mathbf{b}}{\\mathbf{a}}{\\mathbf{c}}])\\ ] ] and @xmath226[{\\mathbf{a}}{\\mathbf{b}}{\\mathbf{a}}{\\mathbf{c}}]).\\ ] ] again using @xmath227 , we can simplify @xmath228 , @xmath229 , and @xmath230 . together , these formulae give the product relation .",
    "the upshot of this is that we can not eliminate @xmath180 and therefore the collection of @xmath231 is unshortenable .",
    "geometrically , this says that the minimal ( trace ) embedding of @xmath115 into @xmath232 is when @xmath233 , the embedding can be taken to be @xmath234\\mapsto\\bigg({\\mathrm{tr}}(\\rho(\\gamma_1)), ...",

    "the zariski tangent space may be understood as a subset of this ambient @xmath232 , and so @xmath242 . so it suffices to show that there exists a point @xmath243 so the zariski tangent space at this point has dimension @xmath238 .",
    "the tangent space at the identity representation ( denoted @xmath244 ) is the tangent at 0 in @xmath245 ( see ( * ? ? ? * lemma 3.16 ) ) .",
    "this latter tangent space is the tangent space for @xmath246 ( generated by an unshortenable set of @xmath247 trace generators ) with the @xmath81 algebraically independent traces @xmath248 specialized to @xmath249 .",
    "since the coordinate ring of @xmath245 is graded and generated by homogeneous trace generators , the point 0 is a cone point .",
    "therefore each generator of the unshortenable set of trace generators ( numbering exactly @xmath238 ) gives a distinct tangent vector ( they are an unshortenable generating set for the irrelevant ideal ) .",
    "thus , @xmath250 as required",

    ". intuitively the smallest the dimension of @xmath115 could get is @xmath158 and the biggest is @xmath255 .",
    "however , most matrices can be diagonalized ( eliminating two anti - diagonal coordinates of one generic matrix variable ) , leaving a diagonal action to fix an anti - diagonal coordinate of another matrix variable ( if @xmath159 ) .",
    "so generically @xmath115 is locally parameterized by @xmath158 coordinates if @xmath159 ( and exactly 1 coordinate if @xmath160 ) .",
