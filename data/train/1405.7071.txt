    "recent years have seen a dramatic increase in research on broadband optical waveguide systems @xcite . this increase in research efforts",
    "is driven by a wide range of applications , which include increasing transmission rates in fiber optics communication systems @xcite , enhancing data processing and transfer on computer chips @xcite , and enabling multiwavelength optical waveguide lasers @xcite .",
    "transmission in broadband systems is often based on wavelength - division - multiplexing ( wdm ) , where many pulse sequences propagate through the same waveguide .",
    "the pulses in each sequence ( each `` frequency channel '' ) propagate with the same group velocity , but the group velocity differs for pulses from different sequences . as a result , intersequence pulse collisions are very frequent , and can lead to severe transmission degradation @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the significant collision - induced effects can be used for controlling the propagation , for tuning of optical pulse parameters , such as energy , frequency , and phase , and for transmission switching , i.e. , the turning on or off of transmission of one or more of the pulse sequences @xcite .",
    "one of the most important processes affecting pulse propagation in nonlinear waveguide systems is due to nonlinear loss or gain .",
    "nonlinear loss ( gain ) can arise in optical waveguides due to multiphoton absorption ( emission ) or due to gain ( loss ) saturation @xcite .",
    "for example , cubic loss due to two - photon absorption ( tpa ) plays a key role in pulse dynamics in a variety of waveguides , including silicon waveguides @xcite .",
    "furthermore , cubic gain and quintic loss are essential parts of the widely used ginzburg - landau ( gl ) model for pulse dynamics in mode - locked lasers @xcite .",
    "the main effect of nonlinear loss ( gain ) on single pulse propagation is a continuous decrease ( increase ) of the pulse amplitude , which is qualitatively similar to the one due to linear loss ( gain ) @xcite .",
    "nonlinear loss ( gain ) also strongly affects optical pulse collisions , by causing an additional decrease ( increase ) of pulse amplitudes @xcite .",
    "this collision - induced amplitude shift , which is commonly known as interchannel crosstalk , can be a major impairment in broadband nonlinear waveguide systems .",
    "for example , recent experiments have shown that crosstalk induced by cubic loss ( due to tpa ) plays a key role in silicon nanowaveguide wdm systems @xcite .",
    "more specifically , the experiments demonstrated that tpa - induced crosstalk can lead to relatively high values of the bit - error - rate even in a wdm system with two channels @xcite .",
    "thus , it is important to find ways to suppress the detrimental effects of nonlinear gain - loss crosstalk .",
    "in several recent studies @xcite we provided a partial solution to this key problem and to an equally important challenge concerning the possibility to use the nonlinear crosstalk for broadband transmission switching .",
    "our approach was based on showing that amplitude dynamics of n sequences of colliding optical solitons can be described by lotka - volterra ( lv ) models for n species , where the exact form of the lv model depends on the nature of the waveguide s gain - loss profile @xcite .",
    "stability analysis of the steady states of the lv models was used to guide a clever choice of linear amplifier gain , which in turn leads to transmission stabilization , i.e. , the amplitudes of the propagating pulses approach desired predetermined values @xcite . furthermore , in ref .",
    "@xcite , we showed that static on - off and off - on transmission switching can be realized by an abrupt change in the waveguide s nonlinear gain or loss coefficients .",
    "the design of the switching setups reported in ref .",
    "@xcite was also guided by linear stability analysis of the steady states of the lv model .",
    "the results of refs .",
    "@xcite demonstrate the potential of employing crosstalk induced by nonlinear loss or gain for transmission control , stabilization , and switching .",
    "however , these results are still quite limited due to the following reasons .",
    "first , despite the progress made in refs .",
    "@xcite , the problem of robust transmission stabilization is still unresolved . in particular , for uniform waveguides with linear gain and cubic loss , such as silicon waveguides , radiative instability due to the growth of small amplitude waves is observed already at a distance @xmath0 even for cubic loss coefficient values as small as @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the radiative instability can be partially mitigated by employing uniform waveguides with linear loss , cubic gain , and quintic loss , i.e. , waveguides with a gl gain - loss profile @xcite .",
    "however , this uniform gl gain - loss setup is also limited , since the initial soliton amplitudes need to be close to the steady state values for transmission stabilization to be achieved .",
    "second , the switching setup studied in ref .",
    "@xcite is also quite limited , since it is based on a _",
    "static _ change in the waveguide s nonlinear gain - loss coefficients .",
    "moreover , only one switching event was demonstrated in this study , and off - on transmission was restricted to amplitude values larger than 0.65 . in view of the limitations of these uniform waveguide setups ,",
    "it is important to look for more robust ways for realizing stable long - distance propagation and broadband transmission switching .    in the current paper",
    "we take this important task , by developing a method for transmission stabilization and switching in broadband waveguide systems , which is based on employing hybrid waveguides with a clever choice of the physical parameters .",
    "the hybrid waveguides consist of odd - numbered spans with linear gain and cubic loss , and even - numbered spans with a gl gain - loss profile .",
    "transmission switching is _ dynamically _ realized by fast changes in linear amplifier gain .",
    "the robustness of the approach is demonstrated for two sequences of colliding optical solitons .",
    "we show that the dynamics of soliton amplitudes is described by a hybrid lv model .",
    "we then use stability analysis for the steady states of the lv model to determine the physical parameters that lead to suppression of radiative instability and as a result , to a drastic enhancement in transmission stability and switching robustness .",
    "the hybrid nature of the waveguides and the corresponding lv model plays a key role in the improvement .",
    "the predictions of the hybrid lv model are confirmed by numerical simulations with the full system of coupled nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equations .",
    "the results of the latter simulations show complete suppression of radiative instability , which enables stable propagation over distances larger by an order of magnitude compared with the results reported in ref .",
    "@xcite for uniform waveguides with linear gain and cubic loss .",
    "moreover , multiple dynamic on - off and off - on switching events are demonstrated over a significantly wider range of soliton amplitudes compared with that reported in ref .",
    "@xcite for a single static switching event in uniform waveguides with a gl gain - loss profile",
    ". the increased robustness of off - on switching in hybrid waveguides can be used for transmission recovery , that is , for the stable amplification of optical pulse sequences that experienced significant energy decay .",
    "we choose optical solitons as an example for the propagating pulses for the following reasons .",
    "first , in many broadband optical systems the waveguides are nonlinear and pulse propagation is accurately described by a perturbed nls equation @xcite .",
    "furthermore , optical soliton generation and propagation in the presence of two - photon and three - photon absorption was experimentally demonstrated in a variety of waveguide setups @xcite .",
    "second , since the unperturbed nls equation is an integrable model @xcite , derivation of analytic results for the effects of nonlinear gain or loss on interpulse collisions can be done in a rigorous manner .",
    "third , due to the soliton properties , soliton - based information transmission and processing in nonlinear broadband waveguide links is considered to be highly advantageous compared with other transmission methods @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ model ] , we present the coupled - nls model for pulse propagation in hybrid waveguides , along with the corresponding hybrid lv model for amplitude dynamics . we then use stability analysis of the equilibrium states of the hybrid lv model to obtain the physical parameter values required for robust transmission stabilization and broadband switching . in sec . [ simulations ] , we present the results of numerical simulations with the coupled - nls model for stable long - distance propagation and multiple transmission switching events .",
    "we also analyze these results in comparison with the predictions of the lv model .",
    "section [ conclusions ] is reserved for conclusions .",
    "we consider two sequences of optical solitons propagating with different group velocities in a hybrid waveguide system , in which the gain - loss profile is different for different waveguide spans .",
    "we take into account second - order dispersion , kerr nonlinearity , as well as linear and nonlinear gain and loss .",
    "we denote by @xmath2 distance along the waveguide , and assume that the gain - loss profile consists of linear gain and cubic loss in odd - numbered spans @xmath3 , and of linear loss , cubic gain , and quintic loss in even - numbered spans @xmath4 , where @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 .",
    "thus , the propagation is described by the following system of coupled - nls equations : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is time , @xmath10 is the electric field s envelope for the @xmath11th sequence , @xmath12 is the linear gain - loss coefficient , and @xmath13 describes nonlinear gain - loss effects . the indexes @xmath11 and @xmath14 run over pulse sequences , i.e. , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , while @xmath17 runs over the two gain - loss profiles . the second term on the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ hybrid1 ] ) corresponds to second - order dispersion , while the third and fourth terms describe the effects of intrasequence and intersequence interaction due to kerr nonlinearity .",
    "the optical pulses in the @xmath11th sequence are fundamental solitons of the unperturbed nls equation @xmath18 .",
    "the envelopes of these solitons are given by @xmath19 , where @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 are related to the soliton amplitude , group velocity ( and frequency ) , position , and phase , respectively .",
    "we assume a large group velocity difference @xmath26 , so that the solitons undergo a large number of fast intersequence collisions . due to the presence of nonlinear gain or loss the solitons experience additional changes in their amplitudes during the collisions , and",
    "this can be used for achieving robust transmission stabilization and switching .",
    "the nonlinear gain - loss term @xmath27 in odd - numbered spans is @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the cubic loss coefficient .",
    "the first and second terms on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ hybrid1_a ] ) describe intrasequence and intersequence interaction due to cubic loss .",

    "the first and second terms on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ hybrid1_b ] ) describe intrasequence and intersequence interaction due to cubic gain , while the the third , fourth , and fifth terms are due to quintic loss effects .    in several earlier works , we showed that amplitude dynamics of @xmath34 colliding sequences of optical solitons in the presence of linear and nonlinear gain or loss can be described by lv models for @xmath34 species , where the exact form of the model depends on the nature of the waveguide s gain - loss profile @xcite .",
    "the derivation of the lv models was based on the following assumptions .",
    "( 1 ) the temporal separation @xmath35 between adjacent solitons in each sequence is a constant satisfying : @xmath36 .",
    "in addition , the amplitudes are equal for all solitons from the same sequence , but are not necessarily equal for solitons from different sequences",
    ". this setup corresponds , for example , to return - to - zero phase - shift - keyed soliton transmission .",
    "( 2 ) the pulses circulate in a closed optical waveguide loop . ( 3 ) as @xmath37 , the pulses in each sequence are temporally well - separated . as a result ,",
    "intrasequence interaction is exponentially small and is neglected .    under the above assumptions , the soliton sequences are periodic , and as a result",
    ", the amplitudes of all pulses in a given sequence undergo the same dynamics .",
    "consider first odd - numbered waveguide spans , where the gain - loss profile consists of linear gain and cubic loss . taking into account collision - induced amplitude shifts due to cubic loss and single - pulse amplitude changes due to linear gain and cubic loss , we obtain the following equation for amplitude dynamics of @xmath11th sequence solitons @xcite : @xmath38 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 . in wdm transmission systems , it is often required to achieve a transmission steady state , in which pulse amplitudes in all sequences are nonzero constants .",
    "we therefore look for a steady state of eq .",
    "( [ hybrid3 ] ) in the form @xmath39 , @xmath40 , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the desired equilibrium amplitude values .",
    "this requirement yields : @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "note that in transmission stabilization and off - on switching we use @xmath45 , corresponding to the desired situation of equal amplitudes in both sequences .",
    "in contrast , in on - off switching , we use @xmath46 , since turning off of transmission of only one sequence is difficult to realize with @xmath47 .",
    "also note that switching is obtained by fast changes in the values of the @xmath48 coefficients , such that @xmath49 becomes asymptotically stable in off - on switching and unstable in on - off switching .",
    "the switching is realized _ dynamically _ , via appropriate fast changes in amplifier gain , and is thus very different from the _ static _ switching that was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the lv model for amplitude dynamics in even - numbered spans is obtained by taking into account collision - induced amplitude shifts due to cubic gain and quintic loss , as well as single - pulse amplitude changes due to linear loss , cubic gain , and quintic loss .",
    "the derivation yields the following equation for amplitude dynamics of the @xmath11th sequence solitons @xcite : @xmath50 .",

    "( [ hybrid4 ] ) , we obtain @xmath52 , where @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "note that in even - numbered spans , the value of @xmath55 is used for further stabilization of transmission and switching .",
    "transmission stabilization and switching are guided by stability analysis of the steady states of eqs .",
    "( [ hybrid3 ] ) and ( [ hybrid4 ] ) .",
    "we therefore turn to describe the results of this analysis , starting with the lv model ( [ hybrid3 ] ) .",
    "we consider the equilibrium amplitude values @xmath56 and @xmath57 , for which the linear gain coefficients are @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "we first note that @xmath60 is asymptotically stable , if @xmath61 , and is unstable otherwise .",
    "that is , @xmath60 undergoes a bifurcation at @xmath62 . the off - on and on - off switching",
    "are based on this bifurcation , and are realized dynamically by appropriate changes in linear amplifier gain . to explain this , we denote by @xmath63 the value of the decision level , distinguishing between on and off transmission states .",
    "the off - on switching is achieved by a fast increase in @xmath64 from @xmath65 to @xmath66 , such that the steady state @xmath60 turns from unstable to asymptotically stable .",
    "consequently , before switching , @xmath67 and @xmath68 tend to @xmath69 and @xmath70 , while after switching , @xmath67 and @xmath68 tend to @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "thus , transmission of sequence 2 is turned on in this case . on - off switching",
    "is realized in a similar manner by a fast decrease in @xmath64 from @xmath73 to @xmath74 . in this case @xmath67 and @xmath68 tend to @xmath71 and @xmath72 before the switching , and to @xmath69 and @xmath70 after switching . as a result ,",
    "transmission of sequence 2 is turned off by the change in @xmath64 .",
    "our coupled - nls simulations show that stable ultra - long - distance transmission requires @xmath35 values larger than 15 . indeed , for smaller @xmath35 values , high - order effects that are neglected by eqs .",
    "( [ hybrid3 ] ) and ( [ hybrid4 ] ) , such as intrasequence interaction and radiation emission , lead to pulse pattern degradation and to breakdown of the lv model description at large distances . to enable comparison with results of ref .",

    "moreover , multiple on - off and off - on dynamic switching events , which are realized by fast changes in linear amplifier gain , were demonstrated over a wide range of soliton amplitudes , including amplitude values smaller than 0.35 . as a result",
    ", the value of the decision level for distinguishing between on and off transmission states can be set as low as @xmath171 , compared with @xmath172 for the single static switching event that was demonstrated in ref .",

    "based on these results , we conclude that the hybrid waveguide setups studied in the current paper lead to significant enhancement of transmission stability and switching robustness compared with the uniform nonlinear waveguides considered earlier .",
    "finally , it is worth making some remarks about potential applications of hybrid waveguides with different crosstalk mechanisms than the ones considered in the current paper .",
    "of particular interest are waveguide setups , where the main crosstalk mechanism in odd - numbered and even - numbered spans are due to delayed raman response and a gl gain - loss profile , respectively .",
    "one can envision employing these hybrid waveguides for enhancement of supercontinuum generation .",
    "indeed , the interplay between raman - induced energy exchange in soliton collisions and the raman self - frequency shift is known to play a key role in widening the bandwidth of the radiation @xcite .",
    "however , the process is somewhat limited due to the fact that energy is always transferred from high - frequency components to low - frequency ones @xcite . this limitation can be overcome by employing waveguide spans with a gl gain - loss profile subsequent to spans with delayed raman response .",
    "indeed , the main effect of cubic gain on soliton collisions is an energy increase for both high- and low - frequency solitons . as a result",
    ", the energies of the high frequency components of the radiation will be replenished in even - numbered spans .",
    "this will in turn sustain the supercontinuum generation along longer propagation distances and might enable a wider radiation bandwidth compared with the one in uniform waveguides , where delayed raman response is the main crosstalk - inducing mechanism .",
