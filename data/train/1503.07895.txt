    "a rotation is an example of an isometry , a map that moves points without changing the distances between them .",
    "a rotation is a linear transformation that describes the motion of a rigid body around a fixed point or an axis and can be expressed with an orthonormal matrix which is called a rotation matrix .",
    "@xmath0 rotation matrices form a special orthogonal group , denoted by @xmath1 , which , for @xmath2 is non - abelian .",
    "the group of @xmath0 rotation matrices is isomorphic to the group of rotations in an @xmath3 dimensional space .",
    "this means that multiplication of rotation matrices corresponds to composition of rotations .",
    "rotation matrices are used extensively for computations in geometry , kinematics , physics , computer graphics , animations , and optimization problems involving the estimation of rigid body transformations . for this reason ,",
    "the generation of a rotation matrix is considered to be an important problem in mathematics .    in the two dimensional euclidean space , a rotation matrix",
    "can easily be generated using basic linear algebra or complex numbers .",
    "similarly , in the lorentzian plane , a rotation matrix can be generated by double ( hyperbolic ) numbers . in higher dimensional spaces ,",
    "obtaining a rotation matrix using the inner product is impractical since each column and row of a rotation matrix must be a unit vector perpendicular to all other columns and rows , respectively .",
    "these constraints make it difficult to construct a rotation matrix using the inner product . instead , in higher dimensional spaces",
    ", rotation matrices can be generated using various other methods such as unit quaternions , the rodrigues formula , the cayley formula , and the householder transformation .",
    "we will give a brief review of these methods and use elliptical versions of these methods later in the paper .",
    "* 1 . a unit quaternion :* each unit quaternion represents a rotation in the euclidean 3-space .",
    "that is , only four numbers are enough to construct a rotation matrix , the only constraint being that the norm of the quaternion is equal to 1 . also , in this method",
    ", the rotation angle and the rotation axis can be determined easily . however , this method is only valid in the three dimensional spaces ( @xcite , @xcite ) . in the lorentzian space , timelike split quaternions",
    "are used instead of ordinary usual quaternions ( @xcite , @xcite ) .    *",
    "rodrigues formula :* an orthonormal matrix can be obtained using the matrix exponential @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a skew symmetric matrix and @xmath6 is the rotation angle . in this method , only three numbers are needed to construct a rotation matrix in the euclidean 3-space ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and , @xcite).the vector set up with these three numbers gives the rotation axis .",
    "this method can be extended to the @xmath3 dimensional euclidean and lorentzian spaces ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and , @xcite ) .    *",
    "cayley formula :* the formula @xmath7 gives a rotation matrix , where @xmath5 is a skew symmetric matrix .",
    "rotation matrices can be given by the cayley formula without using trigonometric functions .",
    "the cayley formula is an easy method but it does nt give the rotation angle directly ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and , @xcite ) .",
    "householder transformation :* the householder transformation gives us a reflection matrix .",
    "we can obtain a rotation matrix using two householder transformations .",
    "this method is an elegant method but it can be long and tedious . also , the rotation angle has to be calculated separately .",
    "this transformation can be used in several scalar product spaces ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and , @xcite ) .",
    "details about generating rotation matrices , particularly in the euclidean and lorentzian spaces , using these methods can be found in various papers , some of which are given in the reference section .",
    "those authors mostly studied the rotation matrices in the positive definite scalar product space whose associated matrices are diag@xmath8 and interpreted the results geometrically .",
    "for example , quaternions and timelike split quaternions were used to generate rotation matrices in the three dimensional euclidean and lorentzian spaces where the associated matrices were @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively . in these spaces ,",
    "rotations occur on the sphere @xmath11 or the hyperboloids @xmath12 .",
    "that is , euclidean and lorentzian rotation matrices help us to understand spherical and hyperbolic rotations . in the euclidean space ,",
    "a rotation matrix rotates a point or a rigid body through a circular angle about an axis .",
    "that is , the motion happens on a circle .",
    "similarly , in the lorentzian space , a rotation matrix rotates a point through an angle about an axis circularly or hyperbolically depending on whether the rotation axis is timelike or spacelike , respectively .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate elliptical rotation matrices , which are orthogonal matrices in the scalar product space , whose associated matrix is diag@xmath13 with @xmath14 .",
    "first , we choose a proper scalar product to the given ellipse ( or ellipsoid ) such that this ellipse ( or ellipsoid ) is equivalent to a circle ( or sphere ) for the scalar product space .",
    "that is , the scalar product does nt change the distance between any point on the ellipse ( or ellipsoid ) and origin . interpreting a motion on an ellipsoid",
    "is an important concept since planets usually have ellipsoidal shapes and elliptical orbits .",
    "the geometry of ellipsoid can be examined using affine transformations , because of an ellipsoid can be considered as an affine map of the unit sphere . for example , for the ellipsoid  @xmath15 and the unit sphere @xmath16 we can write @xmath17 using the affine transformation @xmath18 , @xmath19 then we have , @xmath20 where @xmath21    the aim of this study is to explain the motion on the ellipsoid @xmath22 as a rotation , using the proper inner product , vector product and elliptical orthogonal matrices . in this method , the elliptical inner product , the vector product and the angles are compatible with the parameters @xmath6 and @xmath23 of the parametrization @xmath24 .",
    "we use the classical methods to generate elliptical rotation matrices . in the preliminaries section , first we explain how to define a suitable scalar product and a vector product for a given ellipsoid .",
    "then we introduce the symmetric , skew symmetric and orthogonal matrices in this elliptical scalar product space .",
    "finally , we examine the motion on an ellipsoid using elliptical rotation matrices . in section 3",
    ", we generate the elliptical rotation matrices using various classical methods ( such as , cayley formula , rodrigues formula and householder transformation ) compatible with the defined scalar product .",
    "furthermore , we defined the elliptic quaternions and generate elliptical rotations using unit elliptic quaternions .",
