    "relic gravitational waves ( rgws ) are generated in the very early universe due to the superadiabatic amplification of zero point quantum fluctuations of the gravitational field @xcite , and freely evolve in the whole stage of the universe",
    "so rgws carry invaluable information about early history of our universe inaccessible to any other medium .",
    "detection of rgws is rightly considered a highest priority for the upcoming cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) experiments .",
    "the current cmb experiments are yet to detect a definite signature of rgws @xcite . in the near future , the successive generation of the experiments , including the space - based planck satellite @xcite and the various ground - based experiments @xcite together with a host of balloon - borne experiments",
    "@xcite will provide an increasing sensitive measurement of rgws .",
    "the space - based experiments , as cobe , wmap and planck satellites , can remove atmospheric noises and observe the fairly cleaned cmb temperature and polarization anisotropy fields .",
    "in addition , the space - based experiments provide the unique opportunity to detect the cmb power spectra in the largest scale ( @xmath6 ) by surveying the full sky .    at the same time , the cmb polarization field can also be observed by the ground - based experiments .",
    "since the atmospheric emission is not expected to be linearly polarized @xcite , by integrating deeply on the relatively small patches of sky , it is possible to make a measurement of the polarization anisotropies with a comparable signal - to - noise ratio to a satellite experiment on all but the largest angular scales .    in this letter , we shall investigate the detection abilities for the rgws , by the observations of the forthcoming generation of the ground - based and space - based experiments . by calculating the constraints on the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath8 and the tensor spectral index @xmath7",
    ", we shall compare the detection abilities of these two types of experiments .",
    "we also investigate the potential improvement of the detection ability by combining the observations of them .",
    "the main contribution to the temperature and polarization anisotropies of the cmb comes from two types of cosmological perturbations , density perturbations ( also known as the scalar perturbations ) and rgws ( also known as the tensor perturbations ) .",
    "the primordial power spectra of these perturbations are usually assumed to be power laws , which is a generic prediction of a wide range of scenarios of the early universe @xcite .",
    "if we ignore the running of the spectral indices , the primordial spectra can be written as the following simple forms @xmath9 @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the pivot wavenumber , which can be arbitrarily chosen . @xmath12 and @xmath7 are the scalar and tensor spectral indices .",
    "the tensor - to - scalar ratio is defined by @xmath13 for a fixed @xmath14 , the primordial power spectra of rgws are completely determined by two parameters @xmath8 and @xmath7 , if a power - law form in ( [ pt ] ) is assumed .",
    "the simplest single - field slow - roll inflationary models predict a consistency relation between @xmath8 and @xmath7 @xcite : @xmath15 . however , this consistency relation is incorrect for other inflationary models @xcite .",
    "so the determination the parameters @xmath8 and @xmath7 by the observations , provides an excellent opportunity to distinguish various inflationary - type models .    since in this letter",
    ", we are primarily interested in the parameters of the rgw field , in the analysis below we shall work with a fixed cosmological background model . more specifically",
    ", we shall work in the framework of @xmath16cdm model , and keep the background cosmological parameters fixed at the values determined by a typical model @xcite @xmath17 furthermore , in order to show the results in the figures , we adopt the following parameters of the density perturbations and tensor spectral index , @xmath18      let us turn our attention to the cmb field .",
    "density perturbations and gravitational waves produce temperature and polarization anisotropies in the cmb characterized by four angular power spectra @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 as functions of the multipole number @xmath23 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath19 is the power spectrum of the temperature anisotropies , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the power spectra of the so - called @xmath24-mode and @xmath25-mode polarizations and @xmath22 is the power spectrum of the temperature - polarization cross correlation .    in the linear theory , the various power spectra @xmath26 ( where @xmath27 or @xmath28 ) can be presented in the following form @xmath29 where @xmath30 are the power spectra due to the density perturbations , and @xmath31 are the power spectra due to rgws .",
    "the cmb power spectra @xmath26 are theoretical constructions determined by ensemble averages over all possible realizations of the underlying random process .",
    "however , in real cmb observations , we only have access to a single sky , and hence to a single realization . in order to obtain information on the power spectra from a single realization",
    ", it is required to construct estimators of power spectra @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "the probability distribution functions for the estimators are detailed described in @xcite , which predicts the expectation values of the estimators @xmath33 and the standard deviations @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the cut - sky factor , and @xmath36 are the noise power spectra , determined by the specific experiments .",
    "being uncorrelated @xcite .",
    "however , the bin does not affect our conclusion in this paper . ]      considering an experiment with multiple frequency channels , the total instrumental noise power spectra can be approximately presented as ( see for instance @xcite ) , @xmath37 here @xmath38 is the noise power spectrum for the individual frequency channel , which is given by @xmath39.\\ ] ] in this formula , @xmath40 is the full width half maximum ( fwhm ) beam size .",
    "the pixel noises @xmath41 depend on the survey design and the instrumental parameters .",
    "first , let us focus on the space - based planck satellite . in this paper , we consider four frequency channels for the planck satellite , which are listed in table [ table1 ] .",
    "after two full sky survey ( 14 months ) , the pix noises @xmath41 are expected to be the values listed in table [ table1 ] for different channels . in fig.[figure0 ] , we plot the instrumental noise power spectrum @xmath42 , as a comparison with the values of cmb power spectrum @xmath43 in the model with @xmath4 and @xmath44 .",
    "we find , in the model of @xmath4 , the value of @xmath43 is larger than that of @xmath45 only at the largest scale .",
    "so planck satellite can detect rgws mainly by the observation in this largest scale , which will be clearly shown in the following section .",
    "for a ground - based experiment with @xmath46 detectors , a solid angle per pixel @xmath47 and a sensitivity net , we assume it will survey an area @xmath48 in the integration time @xmath49 .",
    "the pixel polarization noises are @xmath50 in this paper , we shall discuss five kinds of ground - based experiments : bicep , polarbear ( i ) and ( ii ) , quiet ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "the instrumental parameters for these experiments are given in the appendix [ appendix ] .",
    "notice that , the ground - based experiments are only sensitive to the polarizations . since the ground - based experiments can only survey a small part of the full sky , it can not encode the information of cmb field in the very large scale . from fig.[figure0 ] , we find that ground - based experiments have much smaller noise power spectra than planck satellite .",
    "we should notice that , cosmic lensing can convert the @xmath24-mode polarization into @xmath25-mode ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "so the @xmath25-mode spectrum due to rgws will be contaminated by a cosmic lensing contribution .",
    "the lensed @xmath21 is also shown in fig.[figure0 ] , which can be treated as a part of the total noise power spectrum @xmath45 as well as instrumental noise power spectra in ( [ instrumental ] ) .",
    "in addition to the instrumental noises and lensing noise , various foregrounds , such as the synchrotron and dust , are also the important contaminations in the cmb observation .",
    "it is hoped that the multifrequency observations and the hard work by astronomical community might allow future experiments can reduce the foreground noises in a very accurate level ( see for instance @xcite ) . so in the following discussion , we shall not consider this kind of contamination .",
