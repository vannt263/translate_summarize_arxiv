    "to obtain superconductivity in a layered copper - oxide compound , it is necessary to introduce charge carriers into the antiferromagnetic cuo@xmath0 planes .",
    "recent neutron diffraction studies of the system la@xmath6nd@xmath7sr@xmath8cuo@xmath3 @xcite provide evidence that the dopant - induced holes choose to segregate into periodically - spaced stripes which separate antiferromagnetic domains , in a manner similar to that found in hole - doped la@xmath0nio@xmath3 @xcite . the charge and spin stripe modulations",
    "are identified by the appearance of scattering at incommensurate positions . in the nd - doped system , elastic scattering",
    "is observed , corresponding to static stripes . in pure la@xmath9sr@xmath8cuo@xmath3 ,",
    "the magnetic scattering that is observed is purely inelastic @xcite . where samples with and without nd , but with the same sr concentration , have been measured , the incommensurate ( ic ) splittings of the magnetic signal are found to be essentially identical @xcite .",
    "it has been proposed that the spin correlations in the two systems are fundamentally the same , thus implying similar charge correlations .",
    "the static nature of the stripes in the nd - doped system is attributed @xcite to pinning of the otherwise dynamic correlations by a special distortion of the lattice @xcite . that distortion is driven by purely ionic interactions and",
    "is stabilized by the smaller ionic radius of the substituted nd .    to strengthen the case for the charge - stripe interpretation , it is necessary go beyond a simple comparison of incommensurabilities . in this paper",
    "i will show that the neutron scattering measurements of spin fluctuations in superconducting la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 and yba@xmath0cu@xmath4o@xmath10 are quantitatively consistent with what one should expect based on the stripe picture .",
    "the general expectations are described in section 2 .",
    "specific analyses for the two different superconductors are given in sections 3 and 4 , respectively .",
    "section 5 contains some further discussion .",
    "first recall the situation for the 2d heisenberg model @xcite . at @xmath11 ,",
    "where long - range order exists , the spin - wave dispersion is linear at small @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) , and can be expressed as @xmath14 . at finite temperatures ,",
    "thermal fluctuations result in a finite spin - spin correlation length @xmath15 .",
    "spin waves are overdamped for @xmath16 , but spin - wave dispersion should still be detectable for @xmath17 ( as long as @xmath18 is less than the superexchange energy @xmath19 ) .",
    "the characteristic energy @xmath20 separating the over- and underdamped regimes is then given by @xmath21 as for the dynamical susceptibility , @xmath22 , @xmath20 acts somewhat like a gap energy @xcite .",
    "if @xmath23 is integrated over @xmath24 to give @xmath25 , then there is a peak at @xmath26 , with @xmath25 going to zero as @xmath27 goes to zero .",
    "next consider an ordered stripe phase .",
    "the charge stripes need not affect the superexchange energy within the antiferromagnetic domains , but they certainly will weaken the magnetic coupling between domains .",
    "castro neto and hone @xcite have considered the effect of the anisotropic coupling on the spin wave velocity . for a large anisotropy ,",
    "the velocity @xmath28 for propagation parallel to the stripes is equal to @xmath29 ; it is more difficult to estimate an effective velocity perpendicular to the stripes because the stripe modulation should result in several optical branches as well as the acoustic mode .",
    "an experimental test of this situation is given by recent measurements of spin waves in stripe - ordered la@xmath0nio@xmath30 @xcite .",
    "that study found @xmath31 for propagation parallel to the stripes .",
    "dispersion was less well defined but comparable in the perpendicular direction .",
    "( note that the spin waves disperse out of the ic points in reciprocal space that characterize the magnetic order . )",
    "thus , it seems reasonable to take @xmath32 as an estimate of the effective spin - wave velocity in an ordered stripe phase .    finally , consider a stripe phase with a finite spin - spin correlation length induced by fluctuations of the charge stripes .",
    "the characteristic energy separating over- and underdamped modes should now be @xmath33 excitations at @xmath34 should look spin - wave - like . on the other hand ,",
    "a scan at a fixed excitation energy smaller than @xmath35 through the ic points characterizing the stripe correlations should show a broad peak centered at each ic point , with the width varying inversely as @xmath15 . to obtain an analytic formula describing the @xmath36-dependence of the scattering , consider a model in which the spins have a uniform correlation within each domain , but where the correlations between domains fall off exponentially with distance .",
    "if the charge stripes are separated by @xmath37 lattice spacings , then the intensity along @xmath38 should be proportional to @xmath39 where @xmath40 , and @xmath41 is the structure factor for a single domain .",
    "( the factor of @xmath42 included in @xmath43 takes care of the antiphase relationship between neighboring domains . ) for the calculations below , it will be assumed that the spin correlations also fall off exponentially parallel to the stripes , with the same correlation length @xmath15 .",
    "recently , hayden _ et al . _",
    "@xcite reported inelastic neutron scattering measurements of @xmath22 in la@xmath44sr@xmath45cuo@xmath3 , covering a very large energy range .",
    "they found that @xmath23 at @xmath46  mev could be modelled reasonably well using spin wave formulas , with only a slight reduction in @xmath19 . at lower energies",
    ", they showed that @xmath25 has a peak at @xmath47  mev . if this latter result is combined with the value @xmath48  mev -   @xcite , then by inverting eq .",
    "( 2 ) one obtains the estimate @xmath49 .    figure  [ fg : lsco ] shows an inelastic scan , at a fixed energy transfer of 3  mev , through the ic peaks found in a single crystal of la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the peak positions are consistent with a charge stripe period of @xmath50 .",
    "the solid line through the data points is a calculation using eq .",
    "( 3 ) and the estimate @xmath51only the amplitude and the linear background have been adjusted to fit the data .",
    "( the calculated intensity , taking into account signal from all 4 ic peaks , was also convolved with the experimental resolution function . )",
    "the calculation clearly gives an excellent description of the data .",
    "in contrast to the 214 system , measurements of @xmath23 in yba@xmath0cu@xmath4o@xmath10 do not show well resolved ic peaks @xcite . as shown in fig .  2",
    ", the scattered intensity is peaked at @xmath52 , but with a peak shape that has a rather flat top and steep sides . despite the lack of clear evidence for incommensurability , it is possible nevertheless to describe the data with the same stripe model discussed above . to give the stripe picture an honest test , @xmath15",
    "will again be estimated using eq .",
    "the value of @xmath35 is approximately @xmath53  mev @xcite , and @xmath54  mev -   @xcite , which together yield @xmath55 . to estimate the stripe spacing , assuming that the hole density within the charge stripes is the same as in the 214 system @xcite , it is first necessary evaluate the hole concentration within a plane .",
    "inverting the formula @xcite @xmath56 yields @xmath57 for the @xmath58-k sample , which corresponds closely to @xmath59 . the solid line through the data in fig .",
    "2 represents a calculation using the same stripe model as above , with the parameter values @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the calculated function was convolved with the spectrometer resolution function , and only the amplitude and background were adjusted to fit the data .    for the calculated curve ,",
    "the filling in of weight between the ic peaks occurs because @xmath15 is less than the stripe spacing @xmath61 . in this case",
    "the weak correlation between neighboring antiphase domains results in little interference . at @xmath52 the scattering from an individual domain does not get cancelled by the weak contributions from neighboring domains .",
    "in contrast , the situation for la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 is @xmath62 .",
    "that is the necessary for condition for obtaining well resolved ic peaks .",
    "although the correlations between antiphase domains are perhaps less well defined in 123 , the smaller value of @xmath15 suggests greater stripe fluctuations , a condition that appears to correlate with an increased @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the @xmath24 dependence of scattered intensity from low - energy spin fluctuations in la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 and yba@xmath0cu@xmath4o@xmath10 can be consistently interpreted on the basis of dynamic antiphase antiferromagnetic domains .",
    "the correlation lengths @xmath15 used to model the scattering measurements were calculated from experimental values of @xmath35 and @xmath64 .",
    "it was pointed out that the ic peaks become unresolvable when @xmath65 , where @xmath61 is the charge - stripe spacing .",
    "there are , of course , other neutron scattering results that are consistent with the stripe picture .",
    "a comparison of @xmath25 in superconducting yba@xmath0cu@xmath4o@xmath10 and antiferromagnetic yba@xmath0cu@xmath4o@xmath66 shows that , despite a difference in @xmath27 dependence , the overall weight within the range 5 to 50  mev is comparable @xcite .",
    "similar results were found in a comparison of la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 and la@xmath0cuo@xmath3 @xcite , although the spectral weight for the superconductor is somewhat reduced when the comparison is extended up to 300  mev . with a strong segregation of holes of density @xmath67 ,",
    "the density of cu moments contributing to the low - energy ( @xmath68  mev ) spin fluctuations is roughly @xmath69 , so one may expect to see relatively little change in overall spectral weight compared to the undoped antiferromagnet .",
    "measurements on zn - doped la@xmath44sr@xmath45cuo@xmath3 have shown that the positions and @xmath70-widths of the ic peaks are essentially unaffected by the presence of the zn @xcite . similarly , doping zn into yba@xmath0cu@xmath4o@xmath10",
    "does not change the @xmath24 dependence of the scattering , but it does shift spectral weight down to low - energy , so that @xmath25 looks more like that of an antiferromagnet @xcite .",
    "this suggests that doping zn into the cuo@xmath0 planes destroys superconductivity by pinning the stripes .",
    "recently there has been considerable excitement over observations of resonant enhancements of the magnetic scattering below @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "if the enhanced scattering is assumed to come from intinerant electrons , then it is certainly quite remarkable . on the other hand ,",
    "if the magnetic scattering all comes from antiferromagnetic domains between charge stripes , the change in the scattering might in some way be associated with a reduction in damping of the spin fluctuations due to the onset of superconductivity . in any case , it will be interesting to see how models of these effects evolve ."
