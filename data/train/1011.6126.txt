    "a decade has passed since the discovery of the association between the long - duration gamma ray burst ( grb )  980425 and the broad - lined type  ic sn  1998bw @xcite .",
    "this realization led to a renewed interest in the study of stripped - envelope core - collapse supernovae ( sne ) . in the case of sn  1998bw , the high kinetic energy inferred from the expansion velocity coupled with an exceedingly high luminosity and strong radio emission set it apart from all other previously - observed core - collapse sne .",
    "since then these attributes have been shown also by other grb - related sne like sn  2003lw @xcite and sn  2003dh @xcite .",
    "the x - ray flash sn  2006aj @xcite , was not as extreme as the previous sne , nevertheless it shows expansion velocity much higher then normal type ic sne .",
    "in addition to these grb related , broad - lined sne  ic , there have also been a number of other discovered broad - lined events that are apparently not associated with a grb , e.g. sn  1997ef , @xcite , sn  2002ap @xcite , sn  2003jd @xcite and sn  2007ru @xcite .",
    "recently two other broad - lined events have been published that underscore the heterogeneous nature of this family of sne . in particular ,",
    "early phase spectra of the broad - lined type  ic sn  2007bg exhibit evidence of _ helium _",
    "@xcite , while @xcite have presented the first case of a _ hydrogen - rich _ broad - lined type  iib sn  2003bg .",
    "in this paper we present ultraviolet , optical and near - infrared photometry and optical spectroscopy of sn  2009bb .",
    "this object was discovered by the chilean automated supernova search chase @xcite on 2009 march 21.11 ut with the panchromatic robotic optical monitoring and polarimetry telescope ( prompt ) 3 at the cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) .",
    "the sn is located ( see figure  [ fig1.1 ] ) at @xmath10 @xmath8 @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xmath8 @xmath13 ( equinox j2000 ) @xcite , which is about 170 west and 135 south of the center of the host galaxy ngc 3278 .",
    "sn  2009bb was not visible in an unfiltered chase image ( mag @xmath14 19.2 ) obtained two days prior to the discovery image on 2009 march 19.20 ut . we were therefore able to use this image in combination with the first follow - up images to obtain a tight constraint on the explosion epoch ( see section 2.3 ) .",
    "as this was an extremely young sn , an intensive follow - up campaign was organized using the prompt telescopes @xcite and the facilities available to the carnagie supernova project ( csp ; hamuy et al .",
    "2006 ) at las campanas observatory ( lco ) .",
    "a week after discovery , @xcite classified sn  2009bb as a broad - lined sn  ic .",
    "radio and x - ray observations were obtained with the vla and chandra telescope .",
    "an analysis of these data indicates that sn  2009bb was associated with strong radio emission and mild x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "these findings are suggestive of the presence of a relativistic outflow typically associated with grb - related sne .",
    "the explosion site of sn  2009bb has been studied in detail by @xcite who showed that contrary to other jet - driven sn explosions , which to date have always been identified with metal poor environments [ see @xcite for a review ] , the explosion site of sn  2009bb exhibits a metallicity between 1.7 to 3.5 z@xmath4 .",
    "@xcite also found a super - solar metallicity for the environment of the long - duration grb  020819 .",
    "these findings present a challenge to the theoretical framework developed to explain grbs @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite have recently proposed a model in which the progenitor star does not need to be in a low metallicity environment . in this scenario",
    "sn  2009bb represents a peculiar object that could open new theoretical developments .",
    "the organization of this article is as follows .",
    "the photometric data are analyzed in section  2 , and in section  3 the pseudo - bolometric light curve is used to estimate some physical parameters of sn  2009bb .",
    "an analysis of the spectroscopic evolution of sn  2009bb is carried out in section  4 , and section 5 presents a discussion and summary of the major results .",
    "observation and data reduction techniques are described in appendix a.1 and a.2 .",
    "the @xmath15 photometry of sn  2009bb is reported in table  1 , while the light curves are shown in figure  [ fig2.1 ] .",
    "also plotted in the latter figure are photometry of the broad - lined type  ic sne  1998bw , 2002ap , 2003jd , 2006aj and sn  2007bg . from this comparison of light curves ,",
    "it is clear that in the @xmath16 bands during the pre - maximum phase , sn  2009bb , sn  2006aj and sn  2003jd show a similar evolution , while sn  1998bw and sn  2002ap have a slower and faster rise - time , respectively . in the @xmath2 band ,",
    "sn  2009bb shows , with the exception of sn  1998bw , a slower rise than all the other sne included in the plot . at post - maximum phases ( epoch @xmath17 @xmath120 days ) , the @xmath16 light curves of sn  2009bb decrease in magnitude",
    "faster than the other objects , except for sn  2006aj , which appears to be quite similar to sn  2009bb .",
    "this is not the case in the @xmath2 band where the sn  2006aj decline rate is clearly faster than that of sn  2009bb . in the latter band , the object that most resembles sn",
    "2009bb is sn  2003jd , while sn  2002ap and sn  1998bw display much slower decline rates .",
    "the @xmath18 photometry of sn  2009bb is reported in table  2 , while the light curves are shown in figure  [ fig2.2 ] .",
    "these are the first - ever observations of a broad - lined sn  ic in the sloan bands . for comparison in the plot",
    ", we also include @xmath19-band light curves of sn  1998bw , sn  2002ap and sn  2006aj .",
    "the @xmath20 light curve of sn  2009bb most resembles the @xmath19-band observations of sn  2002ap , but again declines more rapidly than sn  1998bw .",
    "it should be stressed that figure  [ fig2.2 ] compares light curves on different photometric systems , and therefore the comparison should be taken with caution .",
    "the @xmath21 photometry of sn  2009bb is reported in table  3 . in figure",
    "[ fig2.3 ] , the near - infrared light curves of our sn are displayed together with those of sn  1998bw and sn  2002ap .",
    "as seen in the optical , the post - maximum evolution of sn  2009bb is slightly faster than that of sn  2002ap . in the case of sn  1998bw , the difference is larger , with the latter object being @xmath30.7 and @xmath30.2 magnitudes brighter than sn  2009bb in the @xmath22 and @xmath23 bands , respectively , at @xmath2450  days past @xmath2 maximum .",
    "is is worth mentioning that part of this difference could be due to host galaxy contamination affecting the sn  1998bw infrared photometry @xcite .    for each optical and near - infrared band , the time and value of peak magnitude was estimated from low - order polynomial fits .",
    "the results are reported in table  4 .",
    "similar to other sne  ib / c , maximum light occurs in the blue followed by the red bands .    in figure  [ fig2.0 ] , the count rates in the @xmath25 and @xmath26 uvot bands at the position of sn  2009bb are plotted .",
    "the fluxes were measured in a fixed aperture and , therefore , are the sum of the light coming from the sn and the background galaxy . from the plot ,",
    "it is clear that in the @xmath25 filter , the background flux is already dominant at @xmath24 6 days past @xmath2 maximum light . assuming that the count rate measured in the last three @xmath25 observations is entirely due to the background , the sn  2009bb flux in the first observation can be estimated by subtracting the weighted average of the flux in these last three observations from the total count rate .",
    "adding a zero point for the @xmath25 band of 17.49 @xmath3 0.03 @xcite , a value of 18.1 @xmath3 0.1 is obtained for the @xmath25 magnitude of sn  2009bb at @xmath24 6 days before @xmath2 maximum light .",
    "the de - reddened color curves of sn  2009bb are compared in figure  [ fig2.4 ] with those of sn  1998bw , sn  2002ap , sn  2006aj , and sn  2003jd . in the case of sn  2009bb , a color excess of e(@xmath27 ) = 0.58@xmath28 is assumed ( see section 3 ) , while for sn  1998bw , sn  2002ap , sn  2003jd , and sn  2006aj , values of 0.06 @xcite , 0.08 @xcite , 0.14 @xcite , and 0.18 @xcite , respectively , were adopted .",
    "it is worth mentioning that for all the latter sne most of the reddening is produced in the milky way .",
    "all the authors cited above assumed little or no reddening in the host galaxy due to the absence of strong interstellar na  i  d absorption in the sne spectra . since the correlation between na  i  d @xmath29 and reddening has been shown to have a significant dispersion @xcite , the reddening estimates for these sne should be taken with caution . to convert the color excesses to corrections for each band",
    ", we adopted an @xmath30 value of 3.1 @xcite .    as is seen in figure  [ fig2.4 ] ,",
    "the color evolution of broad - lined sne  ic show significant variations .",
    "this highlights the inadequacy of color indices to estimate host galaxy extinction for these events .",
    "the early phase @xmath31 color evolution of sn  2009bb is seen to be most comparable to that of sn  2003jd , while sn  1998bw is @xmath240.2 mag redder at early and late epochs , but is similar to sn  2009bb between + 10 and + 20 days . in the case of @xmath32 ,",
    "all sne have very similar evolution except for sn  2006aj which is @xmath240.2 redder .",
    "the @xmath33 color evolution of sn  2009bb is intermediate between sn  2002ap ( bluer ) and sn  2003jd ( redder ) .    in figure  [ fig2.5 ]",
    ", we compare the reddening - corrected @xmath34 and @xmath35 color curves of sn  2009bb with those of sn  2002ap .",
    "the evolution of the two sne is similar , but sn  2009bb is @xmath240.3 and @xmath240.5 mag bluer in @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "the short time interval between the chase images with negative and positive detection of sn  2009bb allows us to place strong constraints on its explosion date .",
    "this is done through the use of a simple equation describing an expanding fireball :    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the luminosity at time , @xmath38 , @xmath39 is a constant that defines the rate of the rise , n=1.8 @xcite , and @xmath40 is the time of explosion . applying the equation ( [ equa6 ] ) to the unfiltered light curve",
    ", we estimate that the explosion occurred on jd=2454909.6 @xmath3 0.6 , which corresponds to the time of of our non - detection of sn  2009bb .",
    "as demonstrated in figure  [ fig2.6 ] , the curve fits reasonably well the unfiltered light curve ( reduced @xmath41=3.1 ) , except for the epoch of first detection .",
    "to compute the absolute luminosity of sn  2009bb requires estimates of the host galaxy dust extinction and distance .",
    "one method to estimate the host reddening of sn  2009bb is to measure the balmer decrement from the spectrum of the region located beneath the sn . to this end",
    "we use the two sn  2009bb nebular spectra acquired on jan 9th and feb 3th 2010 . in these spectra",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio of the region is higher than in the spectra taken at earlier epochs , while the sn flux is lower , allowing for a more precise measurement of emission from the balmer lines .",
    "obtaining an accurate estimate of the h@xmath42 and h@xmath43 fluxes requires the removal of the light of the sn and any residual stellar contribution .",
    "this was accomplished by fitting a cubic spline to the underlying continuum in the spectrum .",
    "the resulting pseudo - continuum was then subtracted from the original spectrum . comparing the measured @xmath44 flux ratio obtained from",
    "the `` cleaned '' spectra to the values listed in @xcite ( for case b recombination , t=10000@xmath45 k ) and assuming the standard total - to - selective extinction ratio r@xmath46 = 3.1 , we obtain a total reddening ( host+milky way ) of @xmath47 = 0.59@xmath30.10 and @xmath47 = 0.57@xmath30.10 for the 2010  jan  9 and 2010  feb  3 spectra , respectively .",
    "there is another ( brighter ) region located @xmath24  0.3@xmath48 north , @xmath24  1.4@xmath48 east of the sn .",
    "a measurement of the balmer decrement from its spectrum gives a color excess of @xmath47 = 0.56@xmath30.10 , which is in good agreement with that obtained at the sn position .",
    "given the similarity of the three estimates , we will assume the total reddening suffered by sn  2009bb to be the average of the values obtained from its two nebular spectra , i.e. @xmath47=0.58@xmath30.07 .    an alternative method often used to estimate the reddening suffered along the line - of - sight to a sn is the equivalent width ( @xmath29 ) of the interstellar na  i  d absorption .",
    "the weighted average of the @xmath29 measured from seven of our low resolution spectra is @xmath49   .",
    "taking into account relation between the na  i  d ew and color excess reported in @xcite , a value of @xmath50 and @xmath51 is implied for the lower and higher slope , respectively .",
    "this confirms that sn  2009bb was significantly extinguished .",
    "nevertheless , since the na  i  d lines are almost certainly saturated , this value of @xmath52 should be taken as a lower limit only . combining the galactic reddening obtained from the infrared dust maps of @xcite , @xmath530.098 , and the host galaxy value , we obtain a lower limit of the total reddening of @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively , bracketing the reddening obtained from the balmer decrement .",
    "despite the relative proximity of ngc 3278 , there are no direct distance measurements to this galaxy reported in the literature .",
    "we therefore must resort to the recession velocity and hubble s law to compute the distance to sn  2009bb . in the remainder of this paper",
    "we assume a distance modulus of @xmath56 as given in the nasa / ipa extragalactic database ( ned ) .",
    "this value is obtained from a heliocentric velocity of 2961@xmath337 km  s@xmath57 @xcite , corrected for virgo infall and great attractor @xcite , and assuming @xmath58 km  s@xmath57  mpc@xmath57 @xcite . using the maximum light magnitudes reported in table  4 , and the previously mentioned values of reddening and distance",
    ", we compute absolute magnitudes for the various bands that are listed in table  4 .",
    "figure  [ fig3.1 ] shows the pseudo - bolometric light curve of sn  2009bb , together with sn  1998bw , sn  2002ap , sn  2003jd and sn  2006aj , obtained by integrating the absolute flux in the @xmath15 bands .",
    "the peak luminosity of sn  2009bb is found to be close to that of sn  2006aj , and @xmath2460% of that of sn  1998bw .    to estimate the @xmath5ni content and",
    "the ejected mass , we integrated the flux of sn  2009bb contained within the @xmath59 bands . also included was a @xmath39 band correction based on the sn  2002ap light curves @xcite .",
    "the resulting pseudo - bolometric light curve was then modeled making use of an analytical description for the peak of the light curve @xcite .",
    "the model assumes spherical symmetry , homologous expansion , no mixing of @xmath5ni , radiation - pressure dominance , and the applicability of the diffusion approximation for photons , which restricts it to early phases ( @xmath14 30 days post - explosion ) when the density is sufficiently high to make the ejecta optically thick .",
    "we also assume constant opacity @xmath60=  0.08  @xmath61 g@xmath57 as computed for sn  1997ef by @xcite .",
    "@xcite used a time variable opacity for modelling the sn  1998bw bolometric light curve which average value during the first 20 days after the explosion is @xmath60=  0.07  @xmath61 g@xmath57 .",
    "we assume the uncertainty on visible opacity to be the difference of the previously mentioned values i.e. 0.01  @xmath61 g@xmath57 . in @xcite model ,",
    "the time - evolution of luminosity is given by    @xmath62    where @xmath63 is the energy produced in 1 second by 1 gram of @xmath5ni , @xmath64=t/@xmath65 and @xmath66=@xmath65/2@xmath67 with @xmath67 being the @xmath68-folding time of the @xmath5ni decay and @xmath65 effective diffusion time , which determines the width of the bolometric light curve .",
    "if @xmath65 is expressed as a function of @xmath60 , the ejecta mass , @xmath69 , and the photospheric velocity , @xmath70 at time of bolometric maximum , the effective diffusion time can be written @xcite as    @xmath71    in addition to the m@xmath72 and m@xmath73 parameters , there is also an additional free parameter , t@xmath74 , which is the time interval between explosion and the peak of the bolometric light curve .",
    "finally , as proposed by @xcite , we include the contribution of the @xmath5co decay in equation [ equa3 ] .    in this analytic model ,",
    "the photospheric velocity at the time of the maximum of the bolometric light curve is an input parameter .",
    "the velocity derived from the minimum of the  @xmath756355 feature is often used as a proxy for the photospheric velocity .",
    "nevertheless , several studies have found that in sn ic the  @xmath756355 could be contaminated by other species like detached  @xmath756678 ,  @xmath756402 , detached h@xmath42 or detached  @xmath756580 @xcite .",
    "contamination from other ions could shift the minimum of the  @xmath756355 feature in different direction at different epochs , biasing the estimation of the photospheric velocity . in spite of these shortcomings",
    "the  @xmath756355 feature is still the most easy feature to measure , but a correction must be applied to derive a velocity as close as possible to the real photospheric velocity at a given epoch . to compute this correction we consider sn  1998bw , sn  2002ap and sn  2006aj , for which the evolution of the photospheric velocity was computed using the montecarlo code described in @xcite . comparing the velocities measured from the minimum of the @xmath756355 absorption with those derived through the spectra modelling mentioned above ,",
    "a difference of @xmath243000  km  s@xmath57   is found .",
    "assuming that this velocity shift also applies to sn  2009bb , we derive @xmath76 @xmath8 15000 @xmath3 1000  km  s@xmath57   at the time of the bolometric maximum light ( jd=2454923.1 @xmath3 0.7 ) .",
    "the analytical model then yields m@xmath73 = 0.22 @xmath3 0.06  m@xmath4 , m@xmath72 = 4.1 @xmath3 1.9  m@xmath4 and t@xmath74=11.3 @xmath3 0.8 days .",
    "the uncertainties in the latter quantities were computed through montecarlo simulations , taking into account the errors in the photospheric velocity , optical opacity , distance modulus , reddening and photometry .",
    "the resulting model is compared to the computed bolometric light curve in the insert of figure  [ fig3.1 ] .",
    "the ejecta mass and photospheric velocity allow us to estimate the kinetic energy associated with the 2009bb explosion by comparing the pseudo - bolometric light curve of sn  2009bb with that of sn  2002ap , for which detailed modelling have been already carried out @xcite . to compute the kinetic energy , equation  [ equa4 ]",
    "can be written as follows :    @xmath77    around maximum the pseudo - bolometric light curves of sn  2002ap and sn  2009bb are similar ( see the rescaled pseudo - bolometric light curve of sn  2002ap in the insert of figure  [ fig3.1 ] ) .",
    "the decline rate of sn  2002ap is slightly slower than sn  2009bb .",
    "around two weeks after @xmath2 maximum , which is the latest time we considered in the bolometric light curve fit , sn  2002ap reaches the same brightness of sn  2009bb @xmath24 3 days later than the latter sn .",
    "nevertheless , the rise to maximum of sn  2002ap seems to be faster than that of sn  2009bb .",
    "computing the rise time of the bolometric light curve as difference between the explosion date and the epoch on which the bolometric light curve reach the maximum , we obtain a rise time of @xmath24 13.5 and @xmath24 10 days for sn  2009bb and sn  2002ap respectively .",
    "we therefore can assume @xmath78 @xmath24 @xmath79 .",
    "taking into account that for sn  2002ap @xmath80 and @xmath81 = 4 @xmath3 1 @xmath82erg @xcite , for sn  2009bb we obtain @xmath83erg .",
    "radio observations of sn  2009bb spanning @xmath84 days after the explosion revealed evidence for an extraordinarily luminous , long - wavelength counterpart , with a spectral luminosity @xmath85 at @xmath86 ghz of @xmath87 @xcite . in comparison to the other @xmath88",
    "nearby sne ibc observed in the radio on a similar timescale , sn  2009bb is a factor of 10 to @xmath89 more luminous , rivaling the radio afterglow luminosities of the nearest grb - sne , including grb980425 associated with sn  1998bw @xcite .",
    "the multi - frequency radio observations were well described by a self - absorbed synchrotron spectrum , produced as the blast - wave shock - accelerated electrons in the local circumstellar medium . just as in the case of sn  1998bw , the high brightness temperature of the sn  2009bb radio counterpart required an unusually large emitting region and , in turn , a trans - relativistic blast - wave velocity , @xmath90 .",
    "moreover , the high radio luminosity implied a copious energy coupled to the fastest ejecta , @xmath91 erg .",
    "@xcite appealed to a model where this trans - relativistic ejecta component was powered by a different mechanism , a `` central engine '' ( rapidly - rotating and accreting black hole or magnetar ) , as is commonly assumed for long - duration grbs @xcite .",
    "this model can be tested using the bulk explosion parameters ( @xmath92 , @xmath93 ) for sn  2009bb derived from our well - sampled optical photometry and spectroscopy .",
    "analytic solutions for the distribution of ejecta in type ibc sne predict a steep coupling of energy and velocity within the homologously - expanding material ,    @xmath94    @xcite . based on an analysis of the optical dataset ( see section 3 ) , we find bulk ejecta parameters of @xmath95 erg and @xmath96 . within the homologous outflow",

    "this is _ at least _",
    "three orders of magnitude below the energy budget required to power the trans - relativistic radio emitting ejecta .",
    "we conclude that the luminous synchrotron emission from sn2009bb can not be explained in the framework of a homologous sn explosion and another energy reservoir ( i.e. a central engine ) is required to explain the distribution of ejecta within this relativistic sn .",
    "optical spectra of sn  2009bb were obtained on thirteen epochs spanning phases between @xmath02 and @xmath1285 days .",

    "around two week past maximum , the continuum has become similar to that of all the other comparison sne .    in terms of degree of broadening of the spectral features around maximum , the spectra of sn  2009bb are similar to those of sn  2006aj ( see figure  [ fig4.1 ] and [ fig4.2 ] ) .",

    "we explore qualitatively the presence of helium using synow , but it must be kept in mind that full spectral modeling , including non - thermal effects is necessary to study quantitatively the evolution and strength of the he lines @xcite .    the clearest evidence of the presence of helium in the sn  2009bb ejecta is found in the first two spectra taken at @xmath02 and @xmath01 days ( see figure  [ fig4.1 ] ) . a striking feature in these two spectra is the absorption around 5400   .",

    "indeed , an absorption corresponding to  @xmath756678 appears to be present and helps to fit the boxy profile of the line ( see figure  [ fig4.6 ] ) .",
    "there is also a weak feature corresponding to the expected position of  @xmath757065 , but contamination from  @xmath756929 can not be excluded .",

    "this feature is absent in the spectra of sn  2009bb , sn  1998bw and sn  1997ef , which is probably due to the broadness of the spectral features in the latter sne , that tends to wash out weak features .",
    "nonetheless , the absence of a clear feature in the sn  2009bb makes less plausible the possibility that in the earlier sn  2009bb spectra the absorption around 5500    is due to . as shown in figure  [ fig4.6 ] , with a detached velocity of @xmath24 23000 km  s@xmath57   gives a good fit to the observed line profile between 5000 and 5500  .",

    "unfortunately , due to the higher expansion velocity of the absorption features in sn  2009bb , the @xmath757065 line falls in the gap between the ccds , making its presence impossible to confirm .",
    "figure  [ fig4.4 ] shows a spectrum of sn  2009bb taken two weeks after @xmath2-band maximum .",

    "the emission redward of the absorption remains stronger in sn  2009bb compared to the the other sne plotted in this figure , but the profile around the absorption is now not so different suggesting a reduced strength of the blue wing of the @xmath755876 detached component . in both the @xmath133 and @xmath144 spectra of sn  2009bb",
    ", there also is no clear signature of the @xmath756678 and @xmath757065 features . it should be noted that in the rather noisy spectrum of sn  2007bg , the helium lines , if present , are not as strong as expected . in the case of helium - rich core - collapse sne",
    "( sne  ib ) , the features are stronger at these later epochs than at maximum ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "a possible explanation for the lack of strengthening of the absorption features in the case of sn  2009bb ( and perhaps also for sn  2007bg ) is that , due to the higher expansion velocity of broad - lined sne  ic together with a less massive helium shell , the mass of helium in the line forming region at these later epochs is likely much lower than in normal sne  ib .",
    "the evolution of the @xmath755876 velocity is summarized in the insert of figure  [ fig4.8 ] . before maximum he is undetached from the main line forming region , while after maximum is detached .",
    "this agrees with the finding of @xcite and @xcite for type ib sne .",
    "the velocity of the detached he decrease with time .",
    "the latter also agree with what obtained by @xcite .",
    "the fractional line depth of the @xmath757774 line can , in principle , be used to infer the presence of helium using the formula given by @xcite    @xmath100    where @xmath101 and @xmath102 represent the values of the continuum and of the line minimum at the wavelength of the minimum , respectively .",
    "the latter authors proposed that in sne  ib , due to the dilution of oxygen by helium , the @xmath757774 absorption should be weaker than in sne  ic .",
    "indeed , they measured an average fractional line depth of 0.27 @xmath3 0.11 and 0.38 @xmath3 0.09 for sne  ib and sne  ic , respectively .",
    "@xcite also found that this difference is stronger around maximum than at late time .",
    "unfortunately , in broad - lined sne  ic , the depth of the @xmath757774     is difficult to measure at early epochs due to the widths of the other lines in this spectral region . in figure",
    "[ fig4.7 ] , measurements at phases later than + 20 days are plotted . as for normal sn  ibc",
    "the fractional line depth for broad - lined sne  ic increases with time .",
    "interestingly , the two broad - lined sne  ic which show evidence of helium lines , sn  2009bb and sn  2007bg , have an @xmath757774 line depth that is less than those that do not show any sign of helium . note that figure  [ fig4.7 ] does not include sn  1998bw since , even at + 50 days , @xmath757774 is still strongly blended with the near - infrared triplet .      in figure  [ fig4.9 ]",
    "we show a comparison between the nebular spectra of sn  2009bb , sn  1997ef , sn  1998bw , sn  2002ap and sn  2006aj . to study the line profiles of sn  2009bb , the strong emission lines from the underlying region must be removed .",
    "this was achieved by subtracting the spectrum of the bright region located @xmath24  0.3@xmath48 north , @xmath24  1.4@xmath48 east of the sn position .",
    "the latter spectrum was acquired with the same spectrograph , making more accurate the spectra matching procedure .",
    "the spectrum of the bright region was rescaled to match the line fluxes of the region underlying the sn .",
    "note that the line ratios for the two regions are similar to within 10% .",
    "this , together with the very similar balmer decrement measured in the two regions ( see section 3 ) , gives confidence that the subtraction procedure has not significantly altered the sn spectrum .",
    "the nebular spectrum of sn 2009bb is rather noisy , but several strong emission features can be recognized .",
    "the emission in the blue , near 4500 , should be dominated by [ ] @xmath754570 .",
    "the broad complex near 5200   is the result of a number of [ ] emission lines .",
    "near 5900 ,  d emission is possibly detected .",
    "the two strongest lines in the spectrum are [ ] @xmath75@xmath756300 , 6363 and ] @xmath75@xmath757291 , 7324 .",
    "it is immediately clear that the calcium to oxygen ratio is much larger in sn  2009bb than in all the other comparison sne .",
    "it is also evident , when compared to the spectra of sne 2003jd and 1998bw , that the profile of the [ ] @xmath75@xmath756300 , 6354 emission in sn 2009bb is more similar to that of sn  1998bw than that of sn  2003jd ( see figure  [ fig4.10 ] ) .",
    "based on spectral modelling , @xcite claimed that a double peaked [ ] @xmath996300 , 6354 profile as observed in sn  2003jd is produced by an aspherical expansion , but viewed off axis . assuming that this interpretation is correct [ but see also @xcite ] , in the case of sn  2009bb , the material ejected must have been oriented close to the line of sight as in the case of sn  1998bw .",
    "the nebular spectrum of sn  2009bb can be modelled in order to derive some physical properties of the sn .",
    "nebular spectroscopy reveals the conditions of the innermost part of the sn ejecta , which are not visible when the sn is bright because they lie too deep in regions that are optically thick . at late phases , on the other hand , the inner parts of the sn are transparent , and behave like a nebula .",
    "the code we used computes the energy deposition from the decay of @xmath5ni to @xmath5co to @xmath5fe .",
    "these decays emit @xmath9-rays and high - energy positrons , which can deposit their energy in the sn ejecta and heat the gas by collision excitation .",
    "cooling then takes place via line emission .",
    "our code was described by @xcite , and is based on the description of @xcite .",
    "we model the spectrum of sn 2009bb using the simple , one - zone version of the nebular code .",
    "this assumes that the sn ejecta are spherical , and bound by an outer velocity , which reflects not so much the extent of the ejecta in radius or velocity ( the two are equivalent in the homologously expanding sn ejecta ) , but rather that of the region which is effectively heated and can therefore emit lines .",
    "this may be the result of decreasing density , distribution of @xmath5ni , or both .",
    "our model requires an outer velocity of 5500 km  s@xmath57 .",
    "this velocity appears to be adequate to fit all lines .",
    "this could be taken as an argument that sn  2009bb was not significantly aspherical . in models where more energy is released in a polar direction , leading to the synthesis of @xmath5ni and possibly to the production of a grb , the [ ]",
    "lines are broader than the [ ] line if the event is viewed close to the polar axis @xcite .",
    "otherwise , the [ ] lines are narrower than the [ ] line , which shows a characteristic double - peaked profile , as in sn  2003jd .",
    "nevertheless , the strongest evidence for asphericity in sn  1998bw was seen in nebular spectra obtained  200 days after maximum @xcite , while the difference between the iron and oxygen lines width was smaller at epochs of  340 days , which is closer to the epoch of the only nebular spectrum available for sn  2009bb .",
    "therefore , while from this spectrum only we do not infer major asphericities in sn  2009bb , we can not rule out that the signature of asphericity might have been seen in earlier nebular data .",
    "the @xmath5ni mass which is required to reproduce the spectrum , assuming a distance modulus of 33.0 and a reddening @xmath103 , is 0.25 m@xmath4 .",
    "this is in good agreement with the estimate of 0.22@xmath30.06 m@xmath4 found from modelling the pseudo - bolometric light curve .",
    "the mass of the elements used to generate the synthetic spectra are summarized in table  6 .",
    "we have presented uv , optical and near - infrared photometry , and optical spectroscopy of the broad - lined type  ic sn  2009bb . around maximum ,",
    "the spectra of sn  2009bb were similar to those of sn  2003jd and sn  2006aj .",
    "the expansion velocities of sn  2009bb are similar to these of sn  2006aj , but higher than those of sn  2003jd . at phases later than + 15 days , the broadness of the spectral features in sn  2009bb was intermediate between sn  1997ef and sn  1998bw .",
    "the slow spectroscopic evolution indicates that sn  2009bb had a massive envelope , and this is confirmed by the pseudo - bolometric light curve analysis . with a simple model that includes both the @xmath5ni and @xmath5co decay , and making use of analytic equations presented in @xcite , we obtain a @xmath5ni and ejected mass of 0.22@xmath30.06 m@xmath4 and 4.1 @xmath31.9 m@xmath4 , respectively .",
    "the resulting kinetic energy is @xmath104 foe .",
    "a similar @xmath5ni mass is obtained from the nebular spectrum modelling @xmath105 .",
    "an absorption feature is identified in the @xmath106 and @xmath107 day spectra around 5400     that we attribute to @xmath755876 forming at the photosphere .",
    "appears to be detached in the later spectra , with the absorption getting weaker with time .",
    "the latter evolution is odd compared to what is normally observed in sne  ib where helium lines become stronger after maximum .",
    "the weakening of the helium absorption could be due to a combination of the fast expansion characteristic of broad - lined sne and a less massive helium shell than in `` normal '' sn  ib .    the comparison between the kinetic energy carried away by the homologous expanding ejecta at @xmath97 and the energy inferred by the radio observations points to the need for an extra source of energy provided by a central engine .",
    "the modelling of the sn  2009bb nebular spectrum indicates that iron and oxygen lines can be reproduced with a synthetic spectrum where both elements have similar expansion velocities .",
    "this suggests that sn  2009bb ejecta structure was not significantly aspherical .",
    "nonetheless , considering the iron and oxygen lines evolution of sn  1998bw , we can not exclude that the signature of asphericity could have been detected in a sn  2009bb earlier nebular spectrum .",
    "the analysis of the [ ] @xmath996300 , 6354 reveals that , if the explosion was indeed aspherical , the orientation should have been similar to that of sn  1998bw .",
    "therefore , if a grb was produced during the sn2009bb explosion , it was below the threshold of the current generation of @xmath9-ray instruments . without a detected grb counterpart , sn",
    "2009bb represents the first engine - driven , relativistic supernova ever discovered by its optical emission alone .",
    "the presence of a relatively massive helium layer may have played a role on the failed grb detection , but a quantitative description of the helium shell is necessary to verify this hypothesis .    a special thanks to the gemini - south staff for their efforts in obtaining data for our spectroscopic program .",
