    "single electron devices made up of a confined nanostructure located in the vicinity of electrodes that act as electron baths constitute a viable alternative to traditional field effect transistors which are about to reach their physical minimum size in a few years @xcite . therefore , detailed study of these devices has accelerated recently aided by the tremendeous advances in nanotechnology during the past two decades . to this end , it is of critical importance to simulate the switching characteristics of these prototypes in the presence of realistic electron - electron and electron - phonon interactions to assess their suitability for large electrical circuits .",
    "early studies largely focused on the influence of the many - body kondo resonance on the transient electrical conductance and discovered that varios time scales @xcite emerge after sudden switching of the gate or bias voltage @xcite .",
    "these timescales are inherently related to the spin fluctuations that govern the amount of time required for full formation of the kondo resonance @xcite .",
    "moreover , it turns out that the van hove singularities in the electrode density of states can induce dramatic effects in transient conductance .",
    "damped oscillations arising from interference between the emerging kondo resonance and the singularities in the contact density of states have been initially reported using prototypical density of states for an asymmetrically coupled system @xcite .",
    "subsequent studies undertaken to make the theoretical predictions more realistic used the electrode density of states calculated via ab initio methods as an input in many body calculations and exposed beating phenomena in transient electrical conductance @xcite .",
    "kondo effect is probably the most elegant and exotic example of many body physics whose signature has been originally traced in magnetic impurities embedded in bulk metals as resistance enhancement at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "it took some four decades to unravel its existence in confined nanostructures like quantum dots @xcite and molecules @xcite .",
    "the underlying physical mechanism for the kondo effect is the spin flip processes taking place at low temperatures between an isolated spin at dot energy level and the fermi sea of electrons at electrodes .",
    "when the dot energy level lies below the fermi level , a sharp resonance develops around the fermi level and it causes an enhancement in current due to the opening of an extra transport channel .",
    "the linewidth of this resonance is on the order of an energy scale called the kondo temperature @xmath0 given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the half bandwidth of the conduction electrons and @xmath3 is the total coupling of the dot to the electrodes . in this paper , we will take @xmath4 .",
    "introducing a temperature gradient across the electrodes provides another intriguing and realistic path for investigation .",
    "the existence of kondo resonance can be checked directly via a measurement of the thermopower ( seebeck coefficient ) @xmath5 and the thermoelectric figure of merit @xmath6 which is directly related to the thermopower is a key indicator of the device s performance . some experiments in molecular junctions",
    "have recently probed this by adjusting the alignment of the impurity orbital with respect to the fermi level of the contacts and this has been found to result in a change of sign in thermopower @xcite .",
    "behaviour of the thermopower and figure of merit has been elucidated as a function of temperature both in kondo @xcite and mixed valence regimes @xcite .",
    "these studies were largely in line with the experimental work and confirmed the critical role the impurity energy level plays in the sign of thermopower . nevertheless , they were by no means sufficient to shed light on the thermal switching behaviour of these devices since they were performed in steady state .",
    "thermal switching will be required in practical applications to be able to operate the device at different thermoelectric figure of merit values .",
    "therefore , it is imperative to understand the behaviour of the thermal switch in transient region .",
    "first analysis of the thermopower in a time - dependent situation showed that the the inverse of the saturated decay time of thermopower to its steady state value is equal to the kondo temperature when kondo resonance emerges as a result of the sudden motion of the dot level to a position nearby the fermi level of the electrodes @xcite .",
    "later , ac driving of the dot level sinusoidally revealed complex fluctuations in instantaneous thermopower whose extreme values are quite sensitive to the amplitude of the oscillation @xcite .",
    "these studies utilized parabolic density of states for contacts and the effect of singularities on the instantaneous thermopower and figure of merit in kondo regime remains to be seen .",
    "it is our aim in this paper to fill this gap and investigate the behaviour of instantaneous thermopower and figure of merit for a quantum dot whose energy level is shifted to a position close to the fermi level of contacts .",

    "we will be ignoring the phonon contribution to the thermal conductance .",
    "this assumption is justified because we will be carrying out our calculations around the kondo temperature of the device which is only a few kelvins .",
    "phonon contribution to the thermal conductance can be safely ignored in this regime compared to the electronic one in contrast with some previous work where the system is outside kondo regime and the ambient temperature is several hundred kelvins @xcite .    in this paper , we will be concerned with the behaviour of instantaneous thermopower and figure of merit for a quantum dot whose energy level is shifted suddenly to a position close to fermi levels of contacts such that the kondo resonance can develop in this final state .",
    "we will have the chance to make a direct comparison between the effect of metal and graphene type electrodes on transient values of these quantities .",
    "this constitutes a fairly realistic model to simulate the thermal switching behaviour of single electron devices since electron - electron interactions are captured as well as the structure of the electrode material .",
    "hence , our investigation should shed light on design and implementation of these devices experimentally",
    ". our only limitation will be that our results will pertain to linear response only due to the validity of onsager coefficients in this regime .",

    "the components of this interference should be the two sharp features .",
    "these are nothing but the van hove singularity in the density of states of the electrodes and the kondo resonance in the dot density of states .",
    "this interference is enabled due to two factors .",
    "first , the density of states of the dot and the electrodes are mixed due to the hybridization term in the hamiltonian therefore the kondo resonance and the van hove singularity can interact even though they are not located in the same density of states .",
    "second , the development of the kondo resonance is gradual and it is fully formed only at the end of the long timescale @xcite implying that it is a dynamical time - dependent feature . on the other hand , the van hove singularity at the contact density of states is static and it does not evolve in time . consequently , the interference can take place between a dynamic and a static feature .",
    "it dies out once they both become static , hence we observe damped oscillations .",
    "the thermopower is related to the dot density of states at low temperatures via sommerfeld expansion which is given by @xmath61 in atomic units .",
    "@xmath62 corresponds to the value of the dot density of states at fermi level of the contacts and @xmath63 is its derivative .",
    "the formation of the kondo resonance has been previously shown to take place slightly above the fermi level @xcite giving rise to a positive derivative at fermi level .",
    "consequently , the overall sign of the thermopower in the final state is always negative .",
    "as the kondo resonance starts growing in the final state , the derivative begins to increase in magnitude . when the kondo resonance reaches its full form in the long timescale , the derivative stabilizes .",
    "this causes the thermopower to reach its steady state .",
    "the fundamental difference between the oscillations in the thermopower and the conductance reported previously lies in their start of occurrence and sensitivity to asymmetry .",
    "the thermopower oscillations start much earlier than the conductance oscillations because tiny fluctuations in the dot density of states at fermi level due to this interference are enhanced as a result of the derivative in sommerfeld expansion and thus manifest themselves in the thermopower at the onset of kondo timescale prominently . the insensitivity to asymmetry originates from the constructive interference of the right and left electrodes with the kondo resonance magnifying the effect even further .",
    "the destructive interference between the left and right electrodes diminishes the conductance oscillations gradually with increasing @xmath57 @xcite .",

    "a first glance at this figure reveals that the figure of merit is nonzero in initial state on contrary to the thermopower shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and fig .",
    "this can be understood by simplifying the figure of merit using the wiedemann - franz law .",
    "the ratio of the thermal conductivity to electrical conductivity is given by the wiedemann - franz law which can be expressed as @xmath64 where @xmath65 is a constant called the lorentz number .",

    "@xmath67    this obviously implies that the thermoelectric figure of merit can never be negative and is proportional to the square of the instantaneous thermopower which we just investigated .",
