    "starbursts , especially in dwarf galaxies , play a key role in understanding galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "a strong burst of star formation is expected to occur during the initial virialization and baryonic dissipational collapse of a proto - galaxy . in hierarchical cosmological scenarios ,",
    "the first systems to virialize ( at @xmath3 ) have masses similar to those of dwarf galaxies , which then merge to form larger galaxies ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "late epoch starbursts have been invoked to explain the excess of faint blue galaxies in the field ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and the increasing contribution of blue galaxies with @xmath4 in clusters ( @xcite ) .",
    "starburst driven galactic winds ( @xcite ) have a particularly important role in dwarf galaxy evolution .",
    "mass loss is easier in the shallow potential of a dwarf galaxy , so winds may play an important role in regulating the gas content of dwarfs ( @xcite ) . while the initial geometry of the ism is also important ( @xcite ) , and extended dark matter halos",
    "complicate the mass - loss predictions , it is unlikely that a dwarf galaxy can retain the hot ( @xmath5 k ) metal enriched gas that inflates the kpc scale  bubbles commonly seen in starburst dwarfs ( e.g.  @xcite )",
    ". hence , starburst driven winds , especially from dwarfs , play an important role in enriching the intergalactic ( and intra - cluster ) medium , while keeping the metal content of the remaining ism lower than closed - box model predictions .",
    "dwarf galaxies may contribute strongly to qso absorption line spectra , especially because of their winds , as well as their often - extended gaseous disks ( e.g.  ddo154 : @xcite ; ngc  2915 : @xcite ) .    while these issues illustrate the conceptual importance of starbursts and dwarf galaxies , our understanding of these objects are far from complete .",
    "two questions in particular , still are not resolved .",
    "firstly , what is the role of starbursts in dwarf galaxy evolution ? in some models a starburst is a singular event , which through rapid star formation and consequent galactic wind , transforms a gas rich dwarf irregular into a low surface brightness , gas poor system ( e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "hence starbursting dwarfs may be the link between gas rich and gas poor configurations .",
    "however observations of the stellar populations in even the lowest mass dwarfs show that they typically have had multi - episodic or an otherwise complex star formation history ( e.g.@xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "given the usual disk geometry of the ism , even in dwarfs , and the geometric arguments of de young &  heckman ( 1994 ; cf .",
    "@xcite ) , it is not clear that winds alone can sweep the ism out of a dwarf galaxy .",
    "this has also been discussed from an observational point of view by welch _",
    "et al _ ( 1998 ) .",
    "secondly , how do starbursts themselves evolve ?",
    "the theoretical concept is that starbursts have a very short duration .",
    "for example the fading dwarf model of babul and ferguson ( 1996 ) requires a burst duration @xmath6 myr . however observations of well known starbursts show them to be complex , consisting of multiple star clusters embedded in a dominant distribution of diffusely distributed high mass stars ( @xcite ) .",
    "can such structures be formed on such short timescales ?    in order to address these questions , we have commenced an observational study of nearby star - bursting dwarf galaxies . not only may these galaxies be the active link between gas - rich and gas - poor dwarf galaxy configurations but they are the most numerous type of starbursting systems , hence allowing investigation of relatively nearby systems ( e.g. within the virgo cluster distance : d @xmath7 16 mpc ) .",
    "starbursting dwarf galaxies go by several names . these include blue compact dwarf ( bcd ) ,  or emission - line galaxies , and amorphous galaxies .",
    "these names indicate slightly different selection criteria .",
    "for example thuan &  martin ( 1981 ) define bcds by low luminosity , small sizes , blue colors and an emission line spectrum , and thus is both a color and spectroscopic classification .",
    "the  galaxy classification is purely spectroscopic , based usually on prism surveys for emission line sources ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the `` amorphous '' classification introduced by sandage &  brucato ( 1979 ) is morphological .",
    "it is based on deep photographic imaging and requires an extended high surface brightness region in a host containing no spiral arms .",
    "hence amorphous galaxies resemble e or s0 galaxies , but typically have blue colors .    our sample of twelve starburst dwarfs ( @xmath8 )",
    "was selected primarily from blue galaxies classified as amorphous , or likely amorphous galaxies ( by @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) because these galaxies include some of the nearest starburst dwarfs known .",
    "two well known dwarf  galaxies , haro  14 , and ii  zw  40 , were also included to round out our observing time .",
    "the basic properties of the sample galaxies are listed in table [ tabstats ] .",
    "their proximity makes them an ideal class for studying starburst galaxies in detail .",

    "the energetics of the outflows were estimated and shown to be in accord with models of the young populations in the centers of these galaxies . in the first paper of this series ( marlowe _ et  al . _  1997",
    "; hereafter @xcite ) we presented the entire dataset on all the galaxies in the sample .",
    "the broad band images were used to construct surface brightness profiles , which show that these galaxies typically consist of a young blue core population , which we identify as the starburst , within an older redder envelope with an exponential radial surface brightness profile , which we identify as the underlying `` host '' galaxy .",
    "we also compared the global properties ( e.g.  magnitudes , colors ,  luminosities ,  fluxes , etc  ) of our sample with samples of non - bursting gas rich dwarf irregulars ( di ) , gas poor dwarf ellipticals ( de ) , as well as other samples of dwarf starbursts ( i.e.  bcd and  galaxy samples ) .",
    "while there were clear differences ( in the obvious sense ) in the global properties of our sample compared to des and dis , the differences with other dwarf starburst samples were small and could be traced to the original selection criteria .",

    "the surface brightness profiles of most of our sample ( 8/12 ) appear to have two components , an outer region that is roughly exponential , which we call the envelope , and an inner region in excess of this inwardly extrapolated exponential , which we call the core . in all cases",
    "we fit an exponential to the outer portion of the galaxies between @xmath11 ( where @xmath12 is the effective or half light radius in the @xmath13 band of the measured profile ) , and the outer limits of the photometry ( where the surface brightness is roughly twice the sky level uncertainty ) .",
    "the exponential fit has two parameters , the scale length @xmath14 , and the extrapolated face - on central surface brightness @xmath15 ( freeman , 1970 ) .",
    "for a pure exponential profile @xmath16 and @xmath17 mag .",

    "we caution that the core - envelope separation is prone to large systematic errors .",
    "consider first the effect of the apertures used to extract the profiles .",
    "in paper i ( appendix ) we showed that fits to surface brightness profiles derived from circular annuli when applied to a galaxy with elliptical isophotes will underestimate the central surface brightness and overestimate the scale length .",
    "such an error will also effects the core / envelope ratio . in the worst case ,",
    "haro 14 appears to have a core ( core / envelope @xmath19 ) in the circular annuli profile , but little or no core when elliptical annuli photometry is used ( paper i , fig .",
    "we do considerably better by using elliptical annuli photometry , because the isophotes are better approximated by ellipses . using variable ellipse parameters fitted to the isophotes yields profiles of higher fidelity ( with respect to the isophotes ) than those from averaged parameters .",
    "however it results in a conceptual problem : if the shape varies with radius what is the shape of the envelope where the core dominates ?",
    "for our sample the difference in total flux of the envelope is less than 15%  when results from variable and constant shaped ellipse parameters are compared , and there is no bias in the sign of the difference . hence we adopt the constant shaped elliptical annuli photometry for the exponential fits and the core - envelope separation .",
    "there is one exception to this : ii  zw  40 which is a merging dwarf system ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and has an `` @xmath20 '' morphology ( @xcite ) . for it",
    "we adopt the concentric circular annuli profiles centered on the brightness peak .",
    "the radial fit range ( set by the depth of the photometry ) also effects the results . as a worst case",
    "consider ngc  2915 , for which we derive @xmath21 ( @xmath13 band core / envelope flux ratio ) from our photometry . using the deeper photometry of meurer et al .",
    "( 1994 ) we derive @xmath22 . in this case",
    "the onset of the core is gradual , and the fit we present in @xcite includes part of the core seen in the meurer et al .  profile .",
    "better agreement is found for ngc  1705 , for which we derive @xmath23 , whereas meurer et al .",
    "( 1992 ) have @xmath24 . in summary ,",
    "mismatches in isophote shapes could cause a `` random '' error of @xmath25 in @xmath26 , while the limited depth of our photometry may result in the ratio being underestimated by @xmath27 in some cases .",
    "the latter effect will be smaller in the @xmath28 band where the core is weaker .",
    "as we are using the galaxy colors to make quantitative statements about the galaxy s age , we need to consider the effects of emission line contamination .",
    "while in some galaxies the corrections are negligible , in others , colors can be affected by as much as a few tenths of a magnitude .",
    "uv - optical spectra for six of our twelve galaxies , kindly provided by daniela calzetti ( see @xcite ) , were used to measure the equivalent widths of the emission lines that fall within each of our filters for these galaxies .",
    "the aperture size of the spectra is @xmath29 , which encompasses most of the cores in the galaxies .",
    "thus the correction would only be valid in the inner regions of the galaxy , so we only apply them to the core . excluding the exceptional case of ngc 1705 , the average value for the ratio of the half - light radii of the emission - line gas and optical continuum in these galaxies is about 50%",
    "( see paper i for details ) . since the gas is usually more compact than the starlight",
    ", we therefore make no corrections to the envelope colors .",
    "comparing the equivalent widths with the fwhm of the filter , and adjusting for throughput differences of the different emission lines , we estimate a correction for each filter :    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the correction to filter @xmath32 in magnitudes , @xmath33 is the equivalent width of emission line @xmath34 found in filter @xmath32 , fwhm@xmath35 is the full width at half maximum of filter @xmath32 , @xmath36 is the throughput of the filter at the wavelength of emission line @xmath34 , and @xmath37 is the average throughput of the filter within its fwhm bandpass .",
    "if we assume the corrections scale with the  equivalent width ( derived from our  images ) , and that ngc 5253 and ngc 3125 have line ratios that are typical of the sample , we can estimate the corrections for those galaxies for which we do not have spectra .",
    "of the remaining galaxies , ngc  2101 , haro  14 , and ii  zw  40 have   equivalent widths that suggest emission line contamination would be a significant problem .",
    "for haro  14 and ngc  2101 we estimate the corrections by assuming they have spectra similar to ngc 3125 .",
    "ii  zw  40 , however , has an exceptionally high   equivalent width ( @xmath38  in the central region ) , and may have very different line ratios .",
    "therefore we do not have much confidence in the accuracy of such corrections , and feel it best to make no attempt at correcting ii zw 40 without multiwavelength spectra .",
    "the final corrected core colors for haro 14 , ngc 2101 , ngc 3125 and ngc 5253 are given in table [ tabdcprop ] .",
    "the leitherer &  heckman ( 1995 ) stellar population synthesis models used below include the contribution from the nebular continuum ( see leitherer &  heckman 1995 text for discussion ) ; therefore we do not correct for nebular continuum contamination .",
    "our sample , primarily selected to consist of nearby blue dwarf amorphous galaxies , includes galaxies with a variety of morphologies .",
    "the dominant form is galaxies with smooth round outer isophotes and centrally concentrated star formation .",
    "these are ie or ne galaxies in the nomenclature loose &  thuan ( 1985 ) adopt for describing bcds . indeed they find that for bcds these are the most common types .",
    "our sample also includes ii  zw  40 a bcd/  galaxy with irregular structure at all radii ( type ii following @xcite ) . also in our sample are two highly inclined disk galaxies ( ngc  625 , ngc  3955 ) and one galaxy ( ngc  2101 ) with a morphology like a normal dwarf irregular , albeit of somewhat high surface brightness .    as we will discuss below , ( u  b ) colors bluer than about 0.4 are indicative of a strong starburst ( burst age younger than @xmath39 10@xmath40 years for continuous star - formation and younger than @xmath39 10@xmath41 years for an instantaneous burst ) .",
    "we find that this signature of a starburst is in most cases correlated with the galaxy surface brightness profile : galaxies whose core color ( u  b ) color indicates a starburst have the afore - mentioned core - envelope structure .",
    "those that do are ngc  1705 , ngc  2915 , ngc  3125 , ngc  4670 , and ngc  5253 .",

    ", only ngc  1510 and ngc  1800 are amorphous galaxies ( the others are all border - line amorphous galaxies judging by doubts expressed by sandage &  brucato [ 1979 ] or gallagher &  hunter [ 1987 ] ) .",
    "ngc  625 and ngc  2101 have considerably fainter effective surface brigthnesses than the other galaxies ( @xmath42 = 21.2 and 22.2 mag arcsec@xmath43 respectively - see paper",
    "note that we exclude from the above discussion ngc  3955 , which is much more luminous than the other galaxies ( @xmath44 ) , shows spiral arms ( contrary to the original definition of the amorphous classification ( @xcite ) , and whose central region is riddled by dust lanes whose associated obscuration affect its colors and radial surface brightness profile ( inducing an apparent plateau ) .",
    "we conclude that photometric indicators of a starburst ( the presence of a photometrically - distinct core whose colors are bluer than the envelope and are sufficiently blue to require a short - duration starburst ) are usually in satisfactory agreement with one another .",
    "these characteristics are present with a high incidence rate among bona fide amorphous galaxies .      in marlowe _",
    "et al _ ( 1995 ) we discussed h@xmath45 chelle spectroscopy that provided kinematic evidence for outflowing gas in seven of the galaxies in our present sample ( ngc  1705 , ngc  1800 , ngc  2915 , ngc  3125 , ngc  3955 , ngc  4670 , and ngc  5253 ) .",
    "in contrast , the galaxies haro  14 , ngc  625 , ngc  1510 , ngc  2101 , and ii  zw  40 did not reveal outflows .",
    "is there some connection between the presence or absence of an outflow and the structure or stellar content of the galaxy ( based upon our multi - color surface - photometry ) ?",
    "we exclude from consideration the luminous spiral ngc  3955 ( see above ) and ii  zw  40 ( for which we do not have reliable colors ) . of the remaining ten galaxies , the five with high effective surface brightnesses ( @xmath46 20 mag arcsec@xmath43 ) and whose cores have `` starburst colors''((u  b )",

    "this suggests that the condition needed for driving a large - scale outflow of ionized gas in a gas - rich dwarf galaxy is a transient ( 10 to 100 myr ) episode of star - formation in the galaxy core in which the rate of star - formation per unit area is also high .",
    "both the short timescale and high intensity of the star - formation are in accord with the usual definitions of starbursts and with theoretical understanding of starburst - driven outflows ( cf .",
    "maclow & ferrara 1998 ) .",
    "here we compare our sample to other samples of dwarf starburst galaxies , in order to determine to what degree our sample is representative of the dwarf starburst phenomenon",
    ". the comparison will primarily be with the samples of papaderos _",
    "et  al . _  ( 1996a , b ; hereafter p96 ) and telles ( hereafter t97 : @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the p96 sample was primarily selected from the thuan &  martin ( 1981 ) list of bcds , while the t97 sample was selected from _ the spectrophotometric catalog of  galaxies _ ( terlevich , 1991 ) .",
    "hence we are comparing our morphologically selected sample to samples of color and emission line selected dwarf starbursts .",
    "one concern is that the morphological selection may result in the less extreme , or older , starbursts since emission lines are not as important in the selection . if so , we may expect to see a difference in the burst strength , as parameterized by the core / envelope flux ratio , then seen in our sample",
    ". we may also expect our sample to have redder core colors .",
    "figure [ figcorefluxratio ] compares the ratio of the core to envelope fluxes of our sample in b versus @xmath48 against the p96 sample , and in i versus @xmath49 against the t97 sample . for the t97 sample",
    "the i core flux is estimated by subtracting the total luminosity derived from the exponential fit to the envelope from the galaxy total luminosity in those galaxies that showed a core component . while the i band is less sensitive to the massive stellar population , it is the only band in common with our sample for which the profile fits are available in the t97 sample . note the surface brightness profiles of the t97 sample were extracted using circular annuli and this may artificially induce an apparent central excess ( ` core ' ) in the surface - brightness profile ( see @xcite appendix for details ) .",
    "figure  [ figcorefluxratio ] shows two things .",
    "firstly , while some galaxies in the p96 and t97 samples have a stronger core / envelope flux ratio , there is nevertheless a strong degree of overlap between the samples .",
    "secondly , the cores do not totally dominate the galaxy .",
    "the cores in our sample galaxies with core - envelope structures amount to 0.2 to 1.1 mag brightening in the b band light , relative to the envelope alone . in the p96 sample",
    "the maximum ratio , 2.15 , corresponds to a 1.25 mag enhancement relative to the envelope alone .",
    "similarly , sudarsky & salzer ( 1995 ) report core enhancements of 0.2 - 0.6 mag in their sample of bcds .",
    "hence starbursts in dwarf galaxies represent only a modest @xmath50 1 magnitude enhancement to their pre - burst progenitors . even allowing for some downwards biasing in our core / envelope ratios due to the limited depth of our photometry ( see  [ secdata ] )",
    "the cores represent a @xmath50 1.5 magnitude enhancement .    in figure [ figcoreenv]a we compare the absolute magnitude of the core with the size ( scale length ) of the envelope for our sample and the p96 sample .",
    "here the two samples form a sequence , with brighter cores forming in larger galaxies .",
    "similarly , figure [ figcoreenv]b shows that brighter cores are associated with brighter underlying galaxies ( envelopes ) . to some degree ,",
    "both these correlations reflect a selection effect : bright or large underlying galaxies with weak or absent starburst cores certainly exist ( even in our sample - e.g. ngc  625 , haro  14 , ngc  2101 ) , but are harder to distinguish .",
    "thus , the absence of points in the upper right ( lower right ) of figure [ figcoreenv]a ( figure [ figcoreenv]b ) is a selection effect . on the other hand ,",

    "a more significant problem with the t97 sample is that the structural parameters for this sample were derived from circular aperture profiles .",

    "selection effects aside , could a measurement bias cause the segregation of types in fig .",
    "[ figdiskprops ] ?",
    "the concern is that a low surface brightness envelope would be difficult to detect , with the available photometry , if a strong burst were present .",
    "this is unlikely to be a significant effect since neither our sample nor those of p96 nor t97 contain ` bare cores ' ( i.e. an envelope is always detected around the bright blue starburst core ) .",

    "we assume a double exponential structure for burst plus envelope .",
    "we take @xmath87 pc , @xmath88 for the burst , and vary the envelope structural parameters .",

    "deeper observations and more detailed simulations would be useful for limiting and characterizing the envelope measurement biases .    we are left with the result that there is a real difference between the envelope structure of starburst dwarfs and dwarf irregulars .",
    "could this be due to a dynamical response of the envelope to the starburst core ? if a di where to have a central burst , gas will have to accrete into the center .",
    "the response of the envelope to the increased potential will be a contraction , and consequently an increased surface brightness .",
    "conversely , a wind associated with the starburst will expel mass from the center , and the stellar distribution will expand and fade in surface brightness in response . for a fractional change of mass @xmath99 , the expansion / contraction factor @xmath100 if the mass loss / gain occurs on a timescale much less than the dynamical time , and @xmath101 if the mass loss / gain occurs on a timescale much greater than the dynamical time ( @xcite ) . considering the fairly long core star formation timescales we derive ,",
    "it is likely that the mass loss or gain is slow .",
    "the problem is that for evolution between dis and starburst dwarfs we need @xmath102 , or @xmath103 .",
    "this huge change in mass does not seem feasible .",

    "the new estimates are shown in table [ tabmechlum ] , which also includes the estimates for those galaxies that do not have any evidence of large scale outflows .",
    "the main conclusions of marlowe _",
    "et  al . _  ( 1995 ) are not changed significantly by these new energy estimates : the mechanical luminosities of the present bursts are insufficient to remove large amounts of gas from the galaxies in our sample , but _ are _ sufficient to drive the large - scale expansion seen in the h@xmath45 bubbles and to allow much / most of the newly - created metals to be ejected from the galaxy : adopting the termin0logy of @xcite and @xcite , the bursts can accomplish `` blow out '' , but not `` blow away '' .",
    "second , it should be remembered that dwarf galaxies are dark matter dominated .",
    "both di and starburst dwarfs are known to have dark matter halos dominating even into the optical face of the galaxy ( e.g.  ddo 154 : @xcite ; ngc  2915 : @xcite ) .",

    "et  al._(1994 ) : at the peak of its star formation burst the system would look like a strong core / envelope system such as ngc  1705 , while before or after the burst it would like a weak core system such as haro 14 , ngc  625 , or ngc  2101 .",
    "that is , we would expect the class of amorphous galaxies to contain systems in both the ` burst ' ( strong blue core ) and ` inter - burst ' ( weak / absent core ) states .",
    "such galaxies might cycle between these two states intermittently until the gas is used up or expelled ( see below ) .",
    "since the starburst cores seem to involve only a few percent at most of the total galaxy stellar mass , there is no strong constraint on the duty cycle ( e.g. the galaxy could go through many such weak bursts and spend much of its time in this phase ) .",

    "the fractional number density of bursting dwarfs is about 1/3 .",
    "this suggests that starburst dwarfs at @xmath106 are `` on '' about 1/3 of the time . with a typical burst duration of @xmath107 yr",

    "thus , over 10 gyr , a galaxy could conceivably burst about 10 times , with a total star forming time of a few @xmath109 years .",
    "this is on the order of the gas consumption times seen in most blue amorphous galaxies ( cf .",

    "there is a correlation between dark matter halo central density @xmath111 and galaxy surface brightness - low surface brightness dis have low @xmath111 ( @xcite ) while high surface brightness starburst dwarfs have high @xmath111 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in both cases the dm dominates , even into the centers of the galaxies .",
    "if efficient star formation , i.e. a burst of star formation , occurs when a disk becomes unstable to self gravitation and forms stars on the shortest possible timescale - the dynamical timescale , then we expect the surface brightness of the starburst @xmath112 ( @xcite ) .",
    "a ( weak ) correlation in this sense is also observed for starbursts in normal systems ( @xcite ) .      in the previous section ,",

    "dwarf ellipticals are the most likely candidates for the ultimate end product of a starbursting dwarf that loses all its gas .",
    "this possible evolutionary link has long been proposed ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the envelopes currently seen in most blue amorphous galaxies are too bright and too blue to be de envelopes ( however cf .",
    "ngc  2915 ) .",
    "starburst dwarf envelopes are consistent with constant star formation for several gyr .",
    "if this star formation were turned off , however , after another several gyr , the blue amorphous galaxy envelopes would fade several magnitudes and become redder .",
    "for example , a standard bruzual & charlot ( 1996 ) model ( salpeter imf from 0.1 to 125 m@xmath113 with 40% solar metallicity ) for star - formation with a duration of 3 to 10 gyr will fade by by about 2.4 magnitudes in the next 10 gyr if star - formation is shut off .",
    "this would bring starburst dwarf envelopes well into the @xmath15 regime of des ( fig [ figdiskprops ] and fig .",
    "[ figdiskprops2 ] ) .",
    "a fraction of the des in the caldwell &  bothun ( 1987 ) sample have cores , and are designated as `` nucleated '' des .",
    "we plot the scale length versus @xmath114 and @xmath114 versus @xmath115 for these galaxies along with starburst dwarfs in figure [ figdecores ] .",
    "there is more scatter for des , which is what one might expect if they are faded compact galaxies : the scale length would not change drastically , though the core magnitude would .",
    "the apparent lower limit to the scale length for des probably corresponds to a selection effect and seeing limitation since all these galaxies are in the virgo and fornax clusters .",
    "if the cores of the amorphous galaxies and bcds fade enough , the faded galaxies will move into the area occupied by these nucleated des .",
    "the @xcite models predict that after 10 gyr , a 0.1 gyr duration burst will fade about 6 magnitudes .",
    "thus , if we were to shut off the star - formation for 10 gyr in both the core and envelope of one of these starburst dwarfs , the stronger differential fading of the core ( 6 magnitudes ) vs. the envelope ( 2.4 magnitudes ) would move the galaxy along the core vs. envelope sequence in figure [ figdecores]b from the domain of the starburst dwarfs into the domain of the nucleated des .",
    "however , the fading of the core will not be so dramatic if cores result from repeated weak bursts rather than a single strong burst ( the limiting case of many weak bursts will approximate a constant star - formation rate , which would then fade by only 2.4 magnitudes in 10 gyr - see above ) .",
    "the major problem with starburst dwarfs evolving into des is gas removal .",
    "as previously noted , the mechanical luminosity of the cores is insufficient to remove all the ism ; at least not over the core star formation timescale .",
    "there is also the problem that dwarf ellipticals are found predominantly in clusters ( @xcite ) , while starburst dwarfs are more numerous in the field ( @xcite ) .",
    "one way around these problems is to have multiple bursts .",
    "the ism consumed in star formation and ejected in winds would then be multiplied by the number of bursts . in clusters , evolution would occur at a more rapid pace as there are more frequent perturbing `` triggers '' .",
    "in addition , ram pressure stripping of the ism will play a more important role in clusters .",
    "this might explain the environmental differences between des and starburst dwarfs .",
    "the multiple burst scenario can also explain the correlation seen in des between exponential envelope color and the core strength shown in fig .",
    "[ figcorr ] .",
    "this correlation is in the sense that brighter cores have redder envelopes , opposite in sense to what is seen for starburst dwarfs .",
    "caldwell &  bothun ( 1987 ) attribute this to metallicity effects : des that have undergone multiple bursts before fading have accumulated more metals in the galaxy than those with fewer bursts .",
    "multiple bursts would also build up the core strength as low mass stars from previous bursts would continue to contribute light to the core .",
    "it may not be possible to have such a correlation from cores formed in a single burst , since this would involve a much stronger burst , one more likely to expel a metal enriched ism in a wind .",
    "we conclude that while it is possible in a photometric or purely phenomenological sense for the evolutionary endpoint of starburst dwarfs to be des , there is no compelling reason to expect that _ typical starburst dwarfs in the present cosmological epoch _",
    "( such as those we have studied in this paper ) will follow this pathway any time soon .",
    "in fact , we have argued that these starbursting dwarfs are experiencing rather mild recurring events , so that the depletion / loss of gas ( and the resulting cessation of star - formation ) will occur slowly . turning this around ,",
    "since the progenitors of present - day des were star - forming gas - rich dwarfs that succeeded in consuming / ejecting / losing their ism , these progenitors must have undergone bursts of star - formation that were considerably more intense than the bursts seen in typical bcds today .",
    "our analysis of blue amorphous galaxies shows that their surface brightness and color profiles typically consist of a young burst occurring in an older , enveloping population ( @xcite ) . the underlying galaxy surface brightness profile ( which dominates beyond about 1.5 times the half - light radius ) is consistent with an exponential profile .",
    "the young burst can be characterized by a central excess ( the core ) of this exponential profile .",
    "some objects loosely classified as starburst dwarfs ( our sample and others ) instead have a purely exponential or central plateau structure , instead of the more common core - envelope structure . in these `` coreless '' objects",
    "there is little if any color gradient - the colors throughout are consistent with a roughly constant star - formation rate over the last few gyr .",
    "we show that the underlying galaxies in our sample have colors consistent with roughly constant star formation over a hubble time .",
    "the cores are younger and have broadband colors consistent with ages of @xmath10 myr if formed in an instantaneous burst or @xmath80 myr if they result from a constant rate star formation .",
    "most cores have  equivalent widths more consistent with the constant star formation rate models .",
    "the core typically provides about half the light of the galaxy , and comprises a few percent of the stellar mass , as derived from our population models ( table [ tabages ] ) we thus conclude that the burst is a relatively modest event in the life of the underlying galaxy .",
    "these bursts are unlike the short duration dominant bursts hypothesized to occur in dwarf galaxies ( @xcite ) in order to explain the faint blue galaxy problem .",
    "the properties of our sample of predominantly morphologically selected dwarf starbursts has a high degree of overlap with those of other dwarf starburst samples , i.e.  those going by the monikers bcd and galaxies .",
    "they have similar core colors , envelope colors , equivalent widths , core to envelope flux ratios , and envelope structural parameters .",
    "hence we conclude that all these starburst dwarf samples represent the same basic physical phenomenon : recent and intense high mass star formation occurring in a redder and presumably older host .    our study and the similar studies of telles _",
    "et  al . _",
    "( 1997a , b ) and papaderos _",
    "et  al . _",
    "( 1996a , b ) show that the structure of the envelope is different from the exponential profiles of most di galaxies : starburst dwarfs mostly have face - on central surface brightness @xmath116 , while dis have @xmath117 . on average",
    "the difference in @xmath118 between di and starburst dwarfs amounts to @xmath119 . while measurement bias is a concern ( it is difficult to detect a compact low surface brightness envelope in the presence of a dominant starburst ) ,",
    "these studies have explored enough of parameter space that low surface brightness envelopes to starburst dwarfs should have been detected if they existed . instead only high surface brightness envelopes have been found .",
    "the large change in the structure of a di required to transform it into a starburst dwarf envelope makes it unlikely that that such a transformation can occur as a dynamical response to the formation of the starburst core .",
    "hence it is unlikely that typical dis are the progenitors of starburst dwarfs .",
    "instead it appears that episodes of star formation occur in both low surface brightness and high surface brightness hosts with the intensity of the star formation episode correlated with the host surface brightness . only in high surface brightness hosts",
    "do these episodes reach a high enough intensity to be classified as a `` starburst '' .",
    "we believe that the most likely progenitors ( and immediate evolutionary descendants ) of the starburst dwarfs are the `` coreless '' galaxies discussed above ( which may be the same population as the members of the di class with the highest surface brightness ) .",
    "these have envelopes like those of the starburst dwarfs but do not exhibit a very blue starbursting core .",
    "even though they populate lists of `` starburst '' galaxies , we believe this is a misnomer : they enter catalogs because they are moderately blue and are actively forming stars , and have much higher surface - brightnesses than typical dis .",
    "since the bursts we have studied are modest events involving only a few percent of the stellar mass , high - surface - brightness gas - rich dwarfs could cycle between burst ( strong core ) and quiescent ( weak / absent core ) multiple times with a fairly large duty cycle ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) until they use up or expel the remaining gas .    ultimately the gas supply will be exhausted ( and the star formation will then cease ) .",
    "the envelope properties would then fade on a timescale of gyr into the region of the @xmath48log@xmath120 plane populated by des .",
    "one possible way to shut off star formation would be if the burst in the core blew away the ism .",
    "this does not appear to be energetically feasible in a single burst .",
    "in addition the typical disk  geometry of dwarf galaxies makes it more difficult to blow out large a large fraction of the ism ( cf .",
    "an alternate method of turning starburst galaxies into gas poor des is through multiple bursts of star formation that both consume and expel the ism until it is totally gone .",
    "if galaxies undergo bursts for about 1/3 of their lifetime ( as suggested by the data in @xcite ) , most of the galaxies in this sample could turn their current hi gas into stars in about @xmath121 years .",
    "thus , this evolutionary path is a slow one ( typical starburst dwarfs in the present cosmological epoch will not start down the final path to de status any time soon ) .",
    "conversely , since present - day des most certainly did evolve from gas - rich dwarfs that experienced one or more intense bursts of star - formation in the distant past , these bursts must have been more powerful than the events occurring in typical present - day dwarfs .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee and the scientific editor , greg bothun , for their thoughtful and useful comments .",
