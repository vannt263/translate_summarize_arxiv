    "the earth occultation technique is simply measuring the change in total count rate in a non - imaging detector when an x - ray source rises above or sets below the earth s horizon , due to the spacecraft orbital motion .",
    "this produces a step - like feature in the data , illustrated in figure  [ f : step ] .",
    "this technique , described in detail in harmon et al .",
    "( 2002)@xcite , was used very successfully with the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) on the compton gamma ray observatory to monitor a catalog of 179 sources , of which 83 where definitely detected .",
    "this catalog included 32 stellar mass black hole systems of which 23 were definitely detected , including 3 newly discovered systems , and 12 agn sources of which 6 were definitely detected .",
    "details of the batse catalog can be found in harmon et al .",

    "the energetic x - ray imaging survey telescope ( exist ) is a mission concept for the beyond einstein black hole finder probe @xcite .",
    "the current design concept is shown in figure  [ f : exist ] .",
    "its primary mission will be to study obscured active galactic nuclei and gamma ray bursts .",
    "the main instrument , the high energy instrument , is a coded mask telescope with @xmath1 m@xmath2 of cadmium - zinc telluride ( czt ) detectors in the focal plane .",
    "it will be sensitive to photons in the 10 - 300 kev range . in this poster",
    "we propose using the csi side shields as earth occultation detectors to supplement the energy range and time coverage of the main instrument .",
    "the high energy instrument on exist will consist of a @xmath3 array of sub - telescopes , one of which is shown in figure  [ f : subt ] .",
    "honeycomb side panels and both active and passive shields will be shared by adjacent sub - telescopes .",

    ".comparison of exist and batse [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ t1 ]",
    "to estimate the sensitivity of the exist csi side shields for earth occultation measurements , we scaled the batse large area detector ( lad ) count rates from a typical interval outside of south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) passage by the ratio of the csi side shield area ( 2.31 m@xmath2 ) to the area of 1 batse lad ( 0.2025 m@xmath2 ) . next we generated a time series of random background rates , using the 16 batse energy channels .",
    "we then fit these rates with the following model : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the source flux in photons @xmath6 s@xmath7 ; @xmath8 is the angle to the source ; @xmath9 is the geometric detector area ; @xmath10 is the detector efficiency ; @xmath11 is the atmospheric transmission function ; @xmath12 are coefficients of a simple quadratic fitted to the background rate ; and @xmath13 is the occultation time of the source .",
    "the atmospheric transmission function , @xmath11 , depends on the mass attenuation of gamma rays in air , and the air mass along the line of sight at a given altitude , which in turn depends upon the precise position of the spacecraft . for exist we simply used an atmospheric transmission function from batse .",
    "the assumed exist csi shield detector efficiency was given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the energy dependent mass attenuation coefficients for csi and the honeycomb panels , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the densities of csi and the honeycomb panels , and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the thickness of csi and honeycomb panels .",
    "we used 1 csi layer ( @xmath21 cm ) and 1 honeycomb panel ( @xmath22 cm ) for energies up to about 200 kev . above 200 kev",
    ", we assumed all 4 csi layers were used ( @xmath23 cm ) and that the photons passed through 7 honeycomb layers ( @xmath24 cm ) .",
    "the sensitivity is then given by @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the computed error on the source flux @xmath5 . in our case",
    "we chose n=3 to obtain 3 @xmath0 sensitivity estimates , shown in figure  [ f1 ] .",
    "our estimates show that we should reach flux levels in about a day with exist that took an entire 2 week pointing with batse and similarly , in about 1 year we should reach levels comparable or better than those obtained over the entire batse mission .",
    "we used a very rough approximation for the background in the exist csi side shields , obtained by simply scaling the average background in a batse lad by area , to estimate the earth occultation sensitivity for exist .",
    "one should keep in mind that our estimates especially at the low and high ends will be affected by materials in close proximity to the detector . at low energies",
    ", we have assumed an 8 mm thick honeycomb panel with a density of 0.5 g @xmath27 sandwiching each shield . at high energies",
    ", we simply scaled the batse rates , assuming that the spacecraft materials are similar for batse and exist .",
    "the background levels at high energies are due to cosmic rays interacting in materials near the detectors .",
    "more detailed background estimates are needed to better determine earth occultation sensitivity for exist .",
    "the czt coded mask imaging system on exist will provide more sensitive measurements of sources especially at energies below 300 kev .",
    "our earth occultation measurements will complement these measurements , providing additional time coverage when sources are outside the field of view of the main instrument .",
    "this may prove important especially for rapid or short lived events , such as the rise of a transient stellar mass black hole outburst .",
    "in addition this technique will complement the energy range of the czt detectors , providing coverage at energies where the czt detectors have low efficiency ."
