    "brane tilings@xcite are two - dimensional diagrams drawn on tori which are used to represent the structure of a large class of quiver gauge theories .",
    "they can be used to describe arbitrary @xmath0 superconformal field theories realized on d3-branes in toric calabi - yau cones .",
    "they are dual graphs of corresponding quiver diagrams , and vertices and edges in a graph represent @xmath1 factors in the gauge group and chiral multiplets belonging to bi - fundamental representations .",
    "the graphs are bipartite .",
    "namely , vertices are colored black and white , and any pair of vertices connected by an edge have different colors .",
    "the orientation of edges are determined according to the colors of vertices at the endpoints .",
    "we take it from black to white . because @xmath1 factors correspond to faces ,",
    "it is natural to represent a bi - fundamental field @xmath2 as an arrow connecting two adjacent faces for two @xmath1 factors coupling to @xmath2 .",
    "the orientation of arrows , which specifies one of @xmath3 or @xmath4 , is also determined with the colors of vertices .",
    "we take the convention that if the orientation of an edge is south to north the orientation of the arrow intersecting with the edge is east to west .",
    "the head and tail of an arrow correspond to the upper color index for the fundamental representation and the lower color index for the anti - fundamental representation , respectively ( figure [ orientation.eps ] ) .",
    "the important feature of brane tilings is that they are directly related to the topological structure of fivebrane systems realizing the gauge theories , as is clarified in @xcite .",
    "we can regard the torus on which a bipartite graph is drawn as a stack of d5-branes , and edges in the bipartite graph as ns5-branes intersecting with the d5-branes .",
    "we can reconstruct the worldvolume of the ns5-brane by attaching semi - infinite cylinders to the torus along zig - zag paths in the diagram .",
    "a zig - zag path is a path made of edges in a bipartite graph defined so that when we go along the path we choose the leftmost edge at white vertices and the rightmost edge at black vertices .",
    "we can regard a bipartite graph as the superposition of zig - zag paths .",
    "because every edge is included in two zig - zag paths , each edge can be regarded as a part of the intersection of d5-branes and ns5-branes .",
    "we label four dimensions in which the gauge theory lives by @xmath5 , and the two cycles in the torus by @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the orientation of branes in the system is shown in table [ branes.tbl ] .",
    ".the structure of fivebrane systems represented by brane tilings . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the superpotential is given by @xmath8 on the web - diagram , all the three facets are wrapped by @xmath9 flavor branes .",
    "the major branes are wrapped on two facets and the minor branes are wrapped on the other .",
    "this means that by taking t - duality we obtain d7-branes wrapped on the same divisor as the case of the first example .",
    "the difference between two brane configurations is wilson lines on the d7-branes . in the fivebrane system",
    "the position of flavor branes on the @xmath10 is different .",
    "this difference is transformed by the t - duality to the difference of the wilson lines on the d7-brane worldvolumes .",
    "the effect of the wilson lines may be interpreted as a mass deformation of the theory .",
    "we can indeed deform the first example into the second one by adding the following quark mass term to the superpotential ( [ w1 ] ) : @xmath11 if we eliminate @xmath12 and @xmath13 from @xmath14 by using the f - term conditions and identify @xmath15 and @xmath16 with @xmath17 and @xmath18 we obtain the superpotential ( [ w2 ] ) for the second example .",
    "finally , let us consider an example with o5-planes .",
    "as is pointed out in @xcite , it is easy to make models leading to dynamical supersymmetry breaking by orientifolded brane tilings . as examples they give two brane realizations of the supersymmetric georgi - glashow model@xcite .",
    "figure [ ex1.eps ] shows fivebrane diagrams of one of the models based on @xmath19 geometry .",
    "this fivebrane diagram includes six hexagonal faces with integers @xmath20 , @xmath20 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath6 , and @xmath6 assigned to each .",
    "these faces give the gauge group @xmath22 .",
    "we also have @xmath23 from the fixed point at the center and @xmath24 from the contacting point of the @xmath25 face and the @xmath26 face .",
    "the d5-brane charge is conserved without introducing any flavor branes , and we have no more extra fields .",
    "in this paper we investigated orientifold of brane tilings from the perspective of fivebrane systems . among several possibilities , we only discussed orientifold with o5-planes which are represented as points in bipartite graphs .",
    "we showed that the cancellation of witten s @xmath27 anomaly and gauge anomaly are guaranteed by the conservation of d5-brane charge .",
    "the fact that the o5-plane rr - charge flips at the intersection with ns5-brane plays the key role to explain the gauge anomaly cancellation .",
    "the charge conservation requires the emergence of appropriate flavor branes , which do not necessarily coincide with the o5-planes , to compensate for the change of the o5-plane charges .",
    "these flavor branes provide quark fields which cancel the gauge anomaly generated by symmetric or antisymmetric representation fields .",
    "in section [ cy.sec ] we investigated the relation between fivebrane systems to calabi - yau cones .",
    "we gave the formula for @xmath27 parity of mesonic operators in terms of rr - charges of o5-planes , and establish the relation between rr - charge and t - parity .",
    "we also gave quark mass terms which reproduce the world volumes of flavor branes in toric calabi - yau cones as the massless loci of quark fields .",
    "all these are quite remarkable , but still there are many open questions .",
    "as we mentioned above , we only investigated the case of orientifold with o5-planes .",
    "there are , however , other possibilities with o7-planes .",
    "the matter contents for such case is given in @xcite , and similarly to the o5-brane case , we need fundamental matter fields to cancel gauge anomaly .",
    "the emergence of flavor branes should be guaranteed by some consistency in the brane system and it is important to clarify how the quark fields arise in these models .    in  [ cycone.sec ] , we restrict our attention only to rr - charge assignments with positive total charge .",
    "( total charge is the product of rr - charges of four o5-planes . ) from the fivebrane perspective , it seems also possible to consider rr - charge assignments with negative total charge .",
    "these two possibilities can be distinguished by two @xmath27 invariant value of the integral @xmath28 the invariance under the orientifold flip @xmath29 restrict this value to be @xmath20 or @xmath30 mod @xmath31 . as is clarified in @xcite , this parameter",
    "is related to the @xmath32-deformation in the gauge theory .",
    "it may be interesting to investigate the relation between the brane configurations with negative total rr - charge and @xmath32-deformation in gauge theories .    in general ,",
    "the gauge theories realized by the fivebrane systems are not conformal .",
    "such gauge theories without conformal symmetry are known to enjoy phenomenon so - called duality cascade@xcite .",
    "it is known@xcite that type iia brane construction of @xmath0 gauge theories provides simple way to realize seiberg duality@xcite in a geometric way",
    ". it would be interesting to study the phenomenon by using the fivebrane systems investigated in this paper .",
    "construction of models of dynamical susy breaking from orientifolded brane tilings is an extremely interesting issue , considering its phenomenological interest .",
    "our analysis clarified the structure of the fivebrane system realizing the model proposed in @xcite .",
    "we need to consider non - trivial flow of flavor d5-brane charges along ns5-branes .",
    "alternatively , we can use metastable susy breaking@xcite . in un - orientifolded case",
    "it is shown that we have metastable vacuum by the inclusion of flavor branes@xcite , and we expect existence of metastable vacua in orientifolded case as well .",
    "finally , it would be interesting to consider application to mirror symmetry for calabi - yau orientifolds , since in the un - orientifolded case , brane tilings are quite useful in proving homological mirror symmetry@xcite .",
    "we expect several differences , such as that @xmath33-structures are replaced by @xmath34-structures in orientifold case@xcite , but the basic line of argument should be similar .",
    "we hope to return to these topics in the future .",
    "we would like to thank f. koyama for valuable discussions .",
    "y.  i. would also like to thank osaka city university research group for mathematical physics for the oppertunity of giving a lecture about brane tilings .",
    "y.  i. is partially supported by grant - in - aid for young scientists ( b ) ( # 19740122 ) from the japan ministry of education , culture , sports , science and technology .",
    "in this sections we prove three formulae , originally labeled ( [ ocu5 ] ) , ( [ ocu12 ] ) , and ( [ ocu13 ] ) .",
    "the first formula ( [ ocu5 ] ) is @xmath35 the second formula ( [ ocu12 ] ) says if @xmath36 is a @xmath27 symmetric path , @xmath37\\rangle } = \\int_{c[{\\cal o}]}\\rho(m_\\alpha ) .",
    "\\label{formula2}\\ ] ] the final formula ( [ ocu13 ] ) is @xmath38,c[{\\cal o}]\\rangle } = \\int_{c[{\\cal o}]}q_\\alpha . \\label{formula3}\\ ] ] we have renumbered these formulae for convenience .",
    "we first prove ( [ formula2 ] ) . by definition , @xmath39\\rangle$ ]",
    "is given by the intersection number of @xmath40 $ ] with the perfect matching @xmath41 .",
    "in general , we have many possible intersection points , but if you consider @xmath42 intersection number , only intersection points on orientifold planes contribute because other intersection points always come in pairs .",
    "we thus have @xmath37\\rangle } = ( -1)^ { ( \\textrm{number of intersection points of $ c[{\\cal o}]$ with $ m_\\alpha$ at fixed points})}.\\ ] ] the rhs is nothing but the definition of @xmath43 } \\rho(m_{\\alpha})$ ] , which proves ( [ formula2 ] ) .    now",
    "the proof of other formulae are easy .",
    "( [ formula1 ] ) is shown from ( [ formula2 ] ) as follows : @xmath44={\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\alpha$}}$-cycle } ) \\\\ & = ( -1)^{\\langle z_{\\alpha+1,\\alpha } , { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\alpha$}}\\rangle } \\quad ( \\since ( \\ref{ocu7}))\\\\ & = ( -1)^{h(z_{\\alpha+1,\\alpha})_1 } \\quad ( \\since ( \\ref{heightdef } ) ) .",
    "\\end{split}\\ ] ] ( the subscripts @xmath21 mean the first component of the vectors . )    similarly , when @xmath40 $ ] is the @xmath45-cycle , we have @xmath46,c[{\\cal o}]\\rangle }   & = ( -1)^{\\langle m[s_\\alpha],{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\alpha$}}\\rangle } \\\\ & =   ( -1)^{h(m[s_\\alpha])_1 } \\quad ( \\since ( \\ref{heightdef}))\\\\ & =   ( -1)^{{s_{\\alpha}}_1 } \\quad(\\since ( \\ref{mviab } ) \\textrm { and } ( \\ref{ocu3 } ) ) \\\\ & = \\int_{{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\alpha$ } } } q_{\\alpha } \\quad ( \\since ( \\ref{-1sq } ) )",
    ". \\end{split}\\ ] ] the case of more general @xmath40 $ ] is similar , and this proves ( [ formula3 ] ) .",
    "we here prove theorem [ divisor ] .",
    "namely , we show that in the subspace @xmath47 defined in  [ qmt.sec ] the divisor @xmath48 is given by @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the glsm field corresponding to the unique perfect matching @xmath51 for the corner @xmath52 of the toric diagram . for any perfect matching @xmath53 , which does not necessarily correspond to a corner of the toric diagram",
    ", there is a corresponding glsm field @xmath54 , and in terms of these glsm fields the solution of the f - term condition is given by@xcite @xmath55 where @xmath56 means all perfect matchings including the edge @xmath57 .",
    "the system of @xmath54 does not have superpotential and possesses @xmath58 symmetry , where @xmath59 is the number of the glsm fields . among these @xmath60 symmetries ,",
    "@xmath61 are gauged .",
    "the gauged subgroup @xmath62 is specified by the charge matrix @xmath63 , @xmath64 .",
    "the gauge transformation of @xmath54 with parameter @xmath65 are given by @xmath66 by removing unphysical degrees of freedom associated with ( complexified version of ) this gauge symmetry , we obtain the three dimensional moduli space .",
    "we denote the natural map from @xmath67 space @xmath68 to the three dimensional moduli space @xmath69 by @xmath70 : @xmath71    these gauge transformation generate shifts in the space of angular variables @xmath72 , and the toric fiber @xmath73 of the moduli space @xmath69 can be regarded as classes defined by the following identification relation : @xmath74 we also use @xmath70 for the natural homomorphism associated with this relation .",
    "then , the points in the toric diagram are related with the unit vectors in the @xmath75 space @xmath76 by @xmath77 by this relation , we can relate the symmetry in the glsm and that of the moduli space @xmath69 .",
    "the symmetry @xmath78 $ ] acting on @xmath68 induces the isometry @xmath79 $ ] of the moduli space .",
    "it is obvious that if @xmath49 the corresponding points in the moduli space is in the divisor @xmath48 because @xmath49 is a fixed point of the symmetry @xmath81 $ ] , which induce @xmath82 $ ] in the moduli space . what is slightly non - trivial is the converse of this statement .",
    "namely , we need to show that        let us choose one corner @xmath85 in the toric diagram , and assume that @xmath83 is a point inside a divisor @xmath86 .",
    "this means that @xmath67 is invariant under @xmath87 $ ] up to gauge transformation .",
    "@xmath88 one trivial solution is @xmath89 we want to show that this is only solution to ( [ ocu17 ] ) .",
    "let us assume @xmath90 .",
    "the relation ( [ ocu17 ] ) with @xmath91 requires @xmath92 because @xmath93 for all @xmath94 due to the glsm @xmath60 anomaly cancellation condition , there is at least one @xmath95 with which @xmath96 if there is only one such a @xmath97 , say @xmath98 , it satisfy @xmath99 from ( [ ocu18 ] ) and ( [ ocu20 ] ) , we have @xmath100 this relation , however , means that @xmath101 , and the two glsm fields @xmath102 and @xmath103 , and thus two perfect matchings @xmath104 and @xmath105 , correspond to the same point at a corner in the toric diagram .",
    "this contradicts our assumption .",
    "if there are more than one @xmath97 , say @xmath98 , @xmath106 , satisfying ( [ ocu19 ] ) , then from ( [ ocu17 ] ) , we have @xmath107 this means that @xmath83 shared by more than one divisors and again contradicts our assumption that @xmath83 is a point inside the divisor @xmath86 .",
    "therefore , ( [ ocu175 ] ) is the only solution to the relation ( [ ocu17 ] ) .",
    "the statement that the set of facets form one continuous region can be shown by using the fact that edge @xmath57 is always included in two and only two non - parallel zig - zag paths .",
    "this means that @xmath108-m_\\alpha[i]$ ] becomes non - zero for two @xmath52 , and they give the boundaries which divide the plane of web - diagram into two parts .        in the case ( i ) , because @xmath115 includes @xmath57 , @xmath116 passes the edge @xmath57 from black to white , while @xmath117 passes in the opposite direction , from white to black . by the definition of zig - zag paths",
    ", we see that @xmath117 crosses @xmath118 upward when @xmath118 goes left to right .",
    "( figure [ ocu.eps ] ( a ) )    this implies that the facets @xmath119 and @xmath120 are on the side of the minor angle made by two legs ( figure [ ocu.eps ] ( b ) ) , and the all facets whose perfect matchings include the edge @xmath57 are also on the same side .",
    "the same is shown for the case ( ii ) and the proposition has been proved",
