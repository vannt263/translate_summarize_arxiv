    "as a useful tool to investigate the distinctive properties of stellar aggregates , the fitting - function technique ( buzzoni 1995 ; worthey et al .",
    "1995 ) has been extensively used in population synthesis models to reproduce integrated spectroscopic indices , even in super metal - rich ( smr ) systems such as elliptical galaxies or bulges of spirals .",
    "since these relations mainly derive from a fit of the local stellar population , with @xmath1 , it is important to confidently assess their validity also at super - solar metallicity regimes .",
    "for this reason , we derived lick narrow - band indices from spectroscopic observations of a sample of 139 smr stars with @xmath2 \\geq + 0.1 $ ] , comparing with a suitable theoretical database of synthetic reference spectra .",
    "a summary of the main characteristics of the databases is given in table  1 ( see also chavez et al .",
    "1997 , and malagnini et al .",
    "2000 for further details ) .    from the observed spectra , iron fe50 , fe52 , and fe53 , as well as magnesium mgb and mg@xmath0 indices have been computed according to worthey et al .",

    "calibration to the standard system has been done by using the subset of 49 stars in common with the lick original database , and/or with buzzoni et al .",

    "the ( o  c ) index residuals obtained by comparing observations with the corresponding fitting spectra from the theoretical database have been analyzed vs.  atmosphere fiducial parameters , according to mala - gnini et al .",
    "figure  1 shows the residual distribution for mg@xmath0 and the combined iron index @xmath3 vs.  [ fe / h ] .",
    "solid dots mark the `` fair '' subsample of 73 stars with more confident fundamental parameters ( cf .",
    "malagnini et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the four points with the largest ( negative ) residuals correspond to the coolest stars in our sample ( @xmath4 ) , and reflect the partial inadequacy of the theoretical database at this temperature range . as far as the remaining sample of 135 stars is considered , however , the residual distribution for all indices is consistent with a zero - average hypothesis .",
    "quite remarkably , we also verified the lack of any negative correlation between mg and fe ( o  c ) residuals .",
    "this indicates that a non - solar partition for the [ mg / fe ] relative abundance can confidently be ruled out for our stars .",
    "analytical fitting functions , giving the fe and mg index strength vs.  stellar atmosphere parameters across the h - r diagram , have been provided by b92 , b94 , and w94 . to check self - consistency of these functions also in the smr regime we studied their index residuals with respect to our observations .",
    "figure  2 summarizes the results for mg@xmath0 and @xmath5 .",
    "the ( o  c ) distribution in both panels is consistent with a zero average residual confirming that the two sets of equations properly account for high - metallicity stars , at least in the range of the atmosphere parameters sampled by our stars .",
    "the w94 fitting function is slightly more accurate than the b92 one ( points spread for the `` fair '' sample is @xmath6  mag vs. @xmath7  mag for the latter case ) , but at cost of a more elaborated multi - branch analytical fit .",
    "a similar behaviour is found for the @xmath5 index , with @xmath8    and @xmath9    with respect to b94 and w94 , respectively .",
    "we verified that the skewed positive residuals with respect to b94 , evident from the figure , mostly come from the warmer stars in the sample ( @xmath10  k ) for which the b94 output predicts a vanishing fe52 index .",
