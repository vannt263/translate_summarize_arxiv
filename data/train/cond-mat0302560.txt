    "recent scanning  tunneling  microscopy ( stm ) experiments give a new insight into the electronic structure of the vortex cores in the high  temperature superconductors ( htsc ) , and , more generally , into the problem of the interplay between superconductivity and a magnetic field . in type ",
    "ii superconductors , the flux penetrating the vortex suppresses the superconducting order parameter locally in the core . it was shown in 1964 by caroli _ at al._@xcite that there should be bound states around the vortex core in an isotropic @xmath0wave superconductor .",
    "hess was the first who has experimentally confirmed the existence of core states or core excitations in @xmath1 superconductor@xcite .",
    "these states manifest themselves in the local density of states ( ldos ) as a large peak near the fermi surface .",
    "similar experiments carried out for htsc have shown a rich structure of the vortex states .",
    "namely , maggio  aprile _ at al .",
    "_ have found a splitting of the central peak in @xmath2@xcite .",
    "the resulting peaks are separated by about 11 mev . on the other hand",
    "the numerical solution of the bogoliubov  de gennes ( bdg ) equations for @xmath3wave superconductivity ( dsc ) indicates the absence of such a splitting.@xcite it was later explained by franz and tesanovi that there are no truly bound states in @xmath3wave superconductors and all the states are extended with continuous energy spectrum@xcite .",
    "they tried to explain this discrepancy by introducing an additional @xmath4 component of the superconducting order parameter .",
    "the resulting @xmath5 gap is nodeless and leads to an exponential decay of the core states .",
    "generally , the presence of the bound states is expected for any nodeless gap .",
    "although , @xmath6 is commonly accepted as a dominant symmetry of the order parameter an additional component , that closes the nodes in the @xmath7 directions , can be induced by the external magnetic field @xcite .",
    "however , results presented in ref .",
    "@xcite suggest that qualitative agreement with the stm experiments can be obtained also for a pure @xmath3wave superconductivity , provided that the magnetic field is strong enough .",
    "moreover , the presence of the additional component may not lead to an essential modification of ldos .",
    "the presence of the core states in bscco , unlike ybco , is not well established .",
    "small peaks at @xmath8 mev have been reported in ref .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the core states have not been observed in other stm experiments @xcite . instead , a gaplike structure has been found in the center of the vortex core .",
    "it has been identified as a pseudogap that evolves smoothly into the superconducting gap away from the vortex core . as the origin of the pseudogap is still under debate , investigation of the vortex structure",
    "can shed a new light on this problem .",
    "the pseudogap has been investigated with the help of various experimental techniques like : angle  resolved photoemission @xcite , intrinsic tunneling spectroscopy @xcite , nmr @xcite , infrared @xcite and transport @xcite measurements . aside from other approaches a @xmath3density  wave ( ddw ) state has recently been proposed to explain the pseudogap @xcite .",
    "the ddw scenario has been investigated to verify whether it actually applies to the pseudogap regime . for the details we refer to considerations concerning the transport properties @xcite , nonmagnetic @xcite and magnetic @xcite impurities as well as the phonon self ",
    "energy @xcite in the ddw phase .",
    "according to this hypothesis the pseudogap opens due to condensation of electron  hole pairs with a nonzero angular momentum ( @xmath9 ) . as a result",
    "there are staggered fluxes originating from the orbital currents , which alter from one plaquette to the neighboring one .",
    "the ddw order breaks the time reversal , rotational and translational invariance , preserving combination of arbitrary two of them .",
    "there exists a similar approach that , however , does not break the translational symmetry @xcite .",
    "as the ddw and dsc orders compete @xcite , one may expect an enhancement ( or appearance ) of the ddw gap near the vortex core , where the superconductivity is suppressed .",
    "it is possible due to the insensitivity of the ddw order to the magnetic field @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we investigate the vortex structure assuming the ddw scenario of the pseudogap .",
    "our approach explains the tunneling spectra obtained in the vicinity of the vortex core in bscco@xcite .",
    "we analyze the vortex structure in a wide range of doping level and find crucial differences between under and overdoped regimes .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that depending on the carrier concentration one may expect pure ddw , mixed ddw+dsc , and pure dsc ordering .",
    "our results suggest the possibility of an additional phase , where the ddw order occurs only inside the vortex cores . in the framework of the su(2 )",
    "slave  boson theory this possibility has been investigated by kishine _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "as the vortices are often pinned at impurities @xcite , we investigate the electronic structure also in such a case .",
    "finally , we discuss a possible coupling between the staggered currents and the antiferromagnetic order , that has recently been observed in the vicinity of vortices.@xcite",
    "our starting point is an effective hamiltonian that describes a system with coexisting ddw and dsc orders @xcite @xmath10 the kinetic part of the hamiltonian is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the nearest ",
    "neighbor hopping integral and @xmath13 is the chemical potential .",
    "@xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) creates ( annihilates ) an electron with spin @xmath16 at site @xmath17 . according to the peierls substitution",
    "@xcite the magnetic field enters the kinetic part of the hamiltonian through a phase factor @xmath18 : in the presence of magnetic field the hopping between sites @xmath17 and @xmath19 is accompanied by acquiring of an additional phase , given by @xmath20 @xmath21 is the nearest ",
    "neighbor pairing responsible for the @xmath3wave superconductivity @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the superconducting order parameter .",
    "as we do not specify the mechanism responsible for pairing , @xmath24 is assumed to be field ",
    "independent.@xcite the ddw state occurs due to @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the ddw amplitude .",
    "note , that in contradistinction to the superconducting order parameter magnetic field explicitly enters @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "the mean  field hamiltonian can be diagonalized with the help of the bogoliubov  de gennes ( bdg ) equations .",
    "namely , we introduce a set of new fermionic operators @xmath28 : @xmath29 where @xmath30 here , the single particle hamiltonian is given by @xmath31\\eta_{ij}\\left({\\mbox{{\\bf a}}}\\right ) -\\mu\\delta_{ij},\\ ] ] and both the order parameters are determined self  consistently by : @xmath32 \\tanh\\left(\\frac{e_l}{2kt}\\right ) , \\label{bdgddw } \\\\   \\delta_{ij}&=&\\frac{v_{\\rm dsc}}{2}\\sum_{l}\\left ( u_{il}v_{jl}^*+v_{il}^*u_{jl}\\right ) \\tanh\\left(\\frac{e_l}{2kt}\\right ) .",
    "\\label{bdgdsc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the presence of magnetic field the phase factor @xmath33 explicitly appears in the expression for the ddw order parameter [ eq.([bdgddw ] ) ] .",
    "it differs the bdg equations used in this paper from those obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in order to compare the numerical results with stm data we have calculated the local density of states ( ldos ) @xmath34 , \\label{ldos}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the derivative of the fermi distribution function @xmath36^{-1}$ ] .",
    "@xmath37 is proportional to the local differential tunneling conductance that could be measured in stm experiments .",
    "we have also calculated the local electron concentration @xmath38 that determines , e.g. , the effective charge of the vortex .",
    "we have carried out calculations for @xmath39 square lattice with one superconducting flux quantum piercing this area .",
    "we have taken the nearest  neighbor hopping integral as the energy unit and assumed @xmath40 , @xmath41 . in the absence of magnetic field",
    "the phase diagram of htsc can qualitatively be reproduced for such values of the interaction strengths ( we refer to ref.@xcite for the details ) .",
    "we have analyzed the vortex structure for different values of the occupation number . for small concentration of holes , @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) ,",
    "the ddw order dominates and superconductivity is completely suppressed . therefore , there is no vortex for such an occupation number and the ddw state is homogeneous . for larger doping the ddw and",
    "dsc orders coexist . for a doping",
    "slightly higher than @xmath44 both the phases coexist in the whole sample , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ cp022 ] .",
    "the presented magnitudes of the order parameter are defined by @xmath45    ddw and dsc orderings compete with each other @xcite .",
    "therefore , reduction of one of them enhances the other one .",
    "as the ddw order is hardly affected by the magnetic field it becomes strongly enhanced in the vortex core where the superconductivity is suppressed . in order to prove that this mechanism is responsible for the enhancement of the ddw order in the vortex core we have plotted @xmath46 ( see fig .",
    "[ flat ] ) .",
    "note , that this quantity is almost constant .",
    "farther increase of doping ( @xmath47 ) destroys the ddw order in a homogeneous system.@xcite however , this ordering can be restored in the vortex core . such a case is presented in fig .",
    "[ cp038 ] .",
    "the local coexistence of ddw and dsc takes place for the doping up to @xmath48 . therefore ,",
    "due to the suppression of superconductivity , magnetic field significantly enhances the doping regime where the ddw order occurs . for",
    "higher doping the ddw order is not restored in the vortex core .",
    "it originates from the fact that for sufficiently strong doping ddw does not exist even in the absence of superconductivity ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "another interesting feature , that originates from the presence of the ddw order is related to charge of the vortex . for small doping",
    "the vortex charge is negative ( i.e. , the electron concentration in the vortex core is higher than outside the vortex , see fig . [",
    "charge]a ) .",
    "as the doping increases the electron concentration in the vortex core decreases and for @xmath50 the vortex core becomes positively charged .",
    "the inversion of the vortex charge occurs when the ddw order disappears .",
    "it originates from the changes of ldos : the ddw gap opens in the center of the band and enhances the density of states below the fermi level .",
    "this inversion may also be induced by changing of temperature , provided that the dsc transition temperature is larger than those of the bare ddw state ( overdoped region ) .",
    "namely , at low temperature the ddw order is restored at the vortex core and , therefore , vortex is negatively charged ( see fig . [ charge]b ) . at sufficiently high temperature",
    "the ddw order does not occur and the vortex is positively charged ( fig .",
    "[ charge]c ) . experimental observation of this feature would certainly support the ddw scenario of the pseudogap .",
    "the first stm measurements of the vortex core in bscco did reveal neither the existence of the core states nor the zero bias conductance peak ( zbcp ) expected for the pure dsc state @xcite .",
    "the presence of the core states in bscco has later been reported in ref .",
    "the discrepancy between both the experiments remains , however , unexplained . in our approach the ddw and dsc order parameters have nodes in the same parts of the fermi surface and the bound states do not occur ( inclusion of components with other symmetries is needed )",
    "however , we show that the ddw scenario explains the qualitative features of ldos reported in ref . @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ ldos022 ] we present the ldos for different distances from the vortex center .    for such occupation number both the ddw and dsc gaps",
    "are present also away from the vortex . when approaching the vortex center the dsc gap , that exists at the fermi level , vanishes and the ddw gap becomes strongly enhanced .",
    "the ddw gap opens in the center of the band and , therefore , is responsible for the asymmetry of the ldos inside the vortex .",
    "in particular , the peak at positive bias shifts outwards when approaching the center of vortex , whereas the peak at negative bias does not move .",
    "such an asymmetry has recently been observed in bscco @xcite . for larger",
    "doping this feature is even more pronounced since there is no ddw gap away from the vortex and the fermi level is much below the center of the band .",
    "the ldos at the vortex center evolves smoothly with doping .",
    "this is depicted in fig .",
    "the lowest curve corresponds to the case when ddw and dsc orders coexist in the bulk material .",
    "the following four curves are obtained for ddw and dsc orders coexisting in the vortex , whereas the two topmost curves are obtained for a purely dsc vortex . for",
    "small doping the ddw gap does not allow for the formation of the zbcp .",
    "the ddw gap decreases with increasing doping and the zbcp gradually develops in the overdoped regime .    in the overdoped regime a similar evolution of ldos , connected with the vanishing of the ddw gap ,",
    "can also be caused by the increase of temperature .",
    "[ temp ] shows such a situation for @xmath51 .    at low temperature",
    "the ddw gap strongly suppresses the zbcp , however a remnant of this peak is visible at the fermi level . at temperature",
    "@xmath52 the ddw gap closes and zbcp becomes strongly enhanced .",
    "farther increase of temperature destroys superconductivity , zbcp disappears and the normal  state van hove singularity appears in the center of the band ( the uppermost curve , @xmath53 ) .",
    "decay of the ddw order , when moving away from the vortex core , is doping dependent . in the underdoped case",
    "the ddw order parameter decreases monotonically from the maximum in the vortex core to the value of the bulk ddw+dsc state . in the overdoped case",
    "the ddw order vanishes outside the vortex , however the decay in not monotonic but rather oscillating .",
    "there exist lines where the ddw order changes sign , what corresponds to reverted circulation of the staggered currents ( see fig . [ checkerboard ] ) .",
    "the resulting pattern posses a fourfold symmetry and has a checkerboard  like modulation .",
    "however , the amplitude decays rapidly and disappears at the distance of several lattice constants .",
    "the size of the checkerboard squares is comparable to the coherence length ( a few lattice constants ) and increases with decreasing doping .",
    "similar pattern has recently been observed in the stm imaging of slightly overdoped bscco @xcite . the staggered flux alone may be to weak to explain the antiferromagnetic order observed in the vicinity of the vortex core @xcite .",
    "however , presence of ddw order may stabilize the antiferromagnetic ordering of spins . here",
    ", two mechanisms can be taken into account : ( _ i _ ) a coupling between the staggered magnetic field and spins , ( _ ii _ ) changing of the local electron concentration towards half  filling , where the antiferromagnetism is stable ( see fig .",
    "[ charge]a ) .",
    "this tempting hypothesis should , however , be verified within a separate study ( e.g. , one can extend the approach presented in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . this problem is currently under investigation .      as a large number of vortices",
    "is pinned at impurities @xcite we have also analyzed the vortex structure and ldos in such a case .",
    "investigation of the ldos in the vicinity of a nonmagnetic impurity has recently been proposed as an experimental test of the ddw scenario @xcite .",
    "since the ddw order is strongly enhanced in the vortex core one can expect a nontrivial modification of the vortex structure . in order to account for the presence of a nonmagnetic impurity we have extended the hamiltonian [ eq .",
    "( [ hkin ] ) ] by @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the strength of the impurity located at @xmath56 . due to the presence of the impurity the single particle hamiltonian in the bdg equations acquires an additional term @xmath57    fig .",
    "[ im1 ] shows the ddw order parameter around the vortex that is pinned at a weak impurity with @xmath58 .",
    "the dsc order parameter is absent in the vortex core and , therefore , weakly affected by the impurity .",
    "contrary to this , the ddw order is is completely suppressed at the impurity site , provided that @xmath55 is large enough .",
    "then , the ddw currents are absent on the bonds , which link the impurity site with its nearest neighbors . as a result",
    "the ddw order is suppressed also at the neighboring sites and has a maximum on a ring surrounding the vortex center .",
    "the spatial structure of the pinned vortex is reflected in the ldos , ( see fig .",
    "[ im2 ] ) . at the impurity site",
    "the most of the spectral weight is transfered to larger energies . at the nearest neighbor site",
    "the ddw order is still suppressed by impurity , whereas dsc gap is negligible as we are in the vortex core .",
    "this allows for the formation of the zbcp , as can be inferred from the second curve in fig .",
    "[ im2 ] . with increasing distance from the impurity",
    "both the order parameters develop and the zbcp disappears . here",
    ", one can observe the asymmetric gap , as discussed before for a clean superconductor .",
    "then , the ddw order parameter decays and the pure dsc order parameter achieves its bulk value ( the uppermost curve in fig . [ im2 ] ) .",
    "the above results show important qualitative differences between the structure of vortices uninfluenced and influenced by impurities . assuming the ddw origin of the pseudogap",
    ", the zbcp should occur only in the latter case .",
    "therefore , experimental verification of the ddw scenario requires the ability to independently map the vortex and impurity locations .",
    "such an experimental technique has recently been described in ref .",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated the the vortex structure in the system with coexisting dsc and ddw correlations . changing the carrier concentration we have found four phases : ( _ i _ ) pure ddw phase , ( _ ii _ ) ddw and dsc orders coexisting in the whole system , ( _ iii _ ) dsc order existing in the bulk and ddw order only in the vortex core , and ( _ iv _ ) pure superconducting vortex .",
    "the system goes from the phase ( _ i _ ) to ( _ iv _ ) when the doping increases .",
    "the actual positions of the phase boundaries are model  dependent , and may change when the electron correlations are taken into account . in the case",
    "( _ ii _ ) the ddw order parameter is strongly enhanced in the vicinity of the vortex core .",
    "it is due to the competition between dsc and ddw orderings .",
    "the presence of the ddw gap in the vortex [ phases ( _ ii _ ) and ( _ iii _ ) ] does not allow for the formation of zbcp .",
    "in this case , the evolution of the dsc gap into ddw one , when approaching the vortex center , provides a natural explanation of the gap asymmetry reported in ref . @xcite .",
    "this asymmetry originates from the fact that the ddw and dsc gaps open at different energies .    as the ddw order suppresses the zbcp",
    ", this peak can be observed in the phase ( _ iv _ ) , where the system is purely superconducting .",
    "however , one can expect the occurrence of the zbcp when the vortex is pinned at impurity .",
    "this is due to the absence of the staggered currents in the close neighborhood of the impurity .    as ddw and dsc gapes have nodes in the same directions ,",
    "the core bound states do not occur in our approach .",
    "however , an additional component of the order parameter , for which the gap is nodeless , may lead to the splitting of the zero  bias peak in ldos .",
    "the presented modification of the vortex structure originates predominantly from the competition between dsc and ddw orders .",
    "a direct coupling of the ddw order to the magnetic field is of minor importance .",
    "therefore , one can argue that the presented results remain valid also for other non  superconducting order parameter , that competes with dsc and is weakly affected by the magnetic field .",
