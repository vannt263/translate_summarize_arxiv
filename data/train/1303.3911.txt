    "the computation of the first 100200 formal powers proved to be a completely feasible task , and even for @xmath242 being as large as several millions the computation time of the whole set of formal powers is within seconds . in the presented numerical results we specify two parameters :",
    "@xmath247 is the degree of the polynomial @xmath240 in , i.e. , the number of the calculated formal powers is @xmath248 , and @xmath242 is the number of points taken on the considered segment for the calculation of integrals .",
    "let us stress that the formal powers do not depend on the spectral parameter and once calculated can be used for computing the solution and/or the characteristic function @xmath19 for thousands of different values of the spectral parameter @xmath8 without any additional significant computation cost .    there exist several computer codes for the solution of singular sturm - liouville problems .",
    "we compare our results with the results produced by sleign2 @xcite and matslise @xcite .",
    "both packages can reliably solve a variety of spectral problems for regular and singular sturm - liouville problems and are considered as basic comparison tools , the second package to our best knowledge is one of the most accurate . both packages work with double precision machine arithmetics and were used with the parameters for the highest possible accuracy goals .",
    "it should be mentioned that the applicability of both packages is restricted to the self - adjoint situation and they do not permit neither complex coefficients nor a first order differential operator at a spectral parameter .",
    "thus , to illustrate the performance of the proposed method in a situation when a comparison to the existing software is impossible , in example [ ex6 ] we consider a problem for which an exact characteristic equation can be written down and compare the obtained numerical results to those calculated from the exact equation .",
