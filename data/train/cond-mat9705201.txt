    "the bilayer heisenberg antiferromagnet , @xmath4 where the intralayer couplings run over nearest neighbors on square lattices and the @xmath5 are @xmath3 quantum spins , has turned out to be an excellent testing ground for notions of quantum criticality .",
    "a variety of controlled calculations , such as strong - coupling expansions at zero temperature ( starting with the work of hida@xcite and extended by two of the present authors@xcite ) , finite - temperature quantum monte carlo calculations@xcite and high - temperature expansions@xcite fit extremely well into the general field - theoretic framework for zero - temperature order - disorder critical points in unfrustrated two - dimensional quantum antiferromagnets.@xcite    the critical point in the @xmath3 bilayer heisenberg model is between a nel ordered phase when @xmath6 is sufficiently large ( greater than the critical value @xmath7 ) and a magnetically disordered `` dimer '' phase which is the adiabatic continuation of the @xmath8 ground state ( which is a product of interlayer singlet pair wavefunctions ) .",
    "the universality class of the phase transition is the same as for finite - temperature transitions in @xmath9 , @xmath10 symmetric models .",
    "it seemed most natural to us that for larger values of the quantum spin @xmath0 the same scenario would play out : the value of @xmath11 would change , but qualitatively nothing would be different .",
    "it therefore came as a surprise when ng , zhang , and ma@xcite described the results of schwinger boson mean - field ( sbmf ) calculations , which indicate that for @xmath12 the transition between magnetically ordered and disordered phases is _ first - order_. the calculation leads to @xmath13 , and hence indicates that for all physical values of @xmath0 the transition should be first - order ; but it is reasonable to accept the suggestion of ng _ et al .  _",
    "that sbmf theory leads to phase diagram of @xmath0 versus @xmath14 which is qualitatively valid even if @xmath15 is underestimated .",
    "two more salient points regarding the sbmf results should be noted . at large @xmath0 , the value of @xmath14 at the dimer - nel phase boundary scales as @xmath16 ; and at sufficiently large @xmath0 the ground state on the dimer side of the boundary is the pure interlayer singlet pair state ( _ i.e. , _ identical to the ground state at @xmath8 ) .    here",
    "we will argue that the results of sbmf theory for phase transitions in the bilayer heisenberg model are qualitatively incorrect , even in the limit of large @xmath0 where one might expect such an approximation to be reliable .",
    "ng _ et al .",
    "_ offer an elementary argument in support of their proposed scenario , which it is informative to reconsider .",
    "they note that the ideal nel state and the interlayer singlet state become degenerate for @xmath17 ( with the interlayer singlet state energetically favored for @xmath18 ) , while linear spin - wave theory indicates that the magnetization should vanish at @xmath19 ( with nel order existing for @xmath20 ) . at large @xmath0",
    ", it is clear that @xmath21 .",
    "_ suggest that , on decreasing @xmath14 from infinity , the transition that one might suspect should take place at @xmath22 ( presumably a continuous transition from the nel to dimer phase ) is pre - empted by a first - order transition at @xmath23 .",
    "this is certainly consistent with their sbmf calculations .",
    "however , we suggest an alternative interpretation .",
    "we believe that the argument in favor of a first - order transition at @xmath23 is too simplistic : using simple trial states to represent the ground states in the respective phases is dangerous , particularly since it is a comparison of subleading ( in powers of @xmath0 ) terms in the variational energies for each phase which leads to the estimate for @xmath23 .",
    "furthermore , there is an elementary calculation which strongly suggests that the dimer phase is unstable with respect to the development of nel order for @xmath24 .",
    "consider a single dimer , subject to a staggered magnetic field which is produced self - consistently by the staggered magnetization of the system .",
    "let @xmath25 denote the staggered susceptibility of a single dimer .",
    "then , within this `` dimer mean - field approximation '' one has @xmath26 .",
    "one can calculate @xmath27 directly from second - order perturbation theory , based on explicit formulae for 3-@xmath28 symbols,@xcite to find that @xmath29 . as promised , the domain of stability of the dimer phase is @xmath30 , in agreement with the spin - wave estimate for the stability of the nel phase .",
    "it should be clear that the dimer mean - field approximation underestimates the stability of the dimer phase , just as the standard weiss theory overestimates curie temperatures .",
    "one could reasonably object to our argument , then , by suggesting that the corrections to this mean - field theory could be large : in particular , @xmath31 might be pushed up to a value of order @xmath16 . in the following section ,",
    "we describe high - order perturbation expansions about @xmath8 for bilayers with @xmath32 .",
    "combined with the existing results for @xmath3 , they strongly suggest that the corrections to dimer mean - field theory are order unity rather than order @xmath0 .",
    "in addition , for @xmath2 bilayers we present a wide variety of results based on expansions about @xmath8 and about ising models .",
    "they are all qualitatively similar to what is found for @xmath3 bilayers , providing additional confirmation that the phase diagram is unchanged with increasing @xmath0 ( in particular , there is no evidence for any phase besides dimer or nel ) and offering accurate results which could prove useful in interpreting data from experimental realizations of @xmath2 bilayers .",
    "perturbation expansions@xcite for the ground - state energy @xmath33 , the triplet excitation spectrum , and the antiferromagnetic susceptibility @xmath34 have been carried out for bilayers with all integer and half - integer values of @xmath0 from 1 to 4 .",
    "the series coefficients for integer @xmath0 bilayers for the minimum gap @xmath35 , corresponding to wave vector @xmath36 , and @xmath34 are presented in table  [ table : gaps ] . for @xmath3 bilayers such expansions",
    "have already been presented by zheng@xcite to @xmath37 .",
    "[ gapapprox ] is a set of `` scatter plots '' of estimated critical @xmath14 values versus estimated critical exponents derived from unbiased @xmath38log - pad approximants to the gap series for @xmath2 , 2 , 3 and 4 bilayers .",
    "an analogous plot for @xmath3 is presented in ref .  .",
    "in every case they have very similar character , with nearly all exponent estimates lying slightly above the anticipated value of 0.71 , and with clear correlations between critical point and exponent values .",
    "( scatter plots for the antiferromagnetic susceptibility have very similar character ; likewise for the gap and susceptibility of half - integer @xmath0 bilayers . )",
    "as @xmath0 increases the series actually become better behaved , in that the approximants derived from a fixed number of terms are more tightly clustered ( neglecting the outliers ) and estimated exponents are closer to the expected value . biasing the exponent",
    "one can obtain more precise estimates of the critical points @xmath11 , as listed in table  [ table : xc ] .",
    "the trend is clear : with increasing @xmath0 , the critical value of @xmath14 is approaching a constant multiple of the dimer mean - field value @xmath39 . if we plot @xmath40 as a function of @xmath41 ( shown in fig .",
    "[ lambda_c ] ) , we can see that the results can be remarkably well fitted by a straight line @xmath42 with an intercept at @xmath43 slightly above @xmath44 .",
    "the constants @xmath45 and @xmath46 determined by a linear least squares fit are : @xmath47    for general @xmath0 we have found empirically , based on the ground state energy @xmath33 , the minimum triplet gap @xmath35 , and the antiferromagnetic susceptibility @xmath34 series for the eight values of @xmath0 that have been explicitly calculated , that the coefficients of @xmath48 can be expressed as polynomials of order @xmath49 in the variable @xmath50 .",
    "for example , to third order @xmath51\\lambda^2 \\label{delta}\\\\ & & + [ ( 56/135)r-(116/135)r^2-(3824/1215)r^3]\\lambda^3\\ .\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] further coefficients are listed in the appendix .",
    "one can then define @xmath52 and consider the @xmath53 , @xmath54 limit .",
    "the resulting series in @xmath55 corresponds to the terms in the double - series ( in @xmath50 and @xmath14 ) of the form @xmath56 . its @xmath38log - pad approximants are as well behaved as the series for the larger values of @xmath0 shown above , with unbiased approximants clustering and exponent estimates just above the anticipated value .",
    "biasing the critical point estimates leads to a critical @xmath55 of 0.2691(7 ) ( this is consistent with the value of @xmath45 in eq .",
    "( [ r_c ] ) ) , so the ratio of the exact critical point value in the large-@xmath0 limit to that coming from the dimer mean - field theory is 1.435(4 ) .",
    "we can also try to use the double - expansions in @xmath50 and @xmath14 to analytically continue to unphysically small values of @xmath0 .",
    "an interesting feature of the general-@xmath0 double - series ( both for the @xmath35 and @xmath34 ) is that all terms of the form @xmath57 appear to have vanishing coefficients .",
    "consequently , for @xmath58 there is no phase transition to a nel - ordered state .",
    "presumably there is a critical spin @xmath15 , less than @xmath59 , at and below which the dimer state is stable for all values of @xmath14 . it has not been possible to obtain a reliable estimate of @xmath15 by constructing @xmath38log - pad approximants at fixed values of @xmath0 : for @xmath60 the approximants depend strongly on the number of terms used .",
    "however , the extrapolation from larger @xmath0 , summarized in eqs .",
    "( [ fit_lambdac ] ) and ( [ r_c ] ) , suggests that @xmath61 .",
    "although we have presented evidence above that the dimer phase is unstable for @xmath14 larger than a critical value of @xmath30 , we did not firmly establish that the structure of the phase diagram is simply dimer phase  critical point ",
    "nel phase .",
    "the fact that the unbiased exponent values are consistent with a lorentz - invariant , @xmath9 , @xmath10 universality class is certainly suggestive . for the @xmath2 bilayers we have done much more .",
    "in addition to expansions about @xmath8 we have constructed expansions about ising models , generating a set of results analogous to those presented by zheng@xcite for @xmath3 bilayers . taken together , these leave little room for doubt about the phase diagram .    because the calculations follow those presented in ref .",
    "so closely we refer the reader to sec .",
    "iii of that paper for a description of the calculation ( note that the parameter @xmath63 in that paper corresponds to @xmath64 ) .",
    "expansions were obtained to @xmath65 ( with @xmath66 denoting the ratio of transverse to longitudinal exchange strength ) for the sublattice magnetization @xmath67 , uniform transverse susceptibility @xmath68 , and triplet excitation spectrum . from these",
    "we could derive the gap to the optical branch of the spin - wave spectrum at wave vectors @xmath69 ( @xmath70 , the minimum gap ) and @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) , spin - wave velocity @xmath73 , and spin - wave stiffness @xmath74 .",
    "the expansion coefficients will not be presented here but are available from the authors on request .",
    "results of series extrapolations are shown in figs .",
    "[ optical_gap ] , [ m_chi ] , and [ c_rho ] .",
    "they demonstrate that expansions about the nel state lead to estimates of the domain of stability of the nel phase which are completely consistent with the critical point found by expanding about @xmath8 .",
    "this is nicely confirmed by fig .",
    "[ e0 ] , which displays the ground - state energy per site .",
    "the values from the dimer expansion match very smoothly on to those from the ising expansion around the critical point , whereas for a first - order transition there would be a discontinuity in slope at the transition .",
    "all of the results presented in this subsection represent the best available theoretical values for experimentally accessible properties of nel - ordered @xmath2 bilayers , which should prove useful in the interpretation of experimental data if any such systems are studied .",
    "( in real compounds single - ion anisotropy is always present to some degree .",
    "the present calculations could readily be extended to include such terms in the hamiltonian . )    finally , it is amusing to note that in the dimer phase for @xmath75 bilayers , sufficiently close to @xmath8 , there exist spin-2 elementary excitations .",
    "let us consider @xmath2 bilayers specifically .",
    "triplet spectra for various values of @xmath14 in the dimer phase are shown in fig .",
    "[ mk_triplet ] while _ quintuplet _ spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ mk_quintuplet ] .",
    "( these spectra are obtained by direct sums of the terms in the series to the maximum order available . )",
    "the latter spectra lose physical significance when the quintuplet excitations can decay into multiple triplet excitations .",
    "one might imagine this happens for arbitrarily small values of @xmath14 , since at @xmath8 the quintuplet gap is three times the triplet gap .",
    "however , the parity , with respect to interchange of layers in the bilayer system , of the quintuplet excitations is opposite to that of the triplet excitations , and symmetry forbids decay of the quintuplet excitations into an odd number of triplet excitations .",
    "hence stable spin-2 excitations lie between the 2-triplet and 4-triplet continua for sufficiently small @xmath14 .",
    "the order - disorder transition in bilayer heisenberg antiferromagnets appears to be a problem for which schwinger boson mean - field theory leads to qualitatively incorrect results even in the limit of large @xmath0 .",
    "we have shown by high order perturbation expansions about the limit of uncoupled interlayer singlets that there is strong evidence for continuous transitions between dimer and nel phases with critical values of @xmath76 scaling as @xmath77 .",
    "there seems to be no evidence in favor of the scenario described by ng _",
    "et al._,@xcite in which the transition would become first - order for sufficiently large @xmath0 . of course this does not imply that the phase diagram for bilayer heisenberg antiferromagnets is completely universal .",
    "if further - neighbor interactions or higher - order exchange interactions ( for example , terms in the hamiltonian of the form @xmath78 ) were allowed then a wide variety of new phases could be stabilized .",
    "however , for the simplest bilayer models it appears that simple arguments based on the instability of the dimer phase to nel order ( using dimer mean - field theory ) and the instability of the nel phase to a spin - disordered phase ( using linear spin - wave theory to determine where the staggered magnetization vanishes ) , which both suggest a critical point at @xmath79 , are correct .",
    "the double expansions in @xmath14 and @xmath41 for the ground - state energy per site @xmath80 , triplet minimum energy gap @xmath35 , and antiferromagnetic susceptibility @xmath34 for spin-@xmath0 bilayers are presented in full here .",
