    "recently , local toy model theories ( ltmt ) , initially proposed by hardy @xcite and spekkens @xcite , have attracted considerable attention .",
    "hardy was motivated by making a case for non - cloning being logically independent of non - locality .",
    "spekkens used his model to support the conjecture that quantum states are states of observer s incomplete knowledge ( epistemic states ) , rather than real states of affairs ( ontic states ) .",
    "following the two original articles few modified models were proposed @xcite and the general framework of those models was discussed in various works @xcite .",
    "the main endeavour of all above works was directed at advocating the epistemic view of quantum states @xcite .",
    "this article makes a case for ontic view of quantum states .",
    "we discuss an alternative local toy - model ( i.e. model that admits local hidden variable description ) , where joint states of correlated individual systems exhibit entanglement ( thereby reinforcing recent claims that entanglement is logically independent of non - locality @xcite ) .",
    "our aim is to construct a toy - model theory in which states of physical systems imitate quantum states , yet the model is not a restriction of quantum theory .",
    "one of the central features of quantum mechanics is the existence of non - commutative observables and restrictions on their simultaneous measurements ( uncertainty principle ) .",
    "our model must mimic these features .",
    "our main thesis will be that in the process constructing toy - models with those properties we face two options .",
    "first , we can avoid introducing entangled states by postulating restrictions on our knowledge of the system s state of affairs .",
    "this is the route taken by spekkens .",
    "the basic premiss here is that underlying ontic reality of a system is exhausted by a number of mutually disjoin ontic states . in order to achieve non - commutativity and no - cloning ,",
    "one is forced to introduce limits on the observer s access to this underlying ontic reality , thereby giving ( inevitable ) rise to a distinction between ontic states and epistemic states - states to which the observer had access to .",
    "the ontic reality of states is maintained here only on the level of individual systems .",
    "correlated ( joint ) states of composite systems are mixtures of ontic states and do not have an ontic status of their own .",
    "second , we allow the observer to have full access to ontic states .",
    "however , we must put additional restrictions on those states in order to mimic non - commutativity , complementarity and no - cloning .",
    "the reward is , however , the possibility to extend ontic description to joint states , which is effectively amounts to entanglement .",
    "thus , if we allow full knowledge of the system , then entanglement will be the price to pay .",
    "the latter option is a good indication that quantum states are ontic states .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section [ sec : whatisontic ] we set up the general framework for our model and introduce the concept of a domain of disjointness .",
    "section [ sec:2-level ] presents the explicit construction of the model starting with two domains of disjointness in sub - section [ sec:2domains ] followed by four domains of disjointness in sub - section [ sec:4domains ] .",
    "this is followed by discussion in section [ discussion ] .",
    "the main paradigm of the realist s approach to physical reality constitutes the view that a physical system can be in a number of real physical states . in classical physics",
    "all possible states of the system are perfectly distinguishable by appropriate tests and measurements .",
    "quantum - mechanical systems exhibit non - orthogonality and complementarity .",
    "if our aim is to construct a toy - model that mimics quantum mechanics we must follow one of the following two strategies .",
    "first strategy is based on + _ premise i : the basic premise is that underlying ontic reality of any physical system in isolation constitutes of the set of mutually exclusive ( disjoint ) states .",
    "disjointness of states implies their distinguishability .",
    "therefore , one needs to impose limitations on access to those properties , e.g. limit distinguishability by hand , introduce hidden variables , knowledge balance principle , etc . _",
    "+ despite the fact that _ premise i _ is deeply rooted in our everyday life experience and in classical physics , there is no compelling reason for why this should be taken as a fundamental starting point .",
    "the second strategy is based on the following premise which , albeit being less intuitive , is nevertheless equally valuable and legitimate .",
    "+ _ premise ii : the underlying ontic reality of any physical system constitutes of a certain set of states , @xmath0 , which exhausts all possible internal configurations ( degrees of freedom ) of that system _ when it is isolated_. the states are not necessarily disjoint .",
    "there are subsets of mutual disjointness ( domains of disjointness ) @xmath1 , each containing only mutually disjoint states .",
    "two states @xmath2 and @xmath3 are disjoint if and only if they belong to the same domain of disjointness . _",
    "+ it is reasonable to assume that for every states there must be at least one disjoin states , therefore each @xmath1 must contain at least 2 states .",
    "one could raise an immediate objection to premise ii on the basis that the assumption of disjoint ontic states as un - natural .",
    "we stress however , that despite the fact that it will be an unusual assumption to make for many physical systems , there is no inherent logical contradiction in this assumption .",
    "each @xmath1 corresponds to a test set - up ( at least one ) , @xmath4 , which allows for an observer to distinguish between the states in @xmath1 with certainty .",
    "such a measurement will not disturb the states in @xmath1 .",
    "a measurement will disturb the states when implemented on the system when it is in a state from a different @xmath1 and will yield an inconclusive result .",
    "we define as measurement update rule in this case : the state of the system after the measurement @xmath4 will be one of the states from @xmath1 with equal probability .",
    "this randomness is inherent property of the system .",
    "consider two different domains of disjointness @xmath5 and @xmath6 , where the system is in a state @xmath7 , while measurement is @xmath8 .",
    "the measurement setting @xmath8 will correspond to a set of disjoint states @xmath9 . in order to provide systematic description of the measurement process",
    "we need to provide a rule that relates @xmath10 with @xmath6 .",
    "thus , we define a map @xmath11.the action of @xmath12 is consistent with the postulate that there is no ontic reality beyond the states in @xmath13 due to closure of @xmath13 under @xmath14 .",
    "we will consider systems with equal number of states in each @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath15-level systems is a system with @xmath15 states in each domain .",
    "let us describe properties of @xmath14 on the example of @xmath16 .",
    "two - level systems correspond to the case of 2 states in each domain of disjointness .",
    "first , consider two domains of disjointness @xmath17 and @xmath18 , where we have four ontic states in total .",
    "each domain is associated with a corresponding two - outcome test , @xmath19 and @xmath8 respectively .",
    "the test @xmath19 distinguishes between the states in @xmath5 with certainty .",
    "it yields deterministic outcome @xmath20 if prior to the measurement the system was in the state @xmath21 or @xmath22 respectively .",
    "thus , the states in @xmath5 fully characterize the test set - up ( up to the choice of labels of the outcomes ) .    what happens if @xmath19 is performed when the systems is in one of the states in @xmath6 ? in this model",
    ", it yields an inconclusive result .",
    "we define an overlap between the states @xmath21 and @xmath23 , say , as the probability to obtain outcome @xmath24 when the state is @xmath23 , @xmath25 .",
    "the fact , that we can link @xmath19 with the states of @xmath6 implies that we should be able to define a mathematical relation between @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "we define it as follows .",
    "the states @xmath21 and @xmath22 can be combined in two different ways , which give @xmath23 and @xmath26 respectively and vice versa , i.e.    @xmath27    @xmath28 are maps or rules , which are analogous to coherent superpositions in quantum mechanics and they form an _ isomorphism _ between @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the role of @xmath28 is two - fold .",
    "first , they provide an ontological link between @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "second , they allow us to give a quantitative prediction of a result of a test @xmath29 performed when a system is in @xmath30 . +",
    "* properties of @xmath28 : * the two maps are rules , according to which the states are combined",
    ". nevertheless , we demand that they obey certain mathematical properties .",
    "+ _ property 1 : _",
    "@xmath28 can be only defined on states from a single @xmath1 .",
    "+ _ property 2 : coherent superpositions of a state with itself .",
    "_ @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a null - state .",
    "a null - state is not an ontic state of the system .",
    "as seen from the forth line each state has its additive inverse .",
    "additive inverse of a state is not ontologically distinct from the state and is not observable .",
    "the model would appear as more attractive without additive inverse , however additive inverse is necessary to maintain consistency between the mathematical properties of @xmath28 and permutation transformations ( which will be described late - on ) .",
    "the existence of the additive inverse is makes our model closely resembling quantum theory in terms if the mathematical structure . notice also , that @xmath33 does not obey additivity in the sense the arithmetic operation of addition does .",
    "+ _ property 3 : associativity _    @xmath34    combination of properties ( [ prop : samed ] ) and ( [ prop : ass ] ) provides closure of the set @xmath13 under @xmath28 .",
    "indeed , it yields    @xmath35    for example , @xmath36    since @xmath37 obeys associativity and distributivity properties , it will be much more convenient to change the notation from @xmath38 to @xmath39 .",
    "however , it should be stressed again that despite resembling arithmetic addition and subtraction these are not arithmetic operations .",
    "for example , consider the combination @xmath40 each of the two superposed states can be represented in turn as a superposition of states from @xmath6 , i.e. @xmath41 + _ 1 [ |0_y)-_1|1_y)]\\mapsto |0_x)+_1|1_x)\\mapsto |0_y).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    * joint states of two systems : * we will now extend our description to states of two or more systems .",
    "such a combined state must include at least 16 states , namely +     @xmath42&@xmath43&@xmath44&@xmath45 + @xmath46&@xmath46&@xmath46&@xmath46 + @xmath47&@xmath47&@xmath47&@xmath47 + @xmath48&@xmath48&@xmath48&@xmath48 + @xmath49&@xmath49&@xmath49&@xmath49 +    here these 16 states are divided into four domains of disjointness , e.g. @xmath50 and so on .",
    "we will exclude sets of the type @xmath51 from being classified as domains of disjointness .",
    "we postulate that for each two states in a single @xmath1 the local parts must be either identical or disjoint .",
    "since _ any _ two disjoint states can be superposed coherently ( postulated ) , the full set of states will include superposition of states like @xmath52 and @xmath53 , etc .",
    "we will show that no new type of maps is required to superpose joint states . consider a superposition @xmath54 .",
    "it is obvious , that only the states of the second system are being actually superimposed while the state of the first system can be factored out , i.e. @xmath55\\mapsto |0)_x|0)_y.\\ ] ] thus , the map for 2 systems is of the same type as a map for one system and exhibits _ distributivity _ property .",
    "( we will therefore drop the superscript above the map . ) in addition , by associativity ( [ associativity ] ) we obtain a consistent result @xmath56+_1",
    "\\left[|0)_x|0)_y -_1 |0)_x|1)_y\\right]\\\\ & = \\left[|0)_x|0)_y+_1 |0)_x|0)_y\\right ] + _ 1 \\left[|0)_x|1)_y -_1 |0)_x|1)_y\\right]\\\\ & = |0)_x |0)_y + _ 1\\emptyset=|0)_x |0)_y . \\end{split}\\ ] ]    we arrive now at the main issue .",
    "armed with the laws @xmath37 satisfy we consider superpositions of the states @xmath52 and @xmath53 : @xmath57+_1|1)_y [ |0)_y+_1|1)_y]\\\\ & = [ |0)_y|0)_y+_1|0)_y|1)_y]+_1[|1)_y|0)_y+_1|1)_y|1)_y]\\\\ & = [ |0)_y|0)_y+_1|1)_y|0)_y]+_1[|0)_y|1)_y+_1|1)_y|1)_y ] , \\end{split}\\ ] ]    where the second and third equalities are due to distributivity of @xmath28 , while the last equality is due to associativity . similarly , @xmath58-_1|1)_y [ |0)_y-_1|1)_y]\\\\ & = [ |0)_y|0)_y-_1|0)_y|1)_y]-_1[|1)_y|0)_y-_1|1)_y|1)_y]\\\\ & = [ |0)_y|0)_y-_1|1)_y|0)_y]-_1[|0)_y|1)_y-_1|1)_y|1)_y ] , \\end{split}\\ ] ] which yields @xmath59    similarly we can calculate other superpositions .",
    "thus , we obtain the following domain of disjointness @xmath60 for correlated states , which are obtained by applying maps @xmath28 to product states of individual systems .",
    "@xmath61 in this domain the states exhibit definite parity with respect to tests performed on the subsystems in the same  basis \" .",
    "these states are _ ontic _ states of a combined system .",
    "thus , in our model correlated states of a composite system have ontic status of their own .",
    "the second domain of disjointness for correlated states @xmath62 corresponds to definite parity with respect to the tests performed in the complementary  bases \" .",
    "@xmath63    to emphasize the point that coherent superpositions are ontic states on their own right and shorten the notation we introduce the following notation @xmath64 and @xmath65 ( for correlation and anti - correlation respectively )",
    ". the complete set of ontic states , divided into corresponding domains of disjointness is summarized in the following table .",
    "+    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     it is clear that after receiving the result of the test the second party can complete the protocol by implementing local corrections as follows @xmath66    the protocol utilized one pair of correlated states and 2 bits of classical communication .",
    "our model resembles quantum mechanics in having the number of classical bits sent larger than the amount of bits of classical information needed to specify an ontic state of @xmath67 . in this respect , our model is stronger , than the model of spekkens , where those two quantities match .",
    "+ teleportation and dense coding are often seen as the manifestation of the characteristic aspects and features of quantum theory and we succeeded in mimicking them in our model . in the future work",
    "we will explore additional phenomena and protocols .",
    "one can commit to the ontic reality of a single physical system in two different ways .",
    "first way is to attribute a set of distinct disjoint physical states to the system .",
    "if one follows this route , then in order to mimic quantum features , e.g. complementarity , non - commutativity , no - cloning and so on , it is essential to introduce a limitation on the access to those states . in other words , one must limit an observer s knowledge about the real state of affairs of the system . when constructing a toy - model one needs to introduce such a limitation  by hand \" , as it was done by spekkens with the help of _ knowledge balance principle_. in this case all transformations and coherent superpositions are defined for the states of the limited knowledge , e.g. for the epistemic states , not the ontic states .",
    "this implies a strongly classical (  ball in a box \" ) approach to ontic states , since it is necessary to rest the rules which govern the transformations of epistemic states on the ontic states of a system .",
    "now , when we are trying to extend the model to include multiple systems and introduce correlations , correlated epistemic states will correspond to probabilistic mixture of product ontic states of individual systems .",
    "this picture does not admit a _ correlated joint ontic states_.    second way is to relax the requirement from ontic states of a single system and allow them to be non - disjoint .",
    "this is the avenue taken in this article .",
    "the expectation from all ontic states being mutually disjoint is deeply rooted in our  classical \" experience , but is it not justified as a basic for an ontological commitment .",
    "in fact , but putting these classical properties in the very foundation of the toy - model theory we condone this theory to be confined to this classical restriction .",
    "thus , the epistemic picture becomes a self - fulfilling prophecy .",
    "the benefit from allowing ontic states of a single system to be disjoint are great .",
    "it allows to extend the ontic picture to correlated joint states . in the toy - model",
    "suggested in this work , correlated joint states are ontic states .",
    "such states can not be presented as mixtures of product ontic states of individual systems and therefore are non - separable or entangled , using quantum - mechanical terminology .",
    "this model might appear less appealing than models based on the epistemic approach .",
    "indeed , one of the attractive features of spekkens s model is its elegance and simplicity .",
    "it is based on very simple plain assumptions about a single system .",
    "our model does not admit such a simple  which box the ball is ?\"-",
    "interpretation and therefore is much less intuitive .",
    "however , this model demonstrates that if we attempt to maintain the ontic interpretation on the level of composite system , we have to introduce a mathematical structure which resembles quantum theory .",
    "we started with very basic assumptions , but in the process of constructing the toy - model we were forced to attribute to it mathematical properties very similar to those that govern quantum theory .",
    "one might interpret it as a weakness of the model .",
    "nevertheless , it might be also seen as its strength . in other words",
    ", if our basic premiss is that the states of individual systems are ontic , but could be disjoint , and that correlated state are ontic as well , the toy - model theory we get resembles quantum theory in term if its mathematical structure .",
    "we see it as an evidence in support of the view that quantum states are ontic states . after all , in nature complementarity , non - commutativity and no - cloning could be inherent features of the states of physical systems on the basic ( ontological ) level , not the level of access , and this possibility should not be discounted .",
