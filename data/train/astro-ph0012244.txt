    "we have obtained multiple precise velocities for more than 70 bright subdwarf b stars , using the mmt blue channel spectrograph at 1resolution from 40004930 . typically , each sdb star was observed five to seven times over a 1 to 2 year period .",
    "most stars were observed at intervals of 1 to 2 days , 1 to 2 months , 3 to 6 months , and 12 to 18 months .",
    "we were able to determine very precise velocities , 1 @xmath1 2  km  s@xmath2 in most cases , primarily by exposing to a rather high s / n of about 70 to 100 for each exposure and taking extraordinary care at every stage of the reductions , but also due to a relatively long ccd ( 3kx1k pixels ) with good cosmetics and readnoise .",
    "the data were reduced with standard iraf reduction routines and analyzed with iraf s radial velocity cross - correlation task fxcor , which uses the method of tonry & davis ( 1979 ) . our relatively high resolution and high s / n allowed us to set the fourier filter parameters to cross - correlate on only the narrowest spectral features , primarily helium and various weak metal lines , with only a small contribution from the sharp cores of the balmer lines .",
    "we initially used a set of multiply - observed , bright , narrow - lined o and b stars as radial velocity standards ( fekel & morse , as reported by stefanik & latham 1992 ) . perversely , the only good cross - correlation templates for sdb stars are the stars themselves .",
    "the observations for individual sdb s were correlated against each other , corrected to an approximate rest velocity with roughly the same zero point as the ob standards , and combined into a preliminary template .",
    "the individual spectra were cross - correlated against the combined spectrum and the process was iterated .",
    "final velocities for each sdb were obtained from correlations with an extremely high s / n super - template consisting of the sum of the ten most similar combined sdb spectra ( after iteratively readjusting the velocities of the combined spectra to ensure a consistent zero point . )",
    "a precise understanding of the velocity errors is crucial for understanding the binary properties of sdb stars .",
    "we conducted an exhaustive monte carlo error analysis , following the procedures of pryor , latham , & hazen ( 1988 ) and armandroff , olszewski , & pryor ( 1995 ) , to determine the proper scaling factors between the true velocity errors and the relative values of verr that were output by fxcor .",
    "a comparison of our estimated errors for two stars in the sample with well - determined , unique orbits , pg0941 + 280 and pg1101 + 249 ( green , in preparation ) , shows very good agreement .",
    "the standard deviations of the mmt residuals about the predicted velocity curve are 1.54 and 1.41  km  s@xmath2 , respectively , and the monte - carlo derived errors are 1.65 and 1.47 k / s .    a subset of sdb s , whose spectra show additional spectral lines from a cool companion , required further processing .",
    "they were cross - correlated against super - templates of main sequence spectral types from f6 to k5 .",
    "the best match , determined by the lowest fxcor error values , was used as a template to derive the velocity of the cool companion .",
    "the same super - template was also velocity - shifted , scaled and subtracted from each individual composite spectrum to recover the spectrum of the sdb component alone .",
    "the resulting , comparatively lower s / n sdb spectra were cross - correlated against the best - matching high s / n `` pure '' sdb super - templates described above to derive the sdb velocities .",
    "the non - composite sdb s comprise a kinematically unbiased sample that naturally divides into two groups on the basis of the observed velocity variations . the 22 sdb s in our group",
    "i show only small velocity variations , 1 @xmath1 4  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "the distribution of the statistical probabilities of finding the observed variations is far from a normal gaussian .",
    "there are too many stars with bigger velocity variations than expected from a random distribution with the known errors : 2/3 of the @xmath3 probabilities are less than 10% and 1/3 are less than 0.1% .",
    "however , it is conceivable that pulsations could be responsible for these small amplitude motions , leaving no compelling evidence either for or against binarism in the stars in this group .",
    "the 29 sdb s in group  ii have large velocity variations , with @xmath4 distributed fairly uniformly from 7 to 91  km  s@xmath2 . for stars in this group , the velocity change over a one day interval was typically a large fraction of the total observed velocity range , indicating likely periods on the order of a few hours to a few days .",
    "our group  iii consists of 21 composite spectrum sdb stars , for which we determined the velocities of each component separately .",
    "the velocity variations for both of the individual components as well as the difference between the two components were always small , less than a few km  s@xmath2 .",
    "thus , the composite spectrum sdb s appear to have relatively long periods of many months to several years .",
    "the stars in all three groups appear to be bonafide sdb stars .",
    "figure  1 shows representative examples of combined spectra for individual sdb s in each group .",
    "the group  i sdb s , in particular , must be old disk stars with little halo contamination , given their line - of - sight velocity dispersion of @xmath5 = 34.3  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "the reason for the dramatically different kinematic behavior between groups i and ii is unknown .",
    "there are no significant differences between their distributions in the log @xmath6 _ vs _ t@xmath7 plane ( figure  2 ) , as derived from balmer line profile fitting .",
    "both groups cover a surprisingly large range of helium and metal line strengths , although there is a puzzling tendency for the nearly - constant velocity group  i stars to have stronger line strengths , on average , than the short timescale velocity variables in group  ii .",
    "group  i stars might also be somewhat brighter than those in group  ii , although this is hardly a significant result ( 7% ) due to the small number of stars in both groups .",
    "we conclude that the clear division into three groups with such disparate properties indicates quite different evolutionary histories .",
    "the sdb s in groups  i and iii can not have been through a common envelope phase , whereas group  ii sdb s must all be post - common envelope systems .",
    "it is not yet clear whether any of the group  i sdb s are binaries or not . given our velocity accuracy , no more than one sdb in group  i is likely to be a face - on example of a group  ii binary .",
    "however , the small velocity variations of the group  i sdb s are similar to those of the sdb components of the majority of the group  iii binaries , leaving open the possibility that at least some of the group  i stars could be wide binaries with undetected companions ."
