    "this record @xmath15 may represent the maximum daily temperature or the daily amount of precipitation , measured at a certain meteorological station . for eliminating the periodic seasonal trends , we concentrate on the departures of the @xmath15 , @xmath19 , from their mean daily value @xmath20 for each calendar date @xmath16 , say 1st of april , which has been obtained by averaging over all years in the record .",
    "quantitatively , correlations between two @xmath21 values separated by @xmath22 days are defined by the ( auto)-correlation function @xmath23 if the @xmath21 are uncorrelated , @xmath24 is zero for @xmath22 positive .",
    "if correlations exist up to a certain number of days @xmath25 , the correlation function will be positive up to @xmath25 and vanish above @xmath25 . a direct calculation of @xmath24 is hindered by the level of noise present in the finite records , and by possible nonstationarities in the data .    to reduce the noise we do not calculate @xmath24 directly , but instead study the `` profile '' @xmath26 we can consider the profile @xmath27 as the position of a random walker on a linear chain after @xmath28 steps .",
    "the random walker starts at the origin and performs , in the @xmath16th step , a jump of length @xmath21 to the right if @xmath21 is positive , and to the left if @xmath21 is negative .",
    "the fluctuations @xmath29 of the profile , in a given time window of size @xmath1 , are related to the correlation function @xmath0 . for the relevant case ( 1 ) of long - term power - law correlations ,",
    "@xmath30 the mean - square fluctuations @xmath31 , obtained by averaging over many time windows of size @xmath1 ( see below ) asymptotically increase by a power law @xcite,@xmath32 for uncorrelated data ( as well as for correlations decaying faster than @xmath33 ) , we have @xmath34 .    for the analysis of the fluctuations , we employ a hierarchy of methods that differ in the way the fluctuations are measured and possible trends are eliminated ( for a detailed description of the methods we refer to kantelhardt et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    1 . ) in the simplest type of fluctuation analysis ( fa ) ( where trends are not going to be eliminated ) , we determine the difference of the profile at both ends of each window .",
    "the square of this difference represents the square of the fluctuations in each window .    2 . ) in the _ first - order _ detrended fluctuation analysis ( dfa1 ) , we determine in each window the best linear fit of the profile .",
    "the variance of the profile from this straight line represents the square of the fluctuations in each window .    3 .",
    ") in general , in the @xmath22th order dfa ( dfan ) we determine in each window the best @xmath22th order polynomial fit of the profile .",
    "the variance of the profile from these best @xmath22th - order polynomials represents the square of the fluctuations in each window .    by definition",
    ", fa does not eliminate trends similar to the hurst method and the conventional power spectral methods @xcite .",
    "in contrast , dfan eliminates trends of order @xmath22 in the profile and @xmath35 in the original time series .",
    "thus , from the comparison of fluctuation functions @xmath36 obtained from different methods , one can learn about long - term correlations and types of trends , which can not be achieved by the conventional techniques .",
    "figure 1 shows the results of the fa and dfa analysis of the maximum daily temperatures @xmath15 of the following weather stations ( the length of the records is written within the parentheses ) : ( a ) cheyenne ( usa , 123 y ) , ( b ) edinburgh ( uk , 102 y ) ,",
    "( c ) campbell island ( new zealand , 57 y ) , and ( d ) sonnblick ( austria , 108 y ) .",
    "the results are typical for a large number of records that we have analyzed so far ( see eichner et al.@xcite and koscielny - bunde et al.@xcite ) .",
    "cheyenne has a continental climate , edinburgh is on a coastline , campbell island is a small island in the pacific ocean , and the weather station of sonnblick is on top of a mountain .        in the log - log plots , all curves are ( except at small @xmath1 values ) approximately straight lines .",
    "for both the stations inside the continents and along coastlines , the slope is @xmath37 .",
    "there exists a natural crossover ( above the dfa crossover ) that can be best estimated from fa and dfa1 . as can be verified easily , the crossover occurs roughly at @xmath38 , which is the order of magnitude for a typical grosswetterlage . above @xmath39",
    ", there exists long - range persistence expressed by the power - law decay of the correlation function with an exponent @xmath40 .",
    "these results are representative for the large number of records we have analyzed .",
    "they indicate that the exponent is `` universal '' , i.e. , does not depend on the location and the climatic zone of the weather station .",
    "below @xmath39 , the fluctuation functions do not show universal behavior and reflect the different climatic zones .",
    "however , there are exceptions from the universal behavior , and these occur for locations on small islands and on top of large mountains . in the first case , the exponent can be considerably larger , @xmath41 , corresponding to @xmath4 . in the second case , on top of a mountain ,",
    "the exponent can be smaller , @xmath42 , corresponding to @xmath43 .",
    "next we consider precipitation records .",
    "figure 2 shows the results of the fa and dfa analysis of the daily precipitation @xmath44 of the following weather stations ( the length of the records is written within the parentheses ) : ( a ) cheyenne ( usa , 117 y ) , ( b ) edinburgh ( uk , 102 y ) , ( c ) campbell island ( new zealand , 57 y ) , and ( d ) sonnblick ( austria , 108 y ) .",
    "the results are typical and represent a large number of records that we have analyzed so far @xcite ) .        in the log - log plots ,",
    "all curves are ( except at small @xmath1 values ) approximately straight lines at large times , with a slope close to 0.5 .",
    "if there exist long - term correlations , then they are very small .",
    "some exceptions are again stations on top of a mountain , where the exponent might be around 0.6 , but this happens only very rarely . in most cases , the exponent is between 0.5 and 0.55 , pointing to uncorrelated or weakly correlated behavior at large time spans . unlike the temperature records , the exponents actually do not depend on specific climatic or geographic conditions .",
    "figure 3 summarizes the results for exponents @xmath45 for ( a ) temperature records and ( b ) precipitation records .",
    "different climatological conditions are marked in the histograms .",
    "first we concentrate on the temperature records ( fig .",
    "one can see clearly that for stations that are neither on islands nor on summits , the average exponent is close 0.65 , with a variance of 0.03 . for the islands ( where only few records are available ) the average value of @xmath45 is 0.78 , with quite a large variance of 0.08 .",
    "the variance is large , since stations on larger islands , like wrangelija , behave more like continental stations , with an exponent close to 0.65 . for the precipitation records ( fig .",
    "3b ) , the average exponent @xmath45 is close to 0.54 , with a variance close to 0.05 , and does not depend significantly on the climatic conditions around a weather station .",
    "since for the temperature records the exponent for continental and coastline stations does not depend on the location of the meteorological station and its local environment , the power - law behavior can serve as an ideal test for climate models where regional details can not be incorporated and therefore regional phenomena like urban warming can not be accounted for .",
    "the power - law behavior seems to be a global phenomenon and therefore should also show up in the simulated data of the global climate models ( gcm ) .",
    "the state - of - the - art climate models that are used to estimate future climate are coupled atmosphere - ocean general circulation models ( aogcms ) @xcite .",
    "the models provide numerical solutions of the navier stokes equations devised for simulating meso - scale to large - scale atmospheric and oceanic dynamics .",
    "in addition to the explicitly resolved scales of motions , the models also contain parameterization schemes representing the so - called subgrid - scale processes , such as radiative transfer , turbulent mixing , boundary layer processes , cumulus convection , precipitation , and gravity wave drag .",
    "a radiative transfer scheme , for example , is necessary for simulating the role of various greenhouse gases such as co@xmath46 and the effect of aerosol particles .",
    "the differences among the models usually lie in the selection of the numerical methods employed , the choice of the spatial resolution@xmath47 , and the subgrid - scale parameters .",
    "three scenarios have been studied by the models , and the results are available , for four models , from the ipcc data distribution center @xcite .",
    "the first scenario represents a control run where the co@xmath46 content is kept fixed . in the second scenario , one considers only the effect of greenhouse gas forcing ( ghg ) .",
    "the amount of greenhouse gases is taken from the observations until 1990 and then increased at a rate of 1% per year .",
    "in the third scenario , the effect of aerosols ( mainly sulfates ) in the atmosphere is taken into account .",
    "only direct sulfate forcing is considered ; until 1990 , the sulfate concentrations are taken from historical measurements , and are increased linearly afterwards . the effect of sulfates is to mitigate and partially offset the greenhouse gas warming .",
    "although this scenario represents an important step towards comprehensive climate simulation , it introduces new uncertainties - regarding the distributions of natural and anthropogenic aerosols and , in particular , regarding indirect effects on the radiation balance through cloud - cover modification etc . @xcite .    ) , greenhouse gas forcing only ( @xmath48 ) and greenhouse gas plus aerosols ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "all curves are obtained by applying dfa3 to the monthly mean of the daily maximum temperatures generated by the four aogcms . the lines with slopes 0.65 and 0.5",
    "are shown as a guide to the eye .",
    "for details of the records , we refer to @xcite.,height=672 ]    for the test , we consider the monthly temperature records from those four aogcms . data for these three scenarios are available from the internet : csiro - mk2 ( melbourne ) , ccsr / nies ( tokyo ) , echam4/opyc3 ( hamburg ) , and cgcm1 ( victoria , canada ) .",
    "we extracted the data for six representative sites around the globe ( prague , kasan , seoul , luling [ texas ] , vancouver , and melbourne ) . for each model and each of the three scenarios , we selected the temperature records of the four grid points closest to each site , and bilinearly interpolated the data to the location of the site .",
    "figure 4 shows representative results of the fluctuation functions , calculated using dfa3 , for two sites ( kasan [ russia ] and luling [ texas ] ) for the four models and the three scenarios .",
    "as seen in figure 4 most of the dfa curves approach the slope of 0.5 .",
    "however , the control runs seem to show a somewhat better performance , i.e. , many of them have a slope close to 0.65 ( e.g. , luling ( csiro - mk2 ) ) , and the greenhouse gas only scenario show the worst performance .",
    "the actual long - term exponents @xmath45 for the three scenarios of the 4 models for the 6 cities are summarized in figure 5(a)-(c ) .",

    "obtained from the simulations of the four aogcms ( listed in ( a ) ) , for six sites ( listed in ( b ) ) .",
    "the three panels are for the three scenarios : ( a ) control run , ( b ) greenhouse gas forcing only , and ( c ) greenhouse gas plus aerosol forcing .",
    "the entries in each box represent `` model - site''.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    for the control run ( fig .",
    "5(a ) ) there is a peak at @xmath37 but more than half of the exponents are below @xmath50 . for the greenhouse gas only scenario ( fig .",
    "5(b ) ) , the histogram shows a pronounced maximum at @xmath51 .",
    "for best performance , all models should have exponents @xmath45 close to 0.65 , corresponding to a peak of height 24 in the window between 0.62 and 0.68 .",
    "actually , more than half of the exponents are close to 0.5 , while only 3 exponents are in the proper window between 0.62 and 0.68 .",
    "figure 5(c ) shows the histogram for the greenhouse gas plus aerosol scenario , where , in addition to the greenhouse gas forcing , also the effects of aerosols are taken into account . for this case",
    ", there is a pronounced maximum in the @xmath45 window between 0.56 and 0.62 ( more than half of the exponents are in this window ) , while again only 3 exponents are in the proper range between 0.62 and 0.68 .",
    "this shows that although the greenhouse gas plus aerosol scenario is also far from reproducing the scaling behavior of the real data , its overall performance is better than the performance of the greenhouse gas scenario .",
    "the best performance is observed for the control run , which points to remarkable deficiencies in the way the forcings are introduced into the models .",
    "the long - term correlations in a record @xmath52 effect strongly the statistics of the extreme values in the record , as has been shown recently in [ 2 ] .",
    "the central quantity in extreme value statistics ( evs ) is the return time @xmath53 between two events of size greater or equal to a certain threshold @xmath54 .",
    "the basic assumption in conventional evs is , that the events are uncorrelated ( at least when the time lag between them is sufficiently large ) . in this case",
    ", one can obtain the mean return time @xmath55 simply from the probability @xmath56 that an event greater or equal to @xmath54 occurs , @xmath57 .",
    "since the events are uncorrelated , also the return intervals are uncorrelated and follow the poisson - statistics ; i.e. their distribution function @xmath58 is a simple exponential , @xmath59 .",
    "+ for long - term correlations , it has been shown in [ 2 ] that the distribution function @xmath58 changes into a _ stretched _ exponential function , @xmath60 , \\eqno(4)\\ ] ] for @xmath3 between zero and one . for @xmath3 above one , in the case of short - term correlations , @xmath61 reduces to the poisson distribution .     for the record of return intervals obtained from two artificial long - term correlated records",
    "@xmath62 with @xmath63 ( upper curves ) and @xmath64 ( lower curves )",
    ". the distribution of the @xmath15 values has been chosen as gaussian , with zero mean and variance one .",
    "for the return intervals , the thresholds @xmath65 and @xmath66 have been considered .",
    "the straight lines in the figure have slopes @xmath67 , suggesting that the return intervals are long - term correlated in the same way as the @xmath15,height=288 ]    in addition , the return intervals become long - term correlated , with an exponent that is approximately identical to @xmath3 [ 2 ] .",
    "this is seen in fig .",
    "6 , where the fluctuation functions @xmath36 of the return intervals ( obtained by dfa2 ) are shown for two artificial long - term correlated records with @xmath63 and 0.7 .",
    "two values of thresholds @xmath65 and @xmath66 have been considered for each value of @xmath3 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath15 values has been chosen as gaussian , with zero mean and variance one . in the double logarithmic plot ,",
    "all the curves approach straight lines with slopes @xmath67 , suggesting that the return intervals are long - term correlated in the same way as the @xmath15 . + as a consequence , small return intervals are more likely to be followed by small intervals and large intervals are more likely to be followed by large intervals .",
    "accordingly , for long - term correlated records it is more likely than for uncorrelated records that a sequence of large return times is followed by a sequence of short return times .",
    "+ this fact may be relevant for the occurence of floods .",
    "it is well known that river flows are long - term correlated with exponents @xmath3 between 0.3 and 0.9 , in most cases close to 0.4 . in the last decades , the frequency of large floods in europe has increased .",
    "it is possible , that this increase is due to global warming , but it is also possible that it has been triggered by the long - term correlations .",

    "<S> the results indicate that the temperature variations are long - range power - law correlated above some crossover time that is of the order of 10 days . above 10 d , the persistence , characterized by the autocorrelation @xmath0 of temperature variations separated by @xmath1 days , decays as @xmath13 where , most interestingly , the exponent @xmath3 has roughly the same value @xmath14 for all continental records . for small islands the correlations are more pronounced , with @xmath3 around 0.4 . </S>",

    "<S> our results are supported by independent analysis by several groups @xcite .    </S>",
