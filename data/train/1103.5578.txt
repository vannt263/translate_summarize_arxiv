    "in the last decade , evidence for neutrino oscillations has been obtained from experiments with various neutrino sources .",
    "the parameters that characterize neutrino oscillations within a three - flavor neutrino mixing framework are the two mass squared differences @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) , the three mixing angles @xmath14 , @xmath2 , and @xmath4 , and the dirac phase @xmath3 .",
    "while the parameters @xmath14 , @xmath4 , @xmath11 and the magnitude of @xmath12 are relatively well known , the sign of @xmath12 and hence the neutrino mass hierarchy , as well as the across - generation mixing angle @xmath2 are unknown , the latter having just an upper bound @xcite .",
    "the hardest to measure will be the cp phase .",
    "many experiments are set to measure one or more of these parameters , with new upcoming super - beam experiments proposing precision measurements of various oscillation parameters although these experiments may not be sufficient to determine all the sub - leading parameters accurately , particularly for all fractions of the cp violating phase @xmath3 .",
    "neutrino factories have been proposed to provide neutrino beams from future muon storage rings where the muons decay in long straight sections , producing both muon- and electron - type neutrinos ( and anti - neutrinos ) .",
    "neutrino factories have been mooted as an excellent set up for precision measurement of neutrino oscillation parameters when the across - generation mixing angle @xmath2 is small , @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "these future facilities have the advantage of high neutrino fluxes with suppressed beam backgrounds and can provide baselines from about 1000 km for low energy neutrino factories ( lenf ) to baselines as long as the magic baseline @xmath16 km for the high energy neutrino factories ( henf ) .",
    "precision measurements of @xmath2 , leptonic cp violation , the type of neutrino mass hierarchy , i.e , the sign of @xmath12 , deviation of @xmath4 from @xmath17 ( maximal ) and if found , its octant , may be feasible only at neutrino factories .",
    "the key to this high sensitivity is the clean separation of _ wrong sign _ ( ws )",
    "events from the right sign ( rs ) ones by lepton charge identification .",
    "for instance , if the source of the neutrino beam in a muon storage ring is @xmath18 , then the beam is a ( precisely known ) mixture of @xmath19 and @xmath1 . in the absence of oscillations",
    ", we would expect to see muons ( from charged current ( cc ) interactions of @xmath19 ) at a far detector ; detection of anti - muons , or ws leptons , would then be an unambiguous signal of neutrino oscillations ( via @xmath20 , the last step occurring during interactions with the detector ) .",
    "such a ws muon ( or appearance ) signal from @xmath21 oscillations , called the _ ` golden channel ' _ , has been studied extensively as it is sensitive to all the above mentioned oscillation parameters .",
    "there are , however , correlations and degeneracies which in turn deteriorate the achievable precision .",
    "even with neutrino and anti - neutrino running , there is an eightfold ambiguity  @xcite due to the intrinsic @xmath22 degeneracy , the unknown sign of @xmath23 and the unknown octant of @xmath4 .",
    "these correlations and degeneracies can be reduced @xcite by improving the statistics or including two other appearance channels @xcite : _ ` silver ' _ ( @xmath24 ) and _ ` platinum ' _",
    "( @xmath25 ) . to date , the design of a detector capable of a large sample of cc @xmath9 or @xmath10 has been a challenge . hence in this study",
    "we assume that the neutrino factory set up has detectors with capability of muon as well as electron charge identification ; however no tau detection capability is present .",
    "detection of electrons ( positrons ) at a far detector for a @xmath18 ( @xmath26 ) beam , called appearance or wrong sign electrons , would then be an unambiguous signal of the platinum channel .    in the absence of a detector capable of identifying @xmath9 or @xmath10 ,",
    "the @xmath9 s from @xmath27 and @xmath28 oscillations will produce taus from cc interactions in the detector , which can subsequently decay to muons .",
    "these muon events will not be distinguishable from the ` direct ' muons ( i.e. , those produced from @xmath19 cc interactions ) and hence will add to the golden channel and muon disappearance events , respectively .",
    "this tau contamination in the disappearance channel has been discussed in detail in ref .",
    "the issue of the tau contribution to the golden channel muon sample was also briefly mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite , but the detailed analysis and quantitative results were presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this note",
    ", we highlight the hitherto neglected electron events from @xmath29 oscillations with leptonic decay of taus produced in cc interactions in the detector to electrons ; these add to the usual or direct ` platinum ' channel , i.e. , @xmath30 oscillations with electrons produced in cc interactions of @xmath0 s with the detector . since @xmath31",
    ", this tau contribution to ws electron ( appearance ) events will in fact be larger than the direct electron appearance events .",
    "this is in great contrast to the case of the muons where the tau contributes dominantly to the _ right sign _",
    "muon signal .",
    "it is expected therefore that this tau contribution has a stronger impact on the electron appearance channel and hence the sensitivity of this channel to the various neutrino oscillation parameters ; this additional contribution to the ws electron events in neutrino factories has not been discussed so far . in particular , we focus on how this large tau contamination to the electron events can alter the sensitivity to the mixing angle @xmath2 and the cp violating phase @xmath3 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ nm ] , we briefly describe details of the neutrino factory set up and show typical rates at typical detectors of choice . in section  [ rd ] ,",
    "we report our results for various processes and their sensitivity to the yet unknown mixing angle @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "we conclude in section  [ con ] .",
    "the reach of various neutrino factory set ups with respect to various neutrino oscillation parameters has been discussed in many papers in great detail @xcite . here we examine two cases , one a high - energy neutrino factory ( henf ) from muons at 25 gev as in ref .",
    "@xcite , and a low energy neutrino factory ( lenf ) set up with a muon source at 4.5 gev with a totally active scintillator detector ( tasd ) or a liquid argon detector ( lar ) as in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the event rates for production of leptons of flavor @xmath32 in the detector from ` direct ' and ` tau - induced ' channels are defined as @xmath33 where @xmath34 accounts for the exposure ( size of detector and years of running ) , the initial flux ( @xmath35 ) corresponds to @xmath36 type neutrinos , the differential cross - section ( @xmath37 ) is for cc interactions ( quasi - elastic , resonance and deep inelastic processes ) producing lepton @xmath32 or @xmath38 in the detector and @xmath39 are the detection efficiencies .",
    "note that the oscillation probability @xmath40 is a function of both @xmath41 of the neutrino .",
    "in addition , for the @xmath38-induced channel , we include the decay rate , @xmath42 for @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the case of interest here .",
    "the integration is over all the relevant variables , including resolution functions , corresponding to bins in the observed lepton energy and direction ( @xmath45 . for the analysis , we have added the events from both @xmath18 and @xmath26 beams . for details of computation of the kinematics , cross section , and flux",
    ", we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we merely highlight four different sets of events : @xmath46 corresponding to ws electron and muon ( appearance ) channels respectively , and @xmath47 corresponding to rs electron and muon ( disappearance ) channels respectively .",
    "when the process occurs via @xmath38 production and decay , it simply adds to one of these channels and is labelled as a ` tau - induced ' appearance or disappearance event .",
    "while the @xmath48 flux gives rise to rs electron events in the detector , the @xmath49 flux gives rise to ws events . hence , while @xmath38-induced events contribute to both the rs and ws events , they contribute dominantly to the ws contribution since the @xmath50 oscillation probability is driven by a nearly maximal mixing angle @xmath4 so that @xmath51 .    despite the kinematic suppression of the cc cross section for tau production due to the large tau mass , there is a sizeable amount of tau production rate above threshold ( @xmath52 gev ) .",
    "even with the total tau decay rate into electrons of about @xmath53 , these tau induced events are substantially larger than the direct events , particularly in the low electron energy bins .",
    "this turns out to be true not only for a henf of 25 gev , but surprisingly even for an lenf of 4.5 gev .",
    "hence , tau contamination must be taken into account while analyzing the platinum channel at any neutrino factory .    while analyzing the effects of this tau contamination we use typical oscillation parameters , @xmath54 ev@xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 ev@xmath55 ( we use the symmetric notation : @xmath59 ) .",
    "we analyze the events for sensitivity to @xmath2 and @xmath3 for a small input value of @xmath2 , @xmath60 .",
    "a threshold of 0.5 gev for electron detection is used .",
    "we use an overall normalization error of 0.1% for direct electron events . however , for the total ( direct+tau ) events , due to the larger uncertainties in the tau production cross - section , a larger 2% error is used .",
    "( note that the presence of a near detector will not help reduce the uncertainties in the cc tau production cross - section and this forms an important factor in limiting the precision measurement of neutrino oscillation parameters ) .",
    "we deal with a henf and lenf in turn .",
    "for our analysis we assume detector characteristics as specified in ref .",
    "the neutrino beam interacts with a 15 kton detector  @xcite located at a distance @xmath61 km from the source . at this baseline there is sensitivity to @xmath3 as well as @xmath2 .",
    "we assume @xmath62 useful muons per year , per polarity , and a running time of 5 years .",
    "the energy resolution of electrons is taken to be 15% and efficiency is 20% .",
    "it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : henfevents ] that the tau contribution to the electron events ( marked @xmath38 in the figure ) is substantial and can in principle alter the sensitivity to the oscillation parameters .",
    "neglect of the tau contribution will lead to measuring incorrect values of these parameters .",
    "the magnitude of the direct ( tau - induced ) events is driven by the small @xmath2 ( large @xmath4 ) ; the direct events ( marked d in the figure ) will be more appreciable for larger @xmath2 .",
    "however , the shape difference between the two contributions will remain : note that the shape of the direct events is almost flat at low energies , while the number of events quickly falls with increasing energy for the tau contribution ) resulting in rather different sensitivity of the total events ( labelled  tot \" ) to the parameters .",

    "when these are taken into account correctly , only an upper bound ( rightmost curve ) is obtained : hence this input value of @xmath2 can not be discriminated from zero . a substantial increase in exposure and detector size and characteristics is required in order to regain sensitivity to this value of @xmath2 , as can be seen from the contours in the right side of this figure . even then",
    ", sensitivity to @xmath3 is entirely lost for this choice of input parameters when the tau contribution is included ; in addition , sensitivity to @xmath2 is substantially reduced as well .",

    "we now examine whether there is any effect of the tau contamination for a low energy neutrino factory . with the tau production threshold at 3.4 gev",
    ", one would naively expect the tau contamination not to play any role in a lenf set up  @xcite .",
    "the details of the performance of a low energy neutrino factory with muon energy 4.5 gev and its excellent sensitivity to oscillation parameters such as @xmath2 and @xmath3 for @xmath67 , and to the mass hierarchy for @xmath68 , when tau events are neglected , are given in ref .",
    "we repeat these calculations , including the tau contribution , for a 4.5 gev lenf with @xmath69 useful muon decays per year , per polarity , and a running time of 10 years , with a baseline @xmath70 km .    here",
    "we consider two different detectors whose characteristics are given in ref .",
    "@xcite : a magnetized 20 kton totally active scintillator detector ( tasd ) , with electron detection efficiency 37% ( 47% ) below ( above ) 1 gev , and 10% energy resolution .",
    "we also consider a future possible 100 kton magnetized liquid argon detector ( lar ) with a substantially higher ( 80% ) electron detection efficiency and a somewhat worse energy resolution of 20% ( except for quasi - elastic events , where it is 5% ) .",
    "we also use a larger normalization error of ( 5% for direct and 5.5% for the total events ) , due to the higher systematic error expected for lar detectors .",
    "it is obvious from fig .",
    "[ fig : lenfevents ] that the tau contribution ( labelled @xmath38 ) is significant compared to the direct events ( labelled d ) even for a low energy neutrino factory .",
    "( the difference in shape of the events at tasd and lar detectors at low energy is due to the jump in the electron efficiency above @xmath71 gev for the tasd ; however , the tau - induced events are a sizeable fraction in both ) .",
    "this is a surprise , and can be understood from the fact that the @xmath9 s arise dominantly from @xmath7 oscillations and that the @xmath19 spectrum peaks near the parent muon beam energy .",
    "hence a substantial fraction of the @xmath9 s have sufficient energy , @xmath72 gev , to produce taus in the detector .",
    "these taus decay preferentially into low energy leptons @xcite .",
    "thus one needs to take into account the contribution coming from the tau neutrinos to the total ws electron events ( labelled  tot \" in the figure ) in order to obtain the correct constraint on the oscillation parameters such as @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "this situation is in contrast to the tau contribution to the muon sector , where these dominant @xmath9 s contribute to the muon disappearance ( rs ) events .",
    "the tau contribution to the golden channel ( ws events ) arise from the highly suppressed @xmath73 oscillations ; tau production is further suppressed at a lenf since the @xmath0 spectrum peaks at about only two - third of the parent muon beam energy , so that relatively fewer @xmath9 s have energies larger than the threshold energy for cc tau interaction .",
    "the corresponding 99% cl allowed contours in @xmath2@xmath3 parameter space are shown for the same input parameters , for the tasd detector , in fig .",
    "[ fig : lenftasdsens ] .",

    "again inclusion of backgrounds will further worsen the sensitivity to the various channels ; in fact , the inclusion of tau - induced events can be considered as an additional background to the main signal ; this can seriously limit the efficacy of the platinum channel , as has been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "recall that the tau - induced events add dominantly to rs muon events , in contrast to their substantial contribution to ws electron events .",

    "[ fig : lenftasdgolden ] .",
    "here we have used 73% ( 94% ) muon efficiencies below ( above ) 1 gev muon energy with 10% muon energy resolution @xcite .        due to the very different sensitivities of these two channels to the oscillation parameters ,",
    "the combined ` golden @xmath75 platinum ' channels are very sensitive to @xmath2 and @xmath3 , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : lenftasdptau ] .",

    "[ fig : lenftasdptaurs ] shows the sensitivity using the combined data from the golden and platinum channel as well as from muon disappearance ( rs muons ) .",
    "the more the number of channels , the tighter the constraints expected ; while this is true for the ` direct events ' alone , the tau - induced events continue to worsen the sensitivity to these parameters in all cases .",
    "this situation is somewhat ameliorated but still not completely compensated by the combined analysis of golden and platinum channels , or by the additional inclusion of muon disappearance events .",
    "a particularly vexing question is that of the corresponding @xmath9 cc cross - section in the detector .",
    "this will remain unconstrained even with the presence of a near detector which will measure only cc @xmath0 and @xmath19 cross - sections .",
    "as long as the normalization uncertainties associated with the tau channel remain large , the ultimate reach of neutrino factories for these oscillation parameters , particularly for @xmath2 and @xmath3 with the platinum channel , will remain limited .",

    "precision measurements of the oscillation parameters are the main goal of future advanced neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "neutrino factories have particularly good sensitivity to parameters such as the 13 mixing angle @xmath2 , the dirac cp phase @xmath3 , and the neutrino mass hierarchy , especially when @xmath2 is small and inaccessible at current or near - future reactor and short - baseline accelerator experiments .",
    "while the golden channel ( observation of wrong sign muons ) is best suited for these measurements , degeneracies and correlations worsen the sensitivities obtainable .",
    "these can be lifted by a judicious choice of baselines , improved statistics , as well as inclusion of wrong sign electron events  the so - called platinum channel  and has extensively been discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "however , muon neutrinos in such factory fluxes can oscillate to tau neutrinos , driven by the relatively large mixing angle @xmath4 , which is nearly maximal .",
    "these @xmath9 produce taus in cc interactions in a detector , which can promptly decay into muons or electrons ( each 17% of the time ) .",
