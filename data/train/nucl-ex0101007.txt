    "simple atoms such as hydrogen and helium provide effective testing ground for fundamental theories . studies of simple _ exotic atoms",
    "_ could add useful information , despite considerable challenges , both experimentally and theoretically  @xcite . in this article",
    ", we shall focus on the reactions of muonic hydrogen atoms and molecules , and their energy dependent properties revealed by a newly developed time - of - flight spectroscopy technique  @xcite , with particular emphasis on reactions related to muon catalyzed fusion phenomena .",
    "a muon is a lepton of the second generation with its mass about 207 times heavier than that of electrons , and has a finite lifetime of 2.2 @xmath0s .",
    "it is created from the decay of a pion which is obtained , typically , from intermediate energy ( @xmath1 mev ) collisions of a proton beam on a target nucleus .",
    "a negative muon can participate in a variety of atomic and molecular processes .",
    "a muonic atom is formed when a muon stops in matter replacing an electron .",
    "a muonic atom interacting with ordinary atoms or molecules can form a muonic molecule .",
    "the latter in turn can result in fusion reactions between the nuclei if the target consists of hydrogen isotopes , a phenomenon known as muon catalyzed fusion ( @xmath0cf )  @xcite .",
    "a single muon stopped in a target of deuterium - tritium mixture can catalyze more than 100 fusions , but this number is limited by two major bottle - necks .",
    "one is the rate at which a muon can go through the catalysis cycle before its decay ( cycling rate ) , and another is a poisoning process called @xmath0@xmath2 sticking in which , with a probability @xmath3 , the muon gets captured after the fusion reaction to atomic bound states of the fusion product @xmath4he , and hence lost from the cycle ( see section  [ sec : sticking ] ) .    the first bottle - neck , cycling rate is determined mainly by the rate of formation of muonic molecule @xmath5 .",
    "in fact , a straightforward mechanism for molecular formation via auger process : @xmath6^+ + e\\ ] ] is much too slow , yielding the fusion efficiency of the order of only one fusion per muon . here",
    ", dx refers to either d@xmath7 , dt or hd molecule and @xmath8 the nucleus @xmath9 , @xmath10 or @xmath11 .",
    "a resonant mechanism , however , can give much higher rates when certain conditions are satisfied .",
    "in the resonant formation : @xmath12_{\\nu k},\\ ] ] the reaction product is a hydrogen - like molecular complex @xmath13 $ ] in which @xmath14 plays a role of one of the nuclei .",
    "the process is resonant , because the energy released upon formation of @xmath5 plus the @xmath15 kinetic energy must match the ro - vibrational ( @xmath16 ) excitation energy of @xmath17 $ ] in the final state .",
    "this is only possible due to the existence of a state @xmath18 in @xmath5 which is bound very loosely ( in the muonic scale ) with the binding energy smaller than the dissociation energy of deuterium molecules .",
    "theoretical calculations  @xcite predict strong enhancement of the formation rate @xmath19 at @xmath15 energy of order 1 ev ( fig  [ fig : mut_d2 ] ) , but direct experimental information on such epithermal resonance is scarce , let alone its detailed structure .",
    "traditionally , @xmath0cf experiments in general , and molecular formation rate measurements in particular , have been performed in a bulk target made of mixture of hydrogen isotopes , in which complex chains of muon induced reactions take place , making the interpretation difficult and model - dependent .",
    "in addition , the resonant energies @xmath201 ev is difficult to access with the target thermal energy , since it would require a target of several thousand degrees , a formidable task when working with tritium .    at triumf",
    "we have developed a new target system which uses multilayer of solid hydrogen thin films  @xcite .",
    "the use of @xmath15 beam obtained from the thin film target provides some unique advantages in tackling the epithermal resonances experimentally : ( 1 ) formation process can be isolated , to large extent , from the rest of the cycle , ( 2 ) epithermal energies are directly accessible due to the available beam energy , and ( 3 ) @xmath21 time of flight across the drift distance provide information of the resonance energies .",
    "obviously , many technical challenges had to be overcome to make use of the new method .",
    "the basic processes involved in creating a beam of muonic tritium atoms  @xcite can be categorized into four step  @xcite : _ atomic formation _ ,",
    "_ acceleration _ , _ extraction _ , and _ moderation_. when a muon is stopped in a thin solid hydrogen target consisting of protium ( @xmath22h@xmath7 ) doped with a small amount ( @xmath23% ) of tritium , muonic protium atom ( @xmath24 ) is mostly formed ( _ atomic formation _ ) .",
    "the muon quickly transfers from proton to triton  @xcite to form @xmath15 , the latter more tightly bound due to the reduced mass difference . in the reaction , the @xmath15 gains about 45 ev of recoil kinetic energy , and is thus _",
    "accelerated_. the @xmath15 then slow down from the collisions with the rest of the target nuclei ( mostly protons ) , until it reaches about 10 ev . at these energies ,",
    "@xmath25 elastic scattering cross section drops dramatically due to the ramsauer - townsend effect , making the rest of the target nearly transparent ( fig  [ fig : rt_atlas ] ) .",
    "the @xmath15 atom is thus _ extracted _ from the layer into vacuum .",
    "the energy of the emitted @xmath15 , which is close to the ramsauer - townsend minimum of @xmath2010 ev  @xcite , can be controlled to some extent by placing an additional layer , for example of deuterium , on top of the emission layer ( _ moderation _ ) .",
    "creation of muonic deuterium ( @xmath26 ) is possible in a similar manner with a deuterium - doped protium target : in fact , the emission of muonic hydrogen atoms was first discovered in this system  @xcite .",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite for our measurements involving muonic deuterium .",
    "recently , we also observed emission of muonic protium atoms from pure hydrogen layer  @xcite , though emission mechanism is expected to be completely different  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : sie ] ( a ) illustrates the principle of our molecular formation measurements using the atomic beam method  @xcite . a beam of @xmath27 @xmath28/s of momentum 27 mev/@xmath29 from the triumf m20b channel was degraded in a 51 @xmath0 m gold target support , and stopped in the upstream ( us ) emission layer .",
    "the @xmath15 beam , obtained as described above , were slowed via elastic scattering in a d@xmath7 moderation layer from some 10 ev to near 1 ev to better match the resonance energies .",
    "the @xmath15 , after a few @xmath0s time of flight ( tof ) , is collided with a reaction layer in downstream ( ds ) , separated by the drift distance of 17.9 mm in vacuum .",
    "formation of @xmath5 molecules is detected by observing 3.5 mev @xmath2 particles produced in the fusion reaction , @xmath30 , which follows the formation .",
    "si detectors placed in the vacuum enables the measurement @xmath2 with high energy resolution .",
    "the background can be determined accurately by `` turning off '' the ds fusion reactions using the target without the ds layer .",
    "this ability to control a specific process , without affecting the rest , is an advantage of the thin film method .",
    "( in conventional targets , changing the target conditions would affect many processes simultaneously ) .",
    "because the time between muon stop and the fusion @xmath2 detection ( which we call _ fusion time _ ) is dominated by the @xmath15 tof , it provides a measure on molecular formation energy , as long as the energy loss of @xmath15 , due to elastic scattering before the formation in the ds d@xmath7 , is small .",
    "figure  [ fig : tofscat ] illustrates the simulated correlation between the fusion time and the energy at which molecular formation takes place , when there is little @xmath15 energy loss . a thin ds layer ( @xmath201 @xmath0 m ) was thus used in the measurement to minimize the energy loss and maximize the time - energy correlation .",
    ".estimated effects on the formation rate scaling parameter @xmath31 by the systematic uncertainties in the mc modelling .",
    "[ cols=\"<,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab1 ]    a great deal of efforts were made to understand the systematics of this new method .",
    "[ fig : thickness ] and table  [ tab1 ] give some such examples .",
    "the detail of the analysis can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . the resulting ds fusion time spectrum and its comparison with monte carlo ( mc ) simulations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mc ] , which clearly establishes the resonance structure . from the time - of - flight analysis of @xmath32",
    "ds fusion events , a formation rate consistent with @xmath33 times the theoretical prediction of faifman _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite was obtained ( the first error refers to the measurement uncertainty including the statistics and the second is that in mc modeling ) .",
    "the resonance energies were determined from the fit to be @xmath34 times the theory  @xcite .",
    "thus , for the first time , the existence of epithermal resonances in @xmath5 molecular formation was directly confirmed , and their energies measured . for the largest peak at the resonance energy of @xmath35 ev , our results correspond to the peak rate of @xmath36 s@xmath37 .",
    "this is more than an order of magnitude larger than the rates at lower energies , experimentally demonstrating the prospect for high cycling @xmath0cf in a high temperature target of several thousand degrees . if one assumes the energy levels of the [ @xmath38 molecule , which have a similar structure to those of ordinary hydrogen , our results imply sensitivity to the binding of energy of the loosely bound @xmath39 state with an accuracy comparable to the vacuum polarization and other qed corrections , opening up a new possibility of precision spectroscopy in a quantum few body system .",
    "recently @xmath0cf using a triple isotope mixture ( h / d / t ) target has drawn considerable interest  @xcite , particularly because of resonances in the @xmath5 formation in the @xmath40 collisions , predicted to be even stronger than the @xmath41 case .",
    "our thin film target allows us to create @xmath21 collision with pure hd molecules , and time - of - flight method described here should give a direct test of the theoretical prediction .",
    "the data for the @xmath40 collision have been collected , and the result will be reported in our future publication  @xcite .",
    "although our measurements of epithermal resonant formation indicates molecular formation may no longer be a bottle - neck at appropraite conditions , the process of @xmath0-@xmath2 sticking still gives a stringent limit , independent of the cycling rate , on the number of fusions catalyzed by one muon .",
    "intense efforts have been made for nearly two decades to understand this key process , but discrepancies persist between and theory and experiment ( including latest psi  @xcite and riken - ral  @xcite results ) , the experiment being systematically lower than the theory  @xcite .",
    "theoretical calculations of sticking are challenging , due to the interplay of the coulomb and strong interactions in a non - adiabatic few - body system , yet recent predictions , including the effects of nuclear structure and the deviations from the standard sudden approximation , now converge to a few percent  @xcite .",
    "they can not , however , be readily compared to experiment because most measurements are primarily sensitive to _ final sticking _ ( @xmath42 ) , which is a combination of _ initial sticking _ ( @xmath43 ) , the intrinsic branching ratio for @xmath44 , and _ stripping _ ( @xmath45 ) , collisional reactivation of the muon from @xmath46 in the target medium ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath47 ) .",
    "discrepancies in the experimental sticking results has been in part attributed  @xcite to the difficulties associated with the conventional neutron method , which include a high model dependence and the need for the absolute neutron calibration .",
    "a recent riken - ral experiment  @xcite has directly observed , with impressive statistics , x - rays from @xmath48 deexcitaion following the muon sticking to excited states of @xmath48 , taking advantage of the new intense pulsed muon beam which enabled the large signal enhancement , but unfortunately the determination of the sticking probability has to rely on the models of @xmath46 cascade and stripping , which are yet largely untested .",
    "we have proposed a new direct experiment of sticking using our multi - layer thin film target .",
    "the method is illustrated in fig  [ fig : stick ] , and the details are given in refs .",
    "the determination of sticking from the ratio @xmath49 is simple and model independent . since the stripping in the degrader is small , the measurement is sensitive to the initial sticking , while the stripping itself process can be systematically studied by varying the degrader thickness .",
    "thus experimental separation of initial sticking and stripping will become possible for the first time .",
    "currently there is growing interest in the high energy physics community world - wide in developing a muon storage ring for a neutrino factory and/or for a muon collider  @xcite .",
    "low energy muon science , including muonic atom and molecule studies would greatly benefit , if these facilities are realized .",
    "some of the experiments with solid thin films targets are presently limited by the statistics , due to small fraction of muon stops in the target layer , and increased background from muon stopping in the target support and the vacuum chamber  @xcite .",
    "we can expect substantial improvements in the accuracy , as well as entirely new types of experiments with the advent of high intensity muon sources .",
