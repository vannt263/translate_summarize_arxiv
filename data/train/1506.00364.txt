    "in many - fermion systems , the low - energy properties are often determined by single - particle excitations across the fermi surface .",
    "the character of these excitations depends on the nature of the ground state , which itself depends on the interactions .",
    "the study of single - particle excitations is therefore a key to understanding the ground state and the role of interactions . in superconductors , for instance , a gap in the single - particle excitation spectrum reveals the condensation of cooper pairs in the ground state . in a large class of materials ,",
    "the interactions bring only quantitative changes with respect to a noninteracting ground state .",
    "the single - particle excitations are then similar to uncorrelated particles , albeit with a renormalized mass and a finite lifetime .",

    "reduced dimensionality , qualitative changes may occur in the ground state , leading to the disappearance of the quasiparticles and the emergence of more complex , sometimes mysterious , excitations @xcite .",
    "the absence of quasiparticles in a fermion system is a hallmark of non - fermi liquid physics , indicating an unconventional ground state .    for electronic materials , angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes )",
    "gives access to the single - particle excitations and allows one to probe the existence of quasiparticles @xcite .",
    "the signature of quasiparticles is a peak at low energy in the spectral function , which is the momentum - energy distribution of the single - particle excitations , denoted @xmath0 .",
    "conversely , a structureless spectral function signals the absence of quasiparticles .",
    "arpes experiments require clean surfaces and ultrahigh vacuum , and an energy resolution below the typical excitation energy of the quasiparticles .",
    "steady improvements in recent years and the development of laser arpes have made it possible to measure the spectral function with excellent resolution in several condensed - matter systems @xcite .",
    "when it is present , the quasiparticle peak and its dispersion anomalies can help in identifying the interactions that determine the quasiparticle dynamics .",
    "fermionic cold - atom gases open new avenues in the study of quasiparticles , especially thanks to the possibility of tuning both the dimensionality and the strength of interactions .",
    "radio - frequency ( rf ) spectroscopy is presently the best method to measure the spectral function of cold - atom systems . unlike in conventional arpes , photoemission spectroscopy in ultracold atoms",
    "is performed using rf photons , which carry negligible momentum but only supply an energy @xmath1 .",
    "the momentum of the extracted atoms is then measured using the time - of - flight technique .",
    "if the particles are decoupled in the final state , their energy and momentum distributions follow the spectral function of the photon - induced hole , which is the occupied part of the spectral function , i.e. , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the fermi function @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of photoemission and rf experiments may be complicated by the unavoidable interaction in the final state , as well as several other difficulties . in arpes , these are , for instance , the sample surface , which breaks inversion symmetry and produces interference , or the screening of the electromagnetic field , which prevents light from entering the bulk of the material . in rf spectroscopy of cold atoms ,",
    "the main concern is the inhomogeneity of harmonically trapped gases .",
    "when interactions and excitation energies are not too low , as in the studies of the bcs - bec crossover @xcite , some of these difficulties may turn out to be irrelevant . for weak interactions , however",
    ", they will eventually become important . if the signal is broadened by final - state effects , averaging over inhomogeneities , and finite energy resolution , a precise modeling is necessary in order to recover the crucial information about the quasiparticles .    in the established theory of rf spectroscopy",

    "momentum - resolved rf experiments indeed measure the momentum distribution @xmath7 at a time @xmath8 after the extinction of the rf pulse .",
    "if atoms were excited at a constant rate , @xmath4 and @xmath6 would carry the same information , but this is not the case in practice . in this paper",

    "the derivation is performed in the finite - temperature matsubara framework .",
    "unlike @xmath4 , @xmath9 vanishes at first order in the atom - light coupling . at second order ,",
    "the momentum distribution is related to a three - point response function , whose contributions can be classified using feynman diagrams .",
