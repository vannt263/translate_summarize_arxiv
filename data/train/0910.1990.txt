    "deutsch s problem and the more general deutsch - jozsa problem were some of the first problems tackled in the field of quantum computing .",
    "they are simple , but are sufficiently non - trivial to be of interest .",
    "the generally accepted quantum solutions contain aspects of quantum parallelism , interference and entanglement , which are commonly cited as the main tools which give quantum computing its power . in this paper",
    ", we build on a previous result  @xcite that shows deutsch s original problem is solvable classically .",
    "we extend this note to the general deutsch - jozsa problem in an attempt to explore what is fundamentally important to quantum computation .      in order to be able to talk about the differences between classical and quantum algorithms , we need define them in a way which captures their differences in a constructive manner .",
    "a _ classical algorithm _ is one which is computed by a ( probabilistic ) turing machine or equivalent computational model , while a _ quantum algorithm _ is one which is computed by a uniformly generated sequence of circuits @xmath6 , where each gate @xmath7 is either a unitary gate ( chosen from a fixed set ) , or a measurement gate  @xcite .",
    "most quantum algorithms have a trivial classical counterpart via the simulation of their matrix - mechanical formulation .",
    "as long as one is careful , equivalent classical algorithms can be readily obtained by these means  @xcite .",
    "however , the dimension of hilbert space ( and thus the representation of the state ) grows exponentially with the number of qubits used in a quantum algorithm , so a classical counterpart obtained by the trivial means takes space and time that is exponentially larger than the quantum algorithm does , leaving such simulations inefficient . in this paper",
    "we examine the existence of more efficient classical counterparts to quantum algorithms that are not exponential in time or space compared to the quantum algorithm . some previous work in",
    "this has been done by jozsa and linden , who looked at conditions for simulating the matrix formulation of an algorithm efficiently  @xcite .",
    "we will look at the same issue from a slightly different angle with respect to the deutsch - jozsa problem , as well as in a more general black - box situation .    throughout this paper",
    "we will use the shorthand notion @xmath8 and @xmath9 to represent the symmetric and antisymmetric equal superpositions of the basis states , so that the hadamard gate @xmath10 has the following effect : @xmath11      the main subject of this paper , the deutsch - jozsa problem ( and also deutsch s problem ) is a form of an oracle computational problem  @xcite .",
    "this means that the input is given to us as a black - box and the goal is to determine something about this black - box .",
    "it is important that this information can only be obtained by asking the oracle allowable questions .",
    "it must not be the case that examination of the black - box structure alone allows insight into the nature of the black - box  @xcite .    in the current literature",
    "it is usually implicitly assumed that solving a problem with a classical black - box is equivalent to solving it with a quantum , or alternative kind of black - box . in general",
    ", a standard classical black - box can operate on classical bits only ( 0 or 1 ) , while a quantum black - box can operate on any state in two - dimensional hilbert space ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "this difference in some sense appears to add extra complexity and power to the quantum black - box , and it is not clear that solutions can easily be compared without taking this into account .",
    "some questions relating to this issue are developed more fully in  @xcite , and ongoing joint work with the university of york involves studying this in a physical nuclear magnetic resonance implementation to gain further insight . in this paper",
    "we will adopt the standard stance and work with the natural generalisation of the classical black - box .",
    "the original problem proposed by deutsch  @xcite is formulated as follows : consider a boolean function @xmath13 , and suppose we are given a black - box ( oracle ) to compute @xmath1 .",
    "deutsch s problem is to determine if @xmath1 is constant ( i.e. @xmath14 ) or balanced ( i.e. @xmath15 ) in as few as possible calls to the black - box computing @xmath1 .      a standard quantum solution for deutsch s problem is briefly presented , as all further analysis will stem from this .",
    "this is based on the formulation given in  @xcite which solves deutsch s problem with probability one using only one call to the quantum black - box computing @xmath1 .",
    "a traditional classical algorithm would require two calls to a classical black - box in order to determine if @xmath1 is constant or balanced .",
    "the quantum black - box extends the classical black - box to operate on superpositions of basis states .",
    "since the classical black - box is not reversible it is embedded in the unitary quantum black - box described by the unitary operator @xmath16 , an @xmath1-controlled - not ( @xmath1-cnot ) gate , such that @xmath17 in order to see how the quantum solution works , note that @xmath18 from this observation we can formulate the quantum solution .",
    "taking the initial state @xmath19 and operating on it with a 2-qubit hadamard gate @xmath20 , we get : @xmath21 next , operating on the state with @xmath16 : @xmath22 and applying @xmath20 one more time we get @xmath23 measuring the first qubit we obtain @xmath24 with probability one if @xmath1 is constant and @xmath25 with probability one if @xmath1 is balanced .",
    "this quantum solution is correct with probability one using only one call to the quantum black - box represented by @xmath16 .",
    "an important note is that this computation involves no entanglement , and the auxiliary qubit remains unchanged by @xmath16 leaving the two qubits separable .",
    "the power of this quantum solution seems to come only from parallelism and interference , not entanglement .",
    "while the quantum algorithm makes use of quantum parallelism and interference , these qualities ( unlike entanglement ) are not inherently quantum mechanical ; their physical presence in the computation may be of quantum mechanical origin , but the mathematical effect and ability to be present in classical systems is due to the two - dimensionality of qubits compared to the one - dimensionality of classical bits .",
    "hence , the same computational advantage should be achievable in a classical two - dimensional computational system .",
    "the first method , presented in  @xcite , uses complex numbers as classical two - dimensional bits .",
    "the set @xmath26 acts as a computational basis in the same way that @xmath27 does for quantum calculations , and its elements can similarly be assigned the meanings of ` 0 ' and ` 1 ' . since",
    "an arbitrary complex number may be written as @xmath28 with @xmath29 , a complex number @xmath30 is a natural superposition of the basis elements in the same way that a qubit is .",
    "just as in the quantum case , we need to embed the original classical black - box computing @xmath1 in one which operates on complex numbers .",
    "this black - box can be represented by an operator @xmath31 , a direct analogue of @xmath16 ( although the requirement of unitarity is no longer necessary ) . the effect of @xmath31 ( cf .",
    "equation  [ eqn : uf - n1 ] ) is @xmath32 if @xmath1 is constant , @xmath31 is the identity operation to within a factor of @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "if @xmath1 is balanced , @xmath31 is the conjugation operation ( @xmath35 ) . in order to project our complex numbers back on to the computational basis ,",
    "we multiply the black - box output by the input . note that this is not a physical operation but an abstract mathematical one ; in the quantum case we are forced to work in a physical computational embedding , but",
    "classically this is not the case .    if @xmath36 ( an equal superposition of basis states ) , @xmath37 in this manner , if the output is imaginary then @xmath1 is constant , if it is real then @xmath1 is balanced .",
    "importantly , this is a deterministic result , and in fact the sign of the output allows us to identify _ which _ balanced or constant function @xmath1 is .",
    "this is something the quantum algorithm provably can not do  @xcite .",
    "this process of finding a classical solution with the same complexity as the quantum solution for a problem informally corresponds to what we call de - quantisation .",
    "formally , the requirements for a classical algorithm to be a de - quantisation are different depending on the type of problem being solved .",
    "let @xmath38 be quantum algorithm with complexity measure @xmath39 and output probability distribution @xmath40 .",
    "a probabilistic turing machine @xmath41 , such that for every computable @xmath42 there effectively exists a probability distribution @xmath43 with @xmath44 , and @xmath41 sampling from @xmath43 has complexity measure @xmath45 , is a potential de - quantisation of @xmath38  @xcite . for @xmath41 to be a de - quantisation , @xmath46 must satisfy certain requirements depending on the type of problem .",
    "for example , in a standard ( non black - box ) algorithm , @xmath47 , the size of the circuit for @xmath38 , and @xmath41 is a de - quantisation if @xmath48 . in the deutsch - jozsa algorithm @xmath49 is the number of black - box calls , and @xmath41 is a de - quantisation if @xmath50 , i.e. the classical solution must also use only one black - box call . for an overview and comparison of various de - quantisation techniques",
    "we refer the reader to  @xcite , but we focus on entanglement based techniques in this paper .",
    "the de - quantisation we have presented is only one possible method , and places emphasis on mathematical correspondence with the quantum solution .",
    "a different solution is presented by arvind in  @xcite which draws physical similarities that are more visible than in the above solution .",
    "arvind uses the polarisation of a photon ( treated classically ) as the computational basis @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and any polarisation in the @xmath53-plane is physically valid .",
    "it is noted that all transformations in the group su(2 ) can be realised by two quarter - wave plates and a single half - wave plate orientated suitably , and deutsch s problem is solved using such transformations . written in matrix form",
    "the solution is mathematically identical to the quantum one .",
    "this corresponds to the following physical process : preparing a photon with @xmath54-polarisation , rotating its polarisation anti - clockwise in the @xmath53-plane by @xmath55 , applying the optical black - box and applying the anti - clockwise rotation once more before measuring the @xmath54-polarisation of the photon .",
    "the correspondence here relies not on embedding classical bits in a different , classical two - dimensional basis but on directly implementing the transformations used in the quantum solution through classical means . in other words ,",
    "the quantum algorithm does not take advantage of non - classical effects , so the same result can be obtained through purely classical optics ( regardless of whether or not photons are actually quantum mechanical objects  they do not need to be treated as such ) .",
    "this problem was extended by deutsch and jozsa  @xcite to functions on @xmath56-bit strings .",
    "the standard formulation of the deutsch - jozsa problem is as follows : let @xmath0 , and suppose we are given a black - box computing @xmath1 with the guarantee that @xmath1 is either constant ( i.e. @xmath57 , @xmath58 ) or balanced ( i.e. @xmath3 for exactly half of the possible inputs @xmath4 ) . such a function @xmath1 is called _",
    "valid_. the deutsch - jozsa problem is to determine if @xmath1 is constant or balanced in as few black - box calls as possible .",
    "an important note is that unlike in deutsch s problem , where there are exactly two balanced and two constant functions @xmath1 , the distribution of constant and balanced functions is asymmetrical in the deutsch - jozsa problem . in general , there are @xmath59 possible input strings , each with two possible outputs ( @xmath24 or @xmath25 ) .",
    "hence , for any given @xmath56 there are @xmath60 possible functions @xmath1 . of these ,",
    "exactly two are constant and @xmath61 are balanced . evidently , the probability that our @xmath1 is constant tends towards zero very quickly ( recall @xmath1 is guaranteed to be valid ) .",
    "furthermore , the probability that any randomly chosen function of the @xmath60 possible functions is valid is : @xmath62 which also tends to zero as @xmath56 increases .",
    "this is clearly not an ideal problem to work with , however this does not mean that we can not gain useful information from studying it .",
    "in this section we will provide a formulation of the solution for the deutsch - jozsa problem with @xmath63 which makes the separability of the states clearly evident and draws obvious parallelism with the @xmath64 solution presented in the previous section .",
    "for @xmath63 the quantum black - box we are given takes as input three qubits and is represented by the following unitary operator @xmath16 , just as it was for @xmath64 : @xmath65 where @xmath66 . for @xmath63",
    "there are sixteen possible boolean functions .",
    "two of these are constant , another six are balanced and the remaining eight are not valid .",
    "all these possible functions are listed in table  [ table : bfuncs ] .",
    ".all possible boolean functions @xmath67 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     evidently , half of these functions are simply the negation of another .",
    "if we let @xmath68 , we have : @xmath69 in this case the result obtains a global phase factor of @xmath33 ; this has no physical significance so the outputs of @xmath16 and @xmath70 are indistinguishable .",
    "if we initially prepare our system in the state @xmath71 , operating on this state with @xmath72 gives @xmath73 after applying the @xmath1-cnot gate @xmath16 we have @xmath74 from the well known rule ( see  @xcite ) about 2-qubit separable states , we know that this state is separable if and only if @xmath75 . by noting that the mapping @xmath76 is a bijection , we see that the separability condition reduces to @xmath77 . from table",
    "[ table : bfuncs ] it is clear this condition must hold for all balanced or constant functions @xmath1 for @xmath63 , and thus no entanglement is present in the @xmath63 case .",
    "we can now rewrite equation  [ eqn : n2fcnot ] in a separable form as follows : @xmath78    by applying a final 3-qubit hadamard gate to project this state onto the computational basis we obtain @xmath79 by measuring both the first and second qubits we can determine the nature of @xmath1 : if both qubits are measured as @xmath24 , then @xmath1 is constant , otherwise @xmath1 is balanced .      because the quantum solution contains no entanglement , the problem can be de - quantised in a similar way to the @xmath64 case , but this time using two complex numbers as the input to the black - box .",
    "we extend the black - box to operate on two complex numbers , @xmath80 , and define it by analogy to @xmath16 just as we did for the @xmath64 case .",
    "let @xmath81 , @xmath82 be complex numbers , @xmath83\\\\#2\\end{pmatrix}}.\\ ] ] 02 it is important to note that , just as in the quantum case where the output of the black - box was two qubits that can be independently measured , the output of @xmath31 is two complex numbers that can be independently manipulated , rather than the complex number resulting from their product .",
    "this is fairly intuitive because the ability to measure specific bits ( of any kind ) is fundamental to computation .",
    "note , however , that in a quantum system measurement of an entangled qubit necessarily effects the state of the other , unmeasured , qubits it is entangled to .",
    "if we let @xmath84 , multiplying by @xmath30 to project onto the computational basis as for the @xmath64 case , we get : @xmath85    by checking both of the resulting complex numbers , we can determine whether @xmath1 is balanced or constant with certainty .",
    "if both complex numbers are imaginary then @xmath1 is constant , otherwise it is balanced .",
    "in fact , just as in the @xmath64 case , the ability to determine if the output numbers are negative or positive allows us to determine the value of @xmath86 and thus which boolean function @xmath1 is .    it is because of the separability of the quantum solution that it is possible to reproduce the ability to solve the problem with only one black - box call .",
    "if the quantum state was not separable there would be no embedding of the original black - box into one operating on two complex - bits which would allow us to determine the nature of @xmath1 with only one black - box call .",
    "as with the @xmath64 case , an alternative classical approach can be presented using two photons .",
    "if a transformation on two qubits can be separated into a transformation on each qubit independently then the transformation is trivially implemented classically .",
    "as arvind noted  @xcite , the 2-qubit transformations @xmath16 can be written in such a way since they are separable : from equation  [ eqn : n2uf ] it is clear @xmath16 can be written as a product of the two 1-qubit gates operates on @xmath56 input qubits and one auxiliary qubit , @xmath9 .",
    "it has been shown ( see  @xcite ) that the auxiliary qubit is not necessary if we restrict ourselves to the subspace spanned by @xmath9 .",
    "we have presented the algorithm with the auxiliary qubit present because it is more intuitive to think of the input - dependent phase factor being an eigenvalue of the auxiliary qubit which is kicked back .",
    "the de - quantised solutions , however , bear more resemblance to this reduced version of @xmath16 operating only on @xmath56 qubits . ]",
    "@xmath87 each of these are valid unitary operators , and the transformation describing the black - box may be written @xmath88 .",
    "this means that the operation of @xmath1 can be computed by applying a 1-qubit operation ( implemented as wave - plates ) to each photon independently , and thus a classical solution for @xmath63 is easily found .",
    "the photons need not interact with each other at any point during the algorithm , not even inside the black - box implementation .    this classical , optical method is equivalent to both the quantum solution and the previously described classical solution ( although the latter is abstract and mathematical , while the former are physical ) .",
    "the difference is in how it is represented , bringing emphasis on the fact that for @xmath63 the quantum solution does not take advantage of uniquely quantum behaviour and is thus classical in nature .",
    "further , it shows that the solution can be obtained without any interaction or sharing of information between qubits .",
    "before we consider de - quantisation of the deutsch - jozsa problem for @xmath89 , we will first examine the separability of the states used in the quantum solution more carefully , as determining if a state is separable is a key step in determining if an easy de - quantisation is possible .",
    "conditions to determine if a @xmath56-qubit state is separable are presented in  @xcite .",
    "we will review these results , before reformulating them in a recursive manner which will allow us to apply these results much more easily to the deutsch - jozsa problem .    in order to determine if an arbitrary @xmath56-qubit state is separable",
    ", we must first introduce the concept of pair product invariance  @xcite .",
    "a state @xmath90 with @xmath59 is _ pair product invariant _ if and only if @xmath91 , where each @xmath92 is a constant and @xmath93 .",
    "pair product invariance can also be reformulated recursively .",
    "we let @xmath94 be the set of all pairs @xmath95 such that for any two elements @xmath96 we have @xmath97 if and only if @xmath98 is pair product invariant .",
    "we can recursively write this by breaking up the iteration over all @xmath99 . to do",
    "so we define @xmath100 as : @xmath101 recursively , this becomes : @xmath102    [ thm : ppirec ] an @xmath56-qubit state @xmath90 is pair product invariant if and only if @xmath94 , as defined by , satisfies the following condition : @xmath103 where @xmath93 and @xmath92 is constant .",
    "firstly , note that the base case , @xmath104 , simply amounts to the well - known condition that @xmath105 .",
    "we can modify the definition of pair product invariance by changing @xmath106 to range from @xmath24 to @xmath107 instead of @xmath108 since @xmath109 , thus avoiding double counting .",
    "the @xmath110 case can also be removed since it now reduces to a single term , and is hence unnecessary .",
    "the definition of @xmath100 in ensures that the quantifier @xmath111 runs for @xmath112 , @xmath113 .",
    "it is then clear to see that the required condition is satisfied by @xmath94 if and only if @xmath98 is pair product invariant .    the main theorem of relevance to us regarding pair product invariance is theorem  [ deq : thm : ppi ] below .    [ deq : thm : ppi ] if @xmath114 , a state @xmath115 is fully separable if and only if it is pair product invariant .",
    "hence , in order to determine if a state @xmath116 is separable we can simply apply theorems  [ thm : ppirec ] and  [ deq : thm : ppi ] .",
    "the recursive formulation of pair product invariance will prove more useful to develop general results on separability .",
    "note that any constant function produces a pair product invariant state , as all @xmath117 are equal and the conditions are trivially satisfied .",
    "the output of the quantum black - box for constant @xmath1 can be separated as : @xmath118      for @xmath119 we are able to find balanced functions which do not produce pair product invariant states , and thus , by theorem  [ deq : thm : ppi ] , these states are entangled .    if we choose @xmath1 such that @xmath120 then this @xmath1 is obviously balanced . for this choice of @xmath1 , @xmath121 .",
    "this implies that @xmath122 and hence the output of @xmath16 in the standard quantum algorithm is not pair product invariant and is thus entangled .",
    "the recursive formulation of pair product invariance allows us to determine exactly how many separable states exist for any given @xmath56 .",
    "theorem  [ thm : ppirec ] , along with the fact that @xmath123 , means that for a function @xmath124 to produce a separable state , the first @xmath56 qubits of the resulting state must be pair product invariant .",
    "hence we see that all functions @xmath124 which produce separable states are based on another such function @xmath125 , and hence satisfy @xmath126 , where @xmath127 denotes the concatenation of @xmath128 onto @xmath24 .",
    "this determines the action of @xmath124 on half of the possible input strings , and we must determine the possible actions on the other half .",
    "figure  [ fig : deq : ppi ] shows this nature of pair product invariance .    .",
    "]    the action of @xmath124 on the remaining @xmath59 input strings is determined by theorem  [ thm : ppirec ] .",
    "this requires that @xmath129 .",
    "since @xmath130 is already determined , @xmath131 can take on two possible values . however , once this value is chosen , all @xmath117 for @xmath132 are uniquely determined by the theorem  [ thm : ppirec ] .",
    "if we let @xmath133 be the number of functions @xmath125 which produce separable states , then @xmath124 can have @xmath133 possible configurations for acting on @xmath134 , and for each of these configurations , there are two configurations for the remaining @xmath135 input strings , hence @xmath136 . using the fact that @xmath137 we get an explicit result for the number of boolean functions @xmath125 such that @xmath138 is separable : @xmath139    we see that the number of separable states increases exponentially with the number of qubits being used .",
    "we also know that the number of possible functions @xmath125 which are either balanced or constant is @xmath140 the fraction of possible boolean functions which can be separated is @xmath141 this tends towards zero extremely quickly even for small @xmath56 .",
    "further , we can verify that for all @xmath142 there exist valid functions @xmath1 such that the output of the black - box is _ maximally _ entangled , i.e. all @xmath56 qubits are entangled together .    for all @xmath142 there exists a valid @xmath0 such that the first @xmath56 qubits of @xmath143 are all entangled .",
    "firstly we note that if any qubit is separable from the rest , a specific sub - structure is present in the state - vector . without loss of generality assume the @xmath106th qubit , @xmath144 , is separable from the rest , and let @xmath145 be the state of the other @xmath146 qubits . since all the amplitudes in @xmath98 are @xmath147 , we know @xmath148we use the state - vector notation with normalisation implicit .",
    "let us write the state vector of @xmath149 in blocks of size @xmath150 as @xmath151 .",
    "because of the symmetry in the state vector due to the tensor - product we have @xmath152 where all the signs @xmath153 are identical .",
    "the function defined by @xmath154 is clearly valid , but the corresponding state @xmath98 for this @xmath1 is @xmath155 which can easily be verified to not have the required sub - structure , and is thus maximally entangled .",
    "the result of these observations is that even if we are promised @xmath1 is valid , we can no longer be sure the output of the black - box is separable , and for @xmath89 the probability that it is separable tends to zero very quickly .",
    "since any de - quantisation would have to handle maximally entangled outputs of the black - box , this method of de - quantisation used for @xmath156 will not scale easily to higher @xmath56 , and in general yields very little information about the nature of a function .",
    "looking at this from the view of computation with classical photons , there is no classical physical equivalent of entangled photons , as this is a purely quantum mechanical effect .",
    "however , in general it is very hard to show that no de - quantisation exists for a quantum algorithm which does not introduce exponential increase in space or time . in most cases ,",
    "as earlier mentioned , a trivial method of de - quantisation is possible , but to show no better de - quantisation exists is very hard . as an example",
    ", jozsa and linden showed  @xcite that using the stabiliser description of quantum computation  @xcite it is possible to find an efficient classical simulation of a quantum algorithm containing unbounded entanglement .",
    "while de - quantisation appears to be very hard in the deutsch - jozsa problem for @xmath142 , we can investigate the general ability to de - quantise black - box algorithms . the main task in trying to de - quantise such",
    "an algorithm is to de - quantise the black - box . indeed , efficiently simulating a black - box algorithm",
    "requires finding a classical black - box embedding which does nt use an exponentially increasing amount of time or space .",
    "using the methods looked at in this paper , this step would initially require showing that both the input and output of the black - box are separable .",
    "firstly , we will summarise some important results due to jozsa and linden  @xcite , who examined the ability to efficiently simulate standard quantum algorithms by simulating the matrix mechanical formulation of these algorithms .",
    "we call a qubit register @xmath98 @xmath157-blocked if at every step of the computation no subset of more than @xmath157 qubits are entangled .",
    "their main result is theorem  [ thm : sim ] .",
    "[ thm : sim ] let @xmath38 be a quantum algorithm with the properties that only the final gate is a measurement gate , and after every unitary gate application the state @xmath98 is @xmath157-blocked , with @xmath157 independent of the input size @xmath56 . then the algorithm @xmath38 can be de - quantised using the matrix formulation .",
    "the proof relies on breaking up the @xmath158 matrices describing the gates with which the circuits in @xmath38 are composed of into matrices operating on no more than @xmath159 qubits at once .",
    "comes about rather than @xmath157 in the case where a 2-qubit gate may operate on qubits from two separate entangled blocks .",
    "this approach assumes the circuit is decomposed into 1-qubit and 2-qubit gates . ]",
    "each matrix corresponding to a gate is replaced by a single matrix no larger than @xmath160 . since @xmath157 is constant , the cost of directly simulating the quantum algorithm by matrix multiplication can be reduced to a linear overhead , exponential in @xmath157 rather than @xmath56 .",
    "this fixed - parameter tractability approach is mathematically equivalent to our approach , although our approach has the advantage that it retains more similarity to the quantum algorithms .",
    "our method can also be easier to apply and produces simpler results than blind simulation of the matrix mechanics , and also more easily extends to the setting of black - box computation .",
    "the approach used by jozsa and linden does not directly apply to black - box computation where the nature of the black - box is unknown .",
    "it could readily be adapted by having the black - box perform a set of matrix multiplications , but such an approach is less natural .",
    "we will explore applying our de - quantisation method to arbitrary separable black - box computations since it is easier to examine and work with .",
    "note that it is also not surprising that de - quantisation does not easily extend in the deutsch - jozsa problem since we have shown the entanglement grows exponentially .",
    "the simplest case to tackle for de - quantising an arbitrary black - box algorithm is the case that both the input and output of the black - box @xmath16 can be expressed in a separable form . in this case",
    "we can show how a simple de - quantisation in the spirit presented previously can easily be obtained . a nice feature which makes de - quantisation of a black - box algorithm simple",
    "is that we do not have to worry about considering the separability of the decomposition of the gate , as it is supplied as an arbitrarily complex unitary gate , not necessarily decomposed into gates from a universal basis ( indeed , we have no way of knowing how the black - box is devised ) . if we knew that the input and output of @xmath16 were separable , but had to decompose it into smaller unitary gates , we could not guarantee separability throughout the decomposed circuit representing @xmath16 .",
    "however , the unitarity of @xmath16 , regardless of its dimension , will allow a simple de - quantisation .",
    "let @xmath16 be the unitary operator representing the black - box such that @xmath16 never entangles its input in the quantum algorithm @xmath38 , i.e. both the input and output of @xmath16 are separable .",
    "then @xmath38 can be de - quantised into a classical algorithm with the same number of black - box calls .",
    "we can write the action of @xmath16 under these assumptions as @xmath161 and hence we can write @xmath162 , where each @xmath163 acts on the @xmath106th qubit only .",
    "since the quantum amplitudes can , in general , be complex - valued , we give a general construction of the classical black - box @xmath31 acting on complex - vectors rather than the complex - bits we used previously .",
    "this method amounts to simulating the matrix - mechanical formulation , much as in theorem  [ thm : sim ] .",
    "let @xmath164 then define @xmath165 a de - quantisation of @xmath38 can then simulate the matrix evolution of the quantum algorithm , but replace queries to the quantum black - box by ones to the classical black - box represented by @xmath31 operating on @xmath56 two - component vectors .",
    "thus the de - quantised algorithm will call the black - box exactly the same number of times as the quantum one .",
    "01    let @xmath16 be the unitary operator representing the black - box , and assume that for the set of input states used by the quantum algorithm @xmath38 we wish to de - quantise , both the input and output @xmath16 are separable .",
    "then the black - box can be de - quantised into an efficient classical solution .",
    "we can write the action of @xmath16 under these assumptions as @xmath166 since @xmath16 is unitary , there must exist a unitary inverse @xmath167 , which has the effect @xmath168 from we see that we each qubit undergoes the transformation @xmath169 , but we must show this transformation is unitary .",
    "let us write @xmath162 since the tensor product is distributive with respect to adjoints , we can write @xmath170 . hence , we see that @xmath171 and @xmath172 .",
    "thus the single qubit transformation is indeed unitary and we can write @xmath16 as the product of single - qubit unitary transformation above .",
    "it is then clear to see that de - quantisation of the black - box is possible .",
    "evidently , the optical method we previously employed can trivially be used since each @xmath173 and the black - box is then constructed out of wave plates .",
    "we only need to prepare the @xmath56 photons in the correct state , operate on them with the black - box and continue the rest of the algorithm with the transformed photons .",
    "equivalently , a method using two - dimensional classical bits such as complex numbers could easily be used .",
    "this shows that , as expected , a quantum black - box algorithm can be de - quantised easily into an equivalent classical algorithm if the black - box never entangles the input .",
    "note that while the de - quantised algorithm might be inefficient with respect to time , the number of black - box calls is the same as for the quantum algorithm .",
    "this black - box de - quantisation could be extended to allow bounded entanglement as in theorem  [ thm : sim ] .",
    "if entanglement is bounded throughout the whole algorithm , theorem  [ thm : sim ] will guarantee the de - quantisation is also efficient in time .",
    "these de - quantisation tools provide a useful technique of developing new classical algorithms from ones which are more naturally expressed in the quantum world .",
    "if unbounded entanglement is present , a successful de - quantisation will need to handle the problem using a different representation of the process .",
    "we have examined the ability to de - quantise the deutsch - jozsa problem for various values of @xmath56 in order to gain a better understanding of quantum algorithms and the ability for them to give exponential improvements over classical algorithms .",
    "we have extended the de - quantisation presented in  @xcite to the @xmath63 case by utilising separability of the quantum algorithm .",
    "we have shown that for @xmath174 there exist many balanced boolean functions @xmath1 for which the output of @xmath16 is entangled .",
    "the fraction of balanced functions which are separable has been shown to approach zero very rapidly .",
    "this tells us that if we were to pick a random boolean function which is constant or balanced , the probability of being able to learn information about the nature of the function through classical means in one black - box call tends to zero .",
    "the systematic method of tackling quantum algorithms and searching for classical counterparts helps us to see where quantum algorithms get their power from . trying to understand this is an extremely important step in the process of trying to devise new quantum algorithms . in order to make good quantum algorithms with ease , we need to have a much better understanding than we currently do about where their power comes from , and how to use this effectively . in our investigation",
    "we obtained conditions for which , if satisfied , indicate a black - box algorithm can be de - quantised . these kind of conditions , if explored further , are a step towards better measures of the usefulness of quantum algorithms .",
    "an area that still needs to be looked into much further is that of the black - box complexity .",
    "it is not clear the standard procedure of ignoring the differences in complexity between quantum and classical black - boxes is entirely valid . without a proper method to compare different types of black - box algorithms",
    "it is hard to convincingly claim one is better than the other , because they might not be solving quite the same problem .",
    "we see this as an important issue to investigate further .",
