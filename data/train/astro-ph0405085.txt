    "north is a giant h  ii - molecular cloud complex at a distance of 11.4 kpc @xcite .",
    "one of the earliest observations and models of w49a was made by @xcite .",
    "although they do not distinguish between w49a north and w49a south , their figures 3 and 4 indicate the emission they observed came mainly from w49a north . with resolutions of 1  to 2",
    ", they detected an h  ii region in the h76 alpha line at about 8 km  s@xmath1 and molecular clouds in the 2 cm line of formaldehyde at 4 km  s@xmath1 and 12 km  s@xmath1 with respect to the local standard of rest . because the formaldehyde observations indicated that the h  ii region is seen through the higher - velocity cloud , their picture is of an h  ii region between two molecular clouds with the one on the near side of the h  ii region moving away from us at 12 km  s@xmath1 and the one on the far side moving away at 4 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite detected what appeared to be a ring of h  ii regions seen obliquely in the radio continuum emission at 6 cm .",
    "their observations with the hat creek mm - array of the j=1@xmath00 transition of hco@xmath3 with a 7 arcsecond beam centered on the 3-mm continuum maximum showed absorption of the continuum emission on the high velocity side of the profile which they interpreted as due to collapse motion of gas toward a central mass .",
    "this was their primary argument against the earlier two - cloud interpretation of double emission peaks seen in the j=1@xmath00 lines of co ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "on the basis of observations of several transitions of cs with 12 to 20 arcsecond beams , @xcite argue that the double peaks can not be due to self - absorption because their observations of c@xmath2s show the peaks in lines that should not be saturated because the terrestrial abundance of @xmath2s is 23 times smaller than the abundance of the ordinary isotope , @xmath5s .",
    "they also argue that the emission at low velocity ( near 4 km  s@xmath1 ) and absorption at high velocity ( near 12 km  s@xmath1 ) seen towards the h  ii region g are due to separate molecular clouds , not the collapse of one cloud as welch et al .",
    "proposed , because the cs emission from the 12 km  s@xmath1 gas is seen over a large part of the field and stays at 12 km  s@xmath1 rather than dropping to , e.g. , 8 km  s@xmath1 at the edges .",
    "serabyn et al .",
    "suggest that the two clouds are colliding , and the collision has triggered enhanced o - star formation .",
    "@xcite using a multi - level , non - lte radiative transfer code found that a large - scale free - fall collapse reproduced the hco@xmath3 j=1@xmath00 inverse p - cygni profile observed with 7  resolution toward h  ii region g and the j=3@xmath02 profiles observed with 24  resolution at locations both towards and away from g.    @xcite , using a hydrodynamic simulation of gravitational fragmentation , concluded that welch et al.s `` ring of h  ii regions '' may have formed in the gravitational fragmentation of a flattened , rotating molecular cloud .",
    "in contrast to a global collapse , keto et al .",
    "say that the double - peaked emission lines and absorption lines and even the inverse p - cygni profiles are indicative of localized accretion flows in individual star - forming fragments .",
    "we undertook the present study to see if we could find a way to distinguish between these competing models : multiple static clouds , global collapse , or local collapse , using the radiative transfer code of dickel & auer and observations with the berkeley - illinois - maryland - association ( bima ) array of the cs j=2@xmath01 transition with a 5 arcsecond beam ( dickel et al .",
    "1999 , paper 1 ) together with the lower - resolution observations of serabyn et al .",
    "we used two fortran programs , rt and mc , to create model molecular clouds and to compare intensity profiles one would observe from them with observations .",
    "the multi - level , non - lte radiative transfer code , rt , which is based on an accelerated lambda iteration method is described in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "it assumes spherical symmetry in the cloud , but the variation of density , molecular abundance , velocity , and other parameters with radial distance is arbitrary .",
    "the program automatically handles regions where there is a transition to or from population inversions .",
    "the program creates files of emergent intensity and optical depth as functions of impact parameter , velocity , and transition .",
    "these files are used by the display program , mc .",
    "this program ( described more fully in the appendix ) assumes that the radiation from one cloud does not affect the populations of the energy levels in another cloud , so each cloud just attenuates the radiation from clouds behind it and adds its own contribution to the intensity .",
    "the validity of this assumption is discussed in the appendix . for each cloud",
    "the user specifies the velocity with respect to the local standard of rest , the offset on the sky from some origin , and the relative position along the line of sight .",
    "the number of clouds that can be included is limited only by the size of the memory of the computer and the patience of the user .",
    "the outputs include a graphical display for the tektronics window under x windows , a file with a postscript version of the display , a log file with information about the display and the rms difference between the model profile and the observed profile , and a file with the computed profiles .",
    "we used observations of several transitions of the cs molecule in the directions of h  ii regions a and g and in the direction of the central cloud of @xcite .",
    "the data consist of observations of the j=2@xmath01 transition of cs convolved to 5  resolution in the directions of h  ii regions a , b , and g with the berkeley - illinois - maryland - association ( bima ) array .",
    "those in the directions of a and g were also convolved to 20  to compare with the serabyn et al . observations .",
    "the intensities as a function of velocity for the cs emission from the j=3@xmath02 , 5@xmath04 , and 7@xmath06 transitions of cs observed with 20  resolution in the directions of serabyn et al.s central clump and southwestern clump were read from figure 2 of their paper .",
    "the bima observations are described more fully in paper 1 .",
    "there are a number of features that models of the complex should reproduce .",
    "serabyn et al",
    ". saw an extended region of cs emission elongated from southwest to northeast with a velocity gradient which they interpreted as three partially overlapping clumps .",
    "when convolved to the same resolution ( 12@xmath020 ) , the bima observations of the j=2@xmath01 cs line show the same features . at higher resolution",
    "( 5 ) we see inverse p - cygni profiles at g and a `` c '' shape in p@xmath0v plots through g. these features are not seen at lower resolution .",
    "we consider only the southwestern and central clumps in serabyn et al.s model .",
    "there are a number of h  ii regions in the complex .",
    "we consider h  ii regions a , b , and g which are near the southwest and center of the complex , and attempt to reproduce the observed cs profiles and line strengths in these directions . in the high resolution",
    "cs j=2@xmath01 spectra where the continuum emission has not been removed ( figure 10a of paper 1 ) , the profiles in the directions of a , b , and g have similar intensities between 10 and 20 km  s@xmath6 .",
    "we converted the observed brightness temperatures t@xmath7(k ) to intensities i ( ergs  s@xmath1  cm@xmath1 hz@xmath1 ster@xmath1 ) when displaying the observed and theoretical line profiles .",
    "the relationship between t@xmath7(k ) and i(cgs ) is given by : @xmath9 where c is the velocity of light , k is planck s constant , and @xmath10 is the frequency in hz .",
    "the values of c(@xmath10 ) are given in table 1 for the observed transitions of cs and c@xmath2s .",
    "the overall strategy was to start with each of the three models mentioned above , multiple static clouds , global collapse , and localized collapse , using the parameters suggested by their proponents .",
    "the sizes of the h  ii regions came from @xcite .",
    "the electron densities in the h  ii regions were adjusted to make the continuum levels predicted by the models fit the observed levels .",
    "the cloud densities , velocities , turbulent velocities , molecular abundances , and sizes were then adjusted to fit all the observed line profiles as well as possible .",
    "the fit was judged both by eye and by the rms differences between the model profiles and the observed profiles",
    ". then additional clouds were added as seemed indicated by the observations .",
    "finally we relaxed the assumption of uniform conditions within the clouds .",
    "this section will summarize the effects on a spectral profile of changes in the basic parameters of a model cloud with an h  ii region at its center .",
    "section 5.3.2 of @xcite describes using the observed continuum level to fix the electron density in the central h  ii region of the cloud .",
    "we followed the same procedure .",
    "for an optically thin gas which is collisionally excited , the emission should scale with the square of the volume density ( particles  @xmath11 ) .",
    "figure 4 and sections 6.1 and 6.2 of @xcite illustrate the effects of varying the volume density of molecular hydrogen and the relative abundance of hco@xmath3 for the j=0@xmath01 and 3@xmath02 transitions .",
    "the figure shows that the strength of the line increases with increasing molecular abundance for both transitions .",
    "it also shows that the higher transition is much more sensitive to the molecular hydrogen density than is the lower transition .    as is well known , motion of the molecules due to thermal motion , turbulence , and gradients in outflows or inflows broaden the lines .",
    "we combine thermal and non - thermal turbulent motion into a microturbulent velocity .",
    "the effects of gradients in inflows and outflows is discussed in section 5.3.3 of @xcite in the case where the line of sight goes through the center of a cloud that shows a p - cygni or inverse p - cygni profile in one of the transitions .",
    "their figure 3 relates conditions in the clouds to intensities in the line profiles for velocity fields representing free - fall and homologous collapse .",
    "our tests show that the behavior of lines from the cs molecule is similar to the behavior of hco@xmath3 lines .",
    "most of the cs transitions in our clouds are optically thin .",
    "however , the gas becomes optically thick in the j=5@xmath04 and j=7@xmath06 transitions for cloud a and in the gas causing the absorption in the j=2@xmath01 line  which is cloud g in the multi - cloud model , cloud b in the local collapse model , and cloud b and the envelope of cloud g in the global collapse model .",
    "the brightness temperature of the emission is the product of the excitation temperature and @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the optical depth of the transition .",
    "as the optical depth increases , the brightness temperature approaches the excitation temperature .",
    "the excitation temperature of a transition depends on the kinetic temperature , the density of colliders ( hydrogen molecules ) and the energy , @xmath14 , of the upper level .",
    "the `` equivalent temperature '' in kelvins is @xmath14/k , where k is the boltzmann constant .",
    "when the kinetic temperature is below the equivalent temperature of a level , then only a small fraction of the collisions have enough energy to populate the level , so very high densities are needed .",
    "the j=2 level of cs is easy to excite because its equivalent temperature is only 7k whereas the j=7 level with an equivalent temperature of 66k is much harder to excite .",
    "the `` critical density '' is the density for which the levels become thermalized , i.e. the excitation temperature equals the kinetic temperature @xcite . for kinetic temperatures between 50k and 100k , this occurs at h@xmath15 densities , n(h@xmath15 ) , of @xmath16  @xmath11 for the j=2@xmath01 transition and @xmath17  @xmath11 for the j=7@xmath06 transition .",
    "if the levels are subthermal and the overpopulation of the upper level is small , then any variation in the background radiation field is amplified by the same factor and is relatively small , i.e. the emergent intensity is linearly proportional to the background kinetic temperature .",
    "if the populations become strongly inverted , then there is exponential amplification and comparatively small changes in the negative optical depth will result in exponentially larger variation in the emergent intensity . in the outer parts of most of our model clouds , the cs is subthermally excited , but",
    "in the central parts , the lower cs levels are thermalized and in some cases become suprathermal .",
    "for some models , there is a small range of radii where the populations of the lowest levels are inverted and weak masering occurs in the cs j=1 - 0 transition .",
    "the emission can be further enhanced when the opacity is high enough to trap a significant fraction of the radiation . in this",
    "case photons are available to excite the molecules causing the excitation temperatures to be higher than with collisions alone .",
    "we found evidence of this radiative trapping when we put a lower density envelope around a cloud ( section 5.1.2 ) and when we replaced a cloud with a smaller , denser core surrounded by a larger , infalling envelope ( section 5.3 ) ; the results were a somewhat flatter and broader distribution of the maximum optical depths of transitions as a function of the value of j of the upper level and excitation temperatures which did not decline as steeply with j.    increasing the kinetic temperature enhances the emission in lines from the higher - energy transitions at the expense of lower - energy transitions , similar to increases in the density , but changes in the density are more effective because the range of reasonable densities ( @xmath18  @xmath11 ) is much larger than the range of reasonable kinetic temperatures ( 10 @xmath0 100k ) .",
    "because temperature is generally less effective , a constant value of 50k was used for the initial calculations .",
    "later we relaxed this constraint because the temperatures of the interior parts of the clouds could be several hundred degrees @xcite and higher temperatures help the models fit the higher energy transitions , especially the j=7@xmath06 transition whose upper level has a higher equivalent temperature than the 50k used in the initial calculations .",
    "when more than one cloud is present along the line of sight , the combination of the contributions from the separate clouds can make it difficult to determine the characteristics of the individual clouds .",
    "for example , it is difficult to separate the effects of turbulent velocity and the relative velocities of the clouds when two ( or more ) clouds contribute to a line profile .",
    "the solid line in figure 1a shows the profile of the j=3@xmath02 transition of cs in the direction of h  ii region a that would be produced by just clouds a and g of the multi - cloud model ( discussed below in section 5.1 ) .",
    "the dashed line in that figure is the profile if the turbulent velocity in each cloud is increased by 50% , to 9.0 km  s@xmath1 . in figure 1b , the solid line is the same as before , but the dashed line now shows the effect of changing the relative speed between the two clouds .",
    "the turbulent velocity remains fixed ( at 6.0 km  s@xmath6 , same as for the solid line ) , but the relative speed between the two clouds has almost doubled ( 4.8 to 8.8 km  s@xmath6 ) .",
    "the fwhm of the two dashed curves are the same and the heights are nearly the same .",
    "the profile where the turbulent velocities have been increased is narrower at the top and broader at the base than the profile due to the moving clouds , but the differences are rather subtle .    when more that one cloud is present , it is sometimes useful to set the velocities of the clouds to very different values to see what the contribution of each cloud is to a given profile .",
    "figure 1c shows the 5 , cs j=2@xmath01 profile in the direction of h  ii region b in the preliminary multi - cloud model . in this figure",
    "the velocity of the cloud at a has been subtracted from each of the cloud velocities .",
    "figure 1d shows the effects at b of the four clouds artificially separated in velocity that contribute to the profile . in this figure",
    "the velocity of cloud a has been subtracted from each of the clouds and then 30 km  s@xmath1 has been added to the cloud g , 60 km  s@xmath1 to g , and 90 km  s@xmath1 to a. it is apparent from these figures that a contributes to the right part of the profile , g to the left , g reduces the right - hand part , and a produces the shoulder on the right .",
    "although the tools used for this analysis assume locally spherically symmetric flow , we can treat multiple such volumes .",
    "however , true 3-d flow , bipolar outflows , and disk rotation can not be modeled by the these tools .",
    "we started with the colliding clouds model because some of the individual clouds developed for this model are used in the other models .",
    "this model evolved into a multi - cloud model .",
    "@xcite proposed a model consisting of three dense clumps .",
    "we consider their central clump near h  ii region g and their southwestern clump centered on h  ii region a. when we tried the parameters for the clumps given by serabyn et al . , the model line strengths were much larger than observed .",
    "we ran a number of cases and found a set of parameters which lead to profiles that match the line strengths and shapes of the lines rather well except the predicted strengths of the j=7@xmath06 lines at 20  in the directions of a and g are too weak ( figure 2a , 2b ) , the model does not produce the absorption observed on the high - velocity side of the j=2@xmath01 profile towards g in the 5  bima observations ( fig 2d ) , and the predicted strengths of the j=2@xmath01 lines at 20  in the directions of a and g are too weak(figure 2e ) . the 7@xmath06 transition will play a critical role in deciding which models are acceptable .",
    "we tried adding a low - density envelope to the uniform cloud ( clump ) around h  ii region a. this envelope does not change the fit to the j=2@xmath01 profile at a , but it does produce absorption at g , and the absorption is on the high - velocity side of the profile due to the relative motion of the clouds .",
    "however , the velocity at which the absorption appears is not high enough , and the strength of the emission in the direction of g is too low ( figure 3a , b ) .",
    "this model does produce a stronger j=7@xmath06 line in the direction of a ( figure 3c ) and line shapes that match the observed profiles of other transitions better than the models without an envelope around a. the increase in strength of the j=7@xmath06 line is due to line blanketing of the envelope causing an increase in the excitation temperature for that line inside the clump .",
    "we then tried a separate cloud , g in figure 12a , behind a ( so as not to cause absorption in the profile towards a ) , but in front of g to produce the absorption observed on the high velocity side of the j=2@xmath01 profile at 5  in the direction of g. figure 4 shows that the attempt was successful .",
    "the profiles match well except for the j=2@xmath01 transition at 20  and the j=7@xmath06 transition .",
    "to increase the j=2@xmath01 emission in a 20  beam , we increased the sizes of the clouds at a and g and reduced the molecular abundance to compensate for the increased path length , see figure 5 .",
    "we also looked at the j=2@xmath01 profile in the direction of h  ii region b and found that the cs emission from the clouds at a and g fully accounted for the cs emission observed at b. the final change we made at this stage was to add a cloud , a in figure 12a , at the relatively high velocity of 17 km  s@xmath1 behind the whole complex to account for the shoulder observed on the high velocity side of the profile at a , see figure 6 and table 2 .",
    "all the model profiles match the observed ones except j=7@xmath06 which are lower than observed .",
    "all of the clouds in this model are uniform .",
    "we call this model the preliminary multi - cloud model because , as we show below , clouds with non - uniform temperatures and densities give profiles that match the observations better .",
    "we find considerably lower h@xmath15 densities than @xcite , but our [ cs]/[h@xmath15 ] ratios are similar to those found by them and by others .",
    "serabyn et al .",
    "found the molecular hydrogen density to be @xmath21 @xmath11 in their central clump and @xmath22 @xmath11 in the southwestern clump .",
    "we find densities a little larger than @xmath23 @xmath11 for our clouds corresponding to these clumps .",
    "serabyn et al .",
    "use a ratio of [ cs]/[h@xmath15 ] ( per km  s@xmath1 ) of @xmath24 for both clumps .",
    "we find ratios of @xmath25 for the cloud corresponding to the central clump and @xmath26 for the southwestern one , and we find a turbulent velocity of 6 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "miyawaki , et al .",
    "( 1986 ) estimate the [ cs]/[h@xmath15 ] ratio to be less than or equal to @xmath27 .",
    "although the h@xmath15 densities of our clumps are lower than serabyn s values , the size of cloud g is larger , resulting in a much larger mass for it .",
    "serabyn et al .",
    "find masses for the clumps of @xmath28 to @xmath29 solar masses and a total cloud core mass of about @xmath30 m@xmath31 .",
    "miyawaki estimated the core mass as @xmath32 m@xmath31 to @xmath33 m@xmath31 .",
    "we find cloud masses of @xmath34 m@xmath31 and @xmath35 m@xmath31 for the two main clouds with @xmath36 m@xmath31 for the total .",
    "the discrepancy in the h@xmath15 densities of the clumps will be partially resolved when we discuss the core - envelope structure in section 5.3 . in this case , the central h@xmath15 densities are increased to @xmath21 @xmath11 .",
    "the v@xmath37 derived for cloud g agrees with the serabyn et al . velocity",
    "however , we find a v@xmath37 of about 9 km  s@xmath1 rather than 11.5 km  s@xmath1 works best for cloud a with additional , lower - density gas at v@xmath37 of 13 km  s@xmath1 and possibly also at 17 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "we next considered a model using the parameters of a cloud in free - fall collapse around h  ii region g from @xcite .",
    "we were able to reproduce our 5  beam cs j=2@xmath01 observations by using a [ cs]/[h@xmath15 ] ratio of @xmath38 .",
    "we added the cloud at a and the h  ii region at b from the multi - cloud model .",
    "the fit to the observed 5  j=2@xmath01 observations is satisfactory in the directions of h  ii regions a , b , and g ; however , the model profiles are too weak for the 20  j=5@xmath04 and 7@xmath06 observations",
    ". see figure 7 .",
    "the third set of models we considered consisted of in - falling clouds around each of the h  ii regions .",
    "this model was proposed by @xcite as a result of their analysis of the fragmentation of a rotating disk .",
    "our model went through several forms before arriving at one that matched the observations .",
    "we first considered uniform - temperature , in - falling clouds around each of the h  ii regions a , b , and g. this model was able to match the 5  j=2@xmath01 emission peaks in the directions of a and g , but the absorption on the high - velocity side of the profile at g was not as deep as observed , and there was too much emission in the direction of b. the emission at 20  resolution was not as strong as observed in any of the transitions .",
    "we next considered clouds in free - fall around each of the h  ii regions .",
    "the model 5  j=2@xmath01 profiles matched the observed profiles rather well , but all the 20  profiles were much weaker than observed .",
    "we then put a uniform cloud around each h  ii region inside the free - falling cloud .",
    "all the model profiles matched the observed ones with three exceptions .",
    "the 5  j=2@xmath01 profile in the direction of b was a little strong and not the right shape and the 20   j=2@xmath01 profiles in the directions of a and g were too weak . increasing the size of the cloud at a improved the fit of the 20  j=2@xmath01 profiles . increasing the size of the cloud at g did not help this fit .",
    "adding a small , uniform , low - density cloud in front of b , cloud b in figure 12b , moving at almost the speed of a improves the fit with the observed profile at b by absorbing some of the emission in that direction .",
    "physically , this material might be associated with a. the 20  j=2@xmath01 profiles are still a little weak , but the match of the model profiles to the observed ones is good for all the rest .",
    "see figure 8 .",
    "the local collapse model is better at matching the j=7@xmath06 line than either the multi - cloud or global collapse models .",
    "this is most likely due to the introduction of a core - envelope structure in cloud components for a and g. these clouds in the local collapse model have an 80@xmath39 smaller core with a density about 5 times higher than in the multi - cloud case and this core is surrounded by an extensive lower density envelope . as a result of these changes , the highest optical depth in the j=7@xmath06 line",
    "has increased by about 25@xmath39 in both clouds .",
    "the excitation temperature of the j=7@xmath06 line is about 16k throughout the clouds for the multi - cloud model and in the envelopes for the local collapse model .",
    "however , in the local collapse model , the excitation temperature rises to 35k in the center of the core for cloud a and to 70k in the center of the core for cloud g. the overall higher optical depths and excitation temperatures create the higher brightness temperatures needed to fit the observed intensity of the j=7@xmath06 line .",
    "the major deficiency of the preliminary models is the weakness of the j=7@xmath06 profiles for the multi - cloud and global collapse models .",
    "two changes come to mind that may allow these models to reproduce this transition : first , a higher kinetic temperature , perhaps with a gradient , so that there would be higher temperatures in the central regions where the density is high .",
    "second , a core - envelope structure which seems to have done the trick for the local collapse case and which was hinted at already in the two - clump model with an envelope around clump a.      we know from the 20 micron emission peak just north of the h  ii region g that there is hot dust in the central part of w49 @xcite .",
    "the physical conditions in such a situation have been described in a review article @xcite .",
    "the main effect for our study , is that near h  ii regions where the molecular hydrogen density is high , the gas temperature will be comparable to the dust temperature because of collisions . therefore , the kinetic temperature could reach several hundred degrees in the very center but fall off further out where the dust is less opaque",
    ". typically the temperature would decrease as @xmath40 @xcite .    to see the effects on the profiles of variations in the temperature , we modified the preliminary models as follows : 1 ) changed the kinetic temperature from the constant 50k of the preliminary models to a constant 100k , 2 ) introduced a radial decrease in the temperature of @xmath40 from a high of 100k at the center , and 3 ) same as case 2 but with t=200k at the center .",
    "for each of these temperature structures we spread out the cloud components in velocity space ( similar to what was done in section 4.2.2 fig .",
    "1c ) to see which components contributed most to the emission along the different lines of sight . for the core - envelope in - fall model",
    ", we separated the dense , uniform , turbulent , hot core with no in - falling motions from the lower density , lower temperature , collapsing envelope by giving each component its own offset in velocity .      as expected , increasing the temperature from 50k to 100k increases the strength of the j=7@xmath06 line so that it is a little stronger than is observed , and the profiles for the j=2@xmath01 transition are unchanged",
    "however , the j=5@xmath04 line is now much too strong . with a radial gradient in the temperature from a high of 100k at the center ,",
    "the j=7@xmath06 and j=5@xmath04 lines are too weak .",
    "they are weaker than when the temperature was a constant 50k .",
    "increasing the central temperature to 200k with a radial gradient causes the j=5@xmath04 line to match the observations , but the j=7@xmath06 line is much too weak .",
    "the effects on line profiles of changing the temperature structure in the global collapse model are similar to those in the multi - cloud model .",
    "while increasing the temperature to 100k strengthens the higher - level transitions , the j=7@xmath06 line is still too weak . adding a gradient in the temperature causes the j=7@xmath06 and 5 - 4 lines to be much weaker than is observed .",
    "the j=7@xmath06 line is still too weak even if the central temperature is increased to 200k with a gradient .",
    "the j=5@xmath04 line is about the right strength in the direction of a , but is too weak in the direction of g. for all of these temperature structures , almost all of the emission in the higher transitions comes from the cloud around h  ii region a.      increasing the temperature from 50k to 100k causes the j=7@xmath06 and j=5@xmath04 lines to be much stronger than the observed lines . adding a gradient in the temperature reduces the strength of these lines very nearly to what is observed .",
    "increasing the central temperature to 200k with a gradient makes the j=7@xmath06 and j=5@xmath04 lines too strong .",
    "they are about as strong as when the temperature was 100k without a gradient .      in section 5.1.2",

    "we now consider clouds having a static , turbulent core with free - fall in the surrounding volume .",
    "adding such a core - envelope structure to the global collapse model causes it to reproduce the j=7@xmath06 and 5@xmath04 transitions as well as the lower transitions .",

    "the comparisons are shown in figure 17 for the j=3@xmath02 transition , figure 18 for j=5@xmath0 4 , and figure 19 for j=7@xmath06 .",
    "we first tried constructing models by using c@xmath2s molecular data and decreasing the cs abundance by a factor of 22 @xcite , but we found that a factor of 15 for clouds a and a and a factor of 13 for the other clouds gave better fits to the observed profiles .",
    "the strengths of the predicted lines match the observed lines in all cases except the j=7@xmath06 transition towards a in the multi - cloud model .",
    "the weakness of the predicted line may be because this model is the only one in which cloud a does not have the core - envelope structure which we have found is important to produce strong j=7@xmath06 lines .",
    "we did not give cloud a this structure because the c@xmath5s j=7@xmath06 line from this model was only a little weaker than the observed line .",
    "in all cases the model profiles are symmetrical while some of the observed profiles show asymmetrical or double - peaked lines .",
    "these variations in the observed profiles may be due to noise , or they may indicate that the models need to include additional processes such as outflows , rotation , and clumps within an overall collapsing cloud .",
    "figure 6 of paper 1 shows that the integrated intensity of the cs j=2@xmath01 emission is elongated along a major axis which runs from the northeast to the southwest .",
    "the overall width of the cs emission perpendicular to the major axis at the 25@xmath39 level is about 4  and the width of the cs emission for the southwestern clump near h  ii region a at the 50@xmath39 level is 2 . except for the very low - density envelope of cloud g in the global collapse model which extends to 3 , the overlapping clouds in our various models extend to 1  or less .",
    "therefore , it is not surprising that predicted profiles for the j=2@xmath01 transition ( with 5  beam ) for positions away from g and a fall short of the observed strength of the cs emission .",
    "generally , lines - of - sight beyond the edge of a core but within the envelope of the nearest model cloud , a or g , are located within the 25@xmath39 to 50@xmath39 contours of the observed integrated intensity .",
    "the intensities of the predicted j=2@xmath01 cs profiles at such positions are 40@xmath39 to 50@xmath39 of the observed values .",
    "an exception is towards h  ii h whose projected position is just within the core of the g cloud and whose predicted intensity is 60@xmath39 of the observed intensity .",
    "we are obviously missing some components in our modeling such as any molecular gas around other h  ii regions ( besides a , b , g ) , serabyn et al.s northeastern clump , and perhaps an extensive region of low density gas into which the envelopes of the clouds merge .",
    "we used the three final models to predict the profiles that would be observed in the directions of h  ii regions a and g in the j=1@xmath00 transition at resolutions of 2  and 5 .",
    "the 2  profiles are shown in figure 20 and are deconvolved in figure 21 .",
    "the 5  profiles show the same features as the 2  ones .",
    "the main difference between the predictions of the three models is the depth and width of the absorption in the direction of h  ii region g. the absorption is much wider and deeper for the shu global collapse model than for the other two .",
    "the absorption for the multi - cloud model is about 50% deeper than for the local collapse model .",
    "there are subtle differences in the shape of the profile in the direction of h  ii region a. all the models predict a peak about 17 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "figure 21 indicates that this peak is due to cloud a. the profiles also show a peak about 10 km  s@xmath1 which is due to cloud a in the multi - cloud model and due to cloud b in the other two models .",
    "the predicted strength of this peak is greater than the one at 17 km  s@xmath1 for the shu global collapse and local collapse models , but the peaks are about the same strength for the multi - cloud model .",
    "we also used the models to predict the profiles in the j=5@xmath04 transition of cs at 2  and 5  resolution .",
    "the 2  profiles are shown in figure 22 , and the profiles at 5  are similar . at either resolution",
    "the peak in the direction of h  ii region a for the multi - cloud model is only about 60% as high as for the other two models .",
    "the shapes of the profiles predicted by all three models are symmetrical and are nearly the same .",
    "cloud a does not contribute significantly to any of the profiles .",
    "radiative transfer modeling of several transitions of cs did not allow us to clearly distinguish between the three models : multiple , static clouds ; global collapse ; or local collapse .",
    "parameters could be found for each of these models such that the theoretical profiles gave a reasonable match to the observed ones . following the referee s suggestion",
    ", we applied the final cloud models to other molecules , namely , hco@xmath3 and c@xmath4o , to see whether either molecule could be used to discriminate between the different models .",
    "the observations of hco@xmath3 are from @xcite , and the observations of c@xmath4o are from dickel et al .",
    "1999 .    in applying the cs modeling results to these other molecules , the only parameter allowed to vary is the relative abundance of the target molecule ; all other parameters remain fixed as given in tables 3 to 6 .",
    "we first applied the radiative transfer calculations to hco@xmath3 because the initial conditions for the global collapse model for cs came from the earlier modeling of hco@xmath3 @xcite . aside from the different relative abundance for the two molecules ,",
    "the main differences between the initial and final values of the cloud parameters in the cs modeling were the higher h@xmath15 density in the core and the lower h@xmath15 density in the envelope of cloud g , the higher kinetic temperatures in its core , and the additional cloud around h  ii region a.    for these new calculations , we used the parameters of the clouds determined from cs and an initial relative abundance for hco@xmath3 taken from the paper by dickel & auer . once a relative abundance was chosen ,",
    "that value was fixed  both between clouds and throughout a given cloud .",
    "we varied this value until we got the best compromise in matching the theoretical and observed profiles for hco@xmath3 for the j=1@xmath00 transition at 7  resolution towards the h  ii regions a and g and for the j=3@xmath02 transition at 24  resolution towards the h  ii region g. the relative abundance of [ hco@xmath3]/[h@xmath15 ] is low  about 10@xmath54 .",
    "unfortunately , the predicted intensity for the j=3@xmath02 transition was too high while that of the j=1@xmath00 transition was too low for all of the relative abundances considered .",
    "one way to remedy this situation would be to lower the h@xmath15 density in the core and raise it in the envelope of g , i.e. closer to what was used in the modeling by dickel & auer but that was not allowed in this exercise .",
    "therefore , instead , we decreased n(hco@xmath3 ) in the high density core and increased it in the low density envelope , but this change was inadequate as shown for best fit obtained for hco@xmath3 for the two collapse models in figure 23 and the multi - cloud model in figure 24 ( left side ) .",
    "we next considered the possibility of an error in the adopted dipole moment for hco@xmath3 , @xmath55 = 3.9 d @xcite .",
    "earlier ab initio calculations by @xcite gave a range between 3.3 dand 4.3 d. for optically thin lines , an increase in @xmath56 from 3.9 d to 4.3 d or a factor , f , of 1.1 would increase the einstein a transition probabilities , optical depths , and critical densities by f@xmath57 = 1.2 .",
    "such an increase in the critical density for the j=3@xmath02 transition would make it more difficult to excite and thus might lower its intensity while having little effect on the lower transitions .",
    "however , there was no perceptible difference between the theoretical profiles calculated using @xmath56 = 4.3 d and those run with @xmath56 = 3.9 d. lowering @xmath56 to 3.0 d lowered the intensities a little for both transitions .",
    "we conclude that changing the value of the dipole moment within reasonable limits does not improve the theoretical fits to the hco@xmath3 profiles .    at this point we considered what other differences between hco@xmath3 and cs might explain the poorer fit to the hco@xmath3 observations compared to the results of dickel & auer  for example , differences in excitation and/or where the molecules are located spatially .",
    "one such difference would be the presence of a bipolar outflow because the abundance and hence intensity of hco@xmath3 is often enhanced therein relative to cs .",
    "indications that bipolar outflows may be associated with h  ii regions a and g1&g2 in the w  49  a  north region are the fact that their continuum spectra are inverted and their recombination lines are very broad @xcite .    to investigate the effect of such an outflow on the resultant hco@xmath3 profiles , we added an outflow behind most of the other cloud components . because our code is not fully three - dimensional ,",
    "we attempted three approximations to the outflow : 1 . an expanding molecular shell , 2 .",
    "several `` bullet '' clouds along the line of sight towards g with velocities mimicking an outflow , and 3 . a similar series of bullets centered between h  ii regions a and g and extending to both a and g but with the outflow at an angle to the line of sight",
    ". however , for any of these to be successful , it is necessary to lower n(hco@xmath3 ) in the other cloud components by another factor of three .",
    "all these approximations to an outflow yield similar results . after expanding the calculations to c@xmath4o ( next section ) , we further modified the properties of outflow case 3 .",
    "figure 24 ( right side ) shows the resulting improvement in the match in the multi - cloud model when such an outflow is added .",
    "the results for the two collapse models are nearly identical to those of the multi - cloud model due to the fact that hco@xmath3 is so depleted in the clouds ( [ hco@xmath3]/[h@xmath15 ] @xmath58 10@xmath54 ) that the outflow dominates in producing the emission .",
    "we conclude that hco@xmath3 is no better than cs in distinguishing between multiple , static clouds and either of the collapse models .",
    "the flexibility and ease of use of the mc program was important in being able to create a model outflow using small clouds as building blocks and varying their location both along the line of sight and in the plane of the sky .",
    "we applied the same procedure to c@xmath4o and tried to fit the line profile of j=2@xmath01 observed with 12  resolution by @xcite toward h  ii regions a and g. the intensities and line widths are reproduced with a relative abundance , [ c@xmath4o][/h@xmath15 ] of about @xmath5910@xmath60 which is equivalent to [ co]/[h@xmath15 ] @xmath61 10@xmath62 and [ co]/[c@xmath4o ] between 300 and 3000 .",
    "the results are shown in figure 25 for the three models  multi - cloud , global collapse , and local collapse .",
    "although the overall fit is good , the details of the line shape are not reproduced .",
    "the emission from co is prominent in outflows so we assume that c@xmath4o is also present there . by reducing the relative abundance of c@xmath4o by two - thirds in clouds",
    "a and g and then adding an outflow ( above case 3 for hco@xmath3 ) , we end up with a surprisingly good match to the detailed shape of the c@xmath4o profiles seen towards both h  ii regions a and g as shown in figure 26 for all three models .",
    "the only exception is towards g in the global collapse case .",
    "these results strongly suggest that some kind of outflow is present in the region .",
    "the concocted outflow is only intended to be an approximation ; more accurate modeling is obviously warranted .",
    "nonetheless , this simple approximation both improves the hco@xmath3 fits and gives very good matches to the c@xmath4o profiles . for this outflow",
    ", we used four blobs , and each blob is about one - half the size of the core of cloud g. the other parameters of the blobs are similar to those found for the core of cloud g in the hco@xmath3 paper , e.g. the h@xmath15 density is closer to 10@xmath63  @xmath11 rather than the 5@xmath4310@xmath64  @xmath11 found in the cs modeling .",
    "there are no velocity gradients within a blob but rather the outflow is mimicked by spreading the blobs between h  ii regions a and g with the least positive velocity ( + 3 km  s@xmath1 ) just east of g and most positive ( + 13 km  s@xmath1 ) towards a in the case of c@xmath4o .",
    "the best parameters of the outflow for hco@xmath3 differ slightly from those for the best outflow for c@xmath4o in that hco@xmath3 requires a bit more turbulence in the blobs , and the outflow is shifted spatially and in velocity .",
    "there is additional hco@xmath3 in the outflow at + 1 km  s@xmath1 somewhat further to the east of g and very little hco@xmath3 in the outflow at + 13 km  s@xmath1 in the direction of a.    for hco@xmath3 the outflow emission dominates that from the other cloud components ; whereas for c@xmath4o the outflow plays a less prominent role . for c@xmath4o the outflow may be the cause of the asymmetry in the line profiles as it explains the shift in velocity of the peak of the emission profile between the directions of the h  ii regions a and g.",
    "for our radiative transfer modeling of w49a north , we concentrated on three competing dynamical models and modified the initial parameters of the constituent clouds to get the best fit to the cs observations .",
    "since this investigation began , new observations have become available , mainly concerning the embedded ultracompact h  ii regions which 1 ) show that the ring of h  ii regions is not rotating , and 2 ) tend to favor a picture of dense clumps embedded in an overall collapsing cloud .",
    "the evidence is as follows :    vla observations of nh@xmath65 emission and absorption by @xcite and our bima observations of cs ( j=2@xmath01 ) @xcite , both at 4   resolution , show the `` c '' shape in the position - velocity diagrams which is indicative of infalling motions .",
    "a hydrogen recombination study by @xcite indicates that the h  ii systemic velocities fall into several groupings , similar to the molecular clumps of @xcite .",
    "one of their major new findings is that the systemic velocity of h  ii region b is more likely to be 16.5 km  s@xmath1 ( from h52  @xmath66 ) rather than the earlier value of 2.5 km  s@xmath1 ( from h92  @xmath66 ) ;  note that we arrived at a systemic velocity of 15 km  s@xmath1 for cloud b by trial and error to obtain the best fits of cs profiles towards b. @xcite observed emission from dust and from ch@xmath67cn at 1.3 mm with the bima array and found both to be associated with some of the h  ii regions , in particular b , and the western part of g. from their analysis of very high resolution ( 0.045 ) vla images of the ultracompact h  ii regions , @xcite conclude that to confine them , the h  ii regions must be surrounded by very high density molecular gas ( @xmath6810@xmath69  @xmath11 ) and/or by turbulent gas . a further complexity in any modeling",
    "will be dealing with the possibility of ionized as well as bipolar outflows associated with h  ii regions whose continuum has an inverted spectrum ( i.e. the flux density is increasing rather than decreasing with frequency ) and whose recombination lines are very broad ( @xmath7045 km  s@xmath1 ) ; the prime candidates being h  ii regions a , and g1 & g2 .",
    "we tend to agree with @xcite who concluded from the above information that the ultracompact h  ii regions may be associated with and embedded within individual clumps that have fragmented within a collapsing cloud , but we must await further observations and modeling to confirm this emerging picture .",
    "we started by trying to fit the observed 5  j=2@xmath01 and 20  j=2@xmath01 , 3@xmath02 , 5@xmath04 , and 7@xmath06 cs profiles in the direction of w49a north using three different models : colliding clouds , global collapse , and localized collapse .",
    "we modified the parameters of these models until we got the best fits we could from each model .",
    "it is possible to find combinations of parameters for all three models that will reproduce the observations available to us except for the 20  j=2@xmath01 profiles observed in the direction of h  ii regions a and g. the final models do not predict as much emission in these profiles as is observed .",
    "there may be an extended region of emitting gas that is not modelled by our spherical clouds .",
    "the observations at our disposal do not constrain the models sufficiently to yield a unique solution . however , there are some features that any successful model must have : 1 ) h  ii regions at the observed locations .",
    "2 ) cs in emission towards h  ii regions g and a. 3 ) cs in absorption in front of h  ii region g and moving towards it at the proper speed to produce the absorption seen on the high - velocity side of the profile .",
    "the absorption indicates an excitation temperature in the cs j=2@xmath01 transition that is lower than the brightness temperature of the h  ii continuum background .",
    "this lower excitation temperature can be achieved by low h@xmath15 density in the foreground gas .",
    "this absorption is not in front of a. the gas doing the absorbing may be in a collapsing cloud centered on h  ii region g or in a separate cloud moving towards h  ii region g. 4 ) sufficient density and high temperature in the molecular clouds to give the observed strengths of the higher transitions of cs .",
    "we found that a core - envelope structure is an effective way to get the high - density region needed to reproduce higher transitions and the regions of lower density and temperature needed to reproduce lower transitions .",
    "our models indicate that high - resolution observations of the j=1@xmath00 and 5@xmath04 transitions of cs may distinguish between the models .",
    "the width and depth of the absorption in j=1@xmath00 towards h  ii region g should distinguish between the shu global collapse model and the other two .",
    "the presence of an emission peak or bump at 17 km  s@xmath1 in the profile for this transition towards a would confirm the existence of cloud a. the relative strengths of the peaks at about 10 km  s@xmath1 and 17 km  s@xmath1 in the j=1@xmath00 transition in the direction of a may distinguish between the multi - cloud and local collapse model and confirm the presence of cloud b. the strength of the line towards a in the j=5@xmath04 transition could distinguish between the multi - cloud model and the other two .",
    "our models match the intensity but not the shape of the c@xmath2s profiles at 20  resolution for the j=3@xmath02 , 5@xmath04 , 7@xmath06 transitions .",
    "the apparent asymmetry in the observed line profiles gradually shifts in velocity from the j=3@xmath02 to the j=7@xmath71 transition .",
    "when higher resolution observations of these optically thin transitions become possible with adequate sensitivity , they may better reveal the overall density structure in the w49a north region including whether the molecular density is enhanced around each of the h  ii regions .",
    "such information would provide additional constraints for future modeling although one would still have some flexibility in adjusting the relative abundance of cs and c@xmath2s .",
    "in expanding our modeling to include the molecules hco@xmath3 and c@xmath4o , the only parameter ( relative to the cs modeling ) that we allowed to vary was the relative abundance of the target molecule .",
    "good fits to the c@xmath4o profiles were obtained , but no values of the hco@xmath3 abundance could be found that would fit satisfactorily both the j=1@xmath00 and j=3@xmath02 lines .",
    "while the additional modeling of hco@xmath3 and c@xmath4o provided no clear indication as to which of the three models is the closest to reality , it did result in our adding a bipolar outflow which improves the fit to the hco@xmath3 profiles and nicely explains the changes in the asymmetries in the c@xmath4o profiles as a function of position .",
    "the poorer fit for c@xmath4o towards g for the global collapse model with or without an outflow gives a slight preference to either the multi - cloud model or the local collapse model over the global collapse model .",
    "the expanded modeling also highlighted the flexibility and usefulness of the `` mc '' program ( described in the appendix ) in exploring possible spatial configurations .",
    "observations to test the local - collapse model include high - resolution observations of sub - millimeter dust emission to determine whether there are individual clumps around the h  ii regions . at present , the results are inconclusive ; there is indirect evidence for dense molecular gas around the hii regions in order to confine them , and dust emission has been observed associated with ultracompact h  ii regions b and g1 & g2 . if the individual clumps around the h  ii regions are confirmed , then the velocity field could be probed with high - resolution observations of a molecular line which is both a high - density tracer and an optically thin transition .",
    "the parameters of our final models could be used as input to a two - dimensional radiative transfer code so that possible rotation of the system of clouds and bipolar outflows could be realistically investigated .",
    "the parameters we found could be used with a full three - dimensional radiative transfer code to properly treat multiple clouds embedded in a low - density envelope .",

    "the purpose of mc is to permit the user to investigate interactively the effect that changes in the assumed physical structure of the region have on the predicted outgoing radiation .",
    "mc is based on a plotting program written by l. h. auer .",
    "its inputs are the output files of rt , namely files of emergent intensity and optical depth as a function of impact parameter , velocity , and transition for a given molecule .",
    "mc also reads a user - created file which gives the number of clouds , the distance of the complex , the names of files containing observed profiles , and for each cloud in the model the names of the intensity and optical depth files from rt and the velocity and position offset of that cloud from the origin .",
    "the user interactively specifies the kind of plot : intensity versus position along a cut , intensity versus velocity , or intensity as a function of position and velocity .",
    "the user also specifies the beam size , the impact parameters for the profile or the position of the cut , the transitions to plot , and whether or not the continuum should be subtracted . for line profiles the user also specifies which observed profiles should appear in the plot .",
    "after the plot is produced , the user is given the option of making more plots with the same input files . while the program is running the user has the option of changing the velocity and/or position offset of any of the clouds .",
    "the outputs consist of the plot in the x windows tektronics window and in a postscript file which could be sent to a laser printer , a log file with the information from the user - created input file and the user s interactive inputs , and a file that contains the intensity versus velocity profiles that were computed to create the plot . for line - profile plots",
    "the rms difference between the model profile and the observed profile and some parameters describing the model profile are displayed in the x windows vt window and written to the log file .",
    "the display program , mc , computes the intensity along a given line of sight for a given velocity and transition as @xmath72 the sum is over the clouds in the line of sight from the most distant cloud to the closest .",
    "the @xmath73 is the intensity that has accumulated so far .",
    "for the first cloud it is the 3k background .",
    "@xmath13 is the opacity of the cloud along that line of sight for the given velocity and transition , and @xmath74 is the emergent intensity given by the program rt .",
    "the rt program correctly handles the effects of radiation on the populations of the energy levels in any one cloud , and the mc program assumes that the radiation from one cloud does not affect the populations of the energy levels of other clouds .    [",
    "[ justification - for - ignoring - the - effects - of - radiation - from - one - cloud - on - another ] ] justification for ignoring the effects of radiation from one cloud on another ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    this assumption is true only when the relative velocities of the clouds are large enough that the line profiles do not overlap . however , even when the profiles do overlap , radiation from locations within a particular cloud probably has more effect on the populations of the molecular energy levels within that cloud than radiation from an external cloud .",
    "this larger effect is because the solid angle subtended by the external cloud will usually be much less than that subtended by the cloud that the particular point is in .",
    "one can see from figure 27 that @xmath75 or if @xmath76 , then @xmath77 integrating over the portion of a unit sphere with polar angle @xmath78 gives the solid angle , @xmath45 , of the external cloud .",
