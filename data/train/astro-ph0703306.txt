    "hydrogen in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) is maintained in its highly ionized post - reionization state by the metagalactic ionizing background .",
    "this radiation is attributed to the integrated uv emission shortward of the lyman limit from young star forming galaxies and quasars , which is subsequently filtered and reprocessed as it propagates through the clumpy igm ( @xcite ) .",
    "observational constraints on the amplitude and spectral shape of the ionizing background can be used to infer the relative abundances of different uv photon emitting populations and their evolution ( @xcite ) .",
    "the integrated uv emissivity from galaxies can also be directly linked to the star formation density in the universe at a particular epoch ( @xcite ) , and the metagalactic hydrogen ionization rate is closely related to the evolution of the neutral hydrogen fraction in the igm ( @xcite ) .",
    "models of the metagalactic ionizing background are also an essential ingredient within hydrodynamical simulations of structure formation ( @xcite ) and provide the ionization corrections needed to infer the abundances of heavy elements in the igm from metal ion absorption lines ( @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , much effort has been directed towards constraining the nature and evolution of the ionizing background over a wide range of redshifts .",
    "numerical simulations of structure formation , combined with the opacity distribution observed in quasar absorption spectra , have enabled significant progress to be made in this field ( @xcite ) . however , at redshifts approaching and beyond the putative tail - end of the hydrogen reionization epoch at @xmath9 , determining the ionization state of the igm is still problematic ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) . it is generally agreed that by @xmath9 the ionizing radiation emitted by quasars alone is insufficient to reionize the igm ( @xcite ) . in addition , there have been some claims that the observed galaxy population at @xmath10 is also unable to produce the number of hydrogen ionizing photons needed to maintain the surrounding igm in a highly ionized state ( @xcite ) . however , other studies have indicated this deficit may not real ( @xcite ) , and may instead be attributable to an overestimate of the number of ionizing photons required to balance recombinations in the igm .",
    "there may also be a population of fainter galaxies which remain undetected .",
    "considerable uncertainties are also introduced when converting the galaxy luminosity function into a uv emissivity and hence an ionizing photon production rate .",
    "an assumption must also be made for the very uncertain escape fraction of ionizing photons from their respective galactic environments ( @xcite ) , which is likely to vary considerably ( @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we shall readdress the question of whether or not the observed ionization state of the igm at @xmath11 is consistent with the ionizing emissivity inferred from the observed space density of star - forming galaxies and quasars .",
    "we approach this issue with improved measurements of the metagalactic photoionization rate per hydrogen atom , @xmath12 , at @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "these are obtained from recently published measurements of the opacity in high redshift quasar spectra ( @xcite ) , combined with a large suite of high - resolution hydrodynamical simulations ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "these estimates represent the most detailed constraints on @xmath13 obtained at these redshifts using state - of - the - art hydrodynamical simulations , and the systematic uncertainties are carefully explored for a wide range of model parameters .",
    "these new data are then compared to the ionization rate inferred from our own estimates for the ionizing emissivity derived from published measurements of the space density of lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) and quasars , combined with a simple model for the mean free path of ionizing photons .",
    "we also compare this approach to that used by @xcite , who instead compared an estimate of the observed ionizing emissivity to that required to balance recombinations in a simple model where the inhomogeneous spatial distribution of the igm is characterised by an overall clumping factor . in this way",
    ", we derive an upper limit on the clumping factor from the @xmath13 we measure at @xmath7 .",
    "finally , we turn our new measurements of the ionization rate at @xmath11 into a measurement of the ionizing emissivity . given this constraint",
    ", we then explore the range of plausible evolutionary histories for the ionization state of the igm towards yet higher redshifts and compare these to recent observational estimates of the uv emissivity at @xmath8 .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe our procedure for estimating the metagalactic hydrogen ionization rate at @xmath0 and @xmath1 using measurements of the igm opacity and hydrodynamical simulations of the igm .",
    "we pay particular attention to the systematic uncertainties involved in such a measurement , and as such this work closely follows the methodology used by @xcite ( hereafter b05 ) .",
    "we refer the reader to this work for further details .",
    "in section 3 we discuss the model we use for the mean free path of ionizing photons , and in section 4 we use published lbg and quasar luminosity functions to directly compute the lyman limit emissivity at @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we discuss a model for spatial fluctuations in the ionizing background in section 5 .",
    "this is used to estimate the possible systematic effect these have on our measurements of @xmath13 . in section 6",
    "we compare the metagalactic hydrogen ionization rates inferred from both the opacity of the igm and the combined galaxy and quasar lyman limit emissivities , and in section 7 we discuss the corresponding comoving ionizing emissivity and its implications for the ionization state of the igm at @xmath14 .",
    "implications for future 21 cm experiments and the evaporation of mini - haloes are also considered .",
    "lastly , in section 8 , we summarise and present our conclusions .",
    "the hydrodynamical simulations used for this study were run using the parallel treesph code gadget-2 ( @xcite ) .",
    "our fiducial simulation volume is a periodic box @xmath15 comoving mpc in length containing @xmath16 gas and dark matter particles .",
    "we find this provides the best compromise between accuracy and speed .",
    "star formation is included using a simplified prescription which converts all gas particles with overdensity @xmath17 and temperature @xmath18 into collisionless stars .",
    "the uniform uv background model of @xcite ( hereafter hm01 ) including emission from quasars and galaxies is employed in the optically thin limit , and the ionization state of the gas is computed using the non - equilibrium ionization algorithm of @xcite .",
    "the simulations were all started at @xmath19 , with initial conditions generated using the transfer function of @xcite .",
    "the cosmological parameters of the simulations used in this study are listed in table 1 , with the final column listing the factor by which the photo - heating rate is artificially raised to explore the effect of gas temperature on the inferred @xmath13 .",

    "this occurs at progressively earlier redshifts for either a larger value of @xmath27 or a smaller value of @xmath40 .",

    "the filling factors so far were obtained assuming a source spectral index of @xmath45 .",
    "as discussed in some detail by @xcite , a harder spectral index will increase @xmath27 .",
    "as an example , adopting @xmath49 doubles the @xmath27 we infer at our anchor point of @xmath13 at @xmath7 .",
    "the solid line labelled model 2b in fig .",
    "[ fig : fill ] shows @xmath47 computed for a constant @xmath27 twice that in model 2 .",
    "the resulting @xmath47 evolution is very similar to model 3 and is now consistent with hydrogen reionization being complete by @xmath7 . on the other hand , adopting a softer spectral index of @xmath50 ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) would push reionization to even later times , requiring an even larger increase in @xmath27 to achieve @xmath39 by @xmath7 .",
    "our adopted value for the clumping factor at is less of a concern .",
    "even if we assume a uniform igm ( @xmath51 ) , model 2 still only predicts @xmath39 by @xmath52 .",
    "in addition , the clumping factor will become larger towards lower redshifts .",
    "finally , we note that a particularly hard spectral index has implications for the reionization history .",
    "the much larger ionization threshold of singly ionized helium relative to neutral hydrogen ensures that reionization is postponed until sources with sufficiently hard spectra become numerous .",
    "quasars are likely to be the primary source of these energetic photons , and there is some evidence that the tail - end of reionization does roughly coincide with the peak in the quasar number density around @xmath53 ( @xcite ) . however , a spectral index of @xmath46 at @xmath54 would result in an earlier reionization epoch , at odds with the current observational evidence .",
    "it may therefore be possible to rule this scenario out .",

    "@xmath59 is the residual neutral hydrogen fraction in an ionized region with overdensity @xmath60 and @xmath61 is the upper limit for the gas overdensity in the igm , which we take to be @xmath62 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we compute @xmath59 at a particular overdensity assuming ionization equilibrium , and then integrate over the volume weighted probability distribution of the gas density , @xmath63 . since there are no measurements of @xmath13 at @xmath14 we have no independent constraints on the mean free path .",
    "we therefore adopt an upper limit of @xmath64 comoving mpc at @xmath14 . in practice , since @xmath39 occurs at @xmath65 for all three models , changing the mean free path ( or indeed @xmath63 , which is also rather uncertain ) does not substantially change the @xmath66 we derive .",
    "as already discussed , the main uncertainties in the calculation at @xmath14 are the values adopted for @xmath48 and @xmath40 .",

    "the values we infer for the volume weighted neutral fraction are in good agreement with the recent data from @xcite at @xmath9 , shown by the open circles .",
    "the solid line corresponds to @xmath66 computed at intervals of @xmath70 using the updated ionizing background model of hm01 for galaxy and quasar emission .",
    "there is also very good agreement between this model and the data based on the igm effective optical depth .",
    "observational constraints on @xmath66 at @xmath14 using alternative observational techniques are also shown .",

    "[ fig : fh1 ] corresponds to the upper limit on @xmath66 at @xmath71 obtained from the spectrum of grb 050904 by @xcite .",

    "note , however , that the estimates of the neutral fraction based on the observed near - zone sizes alone are ambiguous ( @xcite ) ; the near - zone data is also consistent with an igm which is highly ionized at @xmath73 .",
    "the open square corresponds to the upper limit on @xmath74 obtained by @xcite from the observed evolution in the emitter luminosity function between @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "however , this estimate is also subject to considerable uncertainties ( @xcite ) .",
    "the estimates for @xmath66 computed with equations  ( [ eq : fh1 ] ) and ( [ eq : fh1b ] ) for the three @xmath77 models at @xmath78 are shown as the dotted , dashed and dot - dashed lines .",
    "the filling factor , @xmath47 , is computed assuming @xmath41 .",
    "model 1 is inconsistent with all the observational constraints on @xmath66 at @xmath78 .",
    "similarly , although model 2 predicts a somewhat smaller @xmath66 at @xmath78 , hydrogen reionization is still not complete by @xmath7 , in disagreement with the neutral fraction inferred from the igm effective optical depth .",
    "hence the values of @xmath66 predicted by both model 1 and 2 lie well above the measurements from the data at @xmath79 . only model 3 ( and also 2b , not shown ) is in agreement with the data .",
    "we may also briefly discuss to what extent the three models are consistent with current constraints on the integrated reionization history from the cosmic microwave background .",
    "the recently re - evaluated value for the electron scattering optical depth is @xmath80 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the electron scattering optical depth may be computed as ( _ e.g. _ @xcite )    @xmath81    where @xmath82 is the thomson cross - section . the cumulative contribution to @xmath83 as a function of redshift is shown in the right hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fh1 ] for our three models .",
    "as might be expected , only model 3 is consistent with the current constraints on @xmath84 .",
    "note again that we have arbitrarily assumed that the ionizing emissivity is zero at @xmath31 . obviously for model 2 and 3",
    "the value of @xmath83 would be larger for an earlier start of reionization .",
    "free electrons left after recombination may also increase @xmath83 somewhat ( see @xcite for a recent detailed discussion of these issues ) .",
    "even for a hard spectral index for ionizing photons , @xmath85 , the comoving ionizing emissivity at @xmath7 inferred from the data is so low that the epoch of reionization has to extend over a wide range in redshift .",
    "this is obviously excellent news for upcoming 21 cm experiments as there should be plenty of structure observable in 21 cm emission over the full accessible frequency range of planned experiments .",
    "it appears likely that a significant fraction of the igm is still neutral at @xmath86 , which would bode particularly well for observations of regions around early ionizing sources by upcoming 21 cm experiments such as lofar ( _ e.g _ @xcite ) .",
    "the only downside regarding 21 cm experiments is that there is little hope for those experiments aimed at a detection of a global , sharp reionization signal ( @xcite ) .",
    "an extended photon - starved epoch of reionization also has important implications for the photo - evaporation of mini - haloes , _",
    "i.e. _ dark matter haloes with virial temperatures below @xmath87 .",
    "the virial temperature of these haloes is too low for collisional cooling by atomic hydrogen to be efficient .",
    "prior to reionization they are thus expected to be filled with neutral hydrogen . however , after reionization commences they will be photo - evaporated as photoionization raises the gas temperature above the virial temperature of the halo .",
    "the number of photons per hydrogen atom in the halo needed for photo - evaporation , and hence the duration of the photo - evaporation process itself , will therefore depend on the number of recombinations occurring .",
    "@xcite studied this in detail for a large suite of radiative transfer simulations . for haloes at the upper end of virial temperatures with total masses of about @xmath88 and photo - evaporating ionizing fluxes that corresponds to our measured photoionization rate at @xmath7 , the time needed for photo - evaporation approaches a gyr .",
    "unless the ionizing emissivity rises dramatically at @xmath14 the photoionization rate towards higher redshift will be even lower .",
    "it should therefore take until about @xmath89 to fully photo - evaporate the most massive mini - haloes .",
    "this would support the suggestion of @xcite that a significant fraction of observed lyman limit systems , which increase in number with increasing redshift , are due to optically thick neutral hydrogen in mini - haloes .",
    "we have obtained new measurements of the metagalactic hydrogen ionization rate at @xmath0 and @xmath1 using a large suite of hydrodynamical simulations combined with recent measurements of the igm effective optical depth ( @xcite ) .",
    "we carefully take into account the various systematic errors associated with determining @xmath13 at these redshifts .",
    "we find @xmath90 at @xmath0 and @xmath91 at @xmath7 , where the largest contributions to the uncertainties come from the poorly defined thermal state of the igm and measurements of the effective optical depth .",
    "we also investigate the impact of ionizing background fluctuations on the inferred values of @xmath13 , and find that these add an additional uncertainty of about @xmath92 per cent .    using a physically motivated model for the ionizing photon mean free path",
    ", we compare our constraints on @xmath13 to the expected ionization rate calculated from the observed galaxy and quasar population at @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we find that , even for conservative estimates regarding the spectral shape of the uv emission of these sources , the combined ionizing emission from galaxies and quasars is capable of maintaining the igm in its highly ionized state if @xmath93 .",
    "ionizing emission from star forming galaxies is likely to dominate the total ionizing photon budget at these redshifts .",
    "the clumping factor of ionized hydrogen should also be substantially less than the often used value of @xmath94 at @xmath79 .",
    "our measurements of @xmath13 and estimates of @xmath95 suggest @xmath96 at @xmath7 , although the clumping factor will increase towards lower redshift .    using our estimates of the ionizing photon",
    "mean free path we have turned our measurements of @xmath13 from the effective optical depth into a measurement of the emission rate of ionizing photons per unit comoving volume at @xmath97 .",
    "we find that @xmath98 assuming @xmath99 above the lyman limit frequency .",
    "a harder spectral index of @xmath100 would double @xmath27 . for @xmath101 and @xmath102",
    "the value of @xmath27 at @xmath7 corresponds to around @xmath103 and @xmath104 photons emitted per hydrogen atom over a time interval corresponding to the age of the universe at @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "reionization must therefore have occurred in a photon - starved manner unless the ionizing emissivity during reionization is substantially larger than at @xmath105 .",
    "we have discussed three simple extrapolations of @xmath27 at @xmath14 .",
    "an ionizing emissivity which decreases rapidly towards higher redshift , consistent with recent upper limits on the uv emissivity from lbgs at @xmath14 ( @xcite ) , can be ruled out based on the ionization state of the igm at @xmath33 .",
    "consistency with the completion of reionization before @xmath7 as inferred from the @xmath106 in the igm , as well as the recently re - determined electron scattering optical depth , is achievable if the ionizing emissivity at @xmath14 increases above its inferred value at @xmath7 .",
    "alternatively , consistency may also be achieved if the @xmath3 luminosity density and the star formation rate remain constant while @xmath107 increases at @xmath14 , or the spectrum of emitted ionizing photons becomes increasingly harder at high redshift .",
    "recent studies of lbgs at @xmath108 suggest that typical uv selected star - forming galaxies become younger with increasing redshift ( @xcite ) , which may be a hint in this direction .",
    "reionization by an early population of sources such as mini - quasars or population - iii stars with particularly hard spectra ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) would be an extreme form of such a scenario .",
    "assuming @xmath109 ( _ e.g. _ mhr99 ) , a constant ionizing emissivity of around @xmath110 is required for reionization before or at @xmath7 .",
    "this is at the upper end of some of the recent first attempts to constrain the uv luminosity density at @xmath14 ( @xcite ) .",
    "there is thus reason for optimism regarding future searches for the uv emission from high - redshift galaxies .",
    "note , however , that the required @xmath3 luminosity density could be smaller if the uv spectrum of the galaxies is harder or the escape fraction is larger than we have assumed .",
    "the photon - starved nature of reionization suggested by the forest data at redshift @xmath0 and @xmath7 means that the epoch of reionization has to extend over a wide redshift range and is unlikely to have been completed much before @xmath7 . in turn",
    "this implies a rather early start of reionization as suggested independently by the cmb data .",
    "there should thus be plenty of structure due to the epoch of reionization observable in 21 cm emission over the full accessible frequency range of planned 21 cm experiments .",
    "the photon - starved nature of reionization also means that the photo - evaporation of the neutral hydrogen in mini - haloes with virial temperatures below @xmath111 should extend to redshifts well below the tail - end of the hydrogen reionization epoch .",
    "the alternative is that the igm was rapidly reionized at very high redshift by an as yet unidentified population of sources which have disappeared by @xmath112 .",
