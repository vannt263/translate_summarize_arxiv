    "calorons are finite action ( anti-)self - dual ( ( a)sd ) solutions of the yang - mills gauge theory on @xmath1 . along with their periodic instanton picture ,",
    "they can be interpreted as the compound objects of constituent monopoles from the perspective of loop group gauge theories @xcite .",
    "the intriguing feature of calorons is that they can be endowed with a non - trivial holonomy around the periodic direction , which will serve as an approximation to skyrmions @xcite .",
    "hence , calorons give a connection between instantons , monopoles and skyrmions .",
    "there has been formulated a systematic method to construct instantons , the atiyah - drinfeld - hitchin - manin ( adhm ) construction @xcite .",
    "nahm has applied the adhm construction for calorons as well as monopoles @xcite , known as the nahm construction . in this formulation ,",
    "gauge fields of calorons can be obtained by solving a one - dimensional weyl equation on finite intervals with  impurities \" at the boundaries .",
    "the dual gauge connection in weyl operators and the impurities are called the bulk nahm data and the boundary nahm data , respectively . the transformation from the nahm data to the corresponding gauge connections is called the nahm transform . since the nahm data are defined in terms of quite complicated functions , we need numerical analysis to perform the nahm transform , in general .",
    "the nahm transform for su(2 ) caloron of instanton charge @xmath2 with non - trivial holonomy was , however , studied analytically @xcite . for the higher charges ,",
    "some exact calorons of @xmath0 were found in @xcite .",
    "the authors demonstrated that the nahm data written by the standard jacobi elliptic functions works well for the case of calorons .",
    "the numerical nahm transform has been discussed in somewhat different context , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we perform the numerical nahm transform for su(2 ) calorons of instanton charge @xmath0 , referred to as 2-calorons , in detail . for a given instanton charge , calorons are classified by the constituent monopole charge and mass , respectively . here",
    "we consider the case of monopole charge @xmath3 and mass @xmath4 , which corresponds to the 2-caloron without net magnetic charge , and accompanied with trivial holonomy .",
    "recently , the 2-caloron nahm data of monopole charge @xmath3 of arbitrary mass with 16 moduli parameters has been proposed in @xcite . since the dimension of framed moduli space of su(2 )",
    "@xmath5-caloron is @xmath6 @xcite , this 2-caloron nahm data gives the most general gauge fields .",
    "we carry out here the nahm transform for the 10 parameter subset of the 2-caloron nahm data whose holonomy is trivial , as a primary work for the general cases with non - trivial holonomy .",
    "the role of each parameter will be clarified in the following sections .",
    "we should mention the relationship between the earlier works on the nahm transform of calorons and the present work . in @xcite",
    ", the authors considered the nahm transform by utilizing the green function method .",
    "in contrast , we concentrate here on the nahm transform by solving numerically the weyl equations with impurities .",
    "these two ways lead , of course , equivalent results for various physical quantities such as action density of field configuration .",
    "however , we expect that the solutions to the weyl equations in the presence of impurities and their numerical code considered here make a crucial contribution to the progress of nahm transform for diverse objects @xcite , and also d - brane theories , _ e.g. _ , @xcite .",
    "this letter is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we give a brief review on the nahm transform of calorons . in section 3 ,",
    "we make a formulation for numerical analysis to the weyl equations with impurities . in section 4",
    ", we consider the action density of 2-caloron and give the interpretation of moduli parameters .",
    "section 5 is devoted for concluding remarks .",
    "in this subsection , we give a brief review of the nahm transform for su(2 ) @xmath5-caloron with trivial holonomy . as mentioned in introduction , the nahm data of calorons",
    "consists of the bulk nahm data and the boundary nahm data .",
    "the bulk one is @xmath7 hermite matrices @xmath8 periodic in @xmath9 with period @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "they are smooth functions except for at the boundaries , with fundamental interval , say , @xmath13 . for the gauge field to be asd , they are subject to the nahm equations , @xmath14 - \\frac{\\mathrm i}{2}\\varepsilon_{ijk}\\big[t_j(s ) , t_k(s)\\big ]      = 0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the roman subscripts are @xmath15 or @xmath16 , together with the reality conditions @xmath17 . on the other hand ,",
    "the boundary nahm data is given by a @xmath5-row vector @xmath18 of quaternion entries , enjoying the matching conditions @xmath19 where @xmath20 s are the pauli matrices and the trace is taken over quaternions .",
    "the link between the nahm construction of calorons and that of monopoles is as follows . in the construction of monopoles",
    ", the nahm data should also enjoy ( [ eqn : the bulk nahm equation ] ) and have simple poles at the boundary of the interval @xcite to give correct asymptotic forms of the higgs fields .",
    "we can make use of their  non - singular parts \" as the bulk nahm data of calorons @xcite , which are piece of the monopole data attached with the shorter segment of the interval .",
    "if we take the monopole limit of the calorons , the interval @xmath21 eventually fills the characteristic period of the bulk data so that the simple poles appear at the boundaries , accordingly the matching conditions erupt in certain cases .",
    "the caloron gauge fields in the real , or configuration space are obtained from the nahm data through the zero modes of the weyl equations with impurities at the boundaries . denoting a ",
    "spinor \" @xmath22 defined on @xmath21 with period @xmath10 and a single quaternion @xmath23 , the weyl equations are @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the @xmath26 unit matrix and @xmath27 are the basis of the quaternion .",
    "we write these zero modes into components as @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , @xmath32 are @xmath33-column vectors and @xmath34-column vectors , respectively . by using them , we can separate ( [ eqn : the weyl equation ] ) into two equations , the bulk weyl equations on @xmath21 @xmath35 and the matching conditions at the boundary @xmath36 where @xmath37 .",
    "the next step is to find two independent pair of the zero modes @xmath38 , @xmath39 , orthonormalized as @xmath40 where @xmath41 .",
    "putting together these zero modes , we obtain the asd gauge connection of calorons as @xmath42 as mentioned in introduction , we have to perform the nahm transform by numerical analysis , which is the main aim of this letter . note that the numerical nahm transform for monopoles was vigorously studied by houghton and sutcliffe @xcite .      in this subsection",
    ", we introduce an exact nahm data of the 2-caloron , for which we perform the nahm transform in the following sections . in @xcite , the bulk nahm data of the 2-caloron on an interval is given in the following form @xmath43 the solutions to the nahm equations ( [ eqn : the bulk nahm equation ] ) are @xmath44 with @xmath45 where @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 are jacobi elliptic functions of modulus @xmath5 , and @xmath49 .",
    "the monopole limit of this bulk data is obtained by putting @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "note that @xmath52 is not a physical parameter for the trivial holonomy calorons and also monopoles , because it can be removed by a spatial rotation ( see section iv ) .",
    "however , we keep it for the purpose of generalization to the non - trivial holonomy cases , and also the reliability check of the numerical code .    next , we consider the matching condition ( [ eqn : the matching condition ] ) for the 2-caloron . in accordance with @xcite , we employ the following parameterizations for the boundary nahm data @xmath53 then ( [ eqn : the matching condition ] ) reads @xmath54 from the boundary values of the bulk nahm data given above , we find @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 note that all the parameters are assumed to be real number . consequently , the moduli parameters of the 2-caloron of trivial holonomy are the following 10 , @xmath58 which are subject to the constraint ( [ eqn : remaining matching condition ] ) .",
    "in this section , we give the strategy on finding out the numerical solution to the weyl equations with boundary impurities , which is based on the construction of monopoles _ a la _ houghton and sutcliffe @xcite . from the nahm data ( [ eqn:2-caloron bulk data ] ) , the bulk weyl equations ( [ eqn : the weyl equation ] ) can be written for the components of @xmath59 as    @xmath60    this system of ordinary differential equations can be solved by the runge - kutta method with appropriate initial conditions . for the nahm transform of calorons , as well as monopoles , what we need is the basis of 2-dimensional vector space spanned by the solutions to ( [ eqn : decomposed bulk weyl equation ] ) normalizable on @xmath21 . to employ the monopole construction procedure",
    ", we have to integrate ( [ eqn : decomposed bulk weyl equation ] ) starting from the simple poles of the nahm data .",
    "the positions of poles are @xmath61 , obviously read from ( [ eqn : bulk solutions ] ) and ( [ eqn : coefficients of the bulk data ] ) .",
    "from the nahm construction of calorons , @xmath62 s are assumed to be located on the outside of @xmath21 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath63 .",
    "if we represent ( [ eqn : decomposed bulk weyl equation ] ) at each pole in the following concise form @xmath64 where @xmath65 is a regular matrix , then the vector space dimensions of independent solutions which are normalizable are given by the number of positive eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath66 @xcite . in the present case , we evaluate that the eigenvalues at each pole are , respectively , @xmath67 for an arbitrary @xmath52 .",
    "hence , we find the vector space dimensions are three for each pole . in terms of frobenius expansion at the poles , we can find a couple of free parameters . appropriately tuning these parameters",
    ", we obtain the three independent initial conditions at each pole . in this way",
    ", we can compute the array of independent solutions @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is at most 6 .",
    "the 2-dimensional basis @xmath70 , @xmath71 , can be obtained by taking linear combinations of these solutions , @xmath72 where @xmath73 are @xmath69-column vectors , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath74 , to be fixed below .",
    "the evaluation of @xmath73 is not so straightforward for calorons , as well as monopoles . for the monopole construction @xcite ,",
    "@xmath73 is determined by the condition that a linear combination of the solutions , integrated from one pole , matches a linear combination of the solutions from the other pole , at the center of the interval . in this way",
    ", we find the 2-dimensional basis of the vector space .",
    "for the caloron construction , the situation is slightly different .",
    "we are able to compute the solutions in the whole interval at once without taking linear combination .",
    "instead , we have to find out the solutions to the boundary weyl equations ( [ eqn : boundary weyl equation ] ) simultaneously , which should be consistent with the boundary nahm data .      for an appropriately defined @xmath70 ,",
    "the boundary weyl equations ( [ eqn : boundary weyl equation ] ) with the boundary nahm data ( [ eqn : matching condition ] ) are @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the equations seem to be an _ over - determined system _ for @xmath78 , but that is not true because the left - hand side is not determined at this stage .",
    "our goal is to determine the coefficients of the linear combination @xmath73 in ( [ eqn : linearcombination ] ) and @xmath79 , simultaneously , for the given bulk nahm data @xmath68 .",
    "this procedure can be reduced to the problem of linear algebra as follows .",
    "first , we solve the upper two rows of ( [ eqn : boundary weyl equation2 ] ) as @xmath80 by substituting ( [ eqn : the solutions of the boundary weyl equation ] ) into the lower two rows , we find ( [ eqn : boundary weyl equation2 ] ) becomes the constraints on @xmath81 as @xmath82 the next step is to fix @xmath73 which is consistent with ( [ eqn : conditions to remove overdetermined ] ) . from the definition ( [ eqn : linearcombination ] ) , @xmath83 is expanded as @xmath84 where @xmath85 .",
    "note that @xmath81 and @xmath86 s are 4-column vectors .",
    "now , we can rearrange ( [ eqn : conditions to remove overdetermined ] ) , by using ( [ eqn : linear combination of l.h.s . ] ) , into a linear equation for @xmath81 @xmath87 this can also be regarded as the linear defining equation for @xmath88 . since the number of constraints on @xmath88 in ( [ eqn : conditions to remove overdetermined 2 ] ) is two , we have to take at least four solutions of the bulk weyl equation , to obtain two independent solutions @xmath88 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the 2-dimensional basis @xmath70 . to determine the independent solutions @xmath89 to ( [ eqn : conditions to remove overdetermined 2 ] ) , we simply perform the gauss elimination ( fig.[fig : solve_weyl_eqn ] ) .",
    "having obtained the independent @xmath89 , we take the linear combination ( [ eqn : linear combination of l.h.s . ] ) , and find the components of @xmath81 automatically satisfy ( [ eqn : conditions to remove overdetermined ] ) . the solutions of the boundary weyl equation have already been given by ( [ eqn : the solutions of the boundary weyl equation ] ) . our method to solve the weyl equations",
    "is schematically illustrated in fig.[fig : solve_weyl_eqn ] .          to investigate the configuration of calorons in the configuration space ,",
    "it is useful to visualize the action density , which is gauge invariant and positive real definite . with the fact that the field strength of calorons @xmath90 $ ] is an anti - symmetric tensor and the ( a)sd conditions @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , the action density of calorons can be written as @xmath94 thanks to the ( a)sd conditions",
    ", we do not have to calculate the  time \" @xmath95 derivative in the field strength so that we can regard @xmath96 as a parameter in the calculation .",
    "we perform the visualization of the action density of the caloron , mainly by mathematica  @xcite .",
    "combining all these procedures , we now compute the action density of the calorons , a typical gauge invariant quantity .",
    "however , when we carry out the program , we always observe unexpected singularities of line form . in the calculation of the zero modes of the weyl equation",
    ", we always have a trivial phase factor , which depends on the configuration space coordinates .",
    "these factors inevitably cause effect to the gauge field through a finite difference method of ( [ eqn : the nahm construction ] ) . for the analysis of the monopoles @xcite , on the contrary ,",
    "no such singularities occur .",
    "the finite difference of the zero modes is taken after the trace for quaternion , which successfully cancels jump or twist of the phase of the zero modes .",
    "these singularities , however , have no essential ingredients so we employ the following simple procedure to remove them",
    ". we can identify numerically the location of the singular lines , which depends on the initial conditions of the runge - kutta method .",
    "for example , a solution has a singular line located on the upper hemisphere of the configuration space while another has it on the lower hemisphere .",
    "thus , we obtain the regular action density by a patchwork with two or three parts of the solutions with different parameter sets , by choosing their intersection is regular .",
    "we employ 50 grid points for the dual space , and @xmath97 lattice points for the configuration space , which are sufficient for the numerical convergence .",
    "+     +            +     +          having established the formulation for calculating the action density , our main concern is to clarify the role of the moduli parameters of the 2-calorons , which are listed in ( [ eqn : moduli parameters ] ) .",
    "first , we consider a very simple case @xmath98 with the positive sign in ( [ eqn : remaining matching condition ] ) . in this case , @xmath99 can easily be solved as @xmath100 where @xmath101 , which gives the rotation symmetric 2-caloron of trivial holonomy obtained in @xcite .",
    "the constant surface of the action has a toroidal shape , as expected .",
    "as the time coordinate @xmath96 varies , the surface still keeps its torus configuration : when we increase @xmath96 from @xmath102 , the action density gradually reduces its absolute value and almost fades away at @xmath103 , and it returns to its initial value at @xmath104 .",
    "now , we consider the general case accompanied with all the moduli parameters ( [ eqn : moduli parameters ] ) .",
    "the quadruplets @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 are the parameters of parallel transformation in @xmath1 . substituting ( [ eqn:2-caloron bulk data ] ) into ( [ eqn : the weyl equation ] )",
    "one can easily see that for a parameter scaling @xmath109 , @xmath110 is absorbed into @xmath111 as @xmath112 .",
    "it is already known for the bps 2-monopoles that the modulus @xmath5 is a parameter of the geodesic motion of the monopoles .",
    "the situation is similar for the 2-calorons . in fig .",
    "[ fig : isoaction_plot ] , we present the action isosurface plots for several values of @xmath113 , which show the dynamical motion of the constituent monopoles .    next , we consider @xmath114 , which can be identified as a scale parameter of the caloron . under a scale transformation with @xmath115 being an arbitrary constant ,",
    "@xmath116 the bulk and the boundary nahm data , ( [ eqn : bulk solutions ] ) , ( [ eqn : remaining matching condition ] ) are invariant .",
    "if we fix the poles of the bulk data located on @xmath117 , which gives a constraint on @xmath114 as @xmath118 , then we can find a similar functional form for the bulk data as we change the value of @xmath114 and @xmath10 , simultaneously .",
    "this means that the change of @xmath114 leads the rescaling of the range of @xmath21 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath10 .",
    "now , the weyl equation ( [ eqn : the weyl equation ] ) keeps invariant if the additional conditions are satisfied @xmath119 which obviously describe the spatial rescaling of the solution .",
    "note that as @xmath9 reduces , @xmath111 increases at the same order .",
    "hence , we conclude that @xmath114 works as a scale parameter of the solution .    the triplet , @xmath99 , @xmath120 , and @xmath121 , are the boundary data of the 2-caloron . as discussed in @xcite , _ the symmetric calorons _",
    "are defined such that they are invariant under the group @xmath122 as @xmath123 where @xmath124 and @xmath125 is a unit quaternion .",
    "@xmath126 is the rotation matrix acts on the quaternion coordinate .",
    "similarly , @xmath127 is the @xmath5-dimensional irreducible representation of a rotation which acts on @xmath5-column vectors .",
    "one can easily confirm that for rotations about @xmath128-axis , ( [ eqn : axially symmetric condition ] ) is satisfied only for @xmath129 .",
    "this means that the calorons are not always axially symmetric even if the bulk data is invariant .",
    "we summarize figures of the action density to the non - axially symmetric 2-calorons with the same bulk data to the rotation symmetric 2-calorons in figs .",
    "[ fig : action_density_psi_rho1 ] and [ fig : action_density_psi_rho2 ] .",
    ".the role of each moduli parameter . [ cols=\"^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table : the roles of each parameters ]    finally , we consider @xmath52 , which describes a rotation around @xmath128-axis in @xmath130 , as mentioned in section ii .",
    "this is because the bulk data can be written as ( for positive sign ) @xmath131 and @xmath52 can be set to @xmath132 by the rotation of quaternion @xmath133 by @xmath134 , together with the rotation on the weyl spinors .",
    "thus , this parameter is dummy in the case of the 2-caloron of trivial holonomy . for the 2-caloron of non - trivial holonomy",
    ", however , this becomes a crucial parameter because it has a meaning of the relative rotation angle of the constituent monopoles .",
    "hence , we have found full understandings for all parameters .",
    "the results are summarized in table [ table : the roles of each parameters ] .",
    "in this letter , we have performed the nahm transform numerically by directly solving the weyl equations with boundary impurities for the 2-calorons of trivial holonomy , with 10 moduli parameters subject to 1 constraint .",
    "for the boundary equation , we have proposed the systematic method to extract appropriate 2-dimensional basis of the system by taking linear combinations of solutions of the weyl equation .",
    "the action density plots are qualitatively similar with those of @xcite , which are based on the green function method .",
    "the method presented in this letter is essentially equivalent to @xcite .",
    "for the most general 2-calorons , with non - trivial holonomy , the program will also work well , though we need to solve more complicated matching conditions .",
    "the role of the moduli parameters in this object is still not fully understood .",
    "the analysis for such case is now in progress .",
    "the atiyah - manton construction of skyrmions has already been generalized to the case of finite temperature , by making use of calorons of trivial holonomy @xcite . for the study of a high energy collision of the nucleon or a high density phase of the nuclear matter",
    ", it will be valuable to consider the approximation to skyrmions in more general situations .",
    "it is extremely interesting whether or not the calorons of non - trivial holonomy play a significant role in this subject .",
    "the analysis will be reported in forthcoming articles .",
