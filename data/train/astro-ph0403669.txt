    "ngc5253 is a starbursting dwarf elliptical galaxy which lies at a distance of @xmath10  mpc ( freedman et al .",
    "2001 ) and with an inclination of 67@xmath11 ( the mean value quoted by the lyon / meudon extra - galactic database [ leda ] ) .",
    "the signature of wolf - rayet stars have been detected in the nucleus of the galaxy ( schaerer et al .",
    "1997 , walsh & roy 1987 ) implying that this is a young starburst and as such allows an opportunity for the study of the starburst phenomenon in its earlier stages of development and its effect on galaxy evolution in the local universe .",
    "in fact , rieke , lebofsky & walker ( 1988 ) went so far as to classify it as one of the youngest starbursts known .",
    "dwarf galaxies , as the basic building blocks in the hierarchical merging cosmology scenario , are likely to have harboured the earliest sites of star - formation in the universe and so their study in the local universe can give insight into the evolution of such objects at high redshift .",
    "observations of local edge - on starburst galaxies ( strickland et al .",
    "2000 ; weaver 2001 ) are presenting a picture of kpc - scale , soft x - ray emitting , bipolar outflows in the form of galactic winds transporting mass , newly synthesised heavy elements and energy into the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "a similar outflow is seen in the dwarf starburst galaxy ngc1569 ( martin , kobulnicky & heckman 2002 ) , while the dwarf ngc4449 shows what may be the beginnings of a galactic wind emerging from an extended superbubble ( summers et al .",
    "the same situation seems to be the case in the ngc3077 dwarf ( ott , martin & walter 2003 ) .",
    "these winds result from the pressure driven outflows along these galaxy s minor axis produced from the efficient thermalization of the mechanical energy from the supernovae ( sn ) explosions and stellar winds of the massive stars in their ob associations and super star - clusters ( ssc ) .",
    "ngc5253 being both inclined to our line - of - sight and young presents a less clearly observable picture .",
    "its youth means that it is unlikely to have developed a superwind and the diffuse x - ray emission observed is much more likely to be associated with multiple superbubbles around its ob associations and ssc , as suggested from earlier _ rosat _ observations of this galaxy ( strickland & stevens 1999 ) .",
    "observations of ngc5253 at radio wavelengths have shown it to have a very flat centimetre - wavelength continuum which is indicative of thermal emission from hii regions , with only low levels of synchrotron emission from supernova remnants ( beck et al .  1996 ; turner , ho & beck 1998 ) .",
    "ferrarese et al .",
    "( 2000 ) quote a low metallicity of @xmath12 , based on the work of webster & smith ( 1983 ) .",
    "this figure suggests that a large amount of metal enrichment has not occurred in the central hii regions , and may be further evidence of the youth of the starburst region .",
    "the total and hi masses for the galaxy are calculated to be @xmath13 and @xmath14 from 21  cm observations ( reif et al .",
    "1982 ) , corrected for the difference in assumed distance to ngc5253 .",
    "later vla 21  cm observations show ngc5253 to be peculiar , in so much as its neutral hydrogen appears to rotate about the optical major axis of the galaxy ( kobulnicky & skillman 1995 ) .",
    "however , co observations ( turner , beck & hurt 1997 ; meier , turner & beck 2002 ) detect sources which are coincident with the dust lane seen to the se of the nucleus of the galaxy in optical images , and these co clouds appear to be infalling into ngc5253 .",
    "consequently , the dynamical situation in ngc5253 , rotation or infall , is not completely clear .",
    "infrared emission is detected from what seems to be a highly obscured , massive ( @xmath15 stars ) , small ( @xmath16 a few pc diameter ) and very young globular cluster in the central starburst region of the galaxy ( gorjian , turner & beck 2001 ) .",
    "this source contributes @xmath17 of the total observed infrared luminosity of the galaxy .",
    "a summary of some of the properties of ngc5253 is given in table  1 , along with estimates of the current star - formation rate of the galaxy estimated from far - infrared and h@xmath2 fluxes .",
    "caldwell & phillips ( 1989 ) , using broadband multicolour ( ubv ) ccd images , narrow - band h@xmath2 and long - slit caii triplet spectra , determined that ngc5253 had undergone an increased rate of star - formation throughout the galaxy about @xmath18  yr ago , as suggested by the presence of over 100 star clusters of a similar age lying outside the nuclear region .",
    "they also established that the intense star - formation now occurring in the nuclear region of the galaxy began around 10  myr ago , giving an upper limit for the age of superbubbles associated with it .",
    "more recently , tremonti et al . ( 2001 ) analysed several clusters in ngc5253 , determining ages in the range of 1 to 8  myr .",
    "calzetti et al .",
    "( 1997 ) also noted two other clusters with older ages , determined to be between 10 and 50  myr .",
    "the two very bright sn explosions seen in this galaxy in 1895 and 1972 are amongst the apparently brightest recorded extra - galactic sne ( ardeberg & de groot 1973 ) and may be associated with the large scale star - formation , although neither was particularly centrally located .",
    "the fabry - perot h@xmath2 images of marlowe et al .",
    "( 1995 ) show that the ionized gas in the galaxy has a complex distribution , consisting of a bright central region extending @xmath19 from the centre in a n - s direction , embedded within a system of loops and filaments , with an overall extent of @xmath20 . to the nw and wsw of the centre",
    "are 2 large superbubbles with diameters @xmath21 , expanding at @xmath22 , while to the east side of the galaxy , a pair of radially oriented filaments are detected .",
    "this latter observation is suggestive of the rupture of a superbubble blown by the stellar activity in the central regions .",
    "ngc5253 has previously been observed at x - ray wavelengths with the _ einstein _ ipc ( fabbiano , kim & trinchieri 1992 ) and both the _ rosat _ pspc ( martin & kennicutt 1995 ; stevens & strickland 1998 ) and hri ( strickland & stevens 1999 ) .",
    "the _ einstein _",
    "ipc and _ rosat _ pspc results showed soft thermal x - ray emission from what appeared to be an extended source , suggestive of a luminous superbubble .",
    "the better spatial resolution of the _ rosat _ hri instrument detected a complex of at least five x - ray sources , that could be young superbubbles blown by individual young star clusters in the starburst region .",
    "the total x - ray luminosity determined from these observations was similar and lies in the range of @xmath23 , depending on the value adopted for the absorbing column density .    in section 2",
    "we describe the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations .",
    "the x - ray emission from the whole galaxy , the point sources and the diffuse emission are discussed in section  3 .",
    "section  4 contains a more general discussion of the morphology of the x - ray emission and its relationship to emission from other wavebands , along with a determination of the dynamics of the expanding superbubbles of the central region and their effect on ngc5253 .",
    "our main conclusions are summarised in section  5 .",
    ".details of ngc5253 .",
    "the distance is from freedman et al.(2001 ) , other data is from the leda and ned databases .",
    "the infrared luminosity @xmath24 is calculated using the 12 , 25 , 60 and @xmath25 m iras fluxes ( sanders & mirabel 1996 ) and the h@xmath2 luminosity is from marlowe et al .",
    "( 1997 , corrected for distance ) .",
    "the corresponding star - formation rates ( sfr ) for both the ir and h@xmath2 luminosities are calculated using the conversion formulae in kennicutt ( 1998 ) . [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      a background and point source subtracted spectrum of the region containing the diffuse emission was extracted from the _ chandra _ data only , as the spatial resolution of _ xmm - newton _ was inadequate for resolving the point sources within the central region .",
    "this diffuse emission spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "[ diffspec ] .",
    "the fitted model shown is an absorbed three component fit having two thermal components and a power - law component - @xmath26 .",
    "the fit gives @xmath27  @xmath28 , @xmath29  @xmath28 and @xmath30  @xmath28 , for the fitted absorbing column densities of the cool , warm and power - law components respectively .",
    "the fitted temperatures are @xmath31 for the soft component , and @xmath32 for the medium component , while the fitted photon index for the power - law component is @xmath33 .",
    "the metallicities for the two thermal components were fitted simultaneously , with @xmath34 .",
    "the absorption corrected fluxes ( and percentage contributions ) in the @xmath35 energy band in each of these three components were : cool thermal : @xmath36  @xmath28 ( @xmath37 ) ; warm thermal : @xmath38  @xmath28 ( @xmath39 ) and power - law : @xmath40  @xmath28 ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "the errors shown here are the @xmath42 confidence levels for the normalisation value obtained from the fit .",
    "this result suggests that the diffuse emission consists of at least two components at different temperatures and many unresolved point sources .",
    "as discussed in section  3.1 , several of the point sources in the central region of ngc5253 could be young superbubbles and the subtraction of such sources could therefore remove a substantial fraction of the diffuse emission . comparing the fluxes above with those obtained from the analysis of the total emission",
    "gives the result that the point source subtraction has removed @xmath43 of the cool thermal emission , @xmath44 of the warmer thermal emission and @xmath45 of the emission attributed to the power - law component , but these figures do not take account of the fact that the fitted values for the absorbing column densities have changed between the two fits . re - fitting the diffuse emission with the values fitted for the total emission and only allowing the normalisations for the individual components to be free gives reductions in the fluxes that correspond to @xmath46 for the cool thermal emission , @xmath47 for the warmer thermal emission and @xmath48 for the emission from the power - law component .",
    "this does suggest that the cooler thermal component is affected less by the point source subtraction and so probably lies further away from the point sources and star - clusters than the warmer component . when sources 16 , 17 , 18 and 20 are not subtracted from the total emission and this modified emission is fitted as above with only the normalisations of each component as free parameters , the reduction in the fluxes for each component",
    "are : cool thermal : @xmath49 ; warm thermal : @xmath50 ; power - law : @xmath51 .",
    "these figures suggest there is emission from all three components of the fit associated with these four sources , with maybe slightly more of the warmer thermal component than the other two , and yet the temperatures measured for them during the spectral fitting was of the order of that of the cooler component .",
    "as their contribution is not a substantial fraction of the total emission in all three components , there inclusion in the source subtraction does not effect the fluxes measured for the diffuse emission greatly .",
    "other parameters of the two gas components have been calculated , from the spectral fits to the _ chandra _ data for the diffuse emission and the _ xmm - newton _",
    "data for the total emission .",
    "the results are shown in table  7 , including the effect of a filling factor @xmath6 , and within errors most of the calculated values agree between the two data sets .",
    "the implications of these figures for the evolution of ngc5253 will be discussed further in section  4 .",
    "the assumption of spherical symmetry and a filling factor of unity are both likely to be overestimates , resulting in the quoted figures being underestimates for @xmath52 and @xmath53 and overestimates for @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( see strickland & stevens 2000 for a discussion of filling factors and their likely values in galactic winds ) .",
    "overall , the metallicity of the hot x - ray emitting gas is similar to that obtained from optical spectroscopy of the central hii regions ( webster & smith 1983 ) of the galaxy .",
    "compared to other dwarf galaxies though , the values of @xmath34 from the diffuse x - ray data and @xmath57 from the optical data are low .",
    "typical values for some other dwarfs are : mrk  33 : @xmath58 ( legrand et al .",
    "1997 ) ; ngc4449 : @xmath59 for the x - ray emitting gas ( summers et al .",
    "2003 ) ; ngc1569 : @xmath60 for the x - ray emitting gas and a mean value of @xmath61 for the ism material ( martin et al .  2002 ) . in a further attempt to investigate the metallicities of the thermal components , and in particular the ratio of the @xmath2-elements to fe , the spectrum was re - fitted using variable abundance mekal models ( _ vmekal _ ) for the two thermal components .",
    "the abundances of the two thermal components were tied and the individual abundances of mg , ne , si and ca relative to solar values were tied to that of o to form the group of @xmath2-elements .",
    "the abundances of all the other elements were set to the global value determined above . the @xmath62 ratio obtained in this way",
    "was found to have no significant difference to the solar value at @xmath63 .",
    "the confidence contour plot for these fits is shown in fig .",
    "[ alphaelem ] , showing that the @xmath2 and fe abundances are highly correlated , and that the fitted ratio is @xmath64 .",
    "we note that this is somewhat in contrast to the values of martin et al .",
    "( 2002 ) for the dwarf starburst ngc1569 , where values of the @xmath2 to fe abundance ratio of @xmath65 times the solar value are quoted ( and in the case of ngc1569 the photon statistics are rather better than for ngc5253 ) .",
    "this value for ngc5253 is more in line with the value of @xmath66 found for the dwarf starburst ngc4449 ( summers et al .",
    "2003 ) and may be indicative of differences in the contributions made to the hot gas from sne in these different starbursts .",
    "the high values quoted for ngc1569 suggest the presence of more type ii sne , which would be expected if its current starburst phase is @xmath67  myr old as suggested in the literature on this starburst ( e.g. , israel & de bruyn 1988 ; gonzlez - delgado et al .",
    "1997 ; hunter et al .",
    ". such activity would give rise to more @xmath2-elements , as would a pattern of shorter more intense bursts of star formation .",
    "the fact that ngc5253 has shown a fairly uniform rate of star - formation throughout the galaxy over the last @xmath68  yr ( caldwell & phillips 1989 ) , would suggest that , with the exception of the current burst in the very central region , which could be very young and hence have little type ii sne activity at present , its star - formation and energy injection from star - forming regions has been generally of a more continuous nature .    from table",
    "4 , it can be seen that there is little temperature variation evident within the sources , that appear to be extended ( 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 and 20 ) , in the central region of ngc5253 , with the exception of source 16 in the sw being cooler than the rest .",
    "the absorbing column densities fitted to them are also fairly consistent and there is overlap seen between adjacent sources within errors .",
    "the dust lane in ngc5253 bisects the nuclear region such that sources 18 and 19 lie to the north of it and sources 16 , 17 and 20 are to the south . from the hardness ratios and source counts in various energy bands shown in tables  5 and 6 , the two northern sources are harder than those in the south , suggesting that they should be either hotter or lie behind larger absorbing columns .",
    "source 17 s temperature and 16 s absorbing column density would argue against this .",
    "the latter could be explained by the western side of the galaxy being tilted away from us .",
    "the low count - rate statistics however , hamper the drawing of any firm conclusions , though the results do suggest that these objects are similar in nature to each other .    also , from the 3 colour _ chandra _ image , further differences can be seen in the nature of the point sources in these three energy bands .",
    "sources 17 , 18 , and 20 all appear very red on the three colour image , reinforcing their similar nature .",
    "sources 16 and 19 show slightly different behaviour , by having more emission in the medium band than the other three sources , which is reflected in their yellow colour on fig .",
    "the diffuse emission is mainly confined to the central region of the galaxy , and the peak of its emission is centred on the region occupied by sources 17 , 18 and 19 , which also corresponds to the region of peak intensity in the h@xmath2 emission .",
    "the images of the _ xmm - newton _ data shown in figs .  [ mosaic ] and  [ xmmchan ] show that the diffuse x - ray emission extends away from the central region in several directions , although as stated earlier most of the extension to the sw appears to be associated with point sources .",
    "this is confirmed by the log - log plot of the radial surface brightness profile shown in fig .",
    "[ rad ] , produced by extracting the counts from 20 concentric annuli each with a width of @xmath69 centred on a position coincident with the centre of the @xmath70 ellipse at @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "this figure shows that the diffuse emission can only be traced out to a distance of @xmath73 ( 0.53  kpc for our assumed distance ) before it falls to a level comparable to that of random background fluctuations .",
    "the preferred directions for the observed extensions in the diffuse emission seem to be along the minor axis of the galaxy , both to the nw and se . if these extension in the diffuse x - ray emission are due to superbubbles and superwinds then their activity should have swept - up shells and produced filaments which should be evident in the h@xmath2 image of the galaxy . to look for such evidence , of correlations between the extended x - ray emission and structure within the h@xmath2 emission ,",
    "x - ray contours from the point source and background subtracted diffuse emission have been overlaid on the h@xmath2 image of the central region of ngc5253 .",
    "in addition , the detected sources in the central region of the galaxy ( sources 1522 ) are also overlaid on the image to show the relative positions , and extent of these sources ( as determined by the _",
    "program ) , compared with the regions of increased star - formation on the h@xmath2 image .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ hax ] and the correlations between the various components are discussed further in section  4.1.1 . as a further comparison between emission at different wavebands , fig .",
    "[ opt ] shows the positions of the six largest star clusters found in the central region of ngc5253 overlaid on the _ chandra _ soft ( @xmath74 ) and medium ( @xmath75 ) smoothed images of the galaxy along with the positions of the x - ray sources 1522 as shown in fig .",
    "these images show only two strong correlations between the most northern and southern star clusters shown here and x - ray sources .",
    "most of the soft x - ray emission occurs between and around these large star clusters in regions where many smaller clusters are to be found .",
    "the second most northern of these large star clusters shown on these images has four smaller clusters in close proximity to it , yet it appears to have little x - ray emission close to it .",
    "however , these clusters are located at the western end of the dust lane , which is most likely responsible for the absorption of the x - ray emission seen both in these images and on fig .",
    "it is apparent from fig .",
    "[ hax ] that both the diffuse x - ray emission and the h@xmath2 emission are mainly confined to a region of radius @xmath76  kpc in the centre of ngc5253 .",
    "the most intense x - ray emission is coincident with the most intense emission seen in the h@xmath2 image in the northern half of the nucleus , suggesting that this emission is associated with the increased star - formation occurring in these regions . in general , higher column densities were fitted for the sources to the w and s of the galaxy , as seen in table  4 , and would suggest that these areas lie further away from us behind more absorbing material than the n and e of the galaxy .",
    "this would mean the minor axis lies away from our line - of - sight ( tilted both to the n and w ) , and that the galaxy is also rotated about this axis in such a way that the southern side of the galaxy disk is tilted away from us , consistent with ngc5253 being a dwarf elliptical galaxy that is inclined to our line - of - sight .",
    "the bulging of the diffuse emission seen to the nw and se in the x - ray contours and _ xmm - newton _ images , could be indicative of a bipolar outflow along the minor axis of the galaxy , as would be expected from standard superbubble models ( weaver et al .  1977 ) .",
    "ngc5253 contains many regions of increased star - formation within the central region of the galaxy , which are clearly visible in h@xmath2 observations , with the most intense regions being seen in the north of the nucleus , coincident with the end of the dust lane and weak co emission ( turner et al .",
    "this is the region that contains two of the brightest star - clusters analysed by tremonti et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and corresponding to our detected x - ray sources 18 and 19 .",
    "the extension seen in the diffuse emission to the wnw of this region could be the result of an outflow induced by the stellar winds of the massive stars present in these star clusters .",
    "this region also lies close to the position of the ` radio super - nebula ' discussed by gorjian et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , which they have interpreted as an highly obscured , very young globular cluster , rather than an obscured agn ( see also mohan , anantharamaiah & goss 2001 ; turner et al .",
    "2003 ) .    as well as many of the star clusters coinciding with x - ray sources , some of the filamentary and shell - like structures seen in h@xmath77 images seem to have counterparts in the diffuse x - ray emission .",
    "the small h@xmath2 shell seen to the sse in fig .",
    "[ hax ] appears to be filled with diffuse x - ray emission and the radial filament extending off the h@xmath2 image to the ese is also associated with what appears to be a filamentary extension of the diffuse x - ray emission .",
    "the field - of - view of the h@xmath2 image shown in fig .",
    "[ hax ] is too small to show the @xmath64  kpc shells detected to the west of the galaxy by marlowe et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , but these can be seen in fig .",
    "2j of martin ( 1998 ) .",
    "the orientation of the more northern of these two shells is roughly aligned with the galaxies minor axis . the slow expansion speed of these shells [ @xmath78 ( marlowe et al .  1995 ) ] and the fact that the diffuse x - ray emission does not extend out to them , as shown in the radial surface brightness plot of fig .",
    "[ rad ] , may mean that these shells are not associated with the current burst of star formation but are remnants of earlier starburst activity .",
    "the presence of more than one bubble having been blown close to the minor - axis on the west side suggests that what is being seen in this galaxy is much more complex than the simple bipolar outflow scenario assumed to explain the effect of starburst activity",
    ". this phenomenon could be the result from a young starburst , in so much as the outflows from individual star - clusters may not have overlapped or merged to produce what would be observed as a single outflow .",
    "the presence of the dust lane bisecting the nuclear region may also be acting in such a way as to channel any superbubbles so that they expand preferentially into areas where the density of the ambient ism is less .",
    "the possible dynamics of such superbubbles will be discussed later .",
    "strong mid - infrared emission ( gorjian et al .",
    "2001 ) is detected from a source in the northern half of the central region of the galaxy just at the northern edge of our detected sources 18 and 19 .",
    "this is an extremely compact source occupying a region with diameter @xmath79  pc and needing to contain @xmath80 stars to supply its ionization requirements .",
    "this object is most likely a very young ( no more than a few @xmath81 years old ) globular cluster .    just to the south of this infrared emission , at a position corresponding to our source 19 ,",
    "is the peak of the 2 cm radio emission ( beck et al.1996 ) .",
    "while mainly concentrated in the northern half of the central region of the galaxy , some 2 cm emission is also detected at the positions of our sources 17 and 20 but not coincident with source 16 .",
    "this radio emission has a flat spectrum , with a spectral index of @xmath82 , which is attributed to thermal bremsstrahlung emission from the hii in the region .",
    "relatively low levels of non - thermal synchrotron emission are seen in ngc5253 ( turner et al.1998 ) , which is unusual for a starburst galaxy and again suggests that the starburst occurring in the central region of ngc5253 could be young .    as mentioned earlier , vla 21",
    "cm observations of ngc5253 have suggested that the bulk of the hi rotates about the galaxy s major axis ( though see meier et al .",
    "2002 for evidence of infall into ngc5253 ) .",
    "fig .  1 of kobulnicky & skillman ( 1995 )",
    ", shows that the neutral gas extends to about twice the optical extent of the galaxy along its minor axis , occupying a region of @xmath83 in diameter .",
    "this is well beyond the extent of the diffuse x - ray emission and h@xmath2 emission seen in the central region .",
    "the peculiar rotation could result from large - scale outflow along the minor axis , but such behaviour should give rise to a shell - like centrally evacuated structure in hi emission , as seen in the @xmath64  kpc h@xmath2 shells . the column density measured for the hi increases towards the centre and peaks at a position close to our detected source 20 .",
    "this is offset by about @xmath84 from the peaks of emission seen at shorter wavelengths and is in the southern rather than northern half of the galaxy , however this does coincide with the point where the dust lane enters the nuclear region from the ese .",
    "although at present there does not appear to be a clearly defined single superbubble structure within ngc5253 , the presence of hot , over - pressured gas with a long cooling time , should lead to an outflow from the central region . with this in mind , in this section",
    "we apply the standard superbubble model to the hot gas of ngc5253 to investigate the potential of the galaxy to deposit energy , metal - enriched material and ism material into the intergalactic medium .",
    "the age of the current burst of star - formation in the centre of ngc5253 is not well determined , and probably does not have a single age .",
    "the comparative lack of a non - thermal signature in the radio - spectrum ( beck et al .  1996 ; turner et al .",
    "1998 ) may suggest a lack of supernova activity and the detected presence of wolf - rayet stars ( schaerer et al .",
    "1997 ) in regions corresponding to our detected source 19 suggest that star - formation has been occurring for only a few myr in this region .",
    "typically ages for star clusters in ngc5253 reported in the literature are : 7.9  myr ( marlowe et al .  1999 ) ; 2.8  myr and 4.4  myr for two separate regions within the nucleus ( schaerer et al .",
    "1997 ) ; 2  myr for the brightest star cluster ( tremonti et al .",
    "2001 ) ; 5  myr ( martin & kennicutt 1995 ) ; 3  myr ( mas - hesse & kunth 1999 ) , though as noted earlier there are some older clusters ( calzetti et al .",
    "1997 ) , and indeed these older star - clusters can still be contributing mechanical luminosity .    based on these figures we adopt an age of 5  myr for the current starburst , in order to perform some analysis of the dynamics of the probable superbubbles in ngc5253 .",
    "we recognise the limitation of this approach in such a complex system as ngc5253 , where the star - formation is not co - eval .",
    "the northern star - clusters in ngc5253 are younger and here the analysis may be useful .",
    "the bulk of the diffuse x - ray emission is confined within a radius of @xmath85 ( 0.53  kpc for our assumed distance ) , that corresponds to the same region containing the majority of the h@xmath2 emission as shown in fig .",
    "[ hax ] . for simplicity",
    "this will be treated as a single superbubble resulting from the combined action of the multiple star - clusters within the starburst . the dynamic time required for the two @xmath64  kpc h@xmath2 shells detected by marlowe et al .",
    "( 1995 ) to have evolved is @xmath86  myr , assuming they have had a constant expansion velocity of @xmath87 ( marlowe et al .",
    "1995 ) for this time .",
    "this value is greater than the estimated duration of the current burst of star - formation , and the diffuse emission does not appear to extend this far out . however , this figure is also likely to be an over estimate since their speed will have been greater in the past , which would bring their expansion times closer to the higher age estimates of the star clusters .",
    "these observations raise the question of what is responsible for their existence which will be discussed further later .",
    "the combined action of the stellar winds of the massive o and b stars in the star - forming regions in the centre of ngc5253 will blow a superbubble that can be modelled using the starburst driven outflow models of castor , mccray & weaver ( 1975 ) and weaver et al .",
    "in such models , the stellar winds from the ob associations sweep up and shock a thin , dense h@xmath2 emitting shell of ism material , with a contact discontinuity just behind the shell , separating the shocked wind material from the shocked ism material .",
    "the innermost region of the bubble will contain the freely expanding supersonic wind bounded by an inward - facing shock . in the ` snow - plough ' phase",
    ", the shocked wind material occupies most of the bubbles interior and most of the bubble s mass is contained in the h@xmath2 shell .",
    "the expansion of the bubble is driven by the over - pressured interior , which , as can be seen from the figures of table  7 is of an order of magnitude greater than typical values for the ambient ism within the milky way which is @xmath88  dyn  @xmath28 .",
    "the radius @xmath89 and expansion velocity @xmath90 , of the bubble during this phase , are given by    @xmath91    @xmath92    where @xmath93 is the mechanical luminosity injected by the starburst in units of @xmath94 , @xmath95 is the age of the starburst in units of @xmath96  yr and @xmath97 is the ambient atomic number density of the ism .",
    "the mechanical luminosity ( @xmath98 ) injected by the starburst can be estimated from the stellar populations in the starburst .",
    "marlowe et al.(1999 ) have performed a detailed analysis of the starburst in ngc5253 , using starburst evolutionary synthesis models ( c.f .",
    "leitherer & heckman 1995 ; leitherer et al .",
    "1999 ) and they estimate that the energy injection rate in ngc5253 is @xmath99 for both instantaneous burst and continuous star - formation models , and we shall adopt this figure hereafter . the mass injection rate from the _ starburst99 _ models for this level of mechanical luminosity will be @xmath100 depending on whether instantaneous or continuous starburst models are assumed ( for an age of 5  myr ) .",
    "an estimate of the ambient density in the central regions , @xmath97 , can be made based on the hi observations of kobulnicky & skillman ( 1995 ) .",
    "the peak hi column density in the central regions is @xmath101  @xmath28 which , assuming that the path length is @xmath64kpc ( i.e comparable to the beam width ) leads to @xmath102  @xmath9 .",
    "we note that martin ( 1997 ) inferred densities of @xmath103  @xmath9 in the warm photoionised gas in the core of ngc5253 , though with a filling factor of a percent or so , and that much higher densities are also implied for the smaller volumes associated with the hii regions in ngc5253 ( turner et al.1998 ) .    using these figures in equations 1 and 2 give values for @xmath89 and @xmath90 of 570  pc and @xmath104 .",
    "the size estimate is comparable to the size of the region occupied by the bulk of the x - ray and h@xmath2 emitting gases , but no allowance has been made for the effect of the interaction of outflows from the multiple star - clusters present in the central region , while the theory is applicable to the growth of a single bubble .",
    "this size estimate is smaller than the size of the reported large - scale h@xmath2 shells , their expansion velocities were measured to be @xmath78 , which is of roughly the same order as predicted here .",
    "it is possible that we may be observing the escape of some stellar wind material through ruptures in the original bubble that are then proceeding to sweep - up and shock more of the ism lying outside the central region .",
    "the emission from such gas has to be at a very low intensity though as it is not detected by either _",
    "chandra _ or _ xmm - newton_. the average count rate in the annuli beyond the 0.53  kpc to which the x - ray emission can be traced is @xmath105  cts  s@xmath106 , which corresponds to a flux of @xmath107  @xmath28 .",
    "alternatively , a clumpy environment could allow preferential escape along channels between molecular clouds , although there does not appear to be evidence for the existence of such objects , and the low expansion velocities observed would argue against such uninhibited outflow .",
    "there are however two ` dark clouds ' reported in the west of the galaxy by hunter ( 1982 ) .",
    "the superbubble model allows prediction of the x - ray luminosity of an expanding bubble to be made . from table  7",
    ", it can be seen that the radiative cooling time for both components of the x - ray emitting gas is long compared to our assumed expansion time of 5  myr , and so radiative losses can be assumed to be small .",
    "assuming spherical symmetry for the expansion , uniform density for the ambient ism and a constant rate of kinetic energy injection , the x - ray luminosity is given by    @xmath108    where @xmath109 is the volume emissivity of the gas being considered .",
    "based on the density @xmath110 and temperature @xmath111 profiles ( chu & mac low 1990 ) , this equation can be evaluated to yield the x - ray luminosity of the superbubble .",
    "assuming an emissivity of the x - ray emitting gas of @xmath112  @xmath113 ( cf table  7 ) , we find that for ngc5253    @xmath114    as discussed earlier , assuming an energy injection rate from the starburst in ngc5253 of @xmath99 , an ambient density of @xmath102  @xmath9 and an age of 5  myr , leads to a predicted thermal x - ray luminosity for ngc5253 of @xmath115 , which is lower than that observed for the two thermal components ( @xmath116 , but given the uncertainties in the some of the assumed parameters , and indeed the validity of treating the situation in ngc5253 as a single superbubble , this is perhaps reasonable agreement .",
    "we note that an estimate of the mechanical energy injection rate can also be obtained from the thermal energy contained within the diffuse x - ray emission . averaging the values obtained from the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ data , the total thermal energy is @xmath117  erg . assuming this is the result of complete thermalization of the stellar winds for the duration of the current starburst ,",
    "then @xmath98 is @xmath118 , which is again in broad agreement with that from theoretical considerations of the starburst stellar population .",
    "the total mass of material contained in the x - ray emitting gas obtained from the average figures of the two data sets is @xmath119 ( ignoring the filling factor ) .",
    "if this mass has been injected during the lifetime of the starburst then the mass injection rate is on average @xmath120 .",
    "another estimate of the mass injection rate can be obtained from the fact that for an adiabatic superbubble , the x - ray temperature @xmath121 , where    @xmath122    ( heckman et al .",
    "1995 ) and is the temperature attained if all the mechanical energy injected by the starburst remains entirely within the shocked wind region .",
    "the weighted average temperature of the diffuse x - ray emitting gas ( table  7 ) is @xmath123  k , which gives a value for @xmath124  k and from the assumed @xmath98 , a mass injection rate of @xmath125 .",
    "finally , an estimate of the deposited mass from both the stellar winds and conductive evaporation of the swept - up ism material can be made from the density of the diffuse x - ray emitting gas .",
    "this figure depends on the filling factor of the bubble interior but assuming @xmath126 results in an upper limit .",
    "further , it is necessary to assume that any volume occupied by the swept - up cool shell of ism and the freely expanding stellar winds is small in comparison to the shocked wind region . with the combined density of the soft and medium components , @xmath127  @xmath9 , @xmath128  @xmath113 and all other symbols having their usual meanings ,    @xmath129    which implies a mass injection rate of @xmath130 over 5  myr .",
    "the mass injection rates into the hot phase derived here from the x - ray observations are thus either slightly above or broadly comparable to the current star - formation rate ( @xmath131 ) derived from infrared and h@xmath2 luminosities ( table  1 ) , but rather higher than the current stellar mass - injection rates .",
    "the mass deposition rate into the hot - phase seen here suggests that if the outflow from the starburst region develops into a superwind and escapes the gravitational potential well of the galaxy then there is substantial scope for both metal - enrichment of , and deposition of large amounts of mass and energy into the igm .",
    "the likelihood of blow - out occurring can be assessed by applying the criterion for blow - out , defined by mac low & mccray ( 1988 ) to ngc5253 .",
    "this defines a parameter @xmath132 , the dimensionless rate of kinetic energy injection , and predicts blow - out if @xmath133 , with @xmath132 given by    @xmath134    where @xmath135 is the mechanical energy luminosity in units of @xmath94 , @xmath136 is the galaxy scale - height in kpc , and @xmath137 is the initial pressure of the ism in units of @xmath138  k  @xmath9 . for @xmath139 , with @xmath140 , @xmath141  @xmath9 and assuming @xmath142 ( typical of the value in the milky way ) , then @xmath143",
    ". the hi halo of ngc5253 extends to around twice the optical extent @xmath144 ( @xmath145  kpc ) along the minor axis of the galaxy ( kobulnicky & skillman 1995 ) .",
    "it seems extremely likely then that the hot , metal - enriched gas generated by the current starburst along with the swept - up and conductively evaporated ism material can escape the gravitational potential well of ngc5253 .",
    "in summary , we have presented an x - ray analysis of the important dwarf elliptical , starburst galaxy ngc5253 using data from both the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ satellites .",
    "we detected x - ray emission from 31 discrete point sources in the _ chandra _ acis - s3 chip data with 17 of these lying within the optical extent of the galaxy , as measured by the @xmath70 ellipse .",
    "some of these can be clearly identified as x - ray binaries while others seem to be associated with the emission from super star - clusters rather than individual point sources , as they are extended compared to the _ chandra _ psf .",
    "the 5 sources in this category ( sources @xmath146 ) all lie in the central region of the galaxy and are associated ( particularly in the case of sources 17 , 18 and 19 ) with the most intense regions of emission seen on the h@xmath2 image .",
    "the unabsorbed luminosities of these sources in the @xmath147 energy band , range from @xmath148 .",
    "the majority of the x - ray emission is confined to the central region of the galaxy where the intense , current burst of star - formation is occurring .",
    "the extent of the emission also correlates well with that of the h@xmath2 emission and both are confined to a region of diameter @xmath64  kpc in the centre of the galaxy .",
    "both of these emissions are embedded within a spherical distribution of hi that extends out to @xmath149  kpc from the centre .",
    "the diffuse x - ray emission in ngc5253 requires two thermal and one power - law component to best fit its spectrum , suggesting that the hot gas is a multi - phase environment with unresolved point sources , probably lower luminosity x - ray binaries , embedded in it .",
    "the fitted gas temperatures are @xmath150 and @xmath151 for the soft and medium components respectively and their respective absorption corrected luminosities in the @xmath152 band are @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "this emission is seen to be extended in several directions in the _ chandra _ data but this is not confirmed by the _ xmm - newton _ data .",
    "however , the extent is not as great as the @xmath64  kpc shells reported to the nw and wsw by marlowe et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , in the h@xmath2 emission .",
    "these shells are expanding with velocities of @xmath78 and hence have required @xmath1610  myr to have evolved .",
    "ngc5253 is proving to be a rather enigmatic object though , as our analysis of the dynamics of the hot gas are not consistent with the expansion velocity and age of these h@xmath2 shells .",
    "the hot x - ray emitting gas has a total thermal energy content of @xmath155  erg and a total mass of @xmath156 . from values in the literature , we assume an age for the starburst responsible for this hot gas of 5  myr and a value for the density of the ambient ism of @xmath157  @xmath9 .",
    "the radius of the region in which most of the diffuse x - ray and h@xmath2 emission is confined is @xmath158  kpc .",
    "application of standard superbubble models to ngc5253 s starburst , assuming the age and density above , result in a predicted radius and expansion velocity for a single superbubble of @xmath159  pc and @xmath160 , figures which are comparable to those observed .",
    "the main problem here would seem to lie in the fact that no clear bipolar outflow is observed in ngc5253 and no allowance has been made for the presence of multiple superbubbles in the central region . if the central starburst is young , the bubbles blown around individual star clusters will overlap and impede each others expansion confining the emission to a smaller region than expected and reducing the observed expansion rate .",
    "the h@xmath2 shells , reported by marlowe et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , to the west could be the result of the superbubbles closest to the edge of the central region being able to expand more freely .",
    "the lower velocity seen could result from less stars contributing to the energy input in these regions and/or the outflow having experienced some recent deceleration on encountering higher density material such as the dark clouds reported in the west of the galaxy ( hunter 1982 ) .",
    "however , our radial surface brightness profile does not show any detectable x - ray emission beyond @xmath76  kpc .",
    "ngc5253 is a very complex object , which shows that standard superbubble models are difficult to apply to dwarf starbursts galaxies .",
    "however , the energy injection rate into the galaxy would seem sufficient to allow the expanding hot gas to escape the gravitational potential well of ngc5253 and its relatively small ( @xmath161  kpc along the minor axis ) hi halo would also offer little resistance to this .",
    "thus , it seems likely then that ngc5253 will lose metal - enriched material , mass and energy as a result of its current bout of star - formation .",
