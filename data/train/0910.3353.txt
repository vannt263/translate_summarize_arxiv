    "the search for a mechanism for electroweak symmetry breaking , and in particular for a standard model ( sm ) higgs boson has been a major goal of particle physics for many years , and is a central part of the fermilab tevatron physics program .",
    "both the cdf and experiments are reporting new combinations  @xcite of multiple direct searches for the sm higgs boson .",
    "the new searches include more data and improved analysis techniques compared to previous analyses .",
    "the sensitivities of these new combinations significantly exceed previous work  @xcite .",
    "the most recent tevatron higgs combination  @xcite only included channels seeking higgs bosons of masses between 155 and 200  gev/@xmath11 , and the most recent combination over the entire mass range 100 - 200  gev/@xmath11 was reported in april 2008  @xcite .    in this note",
    ", we combine the most recent results of all such searches in  collisions at  .",
    "the analyses combined here seek signals of higgs bosons produced in associated with vector bosons ( @xmath12 ) , through gluon - gluon fusion ( @xmath13 ) , and through vector boson fusion ( vbf ) ( @xmath14 ) corresponding to integrated luminosities ranging from 2.0 - 3.6  at cdf and 0.9 - 4.2  at d .",
    "the higgs boson decay modes studied are @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .    to simplify the combination , the searches are separated into 75 mutually exclusive final states ( 23 for cdf and 52 for d ; see table  [ tab : cdfacc ] and  [ tab : dzacc ] ) referred to as `` analyses '' in this note .",
    "the selection procedures for each analysis are detailed in refs .",
    "@xcite through  @xcite , and are briefly described below .",

    "event selections are similar for the corresponding cdf and d  analyses . for the case of ,",
    "an isolated lepton ( @xmath20 electron or muon ) and two jets are required , with one or more @xmath21-tagged jet , i.e. , identified as containing a weakly - decaying @xmath22 hadron .",
    "selected events must also display a significant imbalance in transverse momentum ( referred to as missing transverse energy or ) .",
    "events with more than one isolated lepton are vetoed . for the d  analyses ,",
    "two and three jet events are analyzed separately , and in each of these samples two non - overlapping @xmath21-tagged samples are defined , one being a single `` tight '' @xmath21-tag ( st ) sample , and the other a double `` loose '' @xmath21-tag ( dt ) sample .",
    "the tight and loose @xmath21-tagging criteria are defined with respect to the mis - identification rate that the @xmath21-tagging algorithm yields for light quark or gluon jets ( `` mistag rate '' ) typically @xmath23 or @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "the final variable is a neural network output which takes as input seven kinematics variables and a matrix element discriminant for the 2 jet sample , while for the 3 jet sample the dijet invariant mass is used . in this combination ,",
    "we add a new analysis  in which the @xmath25 is identified through its hadronic decays .",
    "this analysis is sensitive to @xmath26 as well in those cases where a @xmath25 fails to be identified .",
    "the analysis is carried out according to the type of reconstructed @xmath25 and is also separated into two and three jets with dt events only .",
    "it uses the dijet invariant mass of the @xmath27 system as discriminant variable .    for the cdf  analyses ,",
    "the events are grouped into six categories .",
    "in addition to the selections requiring an identified lepton , events with an isolated track failing lepton selection requirements are grouped into their own categories .",
    "this provides some acceptance for single prong tau decays . within the lepton categories there are three @xmath21-tagging categories",
    " two tight @xmath21-tags ( tdt ) , one tight @xmath21-tag and one loose @xmath21-tag ( ldt ) , and a single , tight , @xmath21-tag ( st ) .",
    "in each category , two discriminants are calculated for each event .",
    "one neural network discriminant is trained at each @xmath28 in the test range , separately for each category .",
    "a second discriminant is a boosted decision tree , featuring not only event kinematic and @xmath21-tagging observables , but matrix element discriminants as well .",
    "these two discriminants are then combined together using an evolutionary neural network  @xcite to form a single discriminant with optimal performance .    for the  analyses ,",
    "the selection is similar to the @xmath29 selection , except all events with isolated leptons are vetoed and stronger multijet background suppression techniques are applied .",
    "both cdf and d   analyses use a track - based missing transverse momentum calculation as a discriminant against false .",
    "there is a sizable fraction of  signal in which the lepton is undetected , that is selected in the  samples , so these analyses are also refered to as @xmath30 .",
    "the cdf analysis uses three non - overlapping samples of events ( tdt , ldt and st as for @xmath29 ) while duses a sample of events having one tight @xmath21-tag jet and one loose @xmath21-tag jet .",
    "cdf used neural - network discriminants as the final variables , while d   uses boosted decision trees as advanced analysis technique .",
    "the  analyses require two isolated leptons and at least two jets .",
    "they use non - overlapping samples of events with one tight @xmath21-tag and two loose @xmath21-tags . for the d  analysis neural - network and boosted decision trees discriminants are the final variables for setting limits ( depending on the sub - channel ) , while cdf uses the output of a 2-dimensional neural - network .",
    "cdf corrects jet energies for  using a neural network approach . in this analysis",
    "also the events are divided into three tagging categories : tight double tags , loose double tags , and single tags .    for the  analyses ,",
    "signal events are characterized by a large  and two opposite - signed , isolated leptons .",
    "the presence of neutrinos in the final state prevents the reconstruction of the candidate higgs boson mass .",
    "d  selects events containing electrons and muons , dividing the data sample into three final states : @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 .",
    "cdf separates the  events in five non - overlapping samples , labeled `` high @xmath34 '' and `` low @xmath34 '' for the lepton selection categories , and also split by the number of jets : 0 , 1 , or 2 + jets . the sample with two or more jets is not split into low @xmath34 and high @xmath34 lepton categories .",
    "the division of events into jet categories allows the analysis discriminants to separate three different categories of signals from the backgrounds more effectively .",
    "the signal production mechanisms considered are @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and the vector - boson fusion process .",
    "the final discriminants are neural - network outputs for d and neural - network output including likelihoods constructed from matrix - element probabilities ( me ) as input to the neural network , for cdf , in the 0-jet bin , else the me are not used .",
    "all analyses in this channel have been updated with more data and analysis improvements .",
    "the cdf collaboration also contributes an analysis searching for higgs bosons decaying to a tau lepton pair , in three separate production channels : direct @xmath37 production , associated @xmath29 or @xmath38 production , or vector boson production with @xmath0 and forward jets in the final state . in this analysis ,",
    "the final variable for setting limits is a combination of several neural - network discriminants .",
    "d  also contributes a new analysis for the final state @xmath39 jet jet , which is sensitive to the @xmath40 , @xmath41 , vbf and gluon gluon fusion ( with two additional jets ) mechanisms .",
    "it uses a neural network output as discriminant variable .",
    "the cdf collaboration introduces a new all - hadronic channel , @xmath42 for this combination .",
    "events are selected with four jets , at least two of which are @xmath21-tagged with the tight @xmath21-tagger .",
    "the large qcd backgrounds are estimated with the use of data control samples , and the final variable is a matrix element signal probability discriminant .",
    "the d  collaboration contributes three  analyses , where the associated @xmath43 boson and the @xmath43 boson from the higgs boson decay which has the same charge are required to decay leptonically , thereby defining three like - sign dilepton final states ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 ) containing all decays of the third @xmath43 boson . in this analysis , which has not been updated for this combination ,",
    "the final variable is a likelihood discriminant formed from several topological variables .",
    "cdf contributes a  analysis using a selection of like - sign dileptons and a neural network to further purify the signal .",
    "d  also contributes an analysis searching for direct higgs boson production decaying to a photon pair in 4.2 fb@xmath47 of data . in this analysis ,",
    "the final variable is the invariant mass of the two - photon system .",
    "another new search from d  is included in this combination , namely the search for @xmath48 . here",
    "the samples are analyzed independently according to the number of @xmath21-tagged jets ( 1,2,3 , i.e. st , dt , tt ) and the total number of jets ( 4 or 5 ) .",
    "the total transverse energy of the reconstructed objects ( @xmath49 ) is used as discriminant variable .",
    "all higgs boson signals are simulated using pythia  @xcite , and cteq5l or cteq6l  @xcite leading - order ( lo ) parton distribution functions .",
    "the @xmath13 production cross section is calculated at nnll in qcd and also includes two - loop electroweak effects ; see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein for the different steps of these calculations .",
    "the newer calculation includes a more thorough treatment of higher - order radiative corrections , particularly those involving @xmath21 quark loops .",
    "the @xmath13 production cross section depends strongly on the pdf set chosen and the accompanying value of @xmath50 .",
    "the cross sections used here are calculated with the mstw 2008 nnlo pdf set  @xcite .",
    "the new @xmath13 cross sections supersede those used in the update of summer 2008  @xcite , which had a simpler treatment of radiative corrections and used the older mrst 2002 pdf set  @xcite .",
    "the higgs boson production cross sections used here are listed in  @xcite ( originally from  @xcite ) .",
    "we include all significant higgs production modes in the high mass search : besides gluon - gluon fusion through a virtual top quark loop ( ggh ) , we include production in association with a @xmath43 or @xmath51 vector boson ( vh )  @xcite , and vector boson fusion ( vbf )  @xcite .    the higgs boson decay branching ratio predictions are calculated with hdecay  @xcite . for both cdf and d , events from multijet ( instrumental ) backgrounds ( `` qcd production '' ) are measured in data with different methods , in orthogonal samples . for cdf ,",
    "backgrounds from other sm processes were generated using pythia , alpgen  @xcite , mc@nlo  @xcite and herwig  @xcite programs .",
    "for d , these backgrounds were generated using pythia , alpgen , and comphep  @xcite , with pythia providing parton - showering and hadronization for all the generators .",
    "these background processes were normalized using either experimental data or next - to - leading order calculations ( from mcfm  @xcite for @xmath52 heavy flavor process ) .",
    "integrated luminosities , and references to the collaborations public documentation for each analysis are given in table  [ tab : cdfacc ] for cdf and in table  [ tab : dzacc ] for d .",
    "the tables include the ranges of higgs boson mass ( @xmath28 ) over which the searches were performed .",
    "the number of channels combined is quite large , and the number of bins in each channel is large .",
    "therefore , the task of assembling histograms and checking whether the expected and observed limits are consistent with the input predictions and observed data is difficult .",
    "we therefore provide histograms that aggregate all channels signal , background , and data together . in order to preserve most of the sensitivity gain that is achieved by the analyses by binning the data instead of collecting them all together and counting , we aggregate the data and predictions in narrow bins of signal - to - background ratio , @xmath34",
    ". data with similar @xmath34 may be added together with no loss in sensitivity , assuming similar systematic errors on the predictions .",
    "the aggregate histograms do not show the effects of systematic uncertainties , but instead compare the data with the central predictions supplied by each analysis .",

    "to gain confidence that the final result does not depend on the details of the statistical formulation , we perform two types of combinations , using the bayesian and modified frequentist approaches , which give similar results ( within 10% ) . both methods rely on distributions in the final discriminants , and not just on their single integrated values .",
