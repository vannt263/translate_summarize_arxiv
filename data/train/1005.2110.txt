    "the ads / cft correspondence affords us a means of studying the behavior of gauge theory fluids at strong coupling in terms of gravity duals in a space of one extra dimension .",

    "this black hole is dual to a gauge theory plasma residing on the conformal boundary via holographic renormalization @xcite . to see this ,",

    "following a suggestion by bjorken @xcite , in order to understand the quark gluon plasma produced in heavy ion collisions , one needs to study boost invariant hydrodynamics .",
    "this is because there is a `` plateau '' in particle production in the central rapidity region .",
    "the emergent nuclei are highly lorentz - contracted pancakes receding at speed of light , resulting in a flow which is independent of the lorentz frame ( boost invariant ) . given appropriate initial conditions ( see table [ table1 ] for rhic and the lhc ) ,    .[table1]initial conditions for the quark gluon plasma at rhic and the lhc [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the hydrodynamic equations respect their symmetry ( boost invariance ) and lead to simple solutions . for a conformal fluid , one obtains ~^-4/3  ,  t ~^-1/3  ,  s ~^-1 where @xmath15 is the longitudinal proper time defined in ( [ eq11 ] ) .",
    "suppose that the plasma lives on a @xmath16-dimensional minkowski space spanned by coordinates @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) and the colliding beams are along the @xmath19 direction .",
    "introducing coordinates @xmath20 ( proper time and rapidity in the longitudinal plane , respectively ) [ eq11 ] x^0=y  ,  x^1=y the minkowski metric reads [ eq16 ] ds^2=dx_dx^= -d^2+^2 dy^2+(dx^)^2 where @xmath21 are the transverse coordinates .",

    "one may similarly find the time dependence of viscosity corrections . at high temperatures",
    "one expects that the ratio @xmath26 asymptotes to a constant .",
    "therefore , @xmath27 t = t_0  ,  s = s_0 for the gravity dual of bjorken flow , a solution of the einstein equations was constructed @xcite as a series expansion in large longitudinal time keeping the parameter v = z^-1/(d-2 ) fixed . at leading order",
    "the metric that leads to boost invariant hydrodynamics reads [ metric ] ds^2 _ = higher - order corrections can be systematically calculated and lead to the ratio [ eq44 ] = as with sinusoidal perturbations of black holes @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the above asymptotic expression ( [ metric ] ) for the metric can also be obtained from a static schwarzschild black hole as follows @xcite . instead of approaching the conformal boundary with @xmath28  const .",

    "applying the transformation ( [ eq23 ] ) to the exact black hole metric ( [ eqmebh ] ) , or more precisely , to a patch which includes the boundary @xmath29 , one obtains ds^2 _ = +  which matches the bulk metric of bjorken flow ( [ metric ] ) to leading order in @xmath32 with fixed @xmath33 . thus , one obtains bjorken hydrodynamics asymptotically ( as @xmath34 ) from a static black hole !",
    "higher - order corrections to bjorken flow dictated by the black hole may be found by refining the transformation @xcite .",
    "this entails introducing corrections which are of @xmath35 and making sure that the application of the transformation to the black hole metric does not introduce dependence of the metric on the rapidity and the transverse coordinates .",
    "it can be done systematically at each order in the @xmath32 expansion . however , at higher orders , to maintain boost invariance on the boundary , one must perturb the schwarzschild metric .",
    "this perturbation leads to the ratio ( [ eq44 ] ) @xcite in agreement with the time - dependent asymptotic solution of einstein equations .",
    "in a popular scenario for cosmology , our universe is modeled by a 3-brane embedded in a higher - dimensional bulk .",
    "the cosmological evolution of the brane is equivalent to its motion within the bulk space .",
    "the bulk may be occupied by a black hole , or a more complicated ( or unknown ) solution to the einstein equations ( allowing for energy exchange between the brane and the bulk ) .",
    "my goal is to understand how the cosmological evolution emerges in the context of the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "i shall show that the equations of cosmological evolution emerge via holographic renormalization , even when one starts from a static ads schwarzschild black hole , provided the boundary conditions are chosen appropriately @xcite .",
    "i shall concentrate on the case of a five - dimensional bulk @xmath36 with a physically relevant four - dimensional conformal boundary @xmath37 .",
    "one usually fixes the geometry of the conformal boundary by adopting dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "however , for cosmological evolution the boundary geometry must remain dynamical .",
    "this may lead to fluctuations of the bulk metric which are not normalizable , but such fears are unfounded : the boundary geometry can be dynamical if one correctly introduces boundary counterterms needed in order to cancel infinities @xcite .",
    "the einstein field equations are obtained by varying the bulk action @xmath38 which consists of the five - dimensional einstein - hilbert action on @xmath36 with a cosmological term , the gibbons - hawking boundary term and boundary counterterms needed to render the system finite .",

    "the two quantities agree for flat horizons ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "the additional piece is due to a change of the vacuum state from minkowski to the conformal vacuum ( curved metrics can be conformally mapped on minkowski space ) .",
