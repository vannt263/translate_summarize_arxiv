    "with _ hubble space telescope _ the central surface brightness profiles of nearby galaxies can be studied with a resolution limit of @xmath1 , which corresponds to , e.g. , @xmath2 parsecs in virgo .",
    "so , a large number of early type galaxies have been observed with unprecedented detail in their central regions ( e.g. , jaffe et al .",
    "1994 , ferrarese et al .",
    "1994 , lauer et al .",
    "1995 , forbes et al . 1995 ; faber et al .",
    "1997 , hereafter f97 ) .",
    "it turns out that the most luminous galaxies show outer power law profiles that break internally to shallow inner profiles @xmath3 , with @xmath4 .",
    "these galaxies are said to have cuspy cores ; their break radii typically range from 50 to 1000 pc .",
    "faint galaxies show instead steep featureless power law profiles that lack cores down to the resolution limit .",
    "their central surface brightness slope is typically @xmath5 , with @xmath6 on average . at intermediate luminosities core and",
    "power law galaxies coexist .",
    "these central properties correlate with isophotal shape and amount of rotation : core galaxies tend to be boxy and slowly rotating , whereas power law galaxies tend to be disky and rapidly rotating ( f97 ) . at intermediate luminosities , where power law and core galaxies coexist , the presence of a core is a better predictor of boxiness or slow rotation than luminosity ; the same can be said for the absence of a core and diskiness , or high rotation .",
    "so , it has been suggested that early type galaxies can be divided into two families : one includes those galaxies that are coreless , nearly isotropic spheroids , rotate rapidly , and have disky isophotes ; the other those that have cores , rotate slowly , are possibly moderately triaxial and boxy - distorted ( kormendy & bender 1996 ) .    in this paper",
    "i investigate whether power law and core early type galaxies ( ellipticals and s0s ) differ systematically also in their soft x - ray luminosities .",
    "i find that power law galaxies are confined below log @xmath7(erg s@xmath8 , while core ones can reach values at least one order of magnitude higher .",
    "this holds even in the range of optical luminosities where the two families coexist .",
    "so , the central properties of early type galaxies are tightly related to , and possibly at the origin of , their global x - ray emission . a key factor could be the presence of a central massive black hole .",
    "in fact , it has been suggested that nuclear massive black holes are important for explaining the dicothomy of the inner light profiles , as they should have substantial influence on the dynamics and evolution of the surrounding gas and stars ( e.g. , cipollina & bertin 1994 , van der marel 1999 , merritt 1999 , nakano & makino 1999 ) .",
    "i also explore the alternative possibility that the other basic properties characterizing the two families ( importance of rotation and isophotal shape distortion ) affect the global .",
    "this hypothesis is less plausible because the trend of @xmath7 with these other properties is less sharp .",
    "finally , i also examine the effects on that may be produced by differences in the environment .",
    "f97 present the fits of the surface brightness profiles for a large sample of early type galaxies observed with wfpc1 ; they modeled the data with a double power law with a break radius , derived the inner surface brightness slope ( the @xmath9 parameter ) and gave the classification into core or power law galaxy accordingly .",
    "this classification is given by the same authors for nine more early type galaxies in magorrian et al .",
    "crane et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , ferrarese et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , forbes et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and quillen et al .",
    "( 1999 ) also present _ hst _ central profiles for a number of early type galaxies , and fit them with double power laws which govern the inner and the outer slopes . for all these galaxies , following f97 , i have adopted the criterion of classifying them as power law galaxies when the central brightness profile does not show an inner break , and as core galaxies when it does . in the first case the inner slope always turned out to be larger than 0.3 , and in the second case smaller than 0.3 .",
    "i have cross - correlated the sample of es and s0s with inner profile measured by _ hst _ with existing catalogs of x - ray emission , namely the _",
    "einstein _ based catalog ( fabbiano et al . 1992 ) , the @xmath10 all - sky survey based catalog ( beuing et al .",
    "1999 ) , and the list of 61 early type galaxies observed with the @xmath10 pspc by irwin & sarazin ( 1998 ) .",
    "so , i have collected a sample of 59 galaxies with information on both the x - ray emission ( detection or upper limit ) and the central surface brightness properties erg s@xmath11 ) is known to be largely contaminated by the presence of a ` classical ' agn , while in the present study only normal early type galaxies are considered ( see also section 5.2 ) .",
    "all these three galaxies have cores . ] .",

    "not surprisingly , the behavior of the x - ray emission with respect to the shape of the central brightness profile is reminiscent of the trend of with respect to the other basic properties characterizing early type galaxies , already mentioned in section 1 : one is the deviation of the isophotal shape from a pure elliptical shape , and is described by the @xmath29 parameter introduced by bender et al .",

    ", i consider here in detail the @xmath9 and the @xmath29 relations ( fig . 2 ; @xmath29 has been measured for 47 of the galaxies in table 1 ) .",
    "while the @xmath41 relation shows clearly a dicothomy in the x - ray properties , the @xmath29 relation looks like a wedge , because not all disky galaxies are low x - ray emitters .",
    "there are in fact both power law and core galaxies ( i.e. , x - ray faint and x - ray bright objects ) for @xmath60 .",
    "this fact is explained by an inspection of fig .",
    "3 , that is another version of fig . 1 where disky and boxy galaxies are plotted with different symbols : disky and boxy objects are more mixed in the relation than core and power law galaxies .",
    "so , figs . 2 and 3",
    "show that _ all _ power law galaxies have log @xmath21 , while the same is not true for galaxies with disky isophotes .",
    "one concludes that a _ global _ property such as , such as the inner profile shape , and more so than with other characterizing galaxy properties as the isophotal shape .",
    "this occurs in spite of the fact that there are more objects in the @xmath41 plot than in the @xmath29 one ; an effect of `` blurring '' , because a larger sample is considered , is expected to affect the @xmath41 plot more than the @xmath29 one .",
    "it must be noted that the absence of a sharp transition in the @xmath29 relation might be produced , at least in part , by the uncertainties associated with the definition of @xmath61 . in fact , the @xmath61 values given in table 1 refer to an average between 10 and 60 arcsec , i.e. , between typically 0.2 and 1 optical effective radius , where the shape of the isophotes is known to vary within the same galaxy , sometimes also significantly ( e.g. , van den bosch et al .",
    "the results obtained here indicate that the two families of early type galaxies recently singled out have also a distinct x - ray behavior in the ( 0.22 ) kev band .",
    "the trend between and the shape of the central profile is similar to the trends between and the isophotal shape distortion , or the degree of rotational support .",
    "however , it is much sharper than the other two , and it could be at the origin of the difference in the x - ray properties .    what are the possible causes of this segregation of power law galaxies to @xmath21 , and",
    "how do core ones evade it ?",
    "can the change in the shape of the density profile in the central regions be responsible for such a disparate behavior of ? or are some other galaxy properties , to which the change in the shape of the surface brightness profile is linked , responsible for this difference ?",
    "for example , besides isophotal shape and rotation , distinct evolutions , where an important role is played also by massive black holes , could be responsible for the settling of the two types of profiles ( section 1 ) and also have an effect on .    in the following i speculate on a few conceivable causes of the different behavior in the two families of early type galaxies .",
    "i will focus first on the direct effect of the inner profile shape on ; then on that of a massive black hole ( mbh ) ; finally on those expected from possible differences in the environment .",
    "i assume that the scatter in is related to a largely varying quantity of hot gas within galaxies , as demonstrated observationally by considering their spectral properties ( e.g. , matsumoto et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "ciotti et al .",
    "( 1991 ) simulated the evolution of the hot gas behavior over the galaxy lifetime for spherical mass distributions having king profiles ( i.e. , with flat cores ) , including type ia supernova heating .",
    "they showed that the large range observed at fixed can be produced by small differences in the gravitational potential energy of the gas , which cause the gas flows to be in the wind , outflow or inflow stages .",
    "later pellegrini & ciotti ( 1998 ) produced a set of hydrodynamical simulations where the spatial luminosity distribution at small radii has a power law form ( @xmath62 as in the jaffe law ; this corresponds to the central luminosity density profile of power law galaxies , gebhardt et al .",
    "the resulting gas flows are mostly partial winds : an inflow develops in the central region , while the external parts are still degassing . a large spread in at fixed is again produced by varying the model input parameters in their observed ranges , and corresponds to variations in the size of the inflow region . in particular , for @xmath63log @xmath64",
    ", values as high as @xmath65 erg s@xmath11 can be easily reached .",
    "so , in the x - ray luminosity values of a large sample of galaxies there should be no trace of the precise shape of the mass profile in the very central regions .",
    "this is supported also by the observations that show how all power law galaxies have low independently of the @xmath9 values ( fig .",
    "2 ) , while core galaxies have a large range of with little variation of @xmath9 .",
    "galactic rotation is an important property of power law galaxies ( section 1 ) , and so one might suspect that the simulations mentioned above are not realistic for these galaxies",
    ". however , as shown by ciotti & pellegrini ( 1996 ) and by dercole & ciotti ( 1998 ) with simulations , rotation has minor effects on . if no type ia supernova s heating is assumed ( so that the flows are always cooling flows ) the effect is larger : a reduction of by a factor of six is obtained when @xmath66 , and a very massive cold disk forms ( of mass @xmath67 ; brighenti & mathews 1996 ) . even though in this case the effect of rotation goes in the right direction , the observations can not be fully explained , because the needed reduction in is at least of one order of magnitude .",
    "moreover , for @xmath68 there are both power law and x - ray bright core galaxies ( see fig .",
    "4 ) , and so the amount of rotation can not be taken as the general explanation .    -5truecm -1truecm -1truecm    a flatter global galaxy shape is another property known to be associated on average to lower values , from observations ( eskridge et al .",
    "the hot gas is less bound when the mass distribution is flatter , for fixed , so that an outflow is favoured ( dercole & ciotti 1998 ) .",
    "this is the case of galaxies where a disk is present , and might apply preferentially to power law galaxies .",
    "those in the present sample , for log @xmath69 , include four s0s , but also three roundish ( e0-e2 ) galaxies .",
    "so , again the presence of a disk has an effect that goes in the right direction , but can not be taken as a general explanation ( unless all the above mentioned power law galaxies with rounder shape turned out to be disk galaxies viewed face on ) .    in conclusion ,",
    "large systematic variations of the hot gas content resulting from differences of the inner profile shape are not expected , based on numerical simulations ; galactic rotation and flattening of the mass distribution are expected to have an effect , but seem to be unable to offer a general explanation .",
    "this is consistent with the @xmath41 relation being sharper than the @xmath59 one ( and the @xmath70 one , where @xmath71 is the projected galaxy ellipticity , pellegrini et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "when dealing with properties connected with the very central regions of early type galaxies , one is naturally brought to consider the effects produced by a central mbh . in fact , on the basis of various kinds of observational evidence , in the past few years it has become commonly accepted that early type galaxies host central massive black holes , possibly remnants of dead or quiescent qsos ( kormendy & richstone 1995 , richstone et al . 1998 ) . why the x - ray emission in early type galaxies is not as high as in classical agns , due to accretion of hot gas by the central mbh ,",
    "is a problem that has been addressed by binney & tabor ( 1995 ) , fabian & rees ( 1995 ) and by ciotti & ostriker ( 1997 ) .",
    "fabian & rees suggest that accretion of gas from the surrounding cooling flow has a very low radiative efficiency , and that early type galaxies should typically host low or very low luminosity agns .",
    "ciotti & ostriker suggest that the hot gas can be expelled from the galaxies when a central mbh is present , because the gas flows are found to be unstable due to compton heating .",
    "so , most of the time the galaxies are in a low or medium state , they are in a high state only during global inflows , and the large observed scatter in is reproduced .    in both frameworks",
    "it is not clear why power law galaxies are found _ only _ in the low or medium state , while core galaxies span the whole observed scatter in .",
    "a few solutions , where other ingredients besides the presence of a mbh enter , can be imagined : the shape of the galaxies ( triaxial versus axisymmetric ) can have an effect on the way accretion proceeds . or the very mbh properties ( such as its mass ) could play a role . in any case if a mbh is important in determining , the conventional approach to the problem of interpreting the x - ray properties of early type galaxies requires revision ; the input ingredients are currently just stellar mass loss , supernova heating , and gas potential energy ( see , e.g. , sarazin & white 1988 , david et al .",
    "1990 , ciotti et al .",
    "more precisely , since a different amount of hot gas is at the origin of the observed large scatter in at fixed ( e.g. , matusmoto et al .",
    "1997 ) , one should focus on the relation between central mbh presence and amount of hot gas .",
    "f97 present a preliminary evidence that core galaxies tend to be found in dense groups and clusters , while power law ones are preferentially found in the field .",
    "this is in line with the fact that core galaxies are on average also boxy / irregular ( which has been argued to be a merger signature , or a sign of past accretion and interaction events ; nieto 1989 , barnes 1992 ) and show more frequently indications of accretion of small satellites such as cores within cores , central counter - rotation , etc .",
    "( lauer et al . 1995 ) . in this scenario , what could be the effects on ? more generally , what is the effect of the environment on the hot gas content ?",
    "an environment denser of intragroup / intracluster gas and of galaxies should act in the sense of producing both extremely x - ray luminous galaxies and galaxies with medium or low .",
    "in fact accretion of external gas is needed to explain the x - ray brightest galaxies of the diagram ( renzini et al .",
    "1993 , mathews & brighenti 1998 ) while in the x - ray faint ones the hot gaseous halos could have been stripped by ambient gas , if it is sufficiently dense , or in encounters with other galaxies ( white & sarazin 1991 ) .",
    "this picture would be consistent with the finding that the larger spread in is shown by core galaxies , that are preferentially found in high density environments ( and this is so even for the sample studied here ) .",
    "also it has been suggested that mbh presence and galaxy environment might be connected ( f97 ) ; in this view cores might result from ejection of stars by a coalescing black hole binary during a merging event ( quinlan & hernquist 1997 , nakano & makino 1999 ) .",
    "so , the association of cores and a large spread in x - ray emission could come from a combination of environmental effects and mbh presence ; for example , merging produces triaxiality , and this facilitates the gas to reach the nucleus , and feed the central mbh .",
    "note that just the variety of merging and/or tidal interaction conditions ( time of the event during the galaxy history , progenitors masses and orbits , and so on ) might produce a variety of effects on the hot gas content .",
    "numerical simulations are needed to derive more firm conclusions concerning this aspect ; the first results show that the effect of perturbing the hot gas flows is in the direction of producing a spread in ( dercole et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "while various solutions can be imagined to explain the large range of shown by core galaxies , again a major problem is why power law galaxies do not reach high x - ray luminosities , even when they are in a range of values where core galaxies can be very x - ray luminous .",
    "certainly , they do not seem to experience accretion from outside , because they do not even show values as high as the numerical simulations for the hot gas evolution predict for them when they are isolated ( section 5.1 ) .",
    "so , they should reside in the field of the sample investigated here reside either in the field , or in groups with 3 to 18 members , or in virgo ( ngc4621 ) .",
    "] , or never be the central dominant galaxies in clusters , subclusters and groups . but this seems not to be the case : for example ngc1553 , ngc4697 and ngc5198 are also the brightest members of their groups .",
    "so , the problem remains of why power law galaxies do not become very x - ray bright , even when they are optically dominant .",
    "i have investigated the relationship between x - ray emission and shape of the inner surface brightness profile , for a sample 59 early type galaxies .",
    "i have found that :    @xmath72 the family of core galaxies spans the whole observed range of values ( two orders of magnitude in ) while that of power law galaxies is confined to log ( erg s@xmath0 .",
    "this dicothomy in the x - ray properties holds even in the range where the two families coexist .",
    "@xmath72 the relation between and the shape of the inner profile is sharp , and is stronger than the relations of with the other basic properties characterizing the two families of early type galaxies . for example , being a power law galaxy is connected with a low with no exception , while the same can not be said for the property of having disky isophotes .",
    "so , a global quantity such as is surprisingly tightly connected with a nuclear galaxy property .",
    "@xmath72 different possible reasons can be argued for the origin of the dicothomy in the behavior .",
    "the central profile shape itself should not be the main factor , given the results of previous numerical simulations of the hot gas evolution and the absence of a trend of with the @xmath9 values .",
    "a higher degree of rotation of power law galaxies could produce an effect , but not large enough , and , much like the possibility of a higher degree of flattening of the mass distribution , does not seem to be a general explanation of the reduction in for the whole class of power law galaxies .",
    "@xmath72 it has been suggested that nuclear massive black holes and environmental differences are important for explaining the dicothomy of the inner light profiles ; both aspects are likely to influence the hot gas content .",
    "while a few explanations can be imagined for the large spread in the x - ray luminosities of core galaxies , a clearly open problem is why power law galaxies never become x - ray bright , even when they are the brightest objects of the groups where they reside .",
    "@xmath72 if a massive black hole and the environment have a fundamental role in determining , the problem of interpreting the x - ray properties of early type galaxies becomes much more complex than thought so far , when the input ingredients were just stellar mass loss , supernova heating and gas potential energy .",
