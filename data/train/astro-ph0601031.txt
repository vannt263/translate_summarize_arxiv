    "black - hole candidate x - ray binaries ( bhcs ) are known to show transitions between different spectral states since the first observations of cyg x-1 ( tananbaum et al .",
    "when x - ray instrumentation became sufficiently sophisticated to allow detailed variability studies on short time scales , the definitions of states were refined to include fast timing properties ( van der klis 1995 , 2005 ; mcclintock & remillard 2005 ) .",
    "the number and defining properties of these states have changed with time ( see e.g. homan et al .",
    "2001 ) , but it is now clear that fast variability is key ingredient which needs to be considered in order to have a complete view of the states and state transitions . the spectral evolution of bhcs has recently been described in terms of the pattern in an x - ray hardness - intensity diagram ( hid ) ( see homan & belloni 2005 ; belloni et al .",
    "2005 ; belloni 2005 ) .",
    "original states are found to correspond to different branches / areas of a @xmath1-like hid pattern .",
    "four main states are identified within this framework .",
    "two of them correspond to the original states discovered in the seventies .",
    "the low / hard state ( ls ) , observed usually at the beginning and at the end of an outburst , and the most common state for the persistent system cyg x-1 ( see e.g. dove et al .",
    "1998 ; pottschmidt et al .",
    "2003 ; cadolle bel et al .",
    "2005 ) , is identified by the presence of strong ( @xmath2% fractional rms ) band - limited noise in the power spectrum and by a hard energy spectrum .",
    "the high / soft state ( hs ) shows weak variability , in the form of a few % fractional rms power - law component in the power spectrum , and an energy spectrum dominated by a thermal disc component , with the presence of an additional weak power - law component .",
    "the hs is usually observed , if at all , in the central intervals of an outburst ; it is the most common state in the persistent systems lmc x-1 and lmc x-3 ( nowak et al .",
    "2001 ; wilms et al . 2001 ; haardt et al 2001 ) . for",
    "a comparative example of these two states , see belloni et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . in between these two well - established states ,",
    "the situation is rather complex and has led to a number of different classifications .",
    "homan & belloni ( 2005 ) identify two additional states , clearly defined by spectral / timing transitions . in the evolution of a transient , after the ls comes a transition to the hard intermediate state ( hims ) : the energy spectrum softens as the combined result of a steepening of the power - law component and the appearance of a thermal disc component . at the same time , the characteristic frequencies in the power spectrum increase and the total fractional rms decreases .",
    "a type - c qpo ( see casella , belloni & stella 2005 ) appears , also with centroid frequency increasing as the source softens ( see belloni et al .",
    "the transition to the soft - intermediate state is very sharp ( sometimes over a few seconds , see nespoli et al .",
    "2003 ) and is marked by the disappearance of the type - c qpo and by the appearance of a type - b qpo . in the 3 - 20 kev range ,",
    "the corresponding variations in the energy spectrum are rather minor ( belloni et al . 2005 ) .",
    "together with the association of this transition with the ejection of fast relativistic jets , this has led to the identification of a `` jet line '' in the hid , separating these states ( fender , belloni & gallo 2004 ) .",
    "the jet line can be crossed more than once during an outburst ( as in the case of xte j1859 + 226 : casella et al .",
    "2004 ; brocksopp et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "while the physical nature of the soft component is commonly associated with an optically thick accretion disc , there is no consensus as to the origin of the hard power - law component , where a power law is probably a simplification of a much more complex reality .",
    "the energy spectra include also additional components , important for the physics of accretion around black holes , as emission line features ( see e.g. reynolds & nowak 2003 , miller et .",
    "al 2002 , miller et al . , 2004a ) and compton reflection bumps ( see e.g. george & fabian 1991 , zdziarski et al .",
    "2001 , frontera et al .",
    "the spectral slope of the hard component is around @xmath01.6 for the ls , 1.6 - 2.5 in the sims / hims and 2.5 - 4 for the hs .",
    "one important parameter to measure is the presence / absence of a high - energy cutoff in the spectrum , for which observations at energies @xmath320 kev are necessary .",
    "it is known since a long time ( sunyaev & tr \" umper 1979 ) that the ls spectrum does show such a cutoff around @xmath0100 kev .",
    "a comparative measurement of a number of systems with cgro / osse has been presented by grove et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . here",
    "the energy spectra can clearly be divided into two classes : the ones with a strong soft thermal component and _ no _ evidence of a high - energy cutoff until @xmath01 mev , and those with no soft component and a @xmath0100 kev cutoff . while the second class can clearly be identified with the ls ,",
    "an identification of the first class is not clear . since both the sims / hims and the hs show a strong soft component ( see e.g. nespoli et al .",
    "2003 ) and osse integration times are very long , different states could be mixed , making a precise identification of the source state uncertain .",
    "more recently , zdziarski et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and rodr ' iguez et al .",
    "( 2004 ) measured the high - energy spectrum of grs 1915 + 105 and found no direct evidence for a high - energy cutoff , but spectra which appeared to contain two components .",
    "a hybrid model was found to be necessary to interpret the spectra of cyg x-1 ( malzac et al . , 2005 ;",
    "cadolle bel et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the nature of the hard component in bhcs is not known , nor is it known whether the ones observed in the hs and the ls have the same physical origin . for the ls ,",
    "different models include thermal comptonization ( e.g. dove et al .",
    "1997;1998 ) , bulk motion comptonization",
    "( e.g. laurent & titarchuk 1999 ) , jet syncrotron plus comptonization ( e.g. markoff , falcke & fender 2001 ; markoff , nowak & wilms 2005 ) . for the hs ,",
    "the situation is less clear , partly because of the limited statistics available in the soft spectra and partly because of the absence of an observed characteristic energy such as a high - energy cutoff .",
    "possible models involve non - thermal / hybrid comptonization ( e.g. gierliski et al .",
    "1999 ; zdziarski et al . 2001 ; malzac et al .",
    "2005 ; cadolle bel et al . 2005 ) and bulk - motion comptonization ( e.g. turolla , zane & titarchuk 2002 ) .",
    "gx 3394 was one of the first two bhcs for which a complete set of transitions has been observed and studied ( see miyamoto et al .",

    "this transient black - hole candidate is known to spend long periods in outburst .",
    "historically , it was found prevalently in a hard state , although several transitions were reported ( maejima et al .",

    "1991 ) . from the launch of the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) until 1999",

    "1999 ; nowak , wilms & dove 2002 ; corongiu et al .",

    "this new outburst was followed in detail through timing and color analysis ( belloni et al .",
    "2005 ) , which made it the prototype for the hid evolution and the definitions of the hims / sims .",

    "it is clear that gx 3394 is an extremely important source for our understanding of the accretion and ejection properties of stellar - mass black holes . in february 2004 ,",

    "this suggested an oncoming transition to the sims ( see smith & bushart 2004 ) and prompted us to trigger our rxte / integral campaign .",

    "when necessary ( see below ) , we added spectra using the standard tool mathpha . for the production of the outburst light curve and the corresponding hid ,",

    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the evolution of the power spectra is very similar to that of the previous outburst , but here we have the advantage of having a good number of rossixte observation intervals just before the transition , so that it was possible to follow the evolution of the timing components .",
    "what we found is that , as expected , the multiple components in the power spectrum increase their characteristic frequencies .",
    "all these features can be identified with known components ( belloni et al .",
    "2002 ) , with the exception of a broad bump around a few hz ( see fig .",
    "[ pds ] ) .",
    "the characteristic frequency of this component increases steadily until it reaches a frequency compatible with that of the type - b qpo that appears after the transition ( see fig.[timing ] ) .",
    "it is therefore possible to speculate that these components are related , although we would need more observations of such transitions to asses this identification .    the comparison of the light curves at low and high energies ( see fig .",
    "[ licu ] ) shows that at high energies ( @xmath320 kev ) , where the hard spectral component dominates , the transition is smooth and takes place over a longer time scale than at low energies .",
    "the hexte light curve shows that a considerable reduction in flux ( a factor of @xmath02 ) took place in a few days before the transition , and the isgri data show a smooth decrease by the same factor within one day _ across _ the transition . in other words",
    ", the high - energy curves do not allow to locate the transition .",
    "on the other hand the transition is much more abrupt at low energies ( see the hardness changes in fig .",
    "[ outburst ] and the timing changes ) . although we do not have complete information on the transition at low energies , due to the limited coverage , we know from other systems that the switch between type - c and type - b qpos can take place over a few seconds .",
    "particularly important are the joint rossixte / integral spectral fits .",
    "the amount of information on the high - energy part of the spectrum in different states of black - hole transients is patchy . in the ls , the broad - band spectrum is well studied , both with simple phenomenological models and with complex detailed physical models ( see e.g. frontera et al .",
    "2001 , zdziarski et al .",
    "2001 , merloni & fabian 2002 , turolla , zane & titarchuk 2002 , malzac , merloni & fabian 2004 , falcke , krding & markoff 2004 ) .",
    "the main features of the ls spectra are a rather flat photon index ( @xmath121.6 ) and the clear presence of a high - energy cutoff around 100 kev .",
    "the high - energy spectrum of the hs is less well known , due to its softness .",
    "observations with osse showed that in states different than the ls , there is no evidence of a high - energy cutoff up to @xmath01 mev ( grove et al .",
    "however , the integration times needed to accumulate statistically significant osse spectra are of the order of weeks , and these observations also cover other states such as the hims and the sims , where the hard component is stronger and flatter .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to assess the shape of the high - energy spectra of these states , as transitions can take place on short time scales .",
    "our results constitute one of the first _ bona - fide _ broad - band spectral determination of the hims and the sims on such a short time scale .",
    "the disappearance of the high - energy cutoff in the hexte energy band after the transition to the sims was already reported for xte j1650500 , albeit on a slightly longer time scale ( rossi et al .",
    "the hims , which can be considered as an extension of the ls , shortly before the transition to the sims , shows a spectral slope of @xmath01.9 and a high - energy cutoff around 70 kev .",
    "the spectrum is therefore steeper than in the ls and the high - energy cutoff is at lower energies .",
    "after the transition , in the sims , the power - law is considerably steeper ( @xmath122.3 ) , although slightly less than was observed in the previous outburst ( @xmath13=2.44 , nespoli et al . 2003 ) , and there is no evidence of a high - energy cutoff , with a 90% lower limit of 84 kev ( in 2002 there was some evidence of a cutoff at @xmath0100200 kev ( nespoli et al . 2003 ) .",
    "although we can not exclude the presence of a cutoff , our results show that the cutoff measured in the hims either increases significantly in energy after the transition , or disappears . as to the 4 - 200 kev luminosity of the system , adopting a distance of 6 kpc ( see hynes et al .",
    "2004 ) , the hims has a luminosity of 2.3@xmath14erg / s ( disc ) and 1.1@xmath15erg / s ( powerlaw ) , while in the sims the disc flux becomes 3.0@xmath16erg / s and the power law flux 9.0@xmath17erg / s .",
    "the errors due to the flux reconstruction are still rather large and at 90% confidence the disc and power - law luminosities before and after the transition are consistent .",
    "these total disc + power law luminosity are therefore around 1 - 2% of the eddington luminosity ( for 6@xmath5 ) .",
    "notice that these values are considerably lower than those in nespoli et al .",
    "( 2003 ) for the 2002 transition , as suggested by the difference in detected count rate .",
    "also , here the power - law component dominates the flux , while in 2002 it did not : this is also reflected by the difference in hardness at the transition . in comparison to what was observed in 2002 ( gallo et al .",
    "2004 ; fender , belloni & gallo 2004 ) , we would have expected a radio flare to be triggered by the transition ( homan 2004 ) , but unfortunately we could not obtain radio coverage .",
    "the results presented above constitute one of the first determination of the changes of the broad - band x - ray spectrum of a bhc across the hims - sims transition , which is crucial for the development and testing of theoretical models . although the transition from the ls to the hs is a process that takes days to weeks ( see e.g. belloni et al .",
