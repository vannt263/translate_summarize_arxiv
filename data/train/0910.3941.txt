    "about 84@xmath1 of the non - relativistic matter in the universe is in the form of cold dark matter ( cdm)@xcite , whose nature is still to be discovered .",
    "one of the most promising hypothetical candidates that could account for the cdm observed is the axion @xcite .",
    "the properties of the axion as the cdm particle have been studied in various papers @xcite .",
    "we examine the possibility that the axion accounts for 100@xmath1 cdm in the light of the wmap5 mission , baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) and supernovae ( sn ) data .",
    "we also upgrade the treatment of anharmonicities in the axion potential , which we find important in a specific region of the parameter space .",
    "the axion parameter space is described by three quantities , the pq energy scale @xmath5 , the hubble parameter at the end of inflation @xmath6 and the axion initial misalignment angle @xmath3 .",
    "the solution to the strong - cp problem by peccei and quinn @xcite introduces a new @xmath7 symmetry in the theory of strong interactions that spontaneously breaks at a temperature of order the pq energy scale , @xmath8 .",
    "the axion is the pseudo nambu - goldstone boson originating from the breaking of @xmath7 .",

    "the pq scale @xmath5 is bounded from below by measurements on white dwarfs cooling time , @xmath39gev , while the hubble rate at the end of inflation @xmath6 is bounded from above by non - detection of tensor modes , @xmath40gev . for @xmath23 ( scenario i ) ,",

    "ii , @xmath24 , the parameter space on the top left is bounded by non - detection on axion isocurvature fluctuations that yield @xmath43 .",
    "the upper kink in the leftmost boundary is due to the change in the dependence of the axion mass with temperature , eq.([axion_mass ] ) , while the lower kink is due to the presence of anharmonicities , eq .",
