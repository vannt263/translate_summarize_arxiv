    "soft materials are physical systems of great interest because of their many applications . star polymers , obtained by tethering @xmath2 polymer chains to a central microscopic core , represent a very interesting example . indeed , by changing the functionality @xmath2 , one can interpolate between linear chains ( @xmath3 ) and colloidal spheres , corresponding to @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , their particular nature is responsible for the appearance of many static and dynamic peculiar features which are not observed in suspensions of hard - sphere colloids or of linear chains.@xcite full - monomer simulations of star polymers are very difficult because of the complexity of the structure of these molecules and of the large number of monomers involved .",
    "thus , coarse - grained ( cg ) models , in which each polymer is represented by a single monoatomic molecule sometimes it is called blob  have been widely used .",
    "@xcite to obtain a faithful representation of the star - polymer solution thermodynamics one should consider @xmath5-body interactions among the cg molecules.@xcite a considerable simplification occurs if one only considers the dilute regime in which the polymer packing fraction @xmath6 ( here @xmath7 is the zero - density radius of gyration , while @xmath8 is the number of star polymers in the volume @xmath9 ) is at most of order 1 .",
    "indeed , in this case , overlaps are rare and the contributions due to the @xmath5-body potentials are small . hence , a reasonable approximation is obtained by only considering the pair potential between the cg molecules , which is defined as @xmath10 where the average is over all pairs of isolated star polymers such that the distance between their centers is @xmath11 ; @xmath12 is the total intermolecular energy .",
    "standard renormalization - group arguments indicate that , if one considers stars made of @xmath13 monomers , the adimensional potential @xmath14 is a universal function of @xmath15 in the limit @xmath16 .",
    "universality implies that , for any given @xmath2 , the limiting function @xmath17 is independent of the microscopic model .",
    "the first studies of star polymer solutions at finite density based on cg models@xcite used phenomenological potentials that were inspired by the daoud - cotton model.@xcite they diverged logarithmically as @xmath18 , as predicted theoretically,@xcite and showed an exponential ( yukawa ) decrease for @xmath19 . such a large - distance behavior is consistent with the daoud - cotton model predictions and was somewhat confirmed by the results of ref .  , which found their experimental data to be consistent with an effective interaction decaying as @xmath20 .",
    "such a behavior was also confirmed  albeit with quite large errors  by numerical simulations @xcite of systems with @xmath21 .",
    "subsequent numerical work  but",
    "again arms were quite short  did not confirm the yukawa behavior for @xmath22.@xcite this is not surprising , since the daoud - cotton model@xcite does not apply for small values of @xmath2 .",
    "hence , the phenomenological potential of ref .   can not be used for star polymers with a small number of arms . for these reasons , ref .",
    "suggested that the potential of ref .   should only be used for @xmath23 . for smaller values of @xmath2 ,",
    "a second phenomenological potential was proposed.@xcite it has the correct logarithmic short - distance behavior and shows a gaussian large - distance decay , in agreement with the renormalization - group predictions obtained for linear chains ( @xmath24).@xcite a direct numerical determination of the universal pair potential @xmath17 was undertaken by hsu and grassberger ( hg).@xcite by means of a large - scale simulation of an optimal model ( the domb - joyce model@xcite at a specific value of the interaction parameter ) they obtained accurate estimates of the pair potential for several values of @xmath2 in the range @xmath25 and provided an accurate parametrization of their results which satisfied all theoretical constraints .",
    "they checked the predicted logarithmic divergence for small distances@xcite and found a purely gaussian large - distance decay for all values of @xmath2 investigated .",
    "in particular , while at short distances their numerical potential was close to the potential proposed in ref .  , significant differences were observed at large distances , as a consequence of the different ( yukawa vs gaussian ) decay .",
    "the phenomenological potentials introduced in refs .   have been extensively used to study the phase diagram of star polymers , @xcite binary star polymer systems , @xcite mixtures of star polymers and colloids @xcite and of star and linear polymers , @xcite and structural arrest in dense star polymer systems.@xcite since they are quite different from the exact one derived by hg,@xcite one may question the quantitative and/or qualitative validity of the results obtained .",
    "it is thus worthwhile to repeat these calculations by using all cg models , comparing the results obtained by using the phenomenological potentials with those obtained by using the accurate expression of the pair potential obtained by hg,@xcite which we take as reference potential .    in this paper",
    ", we study the thermodynamic behavior of dilute star - polymer solutions , by using the cg model based on the hg accurate pair potential .",
    "we determine the first virial coefficients , the pressure in the dilute regime , and the intermolecular structure factor which is needed to compare the theoretical results with the experimental ones obtained in scattering experiments .",
    "these results are then compared with the analogous ones obtained by using the phenomenological potentials of refs .  .",
    "finally , we investigate the phase diagram of star polymer solutions , identifying the range of values of @xmath2 for which a liquid - solid transition occurs , again using the hg pair potential .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we introduce the three different cg models . in sec .",

    "differences increase with @xmath2 and range from 8% for @xmath51 to 20% for @xmath52 .",

    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigmavar - comparison ] .",
    "it is evident that @xmath77 for model m1 is quite different from that of model mhg .",
    "but , even worse , the m1 predicted compressibility factor shows an unphysical decrease for @xmath78 , a consequence of the quite rapid decrease of @xmath70 .",
    "clearly , use of a density - dependent corona diameter worsens the thermodynamic behavior of the model .",
    "it is not surprising that @xmath79 is well reproduced while large differences are observed for @xmath77 .",

    "thermodynamic quantities are very sensitive to the tail of the potential , hence differ for models mhg and m1 , even when a density - dependent corona diameter is used .",
    "since star polymers interpolate between linear chains , which only have a fluid phase for all densities , and hard colloids , which have a fluid - solid transition , star polymers are expected to behave in both ways depending on @xmath2.@xcite for @xmath80 one expects only a fluid phase , while for @xmath81 a fluid and a solid phase are expected . in refs .",

    "the solid phase was more complex , with several crystalline states appearing at different densities .",
    "the presence of a solid phase for large values of @xmath2 was later confirmed experimentally : ref .   observed a solid bcc phase by using @xmath87 starlike block copolymer micelles .",
    "since the thermodynamical properties of model m1 are quite different from those of model mhg , we wish now to check if and how the conclusions of ref .",
    "change when potential ( [ potential - hg ] ) is used . to determine the presence of a liquid - solid transition we use two different approximate methods .",
    "first , we use the hansen - verlet criterion:@xcite the phase transition occurs when the maximum @xmath88 of @xmath79 exceeds 2.85 .",
    "second , we use the mhnc method@xcite and identify the phase transition by requiring @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the packing fraction of the reference hard - sphere model .    since potential",
    "mhg has only been computed up to @xmath39 and the region where the fluid - solid transition occurs corresponds to @xmath91 , we have extended the mhg potential to @xmath92 . for this purpose",
    "we need to fix the five parameters that appear in eq .",

    "hence , the hansen - verlet method allows us to infer that @xmath108 .",
    "moreover , the solid phase should appear at values of @xmath71 close to 2 , i.e. in a range of densities that is similar to that reported in ref .  .",
    "the same analysis can be repeated by using the mhnc closure . in fig .",
    "[ fig : mhnc - etahs ] we report @xmath90 as a function of @xmath71 for @xmath101 . for @xmath109 the effective hard - sphere packing fraction is always lower than 0.49 , which gives the boundary of the fluid - solid coexistence line . for @xmath92 , instead it reaches a maximum @xmath110 for @xmath111 .",

    "we find that model m2 provides a reasonable approximation to the thermodynamics and to the structure , even for @xmath56 . on the other hand",
