    "the @xmath8ni beam , of 3.7 e@xmath10a and accelerated to 74.5 mev / nucleon , was fragmented on a natural ni target , 200 @xmath10 m thick .",
    "the fragments were selected by the lise3 separator and implanted into a double - sided silicon strip detector ( dsssd ) .",
    "the detection set - up comprised the aforementioned dsssd detector , 300 @xmath10 m thick , a silicon @xmath11 detector located 28 cm upstream , and four exogam ge clovers surrounding the dsssd .",
    "the exogam clovers were used to detect @xmath0-delayed @xmath2 rays .",
    "the purpose of the dsssd was the detection of both the implanted fragments and the subsequent charged - particle decays , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath0 particles and @xmath0-delayed protons .",
    "an implantation event was defined by simultaneous signals in both the @xmath11 and dsssd detectors .",
    "a decay event was defined by a signal above threshold ( 50 - 90 kev ) in the dsssd and no coincident signal in the @xmath11 .",
    "the implanted ions were identified and selected by putting a gate in a two - dimensional identification matrix , obtained by combining the energy loss signal from the @xmath11 detector and the time - of - flight .",
    "the latter was defined as the time difference between the cyclotron radio - frequency and @xmath11 signal .",

    "the analysis of the charged - particle spectrum measured in the dsssd has provided new spectroscopic information on the energy levels populated in the @xmath1cu nucleus , the @xmath0-daughter of @xmath1zn .",
    "these levels are shown in @xmath12 .",

    "the comparison of this level spectrum with that of the mirror @xmath1co , obtained by the @xmath1fe(@xmath15he,@xmath16 ) charge exchange reaction @xcite , has been very fruitful .",
    "the analysis of the @xmath2 spectrum measured in the exogam clovers and @xmath2-proton coincidences have identified three @xmath2 rays at 309 , 861 and 1835 kev .",

[ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      in the first study of the @xmath1zn @xmath0 decay @xcite , the emission of @xmath0-delayed protons was observed but no @xmath0-delayed @xmath2 rays were seen .",
    "this was not a surprise because , in general , in proton - rich nuclei the proton decay is expected to dominate for states well above ( @xmath181 mev ) the proton separation energy @xmath19 .",
    "the consequence is that normally the @xmath0 feeding is directly inferred from the measured intensities of the proton peaks .",
    "however , cases where there is a competition between @xmath0-delayed proton emission and @xmath0-delayed @xmath2 de - excitation have also been observed , _",
    "e.g. _ , in @xmath20 .",
    "@xcite .    in the @xmath21 decay of @xmath1zn to @xmath1cu",
    ", the @xmath1zn ground state decays with a fermi transition to its isobaric analogue state ( ias ) in @xmath1cu .",
    "it should be noted that the de - excitation of this @xmath22 , @xmath23 ias via proton decay to the ground state of @xmath24ni ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) is isospin forbidden .",
    "therefore the proton emission that we observe can only happen through a @xmath27 = 1 isospin impurity present in the ias .",
    "moreover in general , when the proton emission is isospin forbidden , the competitive emission of de - exciting @xmath2 rays from the ias also becomes possible and can be observed even from ias lying at an excitation energy well above @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "the competition between @xmath0-delayed protons and @xmath2 rays has indeed been observed in @xmath1zn .",
    "the @xmath2 decays represent 56(6)% of the total decays from the 3508 kev ias .",
    "thus one has to take into account the intensities of both the proton and @xmath2 peaks to determine the fermi strength correctly .",
    "we have also found evidence for the fragmentation of @xmath4(f ) due to a strong isospin mixing with a 0@xmath29 state at 3423 kev @xcite , which is important in terms of the mass evaluation @xcite .",
    "the isospin impurity in the @xmath1cu ias , @xmath30 = 33(10)% ( defined as in @xmath7 .",
    "@xcite ) , and the off - diagonal matrix element of the charge - dependent part of the hamiltonian , @xmath31 = 40(23 ) kev , which is responsible for the isospin mixing of the 3508 kev ias ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) and the 0@xmath29 part of the 3423 kev level ( @xmath32 ) , are similar to the values obtained in the mirror @xmath1co nucleus @xcite .    thus , the proton decay of the ias proceeds thanks to the @xmath32 component . however ,",
    "considering the quite large isospin mixing in @xmath1cu , the much faster proton decay ( @xmath33 s ) should dominate on the @xmath2 de - excitation ( @xmath34 s in the mirror ) .",
    "this is not the case since we are still observing the @xmath2 decay of the ias in competition with it",
    ".    the knowledge on the nuclear structure of the three nuclei involved in the decay , _ i.e. _ , @xmath1zn , @xmath1cu and @xmath24ni , can provide us with a possible explanation for the hindrance of the proton decay .",
    "shell model calculations are in progress to clarify this point .",
    "besides the competition between @xmath0-delayed proton emission and @xmath2 decay , the exotic sequence of @xmath0-delayed @xmath2-proton decay has been detected .",
    "indeed @xmath1zn does @xmath0 decay to its ias in @xmath1cu and from there we observe the emission of two @xmath2 rays of 861 and 1835 kev , populating the @xmath1cu levels at 2661 and 1691 kev , respectively . due to the low @xmath19 ,",
    "these levels are still proton - unbound and thereafter they decay by proton emission . consequently the rare and exotic @xmath0-delayed @xmath2-proton decay has been observed .",
    "in addition to these two branches , there is a third case .",
    "the 1691 kev level emits a @xmath2 ray of 309 kev , going to the level at 1391 kev that is again proton - unbound and then it de - excites by proton emission .",
    "the @xmath0-delayed @xmath2-proton decay has been observed here for the first time in the @xmath3 shell .",
    "this rare decay mode was seen only once before , in the @xmath35 shell in @xmath36ar @xcite , but the consequences for the determination of @xmath4(gt ) were not addressed in @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the observation of this special decay mode is very important because it does affect the conventional way to determine @xmath4(gt ) near the proton drip - line . for a proper determination of @xmath4(gt ) , indeed , it is crucial to correct the intensity of the proton transitions for the amount of indirect feeding coming from the @xmath2 de - excitation .",
    "this finding indicates that it is important to employ @xmath2 detectors in such studies .",
    "this decay mode is expected to be significant in heavier proton - rich nuclei with @xmath37 under study at riken .",
