    "eclipsing binaries hold great promise as primary distance and age indicators ( paczynski 1996 ) .",
    "they can be used for establishing accurate distances to globular clusters as well as to galaxies from the local group .",
    "the practical power of this method has been recently demonstrated by guinan et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and fitzpatrick et al .",
    "( 2001 ) who present the analysis of two binaries from the large magellanic cloud .",
    "that project is still in progress and data are being collected for several systems . a long term project known as direct aims to determine the distances to m31 and m33 through observations of eclipsing binaries .",
    "so far the main result obtained by direct is the photometric identification of a dozen or so systems suitable for detailed follow - up observations with large telescopes ( eg .",
    "mochejska et al . 2001 ) . an extensive survey for eclipsing binaries in globular clusters",
    "is conducted by the case project ( http://www.camk.edu.pl/case ) .",
    "the binaries most suitable for the determination of ages of globular clusters are detached systems hosting primaries which have recently finished their evolution on the main - sequence . in such cases",
    "the age can be calculated directly from the age - turnoff mass relation based on stellar models .",
    "the first practical application of this method was presented recently by thompson et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .",
    "attempts to use binaries to measure the distances and ages of globular clusters have been hampered until recently by the paucity of suitable systems .",
    "the situation is changing as several groups are undertaking surveys for main sequence variables in globular clusters .",
    "in particular , the first detached eclipsing binaries were identified a few years ago in the cluster @xmath0  cen by the ogle group ( kaluzny et al .",
    "1996 ) .    in this contribution",
    "we summarize the results of searches for eclipsing binaries in @xmath0  cen .",
    "subsequently , an analysis of the eclipsing binary oglegc17 is presented .",
    "the first eclipsing binary in the field of @xmath0  cen was discovered by martin ( 1938 ) .",
    "variable v78 has a period @xmath3  d and it is a relatively bright object with @xmath4 ( sistero et al .",
    "1969 ) . as it was shown first by geyer & vogt ( 1978 )",
    "this algol type variable is a foreground object unrelated to the cluster . +",
    "subsequently niss et al .",
    "( 1978 ) searched for eclipsing binaries in the central part of the cluster .",
    "their survey was based on 11 photographic plates collected over 5 nights with the newly dedicated 3.6-m telescope at eso .",
    "seven candidates for eclipsing binaries were identified .",
    "one of them , star njl5 , turned out to be the first ever eclipsing binary discovered in any globular cluster .",
    "njl5 is a blue straggler with a period @xmath5  d and an eb type light curve ( liller 1978 ; jensen et al .",
    "it is a `` radial velocity member '' of the cluster ( margon & cannon 1980 ) . + an extensive survey for variable stars in @xmath0  cen was undertaken as a side project of the ogle experiment ( kaluzny et al .",
    "1996 , 1997 ) .",
    "six @xmath6 arcmin@xmath7 fields were monitored with the 1.0-m swope telescope at las campanas observatory .",
    "about 250 @xmath8-band frames were collected for each field and 30 bona fide eclipsing binaries were identified .",
    "most of these are contact systems but the sample includes at least 3 detached binaries with ea - type light curves .",
    "figure 1 shows a schematic color magnitude - diagram of the cluster with the positions of the eclipsing binaries identified by the ogle team .",
    "oglegc-14 with @xmath9  d and @xmath10 is a blue straggler composed of two a - type stars .",
    "its @xmath8-band light curve is presented in fig .",
    "the systemic radial velocity of oglegc-14 ( unpublished ) is compatible with cluster membership , and this system deserves a detailed follow - up investigation .",
    "oglegc-15 with @xmath11  d and @xmath12 is located slightly above the top of the cluster main - sequence on the color - magnitude diagram .",
    "this binary seems to be composed of two upper - main sequence stars .",
    "light curves collected by the case group during the last few years show significant season - to - season variability suggesting that the system belongs to the rs cvn stars .",
    "this classification is supported by the recent identification of oglegc-15 as the optical counterpart of a relatively strong x - ray source ( cool 2002 ) .",
    "the light curve of the system collected during the 2000 season is presented in fig .",
    "the third detached ea - type system identified by the ogle team is oglegc-17 .",
    "this binary was recently investigated in detail by the case collaboration ( thompson et al .",
    "the analysis of spectroscopic and photometric data leads to the determination of absolute parameters for both components of the system .",
    "in particular it was possible for the first time to measure directly the masses of stars in any globular cluster .",
    "moreover the distance modulus to the cluster was derived using the surface brightness method .",
    "below we present some new results on oglegc-17 which are based on superior spectroscopy obtained recently with the vlt uves spectrograph .",
    "+ during the 1999 and 2000 observing seasons the case group monitored two @xmath13  arcmin@xmath7 fields covering the main body of @xmath0  cen .",
    "the data were collected with the 1.0-m swope telescope and a total of 733 and 589 @xmath8-band frames were obtained for the east and west fields , respectively .",
    "ccd images were analyzed with the isis image - subtraction package ( alard 2000 ) .",
    "323 periodic variables were identified : 165 rr  lyr stars ( 15 new ) , 58 sx  phe variables ( 32 new ) , and 42 eclipsing binaries ( 23 new ) .",
    "this sample includes 5 new bona fide detached systems .",
    "a detailed description of these results will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "( kaluzny et al . ; in preparation ) .",
    "following the analysis presented by thompson et al .",
    "( 2001 ) we obtained new radial velocity curves for oglegc-17 .",
    "the new data came from the vlt / uves echelle spectrograph .",
    "they consist of 22 spectra collected near quadrature . from the combined spectra we measured the equivalent widths for the ca ii k - line near phases 0.25 and 0.75 . knowing the b - v color and the luminosity ratio of the components we were able to derive a metallicity of @xmath14=-2.29\\pm 0.15 $ ] from calibration of beers et al .",
    "this value places oglegc-17 in the low metallicity tail of the distribution observed for the cluster .",
    "the following masses of the components were derived : @xmath15 and @xmath16 . from the `` age '' versus `` turn - off mass '' ( see thompson et al .",
    "2001 ) we obtain @xmath17  gyr for the age of the primary component of oglegc-17 .",
    "moreover , using the surface brightness method we derived the apparent distance modulus of the binary @xmath1 .",
