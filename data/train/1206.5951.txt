    "there is currently much interest for electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) in rydberg atoms @xcite , in particular for the cooperative atom - light and photon - photon dynamics found in rydberg systems @xcite and for their possible application , e.g. , in quantum information processing @xcite , in the production of correlated photon pairs @xcite , and in metrology @xcite .",
    "the present work is motivated by a recent experimental study of eit in a 3-level rydberg system with radio frequency ( rf ) modulation @xcite . in this experiment ,",
    "the absorption on the @xmath0@xmath1 transition of @xmath2rb was probed by a weak laser field in the presence of both an rf field and a strong laser field resonant with the transition between the intermediate @xmath3 state and the highly polarizable @xmath4 state .",
    "the rf field was too low in frequency for driving multiphoton transitions between the lower , intermediate or upper states and other bound states .",
    "however , it was strong enough to stark - shift the upper state periodically by tens of mhz , which resulted into the eit features in the probe absorption spectrum shifting and splitting into multiple eit sidebands .",
    "the existence of absorption sidebands is a well known feature of ac - modulated 2-level systems @xcite , including 2-level atomic or molecular systems @xcite .",
    "the effect of an oscillating electric field on molecular absorption lines with quadratic stark shift was described by townes and merritt in 1947 @xcite : lines whose frequency width is much larger than the frequency of modulation adiabatically follow the oscillations of the field  i.e. , a state of dipole polarizability @xmath5 in a non - resonant ac field @xmath6 is simply displaced in energy by @xmath7 ^ 2/2 $ ] at time @xmath8 .",
    "however , lines whose frequency width is of the same order or smaller than the modulation frequency split into manifolds of components displaced in energy from their zero - field limit by @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and the intensity of these components varies with @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 like @xmath14 .",
    "analogous shifts and sidebands are also found in systems governed by an hamiltonian unitarily equivalent to that governing ac - modulated 2-level atomic or molecular systems , such as ac - driven superconducting flux qubits @xcite .",
    "interactions with other fields will in general introduce additional @xmath11-dependent stark shifts . for this reason ,",
    "the separation between adjacent sidebands of an ac modulated 2-level system is not exactly @xmath15 and the intensities of the absorption lines do not exactly follow a @xmath14 law . the correct separations and scalings can be obtained by combining floquet theory and van vleck perturbation theory @xcite . however , these deviations from the results of townes and merritt are significant only when the interaction coupling the two states of the system is sufficiently strong . perhaps for this reason , they do not appear to have been previously considered in an atomic and molecular physics context @xcite .",
    "in many ac - modulated 2-level atomic systems of practical interest , one of the two states is much more polarizable than the other and the frequency widths of both the state and the coupling laser field are small compared to the modulation frequency . in these conditions",
    ", it may be tempting to ignore the manifold structure of the less polarizable state , retain that of the more polarizable state , and model the ac - modulated two - level system as a many - level system in which the less polarizable state interacts with a manifold of independent sideband states .",
    "we refer to this approximate description as the @xmath16-level approximation .",
    "it leads to the results described by townes and merritt @xcite in the limit of a weak interaction between the states and makes it possible to calculate the absorption spectrum rapidly at a minimal cost .",
    "however , as is shown below , this approximation breaks down for strong coupling between the two states : in order to obtain the correct results , the sideband structure of _ both _ states must be properly taken into account .",
    "this can be done , e.g. , by carrying out a full floquet analysis of the ac - modulated 2-level system @xcite , or by solving the optical bloch equations with time - dependent modulation .",
    "the sidebands of the less polarizable state here originate from the coupling of this state to the floquet manifold formed by the other state , not from a direct effect of the ac - modulation .",
    "nonetheless , as is illustrated below , they may manifest by well defined , additional resonance structures in absorption spectra .",
    "we refer to these as induced sidebands .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the changes in the sideband structure of the absorption spectrum arising from the interaction with the coupling laser field , both in two - level and three - level systems .",
    "the absorption spectrum is calculated by solving the optical bloch equations and is interpreted by reference to the floquet quasienergy spectrum .",
    "the @xmath16-level approximation is compared to the exact results throughout the paper . for simplicity ,",
    "we first focus on ac - modulated two - level systems ( sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] ) . the coupling with a lower state is then introduced .",
    "the probe absorption in an rf - modulated 3-state ladder system and the appearance of induced sidebands is studied in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] .",
    "in particular , we give examples of sidebands shift in eit spectra for both cold and thermal ensembles . we conclude with a summary of our main findings ( sec .",
    "[ sec:5 ] ) .",
    "we use atomic units throughout the rest of this paper , except where indicated otherwise .",
    "we first concentrate on the rf dynamics of the subsystem formed by the intermediate and upper states of our 3-level ladder rydberg system , states @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "we thus assume , for the time being , that neither @xmath17 nor @xmath18 interact with the lower state of the system , @xmath19 . making the rotating wave approximation for the laser field and passing to slowly - varying variables",
    "would then reduce the time - dependent schrdinger equation to @xmath20 if the rf field was absent . @xmath21 and @xmath22 are respectively the rabi frequency @xcite ( which we assume real ) and the detuning of the control laser field coupling the states @xmath17 and @xmath18 in the ladder system : denoting the zero - field energies of these two states by @xmath23 and @xmath24 and the angular frequency of the control laser by @xmath25 , @xmath26 with @xmath27 .",

    "moreover , we are also considering systems for which @xmath17 and @xmath49 have the same parity and therefore are not directly coupled to each other by the control laser field . in these conditions , the time - dependent schrdinger equation for the rf - dressed system becomes @xmath53\\end{pmatrix } \\begin{pmatrix}c_{b}\\\\c_{c}\\end{pmatrix}\\label{eq : ht}\\ ] ] where @xmath54    eq .",
