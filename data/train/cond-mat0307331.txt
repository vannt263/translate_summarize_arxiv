    "the study of the dynamical properties of quantum liquids has a storied history.@xcite the interplay of nuclear dynamics , particle statistics , dimensionality , disorder and temperature can lead to , or suppress , dramatic effects such as superfluidity in @xmath0 and superconductivity in the superfluid fermi liquid state of conducting electrons in metals.@xcite due to the great computational difficulties presented by a direct assault on the real - time many - body schroedinger equation , microscopic approaches to calculate the frequency dependent response in condensed phase disordered quantum systems are approximate and generally rely on somewhat uncontrolled approximations .",
    "one approach that has been useful in a variety of physical contexts is the analytic continuation of numerically exact imaginary time path - integral data.@xcite this approach has been fruitful for the study of quantum impurity models such as the anderson hamiltonian,@xcite as well as models of correlated electrons such as the hubbard hamiltonian.@xcite berne and coworkers have successfully applied the maximum entropy ( maxent ) version of analytic continuation to study the dynamics of electrons in simple liquids,@xcite vibrational and electronic relaxation of impurities in liquid and solid hosts,@xcite and adiabatic rate constants in condensed phase environments.@xcite boninsegni and ceperley have applied maxent to study the dynamic structure factor of liquid @xmath0 above and below the @xmath1-transition.@xcite for the normal state , they find good agreement with experimental results , while the agreement is significantly worse in the superfluid state .",
    "in particular , sharp quasiparticle peaks are not well resolved with the maxent approach.@xcite this failure arises from the intrinsic ill - posed nature of the numerical continuation to the real - time axis .",

    "para_-hydrogen , where finite frequency quasiparticle peaks appear in the dynamic structure factor , @xmath2 , resonates with the general result of cugliandolo and lozano that `` trivial '' quantum fluctuations add coherence to the decay of dynamics correlators at short - times.@xcite furthermore , in principle we could study a range of problems related to the physics of glassy quantum systems , including the aging behavior of an out - of - equilibrium quantum liquid.@xcite because the maxent approach relies implicitly on the equilibrium formulation of quantum statistical mechanics , this approach can not be used to investigate such questions .    in order to study such interesting problems , as well as",
    "the challenges imposed by nontrivial collective behavior exhibited , for example , by superfluid @xmath0 , we need to further develop our theoretical apparatus . in our previous studies , we imposed self - consistency in the study of single - particle properties , but not in the more difficult case of collective properties such as the dynamics of density fluctuations.@xcite in this work , we make several accurate and physically motivated approximations that render the formal equations presented in ref .",
    "amenable to direct numerical investigation .",
    "we revisit the problem of the study of @xmath2 in liquid _ ortho_-deuterium and _ para_-hydrogen , and show that a fully self - consistent treatment of density fluctuations greatly improves the agreement between the low frequency behavior seen in experiments and corrects the behavior of our previously used quantum viscoelastic theory.@xcite this low frequency behavior associated with the long time relaxation of density fluctuations in these liquids is not well captured by the maxent approach .",

    "the formulation of the quantum mode - coupling theory ( qmct ) described in ref .   is based on the kubo transform of the dynamical correlation function of interest . for collective density fluctuations",

    "the quantum mode - coupling theory described in this section provides a set of closed , self - consistent equations for @xmath3 , which can be used to generate the dynamic structure factor using the above transformations .",

    "following the projection operator procedure outlined in our early work,@xcite the time evolution of the kubo transform of the intermediate scattering function , @xmath17 ( @xmath18 denote a quantum mechanical ensemble average ) , is given by the exact quantum generalized langevin equation @xmath19 where the notation @xmath7 implies that the quantity under consideration involves the kubo transform given by  @xcite @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the hamiltonian operator of the system . in the above equation @xmath22",

    "the above equations for the time evolution of the intermediate scattering function is simply another way for rephrasing the quantum wigner - liouville equation .",
    "the difficulty of numerically solving the wigner - liouville equation for a many - body system is shifted to the difficulty of evaluating the memory kernel given by eq .",

    "the basic idea behind our approach is that the binary portion of the memory kernel contains all the short time information and is obtained from a short time moment expansion , while the mode - coupling portion of the memory kernel describes the decay of the memory kernel at intermediate and long times , and is approximated using a quantum mode - coupling approach.@xcite    the fast decaying binary term determined from a short - time expansion of the exact kubo transform of the memory function is given by @xmath34 the lifetime in eq .",

    "the slow decaying mode - coupling portion of the memory kernel , @xmath33 , must be obtained from a quantum mode - coupling approach . the basic idea behind",
    "this approach is that the random force projected correlation function , which determines the memory kernel for the intermediate scattering function ( cf .",
    "( [ eq : fkernel ] ) ) , decays at intermediate and long times predominantly into modes which are associated with quasi - conserved dynamical variables .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the decay of the memory kernel at long times will be governed by those modes that have the longest relaxation time .",

    "the ( kubo ) convolution approximation has been developed,@xcite leading to : @xmath54 while for @xmath55 we have used the fact that the kubo transform @xmath56 can be approximated by @xmath57 , @xmath13 being the mass of the particle , within an error that is less then one percent for the relevant @xmath58 values studied in this work .",
    "based on this fact , we approximate @xmath59 by : @xmath60 the combination of these approximations lead to a simplified vertex given by @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the quantum mechanical static structure factor ( non kubo transformed version ) . at high values of @xmath63 the vertex should decay to zero , while the approximation fails to do so . hence , in the applications discuss below we employ a cutoff to overcome the shortcoming of our approximation .",
    "below we discuss the choice of cutoff for the two model systems studied .    to obtain the kubo transform of the intermediate scattering function , one requires as input the frequency factor @xmath22 , and the memory kernel @xmath50 . since the memory kernel depends on @xmath3 , the equation of motion for the intermediate scattering function ( eq .",

    "an alternative approach to the quantum mode - coupling theory is based on the numerical maximum entropy analytic continuation approach , which has recently been used by boninsegni and ceperley to study density fluctuations in liquid helium.@xcite in this section we provide a short outline of maximum entropy analytic continuation approach applicable to study collective density fluctuations in quantum liquids .    the analytic continuation of the intermediate scattering function is based on the fourier relation between @xmath2 and @xmath64 : @xmath65 the dynamic structure factor is thus analogous to the spectral density used in the analytic continuation of spectral line shapes  @xcite and to the frequency dependent rate constant or diffusion constant used in analytic continuation of rates.@xcite by performing the replacement @xmath66 , and using the detailed balance relation @xmath67 we obtain @xmath68 s(q,\\omega ) , \\label{eq : fqtau1}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 , and @xmath70 the reason for introducing the imaginary time intermediate scattering function , @xmath71 , is that , unlike its real time counterpart , it is straightforward to obtain it using an appropriate path - integral monte carlo simulation technique.@xcite however , in order to obtain the dynamic structure factor and the real time intermediate scattering function one has to invert the integral in eq .",

    "( [ eq : fqtau1 ] ) is an ill - posed problem . as a consequence ,",
    "a direct approach to the inversion would lead to an uncontrollable amplification of the statistical noise in the data for @xmath71 , resulting in an infinite number of solutions that satisfy eq .",
    "( [ eq : fqtau1 ] ) .",
    "clearly , in this case , little can be said about the real time dynamics and the corresponding dynamic structure factor .    in recent years",
    ", bayesian ideas have been used to deal with the ill - posed nature of continuing the noisy imaginary time monte carlo data to real time.@xcite one of the most widely used approaches is the maximum entropy method.@xcite the method requires only that the transformation which relates the data and the solution be known . furthermore , maximum entropy allows the inclusion of prior knowledge about the solution in a logically consistent fashion . as such , the method is well - suited for solving ill - posed mathematical problems .    in the language of the maximum entropy method",
    "@xmath71 is the data , @xmath72 is the singular kernel , and @xmath2 is the solution , also referred to as the map .",
    "maximum entropy principles provide a way to choose the most probable solution which is consistent with the data through the methods of bayesian inference .",
    "typically , the data is known only at a discrete set of points @xmath73 , and thus we search for the solution at a discrete set of points @xmath74 .",
    "the maximum entropy method selects the solution which maximizes the posterior probability , or the probability of the solution @xmath75 given a data set @xmath76 .",
    "the posterior probability is given by  @xcite @xmath77 here @xmath78 is the standard mean squared deviation from the data , and @xmath79 is the information entropy.@xcite    obtaining the maximum entropy solution then involves finding a map @xmath2 which maximizes the posterior probability and is therefore a maximization problem in @xmath80 variables , where @xmath80 is the number of points @xmath74 at which the solution is evaluated .",
    "the solution obtained in this way is still conditional on the arbitrary parameter @xmath81 , which can be interpreted as a regularization parameter . in this work ,",
    "we use a flat default map that satisfies a known sum rule , such as the integral over @xmath2 , and @xmath81 is selected according to the l - curve method.@xcite in this case we regard @xmath81 as a regularization parameter controlling the degree of smoothness of the solution , and entropy as the regularizing function . the value of @xmath81 is selected by constructing a plot of @xmath82 $ ] vs. @xmath83 .",
    "this curve has a characteristic l - shape , and the corner of the l , or the point of maximum curvature , corresponds to the value of @xmath81 which is the best compromise between fitting the data and obtaining a smooth solution .",
    "although it is known that liquid _ ortho_-deuterium and liquid _",
    "para_-hydrogen may be treated as boltzmann particles without the complexity of numerically treating particle statistics,@xcite they still exhibits some of the hallmarks of a highly quantum liquid .",
    "in fact , recent theoretical  @xcite and experimental studies  @xcite show that these dense liquids are characterized by quantum dynamical susceptibilities which are not reproducible using classical theories .",
    "thus , these liquids are ideal to assess the accuracy of methods developed for quantum liquids such as the self consistent quantum mode - coupling theory and the maximum entropy analytic continuation approach .    here",
    "we report on a direct comparison between these methods for collective density fluctuations in liquid _ ortho_-deuterium and liquid _ para_-hydrogen .",
    "a comparison between the two approaches has been made for self - transport in liquid _",
    "para_-hydrogen  @xcite where good agreement has been observed for the real time velocity autocorrelation function .",
    "however , the present comparison is more challenging since the experimental dynamic structure factor for these liquids is characterized by more than a single frequency peak ( unlike the case of self - transport),@xcite indicating that more than a single timescale is involved in the relaxation of the density fluctuations .",
    "so far , in the context of our molecular hydrodynamic approach , density fluctuations in these dense liquids has been described only within the quantum viscoelastic model  @xcite which fails to reproduce the low frequency peak in @xmath2 that is associated with long time dynamics .",
    "therefore , one challenge for the improved self - consistent quantum hydrodynamic approach and for the analytic continuation method is to recover this long time behavior .      to obtain the static input required by the quantum mode - coupling theory and the imaginary time intermediate scattering function required for the analytic continuation approach we have performed pimc simulations at @xmath84 and @xmath85 for liquid _",

    "the fact that our qmct captures the position of both the low and high intensity peaks in the dynamic structure factor and their width for nearly all wavevectors studied is an important result , since our previous studies in which we invoked a single relaxation time for the memory kernel of the qgle ( the qvm ) failed to reproduce the low frequency peak.@xcite it is the self - consistent treatment of the mode - coupling portion of the memory kernel that accounts for a proper description of the intermediate to long time dynamics is these systems , and the proper treatment of the vertex in the memory kernel .",
