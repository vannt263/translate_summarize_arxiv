    "nonlocal measurement refers to the detection of a voltage signal outside the path , along which charge current is expected to flow .",
    "one way to generate the nonlocal voltage is to modify the charge current path away from the classic ohmic mode@xcite .",
    "for instance , in the quantum hall regime , the current transports along edges while the bulk is insulating@xcite . another important way for the generation of the nonlocal voltage is to induce current with other degrees of freedom ( i.e. spin / valley ) , so that the current direction will deviate from the exciting field .",
    "since the nonlocal voltage always originates from nontrivial physics that is not easy to detect directly , the nonlocal measurement has now become a powerful tool to discover such kinds of electromagnetic phenomena in many novel materials @xcite .",
    "spin hall effect ( she ) is a phenomenon arising from the spin - orbit coupling in which charge current passing through a sample leads to spin transport in the transverse direction @xcite . since only the electron spin , rather than the electron charge , accumulates during the spin transport process , it is always difficult to observe the she with local measurements . fortunately , with the method of nonlocal measuring , a large nonlocal resistance @xmath0 was reported near the dirac point in h - shaped graphene sample @xcite , which confirms the existence of the she . moreover ,",
    "the nonlocal measurement was also used to detect valley hall effect ( vhe ) @xcite , whose transport mechanism is similar to the she , and a giant nonlocal resistance can be observed as well .",
    "abanin et al . developed a theory to discuss the origin of the above - mentioned nonlocal resistance@xcite . in their paper",
    ", they demonstrated that the relationship between the nonlocal resistance @xmath0 and the local resistance @xmath1 can be described by a simple function of @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the spin hall conductance .",
    "however , this equation remains difficult to explain some experimental results .",
    "specifically , besides the giant peak of @xmath0 , people also find another interesting phenomenon that , compared with @xmath1 , @xmath0 decays much more rapidly when fermi energy deviates from the dirac point .",
    "we consider fig.1(b ) of ref .",
    "[ ] as an example .",
    "when @xmath6v , the red line of @xmath0 has already collapsed to zero , whereas the black line of @xmath1 is still finite .",
    "this novel phenomenon seems to be inconsistent with ref .",
    "[ ] , because the zero value of @xmath0 can not be proportional to @xmath7 , which deserves further explanations .",
    "recently , with an extrinsic perpendicular electric field , chen s group at peking university also detected a nonlocal voltage signal in an h - shaped graphene sample@xcite .",
    "when the fermi energy deviates from the dirac point , the nonlocal resistance shows analogous behavior that @xmath0 decreases to zero much more quickly than @xmath1 .",
    "this experimental work motivates us to study the nonlocal resistance numerically by considering standard monolayer graphene with an extrinsic rashba effect .",
    "firstly , in an h - shaped four - terminal system , we obtain @xmath1 and @xmath0 by means of the non - equilibrium green s function method , where the numerical results exhibits the same properties as the experimental findings , namely , a giant peak and an obviously fast decay of the nonlocal resistance by tuning the fermi energy .",
    "secondly , we find that @xmath0 can be negative in a certain region .",
    "this phenomenon implies the existence of the quasi - ballistic transport mechanism , which was observed previously@xcite .",
    "therefore , we conclude that @xmath0 consists of three parts : @xmath8 due to the ballistic mechanism , @xmath9 from the classic diffusion and @xmath3 from the she . since the negative value of @xmath8 locates around the dirac point , it is possible that the quasi - ballistic mechanism contributes to the fast decay of @xmath0 .",
    "thirdly , in order to further investigate the relationship between this fast decay and the rashba effect , we study a six - terminal system and obtain the nonlocal resistance @xmath3 which is only caused by the she .",
    "surprisingly , the results show that @xmath3 equals to zero at the dirac point .",
    "since the she always makes a nonnegative contribution to @xmath0 , we conclude that there is not any relationship between the rashba effect and the fast decay of @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , it is the extremely small density of states ( dos ) near the dirac point and the quasi - ballistic mechanism that lead to the large peak and the fast decay of @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "moreover , the rashba effect itself actually plays a negative role in the fast decay of @xmath0 .",
    "finally , with the spin hall conductance @xmath5 calculated in a four - terminal system , we modify the previous theoretical formula @xmath4 by replacing @xmath0 with @xmath3 , and find that this revised formula holds well for the present case .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    ", we numerically calculate the local and nonlocal resistance in an h - shaped four - terminal system .",
    "then , in sec.iii , we study a six - terminal system to obtain the nonlocal resistance which is merely caused by the she , and compare it with the previous theoretical prediction .",
    "finally , a conclusion is presented in sec.iv .",
    "we first consider an h - shaped four - terminal system to simulate the nonlocal measurement@xcite , where the schematic diagram is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fourdiagram1 ] . due to the strong external electric field",
    ", the tight - binding hamiltonian can be written as : @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the creation and annihilation operators , respectively , at site @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the on - site energy , and @xmath15 is the strength of the external rashba effect .",
    "the on - site energies of the four terminals are chosen as @xmath16 to simulate metallic leads , which can be controlled by the gate voltage .",
    "the disorder only exists in the central region and is modeled by anderson disorder with the on - site energies being uniformly distributed in @xmath17 $ ] , where @xmath18 is the disorder strength .",
    "the schematic diagram of the central region is described by parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "for instance , figure  [ fig : fourdiagram1 ] shows a system with @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , the system has @xmath23 $ ] carbon atoms in total .",

    "can be further deduced according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : current ] ) under the conditions of @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "at last , the local and nonlocal resistance can be calculated@xcite . to be specific ,",
    "the local resistance is defined as : @xmath38 , and the nonlocal resistance is defined as : @xmath39 .    throughout this work , we take the nearest hopping energy @xmath40 as the energy unit . in the following calculation , the value of the on - site energy @xmath41 is testified in the energy bands of zigzag ribbons , in order to simulate four metallic leads .",
    "the size parameters @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath20 are chosen as @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "this indicates that the size of the model we calculated is about @xmath49.@xcite in the presence of anderson disorder , the resistance has been averaged over 50 times .     and nonlocal resistance @xmath0",
    "are drawn in the blue and red line , respectively .",
    "( a ) @xmath50 ; ( b ) @xmath51 ; ( c ) @xmath52 ; ( d ) @xmath53 .",
    "the anderson disorder strength is chosen as @xmath54 . in order to make the comparison clear enough ,",
    "the value of @xmath0 is amplified by @xmath55 times . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : nonlocal1 ] , we show the local resistance ( blue lines ) and the nonlocal resistance ( red lines ) as a function of the fermi energy @xmath56 . from fig .",
    "[ fig : nonlocal1](a ) to [ fig : nonlocal1](d ) , the rashba spin - orbit strength @xmath15 increases from @xmath50 to @xmath53 , while the other parameters remain unchanged .",
    "as we can see , there are three main features in these four figures .",
    "firstly , the nonlocal resistance exhibits negative value in fig .",
    "[ fig : nonlocal1](a ) .",
    "such `` negative '' means that when the current flows from lead 1 to lead 2 , the voltage detected on lead 3 is surprisingly lower than that on lead 4 .",
    "a similar behavior can also be found in fig .",
    "[ fig : nonlocal1](b ) that a pair of dips exist at about @xmath57 , though their values are not negative .",
    "this phenomenon can be explained by the quasi - ballistic transport mechanism which was first predicted in experiments@xcite .",
    "specifically , the charge carriers injected into lead 1 can flow directly to lead 4 without returning back to lead 2 .",
    "this indicates that we can detect a positive voltage on lead 4 and a negative voltage on lead 3 , which means the value of the nonlocal resistance is negative .",
    "therefore , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fourdiagram2 ] , we conclude that the nonlocal resistance @xmath0 consists of three terms : @xmath58 here , the first part @xmath8 stands for the ballistic transport mechanism we discussed above .",
    "the second part @xmath9 represents the classical diffusion . and",
    "the third part @xmath3 originates from the spin - orbit coupling term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) , where the electron current flowing along the left vertical wires generates a perpendicular spin current due to the she , and is finally converted to the electron current in the right vertical wires due to the inverse spin hall effect ( ishe ) .    secondly , both the local and nonlocal resistance are symmetric about the line of @xmath59 and reach their maxima at @xmath59 .",
    "importantly , similar to the findings in previous experiments , the nonlocal resistance @xmath0 collapses to zero much more rapidly compared with the local resistance @xmath1 .",
    "in other words , the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the nonlocal resistance is much smaller than that of the local resistance .",
    "for example , we can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : nonlocal1](c ) that the nonlocal resistance is decreased to nearly zero and is maintained at about @xmath60 when @xmath61 , while the local resistance @xmath1 is still decreasing .",
    "this phenomenon is contradictory to the known formula@xcite : @xmath62 where @xmath5 is the spin hall conductance .",
    "in fact , it seems that this contradiction can be partially explained by our analysis on the negative nonlocal resistance .",
    "specifically , the original value of the nonlocal resistance is @xmath3 , which satisfies eq .",
    "( [ eq : abanin ] ) . and",
    "@xmath9 may result in a large peak near @xmath59 due to the extremely small dos at the dirac point .",
    "moreover , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : ballistic ] ) , there must exist an additional term @xmath8 to @xmath0 .",
    "since the value of @xmath8 is negative , it is natural that @xmath0 decays to zero much more rapidly than the theoretical prediction as shown eq .",
    "( [ eq : abanin ] ) .",
    "thirdly , according to the known literatures , most of them attribute the fast decay of the nonlocal resistance to the she or the vhe .",
    "although our model is not exactly the same as those in the known literatures , it is reasonable for us to make the same assumption .",
    "however , by inspecting fig .",
    "[ fig : nonlocal1 ] , the only phenomenon we can find between the nonlocal resistance and the she is that the negative nonlocal resistance becomes weaker and weaker , and gradually disappears with the increase of the spin - orbit coupling strength @xmath15 .",
    "correspondingly , the shrinking speed slows down as well .",
    "namely , we can only expect that the she mainly affects the value of @xmath0 around @xmath57 .",
    "therefore , only fig .",
    "[ fig : nonlocal1 ] itself is not enough for us to fully understand the underlying mechanism between the nonlocal resistance and the she .",
    "actually , we do not even know whether the fast decay of the nonlocal resistance has any relationship to the she .",
    "therefore , it is necessary for us to obtain pure @xmath3 besides @xmath0 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nonlocal1 ] .",
    "one simple way is to take @xmath0 in fig .",
    "[ fig : nonlocal1](a ) with @xmath50 as a reference line , and we then subtract this reference line from @xmath63 to obtain @xmath64 . however , after making this attempt , we find that the result is messy and disordered , indicating that the ballistic transport and the classic diffusion are also affected by the she .",
    "therefore , we can not simply take fig .",
    "[ fig : nonlocal1](a ) as a reference line to calculate @xmath3 , and we further consider a different system to investigate the rashba effect in the next section .",
    "in order to further study how the external rashba effect affects the nonlocal resistance , we investigate the transport properties of a six - terminal system , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : sixdiagram ] , instead of the h - shaped four - terminal one .",
    "the only difference between fig .",
    "[ fig : sixdiagram ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : fourdiagram1 ] is that we add two leads ( lead 3 and lead 4 ) at the left side of lead 1 and lead 2 , and keep them at the mirror sites of lead 3 and lead 4 .",
    "if a spin up current is injected into lead 1 , e.g. , by adding a ferromagnetic lead , we can detect voltage signals @xmath65 on lead 3 and lead 4 .",
    "then the nonlocal resistance is written as : @xmath66 similarly , regarding a spin down current , the voltage @xmath67 is detected and the nonlocal resistance is expressed as : @xmath68 since the ballistic transport and the classic diffusion have no relationship to the spin direction , the nonlocal resistance @xmath8 and @xmath9 caused by these two mechanisms must be the same along the two different spin directions , i.e. , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , with the detected @xmath71 and @xmath72 , we can easily remove the perturbations of the ballistic transport and the classic diffusion based on this two - step proposal .",
    "finally , we can obtain the pure result caused by the rashba effect as : @xmath73 although we have not obtained @xmath74 , we will prove that @xmath75 itself demonstrates the value of @xmath74 in the next paragraph .",
    "in fact , the most advantage of this six - terminal system is that when the spin up current is injected into lead 1 , we can also detect voltage signals @xmath76 between leads 3 and 4 , besides that between leads 3 and 4 . according to the symmetric analysis",
    ", @xmath76 should be equal to the voltage @xmath67 between leads 3 and 4 with the spin down current .",
    "therefore , we can easily obtain @xmath77 by one step without changing the magnetization direction of lead 1 , which is very important in the realistic experiments . from now on , for clarity , we always consider the spin currents along the two directions , though both the numerical calculations and experiments need only one kind of spin currents in reality .     for two spin directions .",
    "( b ) the nonlocal resistance @xmath0 for two spin directions . and the inset is the spin hall conductance @xmath5 .",
    "( c ) the black line is calculated based on @xmath78 . since the numerical error results in dramatic oscillation of @xmath78 near @xmath59",
    ", we add a red dashed line to describe the accurate behavior of @xmath78 near the dirac point . at last , the blue line represents @xmath3 that equals to the absolute value of the black line , and the fix in red line is also considered .",
    "( d ) @xmath3 calculated based on eq .",
    "( [ eq : abanin ] ) . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : nonlocal2](a ) , we first show the local resistance @xmath1 calculated according to the above proposal . since the local resistance has no relationship to the she and is not sensitive to the spin direction , the local resistances in the two different spin directions exhibit almost the same behavior .",
    "then , in fig .  [ fig : nonlocal2](b ) , we show the nonlocal resistance @xmath71 and @xmath72 , which reflect the nonlocal resistance purely caused by the she .",
    "it is clear that both @xmath71 colored by blue and @xmath72 colored by red are asymmetric .",
    "@xmath71 with @xmath79 is smaller than that with @xmath80 , and @xmath72 shows the opposite behavior . according to the discussion of the hall effect part in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ballistic ] ) , the above phenomenon can be explained by the spin hall conductance @xmath5@xcite , which is calculated in a four - terminal system and is shown in the inset of fig .  [ fig : nonlocal2](b ) .",
    "specifically , @xmath5 is antisymmetric about the original point : @xmath81 and @xmath82 when @xmath80 .",
    "as we all know , the sign reversing of @xmath5 denotes the direction conversing of the she .",
    "that is to say , if we assume that the spin up current turns left with a positive @xmath5 through the she ( other conditions can be analyzed similarly ) , the spin up current injected into lead 1 will turn left as described by the red line in fig .",
    "[ fig : sixdiagram ] when @xmath80 .",
    "thus , the spin up current will contribute to @xmath83 and be reflected in @xmath0 through the she .",
    "this also tells us that , when @xmath79 , the spin up current will turn right as descried by the yellow line in fig .",
    "[ fig : sixdiagram ] , which means we can hardly detect its signal caused by the she on leads 3 and 4 . while for fig .",
    "[ fig : nonlocal2](b ) , since @xmath71 of @xmath79 is smaller than that of @xmath80 , we can conclude that it is spin up current that turns left when @xmath80 as described by the red line in fig .",
    "[ fig : sixdiagram ] .",
    "correspondingly , the spin down current will turn left when @xmath79 , just as the red line in fig .",
    "[ fig : nonlocal2](b ) . therefore , the nonlocal resistance for the spin up current in the region of @xmath79 and the spin down current for @xmath80 can be regarded as the reference line without the she . in other words , we can obtain @xmath3 just by subtracting @xmath71 from @xmath72 when @xmath79 and subtracting @xmath72 from @xmath71 when @xmath80 : @xmath84    since eq .",
    "( [ eq : abanin ] ) only considers the she without any other effects , @xmath0 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : abanin ] ) should be replaced by @xmath3 actually . in fig .",
    "[ fig : nonlocal2](c ) , we first draw the nonlocal resistance @xmath3 colored in black based on @xmath77 . the drastic oscillation around @xmath59 mainly results from the numerical errors , because the values of @xmath85 around @xmath59 shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : nonlocal2](b ) are very sharp , and a small error seems aggravating in fig .  [",
    "fig : nonlocal2](c ) . according to fig .",
    "[ fig : nonlocal2](b ) , @xmath5 equals to zero at @xmath59 , which means there exists no she at the dirac point .",
    "thus , @xmath0 should not be sensitive to the spin direction , and @xmath71 must be equal to @xmath72 at @xmath59 .",
    "hence , the accurate value of @xmath77 should follow the red dashed line drawn in fig .",
    "[ fig : nonlocal2](c ) , which connects the two peaks and passes through the origin .",
    "then , in order to further justify our results , we also calculate @xmath3 with the local resistance @xmath1 and the spin hall conductance @xmath5 according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : abanin ] ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : nonlocal2](d ) , and compare these two figures obtained by the two different methods . as we can see , after folding fig .",
    "[ fig : nonlocal2](c ) by calculating the absolute value of @xmath77 , as shown by the blue line in fig .",
    "[ fig : nonlocal2](c ) , the general behaviors of the two blue lines in fig .  [ fig : nonlocal2](c ) and  [ fig : nonlocal2](d ) look the same .",
    "the minor difference may be caused by the proportional signal in eq .",
    "( [ eq : abanin ] ) , which may contain parameters sensitive to the fermi energy .",
    "importantly , we find that @xmath86 for @xmath59 , which means the peak of the nonlocal resistance shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nonlocal1 ] has no relationship to the she .",
    "in contrast to our previous prediction , this phenomenon also means the rapid shrinking of @xmath0 with the deviation of @xmath56 compared to @xmath1 is not caused by the rashba effect .",
    "moreover , in fig .",
    "[ fig : nonlocal2](c ) and [ fig : nonlocal2](d ) , we find there exist a pair of peaks around @xmath57 , which originates from the rashba effect .",
    "thus , it is natural that the stronger the rashba effect is , the more obvious the peaks become .",
    "now , we can explain the third feature of fig .",
    "[ fig : nonlocal1 ] in sec.ii . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nonlocal1 ] , the negative nonlocal resistance appears around @xmath57 , which is exactly where the peaks of @xmath3 locate .",
    "thus , it is the peak of @xmath3 that counteracts the negative value of the nonlocal resistance @xmath0 . as a result",
    ", we find that the negative value of @xmath0 gradually disappears with the increasing rashba effect , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nonlocal1 ] .    to summarize , with the calculated @xmath3 and further analysis , we first conclude that the large peak of the nonlocal resistance at @xmath59 has no relationship to the rashba effect . actually , it is possible that this large peak mainly originates from the extremely small dos of the monolayer graphene at the dirac point . similar to our results ,",
    "not long ago , several groups also doubted the direct connection between the peak of @xmath0 and the she as assumed in early papers@xcite .",
    "then , we know that the fast decay of the nonlocal resistance is not caused by the rashaba effect as predicted . considering sec.ii , it is the negative @xmath8 caused by the ballistic transport that leads to this interesting phenomenon .",
    "moreover , since there exists one pair of @xmath3 peaks at @xmath57 where the negative dip of @xmath8 locates , the rashba effect itself actually plays a negative role to the fast decay of the nonlocal resistance .",
    "that is also why we find the tendency of the rapid shrinking of @xmath0 becomes weaker and weaker in fig .",
    "[ fig : nonlocal1 ] .",
    "in conclusion , using the non - equilibrium green s function method , we obtain the local and nonlocal resistance in an h - shaped graphene , similar to the real experiments . specifically ,",
    "there does exist a large peak of the nonlocal resistance @xmath0 at the dirac point .",
    "in particular , we do find @xmath0 decreasing much more quickly than @xmath1 when the fermi energy deviates from the dirac point . besides",
    ", we have proven that the total nonlocal resistance @xmath0 stems from three kinds of mechanisms : the ballistic transport @xmath8 , the classic diffusion @xmath9 and the she @xmath3 . after a further calculation of a six - terminal system ,",
    "we conclude that the peak of @xmath0 and its rapid decrease do not result from the rashba effect , but originate from the small dos near the dirac point and the ballistic transport , respectively .",
    "moreover , the rashba effect itself actually plays a negative role in this rapid decrease .",
    "the whole physical pictures behind can be concluded as : first , because of the extremely small dos , there exists a giant peak of the nonlocal resistance at the dirac point ; then , due to the ballistic transport mechanism , the negative value of @xmath8 leads to the fast decay of @xmath0 ; and finally , @xmath3 originating from the she will offset this fast decay somewhat .    though lots of experiments found the signal of giant nonlocal resistance @xmath0 , which decreases much more rapidly compared with the local resistance @xmath87 , in an h - shaped graphene , and attributed them to the spin / valley hall effect",
    ", we give a numerical simulation presenting an explanation different from the previous prediction . here",
    ", we have to emphasize that this difference does not mean that all previous conclusions obtained from the experiments are incorrect , because the model , the sample size and the spin - orbit coupling we use might be different .",
    "finally , the six - terminal method proposed in this work is very helpful to study the underlying mechanism of transport with the she , because the she itself is always mixed with and not easy to be separated from other mechanisms , such as the classical diffusion etc .",
    "we thank the insightful discussions with jie liu , ai - min guo , qing - feng sun , jianhao chen , xi lin and wei han .",
