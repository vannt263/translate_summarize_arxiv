    "of many families of fe - based superconductors and related materials @xcite the _ ae_fe@xmath3as@xmath3 ( _ ae _ = alkaline earth and eu ) , so called 122 family , is apparently the most studied @xcite .",
    "the 122 family allows for substitution on all three crystallographic sites and , as a result , a complex combination of carrier - doping and anisotropic steric effects can be studied , while maintaining , at room temperature and ambient pressure , the same , tetragonal , thcr@xmath3si@xmath3 - type crystal structure .",
    "starting from the parent , _ ae_fe@xmath3as@xmath3 compounds , superconductivity can be induced either by properly designed substitution , or by application of pressure , or by combination of both routes .",
    "historically , the main body of work on the 122 family was focused on the transition metal ( _ tm _ ) substitutions for fe : it ae(fe@xmath1_tm_@xmath2)@xmath3as@xmath3 , due to relative ease of growing homogeneous , relative large single crystals @xcite .",
    "substitutions for @xmath10 , as in the ba@xmath1k@xmath2fe@xmath3as@xmath3 series @xcite , or for as as in the bafe@xmath3(as@xmath1p@xmath2)@xmath3 series @xcite have been explored , but both series require significant efforts to achieve homogeneity and/or reasonable size of the crystals .",
    "the global phase diagrams obtained by substitution for ba [ e.g. hole - doping in ba@xmath1k@xmath2fe@xmath3as@xmath3 ] , fe [ e.g. electron - doping in ba(fe@xmath1co@xmath2)@xmath3as@xmath3 ] or as [ e.g.isovalent substitution in bafe@xmath3(as@xmath1p@xmath2)@xmath3 ] in bafe@xmath3as@xmath3 , as well as application of pressure @xcite , to this parent compound appear to be very similar .",
    "@xcite first , the temperature of structural and magnetic transitions decreases , then superconductivity emerges with a region of coexistence of superconductivity and antiferromagnetism . on further substitution ( or under higher pressure ) the magnetic and structural transitions are suppressed , the superconducting transition temperature passes through the maximum and gradually goes to zero , or to a small finite value as in the case of complete substitution of k for ba , in kfe@xmath3as@xmath3 .",
    "closer examination of the globally similar phase diagrams though , point to clear differences in details that allow to gain an insight into the complex physics of these materials @xcite .",
    "the results of two sets of measurements on a large , specific selection of samples will be discsussed below .",
    "the first set is comprised of the initial ( @xmath12 kbar ) pressure dependence of the superconducting transition temperature , @xmath13 .",
    "the second set consists of of the data on the evolution of the jump in temperature - dependent specific heat capacity at the superconducting transition , @xmath14 .",
    "measurement of @xmath0 under pressure is one of the traditional experiments performed on superconductors @xcite . at a minimum , such data allow for evaluation of possible equivalence of pressure and chemical substitution that was suggested for several 122 series @xcite . moreover , under favorable circumstances such a dataset can shed light or make conjectures on the details of the electronic structure and mechanism of superconductivity , like lifshitz transitions @xcite , pressure induced oxygen ordering effects , change of the symmetry of the superconducting pairing , or evolution of the superconducting gap structure @xcite .    the experimental data on the jump in specific heat capacity at the superconducting transition are usually analyzed in terms of @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is a normal state sommerfeld coefficient of the material . in the weak coupling bcs limit @xmath17 .",
    "this value can go as high as @xmath18 in the strong coupling limit @xcite .",
    "a lot of work was done on analysis of @xmath15 in the cases of anisotropic superconducting order parameter , multiband superconductivity , and superconducting materials with magnetic or with kondo impurities @xcite .",
    "such analysis becomes difficult if not impossible in the case of iron - based superconductors . whereas @xmath14 and @xmath0 are easy to measure ( in homogeneous samples ) , to evaluate normal state @xmath16 in superconductors , usually either specific heat capacity measurements are performed down to low temperatures in magnetic field in excess of ( upper ) critical field ( assuming that normal state @xmath16 does not depend on magnetic field ) , or different contributions to a zero field specific heat capacity are carefully analized at temperatures above @xmath0 and the electronic normal state contribution is separated . since superconducting transition temperatures and upper critical fields in the iron - based superconductors are high @xcite , and ambiguous magnetic contribution to specific heat capacity is often present , a reliable evaluation of the normal state @xmath16 in these materials is difficult to achieve .    in lieu of reliable data on @xmath16 in fe - based superconductors ,",
    "an alternatime approach to analize specific heat capacity data emerged .",
    "it was observed that many fe - based 122 superonductors follow the empirical trend , suggested in ref . and expanded in refs .",
    ", the so - called bnc scaling , @xmath6 .",
    "it was proposed ( even if on a limited dataset ) that for elemental superconductors , and representative a-15 and heavy fermion compounds @xmath19 scaling with different , @xmath20 , takes place @xcite .",
    "several theoretical models were used to explain the bnc scaling in iron - pnictides .",
    "the @xmath6 behavior is expected for a quantum critical metal undergoing a pairing instability @xcite ; in the limit of strong pair - breaking within bcs theory for @xmath21- or @xmath22- symmetry of the superconducting gap @xcite ; or as a result of an interplay between superconductivity and magnetism @xcite . rather than discussing _",
    "pro et contra _ arguments for different theories , here we will treat the bnc scaling as an experimental observation valid for many fe - as superconductor , with no association with one or another specific theoretical paradigm",
    ".    two families that will be briefly discussed here are ba@xmath1k@xmath2fe@xmath3as@xmath3 and ba@xmath1na@xmath2fe@xmath3as@xmath3 . in both cases",
    "the alkali metal substitution in place of ba provides hole - doping to the system .",
    "it was described @xcite that the average structural changes in the feas layers of ba@xmath1_a_@xmath2fe@xmath3as@xmath3 ( _ a _ = alkali metal ) are independent of the average radius of the alkal metal cation _ a _ and the mismatch in radii between the alkaline earth and alkali metal cations , and result from decreasing the electron count . a quantitative similarity between the evolution of the competing antiferromagnetic order and superconductivity in the ba@xmath1k@xmath2fe@xmath3as@xmath3 and ba@xmath1na@xmath2fe@xmath3as@xmath3 series was reported .",

    "synthesis of homogeneous single crystals with finely controlled na concentration around 20 - 30% and further comprehensive measurements of superconducting and magnetic properties ( and their interplay ) , including studies of the symmetry of the superconducting state , in this range of concentrations would be desirable to understand the distinct properties of the ba@xmath1na@xmath2fe@xmath3as@xmath3 series .    a related , ba@xmath1rb@xmath2fe@xmath3as@xmath3 family , was reported @xcite to have the _ x - t _ phase diagram similar that of ba@xmath1k@xmath2fe@xmath3as@xmath3 .",
    "the rbfe@xmath3as@xmath3 end - member is known to be a superconductor , rb - concentration dependence of the lattice parameters are close to linear , at this moment no @xmath39 or any other unusual phase is discovered .",
    "this allows us to speculate that the details of the evolution of the fermi surface and the superconducting state should be very similar to those for the ba@xmath1rb@xmath2fe@xmath3as@xmath3 series .",
    "since the samples covering the whole concentration range exist at this moment only in a polycrystalline form , measurements of @xmath0 under pressure and of the evolution of the jump in specific heat capacity could be a good start , and will probably be done at some point .",
    "last , but not the least , this this short overview was focused on just two , reasonably simple , types of measurements probing a superconducting state .",
