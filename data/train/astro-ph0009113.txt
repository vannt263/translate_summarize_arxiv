    "this issue got impetus after the explosion of sn 1987a .",
    "one of the revealing features of sn 1987a is that a neutrino was observed in kamiokande ii at the twelveth second .",
    "so far there has been no observation of a pulsar within it .",
    "moreover , the light curve fades away leading to the speculation that the compact object in sn 1987a has collapsed into a low mass black hole . if this picture of low mass black hole formation is true for sn 1987a , the newly born hot and neutrino rich star , called protoneutron star , was stable over twelve seconds or more before collapsing into a black hole .    in recent years",
    ", there have been several works by various groups @xcite to understand what is the mechanism behind the stability of protoneutron stars for short times . in the `` conventional '' scenario where ( proto)neutron stars are made up of nucleons and leptons ,",
    "the protoneutron star has a slightly smaller maximum mass than that of the neutron star .",
    "the `` window '' of maximum masses is very small in this case .",
    "however , the scenario dramatically changes with the formation of @xmath1 condensation in dense matter as found in previous calculations @xcite .",
    "they showed that leptons could stabilize much larger maximum mass for a protoneutron star in the presence of @xmath1 condensation during the evolution . in the following paragraph",
    ", we briefly review the previous calculations of @xmath1 condensation in dense matter relevant to ( proto)neutron stars .    with the pioneering work of kaplan and nelson @xcite ,",
    "a considerable interest has been generated in the study of antikaon ( @xmath3 ) condensation in dense matter in recent years . in a chiral @xmath4 model , baryons directly couples with ( anti)kaons .",
    "the effective mass @xmath5 of antikaons decreases with density because of the strongly attractive @xmath1-baryon interaction in dense matter .",
    "the in - medium energy ( @xmath6 ) of @xmath1 meson in the zero momentum state also decreases with density . the @xmath7-wave @xmath1 condensation sets in when @xmath6 equals to the chemical potential of @xmath1 meson .",
    "later , this chiral model was adopted by other groups to study @xmath1 condensation in the core of neutron stars @xcite using kaon - nucleon scattering data @xcite and @xmath1 atomic data @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath1 condensation has been studied in a different kind of model which is an extension of the walecka model @xcite . in this model , kaons interact with baryons through the exchange of mesons .",
    "it is found that the threshold density of @xmath1 condensation in various calculations depends on the equation of state and parameters , in particular on the antikaon optical potential .",
    "the net effect of @xmath1 condensation in neutron star matter is that @xmath1 condensate replaces electrons in maintaining charge neutrality and softens the equation of state . due to the softening of the equation of state ,",
    "the masses of the stars are reduced in the presence of @xmath1 condensate @xcite .",
    "it was also found that in the presence of hyperons , @xmath1 condensation was delayed to higher density and might not even exist in the maximum mass stars .",
    "protoneutron stars with @xmath1 condensate were studied by various groups @xcite and shown to have maximum masses larger than those of cold neutron stars - a reversal from the `` conventional scenario '' .",
    "the theoretical studies based on the above mentioned models @xcite and also on nambu@xmath8jona - lasinio model @xcite , yield a repulsive optical potential for @xmath9 in nuclear medium .",
    "therefore , @xmath9 condensation may not be a possibility in ( proto)neutron stars .",
    "in a recent calculation @xcite , the formation of @xmath0-meson condensation in neutron stars has been investigated within a relativistic mean field approach @xcite where the interaction between the baryons and antikaons are generated by the exchange of @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 mesons .",
    "it is found that the @xmath12-meson field is repulsive for @xmath1 meson , whereas it is attractive for @xmath0 meson which is an isodoublet partner of @xmath1 meson .",
    "the in - medium energy ( @xmath13 ) of @xmath0 meson is lowered compared with that of @xmath1 meson thereby making @xmath0 meson condensation more favorable in neutron star matter . the critical density for @xmath7-wave neutral @xmath0 meson condensation",
    "is governed by the condition @xmath14 .",
    "it was found that the critical densities for @xmath1 and @xmath0 condensation depended sensitively on the choice of the antikaon optical potential depth and more strongly on the nuclear equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "the threshold density of @xmath0 condensation always lie above that of @xmath1 condensation . with the appearance of @xmath1 and @xmath0 condensate ,",
    "the overall equation of state becomes softer than the situation without antikaon condensation leading to a reduction in the maximum masses of neutron stars .",
    "with the onset of only @xmath1 condensation , the proton fraction rises dramatically and even crosses the neutron fraction at some density because of charge neutrality . with the onset of @xmath0 condensation",
    ", there is a competition in the formation of @xmath15 and @xmath16 pairs resulting in a perfectly symmetric matter for nucleons and antikaons inside neutron stars . in the presence of hyperons",
    ", it was found that the formation of antikaon condensation was delayed to higher densities and the maximum mass neutron star contained @xmath0 condensate for larger values of the antikaon potential depth @xcite .",
    "so far , there is no calculation of @xmath0 condensation and its impact on the gross properties of protoneutron stars . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the effect of antikaon condensation with emphasis on the role of @xmath0 condensate to determine the composition and structure of protoneutron stars in the standard meson exchange model @xcite . in this calculation",
    ", we adopt the usual relativistic mean field lagrangian @xcite for baryons interacting via meson exchanges .",
    "also , we include the self - interaction of the scalar meson and the nonlinear @xmath11 meson term in the calculation @xcite .",
    "( anti)kaon - baryon interaction is treated on the same footing as the baryon - baryon interaction . the lagrangian density for ( anti)kaons is taken from ref .",
    "we shall show within this model that @xmath0 condensate may also exist inside a protoneutron star and has a significant influence on the star s properties and evolution .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) model of strong interactions .",
    "the relevant equations for ( proto)neutron star matter with antikaon condensates are summarized in this model . in section",
    "iii the parameters of the model are discussed and results of antikaon condensates in ( proto)neutron star matter are presented .",
    "section iv is devoted to the summary and conclusions .",
    "we describe the charge neutral and beta - equilibrated matter consisting of baryons , electrons , muons and electron type neutrinos in the presence of antikaon condensates .",
    "the starting point in the present approach is a relativistic field theoretical model of baryons and ( anti)kaons interacting by the exchange of scalar @xmath10 , isoscalar vector @xmath11 , and vector isovector @xmath12 mesons and two additional hidden - strangeness mesons , the scalar meson @xmath17(975 ) ( denoted hereafter as @xmath18 ) and the vector meson @xmath19(1020 ) to allow for hyperon - hyperon interaction @xcite .",
    "the total lagrangian density consists of the baryonic , kaonic and leptonic parts , i.e. @xmath20 , here we consider all the species of the baryon octet @xmath21 .",
    "the baryonic lagrangian density is given by @xmath22 here @xmath23 denotes the dirac spinor for baryon b with vacuum mass @xmath24 and isospin operator @xmath25 .",
    "the scalar self - interaction term @xcite is , @xmath26 the lagrangian density ( @xmath27 ) responsible for hyperon - hyperon interaction is given by , @xmath28    the lagrangian density for ( anti)kaons in the minimal coupling scheme is given by @xcite @xmath29 where the covariant derivative @xmath30 .",
    "the isospin doublet for kaons is denoted by @xmath31 and that for antikaons is @xmath32 .",
    "the effective mass of ( anti)kaons in this minimal coupling scheme is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the bare kaon mass .",
    "in the mean field approximation ( mfa ) @xcite adopted here , the meson fields are replaced by their expectation values .",
    "only the time - like components of the vector fields , and the isospin 3-component of @xmath12-meson field have non - vanishing values in a uniform and static matter .",
    "the mean meson fields are denoted by @xmath10 , @xmath18 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the dispersion relation representing the in - medium energies of @xmath32 for @xmath7-wave ( @xmath38 ) condensation is given by @xmath39 where the isospin projection @xmath40 for the mesons @xmath1 ( @xmath8 sign ) and @xmath0 ( + sign ) are explicitly written in the expression . since the @xmath10 and @xmath11 fields generally increase with density and both the terms containing @xmath10 and @xmath11 fields in eq.(6 ) are attractive for antikaons , the in - medium energies of @xmath3 decrease in nuclear medium .",
    "on the other hand , in nucleon - only matter @xmath41 ( @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the proton and neutron densities ) is negative ; thus the @xmath12-meson field favors the formation of @xmath0 condensation over that of @xmath1 condensation . in hyperon matter , the repulsive @xmath19 meson term may delay the onset of antikaon condensation @xcite .",
    "the in - medium energies of kaons @xmath31 are given by , @xmath44 it is to be noted here that kaon condensation may be impossible in the neutron star matter because the @xmath11-meson term is repulsive for kaons and dominates over the attractive @xmath10-meson term at higher densities .",
    "however , the attractive @xmath19 meson term may decrease kaon energies in the presence of hyperons @xcite .",
    "the meson field equations in the presence of baryons and antikaon condensates are derived from eqs .",
    "( 1)-(4 ) as @xmath45 here the scalar and number density of baryon @xmath46 are respectively @xmath47 with effective baryonic mass @xmath48 , fermi momentum @xmath49 , spin @xmath50 , and isospin projection @xmath51 .",
    "note that for @xmath7-wave @xmath52 condensation , the scalar and vector densities of antikaons are same and those are given by @xcite @xmath53 the total energy density @xmath54 has contributions from baryons , leptons , and antikaons .",
    "the baryonic plus leptonic energy density is @xmath55 where @xmath56 goes over electrons and muons .",
    "the last term corresponds to the energy density of neutrinos as required in a protoneutron star matter .",
    "the energy density for antikaons is @xmath57 since antikaons form @xmath7-wave bose condensates , they do not directly contribute to the pressure so that the pressure is due to baryons and leptons only @xmath58 here , the last term is the contribution of neutrinos to the pressure .",
    "the pressure due to antikaons is contained entirely in the meson fields via their field equations ( 8)-(12 ) .    at the interior of ( proto)neutron stars , baryons are in chemical equilibrium under weak processes .",
    "therefore the chemical potentials of baryons and leptons are governed by the equilibrium conditions @xmath59 where @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 are respectively the chemical potentials of the ith baryon , neutrons , electrons , and neutrinos with @xmath64 and @xmath65 and @xmath66 are baryon and electric charge of ith baryon respectively . in neutron stars , electrons are converted to muons by @xmath67 when the electron chemical potential becomes equal to the muon mass .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath68 in a neutron star . on the other hand ,",
    "muons are absent in a protoneutron star . with the onset of @xmath3 condensation",
    ", various strangeness changing processes may occur in ( proto)neutron stars such as , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , where @xmath71 and @xmath72 denote the isospin doublets for nucleons and antikaons , respectively .",
    "the requirement of chemical equilibrium yields @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are respectively the chemical potentials of @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "the above conditions determine the onset of antikaon condensations in the neutrino trapped matter .",
    "when the effective energy of @xmath1 meson ( @xmath6 ) equals to its chemical potential ( @xmath74 ) which , in turn , is equal to @xmath76 , a @xmath1 condensate is formed .",
    "similarly , @xmath0 condensation is formed when its in - medium energy satisfies the condition @xmath77 .",
    "it is to be noted here that the neutrino chemical potential ( @xmath78 ) is zero for neutrino free case corresponding to neutron stars . for ( proto)neutron star matter",
    "we need to include also the charge neutrality condition , which in the presence of antikaon condensate is expressed as @xmath79 where @xmath66 and @xmath80 are the electric charge and density of ith baryon respectively .",
    "the other constraint in protoneutron stars is the number of leptons per baryon .",
    "gravitational core collapse calculations of massive stars indicate that the lepton fraction at the onset of trapping is @xmath81 and it is conserved on a dynamical time scale @xcite .",
    "in the effective field theoretic approach adopted here , we first consider nucleon - only matter where two distinct sets of coupling constants for nucleons and kaons associated with the exchange of @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 mesons are required .",
    "the nucleon - meson coupling constants generated by reproducing the nuclear matter saturation properties are taken from glendenning and moszkowski of ref .",
    "this set is referred to as gm1 and listed in table i.    now we determine the kaon - meson coupling constants . according to the quark model and isospin counting rule ,",
    "the vector coupling constants are given by @xmath82 the scalar coupling constant is obtained from the real part of the @xmath1 optical potential at normal nuclear matter density @xmath83 the negative sign in the vector meson potential is due to g - parity .",
    "the critical density of @xmath3 condensation should therefore strongly depend on the @xmath1 optical potential .",
    "it has been demonstrated in various calculations that antikaons feel an attractive potential in normal nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "the analysis of @xmath1 atomic data @xcite in a hybrid model comprising of the relativistic mean field approach in the nuclear interior and a phenomenological density dependent potential at low density , revealed that the real part of the antikaon optical potential could be as large as @xmath84 mev at normal nuclear matter density and repulsive at low density in accordance with the low density theorem . in the coupled channel calculation @xcite for antikaons ,",
    "the attractive antikaon potential depth was estimated to be @xmath85 mev , whereas the chirally motivated coupled channel approach predicted a depth of @xmath86 mev @xcite .",
    "the wide range of values of the antikaon potential depth as found in various calculations may be attributed to the different treatments of @xmath87-resonance which is considered to be an unstable @xmath88 bound state just below the @xmath89 threshold .",
    "therefore , we determine the @xmath90 coupling constant @xmath91 from a set of values of @xmath92 starting from @xmath93 mev to @xmath94 mev .",
    "this is listed in table ii for the set gm1 .",
    "since the @xmath11-meson potential for @xmath3 in this model is @xmath95 mev , a rather large sigma - kaon coupling constant of @xmath96 is required to reproduce a depth of @xmath94 mev .",
    "it is to be noted that for this large depth , the value of the scalar coupling is similar to the prediction in the simple quark model i.e. , @xmath97 . in an alternative approach",
    "the kaon - meson coupling constants were also determined from the @xmath7-wave kaon - nucleon ( @xmath98 ) scattering length @xcite .",
    "we now present results for ( proto)neutron star matter containing nucleons , leptons and @xmath3 condensates for the parameter set gm1 in tables i and ii . in figure 1 ,",
    "the scalar and vector potentials are displayed as a function of baryon density normalized to the equilibrium value of @xmath99 with the @xmath1 optical potential depth of @xmath100 mev for the neutrino free ( top panel ) and neutrino trapped ( bottom panel ) cases . in both cases ,",
    "the scalar ( @xmath10 ) and vector ( @xmath11 ) potentials increase with density before the onset of antikaon condensation . in the neutrino free case",
    ", two curves touch each other just at the onset of @xmath1 condensation , whereas the curve of the vector ( @xmath11 ) potential crosses the curve of the scalar potential before the appearance of antikaon condensation in the neutrino trapped case . after the formation of @xmath3 condensates , the curves change slope i.e. the rate of increase of the fields",
    "is altered with respect to the previous situations . with the appearance of @xmath0 condensate , the isovector potential approaches zero with increasing density in the neutrino free case , whereas it goes to zero and then bounces back for the neutrino trapped case .",
    "it is found that the scalar potential for the neutrino free matter becomes larger after the onset of antikaon condensation than that of the neutrino trapped matter .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( 8) and the reasoning that the onsets of @xmath3 condensation are delayed to higher densities in the neutrino trapped matter . though the vector potentials are comparable in both the cases up to @xmath101 , it is higher for the neutrino trapped case at higher densities . on the other hand , the isovector potential in the neutrino trapped matter is always smaller compared with that of the neutrino free matter .",
    "those variations in the meson fields may be attributed to the different behaviour of the source terms in the field equations of motion ( eqs .",
    "( 8),(10 ) and ( 12 ) ) and the composition of matter in two cases",
    ".    the effective mass ratio of antikaons , @xmath102 , are shown in figure 2 as a function of normalised baryon density for @xmath103 mev .",
    "the solid line represents the neutrino free case , whereas the dotted line denotes the neutrino trapped situation .",
    "it is found that the effective mass in the neutrino free matter is smaller than that of the neutrino trapped matter at higher densities .",
    "this may be attributed to the larger scalar potential at higher densities in the former case .",
    "figure 3 shows the s - wave antikaon condensation energies for the neutrino free and neutrino trapped nuclear matter as a function of baryon density .",
    "the calculation is done with the antikaon potential depth of @xmath103 mev .",
    "the solid lines correspond to the energy of @xmath1 meson , @xmath6 , whereas the dashed lines indicate that of @xmath0 meson , @xmath13 .",
    "also , the electron chemical potential ( @xmath62 ) for the neutrino free case and the difference between electron and neutrino chemical potentials , @xmath104 , for the neutrino trapped case in the absence of @xmath3 condensate are depicted in the figure . in the neutrino trapped matter , the in - medium energy of @xmath105 meson is lower compared with that of the neutrino free matter .",
    "this difference in the energies of @xmath105 meson stems from different behaviours of the meson fields in two cases as is evident from fig .",
    "1 . the threshold densities of @xmath105 condensation in the neutrino free and neutrino trapped matter are 2.43@xmath106 and 3.07@xmath106 , respectively . in the presence of trapped neutrinos ,",
    "the onset of @xmath105 condensation is shifted to higher density because the difference of electron and neutrino chemical potentials ( @xmath104 ) intersects the @xmath6 curve at higher density .",
    "on the other hand , the threshold condition for @xmath0 condensation is always @xmath107 .",
    "unlike the situation with @xmath1 meson , we find that the in - medium energy of @xmath0 meson in the neutrino trapped matter is higher than that of the neutrino free case .",
    "the threshold densities for @xmath0 condensation are 3.59@xmath106 and 3.81@xmath106 for the neutrino free and neutrino trapped matter , respectively .",
    "the early appearance of @xmath1 condensate delays the formation of @xmath0 condensate in the neutrino free(trapped ) matter to a higher density . due to the presence of neutrinos ,",
    "the shift in the threshold density of @xmath0 condensation is smaller with respect to the neutrino free case than the corresponding situation with @xmath105 condensation .",
    "we note that the difference between the energies of @xmath0 and @xmath105 in the neutrino trapped case is smaller than that of the neutrino free case because the isovector potential is smaller in the former case .",
    "threshold densities of @xmath3 condensation for the gm1 set and other values of @xmath92 are given in table iii .",
    "the values given in the parentheses correspond to the neutrino free matter .",
    "the populations of various particles in proto(neutron ) star matter with @xmath1 and @xmath0 condensation for @xmath103 mev are shown in figure 4 . in the top panel",
    "we exhibit the particle abundances of the neutrino free star matter . in the neutrino free matter , once @xmath1 condensate sets in at @xmath108 , it rapidly increases with density replacing the leptons in maintaining the charge neutrality .",
    "the proton density becomes equal to @xmath1 condensate density because of the charge neutrality . with the onset of @xmath0 condensate at 3.59@xmath106 ,",
    "the neutron and proton abundances become identical resulting in a symmetric matter of nucleons and antikaons @xcite . in the previous calculation of @xmath1 condensation in neutron star matter @xcite",
    ", it was found that protons were more abundant than neutrons at higher densities . in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "4 , we show the particle fractions with both @xmath1 and @xmath0 condensates for the neutrino trapped matter . we have a somewhat different picture here . with the formation of @xmath105 condensate at 3.07@xmath106 , it can not replace electrons totally like the neutrino free case because of the constraint @xmath109 in the system . at higher baryon densities",
    ", the electron density slowly falls and the density of @xmath105 condensate becomes higher than the electron density .",
    "as soon as @xmath0 condensate is formed at 3.81@xmath106 , the neutron density becomes equal to the proton density and it continues in the high density regime . like the neutrino free case ( top panel ) , the neutrino trapped matter becomes symmetric nuclear matter just with the formation of @xmath0 condensate . on the other hand ,",
    "the density of @xmath0 condensate increases with baryon density uninterruptedly and even becomes larger than the density of @xmath105 condensate beyond @xmath110 . as a result ,",
    "the @xmath12 meson field becomes zero at the onset of @xmath0 condensation and then bounces back ( see fig .",
    "1 ) unlike the situation in the neutrino free matter where the isovector field is zero at and beyond the onset of @xmath0 condensation .",
    "it is interesting to note that the beta equilibrated and charge neutral neutrino trapped matter is mainly dominated by @xmath0 condensate than @xmath105 condensate after the formation of @xmath0 condensate .",
    "the equation of state ( eos ) or the pressure ( @xmath111 ) versus energy density ( @xmath112 ) for the neutrino free and neutrino trapped matter is displayed in figure 5 .",
    "the top panel represents the nucleon - only matter . here ,",
    "the dashed line stands for the neutrino trapped case and the solid line implies the neutrino free case .",
    "the overall eos of the neutrino trapped matter is softer compared with that of the neutrino free matter .",
    "it is the delicate interplay of the contributions of the symmetry and lepton terms to the energy density ( pressure ) in both cases . as trapped neutrinos",
    "leave the system , the conversion of protons to neutrons increases the energy density ( pressure ) more than it is decreased by the loss of neutrinos .",
    "this scenario is changed in the presence of antikaon condensation .",
    "this is demonstrated in the bottom panel of fig . 5 with @xmath103 mev .",
    "we find that the overall eos of the neutrino trapped matter is now stiffer than that of the neutrino free matter . during deleptonization ,",
    "the contribution of the nuclear symmetry term to the energy density ( pressure ) does not change at all in this case with @xmath1 and @xmath0 condensate at higher densities .",
    "this happens because both the neutrino free and neutrino trapped matter become isospin saturated nuclear matter at the onset of @xmath0 condensation .",
    "such a situation does not arise for ( proto)neutron star matter with @xmath1 condensate because more protons than neutrons are favoured by @xmath105 condensate due to the charge neutrality .",
    "therefore , it is the lepton contribution which makes the difference between the eos of the neutrino free and neutrino trapped matter including both @xmath105 and @xmath0 condensate .",
    "it is important to note here that the incompressibility of matter ( @xmath113 ) becomes negative with the formation of @xmath3 condensates in the neutrino free matter as is evident from fig .",
    "5 . to get rid of those unphysical regions from the energy density versus pressure curve and maintain a positive incompressibility , the maxwell construction is done here .",
    "this implies a first order phase transition . we note that the phase transition is second order for lower values of the antikaon potential .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that the condensation of @xmath1 meson was treated as first order phase transition using gibbs criteria @xcite . in this case",
    ", the matter would have a normal phase of baryons and leptons at low density followed by a mixed phase of @xmath1 condensate and baryons and a pure phase of @xmath1 condensate at higher densities .",
    "this scenario would be more complicated with further appearance of @xmath0 condensate because @xmath1 and @xmath0 condensation have to be treated as two separate first order phase transitions .",
    "therefore , the treatment of such a problem is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "now we present the results of static structures of ( proto)neutron stars calculated using tolmann - oppenheimer - volkov ( tov ) equations .",
    "the static ( proto)neutron star sequences representing the stellar masses @xmath114 and the corresponding central energy density @xmath115 are shown in figure 6 for the gm1 set .",
    "the neutrino free stars are denoted by the solid lines and the neutrino trapped stars are represented by the dashed lines in fig .",
    "the `` conventional '' scenario i.e. stars made of nucleons , leptons and no @xmath3 condensation is shown in the top panel .",
    "the maximum masses ( @xmath116 ) and central densities ( @xmath117 ) of the neutrino trapped and neutrino free stars are respectively given by 2.283(2.364)@xmath118 and 5.84(5.63)@xmath106 .",
    "the protoneutron star has a smaller mass compared with that of the neutron star because the eos is softer in the former case . in the bottom panel ,",

    "this can be attributed to the softening of the eos due to the presence of @xmath3 condensates . in the previous calculations including @xmath1 condensate @xcite this kind of softening in the eos and reduction in the maximum mass of the star",
    "was observed .",
    "the net result of @xmath105 condensation is that the maximum mass stars contain more protons than neutrons at higher densities .",
    "brown and collaborators @xcite called those stars as `` nuclear matter '' stars rather than neutron stars . in the neutrino trapped case , the additional softening in the eos due to @xmath0 condensate results in a smaller maximum mass for the star compared with the corresponding situation with only @xmath105 condensate . in the bottom panel and table iii , we find that the threshold density of @xmath0 condensation for the neutrino trapped case lies well inside the central density of the maximum mass star .",
    "this implies that a significant region of the protoneutron star may contain @xmath0 condensate along with @xmath105 condensate . in the neutrino free case ,",
    "the threshold density of @xmath0 condensation coincides with the central density of the maximum mass star .",
    "it is interesting to note that the maximum mass stars in the presence of @xmath105 and @xmath0 condensate contain exactly equal number of protons and neutrons at higher densities .",

    "the nucleon - meson couplings of the tm1 set are shown in table i and @xmath91 couplings for various @xmath92 are given in table ii .",
    "now we present the results for the calculation of @xmath3 condensation in the neutrino trapped nucleon - only matter using the tm1 set .",
    "the critical densities of @xmath3 condensation , maximum masses of ( proto)neutron stars with their corresponding central densities for the tm1 set are shown in table iv .",
    "the values in the parentheses correspond to the neutrino free cases . because of the presence of the nonlinear @xmath11 meson term ,",
    "the tm1 set results in a softer eos than that with the gm1 set . as a result ,",
    "the critical densities of @xmath3 condensation for the tm1 set are shifted to higher densities compared with those of the gm1 set .",
    "it is found that @xmath0 condensation is formed inside the maximum mass neutron stars for @xmath120 mev and inside the maximum mass protoneutron star only for @xmath121 mev in the tm1 set .",
    "it is important to note that the phase transition is of second order for all values of the antikaon potential depth in the tm1 set @xcite .",
    "now we discuss the situations when hyperons are included in the calculation in addition to nucleons .",
    "it was noted earlier that the presence of hyperons delayed the onsets of @xmath3 condensation to much higher density @xcite . since the core of a ( proto)neutron star may be hyperon rich ,",
    "we include hyperon - hyperon interaction besides hyperon - nucleon interaction in our calculation .",
    "this is accounted by considering two additional hidden - strangeness mesons - the scalar meson @xmath17(975 ) ( denoted by @xmath18 ) and the vector meson @xmath19(1020 ) .",
    "the vector coupling constants for hyperons are determined from the su(6 ) symmetry as , @xmath122 the scalar meson ( @xmath10 ) coupling to hyperons is obtained from the potential depth of a hyperon ( y ) in the saturated nuclear matter @xmath123 the analysis of energy levels in @xmath124-hypernuclei suggests a well depth of @xmath124 in symmetric matter @xmath125 mev @xcite . on the other hand , recent analysis of a few @xmath126-hypernuclei events predicts a @xmath126 well depth of @xmath127 mev @xcite .",
    "however , the situation for the @xmath128 potential in normal matter is very unclear .",
    "the only known bound @xmath128-hypernuclei is the light system @xmath129 @xcite .",
    "the most updated analysis of @xmath130 atomic data indicates a strong isoscalar repulsion in the @xmath128-nuclear matter interaction @xcite .",
    "therefore , we use a repulsive @xmath128 well depth of @xmath131 mev @xcite in our calculation .",
    "the @xmath18-y coupling constants are obtained by fitting them to a well depth , @xmath132 , for a hyperon ( y ) in a hyperon ( @xmath133 ) matter at nuclear saturation density @xcite .",

    "switching off y - y interactions and antikaon condensation , we study the neutrino free(trapped ) hyperon matter for the gm1 and tm1 set and for the above choices of hyperon - nucleon coupling constants . here , we find that @xmath124 hyperon is the first strange baryon to appear in the neutrino free(trapped ) matter .",
    "it is closely followed by @xmath138 hyperons . because of the repulsive @xmath128-nucleon interaction , @xmath128 hyperons do not appear in the systems . with the appearance of hyperons , equations of state in the neutrino free(trapped ) matter",

    "the values in the parentheses correspond to the neutrino free cases . like the situations with antikaon condensates in the neutrino free(trapped ) nucleon - only matter , the maximum mass in the neutrino trapped hyperon matter is larger than that of the corresponding neutrino free case as found in the previous calculations @xcite",
    ".    now we study the formation of antikaon condensation in neutrino free(trapped ) matter including hyperon - hyperon interaction for the gm1 set .",
    "earlier we have found that a softer eos shifts the threshold densities of antikaon condensations to higher densities . also , the presence of hyperons which make the eos softer , delays the onsets of @xmath3 condensation to higher densities @xcite . in this case , we find that antikaon condensations do not occur even at densities as large as 7.5@xmath106 in the neutrino free(trapped ) hyperon matter for @xmath139 mev .",

    "the @xmath128s are excluded from the systems because of the repulsive @xmath128-nucleon interaction .",
    "on the other hand , the early appearance of @xmath1 condensation in the neutrino free(trapped ) matter suppresses the appearance of @xmath138 hyperons because it is energetically favourable for @xmath1 condensate to maintain charge neutrality in the systems .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that @xmath3 condensates play more dominant role than hyperons in determining various properties of the ( proto)neutron stars in this case .    in figure 8",
    ", we display the eos ( p vs. @xmath112 ) in the top panel and the mass sequence of the ( proto)neutron stars in the bottom panel for the gm1 set and @xmath100 mev .",
    "the neutrino trapped matter has a stiffer eos than that of the corresponding neutrino free matter .",
    "the maximum masses and their central densities for the neutrino free(trapped ) cases are 1.57(1.98)@xmath118 and 4.48(5.24)@xmath106 respectively .",
    "the delayed neutrino emission and the possible black hole formation in the context of sn 1987a had been extensively discussed by bethe and brown @xcite . assuming sn 1987a has collapsed into a black hole , bethe and brown estimated the gravitational mass for the compact remnant in it to be 1.56@xmath118 from the ni production .",
    "this maximum mass of the cold compact object is known as the bethe - brown limit @xcite .",
    "they argued that progenitor stars having masses in the range 18 - 30 @xmath118 would first explode as supernovae and later the compact objects go into low mass black holes returning matter to the galaxy @xcite .    in the previous studies @xcite",
    ", it was shown that the protoneutron stars become unstable after deleptonization and cooling .",
    "the metastability occurs when exotic matter such as hyperons or antikaon condensates appears during the evolution of the protoneutron stars .",
    "bethe - brown exploited the idea of the formation of @xmath105 condensation in dense nuclear matter @xcite to understand the metastability of the compact object during the evolution of the protoneutron stars to low mass black holes . in the `` conventional '' scenario without antikaon condensation or hyperons , the `` window ''",
    "i.e. the difference of the maximum masses in the neutrino free and neutrino trapped matter consisting of nucleons is small .",
    "later it was shown that the inclusion of thermal pressure could raise the maximum mass of the protoneutron star slightly above that of the neutron star @xcite .",
    "however , there is a different scenario with @xmath105 condensation as noted by various authors @xcite .",
    "they found that mostly the lepton pressure could stabilize larger mass in the neutrino trapped case during the evolution . in our calculation with nucleons , leptons and @xmath105 condensation , the `` window '' is @xmath140 for the gm1 set and the antikaon potential depth of -160 mev . with further inclusion of @xmath0 condensate ,",
    "the high density matter contains exactly as many protons as neutrons . as a result ,",
    "the high density matter remains the symmetric nuclear matter even after the deleptonization and cooling . in the presence of both the condensates , it is exactly the lepton pressure which stabilizes larger maximum mass of the protoneutron star for short times . in this case",
    ", we obtain the maximum mass window of @xmath141 . in our model calculation with the gm1 set and the antikaon potential of @xmath100 mev , the protoneutron stars consisting of nucleons , leptons and @xmath1 and @xmath0 condensate have a maximum mass @xmath142 which could be stable during the deleptonization and cooling . as the trapped neutrinos leave the system , the lepton pressure in the core decreases . at the same time",
    ", the core of the nascent star is heated up and attains a higher value of entropy @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been shown by pons et al .",
    "@xcite that this thermal effect on the maximum mass is comparable to that of the trapped neutrinos . as a consequence ,",
    "the compact object would be stable for much longer duration .",
    "the inclusion of the thermal pressure in the calculation would again stabilize an additional mass of @xmath143 . as the system cools down , the compact object with a maximum mass @xmath142 which would be stable for short times in our calculation , is larger than that of the stable cold mass and the bethe - brown limit ( 1.56 @xmath118 )",
    ". consequently , it would collapse into a low mass black hole .",
    "we retain the same qualitative feature of the metastability of the protoneutron stars including hyperons along with antikaon condensation .",
    "we have studied antikaon condensation putting emphasis on the formation of @xmath0 condensation in the neutrino trapped nuclear and hyperon matter within the relativistic mean field models .",
    "the baryon - baryon and ( anti)kaon - baryon interactions are treated on the same footing in this work .",
    "those interactions are mediated by the exchange of mesons .",
    "two different model lagrangians are adopted in this calculation . the model lagrangian which contains the scalar self - interaction term ,",
    "is characterised by the gm1 parameter set .",
    "besides the scalar self - interaction term , the other model lagrangian includes the non - linear @xmath11 meson term and the corresponding parameter set is denoted by the tm1 set .",
    "it is found that the threshold densities of antikaon condensations are sensitive to the equation of state and the antikaon potential in normal nuclear matter .",
    "the calculations performed with the gm1 and tm1 set show that @xmath1 condensation always happens earlier than @xmath0 condensation .",
    "the threshold densities of @xmath3 condensation in the tm1 set are higher than those of the gm1 set because the equation of state is softer in the former case .",
    "it is found that the threshold densities of antikaon condensation in the neutrino trapped nucleon - only matter are higher than those of the corresponding neutrino free case . in the presence of neutrinos ,",
    "the shift in the threshold density of @xmath1 condensation with respect to the neutrino free case is higher than that of @xmath0 condensation .    with the onset of @xmath0 condensation ,",
    "abundances of neutrons and protons become equal and the density of @xmath0 condensate increases rapidly and becomes larger than that of @xmath1 condensate in the neutrino trapped nuclear matter . on the contrary , the neutrino free nuclear matter is not only symmetric in neutrons and protons but also in @xmath1 and @xmath0 mesons at high density . therefore , it is possible that @xmath0 condensate in the neutrino trapped matter would play a dominant role over @xmath1 condensate at higher densities .",
    "unlike the situation in the neutrino free nuclear matter , @xmath1 mesons in the condensate replace electrons partially in the neutrino trapped matter because of the lepton number constraint in the system .",
    "the presence of @xmath1 and @xmath0 condensate in the neutrino trapped nuclear matter makes the overall equation of state softer compared with the situation without antikaon condensate .",
    "we find that @xmath0 condensate is formed well inside the maximum mass protoneutron stars for higher values of the antikaon potential in the calculation using the tm1 set . on the other hand ,",
    "the calculation with the gm1 set implies that @xmath0 condensate occupies a significant region of the maximum mass stars for rather smaller values of the antikaon potential . in the presence of hyperons ,",
    "antikaon condensate is formed for large values of @xmath144 mev in the gm1 set . in this case",
    ", it is found that only @xmath124 hyperons appear in the neutrino free(trapped ) hyperon matter .",
    "therefore @xmath1 and @xmath0 condensate may play the most dominant role in determining various gross properties of ( proto)neutron stars than hyperons .",
    "we have revisited the scenario of the metastability of protoneutron stars and their evolution to low mass black holes in the context of the calculation of @xmath0 condensation along with @xmath1 condensation in the neutrino free(trapped ) nuclear and hyperon matter .",
    "it is found that the maximum mass of a protoneutron star is larger than that of the corresponding neutron star and also the bethe - brown limit of @xmath145 for a neutron star .",
    "therefore , the protoneutron star would be stable during the deleptonization and cooling and later it may collapse into a low mass black hole .",
