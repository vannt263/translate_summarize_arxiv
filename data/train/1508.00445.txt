    "gauge mediated supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking ( gmsb )  @xcite is very attractive , since it is free from the flavor - changing neutral current problem in the susy standard model , which is a serious obstacle for the low - energy susy .",
    "more interestingly , most of the physical observables are predicted within the framework of renormalizable field theories , once a model of messenger multiplets are specified .",
    "in fact , the spectrum of susy particles is unambiguously calculated using the number of messengers and their susy invariant masses and susy breaking @xmath4-terms in a minimal gmsb .",
    "furthermore , it has been pointed out that a focus point behavior  @xcite is realized in the minimal gmsb if the numbers of @xmath5 doublet messengers @xmath6 and @xmath7 triplet messengers @xmath8 have certain values  @xcite   ( see also @xcite for an earlier work ) .",
    "it turns out that the ratio of @xmath6 to @xmath8 is always close to 5/2 .",
    "the focus point enables us to explain the origin of the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) scale even when the masses of the susy particles are multi - tev .",
    "therefore , it is one of the important directions for the susy , after the discovery of the higgs boson with a mass around 125 gev  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the explanation of the observed higgs boson mass requires large radiative corrections  @xcite : it is indicated that stops are at least heavier than 3 - 4 tev  @xcite , if their trilinear coupling has a moderate value .    in this paper",
    ", we show that the required ratio ( @xmath9 ) for the focus point susy in the minimal gmsb is indeed fixed by the product group unification  @xcite . in the product group unification ,",
    "the doublet - triplet splitting problem and the rapid proton decay problem , which are very severe in the minimal @xmath3 grand unified theory ( gut ) , are easily solved .",
    "we show that the messenger numbers are fixed to be @xmath10 and the widely known fine - tuning measure @xmath11  @xcite is small as @xmath11=70 - 130 for the observed higgs boson mass @xmath12 125 gev .",
    "moreover , we point out the gravitino can be a dark matter with a high reheating temperature while avoiding the over - closure of the universe .",
    "thanks to this high reheating temperature , a sufficient baryon number is easily produced via the leptogenesis  @xcite .",
    "in the focus point susy , the fine - tuning of the ewsb scale is significantly milder than the naive expectation due to a special relation among soft susy breaking masses : even if the mass scale of the susy particles is much larger than the ewsb scale @xmath13 gev , the radiatively generated soft mass for the up - type higgs is naturally close to the observed ewsb scale . among the focus point",
    "susy scenarios , the present focus point gmsb is especially attractive , since the focus point behavior is controlled only by the number of messenger particles .      in the focus point gauge mediation ,",
    "the required relation among the susy breaking masses to relax the fine - tuning is obtained for @xmath9 , where @xmath6 and @xmath8 are the numbers of the @xmath5 doublet messengers and @xmath7 triplet messengers , respectively . to see this ,",
    "let us show the ewsb conditions and how the relevant mass parameters in the higgs potential are written in terms of the soft mass parameters at the high energy scale .",
    "the ewsb scale and the ratio of the higgs vevs ( @xmath14 ) are determined by the stationary conditions of the higgs potential : @xmath15 v^2 & \\simeq & -\\mu^2 - \\frac{(m_{h_u}^2 + \\frac{1}{2v_u}\\frac{\\partial \\delta v}{\\partial   v_u } ) \\tan^2\\beta - ( m_{h_d}^2 + \\frac{1}{2v_d}\\frac{\\partial   \\delta v}{\\partial   v_d})}{\\tan^2\\beta-1 } \\bigr|_{m_{ir } } , \\nonumber \\\\ b_\\mu ( \\tan\\beta + \\cot \\beta ) & \\simeq &   m_{h_d}^2 + \\frac{1}{2v_d}\\frac{\\partial   \\delta v}{\\partial   v_d } + m_{h_u}^2 + \\frac{1}{2v_u}\\frac{\\partial   \\delta v}{\\partial   v_u } + 2\\mu^2 \\bigr|_{m_{ir}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is taken to be the stop mass scale , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are gauge coupling constants for @xmath20 ( in the @xmath3 gut normalization ) and @xmath5 , respectively , and @xmath21 is a one - loop effective potential .",
    "the soft susy breaking mass for the up - type ( down - type ) higgs is denoted by @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) . including @xmath21 is important to evaluate the fine - tuning for the large stop mass , and it may even be the dominant source of the fine - tuning required to obtain the observed ewsb scale . for large @xmath24 , which is preferred to enhance the higgs boson mass",
    ", @xmath25 is important to determine the ewsb scale @xmath26 .    with this in mind",

    "all soft susy breaking masses for the mssm particles are generated from messenger loops at the messenger scale @xmath49 ( see appendix [ sec : mgmsb ] for details ) .",

    "finally , the gravitino dark matter is discussed .",
    "we show that the gravitino can be dark matter without spoiling the success of the thermal leptogenesis .    in gauge mediation models ,",
    "the gravitino is the lightest susy particle and a dark matter candidate .",
    "the abundance of the gravitino can be estimated for different two cases : @xmath92 and @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the reheating temperature and @xmath95 is the freeze - out temperature of the gravitino , @xmath96    if the reheating temperature is smaller than @xmath95 , the gravitino is produced mainly from the thermal scattering and the decay of superparticles@xcite . in this case ,",
    "numerical analysis shows us that the reheating temperature should be lower than about @xmath97gev@xmath98tev in order that gravitino does not overclose the universe@xcite",
    ".    the second case , @xmath92 , may be more attractive since the observed baryon number is explained by the thermal leptogenesis@xcite . with this high reheating temperature ,",
    "the gravitino is thermalized and the relic abundance is estimated as @xmath99 which does not depend on @xmath94 .",
    "therefore , for @xmath100 , if we obtain a dilution factor , @xmath101 , from the extra entropy production , the observed dark matter abundance is explained .",
    "this dilutes the baryon asymmetry as well , but that generated by the thermal leptogenesis can be large enough as discussed later . the significant entropy production may occur for @xmath102@xcite . provided that the decay temperature of the messenger @xmath103 is sufficiently small ,  ] where @xmath104 is the number density of the messengers divided by the entropy density .",
    "hence , @xmath105 is required . ]",
    "the energy density of the messenger once dominates the energy density of the universe after the gravitino is freeze - out .",
    "then , it decays via the superpotential :   and @xmath106 .",
    "however , the former becomes @xmath107 after the khler transformation , which leads to a very small decay width and , because of the equation of the motion , the latter is equivalent to eq.([eq : messdecay ] ) with the down - type yukawa suppression .",
    "] @xmath108 the decay of the octet messenger @xmath109 is suppressed by the colored higgs mass , and , we thus assume it is heavier than the reheating temperature and not created , so that we hereafter consider the decays of the @xmath110 charged messengers , @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 . in the following ,",
    "we calculate the scalar messenger decay .",
    "note that we have to take into account not only the interaction with fermions arising sorely from @xmath114 , but also the @xmath58-term potential involving the effective mass term of @xmath86 .",
    "the total decay width is @xmath115 the dilution factor is estimated as @xmath116 where @xmath117 and @xmath118 is the entropy density after or before the messenger decay , respectively , and @xmath103 is the decay temperature : @xmath119 thus , @xmath120 can be written as follows . @xmath121",
    "the gravitino abundance is the following : @xmath122 here , one can see that the observed relic abundance @xmath123 is naturally achieved without significant tuning .",
    "it is emphasized that the abundance of the gravitino no longer depends on the reheating temperature as long as the messengers were once in the thermal bath .",
    "the sufficient baryon number can be produced thorough the leptogenesis for @xmath124 gev  @xcite and @xmath125 , where @xmath126 is the mass of the right - handed neutrino .     for @xmath127 , where the absence of the susy cp - problem is promised .",

    "we have proposed a focus point gauge mediation model based on the product group unification .",
    "it has been shown that the observed higgs boson mass around 125 gev is explained with a mild fine - tuning @xmath12970 - 130 , an order of magnitude improvement over the minimal gauge mediation models .",
    "in addition , the focus point naturally appears from in the pgu if the messenger field is an adjoint representation of @xmath3 gauge group ; unlike other focus point gauge mediation models , we do not need to choose the continuous parameters , which control the focus point behavior .",
    "this enables our scenario to be very predictive . on the cosmological aspect",
    ", the gravitino can be dark matter without spoiling the success of the thermal leptogenesis .",
    "the observed baryon number of the universe is easily explained without the overproduction of the gravitino .",
    "it should be noted that the susy cp - problem is solved in our framework with the vanishing higgs @xmath4-term at the messenger scale . in this case , all arguments of @xmath57-terms , gaugino masses and higgs @xmath4-term are aligned to @xmath130 , .",
    "this may give sizable contributions to electric dipole moments of leptons and quarks  @xcite . ] and hence , no dangerous cp - violating phases arise .",
    "predicted values of @xmath131 are around 20 - 40 , depending on the messenger scale and the size of @xmath60 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cpsafe ] .    an unfortunate consequence of our model is that the masses of the susy particles are rather heavy , and it may be challenging to test it at the lhc , even with the high luminosity running . however , the relevant region with a mild fine - tuning is expected to be covered by the high energy upgrade of the lhc to 33tev  @xcite .",
    "the higgsino is always the next - lightest supersymmetric particle beyond the gravitino , and can be lighter than 500gev . therefore , it may be a target at the future @xmath132 linear collider experiments , such as ilc and clic .",
    "finally , let us comment on the proton decay , which can be a probe of our scenario . in the pgu ,",
    "the colored higgs multiplets are heavy without a difficulty , and hence , induced dimension five proton decay can be suppressed . on the other hand , for the dimension six proton decay induced by @xmath111 and @xmath83 gauge bosons",
    ", the decay rate of the proton can be ten times larger than that in the mssm without any extra - particles  @xcite .",
    "this is because we have the messenger field with a large representation of @xmath3 , contributing the beta - functions of the standard model gauge couplings .",
    "therefore , the @xmath3 gauge coupling constant is larger than that of the standard susy gut .",
    "thus , the dimension six proton decay , in particular the @xmath133 mode , is a good target at the proposed hyper - kamiokande experiment @xcite .",

    "<S> we propose a focus point gauge mediation model based on the product group unification ( pgu ) , which solves the doublet - triplet splitting problem of the higgs multiplets . in the focus point gauge mediation , </S>",
    "<S> the electroweak symmetry breaking scale can be naturally explained even for multi - tev stops . </S>",
    "<S> it is known that the focus point behavior appears if a ratio of the number of @xmath0 doublet messengers to that of @xmath1 triplet messengers is close to @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , this ratio ( effectively ) appears in our scenario based on the pgu , if the messenger field is an adjoint representation of @xmath3 gauge group . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , our focus point scenario is very predictive . </S>",
    "<S> it is also pointed out the gravitino can be dark matter without spoiling the success of the thermal leptogenesis . </S>",
    "<S> the absence of the susy cp - problem is guaranteed in the case that the higgs @xmath4-term vanishes at the messenger scale . </S>"
