    "the time evolution of disease spread within human populations is a very interesting and multifaceted topic ; it is closely related to the rate of new infections in a population , which has significant implications when designing public health policy .",
    "the spread of disease within a population is complex and depends on a number of different factors , including , social connectivity patterns , cultural practices and education surrounding hygiene and intervention strategies , the level of preexisting immunity and finally , the infectivity of the infectious agent . in order to produce a reliable estimate of the new infection rate",
    ", a model should incorporate - at the very least - the abovementioned factors .",
    "the spread of disease in a population involves a complex stochastic branching process .",
    "this process is comprised of three distinct constituents , namely , the stochastic phase , exponential phase and declining phase . to date , each phase has undergone a considerable amount of scrutiny using two main techniques , i.e. , compartmental and network models .",
    "the stochastic phase was studied using discrete and continuous time approaches @xcite , while the exponential and declining phases were studied using a variety of models and techniques , including , compartmental @xcite and network models @xcite . both of these method , however , have their downfalls ; that is , compartmental models deal solely with constant infection and removal rates , do not incorporate any memory of infections , distribute the force of infection uniformly in the population , and include the finite size effect in a very simple manner .",
    "moreover , some of the limitations associated with network methods are seen in the work by nel _",
    "@xcite and davoudi _ et.al _",
    "they considered disease transmission to follow the generation time concept , that is , they assumed infection or recovery / removal occurred at a discrete time within the period of @xmath0 .",
    "this led to a significant simplification of the calculations , thus , the model became unrealistic for a disease with a long period of infection .",
    "the work by volz",
    "@xcite included the finite size effect in a comprehensive manner , but the method could not accommodate diseases with a complex infection profile . to circumvent these downfalls",
    "we present a new methodology which can sustain complex infection and recovery / removal profiles , and can take the finite size effect into account , in a precise manner .",
    "below , we first discuss the required theoretical components for this methodology .",
    "we then compare theoretical results against simulation results to understand the precision of the method and the level of approximation involved .",
    "subsequently , we discuss the possibility of extending this current methodology to address systems with a complex dynamic network structure .",
    "we consider the preexisting contact network to be the platform for disease transmission within a population .",
    "individuals are represented by a vertex and contact between two individuals is represented by a link .",
    "links are composed of two stubs , each of which is attached to its own vertex . for a population of size @xmath1 , we create a random network where the degree of connectivity between vertices is coded by the probability distribution function , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the degree .",
    "the average excess degree@xcite is defined as the degree of secondarily infected vertices and is given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the average degree , @xmath6 and finally @xmath7 .",
    "the process of disease transmission within a population is a complex phenomenon .",
    "individuals , or vertices , are infected and removed at specific times , denoted by @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively .",
    "infected vertices are removed from the population for a number of reasons , including death , quarantine , and recovery for example . moreover ,",
    "the age of infection and the time between infection and removal , or the `` time - to - removal'',for each infected vertex are defined as @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "the transmission of infection between an infected vertex and a susceptible vertex is dictated by the infectivity function , @xmath12 , in which @xmath13 denotes the probability of transmission during the interval @xmath0 and @xmath14 . in the same manner",
    ", we define the removal function as @xmath15 , in which @xmath16 yields the chance of removal of an infected vertex during the interval @xmath0 and @xmath14 .",
    "the transmissibility , @xmath17 , provides the probability of transmission until time @xmath0 , for an infected vertex that is removed after time @xmath18 and satisfies the following equation@xcite @xmath19    we define @xmath20@xcite as the probability that a vertex has a time - to - removal @xmath21 , which is given by @xmath22 subject to the condition @xmath23 .",
    "we also define the probability density function as @xmath24 ( or @xmath25 ) .",
    "the basic reproduction number is given by @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the ultimate transmissibility @xmath28@xcite .",
    "finally , @xmath29 denotes the rate of newly infected vertices at time @xmath30 . at a given time @xmath30 ,",
    "a fraction , @xmath31 , of infected vertices @xmath32 with the age of infection @xmath0 remain infectious .",
    "therefore , the total number of infectious vertices , at a given time , can be calculated by @xmath33 and the number of removed and susceptible vertices are given by @xmath34d\\tau,\\label{eq : nr}\\ ] ]    and@xmath35    respectively .      in the following section we introduce and discuss the set of equations we use to find the rate of new infections @xmath29 as a function of time .",
    "this calculation becomes possible once we combine the network aspects ( vertices connectivity ) with the disease status of each vertex .",
    "to elaborate , we start with one infectious vertex with excess degree @xmath36 , and assume that it was infected at time @xmath37 . with this knowledge , we then calculate the number of new infection that arose from this infected vertex , at the later time @xmath38 , using @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the contribution of each link to disease transmission between time @xmath0 and @xmath14 , given that the vertex was not removed by time @xmath30 ; the resulting contribution of @xmath36 link is given by @xmath41 .",
    "the equation above is then multiplied by @xmath31 in order to take the chance of removal into account",
    ". the total number of infections caused by the first infected vertex is given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the ultimate transmissibility , which yields the probability of infection along a link .",
    "equation can be easily extended to the initial phase of an epidemic , assuming that the excess degree of all vertices is the same . in general , the renewal equation for @xmath29 is as follows@xcite @xmath44 the right hand side of the above equation gives the total number of transmitting links @xmath45 at time @xmath30 , which leads to @xmath46 infections@xcite .",
    "equation , where @xmath47 , can be used before the finite size effect becomes important , which is a valid assumption while @xmath48 . in the limit @xmath49 , only a fraction of @xmath36 is used to connect the infected and susceptible vertices . an appropriate approximation for @xmath50",
    "is given below .",
    "@xmath50 is calculated in two steps .",
    "first , the typical degree of infected vertices is calculated during the process of disease transmission .",
    "second , an estimate of the average number of links an infected vertex - with an infectious period of @xmath0 - could have with susceptible vertices , at time @xmath30 , is made .",
    "the first step is easily preformed for a random network @xcite",
    ". a vertex is randomly picked and assigned to a collected class , while the probability that the chosen vertex has the degree @xmath3 is given by @xmath51 .",
    "the function argument shows the number of collected vertices .",
    "the degree distribution of the uncollected vertices is given by @xmath52 .",
    "the expected degree of the first collected vertex is @xmath53 and the average degree of the uncollected vertices is @xmath54 .",
    "a second vertex is then chosen by picking a random stub .",
    "the probability that the second vertex has degree @xmath3 is given by @xmath55 , the degree distribution of the collected vertices is calculated as follows @xmath56 and the degree distribution of the uncollected vertices is specified by @xmath57 . the probability that the @xmath58 chosen vertex has degree @xmath3 is @xmath59 and , in the same manner , the degree distributions of collected and uncollected vertices are given by @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the average degree of uncollected vertices after @xmath62 collections .",
    "we define @xmath63 as the average degree of collected vertices after @xmath62 collections .",
    "the latter equations take the following form in the continuous limit @xmath64 the average degree of infected vertices that are infected between time @xmath30 and @xmath65 is given by @xmath66\\tilde{z}(n_{r}(t)+n_{i}(t)+j(t)dt)-(n_{r}(t)+n_{i}(t))\\tilde{z}(n_{r}(t)+n_{i}(t))}{j(t)dt}\\\\   & = \\tilde{z}(n_{r}(t)+n_{i}(t))+[n_{r}(t)+n_{i}(t)]\\left.\\frac{d\\tilde{z}(n)}{dn}\\right|_{n = n_{r}(t)+n_{i}(t)}.\\label{eq : zj}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the same manner , we find that the average degree of removed @xmath67 , infectious @xmath68 , and susceptible classes @xmath69 with the following formulas , respectively @xmath70\\tilde{z}(n_{r}(t)+n_{i}(t))-n_{r}(t)\\tilde{z}(n_{r}(t))}{n_{i}(t)},\\label{eq : zi}\\\\ z_{s}(t ) & = z(n_{s}(t)),\\label{eq : zs}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath50 can now be easily estimated .",
