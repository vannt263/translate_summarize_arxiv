    "the density matrix approach was introduced to describe statistical concepts in quantum mechanics by landau  @xcite , dirac  @xcite , and von neumann  @xcite . in several branches of physics like polarized spin assemblies or qudit systems , and cavity electrodynamics",
    "the density matrix approach can be cast into a su(d ) description  @xcite .",
    "the bloch vector parametrization was used to describe the 2-level problem which later on was generalized to describe beams of particles with spin @xmath0 in terms of what are known as fano statistical tensors  @xcite . in particular @xmath1 projectors defining the generators of a unitary algebra",
    "have been introduced in @xcite to expand a density matrix of spin systems , even more , they established a procedure to reconstruct the density matrix by a finite number of magnetic dipole measurements with stern - gerlach analyzers and concluded that it was necessary to do at least @xmath2 measurements to reconstruct the density matrix of pure states while @xmath3 were required for mixed states  @xcite . an experimental reconstruction of a cavity state for @xmath4 using this method is given in  @xcite .",
    "another approach uses the moore - penrose pseudoinverse to express the elements of the spin density matrix in terms of @xmath5 probabilities of spin projections  @xcite . a method to reconstruct any pure state of spin in terms of coherent states",
    "is provided in  @xcite and by means of non orthogonal projectors on coherent states a reconstruction of mixed states can be done  @xcite . a parametrization based on cholesky factorization  @xcite",
    "was first used to guarantee the positivity of the spin density matrices in  @xcite , and more recently , a tomographic approach to reconstruct them  @xcite .    in the last twenty years",
    ", a lot of work related with parametrization of the density matrices of @xmath6-level quantum systems has been done  @xcite .",
    "this is due to its applications to quantum computation and quantum information systems  @xcite .",
    "the decomposition of the density matrix into a symmetrized polynomial in lie algebra generators has been determined in  @xcite . a novel tensorial representation for density matrices of spin states , based on weinberg s covariant matrices , may be another important generalization of the bloch sphere representation  @xcite .",
    "actually , there are several parametrizations of finite density matrices : generalizations of the bloch vector  @xcite , the canonical coset decomposition of unitary matrices  @xcite , the recursive procedures to describe @xmath7 unitary matrices in terms of those of @xmath8@xcite , by factorizing @xmath7 unitary matrices in terms of points on complex spheres  @xcite , and by defining generalized euler angles  @xcite . even in the case of composite systems",
    "there are parametrizations of finite density matrices  @xcite .",
    "recently we have established a procedure to determine the extremal density matrices of a qudit system associated to the expectation value of any observable  @xcite .",
    "these matrices provide an extremal description of the mean values of the energy , and in the case of restricting them to pure states the energy spectrum is recovered .",
    "so , apart from being an alternative tool to find the eigensystem one has information of mixed states which minimize its mean value .",
    "the aim of this work is to give another option to compute extremal density matrices in a qudit space by means of an algebraic approach that leads to an underdetermined linear system in terms of the components of the bloch vector @xmath9 , the antisymmetric structure constants @xmath10 of a @xmath11 algebra , and the parameters of the hamiltonian operator @xmath12 .",
    "their solution , in general , implies to get the bloch vector in terms of a known number of free components .",
    "these are determined by establishing a system of equations associated to the characteristic polynomial of the density matrix .",
    "finally , one arrives to the extremal density matrices of the expectation value of the hamiltonian , which for the pure case let us obtain the corresponding full spectrum or for the mixed case at most @xmath13 extremal mean value energies .",
    "another goal is to bring and join different algebraic tools in the study of the behaviour of both the density matrix and hermitian operators .",
    "any hermitian hilbert - schmidt operator acting on the @xmath6-dimensional hilbert space can be expressed in terms of the identity operator plus a set of hermitian traceless operators @xmath14 which are the generators of the @xmath11 algebra . in this basis , the hamiltonian operator @xmath15 and the density matrix @xmath16 are written as  @xcite @xmath17 with the definitions @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "these generators are completely characterized by means of their commutation and anticommutation relations given by @xmath20 & = & 2 \\ , i \\sum_{q=1}^{d^2 - 1 } f_{jkq } \\hat{\\lambda}_{q } \\ , , \\label{s1:eq3}\\\\ \\{\\hat{\\lambda}_{j},\\hat{\\lambda}_{k}\\ } & = & \\frac{4}{d}\\delta_{jk}\\hat{i } + 2 \\sum_{q=1}^{d^2 - 1 } d_{jkq } \\hat{\\lambda}_{q } \\ , , \\label{s1:eq4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the symmetric and antisymmetric structure constants @xmath23 \\hat{\\lambda_q } ) \\ , , \\label{s1:eq6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and consequently , it follows the multiplication law  @xcite @xmath24    a realization of the generators can be given by the generalized gell - mann matrices  @xcite , consisting in @xmath25 symmetric matrices @xmath26 plus @xmath27 antisymmetric matrices @xmath28 and @xmath29 diagonal ones @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are matrices with @xmath33 in the component @xmath34 and @xmath35 otherwise .",
    "this type of realization belongs to the so called generalized bloch vector parametrization  @xcite .",
    "the fano statistical tensors  @xcite , the multipole moments  @xcite , the weyl matrices  @xcite , and the generalized gell - mann matrices  @xcite , belong to this group .",
    "therefore a vector with @xmath36 real components define the so called generalized bloch vector  @xcite , @xmath37 whose magnitude is bounded by  @xcite @xmath38 where the equality specifies a necessary condition to represent a pure state .",
    "in general , a @xmath39 unitary transformation acting on a hermitian matrix implies a rotation in its components , i.e. , @xmath40 where in the last equality , one has defined @xmath41 and @xmath42 are elements of an orthogonal matrix that belongs to the @xmath43 group , which provides the adjoint representation of @xmath39  @xcite .",
    "the density matrix must satisfy the following three properties : ( a ) it is hermitian , ( b ) it has trace one , and ( c ) all its eigenvalues are positive semidefinite . while for dimension @xmath44 , the condition @xmath45 implies ( c ) , for @xmath46 that is not true .",
    "the positivity conditions of the density matrix are established by the set @xmath47 of coefficients of its corresponding characteristic polynomial .",
    "this set can be obtained by means of the recursive relation known as newton - girard formulas  @xcite @xmath48 with the definitions @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 , for @xmath52 .",
    "therefore the allowed density matrix must satisfy the following system of @xmath53 simultaneous polynomial equations @xmath54 where the constants @xmath55 fix the degree of mixing of the system .",
    "thus , they must be in the region given by  @xcite @xmath56 where @xmath57 denotes a binomial coefficient .",
    "the upper bound defines the most mixed state and then it has maximum entropy , while the lower bound specifies pure states which have zero entropy . additionally , the @xmath58 for @xmath59  @xcite .",
    "all of them are polynomial functions in terms of the invariants of the density matrix , i.e. , @xmath60 , for @xmath52 . in terms of @xmath61",
    ", it is defined the symmetric matrix called bezoutian  @xcite @xmath62 a polynomial with real coefficients has reals roots iff the bezoutian matrix is positive definite  @xcite .",
    "hence , the compatible region among the invariants is obtained with the intersection of the positivity conditions of the density matrix from  ( [ s2:eq1 ] ) with the respective positivity conditions of the bezoutian ( see details in appendix  [ b ] ) .",
    "the rayleigh quotient @xmath63 of a hermitian hilbert - schmidt operator @xmath64 is @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a @xmath6-dimensional complex vector .",
    "since the rayleigh quotient is invariant under scale transformations , in searching its maximum or minimum it suffices to confine the search on unit norm vectors , i.e. , when @xmath67  @xcite .",
    "this leads to define the numerical range @xmath68 , which is the set of all possible rayleigh quotients @xmath69 over the unit vectors : @xmath70    the numerical range @xmath68 is a closed interval on the real axis , whose end points are the extreme eigenvalues of @xmath64  @xcite .",
    "this result is a particular case of the courant - fischer theorem  @xcite , which states that every eigenpair ( eigenvalue and eigenvector ) of @xmath64 is the solution of a optimization ( max - min problem ) of @xmath68 in some subspace of @xmath64 .",
    "therefore , eigenvectors and eigenvalues of @xmath64 are the critical points and critical values , respectively , of the rayleigh quotient and @xmath68 is the convex hull of its eigenvalues .    in the density matrix formalism , the numerical range of the hamiltonian ( or any hermitian operator ) can be identified with its mean value in an arbitrary state @xmath71 , i.e. , @xmath72  @xcite . in this scheme ,",
    "a useful theorem is the following one .",
    "* theorem 1 *  @xcite .",

    "_    since the equality is easy to verify when @xmath15 and @xmath16 are diagonals ( diagonal frame ) , this theorem leads to the assumption that the density matrix can be adapted to get the spectrum of @xmath15 if they both commute . in that way ,",
    "a related fact is the following",
    ".    * proposition 1 . * _ for an arbitrary @xmath80 commuting with @xmath15 , in any frame @xmath81 depends on at most @xmath53 variables parametrizing @xmath80 . _",

    "one has @xmath85 and @xmath86 with @xmath87 as the orthogonal matrix from  ( [ s1:eq14 ] ) . setting aside scalar matrices , since orthogonal transformations",

    "_    with the aim to provide further properties of the set of density matrices that commute with @xmath89 and propose an algorithm to compute the extremal mean values of the energy in the density matrix formalism , we consider from here on @xmath15 as a given non - scalar matrix and establish the proposition :    * proposition 2 .",
    "* _ let @xmath15 and @xmath71 be two finite @xmath90 hermitian matrices where @xmath71 represents an arbitrary density matrix .",

    "hence , @xmath110 achieves its extreme values at @xmath80 . in that sense , any density matrix which commutes with @xmath15 and optimizes its mean value , is extremal .",
    "even though the commutativity is satisfied by hypothesis , it implies that any state @xmath16 can be approximated at first - order by @xmath101 and @xmath110 has an error that vanishes to the second - order in @xmath111 , i.e. , @xmath112 thus , by means of the proposition @xmath33 , @xmath101 depends in general on @xmath53 variables that are fixed by establishing a degree of mixture through the expressions  ( [ s2:eq3 ] ) .",
    "finally , the highest degree of the polynomial @xmath113 in  ( [ s2:eq3 ] ) is @xmath114 .",
    "then , by bezout s theorem , the number of solutions for the polynomial system ( known as bezout bound or bezout number ) is at most the product of the degree of all the equations , i.e. , @xmath115  @xcite .",

    ". additionally , there are @xmath53 lagrange multipliers @xmath123 and @xmath53 positive real constants @xmath124 to fix the degree of purity of the density matrix ( see the bound  ( [ s2:eq1 ] ) ) .",
    "one can note that @xmath125 is a continuous function because is the sum of the rayleigh quotient @xmath126 , where @xmath127 with @xmath128 , and the positivity constraints which are polynomials in the variables of the density matrix .",
    "therefore , in order to reach all the eigenvalues of @xmath89 and its numerical range , one must find the min - max sets of @xmath125 with respect to the variables @xmath122 and the lagrange multipliers @xmath123 .",
    "their respective derivatives give @xmath129 algebraic equations , @xmath130 these sets of algebraic equations determine the extremal values of the density matrix , i.e. , @xmath131 and @xmath132 for which the expressions  ( [ s3:eq6 ] ) and  ( [ s3:eq7 ] ) are satisfied . by substituting @xmath133 into equation  ( [ s1:eq2 ] )",
    "one obtains the extremal density matrices .",
    "if we restrict the solutions to pure states @xmath134 , we have shown explicitly that the energy spectrum of the hamiltonian is recovered for @xmath135 and @xmath136  @xcite .",
    "extremal expressions for the mean value of the hamiltonian can be obtained with density matrices representing mixed quantum states , which determine also the corresponding mixture of eigenstates of the hamiltonian .    from here on , we describe an alternative algebraic procedure to get the extremal density matrices which is simpler than the one mentioned above .",
    "first of all , notice that propositions @xmath33 and @xmath137 in section  [ ray ] are based on the assumption of a common basis , which it is always possible to find if @xmath138 and @xmath15 commute .",
    "thus , in the following paragraphs , we propose for the pure case ( or mixed case ) a systematic approach to get information about the hamiltonian spectrum ( or mean value of the hamiltonian ) , i.e. , its numerical range ( interval of extremal mean values of @xmath15 ) , without making use of a diagonalization procedure .",
    "first we replace into the commutator @xmath139=0 $ ] the expressions eqs .",
    "( [ s1:eq1 ] ) and  ( [ s1:eq2 ] ) and use the properties of the generators @xmath140 of the @xmath11 algebra . then the expression  ( [ s3:eq13 ] ) gives rise to the @xmath36 dimensional homogeneous system of equations @xmath141 that determines the critical points and where @xmath142 is the bloch vector defined in  ( [ s1:eq10 ] ) .",
    "the matrix elements of the skew symmetric matrix @xmath143 of @xmath36 dimensions are given by @xmath144 where @xmath145 are the antisymmetric structure constants of the @xmath11 algebra .",
    "a single solution of the homogeneous system  ( [ s3:eq15 ] ) can be obtained through the gauss - jordan elimination method and it is identified as the critical bloch vector @xmath146 , with its @xmath147 free variables equal to the dimension of the null space of @xmath148 .",
    "this implies that maximal mixed states are always critical for any observable because the null space always contains the zero vector .",
    "on the other hand , notice that @xmath149 $ ] are hermitian vectors spanning the tangent space of the orbits associated with @xmath15 , with @xmath150 .",
    "then by substituting the hamiltonian expression  ( [ s1:eq1 ] ) one gets @xmath151 note that these vectors give the rows of @xmath148 , and the number of independent vectors @xmath152 is determined by the rank of the gram matrix @xmath153 therefore @xmath152 determines the dimension of the tangent space of the hamiltonian orbits and the rank of @xmath148 , i.e. , @xmath154  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the maximal dimension of the orbit occurs when the hamiltonian is non degenerate , i.e. , when @xmath155 and by comparing @xmath36 with @xmath152 one has that the system  ( [ s3:eq15 ] ) is always underdetermined with @xmath156 free variables ( see table  [ tab ] ) .    to clarify the method",
    ", we are going to discuss the non degenerate and degenerate cases of @xmath15 separately . in section  [ examples ] we shall illustrate the method for quantum systems of dimensions @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",
    "in this case , the rank of the matrix @xmath159 is given by @xmath160 and the @xmath161 free variables reach its minimum number , i.e. , @xmath162 .",
    "therefore , @xmath146 is given by @xmath163 where the @xmath164 components @xmath165 are functions of the parameters of the hamiltonian , the antisymmetric structure constants and a set of @xmath53 independent free variables .",
    "it is natural to choose this set from the diagonal generators  ( [ s1:eq9 ] ) of @xmath11 .",
    "the substitution of @xmath146 in  ( [ s1:eq2 ] ) gives its associated critical density matrix denoted as @xmath80 .",
    "therefore , the determination of the @xmath53 free variables is done by solving the system of @xmath53 polynomial equations  ( [ s2:eq3 ] ) , which by proposition 2 has at most @xmath116 different solutions .",
    "this is also in agreement with the analysis in the diagonal representation @xmath166 , wherein the action of the permutation group of @xmath161 elements produces @xmath167 matrices  @xcite .",
    "they satisfy the same polynomial system  ( [ s2:eq3 ] ) but give different mean values of @xmath15 . therefore , the critical density matrices are given by @xmath168 with @xmath169 denoting the bloch vector solution , the variables @xmath170 are function only of the known quantities , i.e. , the structure constants , the parameters of the hamiltonian @xmath171 , and @xmath53 constants @xmath172 .",
    "the number @xmath169 of solutions decreases up to @xmath6 when  ( [ s3:eq18 ] ) represent pure states ( all @xmath173 ) and the extremal density matrices are one - dimensional orthogonal projectors .    as to be expected",
    ", the expectation value of the hamiltonian is in general given by @xmath174 for each critical ( or extremal ) density matrix @xmath92 , with @xmath175 .",
    "for the pure case the expectation values yield the energy spectrum of the system and the extremal density matrices are orthogonal projectors .",
    "in this case the rank of the matrix @xmath159 satisfies that @xmath176 , whose value is associated to the orbits of the hamiltonian ( see table  [ tab ] ) . as the critical bloch vector @xmath146 has @xmath177 free variables with @xmath178 one then has that @xmath179 .",
    "thus , if @xmath180 denotes the number of variables appearing in the expression for the mean value of the hamiltonian in the state @xmath80 , @xmath181 , there are two cases to consider :    * when @xmath182 , one has to select @xmath183 components of the density matrix bloch vector to have @xmath53 free variables and then solve the polynomial system of equations  ( [ s2:eq3 ] ) .",
    "* when @xmath184 , one has only to pick up @xmath53 components of the density matrix bloch vector from the set of @xmath180 elements , and again to solve the mentioned polynomial equation .    in both cases",
    "@xmath53 free variables will be determined by the polynomial system  ( [ s2:eq3 ] ) .",
    "the remaining @xmath185 components can be taken equal to zero because they do not affect the commutator of @xmath15 with @xmath80 .",
    "specifically , if we are interested in the eigensystem , i.e. , all the set of @xmath186 , one can apply the following method recursively :    * make zero the @xmath187 components , to solve the polynomial system  ( [ s2:eq3 ] ) , whose solution give at least two extremal density matrices . *",
    "take the trace of the first set of solutions @xmath188 with the commuting general density matrix @xmath80 , this yields a system of algebraic equations by asking the orthogonality conditions , i.e. , @xmath189 , where @xmath114 is a label counting the number of solutions .",
    "* substitute the solutions of the linear system , to express the new critical density matrix in terms of the free variables , where @xmath53 are fixed by means of the positivity conditions ( all @xmath186 ) and the rest of the components can be taken equal to zero . *",
    "return to step 1 and repeat the procedure again , until one gets @xmath6 orthogonal projectors .    of course",
    ", one has in this case several solutions related with the degeneracy of the hamiltonian in similar form as in the standard diagonalization procedure of a finite hamiltonian matrix .",
    "although this may seem arbitrary , ultimately it is related to the codimension conditions  @xcite .",
    "this topic will be addressed in a future contribution .",
    "similarly to  ( [ s3:eq19 ] ) , in all cases , the energy spectrum is given by @xmath190 for each critical density matrix @xmath92 , with @xmath191 .",
    "for @xmath44 , one has that the generators @xmath193 can be realized in terms of the pauli matrices , i.e. , @xmath194 , @xmath195 and @xmath196 .",
    "therefore the density and hamiltonian matrices can be written in terms of the bloch vectors @xmath197 and @xmath198 , @xmath199 where @xmath200 is also called the polarization vector .",
    "thus by substituting the expressions  ( [ s5:eq1 ] ) into  ( [ s3:eq13 ] ) we obtain the condition that the bloch vectors of @xmath201 and the density matrix are parallel , @xmath202 its solution gives the critical bloch vector @xmath203 with a free variable @xmath204 , according with the dimensions of the orbits of the hamiltonian  ( see table  [ tab ] ) .    from expressions  ( [ s2:eq3 ] )",
    ", one has a single positivity condition @xmath205 by substituting  ( [ s5:eq5 ] ) into the above equation , we obtain @xmath206 where we define @xmath207 and @xmath208 . by means of  ( [ s5:eq5 ] ) and ( [ s5:eq7 ] ) , we find the critical density matrices @xmath209 which correspond exactly to the solutions given in  @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath210 .",
    "substituting them into  ( [ s3:eq19 ] ) we get @xmath211 we can distinguish two types of solutions :    * pure case ( when @xmath212 ) : one has @xmath213 , the eigenvalues @xmath214 of the hamiltonian , and from  ( [ s5:eq8 ] ) , with @xmath213 , the corresponding orthogonal projectors . * mixed case ( when @xmath215 ) : the extremal density matrices for the expectation value of the hamiltonian are given in terms of the convex sum @xmath216 where @xmath217 indicates the probability of finding the system with eigenvalue @xmath218 while @xmath219 the corresponding probability of finding an energy @xmath220 .",
    "for the qutrit case , the generators @xmath221 , with @xmath222 can be realized in terms of the gell - mann matrices  @xcite .",

    "we consider the following hamiltonian matrix @xmath227 where the parameters @xmath228 and @xmath229 are real parameters .",
    "it represents a hamiltonian written in terms of the angular momentum @xmath230 with @xmath231 .",
    "this hamiltonian has been used to describe a two mode bose - einstein condensate where the parameter @xmath228 represents the atom - atom interaction , and @xmath229 is related with the tunnelling parameter or a symmetric system of two interacting qubits  @xcite .",
    "the bloch vector for the hamiltonian is given by @xmath232 substituting the components of @xmath233 into  ( [ s5:eq13 ] ) , one finds that the rank of @xmath143 is @xmath234 , implying that the hamiltonian is non degenerate . solving the system of equations  ( [ s3:eq15 ] ) with the gauss - jordan elimination method , one obtains the extremal bloch vector for the density matrix @xmath235 thus the associated critical density matrix",
    "is found by replacing the components of @xmath146 into  ( [ s5:eq12 ] ) , which is denoted by @xmath236 .",
    "for this case , to guarantee the positivity of the density matrix , one must consider @xmath237    newly one has two types of solutions :    * pure case ( taking @xmath238 ) : solving the system of equations @xmath212 and @xmath239 , one arrives to @xmath136 different solutions for @xmath240 and @xmath241 , denoted by @xmath242 which yield three independent bloch vectors of the density matrix , namely @xmath243 whose norm is equal to @xmath244 and the scalar products between them are equal to @xmath245 .",
