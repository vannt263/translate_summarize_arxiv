    "our calculations show that local heating dissipated to the cold temperature reservoir is very small compared with the large phonon s thermal current considered in this study .",

    "finally , we would like to mention that the simplified weak link model may not be perfect in quantitative description of the phonon s thermal current .",

    "the reason for large discrepancy between the @xmath10 value is as the following : the stiffness of a 4-al linear atomic chain ( @xmath347 n / m ) from total energy calculations is much larger than the stiffness of pt monatomic chain ( @xmath385 n / m ) measured in experiments .",
    "this comparison infers that the stiffness @xmath90 is likely to depend strongly on the detailed atomic structure of the full system , especially in the contact region .",
    "for example , the atom chain could be particularly stiff along the chain direction when the atomic chain forms a perfectly straight line ; otherwise , the atomic ( zigzag ) chain could easily bend with much smaller stiffness .",
    "the total energy calculations have assumed that the atomic chain is perfectly linear .",
    "this may lead to significant overestimation for the @xmath10 value .",
    "the imperfection of the contact region in the real system may allow the possibility ( for example , zigzag chain instead of perfect linear chain ) to suppress the phonon s thermal current by creating a frustration in the mechanical link connecting to the electrodes . in this case , the thermoelectric refrigeration at atomic scale may be salient .    in short , atomic - level control of the contact region",
