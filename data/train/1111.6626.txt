    "the majority of events fall within a `` normal '' grouping , although some cases have been recognized where the luminosity does not correlate with peak width ( e.g. , benetti et al.2005 ; wang et al .",

    "sn  2011fe was the nearest type  ia explosion in several decades , providing an unprecedented opportunity to obtain spectropolarimetry of a normal sn  ia with modest - aperture telescopes .",

    "the spol ccd imaging / spectropolarimeter @xcite mounted on the steward observatory 2.3-m bok telescope ( kitt peak , az ) and the 1.54 kuiper telescope ( mt .  bigelow , az ) was used to obtain spectropolarimetry of sn  2011fe over 10 nights .",
    "we have grouped the 10 nights of observations into four epochs in table  1 .",
    "observations covered 40007550  at a resolution of @xmath120    ( 600 line mm@xmath2 grating in first order , using a 5@xmath31@xmath451@xmath5  slit and a hoya l38 blocking filter ) . a rotatable semiachromatic half - wave plate",
    "was used to modulate incident polarization and a wollaston prism in the collimated beam separated the orthogonally polarized spectra onto a thinned , anti - reflection - coated 800@xmath41200 site ccd .",
    "the efficiency of the wave plate as a function of wavelength is measured by inserting a fully - polarizing nicol prism into the beam above the slit .",
    "a series of four separate exposures that sample 16 orientations of the wave plate yields two independent , background - subtracted measures of each of the normalized linear stokes parameters , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "each night , several such sequences of observations of sn  2011fe were obtained and combined , with the weighting of the individual measurements based on photon statistics . the polarization results for september 15 and 16 were indistinguishable , so they were combined to yield the final result for the third observational epoch .",
    "similarly , the polarization spectra from the six observations obtained between september 26 and october 6 ( epoch 4 ) were averaged together , since we detected no inter - night variations in @xmath8 or @xmath9 over this time period .",
    "we confirmed that the instrumental polarization of spol mounted on the bok and kuiper telescopes is much less than 0.1% through observations of the unpolarized standard stars bd+28@xmath104211 and hd  212311 @xcite during each epoch .",
    "the linear polarization position angle on the sky ( @xmath11 ) was determined by observing the interstellar polarization standards hiltner  960 and vi  cyg  # 12 @xcite during all epochs .",
    "additional observations of the polarization standard stars bd+59@xmath10389 and bd+64@xmath10106 were made during the third epoch ( table  1 ) .",
    "the adopted correction from the instrumental to the standard equatorial frame for @xmath11 for all epochs was determined from the average position angle offset of hiltner  960 and vi  cyg  # 12 .",
    "differences between the measured and expected polarization position angles were @xmath12 for all of the standard stars .    during the first epoch ,",
    "two field stars within @xmath12  of sn  2011fe ( 2mass j14031367 + 5415431 and 2mass j14025413 + 5416288 ) were measured to check for significant galactic interstellar polarization ( isp ) along the line - of - sight to the sn .",
    "these stars yielded a consistent estimate for galactic isp , with @xmath13% at @xmath14 for 2mass j14031367 + 5415431 and @xmath15% at @xmath16 for 2mass j14025413 + 5416288 , assuming that @xmath17 , the wavelength where the interstellar polarization is at a maximum ( @xmath18 ) is 5550 .",
    "the results for the field stars were averaged and @xmath19% at @xmath20 was adopted as the galactic isp in the sightline to sn  2011fe .",
    "this low value for the galactic isp is consistent with the high galactic latitude of m101 and the very low estimated amount of extinction for the supernova .",
    "the polarization spectra of sn  2011fe have been corrected for this level of galactic isp assuming that it is fit well by a serkowski law @xcite .",
    "no estimate or correction for isp within m101 at the location of sn  2011fe has been made ( although see  3 ) .",
    "our reported values for the degree of linear polarization , @xmath21 , have been corrected for statistical bias @xcite .",
    "our sequence of spectra are shown in the top panel of figure  [ fig : spec - seq ] , displaying the emergence of absorption features typical of sne  ia .",
    "the continuum emission is polarized with the red wavelengths more highly polarized than the blue wavelengths at early epochs , reaching up to @xmath10.4% .",
    "the polarization of the red continuum ( 6500 - 7500 ) exhibits a slight decrease with time , from about 0.4% down to 0.2% , while continuum polarization in the 5000 - 5900  range increases from undetected up to 0.2% .",
    "the polarization of absorption lines is clearly present in blueshifted si  ii @xmath06355  absorption , and it changes markedly with time .",
    "this line polarization of si  ii is shown in velocity space in figure  [ fig : si2-vel ] . before maximum at epoch 1 ,",
    "si   ii @xmath06355  shows polarization at the same position angle ( pa ) as the continuum , but is roughly 0.2% stronger than the adjacent continuum in polarization degree . in the subsequent two epochs near maximum ( epochs 2 and 3 ) , however , si  ii @xmath06355absorption has @xmath10.2% _ weaker _ polarization than the continuum , and the absorption - line pa changes by about 90(figure  [ fig : si2-vel ] ) .",
    "well after maximum in epoch 4 , the absorption trough returns to showing the same polarization and pa as the adjacent continuum  although note that the continuum polarization has increased since epoch 1 .",
    "the blueshift of the si  ii feature decreases with epoch , consistent with a low velocity gradient event ( lvg ; benetti et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "line polarization is also present in an absorption feature in the 4600 - 5000   region .",
    "this might be si  ii @xmath05051 , which may be blended with nearby fe  ii lines .",
    "similar blue features have been seen to exhibit line polarization in other sne  ia ( leonard et al .",
    "2005 ) , although not necessarily the same absorption feature as in sn  2011fe .",
    "the polarization of this feature is also variable , exhibiting overall behavior similar to that of si  ii @xmath06355 , but shifted about one epoch earlier in time . in other words ,",
    "this blue absorption feature shows line depolarization in epoch 1 , which then disappears in epochs 2 and 3 when the same depolarization appears in the si  ii @xmath06355  line .",
    "moreover , the apparent depolarization of the blue line approaches a pa that is nearly orthogonal to the continuum polarization pa , similar to what occurs later for the red absorption line .",
    "we speculate that the blue absorption feature traces the same asymmetric layers in the sn atmosphere that are seen in si  ii @xmath06355 in epochs 2 and 3 , but at an earlier time .",
    "this may be an important clue to the changing structure in the receding sn photosphere , which can hopefully provide constraints on additional radiative transfer models of the observed polarization behavior .",
    "a key result of our spectropolarimetry is that si  ii @xmath06355 absorption exhibits a polarization angle that changes with time , and more importantly , reaches a pa in the absorption line polarization that is roughly _ orthogonal _ to the adjacent continuum polarization angle for an extended time around maximum light when the line depolarization is strongest .",
    "this behavior can be approximated by two polarized components that have perpendicular pas , and comparable amounts of polarization that do not completely cancel , leaving a net residual linear polarization .",
    "small changes in the strength of the absorption line feature s polarization can shift the residual net polarization by 90 , because one or the other components dominates .",
    "this behavior is approximated by a simple two - component model of the spectrum at epoch 3 , shown in figure  [ fig : model ] , where the observed flux is composed of two such orthogonal components , but where one of the two has a different absorption equivalent width in si  ii @xmath06355 .",
    "there is a small amount ( @xmath10.2% ) of net residual continuum polarization dominated by one component , but this changes across the line feature due to absorption of the polarized continuum flux by the line .",
    "the fact that these two components have orthogonal pas that persist with time and are seen at the earliest epoch in a different absorption feature , is suggestive that there is some small amount of global asymmetry in the ejecta of sn  2011fe , perhaps even suggesting axial symmetry in the event .",
    "for example , the observations could be explained if the continuum polarization arises from an electron scattering photosphere that is slightly elongated in the polar direction , whereas the strongest si  ii @xmath06355 absorption may occur in an equatorial belt .",
    "this is just one possible scenario .",
    "more definitive constraints on the sn ejecta geometry will require more detailed analysis with radiative transfer calculations .",
