    "<S> recently a new technique for the production of muon ( @xmath0 ) and muonium ( @xmath1 ) beams of unprecedented brightness has been proposed . </S>",
    "<S> as one consequence and using a highly stable mach - zehnder type interferometer , a measurement of the gravitational acceleration @xmath2 of muonium atoms at the few percent level of precision appears feasible within 100days of running time . </S>",
    "<S> the inertial mass of muonium is dominated by the mass of the positively charged - antimatter - muon . </S>",
    "<S> the measurement of @xmath2 would be the first test of the gravitational interaction of antimatter , of a purely leptonic system , and of particles of the second generation .    </S>",
    "<S> the gravitational acceleration of antimatter has not been measured so far . </S>",
    "<S> an experiment with antiprotons ( see  @xcite and references therein ) did not succeed because of the extreme difficulty to sufficiently shield the interaction region from electromagnetic fields . for a similar reason , results of measurements with electrons  @xcite are discussed very controversial and the plan to eventually compare with positrons was never realized . not affected by these problems are neutral systems like antihydrogen and , consequently , considerable effort today is devoted to the preparation of suitable samples of antihydrogen ( compare  @xcite ) . a possibility to measure </S>",
    "<S> the effect of gravitation on neutral particles is via a phase acquired in the gravitational potential in a suitably built interferometer , demonstrated in the classic colella  </S>",
    "<S> overhauser  werner ( cow ) experiment  @xcite . in case of limited source performance , </S>",
    "<S> when one has to deal with extended sources , comparatively large beam divergence and poor energy definition , mach - zehnder type interferometers have striking advantages  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . their performance has been demonstrated , among others , with neutrons  @xcite and atoms  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the idea to apply interferometry to the measurement of an antimatter system was inspired by the cow - experiments and dates back , as far as i know , to the 1980s  @xcite but was put into print , with explicit mentioning of antihydrogen , positronium and antineutrons , first in 1997  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> common problems of the species are the quality of the particle beams and the availability of suitable , sufficiently large gratings . </S>",
    "<S> the case of positronium was further elaborated suggesting the use of standing light waves as diffraction gratings  @xcite but the realization of an experiment appears still very challenging . in the meantime also other experimental approaches to measure the gravitational interaction have been proposed for antihydrogen and positronium , see  @xcite for an overview .    </S>",
    "<S> no discussion about a gravity experiment using muonium atoms ( m = @xmath1 ) appeared in the literature yet and the original idea of using m atoms for testing antimatter gravity is again by simons  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the suitability of m atoms comes from the fact that the inertial mass of the muon is some 207 times larger than the one of the electron , thus , muonium is almost completey , to 99.5% , antimatter . </S>",
    "<S> an interesting feature is that m atoms are almost exclusively produced at thermal energies by stopping @xmath0 in matter which they often leave again as thermalized , hydrogen - like , m atom . </S>",
    "<S> however , up to until recently , a gravitational experiment with muonium would have been science fiction . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for this publication is , that there is now the real chance to perform such an experiment within the next few years .    </S>",
    "<S> an experiment with m atoms would constitute the first test of the gravitational interaction of antimatter with matter . </S>",
    "<S> it would also be the first and probably unique test of particles of the second generation . while it would also be the first test in a purely leptonic system one should note that tests of the equivalence principle proving at a high level of precision that the gravitational interaction is independent of composition of test masses also in principle prove ( to still impressive precision ) that electrons fall in the same way as the rest of the material . for a recent review on tests of the equivalence principle see  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> as a first measurement , the determination of the sign of interaction could be already interesting ( for a discussion of antigravity see  @xcite , but also , e.g ,  @xcite ) , however , a reasonable first goal for such an experiment would be to determine @xmath2 to better than 10% . </S>",
    "<S> one should add here , that it is not at all obvious that there could be a discrepancy between the gravitational interaction of matter and antimatter , see  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> but the universality of  @xcite has been disputed and possible scenarios have been sketched in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> anyhow , an experimentalist will probably favor the direct measurement ( and this , again , not only with respect to antimatter but also to a lepton of the second generation ) over the discussion of models . </S>",
    "<S> the following quote from  @xcite for _ antiprotons _ holds equally well for _ muonium atoms _ : `` it would be the first test of gravity , i.e. general relativity , in the realm of antimatter . </S>",
    "<S> even if the experiment finds exactly what one expects , namely that antimatter falls toward the earth just as matter does , it would be , a classic , one for the text books. .... of course , if a new effect were found in the _ antiproton _ gravity experiment , then there would be no telling what exciting physics could follow . ''    </S>",
    "<S> the muonium experiment appears feasible now because of two recent inventions : ( i ) a new technique to stop , extract and compress a high intensity beam of positive muons , to reaccelerate the muons to 10kev and focus them into a beam spot of 100@xmath3 m diameter or even less  @xcite ; and ( ii ) a new technique to efficiently convert the muons to m atoms in superfluid helium at or below 0.5k in which they thermalize and from which they get boosted by 270k perpendicular to the surface when they leave into vacuum  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> assuming an existing surface muon beam of highest intensity as input , see e.g.  @xcite , it should be possible to obtain an almost monochromatic beam of m atoms ( @xmath4 ) with a velocity of about 6300 m/s ( corresponding to 270k or a wavelength @xmath5 ) and a 1-dimensional divergence of @xmath6mrad at a rate of about @xmath7s@xmath8 m atoms  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is a many orders of magnitude brighter beam than available up to now .    following the approach of  @xcite a mach - zehnder type interferometer </S>",
    "<S> should be used in the muonium experiment . the principle with the source , the three grating interferometer and the detection region </S>",
    "<S> is sketched in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ setup.eps ] . </S>",
    "<S> we assume here three identical gratings and use the first two for setting up the interference pattern which is scanned by moving the third grating . </S>",
    "<S> the setup is rather short , because the decay length of the m atoms is about 1.4 cm only ( @xmath9s ) . </S>",
    "<S> the whole system from source to detection may be 4 decay lengths long , and without further collimation the source illuminates a cross section of less than 5 mm over the length of the interferometer . </S>",
    "<S> the three free - standing gratings can be made sufficiently large with existing , proven technology with a period of 100 nm  @xcite resulting in a diffraction angle @xmath10mrad . </S>",
    "<S> the optimum distance @xmath11 between two gratings is slightly larger than one decay length ; however , for simplicity here @xmath12 cm . assuming another length @xmath11 each , for distances of the source and the detector to the nearest interferometer grating , results in 4 decay lenghts . </S>",
    "<S> decay and transmission loss by the three 50% open ratio gratings reduces the initial m rate by a factor @xmath13 , yielding @xmath14s@xmath8 detected m. because only the indicated first order diffraction carries the desired information but essentially all transmitted m are detected , the interference pattern has a reduced contrast of somewhat below 4/9 . assuming a contrast of @xmath15 and using eqn . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) of  @xcite yields the statistical sensitivity of the experiment : @xmath16 which means that the sign of @xmath2 is fixed after one day and 3% accuracy can be achieved after 100days of running .     </S>",
    "<S> scheme of the experimental setup : the m beam comes from the cryogenic @xmath0 beam target on the left hand side , enters and partially traverses the interferometer and reaches the detection region on the right hand side . </S>",
    "<S> the dimensions are not to scale and the diffraction angle @xmath17 is in reality smaller than the divergence . ]    with the quite satisfactory statistics , the next important issues are the alignment and stability of the interferometer . </S>",
    "<S> the gravitational phase shift to be observed is ( using the notation of  @xcite ) @xmath18 this is rather small but still an order of magnitude larger than the phase shift due to the acceleration induced by the rotation of the earth ( sagnac effect : @xmath19 ) . </S>",
    "<S> other accelerations of the system as a whole , e.g. from environmental noise , mainly affect the contrast and must therefore be suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> the same is true for misalignments of the gratings and their drifts . </S>",
    "<S> the effects must be kept below the phase shift , for example , for an unwanted translation @xmath20 of the third ( scanning ) grating perpendicular to the m beam and the lines of the grating one requires @xmath21 and consequently @xmath22 rotational misalignment of the gratings around the m beam must be much less than the period over beam height ratio , 100nm/5 mm , or 20@xmath3rad and corresponding drifts must not exceed 20nrad . in a similar way , limits for all other static or dynamic deviations from the perfect alignment of the three identical , equidistant , parallel gratings can be obtained .    </S>",
    "<S> the relatively small size of the interferometer is a major advantage for the stabilization . as in previous matter interferometry experiments  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the muonium experiment must use ( multiple ) laser interferometry for alignment , monitoring and feedback position stabilization . </S>",
    "<S> the gratings for the laser interferometry are ideally integrated in the m atom gratings as perfect alignment is required . </S>",
    "<S> state of the art piezo systems can be used for positioning the gratings and for scanning of the third grating with a step precision of 50pm or better . because it will not be possible to perform a comparative experiment with the ( @xmath23 ) system </S>",
    "<S> , the gravitational effect on the m atoms will be calibrated with a laser interferometer : in case of a vertical separation of the beam paths in the inteferometer , as in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ setup.eps ] , the m fringes will be shifted by gravity with respect to the laser interference pattern . by a @xmath24 rotation of the setup around the beam axis </S>",
    "<S> the gravity shift can be removed from the m interference while the laser stays unaffected ( the gravitational redshift effects can be safely neglected at the level of precision required here ) . </S>",
    "<S> of course , the sagnac effect has to be taken into account , which does not affect the interference in the vertical but will do so in the horizontal position . </S>",
    "<S> given the possible sensitivity of the experiment it might be just at the edge , but in principle can be measured by horizontal measurements at @xmath24 and @xmath25 rotations of the setup , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> also a setup with a vertical m beam would allow studying the sagnac effect and the stability of the interferometer . </S>",
    "<S> this could also be a first stage of the experiment because for practical reasons the m beam development would probably first produce a vertical beam  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the muonium detection itself is straight forward : the @xmath26 from the @xmath0 decay must be detected in a way that the position of the m atom can be determined to be behind the interferometer . </S>",
    "<S> a coincidence signal from the detection system is desirable in order to suppress background coming from the 3 orders of magnitude more muon decays upstream of the third grating . </S>",
    "<S> one way to achieve this is to detect both , the decay @xmath26 and the remaining atomic @xmath27 from the m atom decay in flight . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath26 ( energies up to 53mev ) could be detected in a scintillation detector which is segmented along the beam axis and surrounds the m beam . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath27 ( energies of 10ev ) will be electrostatically accelerated out of the decay region onto , e.g. , a microchannel plate .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , a muonium gravity experiment appears feasible today . </S>",
    "<S> the development of the required m beam could be done within a few years and the interferometer set up in parallel and tested with its lasers interferometry offline . </S>",
    "<S> it appears possible to have the gravitational acceleration of m atoms measured to better than 10% within the next 5 years . </S>"
