    "laboratory studies of ultrathin films of transition metals confirm the general principle that broken symmetry induces magnetic anisotropy.@xcite the most common example is the loss of translational invariance at the free surface of a film or at an internal interface of a multilayer structure .",
    "the phenomenological `` broken - bond '' model of nel@xcite then provides an intuitive way to understand why atoms at the surface or interface favor alignment of their magnetic moments either parallel or perpendicular to the broken symmetry plane.@xcite in some cases , perpendicular anisotropy occurs that is strong enough to overwhelm the tendency for in - plane magnetization favored by magnetostatic shape anisotropy .",
    "this situation can be exploited for a variety of applications and has been the subject of very thorough experimental and theoretical work.@xcite    in this paper , we focus on a related phenomenon : the magnetic anisotropy induced by crystallographic steps on the surface of a single crystal film . here , it is the loss of translational invariance in directions parallel to the ( nominal ) surface plane that is germane .",
    "application of the nel model suggests that local moments will tend to align themselves either parallel or perpendicular to the local step orientation .",
    "the magnitude of the effect ( on a per atom basis ) is predicted to be comparable to conventional surface anisotropy .",
    "however , it was not until 1987 that hillebrands _",
    "invoked step - induced anisotropy to rationalize their surface spin wave data for epitaxial fe / w(110).@xcite since all ultrathin films invariably have step edges ( associated either with steps on the substrate or with the nucleation and growth of monolayer height islands during the growth process ) it is not surprising that subsequent experimental studies often cite this phenomenon in connection with `` surface roughness effects''.@xcite    we recently presented a theoretical study of in - plane magnetization reversal in ultrathin films with step structure in typical samples.@xcite the model film was comprised of an array of square , monolayer - height , magnetic islands of variable size and density on top of a few complete magnetic layers .",
    "classical xy - type spins at each site were presumed to rotate in the surface plane subject to nearest - neighbor ferromagnetic exchange , an intrinsic four - fold in - plane anisotropy at all surface sites , zeeman energy from an external field , and a two - fold anisotropy at island perimeter sites only .",
    "numerical simulations and simple geometric scaling arguments predicted significant variations in coercivity as a function of coverage for layer - by - layer growth at low island nucleation densities .",
    "this result was found to be in semi - quantitative agreement with the surface magneto - optic kerr effect ( smoke ) data of buckley _",
    "et al._@xcite for the cu / co / cu(001 ) system .",
    "a subsequent monte carlo simulation study @xcite of coercivity in islanded fe sesquilayers on w(110 ) using an in - plane ising - type spin model yielded similarly good results in comparison to experiment .",
    "the theoretical results of ref .   were interpretable on the basis of several qualitative concepts : ( i ) nucleation of magnetization reversal at island edges ; ( ii ) pinning of domain walls at island edges ; and ( iii ) fusion of nearby domains .",
    "unfortunately , even the simple island morphology studied there was still too complex to permit a detailed analytic treatment of the reversal process as one might desire .",
    "for this reason , we analyze an even simpler problem in this paper : zero - temperature , in - plane magnetization reversal in ultrathin vicinal films .",
    "the basic model sketched above remains unchanged except that the morphology is simplified to a periodic array of flat magnetic terraces separated by straight , monolayer - height steps .",
    "this renders the problem one - dimensional and amenable to analytic study .",
    "one - dimensional models of magnetization reversal with inhomogeneous or competing anisotropies have been a fixture of the magnetism literature for many years .",
    "most of these papers focus on the demonstration that planar defects in bulk ferromagnets can nucleate reversal and/or pin domain wall motion .",
    "if operative , these effects call into question the suitability of the popular single - domain , coherent rotation model of stoner and wohlfarth @xcite as a description of magnetization reversal . filipov @xcite and later brown@xcite studied the effect of surface anisotropies on the nucleation field ( where the magnetization first deviates from its saturation value ) while mitsek and semyannikov@xcite and later friedberg and paul @xcite focused on the depinning of pre - existing reversed domains as a determinant of the coercive field ( where the magnetization projected on the external field direction first falls to zero ) .",
    "in recent years , arrott has been explicit in the application of these ideas to ultrathin films with and without step structure.@xcite our analysis will be seen to substantially extend all of these studies .    on the experimental side , heinrich _ et al._@xcite first drew attention to the fact that a step - induced uniaxial anisotropy must be present on vicinal surfaces .",
    "subsequent work confirmed this observation@xcite and revealed a number of other systematic features .",
    "as particular motivation for the present work , we draw attention to the smoke data of kawakami _",
    "et al._@xcite obtained from fe films grown on stepped ag(001 ) substrates .",
    "characteristic `` split - loop '' hysteresis curves were found where the degree of splitting varied smoothly with the degree of vicinality .",

    "section ii is an overview that includes ( i ) a discussion of the model assumptions ; ( ii ) the definition of important dimensionless quantities and the presentation of a `` phase diagram '' that catalogs the possible hysteresis loop topologies than can occur ; ( iii ) a qualitative discussion of the physical mechanisms of magnetization reversal that can occur ; and ( iv ) a preliminary comparison to relevant experiments .",

    "magnetostatics contributes to the total surface anisotropy that compels the spins to lie in - plane . for this model , with in - plane spins , magnetostatics is not treated explicitly because its additional effects are known to be negligible in the ultrathin limit.@xcite figure [ fig : geom ] is a schematic representation of the physical situation and the spin chain model studied here .    for simplicity ,",

    "the relative values of @xmath13 , @xmath91 , @xmath14 were used to construct all the phase boundaries shown in figure [ fig : pd ] .",

    "no jump fields exist for @xmath179 and @xmath180 for @xmath181 .",
    "this is the same terrace length shown in figure [ fig : l_th ] where the dashed line @xmath182 intersects the curve of @xmath158 for which the extrema ( and hence the jump fields ) first disappear .",
    "the i - iia phase boundary is asymptotically vertical as @xmath183 .",
    "the limiting value of @xmath184 is found from the same procedure as above by putting @xmath108 in ( [ big ] ) .",
    "the result is @xmath185 .",
    "figure [ fig : h_l_lt ] shows the @xmath26 dependence of the nucleation and jump fields for @xmath186 .",
    "the absence of the jump fields defines the range of phase i as before .",
    "the other phases exhibit the relative orderings of the characteristic fields discussed in section ii , i.e. , .",

    "figure [ fig : h_l_jr ] shows the nucleation and jump fields for @xmath188 .",
    "the re - entrant behavior iia @xmath25 iib @xmath25 iia described in section ii arises because the curves of @xmath91 and @xmath13 intersect twice .",
    "the transition from iia to iib at fixed @xmath26 is readily understood .",
    "@xmath91 is nearly independent of @xmath24 because it is related to terrace spin behavior far from the steps . but",
    "@xmath13 decreases rapidly as @xmath163 decreases because the torque on step spins is reduced",
    ". eventually , @xmath13 drops below @xmath91 for all values of @xmath26 .",
    "we omit a figure that shows the iic - iib phase boundary ( @xmath16 ) explicitly .",
    "we note finally that there is a critical point in the phase diagram @xmath189 where @xmath91 , @xmath14 , and @xmath13 are coincident .",
    "this is the point in figure [ fig : pd ] where the i - iia , iia - iib , iib - iic , and iic - i phase boundaries all meet .",
    "our best estimate is @xmath190 and @xmath191 .",
    "an important conclusion from our analysis is that a distinct hysteresis loop topology does not imply a distinct mechanism of magnetization reversal .",
    "this is immediately clear from figure [ fig : pd ] where all four phases are present in the @xmath67 limit of nearly coherent rotation and three of the four phases are present in the limit of widely separated steps where reversal occurs by domain wall depinning .",
    "no sharp transition separates these cases .",
    "instead the reversal mechanism smoothly crosses over from coherent rotation to domain wall depinning as the terrace length or step anisotropy is increased .",
    "the crossover is most easily understood for the case of nucleation which , as noted , always occurs at the steps due to the torque exerted on the saturated state by the local two - fold anisotropy . when @xmath192 , nucleation results in the formation of a domain of rotated spins around each step separated from the unrotated terrace spins by a domain wall .",
    "now suppose that @xmath26 is reduced , say , by increasing the vicinality of the substrate .",
    "the spins on the terrace rotate away from saturation when the domain walls begin to overlap . in the limit",
    "when @xmath193 , their rotation becomes indistinguishable from the rotation of the step spins and the coherent rotation picture is a good approximation to nucleation .",
    "alternately , suppose that @xmath24 is reduced , say , by increasing the film thickness or by adsorbing foreign gases onto the steps .",
    "this reduces the torque on the step spins so that their angular deviation from the terrace spins is not as great . in the limit when @xmath194 , this difference nearly disappears and the coherent rotation picture is again appropriate .",
    "we turn next the first jump field @xmath14 .",
    "coburn and co - workers @xcite have presented a model of reversal for ultrathin magnetic films with in - plane magnetization and four - fold anisotropy .",
    "they assume that the film is well described by a single homogeneous domain before and after every jump in the hysteresis curve .",
    "domain walls are presumed to nucleate at widely separated surface steps or other defects .",
    "magnetization jumps occur when the energy density gain to make the transition @xmath195 is equal to a phenomenological energy density @xmath196 needed to depin the wall from the most effective pin in the film .",
    "this description approximately reproduces our results when @xmath162 is large if we take account of the inhomogeneous spin configuration induced by the steps . in section",
    "ii , @xmath14 was defined as the field when the energy barrier @xmath17 vanished . here , @xmath197 where @xmath198 and @xmath130 is a constant with dimensions of energy .",
    "the first term is the zeeman energy gain of the saturated state compared to the @xmath0 state .",
    "the second term is the energy cost of the domain walls near the two steps that bound a terrace .",
    "the last term represents an effective repulsive interaction between neighboring walls that arises from the overlap of domain walls .",
    "the terrace spins in the overlap region pay anisotropy energy , and the energy of the initial state rises compared to the single step case .",
    "the exponential dependence on wall separation is familiar from other problems where periodic domains form , e.g , the commensurate - incommensurate transition.@xcite    the condition @xmath199 yields the estimate @xmath200 this agrees with ( [ hs ] ) up to the prefactor of the exponential if @xmath201 .",
    "this is not unreasonable because the barrier for the two domain walls to depin , sweep across their common terrace , and annihilate is associated with a spin configuration where the two walls are separated by a distance small compared to @xmath26 but large compared to the exchange length @xmath202 .",
    "of course , @xmath196 is not distributed across the terrace in any physical sense .",
    "it is associated solely with the particular spin configuration described just above .",
    "we remarked in section ii.c that the shape of the smoke loops obtained by chen and erskine@xcite for flat and vicinal ultrathin fe / w(001 ) appear ( to the eye ) to be very similar to our phase iii and phase ii topologies , respectively . to see that this is not unreasonable ,",
    "we combine the @xmath203 terrace widths reported in ref .   with typical values of the magnetic parameters @xmath204 j ,",
    "@xmath205 mj / m@xmath206 , and @xmath207 mj / m@xmath206@xcite to discover that this experiment corresponds to @xmath208 and @xmath209 .",
    "this is indeed in the vicinity of the ii - iii phase boundary .",
    "we assigned the same transition to the data of kawakami _",
    "et al_.@xcite for 25 ml of fe on a sequence of surfaces vicinal to ag(001 ) .",
    "this is still nominally an ultrathin film because the exchange length @xmath210 ml using the values above .",
    "in fact , the results of this experiment lay even closer to the lower left corner of our phase diagram than the chen and erskine experiment because the vicinality is greater .    the authors of ref .",
    "analyzed their data with a single domain model similar to that of coburn and co - workers @xcite except that the step anisotropy was distributed across the terraces and the depinning energy @xmath196 was set to zero .",
    "such a model actually yields no hysteresis at all  just a magnetization curve with two symmetrical jumps .",
    "magnetic parameters were extracted from the experiment by matching this jump to the average of what we call @xmath14 and @xmath91 . in our opinion , formulae similar to our ( [ nuc ] ) and ( [ ht ] ) for @xmath69 and @xmath211 should be used to analyze the large vicinality data@xcite of ref .  .",
    "it is easy to think of extensions of the model studied here that would render the results more directly comparable to experiment .",
    "probably the most stringent assumption we make is that the magnetic film smoothly coats the vicinal substrate .",
    "for relatively small terrace lengths , this is possible if the deposition is performed at high temperature so that nucleation of islands on the terraces is suppressed and growth occurs in so - called `` step - flow '' mode.@xcite otherwise , it is necessary to take account of the effect of these islands on the hysteresis .",
    "this was the subject of a previous paper by us@xcite for a square island geometry and we can use those results to suggest the effect in the present case .    for fixed deposition conditions , island nucleation is increasingly probable as the terrace length increases.@xcite for this reason , we focus on the right hand side of the phase diagram .",
    "the magnetization jump at @xmath14 will be interrupted because the domain walls depinned from the vicinal steps will not sweep completely across the terraces .",
    "instead , they will be repinned by the channels between islands .",
    "this introduces additional jump structure into the hysteresis curves and likely will alter the coercive field significantly .",
    "we expect little change in @xmath91 but there will be an extra magnetization jump before final reversal associated with spins that remain pinned in the original saturation direction at island edges perpendicular to the vicinal step edges .",
    "the one - dimensional character of our model arises because we assumed perfectly straight steps .",
    "this is not generally the case because the desired step - flow growth mode itself induces a step - wandering instability.@xcite this instability will have the effect of introducing two - fold anisotropies in a variety of directions and a random anisotropy model ( with spatially correlated randomness ) might be a suitable starting point in the limit of large waviness .",
    "non - uniform terrace widths are another feature of real vicinal surfaces that might also be treated in a more complete model .",
    "the result is easy to guess in the pinned limit where every terrace acts independently .",
    "otherwise , nucleation and subsequent jumps will occur first in regions of the film with largest step density and eventually spread to regions of low step density .",
    "finally , we have ignored both perpendicular variations in the magnetization and all explicit magnetostatic effects . for a vicinal surface",
    ", dipole - dipole coupling actually induces the spins to lay in the average surface plane of the entire crystal@xcite rather than in the plane of the terraces as we have assumed .",
    "when combined with crystallographic surface anisotropy , this effect induces a two - fold anisotropy parallel to the steps at all terrace sites.@xcite such a term is easily included in our basic energy expression ( [ specific ] ) and does not appreciably complicate the analysis .",
    "this work was motivated by the increasing awareness that the step structure of ultrathin magnetic films can have a profound effect on magnetic reversal and hysteresis .",
    "our theoretical study focused on perhaps the simplest case : a film deposited on a vicinal surface comprised of uniform length terraces separated by monoatomic steps .",
    "the magnetization was assumed to lay in the plane parallel to the terraces and to vary negligibly in the direction perpendicular to the terraces and parallel to the steps .",
    "we assumed the presence of an intrinsic four - fold in - plane anisotropy at every site and a two - fold anisotropy at step sites only .",
    "explicit magnetostatics was ignored .",
    "attention was directed to the interesting case where one orients an external field perpendicular to the direction of the two - fold axes .",
    "the final model studied was a one - dimensional , ferromagnetic spin chain in an external field with spatially inhomogeneous anisotropy .",
    "the analysis was performed in the continuum ( micromagnetic ) limit where the spin configuration is represented by a function @xmath34 that encodes the angular deviation of the magnetization from the external field direction .",
    "four characteristic hysteresis loop topologies were found and designated as `` phases '' in a two - dimensional diagram labeled by the natural control parameters of the model : a scaled terrace length @xmath26 and a scaled step anisotropy strength @xmath24 .",
    "the hysteresis loops were characterized by a nucleation field @xmath13 , where the magnetization first deviates from saturation , a step jump field @xmath14 where a jump in magnetization occurs from near saturation to a state where many spins are aligned parallel to the steps , and a terrace field @xmath91 where a jump in magnetization occurs to the nearly reversed state . for large values of @xmath26 we found @xmath212 and @xmath213 with @xmath214 .    in all cases",
    ", reversal initiates at the steps because the torque applied by the local anisotropy is maximal there in the saturated state .",
    "no sharp transition separates the cases of subsequent spin rotation by nearly coherent rotation and subsequent spin rotation by depinning of a @xmath0 domain wall from the steps .",
    "it is a crossover phenomenon .",
    "the coherent rotation model of stoner & wohlfarth ( sw ) is most appropriate in the lower left corner of our phase diagram .",
    "the step depinning picture is most appropriate in the upper right corner of the diagram .    to our knowledge",
    ", all existing measurements of the magnetic properties of ultrathin films on vicinal surfaces have been confined to a relatively small portion of our phase diagram .",
    "we encourage experiments designed to explore the remaining _ terra incognita_.",
