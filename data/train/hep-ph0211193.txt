    "four - fermion processes are generally considered as benchmark processes at high energy colliders , with electron positron annihilation into muon or quark pairs at lep and the drell yan process at hadron colliders as characteristic examples . at energies",
    "presently accessible , typically up to 200  gev , radiative corrections are dominated by the shift in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 masses as parametrized by the @xmath3 parameter and by the running of the coupling constant .",
    "vertex corrections and box diagrams involving gauge bosons are generally of minor importance . in the tev region ,",
    "which will be probed at future colliders like the lhc or tesla , this picture changes drastically .",
    "there , double logarithmic corrections become relevant and rapidly dominant .",
    "they were first observed by sudakov @xcite in the context of quantum electrodynamics for reactions with cuts on the radiated energy of the photons . for electroweak interactions ,",
    "the large negative corrections arise from the exchange of gauge bosons which remain uncompensated if one restricts the analysis to exclusive final states , consisting for instance of a fermion antifermion pair only .",
    "complete one - loop corrections to the four - fermion process are available since long ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . in recent years",
    ", the systematic study of double logarithmic electroweak corrections has received a lot of attention  @xcite , ( see @xcite for a review ) . while these studies are fairly straightforward for a theory with massive gauge bosons only , an important complication arises in the standard model due to the presence of massless photons in the final state .",
    "events with soft and hard photon radiation are normally included in the sample , thus a `` semi - inclusive '' definition of the cross section is closest to the experimental analysis .    at present",
    ", all large contributions up to the next - to - next - to - leading logarithms have been evaluated  @xcite for the form factor , for four - fermion scattering in a spontaneously broken @xmath4 gauge theory and , last not least , for the standard model with @xmath1 , @xmath2-bosons and the massless photon .",
    "in addition , other reactions have been investigated in the high energy limit , such as gauge boson pair production . there , the next - to - leading logarithmic terms have been calculated  @xcite for the exclusive production of transversly and longitudinally polarized @xmath1-bosons . but even in inclusive boson fusion processes ,",
    "enhanced electroweak corrections are present  @xcite , a consequence of the lack of compensation between virtual and real emission due to the non - abelian charges of the incoming particles .",
    "let us begin with a discussion of the form factor of an abelian vector current in the sudakov limit . in born approximation",
    ", one writes @xmath5 and we study the limit @xmath6 with on - shell massless fermions , @xmath7 , and massive gauge bosons , @xmath8 . for convenience",
    "we choose @xmath9 so that @xmath10 .",

    "the jet function @xmath13 contains the full dynamics of collinear momentum regions .",
    "it includes all leading logarithms .",
    "the soft function @xmath14 summarizes the dynamics of soft momenta , while the function @xmath12 describes the short distance dynamics of the hard scattering process .",
    "it contains no large logarithms .",
    "the predictive power of the factorized amplitude then follows from the properties of the individual functions .",
    "in particular , @xmath13 and @xmath14 can be defined in terms of operators , which obey renormalization group equations with calculable anomalous dimensions  @xcite .",

    "( [ eq : oneloopadim ] ) and ( [ eq : gamma2 ] ) , we see a particular pattern of growing coefficients of the logarithms , which reflects the general structure of logarithmically enhanced electroweak corrections",
    ". the relatively small coefficient of the leading logarithm and the large coefficient of the n@xmath31ll term in the form factor are clearly indicative of the importance of subleading logarithmic corrections . at n@xmath28ll accuracy ,",
    "the still unknown quantities @xmath32 and @xmath33 enter .    finally , we mention an equivalent approach to calculate the anomalous dimensions in eq .",

    "let us now investigate the four - fermion scattering at fixed angles in the limit when all the invariant energy and momentum transfers of the process are far larger than the gauge boson mass , @xmath34 .    for the analysis of the four - fermion amplitude , one has to account for the different `` color '' and lorentz structures , which naturally induce the dependence on @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "a complete basis consists of four independent chiral amplitudes , each of them of two possible `` color '' structures .",
    "let us denote by @xmath38 the amplitude with the collinear logarithms factored out .",
    "it contains only the logarithms of soft nature and can be represented as a vector in the color / chiral basis .",
    "it satisfies an evolution equation which is known from qcd  @xcite , @xmath39 here @xmath40 is the matrix of the soft anomalous dimensions , given for instance in @xcite , and the matrix elements of @xmath40 depend on the scattering angle through @xmath36 and @xmath37 . upon integration , eq .",

    "these angular dependent terms as well as those in the starting values of @xmath38 discussed below are important for the calculation of the n@xmath31ll terms in cross sections and asymmetries . to illustrate the significance of the subleading contributions , let us discuss a standard model inspired example such as the case of the @xmath46 group with @xmath47 and one scalar boson .",

    "again we observe a relatively small coefficient of the leading logarithm and the large coefficient of the n@xmath31ll term .    to analyze the electroweak correction to the process @xmath49 , the approximation with @xmath1 and @xmath2 bosons of the same mass @xmath50 , a higgs boson of the mass @xmath51 and massless quarks and leptons is employed .",
    "a fictitious photon mass @xmath52 has to be introduced to regularize the infrared divergences .",
    "the photon is , however , massless and the corresponding infrared divergent contributions should be accompanied by the real soft photon radiation integrated to some resolution energy @xmath53 to get an infrared safe cross section independent of an auxiliary photon mass . to study the virtual corrections in the limit of the vanishing photon mass the general approach of the infrared evolution equations developed in  @xcite",
    "( see also references therein ) is particularly useful .",

    "in view of the large subleading logarithms , it seems desirable to attempt the evaluation of all two - loop terms linear in the logarithm or even of the two - loop constant terms .    as a first step ,",
    "the corrections due to @xmath25 massless fermions and @xmath26 charged massless scalars in the fundamental representation have been calculated for the abelian form factor @xcite .",

    "we show the complete result as calculated in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fflogs - nf ] ) and the individual contributions of the large logarithms .",
    "we observe again the pattern of large cancellations between leading and subleading logarithms .    finally , we note that the fermionic contribution to @xmath67 at three loops has recently been calculated @xcite . together with the two - loop constant terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fflogs - nf ] ) , this result is a step towards the determination of the first five powers of logarithms of @xmath25-enhanced terms in the abelian form factor to all orders in perturbation theory .",
