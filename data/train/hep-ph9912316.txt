    "the model underpinning our calculations successfully gives a @xmath2 behavior in high energy @xmath3 scattering  @xcite .",
    "quarks and antiquarks are described by complex scalar fields @xmath4 , and gluons as the scalar field @xmath5 coupled through the lagrangian @xmath6 the quarks are massless , while the gluons are assigned a mass @xmath7 in order to avoid infra - red divergences . since in qcd",
    "the quartic interaction between gluons leads to terms which are sub - leading in ln @xmath8 , it is not included here .",
    "the two labels on each of the fields refer to the direct product of two color groups which is necessary to make the three gluon vertex symmetric under the exchange of two bosonic gluons .",
    "to describe non - equilibrium phenomena , we use the green functions of the schwinger - keldysh formalism  @xcite .",
    "the equations of motion for the wigner transforms of the green functions , the so - called transport and constraint equations , are derived  @xcite and read @xmath9 and @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a generic green function , @xmath12 for quarks and @xmath13 for gluons .",
    "@xmath14 is the appropriate mass , and @xmath15 is the collision term , @xmath16 @xmath17 and @xmath18 are terms containing retarded and advanced components : @xmath19 in eqs.([e : collision ] ) to ( [ e : pim ] ) , @xmath20 is a generic self - energy ( @xmath21 for quarks and @xmath22 for gluons ) and the operator @xmath23 is given by @xmath24 for the green functions , we use the quasiparticle approximation : @xmath25 @xmath26 is obtained from the expression for @xmath11 by replacing @xmath27 with @xmath28 and vice versa .",
    "@xmath29 is the quark ( @xmath30 ) or the gluon ( @xmath31 )    distribution function , @xmath32 is an abbreviation for @xmath33 .",
    "then an evolution equation for the parton distribution function is obtained by integrating eq.([e : transport ] ) over an interval @xmath34 that contains the energy @xmath35 .",
    "to lowest order in an expansion that sets @xmath36 , the integral for the collision term is performed in the next section .",
    "for the collision integral , one has @xmath37 _ i.e. _ the off - diagonal quasiparticle self - energies are required to be calculated on shell .    in the following , only the results for the quarks are presented , the generalization to the gluons is then obvious .",
    "the self - energies are organized now according to their number of loops .",
    "the hartree self - energies ( self - energy with a quark or a gluon loop ) vanish due to their color factors as it is the case for real qcd .",
    "the fock self - energy gives a contribution to the loss term of the collision integral in eq.([e : collint ] ) given by  @xcite @xmath38 here , @xmath39 means the scattering amplitude of the process @xmath1 of order @xmath40 which is pictured in fig.1 a ) .",
    "processes as @xmath41 , @xmath42 or @xmath43 are kinematically forbidden and therefore do not occur in this collision integral .",
    "the gain term can be obtained by exchanging @xmath27 with @xmath28 in eq.([e : lossint ] ) .",
    "the two loop self - energy graphs are pictured in fig.2 . according to their topology ,",
    "they are called rainbow ( r ) , ladder ( l ) , cloud ( c ) , exchange ( e ) and quark - loop ( ql ) graphs .",
    "let us first consider the contribution of the seven diagrams ra ) , la ) , ca ) , cb ) , ea ) , eb ) and qla ) to the collision integral .",
    "the first five of these diagrams lead to the ( lowest order ) scattering amplitudes of the processes @xmath44 and @xmath45 , while the latter two lead to the ( lowest order ) scattering amplitudes of the processes @xmath46 and @xmath47  @xcite .",
    "thus , to obtain _ all _ possible @xmath48 processes it is necessary to consider all types of diagrams .",
    "but an analysis of the color factors shows that the quark - loop diagrams are subleading as it is the case in real qcd .",
    "therefore , in an additional expansion in the inverse number of colors , @xmath49 , one can neglect the processes @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "that means that gluon production is favored .",
    "the three diagrams rd ) , ld ) and qld ) vanish due to the momentum structure of their propagators  @xcite .    to see the purpose of the remaining ten diagrams  @xcite , i.e. rb ) , rc ) ,",
    "lb ) , lc ) , cc ) , cd ) , ec ) , ed ) , qlb ) and qlc ) , we investigate first the process @xmath1 which is shown up to order @xmath50 in fig.1 .",
    "@xmath51 was given in lowest order by the fock term .",
    "to construct it up to order @xmath52 , one has to take the hermitian conjugate of the scattering amplitude of fig.1a ) and multiply it with each of the scattering amplitudes of fig.1b)-g ) .",
    "it is also necessary to take the hermitian conjugate of each of these products , too . using a symbolical notation , we write these products as @xmath53 .",
    "then a detailed analysis shows that each of these products , with the exception of @xmath54 and @xmath55 , is provided by one of the above mentioned ten self - energy diagrams .",
    "the diagram g ) of fig.1 does not enter into the collision integral , as it is a renormalization diagram for the incoming quark , for which the momentum @xmath56 is fixed externally .",
    "so far , we have constructed the collision integral out of self - energy diagrams with graphs up to two loops .",
    "let us now return to the transport equation ( [ e : transport ] ) . if we integrate the left hand side over the interval @xmath34 and neglect the contributions of @xmath57 and @xmath58 on the right hand side , then we get for the transport equation up to order @xmath52 @xmath59.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the generalization to higher orders is then obvious .",
    "including , e.g. , the three loop self - energy into the collision term leads to cross sections of all kinematically allowed processes with two ( three ) partons in the initial state and three ( two ) partons in the final state .",
    "furthermore , they give all additional corrections of order @xmath60 to the process @xmath1 , e.g.  the product of scattering amplitudes of the diagrams b)-f ) in fig.2 , and also corrections to the scattering processes of two partons into two partons .",
    "one may speculate that pinch singularities could enter into the collision integral up to the two loop level .",
    "in fact this is not so , and has been explicitly demonstrated  @xcite .",
