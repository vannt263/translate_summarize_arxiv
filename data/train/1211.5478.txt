    "historically , the main goal in the study of a differential equation of mechanics was to integrate it , to find the explicit solution .",
    "the fact of the existence of principally non - integrable systems has shifted the accent to qualitative methods of investigation . however , during the last 20 years new algebraic approaches to construct or reveal the integrable systems were created . for hamiltonian systems ,",
    "many new cases of commutative and non - commutative integrability were found .",
    "a lot of them deal with the problem of the rotation of a rigid body about a fixed point and its generalizations to lie groups that differ from @xmath0 . here lies one of the reasons for a new wave of mathematical interest in the integrable hamiltonian systems .",
    "note the books @xcite published lately and containing more than a thousand of references on the matter . in relatively recent studies , the integrable systems with three or more degrees of freedom were found not having continuous symmetries and therefore not reducible as a whole to families of systems with two degrees of freedom ( the so - called irreducible systems ) .",
    "one of the most ingenious and complicated example of the integrable irreducible system is the generalized kowalevski gyrostat .",
    "it is a rigid body with a rotor satisfying the conditions of the kowalevski type and placed in two independent constant fields , say , gravitational and magnetic .",
    "this case was found due to the efforts of several mathematicians .",
    "we note the works of o.i.bogoyavlensky @xcite , h.m.yehia @xcite , l.n.gavrilov @xcite , i.v.komarov @xcite .",
    "the final and mostly general result was obtained by a.g.reyman and m.a.semenov-tian-shansky @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it appeared that no explicit solutions in the classical sense can be found for the general case .",
    "up - to - date the only progress in studying the reyman ",
    "semenov - tian - shansky case is based on the idea of investigating critical subsystems .",
    "this row of publications starts from the work @xcite , in which the bogoyavlensky system generalizing the 1st appelrot class is investigated without any connection to the general case , and the work @xcite , in which the next generalization , of the 2nd and 3d appelrot classes , was found .",
    "later , the bifurcation diagrams of the partial cases and of the general case including the case of a gyrostat were built and classified in the space of parameters and with respect to the energy levels in the series of works @xcite .",
    "the complete description was obtained for the critical set of the momentum mapping stratified according to various criteria @xcite . for two critical subsystems generalizing the famous appelrot classes separations of variables",
    "were found and the phase topology was investigated in @xcite , all critical periodic motions were described analytically and integrated in elliptic functions for the cases of a top @xcite and of a gyrostat @xcite . from the integrability point of view , each of the critical subsystems found is as general as the whole kowalevski case in the gravity field , i.e. , generates a one - parametric family of hamiltonian systems with two degrees of freedom .",
    "these systems have all the features of the systems in which separation of variables is obtained algebraically . here",
    "we call such systems algebraically solvable .",
    "we present though the _",
    "geometrical _ ideas of how to construct such separations",
    ".    a lot of publications deal with the notion of an algebraic complete integrable systems .",
    "this notion does not have a unique and exact definition .",
    "usually it is associated with hamiltonian systems the topology of which is connected with the jacobians and prim varieties of algebraic surfaces .",
    "algebraic complete integrable systems with known separation of variables usually also have algebraic expressions of the initial phase variables in terms of the separated ones , although many contemporary papers , not like the classical works , do not pay much attention to this point .",
    "we think that a system with separated variables can not be considered completely analytically integrated without explicit expressions for the phase variables .",
    "separations of variables on algebraic curves generated by lax representations , the existence of which is theoretically proved , do not provide any method to establish the connection with the initial variables . here",
    "we use another approach  starting from the geometry of initial variables and trying to find such projections of the phase space which bring the integral manifolds to the most simple image . if it is done ( and there are no general ways to do it ) , then the connection with the initial variables is kept from the beginning . in this paper",
    "we propose the projections and the coordinate systems that made it possible to find new algebraically and topologically interesting separations of variables .",
    "the examples given below show the valuable applications .",
    "the term we use here  algebraically solvable systems  is not a standard one .",
    "let us give some explanations of the problem .",
    "consider a system of differential equations on a submanifold @xmath1 in a real vector space @xmath2 defining the evolution of the set of phase variables @xmath3 and admitting separation of variables @xmath4 where @xmath5 are so - called auxiliary or separated variables .",
    "we denote the vector of these variables by @xmath6 .",
    "the functions @xmath7 are supposed to be polynomials in one variable @xmath8 with coefficients depending on a set of arbitrary constants @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the `` reduced time '' connected with the real time @xmath11 by the equation of the type @xmath12 .",
    "usually such separation has a mechanical origin , therefore equations ( [ neq2_2 ] ) have the form of an energy integral .",
    "moreover , we suppose that all phase variables @xmath13 are expressed via the separated variables by rational functions with respect to the set of radicals @xmath14 with coefficients smoothly depending on @xmath6 .",
    "the set of numbers @xmath15 depending , of course , on the constants @xmath9 includes also the roots of @xmath16 .",
    "the classical examples show that the roots of @xmath16 usually provide the whole set of  @xmath17 .",
    "the vector @xmath9 for the system ( [ neq2_1 ] ) usually appears as a collection of arbitrary constants of some set of first integrals @xmath18 .",
    "the dependencies @xmath19 then are considered as the multi - valued parametric equations of an integral manifold @xmath20 . here",
    "@xmath21 is the region in the separated variables space filled with trajectories of ( [ neq2_2 ] ) for given  @xmath9 . in russian , it is traditionally called by the term corresponding to `` the region of the possibility of motions '' @xcite , which sounds not very elegant .",
    "a shorter term `` accessible region '' was introduced in english translations and completely reflects the situation .",
    "notation of the region @xmath21 for the argument vector @xmath22 in ( [ neq2_4 ] ) is based on this term .",
    "let the system ( [ neq2_1 ] ) be a hamiltonian complete integrable system with two degrees of freedom and @xmath23 be its integral mapping of compact character ( the inverse image of a compact set is compact ) .",
    "two degrees of freedom are chosen to simplify notation and because of the main examples below .",
    "[ thdef21 ] the set @xmath24 is called the admissible region @xmath25 in the space of integral constants@xmath26 a point @xmath27 is called an admissible point if and only if @xmath28 .    generally speaking , separation of variables is some mapping @xmath29 of the phase space to the plane of the auxiliary variables @xmath30 that takes the system ( [ neq2_1 ] ) to the system ( [ neq2_2 ] ) with @xmath31 . for any admissible @xmath9",
    "we obtain the mapping @xmath32    [ thdef22 ] for a given @xmath9 the set @xmath33 is called an accessible region in the plane of the separated variables .",
    "it is clear that @xmath21 is a subset of @xmath34 and any point is included in @xmath21 with its total connected component in the set ( [ neq2_8 ] ) .",
    "then @xmath21 is a collection of rectangular regions in the @xmath35-plane ; `` infinite rectangles '' ( half - strips , strips or even quadrants ) are also possible .",
    "the fact that the accessible region is rectangular for all integral constants , obviously , is the necessary condition of separation of variables .",
    "possibly , supposing that the projection of the type ( [ neq2_7 ] ) is non - trivial in some sense or that the boundaries of accessible regions essentially depend on @xmath36 in terms of the corresponding jacobians , one can prove that this fact is also sufficient , but here we do not consider such a goal .",
    "we want to understand in which way to look for separations of variables .",
    "note that separation of variables not always has the form of a global mapping ( [ neq2_6 ] ) .",
    "as far as the dynamics of a rigid body is concerned , separations not depending on integral constants are known for the euler case ( one independent variable can also be treated as a separation ) , the goryachev  chaplygin case and its generalization to a gyrostat given by l.n.sretensky @xcite , the clebsch case with zero momentum constant ( isomorphic to the neumann problem ) . already in the kowalevski case @xcite ,",
    "the change of variables leading to separation essentially uses the integral equations .",
    "however , having the mapping ( [ neq2_7 ] ) for _ all _ @xmath36 one can formally substitute @xmath37 to obtain some mapping of the type ( [ neq2_6 ] ) .",
    "it is important to mention that practically in all cases separation of variables is not built straightforwardly in the form ( [ neq2_6 ] ) . as a rule",
    ", some intermediate mapping @xmath38 is constructed first .",
    "let us call this auxiliary plane of the variables @xmath39 _ the picture plane_. with the projection onto the picture plane , the separated variables are introduced as the functions of @xmath40 ( usually defined by some implicit equations ) .",
    "what is the geometry behind this construction ?",
    "the mapping of the phase space to the picture plane takes an integral manifold to a region @xmath41 bounded by some curves .",
    "if these curves could be included in a two - parametric family of curves on the plane @xmath42 and this family could serve as a local coordinate net , then in these coordinates the image of each integral manifold would be a rectangle .",
    "therefore , the new coordinates satisfy the necessary condition of a separation and we obtain hope to build such a separation .",
    "at this moment it absolutely does not matter whether this coordinate net was built by a global change of variables or , as in the kowalevski case , this net ( the zhukovsky net ) depends in a very complicated way on the integral constants .    studying the projections of @xmath43 onto the picture plane ( or in more general case onto some picture manifold with dimension equal to the number of degrees of freedom )",
    "we must have in mind that @xmath43 itself may not have a global coordinate system .",
    "for example , in the rigid body dynamics @xmath44 with the matrix group @xmath0 naturally embedded in @xmath45 by means of the so - called direction cosines .",
    "any system of three coordinates either not covers @xmath0 or has inevitable singularities ( like the euler angles or their modifications ) .",
    "it is one of the reasons to consider @xmath43 as a subset in a vector space @xmath46 of sufficiently high dimension presenting it as the level surface of some mapping @xmath47 in the rigid body dynamics this mapping is formed by the so - called geometric integrals , and in the theory of the euler equations on lie algebras this role is given to the casimir functions .    combining ( [ neq2_5 ] ) with @xmath48",
    "we obtain each integral manifold as a level surface of the new , enhanced , integral mapping @xmath49 where @xmath46 and @xmath50 are real vector spaces and @xmath41 coincides with @xmath51 , @xmath52 . by an appropriate choice of coordinates",
    "we can represent @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the picture plane , and replace the projection of @xmath43 onto the picture plane with the projection of @xmath46 onto the first multiplier @xmath55 .",
    "this construction is easily generalized to the case when @xmath56 are smooth manifolds . in",
    "axially symmetric problems of the rigid body dynamics the manifold @xmath54 is often identified with the so - called poisson sphere @xmath57 .",
    "then instead of @xmath58 we have a similar region @xmath59 to construct coordinate nets on the picture plane we need to investigate the boundaries of accessible regions , not only in the topological sense , but the curves that in geometry and in the wave fronts theory are called visible contours .",
    "[ thdef23 ] @xcite .",
    "the generalized boundary of an accessible region @xmath60 is the set of critical values of the mapping @xmath61    to find generalized boundaries one needs , in particular , to solve the equation @xmath62 .",
    "the following result @xcite helps to avoid this sometimes impossible procedure .",
    "[ th21 ] let @xmath63 .",
    "denote by @xmath64 the restriction of the operator @xmath65 onto the subspace @xmath66 .",
    "the image of the point @xmath67 belongs to the generalized boundary of the accessible region @xmath68 if and only if @xmath69    naturally , this statement is of practical use only if @xmath70 , which is equivalent to @xmath71 . in global coordinates on @xmath46 and @xmath50 ,",
    "the condition for @xmath72 is easy to write in terms of the corresponding jacobi matrix .",
    "we tend to apply the above ideas to the system of equations describing the rotation of a rigid body about a fixed point in the linear potential force field @xmath73 here @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 are the phase variables , the constant vectors @xmath77 and the diagonal constant matrix @xmath78 are the physical parameters .",
    "the geometric integrals forming the corresponding mapping @xmath79 are @xmath80 .",
