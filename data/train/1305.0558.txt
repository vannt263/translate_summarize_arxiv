    "section 4 contains our summary and conclusions .",
    "we rely on two catalogs of star clusters brighter than @xmath18 = 23 mag , detected by @xcite , based on hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) observations acquired by the hubble heritage team .",
    "@xcite compiled two catalogs , one of 2224  class 1 \" clusters , that appear circular and well isolated , and one with 1388  class 2 \" clusters , which have elongated or irregular shapes and/or close neighbors",
    ". these original catalogs list , among other properties , cluster ra and dec , half - light radius @xmath19 , ( @xmath20 ) and ( @xmath21 ) colors , aperture corrected @xmath22 mag , and photometric errors , all in the _ hst _ equivalent of the johnson system . from the recovery of artificial clusters",
    ", @xcite determined that the completeness of clusters with @xmath23 mag is higher than 80% , regardless of the clustering properties of the field .",
    "subsequently , @xcite calculated masses , ages , and reddening for the clusters , via the comparison of their broad band , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 filters .",
    "@xcite complemented these with archival @xmath26 wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) data . ]",
    "spectral energy distributions ( seds ) with theoretical seds derived from the @xcite stellar population synthesis models .",
    "the models used by @xcite have a salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) , with lower and upper mass cutoffs of 0.1 @xmath27 and 100 @xmath27 , respectively ; ages between 1 myr and 15 gyr ; and solar metallicity .",
    "each one of the 182 model spectra was reddened by @xmath28 values between 0.0 and 0.6 in 40 0.015 mag steps .",
    "] the age and reddening of each cluster were determined simultaneously , from a @xmath29 fit of the reddened model seds to the photometric data .",
    "the original catalogs were thus reduced to 1125 class 1 and 835 class 2 objects with acceptable fits . for each cluster ,",
    "a mass was finally assigned from the mass to light ratio @xmath30 of the best - fit model and the @xmath22-band cluster magnitude , taking the measured extinction into account and adopting a distance to m  51 of 8.4 mpc @xcite .",
    "40.7 pc ; @xmath31 , the galactocentric distance of the isophote with surface brightness in the @xmath32-band @xmath33 mag @xmath34 , is 13.7 kpc or @xmath35 . ] the @xcite catalogs list , for each cluster , log age and errors , log mass , color excess and errors , and @xmath29 value of the best - fit .",
    "these catalogs do not provide an error in the mass determination .",
    "one possible estimate is given by the @xmath30 ratios at the minimum and maximum ages ( the age minus and plus its error , respectively ) of each cluster .",
    "except for 24 ( out of 1960 ) clusters ( half of them less massive than @xmath36 ) , this error is smaller than 0.15 dex ( 35% of the mass ) in all cases .",
    "the dominant source of error is probably the uncertainty in the distance modulus ( 0.6 mag , or a factor of @xmath37 2 in mass ) .",
    "it would affect all the masses equally , though , so it would not change the exponent of any relationship between cluster mass and gas or sfr surface density .",
    "the age distribution of the clusters shows three peaks , that likely signpost bursts of enhanced star formation rate , respectively , at stellar ages of @xmath38 5 , 100 , and 200 myr .",
    "the two older starbursts are better traced by the detected class 1 objects , which have masses ranging from @xmath39 to @xmath40 .",
    "conversely , detected clusters in the recent burst belong mostly to class 2 , with significantly lower masses , between @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "since m  51 is a grand - design spiral with large azimuthal variations of gas surface density , a two - dimensional approach is required , as opposed to a comparison of individual cluster masses with radial gas profiles , that was adequate for m  33 .",
    "we use the hi map of m  51 data from @xcite ; it was originally acquired with the very large array ( vla ) and has a spatial resolution of 13@xmath43 .",
    "we derive the molecular gas surface density distribution from the @xmath44co 21 mosaic obtained by @xcite with the iram-30 m telescope ; it has a resolution of 11@xmath43 . finally , to calculate the sfr surface density distribution we rely on the total power 20 cm radio continuum image published by @xcite ; it has a resolution of 15@xmath43 , and was produced from vla c- and d - array data .    in order to get the h@xmath45 , hi , and sfr surface densities from the integrated intensity maps , we follow the same procedures as @xcite . at a given position in m  51 , the neutral gas surface density @xmath46(hi ) cos  @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the hydrogen atomic mass and @xmath49 is the inclination angle of m  51 ; assuming optically thin emission , @xmath50(hi ) = @xmath51/(k km s@xmath52)@xmath53",
    "likewise , we obtain the molecular gas surface density as @xmath54(h@xmath45 ) cos  @xmath47 .",

    "the 20 cm non - thermal radio continuum is due to synchrotron radiation by supernovae - accelerated cosmic rays ; it hence traces recent star formation , and has a strong correlation with the far - infrared ( fir ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . can be readily derived from fir emission , given that a significant amount of it is due to reprocessing by dust of light from young stars ; fir emission also has the advantage that it does not need to be corrected for extinction .",
    "in fact , @xcite find that sfrs obtained at optical and uv wavelengths are often overcorrected for extinction , since stellar balmer absorption contaminates emission lines ; optical / uv and fir / mm sfr estimators agree well once this effect is taken into account .",
    "] at the position of each star cluster , gas surface densities are obtained from the hi , h@xmath45 , and 20 cm mosaics averaging , respectively , the emission over @xmath61 ( @xmath62 pc@xmath63 ) , @xmath64 ( @xmath65 pc@xmath63 ) , and @xmath64 . on the side ; the smallest area over which we can average the flux is a subarray of 3@xmath663 pixels ( sides of subarrays must have an odd number of pixels ) , centered on the position of each cluster .",
    "we match the elements over which we average the hi and 20 cm fluxes to this @xmath67 footprint as closely as is allowed by the pixel sizes of the images , respectively , @xmath68 ( arrays with 5 pixels on the side ) and @xmath69 ( arrays of 9 @xmath66 9 square pixels ) . ]",
    "ninety - five of the clusters in the sample have coordinates that fall outside of the borders of the radio images , so that only 1865 objects can be compared with the gas and sfr densities at their location in the m  51 disk .",
    "@xcite find that the completeness distribution is quite similar for both class 1 and class 2 clusters . since cluster brightness in the optical diminishes with age , the completeness limit of the cluster mass function depends on cluster age .",
    "based on their photometric completeness limits , @xcite determine that conservative limits over which their mass functions are not affected by incompleteness are @xmath70 for clusters younger than 10@xmath71 , and at least 1@xmath72 for clusters between 100 and 250 myr .",
    "we will first work with the 167 clusters in the catalogs with at least @xmath73 , ages between 40 and 400 myr , yr old burst reaches 25 myr , but no cluster in this group that is younger than 40 myr makes the @xmath73 cut . ] and detected co , hi , and 20 cm emission at their present locations . @xcite and @xcite",

    "similar results are found for the magellanic clouds @xcite and the antena galaxies @xcite .",
    "the implication is that the mass - dependent disruption timescale is @xmath75 2 gyr @xcite .",
    "we take care here to compare cluster mass with gas and sfr surface density always in bins with the same number of clusters , in order to test whether any change in maximum cluster mass is a statistical , size - of - sample effect .",
    "we search for correlations between cluster mass , and gas and sfr surface densities of the form : @xmath76    where @xmath77 is the mass of the @xmath47-th most massive star cluster , and @xmath78 stands for hi , h2 , total gas or sfr .",

    "by contrast , 257 out of the 258 clusters kept for the final analysis in m  33 are younger than 2.5@xmath172 yr ( the age of the exception is 60 myr ) and , at any rate , the lack of a strong spiral perturbation means that the azimuthally averaged gas emission is in general representative of the star - forming conditions of clusters located at the same radii .    to be able to perform a statistically significant analysis of clusters younger than 25 myr , still close to their birthsites and whose local gas densities resemble their star - forming environments , the depth and resolution of the cluster data need to be enough for the assembly of a sufficiently numerous sample above the mass function completeness limit",
    ". the gas data should also have a resolution comparable to the physical sizes of the clusters .",
    "the confirmation of the m  33 results will have to wait for the outcome of studies in closer targets , like the magellanic clouds , where the mass density distribution of clusters younger than a few @xmath172 yr can be probed with large numbers down to 100 - 1000 @xmath27 , and where the clusters physical sizes are well matched by the resolution achievable at radio wavelengths ; the data to do so already exist .",
