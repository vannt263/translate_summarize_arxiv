    "the kagome lattice is comprised of corner - sharing triangles in two - dimensions ( fig .",
    "its unique geometry , which combines low dimensionality , low connectivity , and high geometrical frustration , makes it an ideal lattice for realizing exotic states .",
    "for example , the quantum spin liquid ( qsl ) state @xcite has been proposed for several kagome lattice materials with either heisenberg spins for herbertsmithite zncu@xmath10(oh)@xmath11cl@xmath12 @xcite , vesignieite bacu@xmath10v@xmath12o@xmath13(oh)@xmath12 @xcite and related polymorph @xcite ; or with coplanar spins for langasites @xcite and supramolecular structures@xcite . for most of these systems ,",
    "lattice distortion or structural disorder @xcite complicates an interpretation of the intrinsic kagome lattice physics , whose effects are largely omitted by theoretical approaches .",
    "importantly , theories of qsls predict a wide variety of states @xcite , suggesting that tunability of materials parameters will be determinative .",
    "the systems mentioned above represent singular points in a broader phase space of possible ground states , which limits the accuracy of interpretation .",
    "it is therefore essential to explore new kagome lattice materials with tunable material parameters and little disorder .",
    "recently , a new family of compounds , a@xmath0re@xmath1sb@xmath1o@xmath2 ( a = mg , zn , co , mn ; re = rare earth elements ) @xcite , has been discovered which features an ideal rare earth kagome lattice , namely , the  tripod kagome lattice \" ( tkl ) @xcite .",
    "below , we use the abbreviated name , _ a - re _ , for the tkls , such as _ mgpr _ for mg@xmath0pr@xmath1sb@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "the tkl is a variant of the pyrochlore lattice @xcite through partial ion substitution , for which the triangular layers in the pyrochlore lattice along the [ 111 ] axis are substituted by a@xmath14 ions , resulting in 2d re@xmath15 kagome layers that are separated by a@xmath14 triangular layers . in this new structure ,",
    "the nearest neighbor re - re distance within each kagome layer ( @xmath8 3.7  ) is much smaller than that of the distance between layers ( @xmath8 6.2  ) . given the good interlayer separation , it is clear that for tkls with a nonmagnetic a site ( a = mg , zn ) , the dominant magnetic interaction is in the layer , enabling the study of pure kagome physics .    while the two - dimensionality of the tkl lattice controls the interactions , the single ion anisotropy , which is vestigial from the parent pyrochlore structure , gives rise to different spin types ( ising , heisenberg , and @xmath16 ) for different re ions with the ising spins or the @xmath16-spin normal vectors that are neither uniaxial nor uniplanar @xcite .",
    "this particular situation of three distinct tripod - like axes distinguishes the tkl from other kagome lattice materials that possess either heisenberg or coplanar spins , and potentially gives rise to a variety of different states @xcite .",
    "indeed , various such states have already been revealed by recent studies of four compounds of the tkl family : ( i ) with heisenberg spins in _ mggd _ , the system shows a long - range ordering ( lro ) at 1.65 k , which is consistent with a 120 @xmath17 structure .",
    "it provides an example of dipolar interaction mandated spin ordering in a 2d system @xcite .",
    "( ii ) with ising spins in _ mgdy _ , a phase transition at @xmath18 @xmath8 0.3 k @xcite ( @xmath18 = 0.37 k in ref .",
    "@xcite ) could be related to an ordering among emergent magnetic charge degrees of freedom while a fraction of spin moments remain disordered .",
    "such emergent charge order ( eco ) has been proposed theoretically @xcite , but has never before been experimentally realized .",
    "( iii ) for _ mgnd _ , lro with an all - in - all - out state is observed at @xmath18 = 0.56 k , which may be stabilized by dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions @xcite .",
    "( iv ) two transitions at 2.1 k and 80 mk are observed in _ mger _",
    "@xcite where local @xmath16 spins are preserved .",
    "the first transition is possibly related to a kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) vortex unbinding transition .    besides the four examples mentioned above , other members of the _ mgre _ family , such as re = pr , tb , ho , yb , could prove interesting . in the parent pyrochlore compounds with these four re elements , different ground states",
    "have been reported , including a qsl @xcite , a dipolar spin ice @xcite , exchange spin ices @xcite and a quantum spin ice @xcite .",
    "what states will occur when confined to two - dimensions with one of the frustrating spins removed ?",
    "moreover , what are the low temperature magnetic properties of the same systems , with marginally larger in - plane lattice constants , such as is realized with _",
    "znre _ ? in this tkl branch",
    ", the larger zn@xmath14 ion is expected to modify the spin - spin interaction energies , akin to applying  chemical pressure \" and thus allows rigorous theoretical tests of the low energy phases .",
    "such chemical pressure has been proved to be crucial for selecting ground states in er and yb pyrochlores @xcite .",
    "the questions raised above provide ample motivation for a systematic exploration of the large range of compounds based on the tkl structure .    in this manuscript , we synthesized and studied the structural and magnetic properties of two branches of the rare earth tkl family a@xmath0re@xmath1sb@xmath1o@xmath2 ( a = mg , zn ; re = pr , nd , gd , tb , dy , ho , er , yb ) with nonmagnetic a site . by combining the experimental probes of x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) , dc and ac susceptibility ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) , and specific heat ( @xmath19 ) , we show various magnetic ground states for tkls with different re ions . by replacing mg with zn ,",
    "we show that the chemical pressure has a small effect on the magnetic properties for tkls with larger re ions .",
    "we do observe , however , a seeming increase of site - disorder for tkls with smaller re ions by zn replacement , leading to dramatic changes of ground states compared to those in the mg branch .",
    "polycrystalline samples of a@xmath0re@xmath1sb@xmath1o@xmath2 ( a = mg , zn ; re = pr , nd , gd , tb , dy , ho , er , yb ) were synthesized by solid state reactions from powder of re@xmath12o@xmath10 ( re = nd , gd , dy , ho , er , yb ) / pr@xmath11o@xmath20 / tb@xmath21o@xmath22 , sb@xmath12o@xmath10 , and mgo / zno . for the zn@xmath0re@xmath1sb@xmath1o@xmath2 family ,",
    "stoichiometric mixtures were carefully ground and reacted at a temperature of 1200 @xmath17c in air for 3 days with several intermediate grindings , in a manner described previously @xcite .",
    "for the mg@xmath0re@xmath1sb@xmath1o@xmath2 family , a higher reaction temperature of 1300 - 1350 @xmath17c is required to obtain pure tkl phases @xcite .",
    "the room temperature xrd patterns were measured with a huber x - ray powder diffractometer with the structural refinements performed using software package _ fullprof - suite_. the @xmath3 measurements were performed using a commercial superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) magnetometer with a magnetic field of 0.05 t. the @xmath4 was measured at the national high magnetic field laboratory using the conventional mutual inductance technique at frequencies between 80 hz and 1000 hz .",
    "the low temperature @xmath19 measurements were performed in a he3-he4 dilution refrigerator using the semi - adiabatic heat pulse technique .",
    "the powder samples were cold - sintered with ag powder , the contribution of which was measured separately and subtracted from the data .",
    "for all the @xmath19 data shown below , the magnetic contribution ( c@xmath23 ) was obtained by subtracting a lattice contribution estimated from the results of a separate measurement of the non - magnetic isomorph zn@xmath12la@xmath10sb@xmath10o@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "as described in our previous work @xcite , the tkl is a kagome lattice based on partial ion substitution in the pyrchlore lattice . compared with the pyrochlore lattice ,",
    "one fourth of the rare earth ions are substituted by nonmagnetic mg@xmath14 or zn@xmath14 ( fig 1.(a ) ) , resulting in ordered kagome layers ( fig 1.(b ) ) that are well separated by nonmagnetic triangular mg or zn layers and with alternating abc stacking arrangement .",
    "more importantly , because of the similar local oxygen environment of the re ion compared to that of the parent pyrochlore structure , we expect a similar crystal field splitting of the 4f ground state , resulting in either ising spins or @xmath16-spin vectors that are neither uniaxial nor uniplanar . as shown in fig .",
    "1 , there are three ising axes for each kagome layer that are joining each re ion to the o1 ion that are located at the center of the tetrahedron ( thus the local @xmath16 plane is the one that is perpendicular to the local ising axes ) .",
    "it is this lack of a unique crystal axis that is neither parallel or perpendicular to the individual ising axes of the distorted re polyhedra that warrants use of the modifier  tripod \" to avoid confusion with uniaxial ( coplanar ) kagome lattices .",
    "such tripod - like axes will also be crucial for understanding of the low temperature magnetism for each re - tkl .",
    "the tkl compounds crystallize in a rhombohedral structure with r -3 m space group in hexagonal expression .",
    "a detailed crystallographic description of the tkl structure can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "for the a = mg branch , xrd patterns of all eight compounds ( re = pr , nd , gd , tb , dy , ho , er , yb ) can be well - fitted by the tkl structure described earlier @xcite .",
    "the associated crystallographic table with selected bond lengths are listed in table .",
    "[ tab:1 ] .",
    "the xrd patterns for two end members , _ mgpr _ with the largest re ionic radius and _ mgyb _ with smallest re ionic radius among those we prepared , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mg_xrd ] . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lattice ] , the lattice parameters decrease smoothly as the re ionic radius decreases in agreement with a previous report @xcite .    for the a = zn branch ,",
    "the xrd patterns for compounds with larger re ionic radii ( re = pr , nd , gd , tb , dy ) closely correspond to the tkl structure while some discrepancies are observed for compounds with smaller ionic radius ( re = ho , er , yb ) .",
    "this finding agrees with a previous report in which attempts to synthesize materials with the tkl structure based on smaller rare earth ions were unsuccessful @xcite . for comparison ,",
    "the xrd patterns for two compounds with nearby re@xmath15 ions on the periodic table , _ zndy _ and _ znho _ , are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : zn_xrd ] . in general , the xrd pattern of _ znho _ is similar to that of _ zndy _ in terms of the positions and intensity ratios of the main reflections .",
    "however , some weak reflections such as the ( 012 ) , ( 110 ) , and ( 104 ) bragg peaks ( marked by the arrows in fig . [ fig : zn_xrd](b ) ) observed for _ zndy _ are not present in the _ znho _ data .",
    "the difference between _ zndy _ and _ znho _ can be explained by zn / ho site disorder . with the similar tkl structure ,",
    "it is the site mixing of zn and ho ions that reduces the distinctness of their original positions , increases the crystallographic symmetries , and results in a reduction of the number of bragg reflections .",
    "assuming total site mixing of zn / ho with 40% zn and 60% ho occupancy at their original wyckoff site in a tkl , a xrd simulation will give zero intensity for the ( 012 ) , ( 110 ) , ( 104 ) bragg peaks if one ignores the weak scattering from oxygen .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : zn_xrd](b ) , a rietvelt refinement based on a total zn / ho site disorder model fits the xrd pattern reasonably well except for some small discrepancies that are likely due to unstable oxygen positions in the refinement @xcite .",
    "lattice parameters for the zn - tkl branch are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lattice ] . a clear jump is observed between _",
    "zndy _ and _ znho _ for @xmath24 , showing that site disorder expands the lattice within the @xmath25 plane .",
    "such site disorder is not totally unexpected when we move from lower to higher @xmath26 in the 4f row . as we do so , the ionic radius of re@xmath15 decreases , and finally at ho , it becomes insufficient to be distinguished from the zn@xmath14 ions when re goes beyond during the sample synthesis at high temperature .",
    "similar behavior has been reported for ca@xmath0re@xmath1sb@xmath1o@xmath2 where the ca / re site disorder is present for all re compounds of the ca branch @xcite . in order to distinguish these site - disordered lattices from other site - ordered ones",
    ", we will add a notation `` @xmath27 '' before the chemical formula for disordered lattice ( e.g. @xmath27__znho _ _ ) in the following sections .",
    "it is also possible that some slight a / re disorder exists in the other compounds . within the experimental resolution",
    ", the refinements based on our xrd patterns generally give 1 - 5% a / re site disorder for other tkl members of the zn branch ( re = pr , nd , gd , tb , dy ) and all tkls of the mg branch .",
    "similar to the disorder effects found in other frustrated magnets , such a / re site disorder in the tkl structure is likely to modify the spin - spin correlations , and tune the fragile low temperature ground state .",
    "as shown below , the total zn / er disorder in @xmath27__zner _ _ results in a spin glass ( sg ) ground state .",
    "it is also noteworthy that a small level of site disorder is likely to play an important role .",
    "for example , by comparing two separate reports of _ mgdy _",
    "@xcite , the difference of the eco ordering temperatures ( @xmath8 0.3 k in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath8 0.37 k in ref .",
    "@xcite ) and the sharpness of the transition peaks in @xmath19 can be attributed to the different percentages of mg / dy site disorder which might come from different reaction environments during sample synthesis .        by substituting the smaller mg@xmath14 ions with the larger zn@xmath14 ions on the non - magnetic a - site in the tkls , we introduce chemical pressure that enlarges both lattice parameters @xmath24 and @xmath28 .",
    "principally , this effect is expected to reduce both the exchange and dipolar interactions . in the pyrochlores ,",
    "this chemical pressure effect has been proven effective for determining the magnetic ground states .",
    "for example , by replacing the ti site with a smaller ge ion or a larger sn ion , the chemical pressure effect selects different magnetic ground states in the pyrochlore systems yb@xmath12x@xmath12o@xmath22 and er@xmath12x@xmath12o@xmath22 ( x = ge , ti , sn ) @xcite .    in the tkl system ,",
    "an obvious result of chemical pressure is the structural change . as discussed above ,",
    "while the a / re site disorder is low in the mg - branch and zn - branch with re ions of larger size , a severe zn / re site disorder is present for tkls with smaller re ions ( re = ho , er , yb ) .",
    "this type of site disorder destroys the kagome lattice and introduces a random distribution of re ions with 3d correlation , which will result in a different magnetic ground state .    for tkls where the site disorder is small ( re = pr",
    ", nd , gd , tb , dy ) , the chemical pressure seems to have little effect on the low temperature magnetism in both branches . both _",
    "mgpr _ and _ mgpr _ have non - magnetic ground states .",
    "we found lro in the nd , gd and dy compounds in both mg and zn branches with similar ordering temperatures ( tab .",
    "[ tab:2 ] ) , consistent with the small lattice constant differences .",
    "no lro is observed in both _",
    "mgtb _ and _ zntb_. it is noteworthy that some subtle differences have been observed .",
    "for example , while _ mgtb _ shows a broad sro - like feature in @xmath29 at 400 mk , no such feature is seen in _",
    "zntb_. in fig .",
    "[ fig : tb](c ) , @xmath30 also shows some difference above 400 mk between the two .",
    "another example is that for _ mgnd _ , the zero field @xmath29 seems indicate a two - step transition , while for _ znnd _ , a small magnetic dc field is required to separate them .",
    "more work is needed to understand the differences between these systems .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the unique structure and rich spin types of the tkls provide us a platform to realize exotic kagome - based physics .",
    "our @xmath4 and @xmath31 measurements have revealed some basic magnetic behaviors for the sixteen tkl members , which will provide a guidance for further studies .",
    "future cef excitation measurements will be important for determining the cef levels , g - tensors , and therefore to confirm the spin anisotropies for tkl members .",
    "since no lro is observed down to 50 mk in _ mgtb _ , _ zntb _ , _ mger _ , and _ znyb _ , these four tkl systems are promising candidates for hosting qsl states .",
    "other experiments , including neutron scattering , @xmath32sr , and nmr , will be helpful to identify the nature of their ground states as well as the spin correlations . since qsl states are characterized by the presence or absence of a gap in the anyon excitation spectrum",
    ", it is important to determine if any of the qsl candidate tkls possess such a gap . for nd - kls",
    ", the nature of the two - step order needs to be addressed .",
    "measurements under weak magnetic fields are needed to provide insight into this question .",
    "interpreting such measurements will be difficult , given the present polycrystalline samples , but coarse - grained behavior can be studied . for gd - tkls ,",
    "our theoretical investigation based on the luttinger - tisza method predicts a 120 @xmath33 spin structure .",
    "confirmations are needed by other direct measurements . for _ mgdy _ , neutron scattering experiments based on a powder sample with 4 - 6% site disorder have identified an eco with average spin lro ground state .",
    "we expect a similar ground state in _ zndy_. a question then would be whether or not perfect samples ( lacking any site disorder ) give rise to true lro of the dy@xmath15 spins , as predicted by the theory @xcite .",
    "for _ mgho _ , we have identified a sro state , but whether it is a true ksi state needs to be determined . for _ mger",
    "_ , it remains unclear what is the nature of the 80 mk peak in @xmath29 and whether the 2.1 k transition in is indeed a kt transition .",
    "it is also not clear what is the exact lro state for _ mgyb_. future studies are needed to answer all these questions .    on the theoretical side , due to the uniqueness of the tripod - like local ising/@xmath16 anisotropy on a kagome lattce , there are limited theoretical works at the moment that suitably describe the tkl system .",
    "our previous theoretical investigation using a luttinger - tisza type theory provides a first universal mean - field level description of the tkl @xcite . aside from this , there are few existing theoretical studies that can be directly adopted . for ising spins , moessner et al .",
    "considered classical dipoles on a 2d kagome lattice for heinsenberg spins and calculated a phase diagram by scaling dipolar and exchange interactions @xcite .",
    "this model might be a good starting point for the gd - tkls . for ising spins , models with tkl - like canted ising spins",
    "have predicted eco followed by a spin lro transition on a kagome lattice @xcite , which seems to successfully explain the experimental observation in _",
    "mgdy_. however , obvious disagreements exist for tb and ho - tkls . for @xmath16 spins ,",
    "there are even few ( if any ) theoretical studies since the situation of three distinct local @xmath16 planes has most likely not been previously considered before the realization of the tkl . therefore , the tkls offer an of unexplored realm of theory .",
    "we hope our results will stimulate more theoretical studies on these exciting tkl compounds .",
