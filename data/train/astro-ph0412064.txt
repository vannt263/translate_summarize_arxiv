    "more than 20 years ago , butcher & oemler ( 1978 ) first reported a puzzling evolution in the colours of cluster galaxies ( the `` butcher - oemler effect '' ) .",
    "their results were surprising because they showed that galaxies in clusters could not have all formed at early times of the universe and subsequently evolved passively , which was a popular theory at the time ( eggen , lynden - bell & sandage 1962 ) .",
    "the initial results have been confirmed in many subsequent studies ( e.g. , butcher & oemler 1984 [ bo84 ] ; couch & newell 1984 ; kodama & bower 2001 ; ellingson et al .",
    "2001 ; margonnier et al.2001 ) . despite the vintage of these results , there is still uncertainty over their interpretation . the result remains surprising since the cluster environment would seem hostile to star formation .",
    "cluster galaxies undergo efficient ram pressure ( gunn & gott 1972 ; abadi , moore & bower 1999 ; fujita & nagashima 1999 ; quilis , moore & bower 2000 ) , suffocation due to removal of their gaseous halos ( larson , tinsley & caldwell 1980 ; balogh , navarro & morris 2000 ; drake et al .",
    "2000 ; diaferio et al .",
    "2001 ; okamoto & nagashima 2003 ) and harassment due to the cumulative effect of fast encounters with other galaxies ( moore et al .  1996 , 1999 ) .",
    "currently , the most popular explanation is that the blue galaxies are a galaxy population that has arrived only recently in the cluster .",
    "even though their star formation may be suppressed , their previous star formation history will still be reflected in their blue colours ( kauffman 1996 ; ellingson et al .",
    "2001 ; for a recent review see bower & balogh 2004 ) .",
    "this scenario also fits well with observations of a significant population of post - starburst galaxies in clusters at @xmath6 ( dressler & gunn 1992 ; postman , lubin & oke 1998 ; dressler et al .",
    "1999 ; poggianti et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the previous discussion does not address why the population of blue cluster galaxies evolves so strongly with redshift .",
    "although the rate of infall into clusters does evolve with redshift ( bower 1991 ; kauffmann 1996 ; diaferio et al .",
    "2001 ) , on its own this effect seems insufficient to account for the rapid evolution . the additional component may come from the rapid change in the star formation rates of field galaxies over the same redshift range ( ellingson et al .",
    "it is then a matter of some debate whether the population of blue galaxies is a population of galaxies actually in the cluster itself , or whether they represent a population of infalling galaxies that have not yet reached the high density region in the cluster core .",
    "furthermore , colours do not tell the complete story . in order to investigate the nature of the `` butcher - oemler '' effect more directly",
    ", we have set out to measure the star formation rate of galaxies in the cluster core .",
    "h@xmath7 is the preferred estimator of star formation in the optical , but a large homogeneous survey covering a wide range of redshifts has not yet been completed ( see balogh & morris 2000 ; couch et al .",
    "2001 ; balogh et al .  2002",
    "; finn , zaritsky & mccarthy 2004 ; kodama et al .",
    "2004 for some recent results on distant clusters ) .",
    "the best available alternative is to use the large and homogeneous sample of clusters that form the cnoc1 survey ( e.g. , yee , ellingson & carlberg 1996 ) .",
    "although this survey lacks the wavelength coverage to measure the strength of h@xmath7 , we can investigate the evolution of star formation activity using the [ oii ] @xmath8 emission line .",
    "this dataset allows us to investigate the evolution of the equivalent width of the [ oii ] line ( ew[oii ] ) over the redshift range @xmath0 . for a datum at lower redshift",
    ", we compare these measurements with the local 2df data ( colless et al .  2001 , 2003 ) .",
    "at higher redshifts , we compare the trends seen in the cnoc1 data with publicly available catalogues of four clusters ( cl  1324 + 3011 , cl  1604 + 4304 , cl  1604 + 4321 : postman , lubin & oke 2001 ; ms  1054 - 03 : van dokkum et al .",

    "there has been a recent realization that the galaxy population is strongly bimodal ( kauffman et al .",
    "2003 ) , with distinct ` active ' star forming population and a ` passive ' population with low levels of star formation . within the active population",
    "the star formation rate seems to vary little with environment ( balogh et al .",
    "2004b ; baldry et al .",
    "2004 ) and that it is therefore more useful to characterise the galaxy population from the ratio of the active and passive populations .",

    "the extremely rapid change in @xmath76 over the redshift range out to @xmath80 reported by margonnier et al .",
    "( 2001 ) is not consistent with our study .",
    "we set out to investigate the evolution of the [ oii ] line in cluster galaxies .",
    "we found that the fraction of cluster galaxies with strong [ oii ] emission was always small and evolved little with redshift .",
    "viewed in isolation , this result is not surprising : the very dense environment in cluster cores is hostile to star formation .",
    "the commonly discussed environmental processes of ram - pressure ( gunn & gott 1972 ; abadi et al .  1999 ; fujita & nagashima 1999 ; quilis et al .",
    "2000 ) , harassment ( moore et al .  1996 , 1999 ) and strangulation ( larson et al .  1980 ; balogh et al .",
    "2000 ; drake et al .",
    "2000 ; diaferio et al .",
    "2001 ; okamoto & nagashima 2003 ) are all effective in this region .",
    "our results are showing us that this environment has always been hostile even out to @xmath50 .",
    "the very dense environment of the cluster core becomes increasingly rare as we look back to higher redshift , but star formation is always highly suppressed there .",
    "what is puzzling is to compare this result to the evolution in the colours of cluster galaxies",
    ". a long history of studies have reported an increase in the fraction of blue galaxies in cluster cores at higher redshifts ( bo84 ; kodama & bower 2001 ; ellingson et al .",
    "2001 ; margonnier et al .",
    "2001 ) . with the cnoc1 data set , we are able to compare the two measurements of galaxy star formation activity directly . within the large uncertainties ,",
    "the colours of the galaxies confirm the increase in blue fraction suggested by bo84 .",
    "first we consider two biases in the measurements that could affect this result .",
    "( 1 ) aperture effects are of course a worry in assessing these results .",
    "however , appendix a of wilman et al .",
    "( 2004 ) makes a detailed study of the likely effect on [ oii ] emission by examining the radial dependence of the colours of galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey ( hereafter sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ; stoughton et al .",
    "2002 ; abazajian et al .  2003 ) .",
    "he concludes that there is currently no evidence that the fraction of [ oii ] emitting galaxies determined from relatively small apertures ( eg .",
    ", by the 2df and sdss fiber spectrographs ) is substantially different from that determined through larger apertures .",
    "( 2 ) if the measurement error on the [ oii ] emission was large , a weak trend in the fraction of [ oii ] emitters could be masked by objects with intrinsically low star formation rates being scattered into the @xmath81}>10$]  region .",
    "however , the estimated errors in the cnoc1 equivalent widths are only 2  on average , and thus the error is too small to account for the tail seen in figure  3 as we have shown in  3 .    if we reject both of these measurement biases , how can we reconcile these apparently contradictory results ?",
    "the key may lie in the way the two measures of the galaxy activity are related to the star formation history . while the [ oii ]",
    "emission measures the radiation from short - lived hot stars , the @xmath69 colour contains a memory of the star formation rate over the previous few gyr ( eg . , van dokkum et al.2000 ) .",
    "thus one possible explanation for the result is that while most galaxies in these central cluster regions currently have little star formation at all redshifts , more galaxies in the higher redshift clusters have experienced significant star formation within the last few gyr , and have evolved from a bluer starting point . in figure  7 , we directly compare the ew[oii ] with the offset of the galaxy from the dividing colour between blue and red galaxy , which is defined at  4 ( @xmath82 . at",
    "higher redshift , there is a greater spread in colour for the range of ew[oii ] ( due both to the @xmath32-correction , and the greater star formation rates of field galaxies ) while the range in ew[oii ] is roughly similar . thus the star forming population in the lower redshift bin lie closer to the colour threshold than to the ew[oii ] threshold , while the converse is true in the high redshift panel .",
    "this provides some support for the differential evolution of ew[oii ] and colour that we have discussed .",
    "if this is a satisfactory explanation for the different evolution of @xmath49 and @xmath83 , can we understand what drives it ?",
    "two possibilities stand out : ( 1 ) the more rapid assembly of clusters at higher redshift ( bower 1991 ; kauffmann 1996 ) or ( 2 ) the star formation rates in the galaxies that are being accreted by the local clusters are lower than in their high redshift counter parts . in the first case , the mass assembly history of clusters differs between low and high redshift because clusters are much rarer objects at @xmath84 than at the present - day , and because the cosmic time available to build the cluster is less at higher redshift . in the second case ,",
    "the reduction in the star forming fraction of the infalling galaxies is clearly shown by our data on the field galaxies . as a result",
    "the galaxies which are accreted by the local clusters are much less likely to have significant star formation in the first place .",
    "it is likely that both effects contribute , and hard to disentangle them .",
    "an alternative possibility is that the [ oii ] emission is powered by agn activity rather than by star formation . in this case , the fractions would reflect very different physical processes , whose evolution might very well differ .",
    "the scenario naturally explains the existence of red galaxies with detectable [ oii ] seen in the first panel of figure  7 .",
    "martini et al .",
    "( 2004 ) show from x - ray observations that clusters may contain a significant population of agn",
    ". often these galaxies can not be recognised as agn from their optical spectra alone , yet they are clearly luminous point sources in the x - ray data .",
    "their results suggest that the active systems are over represented in clusters compared to the field .",
    "it is thus possible that an underlying trend in the star formation rates of cluster galaxies is masked by a opposing trend in the fraction undergoing agn activity .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the average agn fraction is significantly less that 5% in their data .    in future , it will also be possible to carry out this programme using other indicators of star formation and to investigate other galaxy environments .",
    "wilman et al .",
    "( 2004 ) have used [ oii ] to investigate the evolution of galaxies in groups .",
    "interestingly , they find that the fraction of star forming galaxies in the group environment increases significantly over the redshift range @xmath85 to 0.5 , suggesting that group galaxy properties are much more closely tied to galaxies in the field than galaxies in cluster cores . while the [ oii ] line is conveniently placed in the optical spectral window , it suffers the disadvantage of being sensitive to dust and metallicity as well as the star formation rate .",
    "the h@xmath7 line gives a cleaner measure of the star formation rate .",
    "for example , finn et al .  (",
    "2004 ) report measurements of h@xmath7 emission from a poor cluster ( cl  j0023 + 0423b ) at @xmath86 .",
    "although their measure of activity is not directly comparable to the one we use here , they find a much higher incidence of star formation activity than any of our clusters , or that of our h@xmath7 measurements in the rich cluster cl0024 + 1652 ( kodama et al .",
    "2004 ) . at present",
    ", however , the sample of clusters with well sampled h@xmath7 determinations is too small to make an accurate test of the rate of evolution .",
    "furthermore , it is harder to measure over a wide range of redshifts because it is redshifted out of the optical window .",
    "nevertheless , new multi - object spectrographs working in the near infrared , such as moirics , will allow us to probe the star formation rates in distant clusters with much greater accuracy using h@xmath7 emission .",
    "alternatively , it will be possible to use the spitzer satellite to measure the star formation rates in clusters on the basis of their far infra - red dust emission ( duc et al .",
    "2002 ; stanford et al .  in prep ) .",
    "the prospects look extremely good for extending the work we have described here .",
    "by compiling a homogeneous sample of the clusters with extensive spectroscopic measurements of the [ oii ] emission line , we have presented an analysis of the evolution of the fraction of strongly star forming galaxies in cluster cores as a function of redshift .",
    "our sample is based on the cnoc1 cluster survey ( yee et al .",
    "1996 ) , but extends this data set to lower and higher redshift using the 2df - grs ( colless et al .  2003 ) and spectroscopic surveys of higher redshift clusters by postman et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and van dokkum et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "our results show little evolution in the fraction of galaxies with ew[oii ] @xmath87 10 .",
    "we constrain the rate of evolution to be @xmath88 .",
    "this result suggests that the cluster environment has always been hostile to star formation , at least for @xmath6 .",
    "many mechanisms have been proposed to explain the hostility of the cluster environment at low redshift .",
    "our results show that the same mechanisms also operate effectively in this special environment at higher redshift , despite the higher rates of galaxy infall that are expected ( kaufman 1996 ) and the higher fraction of star forming galaxies in the field population .",
    "it is important to note , however , that there is extensive scatter between individual clusters at all redshifts ; thus individual clusters may pass through episodes with higher rates of field galaxy accretion .",
    "the slow evolution of @xmath49 we report , initially seems at odds with the strongly increasing fraction of blue galaxies in clusters reported in previous papers ( eg .",
    "bo84 ) ; however , we confirm that the fraction of blue galaxies increases strongly with redshift using the same galaxies for our analysis of the [ oii ] emission .",
    "we consider how the results can be reconciled . since the [ oii ] emission line is an instantaneous measure of the star formation rate , while galaxy colour reflects the average star formation rate over the previous few gyr , the two observations may be compatible if the rate at which clusters are assembled is sufficiently high at high redshift and the galaxies from which the system is assembled are initially much bluer .",
    "another possibility is that the [ oii ] emission line galaxies that we see in the low redshift systems may be powered by agn activity rather than by agn activity . a larger compilation of deep x - ray data",
    "is required to exclude this possibility .",
    "the results we present are limited by the small numbers of clusters which have been extensively surveyed at high redshift , and by the limitations of the [ oii ] emission line as a star formation rate indicator .",
    "the prospects for extending this work using h@xmath7 line strengths , spitzer mid - ir fluxes and galex ultra - violet photometry as star formation rate indicators look very encouraging .",
    "many thanks to erica ellingson and the cnoc1 collaboration , for providing us with the full cnoc1 catalogue for this analysis .",
    "we thank ian lewis for providing us with the [ oii ] measurement from 2df - grs prior to their publication . this project has made extensive use of the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , caltech .",
