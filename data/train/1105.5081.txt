    "loop quantum cosmology has provided in past years a useful framework to ask questions about the quantum nature of the early universe @xcite . closely related to loop quantum gravity @xcite ,",
    "the formalism has shown that , for isotropic models , the big bang singularity is replaced by a quantum bounce @xcite .",
    "these results have been obtained for closed and open frw cosmologies @xcite with and without a cosmological constant @xcite for a massless scalar field , and recently extended to the massive case @xcite .",
    "recently , some of these results have been extended to anisotropic @xcite and some inhomogeneous models @xcite . in all these cases , quantum gravitational effects",
    "have been shown to exert a repulsive force and halt the collapse and launch an expanding superinflationary phase before the quantum gravity effects die out and the universe then follows the standard general relativity ( gr ) dynamics .    an exactly solvable model for the @xmath0=0 frw with a massless scalar field has allowed to prove analytically the generic nature of the quantum bounce @xcite . in particular , it was shown that the bounce occurs for all physical states , and the energy density possesses a supremum for physical states @xcite . regarding the fluctuations",
    ", it has been shown that they are bounded across the bounce implying that a semiclassical state at late times after the bounce had to come from a semiclassical state before the bounce @xcite .",
    "recently , kaminski and pawlowski have imposed stronger bounds on the asymmetry in relative dispersions before and after the bounce @xcite , thus very strongly ruling out some claims of loss of semiclassicality in @xcite .",
    "these robustness result have support on the fact that , within a large possibility of ` loop quantizations ' , physical considerations select a unique consistent quantization @xcite ( the one introduced in @xcite ) .",
    "an interesting feature of this system is that one can approximate very well the dynamics followed by semiclassical states by an _",
    "effective description _",
    "@xcite . that is , the classical limit of the dynamics is not that of gr + scalar field but rather is defined by an _",
    "effective hamiltonian_. there have been several approaches to reach this result .",
    "for instance , in @xcite the author considered _ kinematical _ coherent states and used them to compute the effective hamiltonian as the expectation value of the quantum hamiltonian constraint of lqc .",
    "more recently , the authors of @xcite showed that , in the path integral description of the model , the paths that contribute the most are those that satisfy the effective equations and not those that follow the classical gr equations .    the purpose of this paper is to construct exact physical semiclassical states for the solvable model @xcite .",
    "the strategy will be to define a class of coherent initial states and , using the analytical control we have on the space of solutions to the quantum constraint equations , produce exact physical coherent states , much in the spirit of @xcite .",
    "then , we impose well motivated conditions on the behavior of the fluctuations of physical operators to select from all possible coherent states , those that exhibit a semiclassical behavior .",
    "it turns out that these conditions are sufficient to fix enough parameters of the states and to have states that are ` peaked ' on a given ( physical ) phase space point .",
    "having found semiclassical states , we explore the behavior of these states near the bounce , where one expects the state to be most quantum .",
    "in particular we consider the relative fluctuations of volume and find that , for all states and for all times , the relative fluctuations are bounded by their asymptotic value .",
    "in fact , the minimum value turns out to be precisely at the bounce . the expectation value for volume and density on semiclassical states are very well approximated by the values given by the effective theory .",
    "this leads us to conclude that the effective description is indeed a very good approximation to semiclassical _ physical _ states .",
    "a natural question is whether the class of states considered is the most general one . for that purpose",
    ", we generalize the class of gaussian states to the so called _ squeezed _ states .",
    "the idea is to explore the parameter space near the gaussian states that are well behaved semiclassical states and see whether these squeezed states exhibit better semiclassical properties .    of particular interest in this regard",
    "is the asymmetry in volume fluctuations .",
    "claims of a loss of coherence , or ` cosmic forgetfulness ' arise due to results in an approximate framework @xcite ( motivated by , but not within lqc ) that suggest that the fluctuations across the bounce might change significantly and spoil the semiclassical nature of the state @xcite .",
    "even when strong bounds against this possibility within lqc have already appeared @xcite , our _ exact _ formalism is particularly well suited for addressing this question . by imposing bounds on the total asymptotic dispersion in volume ( at late or early times with respect to the bounce )",
    ", we are able to bound how far we can be from gaussian states and still have a semiclassical state .",
    "the range on parameter space allowed turns out to depend on the physical requirements for the state , in such a way that , for ` large volume universes ' , it is severely constrained .",
    "this is turn sets very strong bounds on the allowed asymmetry in volume fluctuations , consistent with @xcite and , in particular , disproving some of the statements of @xcite that claim the loss of coherence across the bounce for semiclassical states .",

    "some of the results reported here were summarized in the short manuscript @xcite , so it is natural that there is some overlap of part of the material .",
    "in this section we shall recall the model we are considering , namely , the solvable @xmath0=0 frw model coupled to a massless scalar field",
    ". our presentation will be self - contained and slightly different from that of @xcite . in terms of the phase space variables used in loop quantum gravity ( lqg )",
    "@xcite , namely a connection @xmath1 and a densitized triad @xmath2 , the homogeneous gravitational sector can be expressed as , a_a^i = cv_0 ^ -(1/3)^o^i_a ; e^a_i = p v_0 ^ -(2/3)^oe_i^a where @xmath3 are a set of orthonormal co - triads and triads compatible with the fiducial ( flat for @xmath4 ) metric @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the volume of the fiducial cell , introduced to define the symplectic structure , with respect to @xmath5 .",
    "the phase space is characterized by conjugate variables @xmath7 satisfying @xmath8 . where @xmath9 @xmath10 is the barbero - immirzi parameter used in lqc .",
    "the triad @xmath11 is related to the physical volume @xmath12 of the fiducial cell , as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the scale factor and , on the space of classical solutions , @xmath15 .",
    "it is convenient to introduce new variables @xcite , : = c / p^1/2= p^3/2/(2 ^2 )   [ b_eq ] where @xmath16 introduced in @xcite and used thereafter . ] . here",
    "@xmath17 is the orientation of the triad with respect to that of @xmath18 .",
    "the classical constraint , with the choice @xmath19 , then becomes = 38 g ^2 ^ 2 v^2 - p_^22 0 where the matter content consists of a massless scalar field @xmath20 , with canonical momenta @xmath21 .",
    "thus , the kinematical phase space can be though of as a four dimensional space with coordinates @xmath22 .",
    "the strategy for quantization is to define an operator associated to @xmath23 and to look for states that are annihilated by the constraint operator .    in the @xmath24 representation ,",
    "the operators basic are represented as ( , ) & = & ( , ) ; ( , ) = -i4 ^ 2 ( , ) ; + _ ( , ) & = & -i ( , ) .",
    "however , the operator @xmath25 is not well defined since @xmath26 is periodic with period @xmath27 , so it has to be replaced by a well defined operator @xmath28 ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the quantum constraint of slqc becomes then @xcite , ^2 ^ 2(,)= ^2 ( ) ^2 ( , ) [ const1 ] with @xmath29 , @xmath30 . in the loop quantum cosmology literature ,",
    "the value of @xmath31 is chosen such that @xmath32 corresponds to the minimum eigenvalue of the area operator in loop quantum gravity ( corresponding to an edge of ` spin 1/2 ' ) . with this choice",
    "the free parameter @xmath31 becomes @xmath33 . by introducing x = ^-1 |(/2)| [ x - eq ]",
    "the quantum constraint can be rewritten in a klein - gordon form [ kg - eq ] _",

    "as usual for this system , in its classical evolution the scalar field @xmath20 is a monotonic function and can play the role of internal clock . in the quantum theory",
    ", one can also think of the evolution of the state with respect to @xmath20 . a general solution @xmath34 to eq .",
    "( [ kg - eq ] ) can be decomposed in the left and right moving components : [ chi_eq ] = _ + ( + x ) + _ -(- x ) : = _ + ( x_+ ) + _ -(x_- )  . the physical states that we shall consider are positive frequency solutions of ( @xmath35 ) . since there are no fermions in the model , the orientations of the triad are indistinguishable and @xmath34 satisfy the symmetry requirement @xmath36 .",
    "thus , we can write @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is an arbitrary ` positive frequency solution ' is a positive momentum function , i.e. with a fourier transform that has support on the positive axis .",

    "the expectation value of the volume @xmath59 is symmetric .",

    "the only condition that we have imposed so far is @xmath95 , which guaranties the validity of our approximation .",

    ", the answer is in the affirmative .      in order to answer this question",
    "we shall first consider the volume operator .",
    "since all physical states have the property that the expectation value of the volume operator @xmath138 at time @xmath20 follow the _ same _ functional form and , therefore , follow for large @xmath20 the same dynamics of the classical dynamics ( i.e. einstein s equations ) @xmath139 , we need more criteria to select those states that are semiclassical .",
    "the obvious strategy is to consider the state s relative dispersion @xmath140 of the volume operator at time @xmath20 .",
    "one expects that semiclassical states will have a very small relative dispersion ` at late times ' when the dynamics approaches the classical dynamics .",
    "it is then natural to consider the asymptotic relative dispersions given by _ : = _ ( ) _ ^2= w_v_^2 - 1 .",
    "it is straightforward to find the analytical expression for these quantities in our states ( in the case @xmath89 ) to be _ = w_v_^2 - 1 = e^^2/^2 ( 1 + 3 ^ 24k_0 ^ 2+^2k_0 ^ 2 ) ( 1 + ^2 + ^24k_0 ^ 2 ) ^2 -1 .",
    "[ delta - pm ] it is interesting to note that , in the previous expression , there is some competition between the factor @xmath141 and the second part . the exponential becomes close to one if @xmath83 is large compared to @xmath142 , but can become very large if @xmath83 becomes too small .",
    "on the other hand , the larger @xmath83 becomes , the larger the second term .",

    "the form of @xmath144 can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:1.1 ] .",
    "another important aspect to consider is the following .",
    "so far , we have not imposed any condition on @xmath21 .",
    "that is , we have not said that it has to be ` large ' , mainly because in the classical theory there is no dimension - full quantity with respect to which one can compare it . in the quantum theory , with the introduction of @xmath145",
    "we do have such scale . as we can see from eq.([delta - pm ] ) and the expression for @xmath146 , the quantity @xmath147 has the same dimensions of @xmath21 .",
    "furthermore , if we now impose the condition @xmath148 , all the terms in parenthesis in eq.([delta - pm ] ) are small , so we can indeed try to find the optimum value for @xmath83 .",
    "note also that the condition @xmath148 implies @xmath149 .",
    "it is in this sense that we can call the momentum @xmath21 ` large ' .",
    "the condition that the expression ( [ delta - pm ] ) be an extrema is a cubical equation , and the only physically interesting solution can be approximated as , ^2 2 k_0 + 27 ^2 .since we require that @xmath148 , then the second term is very small compared to the first one and we can approximate @xmath150 .",
    "it is important to stress that this condition selects a preferred value for @xmath83 for which the state is most semiclassical .",
    "as can be seen from the figure  [ fig:1.1 ] , if we make @xmath83 slightly smaller ( in an attempt to ` make the dispersion small ' ) the asymptotic relative dispersion in volume becomes very large , making the state not a good candidate for a semiclassical state .",

    "the @xmath83 dependence of the asymptotic relative dispersion of the volume can be seen in figure  [ fig:1.1 ] , with @xmath152 .",
    "two features characterize this plot , namely , the first one is that for @xmath153 the function is exponential so it grows very quickly as one approaches zero ; the second feature is that for @xmath154 the function has a polynomial behavior , so one can have values of @xmath155 without @xmath144 changing too much .",

    ", one has to choose the parameter @xmath83 carefully as a function of the other relevant parameter ( in this case , the parameter @xmath82 ) .",
    "that is , if we choose @xmath83 to be of the order of @xmath159 , we can then minimize the asymptotic relative dispersion of volume after and before the bounce ( which are the same , as we have seen ) .",
    "gaussian states for which this condition is not satisfied will have , in general , large quantum fluctuations in the regime where we expect them to be small for large times after and before the bounce so they can not be regarded as semiclassical .",

    "the question we want to ask now is the following : can we reproduce some of the features that are characteristic of the so called `` effective dynamics '' ? as we have discussed before , the ` classical ' hamiltonian constraint one obtains from replacing classical quantities like connection and curvature by a corresponding holonomy functions with a finite parameter @xmath31 , can be seen as either a starting point for ` polymer quantization ' , or as the ` classical limit ' of a loop quantized theory . in any case",
    ", we expect that the semiclassical states of the quantum theory approach this ` classical theory ' in the appropriate regime .",
    "in other words , we want to know when the effective dynamics is a good approximation to the full quantum dynamics .",
    "is there a choice of parameters in the gaussian states for which the effective dynamics is not a good approximation ?",
    "we shall answer these questions in the remainder of this section .",
    "another important issue is the question of how semiclassical the state is at the bounce .",
    "for instance , if the state has a very small relative asymptotic dispersion @xmath144 at late times , one might want to know what the relative dispersion is at the bounce and how it compares to @xmath144 .",

    "[ fig:1.2 ] , where it is shown that the relative fluctuation is bounded , it attains its minimum value at the bounce and approaches @xmath144 asymptotically .",
    "thus , somewhat surprisingly , the state does not become very  quantum - like \" at the planck scale but rather preserves its coherence across the bounce .",
    "let us now try to estimate the value of the relative dispersion in comparison to its asymptotic value .",

    "note that the minimum of this quantity is at the bounce ( here corresponding to @xmath76 ) .",
    "it is found that the value at the bounce is approximately 1/2 of its asymptotic value for the generalized gaussian states . ]    now , if we impose @xmath163 , which is satisfied if we choose @xmath164 , then the last equation has the form , .",
    "( v)^2v ^2 |_-12 .",
    "( v)^2v ^2 | _ & = & o(^2/^2 ) + o(^2/k_0 ^ 2 ) .",

    "( v)^2v ^2 |_= _ .",
    "this approximation , for instance , has an error of @xmath166 when @xmath152 , and it becomes smaller as @xmath82 grows . if we use the eqs .   and and choose the value of @xmath83 that minimized the relative fluctuation we get @xmath167 this approximation have an error of @xmath168 when @xmath152 , and becomes smaller as we increase @xmath82 .",
    "we have performed intensive numerical explorations and have seen that , for @xmath111 , the relative fluctuation is again smaller at the bounce and approaches @xmath169 of its asymptotic value .",
    "thus , we can conclude that states that satisfy the conditions @xmath165 , imposed by our requirements on the asymptotic relative dispersion of the volume through the choice @xmath170 , exhibit also semiclassical behavior at the bounce , in the sense that the relative dispersion in volume is bounded and small .",
    "even more , the relative fluctuation at the bounce is approximately @xmath169 of the asymptotic value .",
    "these analytical results give support to the numerical explorations reported in @xcite .",
    "having shown that a semiclassical quantum state behaves also semiclassically at the bounce , it is then natural to ask whether the state yields observables through their expectation values that follow some classical trajectories .",
    "it turns out that it does , but the ` classical theory ' it approaches is not the standard classical theory ( gr+ massless scalar field ) , but rather an _ effective theory _ , as defined by an effective hamiltonian constraint @xmath171 @xcite , which contains the _ quantum geometry scale _ @xmath172 .",
    "the effective dynamics , is generated by the effective hamiltonian constraint @xmath173 and has several important features .",
    "the first one is that all trajectories have a bounce that occurs at the same critical density @xmath174 .",
    "the volume reaches a minimum value at the bounce that depends on the observable @xmath21 : v_min = p _ . in the quantum theory ,",
    "we have seen that every physical states has a bounce where the minimum volume is given by @xmath175 .",
    "it is then natural to find the corresponding volume at the bounce for our family of gaussian states .",

    ", we can compare the last two equations to see that @xmath180 . using the value @xmath181",
    ", we conclude that v_bounce v_min , which is what we wanted to show .",
    "note that the higher the value of @xmath82 , the better the approximation becomes .",
    "in other words , if @xmath82 were not large enough ( compared to @xmath142 ) , not only would the asymptotic relative fluctuation of volume be large , but the effective equations would fail to be a good approximation to the quantum dynamics .",
    "this seems to indicate that quantum gaussian states with a higher value of @xmath82 behave more classically , in contradiction with the classical intuition that tells us that ` rescaling of @xmath82 ' is physically irrelevant=0 frw model has a rescaling symmetry of the equations of motion , and of the underlying spacetime metric given by @xmath182 for @xmath183 a constant .",
    "this can be understood as coming from the freedom of choosing arbitrary fiducial cells for the formulation of the theory @xcite . ] .",
    "thus , we have to conclude that this rescaling symmetry of the classical theory is broken in the quantum theory .",
    "note however , that even when the exact symmetry is broken , one might expect to regain it in the limit of large @xmath82 which , as we have seen , corresponds to @xmath184 . for an in - depth discussion regarding this scaling freedom see @xcite .",
    "another important result for this solvable model is that the energy density @xmath185 is absolutely bounded by the critical density @xmath186 @xcite .",
    "it is then natural to ask what the behavior of the energy density at the bounce is , for semiclassical states .",
    "one might imagine that , for instance , the more semiclassical the state , the higher the density at the bounce .",
    "in this part we shall explore this question by taking several quantities to measure density .",
    "for instance , the simplest one would be @xmath187 , a quantity shown to be bounded by @xmath186 @xcite .",

    "one can also see that , if we were to fix @xmath82 and leave @xmath83 free , the density grows and approaches @xmath186 as @xmath83 grows .",
    "thus , asking for the density to approach the critical density is not a very stringent condition on @xmath83 as the relative fluctuations in volume was .",
    "note also that , if @xmath82 was small enough to be of the order of @xmath142 , the density at the bounce would be far from the critical density giving yet another indication that those states are not semiclassical .",
    "the other quantities representing density that one can build , by taking for instance @xmath191 and @xmath192 , give expressions that have the same qualitative behavior , approaching @xmath186 as @xmath82 grows .       of @xmath20 for which one reaches the classical region are plotted as a function of @xmath82 , where @xmath90=0 , @xmath193 and @xmath158 at @xmath76 . in the plot , @xmath194 dotted , @xmath195 dashed , @xmath196 dotdashed , @xmath197 down line , @xmath198 middle line , and @xmath199 the top line .",

    "one way of measuring this could be in terms of the variable @xmath26 ( when @xmath202 ) , or in terms of the energy density ( @xmath203 ) .",
    "however if one wants to ask a similar question in the quantum realm , one immediately faces the following dilemma .",
    "as we have seen in the previous part , a gaussian state remains semiclassical across and after the bounce .",
    "in fact , the closer to the bounce , the more semiclassical it is .",
    "we can not therefore ask when does the state become semiclassical , based on the behavior of fluctuations of the relevant operators .",
    "still , we would like to have the notion of a transition from a quantum gravity dominated regime to a the regime where the quantum gravity effects are small and one is in the  classical regime \" .",
    "for this purpose , we want to propose such a criteria , and define the ( percentual ) error between the relative fluctuation and the asymptotic relative fluctuation , ( ) : = .(v)^2v ^2|_-_+ _ + 100 .",
    "we expect that this error will be small when we are approaching the classical region .",
    "let us now motivate this proposal .",
    "while we can not define a transition in terms of a change in the relative fluctuations of the basic operators , we could compare them to those of the standard ` wheeler dewitt ' model .",
    "for we know that the expectation values in the wdw theory follow closely the classical dynamics of general relativity .",
    "there is indeed a canonical way of mapping a lqc state to a wdw state , so the comparison of expectation values is well defined @xcite .",
    "we have done that for our gaussian states and computed the corresponding relative fluctuation for the volume .",
    "it turns out that , for the wdw dynamics , the relative fluctuation is _ constant _ in @xmath20 evolution , and corresponds precisely to the asymptotic relative dispersion of lqc .",
    "thus , the lqc evolution not only approximates the wdw one in terms of expectation values but also in terms of the relative fluctuations .",
    "it is then justified to measure the transition to the ` classical regime ' in terms of how close the lqc evolution is to the corresponding wdw dynamics .    in order to study where the classical region begins , we found the value of @xmath20 for which @xmath204 with @xmath205 , taking @xmath76 at the bounce .",
    "the values @xmath206 of @xmath20 that satisfy these conditions are plotted in figure [ fig:1.3 ] .",

    "these results are similar if @xmath213 .",
    "furthermore , if we choose @xmath214 , the only change is in the value of @xmath20 at the bounce .",
    "if we change the value of @xmath83 for a fixed @xmath82 , then for larger ( than @xmath215 ) values , the time @xmath216 of arrival to the classical region is smaller .",
    "in that case , the value of the density is closer to the critical one , and in the limit of large @xmath83 the classical region is ` at the bounce ' , which does not make much sense . in this way",
    "the need to bound @xmath83 to be near the value @xmath215 is manifested .",
    "the relation given by eq .",
    "( [ dens - delta ] ) is telling us the order of the quantum corrections .",
    "thus , if we say that the quantum corrections are negligible when , say , @xmath217 then the density will be of the order @xmath218 . recall that gaussian states are symmetric about the bounce , namely @xmath219 , therefore all the conclusions of this part equally apply before the bounce .",
    "let us now summarize this section .",
    "we have seen that appropriate physical conditions imposed on the behavior of basic physical observables are enough to constraint the parameters that characterize the generalized gaussian states ( [ coh_state ] ) , and obtain truly semiclassical states .",
    "of the three continuous parameters @xmath220 that characterize the states , two of them are fixed by semiclassicality considerations , while the choice of @xmath11 represents a true choice of _ initial condition_. we have seen that asking that the relative fluctuations of the observable @xmath114 be small imposes that @xmath95 .",
    "smallness of the asymptotic relative fluctuation of the volume implies then that @xmath221 .",
    "if these conditions are satisfied , we saw that the semiclassical states at ` late times ' remain semiclassical across the bounce and that the volume and density at the bounce are very well approximated by the effective theory .",
    "we have also seen that the scaling symmetry of the classical theory is not present , within the class of states under consideration , when @xmath82 is of the order of @xmath142 . however , in the limit of large @xmath82 , all the properties of the state remain invariant in terms of being well approximated by the classical effective theory. this leads us to conclude that the scaling symmetry is approximately recovered for  large @xmath21 \" ( for details regarding this issue , see @xcite ) .",
    "still , the gaussian states we have considered are not the most general states one can consider . in the following section we shall explore the",
    "so called _ squeezed states _ , a generalization of the gaussian states and compare their semiclassicality properties to those of the gaussian states .",

    "the other quantities are given by the expression , w_&=&_3_-^k^2 k , + & = & 2_3e , with @xmath239 and @xmath240 .",
    "this integral can be performed for @xmath89 and we get w_=_3 , where @xmath241 .",
    "it is now straightforward to find @xmath144 , the asymptotic relative dispersion for volume , _ & = & a^24 ^2 - 1 , .",
    "let us now explore those conditions that select semiclassical states .",
    "in this part , we want to see how the semiclassicality conditions are satisfied if we move along the ` squeezing parameter ' @xmath242 , off the gaussian semiclassical states , corresponding to @xmath237 . instead of performing an exhaustive analysis of this question ,",
    "as we have done in previous sections for gaussian states , we have computed the relevant quantities and plotted them .    .",
    "in the plot @xmath243 , @xmath244 , @xmath245 , @xmath246 and @xmath89 .",
    "the maximal value of the density correspond to the gaussian states .",
    "is clear that the squeezed states have a maximal density close to @xmath186 only if the state is near to the gaussian states . ]",
    "0.4 cm recall that for gaussian states , asking that the asymptotic relative dispersion in volume be a minimum , selected an optimal ` width ' @xmath247 for the gaussian .",
    "this value had also the property that the density at the bounce was very close to the critical density @xmath248 . in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] we have plotted the asymptotic relative dispersion and density at the bounce as functions of @xmath83 and @xmath242 .",
    "the @xmath237 slice corresponds then to the values found for gaussian states .",
    "it can not be appreciated in the figure but , for a fixed @xmath83 , the asymptotic relative dispersion @xmath144 , as a function of @xmath242 does not attain its minimum at zero , but rather at some value @xmath249 for @xmath250 ( and @xmath251 for @xmath252 ) .",
    "thus , if one chooses , for the parameter of the squeezed state the value @xmath253 , one is ` improving ' the asymptotic relative dispersion after the bounce , and , at the same time , increasing the value of the asymptotic dispersion _ before _ the bounce . in this process ,",
    "one is introducing an asymmetry in the fluctuations .",
    "this fact has been used to suggest the possibility , for example , that the asymmetry could be so large to spoil the semiclassicality properties across the bounce . as we shall see below",
    ", this possibility is however , not realized .",
    "what one can indeed see from the figure is that , as we move further away from the gaussian states , that is , as we increase to values @xmath254 , the asymptotic relative dispersion increases steeply , for both signs of @xmath242 .",
    "as can be seen from the figure , the density at the bounce ( in blue ) decreases as we go away from @xmath237 in both directions , reaching densities much less than the critical value very fast .     , @xmath255 , @xmath245 , @xmath246 and @xmath89 .",
    "the global minimum is over the gaussian states and has an exponential behavior if we move far away from the gaussian state or if @xmath156 is smaller that @xmath256 . ]",
    "both phenomena suggest that we can indeed consider squeezed states as semiclassical states _",
    "provided we remain very close to the gaussian states_. the question is then how close we can be in order to still have semiclassical behavior as exhibited by the gaussian states . for this purpose ,",
    "we have plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] the volume at the bounce as function of @xmath83 and @xmath242 .",
    "we again see that , as was the case for the density at the bounce , the volume at the bounce has indeed a minimum at the gaussian states , namely , for @xmath237 . using both relative volume and density at the bounce",
    ", we can then define an interval , as function of @xmath83 , in which the parameter @xmath242 can take values and the state still be considered as semiclassical . more precisely , we define some tolerance for the asymptotic relative dispersion @xmath257 , and find the maximum value of @xmath258 for which the relative dispersion is below the value @xmath259 .",
    "we then find the value of the density at the bounce for the value @xmath258 .",
    "we have made extensive explorations for different values of @xmath259 and @xmath82 , and have found that , for a fixed value of @xmath259 , the larger the value of @xmath82 , the smaller the allowed interval in @xmath242 .",
    "for example , for @xmath260 , the dependence of @xmath258 on @xmath82 can be approximated ( for large @xmath82 , @xmath170 , @xmath89 and @xmath158 ) as @xmath261 .",
    "the value of @xmath262 at that point is equal to @xmath263 .",
    "( for @xmath264 , @xmath265 and @xmath266 . )    . in the plot @xmath267 , @xmath268 , @xmath245 , @xmath246 and @xmath89 . outside of the vertical one",

    "one line mark the gaussian states ( @xmath269 ) that is just when the curve is zero and the other line is for states with @xmath256 . ]",
    "let us now return to the issue of the asymmetry across the bounce of the relative dispersion in volume .",
    "as we have mentioned , without any control on the value of the parameters , one could in principle have a large asymmetry that translates into a loss of semiclassicality across the bounce .",
    "this scenario was suggested in @xcite , but where the analysis was made for an effective formalism not directly derived from lqc and with little control on the semiclassicality conditions .",
    "here we are better equipped to make precise statements about this asymmetry based on the control we have on analytical expressions and the possible values the parameters of the states can have . in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] we have plotted the relative difference @xmath270 in asymptotic relative dispersion , as a function of @xmath83 and @xmath242 .",
    "we have included , as vertical surfaces , the boundary of the allowed region in parameter space .",
    "two slices in the figure are worth mentioning .",
    "the curve @xmath237 , which is viewed almost vertical in the figure corresponds to the gaussian states . on that curve , @xmath219 so the relative difference vanishes .",
    "the second highlighted curve corresponds to the choice @xmath271 , which is the extension to @xmath272 of the optimal gaussian states .",
    "note that this curve starts at zero , increases ( for positive @xmath242 ) , reaches a maximum and then decreases tending to zero .",
    "the curve is antisymmetric with respect to @xmath242 .",
    "thus , there are two points for which @xmath273 reaches a maximum .",
    "what we have seen , by taking many different values of @xmath82 , is that this maximum value is indeed , extremely small .",
    "for instance , for @xmath274 , the maximum is about @xmath275 .",
    "as we increase @xmath82 this value decreases even further .",
    "these results show that indeed , semiclassical states are very symmetric and that semiclassicality is preserved across the bounce .",
    "one should also note that this quantitative analysis invalidates the claims of @xcite , and @xcite regarding the allowed asymmetry in fluctuations across the bounce and ` cosmic forgetfulness ' , and supports the results of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "for instance , in the first reference of @xcite , it is claimed that the relative change in relative asymptotic dispersion in volume can be as large as 20 for semiclassical states , while we have demonstrated that this quantity is several orders of magnitude smaller for realistic values of the parameter @xmath82 ( of the order of @xmath275 for @xmath274 , and much smaller for the values expected to represent realistic universes ( @xmath276 or larger ) ) .",
    "let us summarize our results .",
    "we have defined coherent gaussian states as candidates for semiclassical states ` peaked ' around points of the classical ( physical ) phase space .",
    "we have imposed consistency conditions on such states by asking that the relative dispersion of the volume be small at late times after the bounce .",
    "this condition implies that one of the parameters , yielding the momentum of the scalar field , be large and fixes one of the other parameters .",
    "we can therefore find a canonical gaussian state for a given point of the classical phase space corresponding to a classical solution at late times .",
    "when exploring the properties of these states near the quantum bounce we found that they behave also semiclassically in the deep quantum region ; the relative fluctuations of volume are of the same order and smaller than in the asymptotic , large volume , region .",
    "furthermore , for those states that have small fluctuations , the expectation value of the volume and energy density at the bounce are very well approximated by the so called effective theory , thus giving support to the claim that this theory is a good approximation to the quantum dynamics , even in the deep planck regime .",
    "next , we introduced squeezed states , a one parameter generalization of gaussian states and studied their properties in a vicinity of the semiclassical gaussian states . as we showed , the range of this extra parameter is severely restricted if we want to maintain a small relative fluctuation for the volume .",
    "furthermore , if one departs from the gaussian states too much , both the volume and density at the bounce differ very rapidly from the value on the gaussian states ( and also the ` effective theory ' ) .",
    "thus , we are lead to conclude that the gaussian states exhibit a better semiclassical behavior than squeezed states .",
    "an important issue that can be studied quantitatively in this solvable model is that of the asymmetry on the volume fluctuations .",
    "on gaussian states the fluctuations are the same before and after the bounce . as one introduces the squeezing parameter , the fluctuations are no longer symmetric .",
    "in fact , depending on the choice of sign of the parameter , either one of the fluctuations becomes smaller and reaches an absolute minimum in the vicinity of the gaussian states .",
    "at the same time , the relative fluctuation on the opposite side of the bounce increases .",
    "the question is then how big can this asymmetry be ?",
    "what we saw is that for a given , somewhat arbitrary choice of parameters , that is still far from those giving rise to a realistic ` large ' universe , the relative difference in relative dispersion is very small ( of the order of @xmath275 ) , and decreases for more realistic values of the parameters .",
    "thus , even if we were to choose the squeezing parameter such that this asymmetry is maximized , the relative change is so small that , for all practical purposes , the state is symmetric . a state that is semiclassical on one side of the bounce not only remains semiclassical on the other side , but maintains its coherence .",
    "this quantitative analysis therefore invalidates claims of ` loss of coherence ' across the bounce @xcite , where it was claimed that the relative change in ( relative ) dispersion can be several orders of magnitude larger .",
    "one particular feature of the classical description of the system under consideration is that it possesses a rescaling symmetry . in the spacetime description , we can rescale the volume by a constant and the physical properties of the spacetime remain invariant . in the phase space description",
    "this is manifested by a symmetry in the equations of motion . this symmetry ,",
    "however , can not be treated as _ gauge _ , in the same sense that hamiltonian symmetries are .",
    "one can understand the origin of this symmetry by recalling that the @xmath0=0 model needs a fiducial volume for its hamiltonian description , and this choice is completely arbitrary . in turn , this means that there is no scale with respect to which one could compare the momentum @xmath21 of the scalar field ; there is no meaning to the statement that ` @xmath21 is large ' .",
    "as we have seen , in the quantum theory planck constant introduces such a scale and this is manifested in the behavior of certain quantum observables .",
    "one of the semiclassicality conditions we have found is that the larger the expectation value of @xmath277 , the more semiclassical the state is .",
    "what we have also seen is that the rescaling symmetry is only approximately recovered , for our class of states , in the ` very large @xmath278 limit ' , which can be taken as the _ classical limit _ of the system . for further details on this issue ,",

    "<S> the spatially flat friedman - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmological model with a massless scalar field in loop quantum cosmology admits a description in terms of a completely solvable model . this has been used to prove that : i ) the quantum bounce that replaces the big bang singularity is generic ; ii ) there is an upper bound on the energy density for all states and iii ) semiclassical states at late times had to be semiclassical before the bounce . </S>",
    "<S> here we consider a family of exact solutions to the theory , corresponding to generalized coherent gaussian and squeezed states . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the behavior of basic physical observables and impose restrictions on the states based on physical considerations . </S>",
    "<S> these turn out to be enough to select , from all the generalized coherent states , those that behave semiclassical at late times . </S>",
    "<S> we study then the properties of such states near the bounce where the most ` quantum behavior ' is expected . as it turns out , </S>",
    "<S> the states remain sharply peaked and semiclassical _ at the bounce _ and the dynamics is very well approximated by the ` effective theory ' throughout the time evolution . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the semiclassicality properties of squeezed states to those of the gaussian semiclassical states and conclude that the gaussians are better behaved . in particular , the asymmetry in the relative fluctuations before and after the bounce are negligible , thus ruling out claims of so called ` cosmic forgetfulness ' . </S>"
