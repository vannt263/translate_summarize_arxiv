    "numerous studies have been made to study two dimensional quantum systems of electrons in a magnetic field , including the hofstadter energy spectrum [ 1 ] and the quantum hall effects [ 2 ] .",
    "hofstadter studied the energy spectrum for non - interacting electrons on a two dimensional square lattice in a perpendicular uniform magnetic field , namely the energy spectrum vs. magnetic flux per plaquette known as the hofstadter butterfly .",
    "the energy spectrum was found to critically depend on the ratio @xmath0 ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 are positive integers ) of the magnetic flux per plaquette to the flux quantum . if @xmath0 is a rational number , each energy band is split into @xmath2 sub - bands by the magnetic field .",
    "the hofstadter butterfly displays a recursive structure over rational ( number ) fields and a cantor set at any irrational number of @xmath0 [ 1 ] .",
    "the gap structure predicted by the hofstadter butterfly is known to play an important role on the magnetoresistance of the laterally modulated two - dimensional electron systems in gaas - algaas heterostructure [ 3 ] .",
    "such gap structure can be sensitive to the strength of interactions between electrons . lately , based on the hartree approximation gudmundsson and gerhardts [ 4 ] studied the effects of interacting electrons on the hofstadter butterfly . in the present study we derive a new harper s equation which will allow us to study the hofstadter energy spectrum as a function of coulomb repulsion by properly taking into account electron interactions . as an illustration we pay a special attention to the interesting system of antiferromagnetically correlated electrons on a square lattice .",
    "earlier hasegawa et al.[5 ] studied the harper s equation [ 6 ] and the energy spectrum only for spinless non - interacting electrons . in the present study",
    "we derive a new harper s equation in order to study the hofstadter butterfly , that is , the energy spectrum vs. magnetic flux as a function of interaction strength ( coulomb repulsion @xmath3 ) between electrons .    in order to treat interacting electrons in a two dimensional square lattice in a perpendicular uniform magnetic field , we consider the one - band hubbard model hamiltonian , h=- + u - , [ flux_mean ] with t_ij = -t(-i_j^i d ) . here",

    "using ( 14 ) and ( 15 ) above , we readily find @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42 here represents the energy spectrum of non - interacting electrons .",
    "the energy dispersion relation @xcite for the system of interacting electrons is readily obtained from ( 16 ) above , ( ) = ( 1-)- , [ hofs_corr ] with the energy gap , @xmath43 .",
    "here we reintroduced the first term which was omitted in ( 5 ) .",
    "as seen in ( [ hofs_corr ] ) above , the energy spectrum @xmath44 shows the variation of energy gap with both the staggered magnetization @xmath45 and the coulomb interaction @xmath3 .",
    "however the dispersion relation ( 17 ) indicates that the self - similarity and homeomorphism to the cantor set are not affected by such electron correlations .    now using in ( 16 ) the translation matrix q(;k_y)_j=1^qa_j(;k_y ) , [ matq ] made of @xmath2 successive products of @xmath46 we obtain g(q+1 ) + g(q)= q(;k_ya)g(1 ) + g(0 ) where @xmath47 or @xmath48 .",
    "note that in the expression ( [ matq ] ) , @xmath42 is replaced by @xmath44 due to relation ( [ hofs_corr ] ) .",
    "further we note from the bloch theorem , g(q+1 ) + g(q)= e^iqk_xa",
    "g(1 ) + g(0 ) .",
    "thus we readily find from ( 19 ) and ( 20 ) , @xmath49 one of the eigenvalues of @xmath50 is complex conjugate to the other in order to have a real value of @xmath51 .",
    "thus we have q(;k_y ) = 2(qk_xa ) . [ trqen ]",
    "the @xmath52 dependency of the trace is additively separable as shown by buther and brown [ 9 ] , and thus we write q()q ( ; ) = 2(qk_xa ) + 2(qk_ya ) .",
    "since @xmath53 is simply the @xmath2-th polynomial of @xmath44 , there exist @xmath2 sub - bands for a given @xmath30 . here",
    "@xmath30 is readily obtained for given @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath44 should satisfy the following condition , |q()|4 .",
    "[ tr_cond ] one can determine from the condition ( 23 ) whether a state of a given energy @xmath44 is possible or not .",
    "using the relations ( 22 ) and ( 23 ) above , we compute the hofstadter energy spectrum as a function of @xmath54 for the square lattice of antiferromagnetically correlated electrons at half - filling , that is , @xmath55 . in principle , the self consistent equations for @xmath45 and @xmath56 can be derived for a lattice of infinite size [ 8 ] . for the case of finite size lattices",
    "we obtain @xmath45 and @xmath56 numerically for arbitrary values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "it is important to thoroughly check numerical precision of the computed staggered magnetization @xmath45 in order to accurately evaluate dispersion relation ( 17 ) .",
    "this is because @xmath45 in the dispersion relation is very sensitive to the variation of @xmath0 . in order to check numerical accuracy , in fig .  1 we show the computed results of staggered magnetization @xmath45 as a function of coulomb repulsion @xmath3 for the two cases of finite ( @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 square lattices ) and infinite size lattices .",
    "for both zero magnetic field and the non - zero magnetic field ( corresponding to half a flux quantum per plaquette ) , the computed results of @xmath45 with the finite size lattices ( denoted as solid or open circles in fig .  1 )",
    "are nearly the same as the exact values obtained from the use of the infinite size lattice ( denoted as a solid line in fig .  1 ) .",
    "encouraged by such numerical accuracy , we computed the hofstadter energy spectra of interacting electrons for various values of @xmath3 by using the finite size lattice of @xmath60 .",
    "they are shown in fig .  2 through 4 .",
    "we find that the structure of the hofstadter energy spectrum for interacting electrons is greatly modified only in the band gaps and the band widths ( the bars in the figures stand for the band width ) which depend on the strength of the coulomb interaction @xmath3 , as well displayed in figs .  2 through 4 .",
    "indeed this is clearly understood from the expression of the energy dispersion relation ( 17 ) .",
    "although not shown here , at higher values of @xmath3 we find no other changes but larger band gaps and narrower band widths in the hofstadter energy spectrum .",
    "the self - similarity of the hofstadter butterfly is preserved at all values of coulomb interaction @xmath3 .",
    "the band gap in the structure of the hofstadter spectrum is predicted to be undulatory particularly at the low value of @xmath61 as shown in fig .",
    "3 . for the sake fo clarity ,",
    "undulatory feature of the band gap as a function of magnetic flux is explicitly shown in fig .",
    "it is noted that this undulatory behavior seen at a low value of @xmath62 originates from the oscillatory variation of the staggered magnetization @xmath45 as a function of @xmath0 . at larger values of @xmath3",
    "such oscillatory behavior disappears as seen in fig .",
    "this is because the staggered magnetization ( or antiferromagnetic order ) becomes increasingly stable and thus insensitive to the variation of magnetic field .",
    "the hofstadter spectrum yields an additional sub - band only for odd @xmath2 .",
    "this is caused by the coulomb interaction which splits the band containing the fermi level into two bands .",
    "in short , one can readily see from the dispersion relation ( 17 ) that only the band gaps and the band widths in the hofstadter spectrum but not the essential characters of the self - similarity and the cantor set can be affected by interactions between electrons .",
    "in the present study we derived a new generalized harper s equation to deal with both the undoped ( half - filling , @xmath63 ) and doped ( @xmath64 ) systems by allowing interactions between electrons , and examined the hofstadter energy spectrum as a function of coulomb repulsion @xmath3 for the square lattice of correlated electrons at half - filling .",
    "we found that such coulomb interactions between electrons affect only the band gaps and band widths in the structure of the hofstadter butterfly .",
    "judging from the dispersion relation ( 17 ) , the inclusion of electron correlation effects beyond the mean field level will modify only the band gaps and band widths in the hofstadter spectrum , but not the self - similarity of the hofstadter spectrum and the homeomorphism to the cantor set .",
