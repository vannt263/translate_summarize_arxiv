    "quantum chromodynamics at low energy remains enigmatic chiefly because of an almost complete lack of knowledge of the properties of soft glue .",
    "glue must certainly be understood if phenomena such as color confinement , mass generation , and dynamical symmetry breaking are to be understood .",
    "the discovery and explication of hadrons with excited gluonic degrees of freedom is clearly an important step in this process .",
    "furthermore , the search for nonperturbative glue , in particular as manifested in hybrid mesons , would be greatly facilitated by a rudimentary knowledge of the hybrid spectrum and decay characteristics .",
    "although it appears that lattice estimates of light quenched hybrid masses are forthcoming@xcite , hadronic decays remain difficult to calculate on the lattice .",
    "thus one is forced to rely on model estimates of the couplings of hybrids to ordinary mesons .",
    "historically , there have been two approaches to such estimates .",
    "the first assumes that hybrids are predominantly quark - antiquark states with an additional constituent gluon@xcite and that decays proceed via constituent gluon dissociation@xcite .",
    "the second assumes that hybrids are quark - antiquark states moving on an adiabatic surface generated by an excited  flux tube \" configuration of glue@xcite .",
    "decays then proceed by a phenomenological pair production mechanism ( the  @xmath3 model \" ) coupled with a flux tube overlap@xcite .",
    "an important feature of this model is that the quark pair creation vertex is uncorrelated with the gluonic modes of the hybrid .",
    "a third possibility for hybrid decay has been recently introduced @xcite .",
    "this model also assumes flux tube hybrids but employs a different decay vertex .",
    "the vertex is constructed by using the heavy quark expansion of the coulomb gauge qcd hamiltonian to identify relevant operators .",
    "the gluonic portion of these are then evaluated using a slightly extended version of the flux tube model of isgur and paton@xcite .",
    "the essential new feature is that the gluon field operator is expressed in terms of the nonperturbative phonon modes of the flux tube model rather than traditional plane waves .",
    "this paper begins with a review of the development of the decay model of ref .",
    "@xcite and describes in detail several issues which arise in converting the amplitudes to decay widths .",
    "we then summarize the main general features of the model and compare these with the flux tube decay model of isgur , kokoski , and paton ( hereafter referred to as ikp ) .",
    "the main portion of this work is a comprehensive review of the decay modes of all low lying isovector , isoscalar , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath2 @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 hybrids .",
    "a detailed discussion of interesting features in the phenomenology of these states follows .",
    "the first step in the construction of any hybrid decay model is determining what is meant by a hybrid .",
    "we stress that choosing a model of hybrids with the correct degrees of freedom is crucial because decays probe the internal structure of the participating particles .",
    "thus for example , in the flux tube model low lying vector hybrids must have the quarks in a spin singlet and this implies that vector hybrids may not decay to a pair of spin zero mesons ( see below for further discussion of this point ) .",
    "however , this need not be true in a model which assigns hybrid quantum numbers differently ( for example , it is possible to construct spin one vector hybrids in constituent glue models ) . in this work ,",
    "we choose to employ a slightly modified version of the flux tube model hybrids of isgur and paton , as described in refs .",
    "recent lattice calculations of adiabatic hybrid potential surfaces show that the flux tube model does a good job of describing the level orderings and degeneracies apparent in the data ( although it does not reproduce many details)@xcite .",
    "thus one may be confident that the model captures the essential features of ( heavy ) hybrid structure necessary for the construction of a viable decay model .    the flux tube model of isgur and paton @xcite",
    "is extracted from the strong coupling limit of the qcd lattice hamiltonian .",
    "the hamiltonian is first split into blocks of distinct  topologies \" ( in reference to possible gauge invariant flux tube configurations ) and then adiabatic and small oscillation approximations of the flux tube dynamics are made to arrive at an n - body discrete string - like model hamiltonian for gluonic degrees of freedom .",
    "this is meant to be operative at intermediate scales @xmath10 where the strong coupling is of order unity .",
    "the lattice spacing is denoted by @xmath11 , the string tension by @xmath12 , and there are @xmath13 `` beads '' ( or links ) evenly spaced between the @xmath14 pair . diagonalizing the flux tube hamiltonian yields phonons , @xmath15 , which are labelled by their color ( @xmath11 ) , mode number ( @xmath16 ) , and polarization ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "a hybrid may be built of @xmath18 phonons in the mth mode with polarization @xmath19 .",
    "in particular , hybrid states with a single phonon excitation are constructed as    @xmath20    spin and flavor indices have been suppressed and color indices are explicit .",
    "the factor @xmath21 in the hybrid wavefunction projects onto states of good parity and charge conjugation .",
    "the quantum numbers of these states are given by @xmath22 and @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "these expressions differ from isgur and paton@xcite because we have adopted the standard definitions for the polarization vectors and the wigner rotation matrix , following the jacob - wick conventions .",
    "we shall consider low - lying hybrids only so that @xmath26 in what follows .",
    "it remains to specify the structure of the decay operator .",
    "to leading order in the hopping parameter and strong coupling expansion , one can show that the operator for producing a @xmath27 pair has the following structure @xcite ,    @xmath28    the dependence on the relative distance , @xmath29 , comes from integrating @xmath30 products of the link operators from the kinetic term @xmath31 over a straight line in direction of @xmath32 .",
    "the prefactor @xmath33 can be identified with the schwinger tunneling factor for pair production in an external field of the parent @xmath34 meson . in our picture , hybrids are characterized by excitations of the gluonic field .",
    "we will therefore assume that hybrid decays can proceed through local deexcitation of this field rather then by quark tunneling in the external field of the meson source .",
    "thus the expectation value of the gluon operator in @xmath35 between excited ( hybrid ) and deexcited ( low lying meson decay products ) is used to obtain the effective @xmath34 production operator . in @xcite the chromoelectric @xmath36 and @xmath37 fields",
    "have been mapped onto the flux tube space of gluon excitations described by the phonon operators .",
    "using these expressions together with @xmath38 one then obtains @xmath39    this yields the following effective decay operator    @xmath40    where the @xmath41 are polarization vectors orthogonal to @xmath42 .",
    "the integral is defined along the @xmath43 axis only .",
    "integration over the transverse directions yields the factor @xmath44 which may be interpreted as the transverse size of the flux tube .",
    "note that the phonon operators represent gluonic excitations which are perpendicular to the @xmath43 axis .",
    "although this appears problematical in traditional perturbation theory , it is required here because , in the adiabatic limit , the gluonic field configuration must be defined in terms of the quark configuration and therefore the field expansion of the vector potential depends on the quark state under consideration .",
    "the decay amplitude for a hybrid @xmath45 into mesons @xmath46 and @xmath47 is then given by :    @xmath48\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath49 is the matrix element of the pauli matrices between quark spin wavefunctions , @xmath50 this amplitude should be multiplied by the appropriate flavor overlap and symmetry factor .",
    "the evaluation of the matrix elements is greatly facilitated by performing the angular integrals analytically .",
    "this may be achieved through use of the relations @xmath51 and    @xmath52    the resulting expression completely factorizes from the radial and flux tube integrals except for a trivial dependence on the wave in the final channel , greatly simplifying the algebra .",
    "we note the following general properties of the decay amplitude .",
    "the operator is nonzero only along the hybrid @xmath43 axis  as follows from the structure of the interaction hamiltonian .",
    "thus @xmath34 creation occurs on a line joining the original @xmath43 quarks , smeared over the transverse size of the flux tube .",
    "this is in contrast to the model of ikp which has transverse extent and a node along the @xmath43 axis .",
    "furthermore the spin operator contracts with the flux tube phonon polarization vector , which is absent in the ikp model . finally , the decay amplitude vanishes when the final mesons are identical due to the nodal structure in the vector potential .",
    "this is true for any single - phonon hybrid in an odd mode .",
    "thus one obtains the selection rule : low - lying hybrids do not decay to identical mesons .",
    "this subsumes the selection rule of ikp so that none of their qualitative conclusions are changed .",
    "however we also predict , for example , that hybrids do not decay to pairs of identical p - wave mesons .",
    "this rule has recently been shown to be more general than specific models @xcite .",
    "the preferred decay channels are to @xmath53 wave pairs@xcite .",
    "we stress that the selection rule forbidding @xmath54 wave final states no longer operates if the internal structure or size of the two s  wave states differ @xcite .",
    "another rule , the  spin selection \" rule , exists : if the @xmath55 in either hybrid or conventional mesons are in a net spin singlet configuration then decay into final states consisting only of spin singlet states is forbidden .",
    "this rule follows because pair creation is spin - triplet .",
    "it appears to be a universal feature in all non  relativistic decay models .    for @xmath56 states this selection rule distinguishes between conventional vector mesons which are @xmath57 or @xmath58 states and hybrid vector mesons where",
    "the @xmath55 are coupled to a spin singlet .",
    "for example , it implies that in the decay of hybrid @xmath59 , the channel @xmath60 is forbidden whereas @xmath61 is allowed ; this is quite opposite to the case of @xmath62 conventional mesons where the @xmath61 channel is relatively suppressed and @xmath60 is allowed @xcite .",
    "the extensive analysis of data in ref .",
    "@xcite revealed the clear presence of @xmath63 @xcite with a strong @xmath61 mode but no sign of @xmath60 , in accord with the hybrid situation .",
    "there are a number of amplitudes that vanish for the sho wave functions employed here in addition to those governed by the selection rules above .",
    "some of these decays vanish simply due to quantum numbers , e.g. @xmath64 to two vector mesons ( see the proof in appendix 1 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    some amplitudes vanish in both this work and the ikp model .",
    "these include all f  wave amplitudes for hybrid decay to two s  wave mesons , and all g  wave amplitudes .",
    "also , @xmath65 hybrid decays to two vector mesons vanishes .",
    "in addition , the decays @xmath66 and @xmath67 ; @xmath68 ; and @xmath69 vanish . alternatively , in the ikp model @xmath70 and",
    "@xmath71 vanish .",
    "the final step is to calculate hybrid widths .",
    "this involves choosing prescriptions for evaluating the decay phase space , the vertex coupling @xmath72 , and wavefunction parameters .",
    "the choice of the appropriate phase space is , unfortunately , a difficult issue to resolve ( it is discussed extensively in @xcite ) .",
    "for example , in our conventions standard relativistic phase space evaluates to    @xmath73    where @xmath74 is the energy of meson @xmath46 in the final state .",
    "this can differ substantially > from the nonrelativistic version :    @xmath75    especially when pions are in the final state . finally , we mention a third possibility employed by kokoski and isgur @xcite , called the ` mock meson ' method .",
    "the authors use    @xmath76    where @xmath77 refers to the ` mock meson ' mass of a state .",
    "this is defined to be the hyperfine - splitting averaged meson mass . in practice ,",
    "the numerical result is little different from the relativistic phase space except for the case of the pion , where a mock mass of @xmath78 gev is used .",
    "the net effect on low lying meson decays is to enhance the decay for processes with pions in the final state by a factor of @xmath79 for each pion in the final state .",
    "this procedure improved the fit to experimental data substantially .",
    "in fact , it is generally true that the @xmath3 model ( with relativistic phase space ) fits the data quite well except for the case where pions are in the final state .",
    "we have adopted a different approach to phase space which also solves this problem and which we believe is better physically motivated .",
    "we suggest @xcite that the root of the problem lies in the goldstone boson nature of the pion .",
    "this implies that a pion is not a simple @xmath14 state , but rather is collective in nature .",
    "an explicit way to incorporate this physics into a constituent quark model has been suggested by several groups@xcite .",
    "the method relies on constructing a nontrivial vacuum for qcd which breaks chiral symmetry .",
    "the pion may then be manifested as a goldstone mode by using the random phase approximation ( rpa ) to construct it .",
    "the point of interest to the current discussion is that in the random phase approximation the pion wavefunction contains backward moving pieces .",
    "these pieces allow new contributions to meson decay diagrams when pions are in the final state . in the chiral limit , the net result is quite simple : amplitudes with two pions in the final state should be multiplied by 3 ( over the naive quark model result ) , while those with a single pion in the final state should be multiplied by 2 .",
    "the efficacy of this prescription is illustrated in table 1 .",
    "ccccc & @xmath80 & @xmath81 & @xmath82 & @xmath83 no rpa & 0.71 & 0.53 & 0.46 & 0.42 rpa & 0.24 & 0.26 & 0.23 & 0.21    [ tablei ]    as can be seen , the improvement is dramatic .",
    "precisely the same argument applies to hybrid decays .",
    "thus our prescription is as follows : use relativistic phase space and the rpa pion factors mentioned above to arrive at the final decay amplitudes .",
    "the work of ikp was greatly expanded in close and page@xcite ; since one of the purposes of this work is to compare this model with ikp , we have both quoted the results of close and page below and have used their meson and hybrid meson wavefunction parameters as our  standard parameters \" ( these are discussed in the appendix ) .",
    "note that in order to calculate the ikp model predictions given below , we use the same normalization as in ref .",
    "@xcite , which corresponds to the @xmath3 pair creation parameter @xmath84 favored for mock meson phase space @xcite .",
    "although @xmath85 is preferred for relativistic phase space @xcite , ref .",
    "@xcite used @xmath86 for high mass meson resonances .",
    "we simply choose to retain @xmath84 .",
    "the normalization of this model is fixed to give the same average width as the ikp model for the decays of isovector hybrids to @xmath87 and @xmath88 with the `` standard parameters '' .",
    "this yields a coupling of @xmath89 gev@xmath90 .",
    "these particular decay modes were chosen because the two models can analytically be shown to mimic the predictions of each other in decays to two ground state or radially excited s  wave final states .",
    "thus decays to these final states may be regarded as `` model invariant '' . finally , as discussed above , we note that the absolute widths in the ikp model could be up to @xmath91 times bigger than the widths quoted here . furthermore , since phase space conventions and absolute magnitude conventions have changed since former ikp model calculations @xcite care should be taken with comparisons . indeed , the authors of ikp state that a model error of ( an additional ) factor of 2 should be allowed for in their predicted widths .    to make contact with the original development of this model@xcite and to illustrate the parameter dependence of the model predictions",

    "these parameters are also listed in the appendix .",
    "simple harmonic oscillator ( sho ) wavefunctions are used throughout for the final state mesons .",
    "this is typical of decay calculations and it has been demonstrated that using coulomb + linear wavefunctions does not change the results significantly@xcite . we have taken the following masses for the @xmath94 , @xmath95,@xmath96 , and @xmath97 hybrids : 1.8 , 2.0 , 4.1 , and 10.7 gev respectively .",

    "as stated earlier , we employ relativistic phase space and rpa pion factors and work in the narrow resonance approximation .",
    "we also extend the rpa prescription to kaons and @xmath102s ; but not to the @xmath117 .",
    "decay modes include all possible charge combinations , e.g. @xmath88 means @xmath118 and @xmath119 .    in the following tables we present the dominant widths for hybrid @xmath120 for various @xmath121 hybrids in partial wave @xmath122 .",

    "the main difference is that the hybrid and the decay mechanism have been written in terms of the degrees of freedom appropriate to the flux tube model ( ie .",

    "the model presented here is similar to  @xmath57 \" meson decay models whereas the ikp model is similar to @xmath3 models .",

    "amplitude ratios serve as a sensitive probe of the decay vertex and may be used to test models . for example , @xmath266 amplitude ratios tend to be significantly smaller in @xmath3 meson decay models than in @xmath57 models due to details of momentum routing . because of this it has been shown that @xmath3 models are heavily favored by the data@xcite .",
    "a similar situation exists between this model and that of ikp . for example , the @xmath266 amplitude ratio for @xmath267 is roughly 2 in the ikp model while it is 250 in this model . similarly the @xmath266 ratio for @xmath268 is 5 in the ikp model and 40 in this model .",
    "one can envision a time when these ratios may be experimentally determined and the models distinguished .",
    "hybrid states that have small total widths should be accessible experimentally . we find that for `` standard parameters '' the total width of the @xmath269 and @xmath95 @xmath66 hybrids are less than 100 mev in both models .",

    "the @xmath92 is difficult to accomodate as a conventional meson and makes a likely hybrid candidate .",
    "indeed , the experimental branching ratios agree spectacularly with our predictions .",
    "alternatively , it appears likely that the @xmath188 is a @xmath278 quarkonium state due to the small s - wave @xmath277 mode and the strong @xmath163 channel .",
