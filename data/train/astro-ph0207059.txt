    "this is the third in a series of papers dealing with the detailed study of the pulsational properties of a sample of field rr lyrae stars that were known to exhibit anomalous scatter and variations in the shape and amplitude of their light curves . in clementini",
    "( 1995b ; hereinafter paper i ) we reported results from a first photometric study of a sample of 8 field rr lyrae stars which , according to the literature , were classified as fundamental mode pulsators ( rrab ) with short periods and located at large heights _ z _ from the galactic plane ( castellani , maceroni & tosi 1983 ) .",
    "the circumstance of being far from the disc but with a period that for rrab usually corresponds to roughly solar metallicity made these stars fairly anomalous .",
    "the photometry presented in paper i demonstrated however that five out of the eight variables were more likely to pulsate in the first overtone mode , and that , therefore , the short period should not be taken as indicative of high metallicity .",
    "furthermore , it showed that some of the stars in the sample ( namely cm leonis , cu , bs and be comae ) exhibited irregularities in their light curves . in order to investigate the actual nature of these anomalies",
    "new observing campaigns were conducted on these four stars . in clementini",
    "( 2000 , paper ii ) we reported the discovery that cu comae is a _",
    "double - mode _ rr lyrae , the sixth detected in the field of our galaxy and the most metal - poor ever found .",
    "the present paper is devoted to the discussion of the results obtained for cm leonis ( cm leo ) from the combination of its paper i photometry with new data taken from 1995 to 1999 , and from high resolution spectroscopy obtained in 1999 .",
    "the observations and data sets are presented in section 2 . in section 3",
    "we discuss the results of the analysis of the complete photometric data set . in section 4",
    "we report the results of our spectroscopic analyses ( derivation of a radial velocity curve over the full pulsation cycle and elemental abundance analysis of the spectra of cm leo taken near minimum light ) . in section 5 ,",
    "we present results of the modeling of the observed light and radial velocity curves of cm leo , based on nonlinear pulsation models , computed with the same physical and numerical assumptions as in bono , castellani & marconi ( 2000 ) , and derive an estimate of the stellar mass , effective temperature , and distance modulus of the star .",
    "finally , in section 6 we summarize the main derived quantities of cm leo and discuss the absolute magnitude we derive for the star in the framework of the _ short _ and _ long _ distance scale dichotomy .",
    "according to the fourth edition of the general catalogue of variable stars ( kholopov et al .",
    "1985 , gcvs4 ) cm leo ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) is a fundamental mode rr lyrae star ( rrab ) with a rather short pulsation period p=0.@xmath8361732 and 1.10 mag amplitude in the photographic light variation .",
    "clementini et al .",
    "( 1995b ) obtained ccd _",
    "photometry of cm leo in 1994 . with a period p=0.@xmath8361479 they basically confirmed the periodicity of the gcvs4 , but showed that the light curve has a sinusoidal shape with amplitude of 0.49 mag , and appears to be split in two well - separated subcurves with about 0.1 mag difference in amplitude ( see figure 3a in paper i ) .",
    "clementini et al .",
    "( 1995b ) concluded that cm leo is a _",
    "c_-type rr lyrae with irregularities in its light curve .",
    "three different causes were suggested to possibly explain the anomaly in the light curve , namely double - mode or non - radial mode pulsation ( olech et al .",
    "1999 ) , and the blazhko effect ( blazhko 1907 ) . given the small number of data points ( 71 ) and the short time baseline ( 2 months ) , the 1994 observations were insufficient to pinpoint the actual source of the irregularities .",
    "new photometry of the star was obtained from 1995 to 1999 with the loiano 1.52 m telescope operated by the bologna observatory , and the 60 cm of the michigan state university ( msu ) .",
    "high resolution spectroscopy of the star was also obtained in 1999 , with the 2.7 m telescope of the mcdonald observatory .      the new photometric data of cm leo consist of _",
    "b , v , i _ ccd observations in the johnson - cousins photometric system defined by landolt ( 1983 , 1992 ) standard stars , obtained with the loiano 1.52 m telescope , on 27 nights from january 1995 to february 1999 .",
    "they were complemented by 171 and 30 v frames obtained with the msu 60 cm telescope in 1998 and on two consecutive nights in february 1999 , respectively . at both telescopes , the 1998 campaign consisted of several consecutive nights ( from 5 to 10 ) in three major runs about one month apart , to test both the possibility of double - mode or non - radial mode pulsation ( which are both known to occur on cycle - to - cycle timescales ) , and of the blazhko effect ( whose periodic modulation of the light curve has typical timescales of tens of days ) .",
    "in addition , the 1999 campaign consisted of two nights of coordinated observations at the loiano and msu telescopes , which allowed us to obtain continuous photometry of cm leo over 10.4 consecutive hours . this interval is larger than a full pulsation cycle of cm leo ( 8.7 hours ) thus permitting us to further check on the cycle - to - cycle nature of the irregularities in the light curve . on these same nights",
    "high resolution spectroscopy of the star was also secured with the 2.7 m telescope of the mcdonald observatory to obtain the radial velocity curve , and to perform a chemical abundance analysis .",
    "the journal of the photometric observations is given in table  1 .",
    "allowing for an evolution of about 0.08 mag off the zero age horizontal branch for the rr lyrae stars , as suggested by caputo & deglinnocenti ( 1995 ) , and caloi , dantona & mazzitelli ( 1997 ) , and a slope of 0.2 mag / dex for the luminosity - metallicity relation of rr lyrae s to correct cm leo absolute magnitude to the average metal abundance of the rr lyrae in the large magellanic cloud ( [ fe / h]=@xmath91.50 : alcock et al .",
    "1996 , bragaglia et al .",
    "2001a ) , the absolute magnitude we derive for cm leo implies a value for the true distance modulus of the lmc of @xmath3(lmc ) = 18.43@xmath40.06 mag , for an average dereddened luminosity of the rr lyrae in the lmc bar @xmath10=19.07@xmath40.05 ( clementini et al .",
    "2001 ) , in better agreement with the _ long _ astronomical distance scale .",
    "this paper is based on observations obtained with the 1.52 m telescope of the bologna observatory in loiano , the michigan state university 60 cm telescope , and the 2.7 m telescope of the mcdonald observatory .",
