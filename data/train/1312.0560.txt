    "galaxy interactions are one of the main mechanisms claimed for inducing star formation @xcite , where starbursts are fuelled by gas inflows produced by the tidal torques generated during the encounters . @xcite and",
    "@xcite performed statistical analysis of star formation activity of galaxy pairs showing that proximity in radial velocity and projected distance are correlated with an increase in the star formation activity .",
    "@xcite analyse close pairs and found an excess of blue galaxies with respect to the control sample and associate this phenomenon with a larger fraction of star forming galaxies .",
    "they also found that in close pairs , there is an increment in the fraction of red galaxies compared to systems without a near companion .",
    "the authors propose a scenario where galaxies in pairs have formed stars efficiently at early stages of their evolution , therefore , at present , they exhibit red colours .",
    "another interpretation is that the presence of dust stirred up during encounters could affect colours and probably , partially obscure the star formation activity .",
    "@xcite analysed the color distribution of close galaxy pairs finding an excess in both red and blue tails with respect to control samples .",
    "they also found that the trends still persists even after removing possible bias effects in the control sample selection .",
    "these results reinforce the claim that the excesses of blue and red galaxies are actually produced by galaxy interactions and not introduced by a biased selection .",
    "@xcite performed an analysis of close galaxy pairs in groups and clusters , finding that these pairs tend to reside in groups with low density global environments .",
    "the authors also showed that pair galaxies have a significant excess of young stellar population with respect to group member galaxies without near companion .",
    "recently , @xcite ( hereafter l12 ) stressed the importance of studying different types of interactions and they classified pair galaxies into three categories : pairs undergoing merging @xmath9 ; pairs with evident tidal features @xmath10 ; and non disturbed pairs @xmath11 .",
    "they also found an excess of galaxies in the blue peak in @xmath12 systems , while @xmath13 pairs show a larger fraction of galaxies in the red peak , compared to @xmath14 systems , specially for minor interactions .",
    "these results suggest that the variation of the blue and red peak locations of the color bimodal distribution could be driven by different aspects of galaxy interactions such as evolutionary stage , gas content , interaction strength , etc .",
    "in particular l12 highlight the contribution of tidal interactions to the read peak in the galaxy pairs colour distribution .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to focus in tidal interactions in order to analyse the role of this special type of encounters on the main properties of galaxies in interacting systems .",
    "tidal interactions in galaxy pairs can produce several morphological features that are short lived such as extended structures , bridges and tidal tails .",
    "observations indicate that the probability to have grand - design arms is much higher for galaxies in binaries or groups than in the field @xcite . @xcite and",
    "references therein show that the local fraction of tailed objects is about 1 - 2% of the local galaxy population , and that the size of the tidal tails is related to the global dynamical structure of the interacting galaxies .",
    "@xcite , points out that the tails in distant galaxies are shorter than those in nearby ones , reflecting the evolution with redshift of the sizes of spiral galaxies and their tidal structures .",
    "they also show that in simulated galaxies with low - mass halos , tidal tails turn out to be very long and the interacting galaxies merge very rapidly . besides many authors have found objects such as dwarf galaxies and globular clusters in tidal debris from galaxy interactions @xcite .    in this work we present an analysis of the galaxy properties in tidal interacting pairs , considering different types of morphological features that show this special type of systems .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : section 2 describes the data used in this work . in section 3",
    "we show the procedure used to construct the tidal interacting pair catalogue , explaining the classification process of tidal pair galaxies , and we also present the general properties of the catalogue .",
    "an analysis of star formation rates , colours and stellar population , and their dependence on the different classifications in our sample of tidal interactions is described in section 4 .",
    "in addition , host active galaxy properties and nuclear activity are analysed in this section . finally in section 5 , we summarize our main conclusions .    throughout this paper",
    "we adopt a cosmological model characterised by the parameters @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "data release 7 of sloan digital sky survey ( sdss - dr7 ) @xcite is the seventh major data release , corresponding to the completion of the survey sdss - ii .",
    "it comprises @xmath18 sq .",
    "deg . of imaging data , with an increment of @xmath19 sq .",
    ", over the previous data release , mostly in regions of low galactic latitude .",
    "sdss - dr7 provides imaging data for 357 million distinct objects in five bands , _ ugriz _ , as well as spectroscopy over @xmath20 steradians in the north galactic cap and @xmath21 square degrees in the south galactic cap .",
    "the average wavelengths corresponding to the five broad bands are @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26   @xcite . for details regarding the sdss camera",
    "see @xcite ; for astrometric calibrations see @xcite .",
    "the survey has spectroscopy over 9380 sq .",
    "deg . ; the spectroscopy is now complete over a large contiguous area of the northern galactic cap , closing the gap that was present in previous data releases .    in this work we analyse",
    "spectroscopic and photometric data extracted from sdss - dr7 .",
    "the spectroscopic data were derived from the main galaxy sample ( mgs ; @xcite ) obtained from the ` fits ` files at the sdss home page . for this sample ,",
    "k - corrections band - shifted to @xmath27 , were calculated using the software ` k - correct_v4.2 ` of @xcite .",
    "the photometric data were derived from the photometric catalogue constructed by @xcite .",
    "these authors compute photometric redshift and k - correction for the photometric data of the sdss - dr7 .",
    "the @xmath28 of the photometric redshift is @xmath29 0.0227 and k - corrections were obtained through joint parametrisation of redshift and reference frame ( at @xmath27 ) @xmath30 colour . for both data sets ,",
    "k - corrected absolute magnitudes were calculated from petrosian apparent magnitudes converted to the ab system .",
    "galaxies in tidal pairs are subject to diverse perturbations that may alter their morphology and generate peculiar features such as bridges and tails .",
    "this diversity of structures can be produced by differences in the internal nature of the galaxies in the tidal pair interactions .",
    "for this reason , the aim of this section is to present a sample of tidal pairs in order to explore the different types of such interactions .",
    "some recent statistical work focus on the construction of galaxy pair catalogues with different projected separation ( @xmath31 ) and relative radial velocity limits ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "@xcite found that galaxies with a close companion within @xmath33 and @xmath34 showed a higher star formation activity than isolated galaxies with similar redshift and luminosity distributions .",
    "@xcite , in an study of the effects of environment on interactions , constructed a sample of pairs with @xmath35 and @xmath2 selected from sdss - dr4 , finding that pairs in high density environments are characterised by wider separations and larger values of @xmath32 .",
    "more recently , @xcite presented a sample of pairs from sdss - dr7 with relative projected separation @xmath35 and relative radial velocities @xmath36 .",
    "these pairs show star formation rate ( sfr ) enhancements of 30@xmath37 out to at least @xmath38 .    in our previous work ( l12 )",
    "we build a catalogue of 1959 galaxy pairs with projected separation @xmath33 and relative radial velocities @xmath39 , within @xmath40 , finding 589 pairs that show tidal features . in order to obtain a larger number of pairs , and",
    "therefore improve the statistics , we extended this sample to @xmath41 and @xmath2 , and consider pairs with @xmath40 , where @xmath42 is the redshift of the brightest galaxy member of the system .",
    "in this way we obtain a sample of 1283 pair galaxies with tidal signatures .",
    "we performed an eye - ball classification using the sdss - dr7 imaging available in casjobs in order to distinguish between different classes of tidal interactions .",
    "we classified the sample taking into account the presence of either large scale tidal tails ( tt ) or a connecting bridge ( tb ) .",
    "thus , tt types are either pairs of two spiral galaxies or composed by a spiral and an elliptical galaxy while most tb systems consist of a pair of elliptical galaxies connected by a bridge .",
    "we found that 85% of the pairs were classified into these subsamples .",
    "the remaining pairs that do not fulfil these two categories were excluded from the present analysis .",
    "[ ej1 ] shows examples of tt and tb pairs .",
    "the visual inspection of the pairs was performed by all the authors dividing the total sample in subsamples of similar number of pairs .",
    "the reliability of the classification was addressed by a comparison of the classification of all authors in a common subsample .",
    "this comparison provides a classification uncertainty which we estimate of approximately 3% .    under these considerations the resulting spectroscopic tidal galaxy pair catalogue comprises a total of 1082 pairs .",
    "the sdss spectrograph uses fibres manually connected to plates in the telescope s focal plane .",
    "these fibres are mapped through a mosaic algorithm @xcite that optimises the observation of large - scale structures .",
    "two fibres can not be placed closer than 55 ",
    "@xcite , so for two objects with the same priority ( such as two mgs galaxies ) and whose centres are closer than 55  , the algorithm selects at random the galaxy which will be observed spectroscopically .",
    "there are regions where the plates overlap ( about @xmath43 of the mosaic regions ) , in which both objects may be observed . due to fibre collision",
    "the spectroscopic sample is affected by incompleteness .",
    "the magnitude limit of spectroscopic objects is @xmath44 , but not all galaxies brighter than this limit were observed .",
    "this issue becomes more important when analysing compact objects .",
    "recently , @xcite employed photometric redshift information to quantify this effect on the detection of triplets of galaxies in the sdss - dr7 .",
    "these authors conclude that photometric redshift provide very useful information , allowing to asses fibre collision incompleteness and complete the sample of triple systems at low redshift .    in order to recover pair systems lost due the fibre collision effect",
    ", we have include galaxies with photometric redshifts that have r - band magnitude @xmath45 . for each galaxy with spectroscopic measurements in the redshift range @xmath0 ,",
    "we have searched a photometric companion that have a projected distance @xmath41 and a relative radial velocity @xmath3 , this last value correspond to @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the mean photometric redshift error and @xmath48 is the speed of light .",
    "@xcite found that the 1@xmath47 interval provides a suitable compromise between high completeness and low contamination in the detection of triplets of galaxies .",
    "including photometric information allows us to increment the number of galaxies in the sample under analysis and , therefore , improve the statistical significance of our results .",
    "similarly to the spectroscopic catalogue , we perform an eye ball classification of this sample , finding 2043 spectro - photometric galaxy pairs with tidal signs .",
    "apart from the restriction on @xmath49 , the existence of tidal signatures reinforce that the galaxy pairs in the spectro - photometric sample are physical systems .",
    "about 78% of the pairs in this sample were classified as tt or tb , the remaining pairs that do not fulfil these two categories were excluded from the analysis .",
    "the resulting spectro - photometric tidal galaxy pair catalogue comprises a total of 1581 pairs .",
    "table 1 provides the classification and number of pairs in the spectroscopic and spectro - photometric tidal pair samples .",
    ".number of tt and tb pairs in the spectroscopic and spectro - photometric tidal pair samples [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in addition , we have explored which of the agn subclasses present higher median values of @xmath8 $ ] .",
    "the results are shown in columns @xmath50 and @xmath51 of table 6 .",
    "it can be noticed that galaxies classified as composite and ambiguous present noticeable differences between co and counter - rotating galaxy pairs for median values of @xmath8 $ ] being higher for the counter - rotating ones .",
    "the median of @xmath8 $ ] is almost identical ( within the estimated errors ) for seyfert and liner galaxies .",
    "this result suggests that these galaxies which have a dubious agn classification are those which have the strongest differences depending of the sense of rotation .",
    "this fact favours the interpretation of the different @xmath8 $ ] values according to the sense of rotation , as differences in the star formation activity rather than the agn itself . in this sense , @xcite ,",
    "compute the average contribution of the agn to the @xmath8 $ ] for a sample of composite galaxies and the agn - dominated galaxies taken from sdss .",
    "the results of their work indicate that the @xmath8 $ ] emission from composite galaxies comes , in a range of 50% to 90% from agn activity , while for agn - dominated galaxies , more than 90% of the @xmath8 $ ] comes from agn emission .",
    "once nuclear activity is triggered , the co - rotating vs. counter - rotating large scale structure becomes irrelevant , nuclear activity is a controlled by very localized small scale physics , see for instance @xcite .",
    "we have performed a statistical analysis of interacting pairs with tidal features , selected from sdss - dr7 . we obtained a spectroscopic sample considering @xmath1 and @xmath52 . with the aim to obtain better statistical results , for each galaxy with spectroscopic measurements",
    "we have searched a photometric companion with projected distance @xmath41 and a radial velocity difference @xmath53 .",
    "first , we divided the sample taking into account the presence of tidal tails ( tt ) or a connecting bridge ( tb ) .",
    "these subsamples exhibit similar distributions of @xmath42 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , while local environment , concentration index and color distributions are very different , showing that tb pairs have a higher fraction of galaxies residing in high density environments , present redder colours and exhibit a bulge - type morphology .",
    "the results found in this analysis persist even when considering control samples matched in @xmath42 , @xmath54 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 , suggesting that the so called ` red peak ' present in the color distribution of pair galaxies , is mostly populated by tidal interaction that comprises galaxies with a bridge ( tb ) . in this work ,",
    "we analyse in detail interactions with tidal tails ( tt ) between spiral galaxies , and we sub - classified these pairs according the sense of rotation of the spiral arms , by visual inspection of the images . then , we defined two categories : co - rotating and counter - rotating pairs .",
    "we can summarize the main results in the following conclusions .",
    "* we find that co - rotating systems doubles the number of the counter - rotating pairs , an effect that is present in both samples , spectroscopic and spectro - photometric catalogues",
    ". this could be due a combination of parallel spin preference in initial conditions of nearby halos , a more rapid evolution to merger , and a less effective tidal tail development .",
    "* we have studied separately galaxies without nuclear activity , and agn hosts in co and counter - rotating tidal pairs .",
    "the percentages of co and counter - rotating tidal systems show the same result as mentioned above in both pair samples .",
    "we also find similar distributions of redshift , stellar mass content and r - band absolute magnitude for samples of agn and non - agn galaxies in co and counter - rotating pairs .",
    "* for galaxies with no agn activity we find that counter - rotating systems have a higher star formation rate and a younger stellar population .",
    "this effect is stronger in the sample with @xmath4 , as expected due to the larger tidal effects associated to closer encounters .",
    "* we find that the distributions of @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 of agn host galaxies present a small difference in the behaviour of the two subsamples , showing that counter - rotating hosts have a higher fraction of galaxies with bluer colours and younger stellar population than their co - rotating counterpart . *",
    "the agn sample was classified into composite , seyfert , liner and ambiguous following the @xcite scheme finding no significant differences in the position of agn in co and counter rotating pairs regarding this classification .",
    "* as a tracer of the agn activity , we analysed the dust - corrected luminosity of the [ oiii]@xmath585007 line , @xmath8 $ ] .",
    "we find that , in counter - rotating hosts , the agn classified as composite and ambiguous have a slightly enhanced nuclear activity .",
    "nevertheless , the median of the @xmath8 $ ] values is almost identical ( within the estimated errors ) for seyfert and liner galaxies .",
