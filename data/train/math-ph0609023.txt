    "growth problems of laplacian type ( such as hele - shaw viscous flows ) refer to dynamics of a moving front ( an interface ) between two distinct phases driven by a harmonic scalar field .",
    "these essentially nonlinear and non - local problems attract much attention for quite a long time @xcite .",
    "remarkably , laplacian growth with vanishing surface tension possesses an integrable structure uncovered in @xcite .",
    "since evolution of planar domains is most naturally described by time - dependent conformal maps , there is no surprise that this structure is actually immanent for general conformal maps and classical boundary value problems .",
    "specifically , in @xcite it has been shown that evolution of conformal maps is governed by an integrable hierarchy of nonlinear partial differential equations which is a zero dispersion version @xcite of the 2d toda hierarchy @xcite .",
    "in fact the lax equations for this hierarchy can be derived from the classical theory of conformal maps depending on parameters .    in the present paper",
    "we have tried to give a short review of these and related developments in the context of the integrable systems theory .",
    "taking the lax representation of the dispersionless 2d toda ( dtoda ) hierarchy as a starting point , we follow how it induces the contour dynamics and dynamics of conformal maps .",
    "the lax function , which is supposed to be univalent in some neighborhood of infinity , is interpreted as a conformal map from a fixed reference domain to the complement of the growing domain .",
    "depending on the type of solutions to the dtoda hierarchy , the growing domains can be either smooth or singular like cuts or slits .",
    "hence the system of dispersionless lax equations serves as a master dynamical equation not only for laplacian growth but also for growth of slits .",
    "conformal maps of parametric families of slit domains are known to satisfy a differential equation proposed by k.lwner in 1923 @xcite .",
    "its connection with nonlinear integrable equations was pointed out in @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , we demonstrate how the radial lwner equation arises in the context of the dtoda hierarchy .",
    "the unified treatment of the two types of growth processes in the framework of the toda integrable system , which we emphasize in this paper , seems to be especially promising in the light of the stochastic lwner evolution ( sle ) approach @xcite .",
    "this might give a hint how to incorporate , in an intelligent way , a stochastic ingredient into growth problems of laplacian type .",
    "an instructive representation of solutions to the dtoda hierarchy is provided by the large @xmath0 limit of certain matrix integrals or their eigenvalue versions ( the dyson gas representation ) , with the associated growth processes being simulated by evolution of support of eigenvalues . in the last section we outline the dyson gas representation for laplacian growth and growth of slits .",
    "section 2 contains the necessary material on the dtoda hierarchy and its lax representation . in section 3",
    "we present the general solution to the hierarchy in terms of canonical transformations and distinguish the classes of non - degenerate and degenerate solutions . in section 4",
    "we associate a contour dynamics with any solution to the lax equations .",
    "a particular subclass of degenerate solutions is studied in section 5 , where the lwner equation is derived from the lax equations .",
    "finally , section 6 contains the dyson gas representation for both non - degenerate and degenerate solutions .",

    "in @xcite it was shown that the function @xmath25 can be expressed through @xmath44 in the following different but equivalent ways : [ confmap1 ] rw(z)= z e^-d(z)_t_0f [ confmap2 ] rw(z)=z- a -d(z)_t_1f [ confmap3 ] rw^-1(z)= d(z ) _",
    "|t_1f where [ r1 ] 2r = , a = and the operator @xmath158 is defined in section 2 .",
    "the consistency of these relations follows from equations of the dtoda hierarchy .",
    "the 2d dtoda hierarchy can be written in a generating form as [ toda1 ] d(z_1)d(z_2)f= [ toda3 ] - d(z_1)|d(z_2)f= ( 1- ) together with complex conjugate equations ( cf . eqs .",
    "( [ dtoda7 ] ) , ( [ dtoda7a ] ) which are @xmath5-derivatives of ( [ toda1 ] ) , ( [ toda3 ] ) ) .",
    "we emphasize that all the relations given above hold true for _ any _ measure @xmath142 in ( [ taun ] ) provided the most favorable configuration of @xmath152 s at @xmath151 is well defined .",
    "if the measure is smooth , say @xmath159 , then this construction gives non - degenerate solutions to the dtoda hierarchy discussed in section 3 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath70 is just the generating function of the canonical transformation ( [ m3 ] ) , hence the notation .",
    "singular measures @xmath142 lead to degenerate solutions .",
    "in particular , one may consider the measure supported on a curve @xmath111 , then the integral ( [ taun ] ) becomes one - dimensional ( along @xmath111 ) in each variable : [ taun1 ] _",

    "the function @xmath25 maps the slit domain @xmath160 onto the exterior of the unit circle .",
    "the choice of the measure supported on a curve means a reduction of the dtoda hierarchy .",
    "a familiar example is the dtoda chain , where one may take @xmath111 to be either real or imaginary axis . consider a general ( continuous ) curve @xmath111 infinite in both directions .",
    "it is clear that @xmath25 and the lax functions ( the functions inverse to @xmath25 and @xmath161 ) depend on the times through two parameters only .",
    "one can set them to be , for example , the positions of the two ends of the arc @xmath153 on the curve @xmath111 .",
    "this is a reduction of rank 2 .",
    "the simplest way to obtain a reduction of rank 1 is to take the measure @xmath142 supported on a half - infinite curve starting at a point @xmath105 such that the arc @xmath153 always starts at @xmath105 as the times independently vary in some open set .",

    "<S> this paper is a short review of the connection between certain types of growth processes and the integrable systems theory , written from the viewpoint of the latter . starting from the dispersionless lax equations for the 2d toda hierarchy , we interpret them as evolution equations for conformal maps in the plane . </S>",
    "<S> this provides a unified approach to evolution of smooth domains ( such as laplacian growth ) and growth of slits . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the lwner differential equation for a parametric family of conformal maps of slit domains arises as a consistency condition for reductions of the dispersionless toda hierarchy . </S>",
