    "<S> such wave fields obey a system of coupled non - linear equations that can be written by means of a suitable non - hamiltonian bracket . as an example </S>",
    "<S> , the theory is applied to the relaxation dynamics of the spin - boson model . in the adiabatic limit , a good agreement with calculations performed by the operator approach is obtained . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the theory proposed in this paper can take nonadiabatic effects into account without resorting to surface - hopping approximations . hence , </S>",
    "<S> the results obtained follow qualitatively those of previous surface - hopping calculations and increase by a factor of ( at least ) two the time length over which nonadiabatic dynamics can be propagated with small statistical errors . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it is worth to note that the dynamics of quantum - classical wave fields here proposed is a straightforward non - hamiltonian generalization of the formalism for non - linear quantum mechanics that weinberg introduced recently . </S>"
