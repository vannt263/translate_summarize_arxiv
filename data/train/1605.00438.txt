    "to begin with , let us derive the inequalities discussed in this paper .",
    "the derivation is surprisingly simple .",
    "consider the simplest bell scenario , where alice and bob share a quantum state , alice ( bob ) performs a measurement depending on a given bit @xmath2 ( @xmath14 ) to obtain the outcome bit @xmath8 ( @xmath15 ) .",

    "the projector of the measurement for alice s outcome @xmath8 is given by @xmath23 , and for bob s outcome @xmath15 by @xmath24 .",
    "let us then consider the weighted chsh expression @xcite of the form : @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are real non - negative parameters , and @xmath28 is introduced for later convenience .",
    "if we define @xmath29 , it can be seen that @xmath30 , and we obtain the tsirelson - type inequality as follows : @xmath31 where we used @xmath32 as a constraint in the last inequality .",
    "the quantity @xmath33 is defined by @xmath34 where the maximization is taken over all hermitian operators @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is bob s subnormalized state when alice is given @xmath2 and her outcome is @xmath8 .",
    "the quantity @xmath33 is quite analogous to the generalized trace distance @xmath37 ( the extension of the trace distance to subnormalized states ) . indeed , both agree with each other for the case of pure states . for the other general cases , @xmath38",
