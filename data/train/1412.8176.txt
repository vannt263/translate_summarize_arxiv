    "we want to apply the approach of continuous unitary transformations ( cut ) to two archetypical impurity models which exhibit the _ kondo effect _ , the kondo model and the anderson impurity model @xcite .",
    "the kondo effect is one of the fundamental problems of many - body theory as it appears in a wide range of correlated electron systems , for instance in heavy - fermion systems @xcite , in mott - hubbard metal - insulators @xcite and in nanoscale quantum dots @xcite . in such models ,",
    "a wide range of energy scales is important @xcite : from the bath electrons bandwidth @xmath1 , which can be of the order of several ev , down to the exponentially small kondo temperature @xmath0 .",
    "the challenge to treat the exponentially small kondo energy scale reliably has first been solved by the numerical renormalization group ( rg ) @xcite .",
    "a bethe ansatz solution put the results on a rigorous foundation @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", the issue has attracted much attention in the field of renormalization approaches .",
    "the functional rg approach was applied to the anderson impurity model @xcite yielding good results for small and intermediate interactions , but failing to reproduce the exponentially small kondo energy scale in the strong coupling regime .",
    "subsequently , a series of papers @xcite tried different variants of the functional rg approach to reproduce this small energy scale . while the successes in the regime of small to intermediate couplings were very interesting , the strong coupling regime eluded a description by functional rg .",
    "only recently , streib and co - workers provided a functional rg approach with the correct strong - coupling approach @xcite .",
    "the additional key element in their study is to use a large magnetic field as flow parameter which is gradually lowered to zero .",
    "furthermore , ward identities and partial bosonization of the spin degrees of freedom are exploited .",
    "the idea to treat the problem first at large magnetic fields where perturbation theory is perfectly well - controlled and then reducing the field gradually has been put forward by hewson and collaborators in a series of papers @xcite .",
    "besides this key idea they rely on perturbation theory in the renormalized effective interaction calling their approach renormalized perturbation theory ( rpt ) .",
    "all these intensive studies performed in the last decade illustrate that the anderon impurity model in the strong coupling regime represents a formidable methodological challenge .    in the present article ,",
    "we want to show that continuous unitary transformations are also able to treat the strong coupling limit of the anderson impurity model , i.e. , the kondo model with its exponentially small energy scale .",
    "continuous unitary transformations exhibit an intrinsic energy separation because processes at higher energies are transformed faster than processes at lower energies .",
    "this feature is similar to standard rg approaches .",
    "the cut approach can be set up non - perturbatively so that it is able to derive effective models even at exponentially low energies .",
    "there are a number of applications of cuts to the kondo problem .",
    "results of conventional `` poor man s scaling '' @xcite could be reproduced by a cut in which diverging differential equations occur @xcite .",
    "this divergence indicates the kondo energy scale .",
    "another application of the cut to the kondo model @xcite results in an effective model where the matrix elements of the effective interaction still exhibit logarithmic infrared divergences very similar to those found in a standard perturbative treatment @xcite . furthermore , there are cut approaches to the kondo model which succeed in the derivation of a finite , convergent effective models .",
    "but these approaches profit from a detour via the bosonized form of the kondo model @xcite .",
    "cuts were also applied to the anderson impurity model @xcite . but none of them revealed the exponential character of the kondo temperature @xmath2 . nevertheless , an important previous work has been able to retrieve and to improve the schrieffer - wolff transformation @xcite.this approach has been extended recently to impurities which hybridize with a superconducting environment @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we show that cuts yield the correct low - energy physics of the kondo model and of the anderson impurity model .",
    "our approach does not rely on a bosonized reformulation .",
    "staying in a purely fermionic description leads to convergence problems as one encounters diverging couplings @xcite .",
    "but we will show that a change of the reference state during the flow solves this problem avoiding the diverging couplings and yielding a finite , convergent effective low - energy model characterized by the exponentially small energy scale of the kondo temperature .",

    "the basics of the cuts are presented . in the next section ,",
    "the kondo model is briefly introduced and its standard treatment by means of cuts is shown .",

    "iii a modified approach with a change of the reference state is introduced which allows us to derive a finite , well - defined effective model .",

    "iv , the anderson impurity model is tackled by the standard cut which again implies a diverging flow .",

    "the continuous unitary transformation ( cut ) , also called flow equation approach , is a powerful method of theoretical quantum mechanics aiming at the systematic derivation of effective low - energy models .",

    "their commutators have to to be computed as well leading to even more terms and so on .",
    "this procedcure leads to a proliferating number of emerging terms .",

    "if the couplings @xmath64 are small enough , for instance during the early stages of the flow , the ground state is the fermi sea .",
    "the reason is that the spin - spin interactions do not have any effect on the fermi sea because all bath sites are either empty or doubly occupied so that there is no spin present . in order to have any effect , a spin in the bath",
    "must be created by either adding a fermion above the fermi level or removing one from below the fermi level . this costs energy .",

    "this fact makes an exhaustive analysis of the effective model challenging .    in order to obtain the modified flow equation ( [ flow equation ] )",
    ", we commute the generator ( [ chapter 7 generator for the full problem new operator basis ] ) with the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian new operator basis full model ] ) .",
    "we truncate terms which have a quartic structure in the fermionic bath operators .",
    "the resulting flow equation reads    [ flow_kondo_modified ] @xmath128    @xmath129    @xmath130    where @xmath131 is the expectation value with respect to the fermi sea .",
    "it occurs upon the normal - ordering of the fermionic bath operators with respect to the fermi sea .",

    "the results obtained by the modified approach are presented .",
    "[ fig : rod_kondo_n40_l2_j02 ] depicts the rod of the kondo model in the modified approach .",
    "the aim is to verify that the flow converges .    .",
    "first , the fermi sea is the reference state and ( [ deq poor mans scaling with cut kondo ] ) is solved with the initial values ( [ starting values kondo model ] ) . after changing the reference state",
    "the modified flow is solved .",
    "the modified flow converges in contrast to the original cut .",
    "the rod for the original cut ( [ deq poor mans scaling with cut kondo ] ) without changing the reference state is denoted by the dashed line . ]",
    "we start from the kondo hamiltonian and solve the original flow ( [ deq poor mans scaling with cut kondo ] ) with the initial values ( [ starting values kondo model ] ) .",
    "this implies that the fermi sea is the reference state . for small @xmath3",
    "the ratio @xmath106 is significantly smaller than @xmath107 , cf .",
    "( [ ratio at which the singlet forms ] ) , and the flow proceeds as long as this holds true . at some value @xmath132 the spin - spin coupling @xmath64 becomes large enough so that @xmath133 is fulfilled .",
    "as soon as this happens , we change the reference state and rewrite the hamiltonian in the form ( [ hamiltonian new operator basis full model ] ) with the modified operator basis ( [ used_states_adapted_operator_basis ] ) .",
    "then , we use the modified flow and continue with the flow starting at @xmath132 .",
    "all sets of differential equations are solved by a @xmath134th - order runge - kutta algorithm .    for small @xmath3",
    "the rod is the same as for the original flow ( [ deq poor mans scaling with cut kondo ] ) because the reference state is not changed yet .",
    "once we switch to the modified reference state , the rod changes discontinuously because the generator is changed so that other types of terms are included in the rod .",
    "one may wonder why the rod increases upon changing the reference state although we aim at eliminating less terms than before .",
    "recall that we only rotate away terms that couple to the singlet states .",
    "but one must also bear in mind that we include completely different types of terms in the generator after the change to the modified operator basis .",
    "in particular , terms that are diagonal in the fermionic bath operators are then included which were not included before . for instance , we may inspect terms of the form @xmath135 with initial values at @xmath132 that are proportional to @xmath136 .",
    "such terms were not eliminated by the cut in the conventional , original operator basis .",
    "thus , at @xmath112 these terms are large compared to the terms in the generator before the reference state is changed which have been suppressed by a factor @xmath137 . once the reference state is changed , these diagonal terms in the fermionic bath operators are included in the rod .",
    "thus , the rod increases abruptly upon switching the reference state and using the modified generator .",
    "the dashed line in fig .  [ fig : rod_kondo_n40_l2_j02 ] shows the behavior of the rod if the reference state is not changed . in this case",
    "the rod diverges at @xmath138 corresponding to the kondo temperature @xmath0 .",
    "we conclude that the modified flow equation is indeed able to prevent this divergence leading to an effective hamiltonian with finite couplings even at the fermi level @xmath139 .",

    "the inverse energy scale @xmath132 is increasing proportionally to the inverse of the kondo temperature .",
    "the factor @xmath55 from ( [ discretization effect on tk ] ) is due to the discretization . ]",
    "we succeeded to provide a method that yields an effective hamiltonian with small finite parameters for @xmath140 . with the conventional , original approach we found the kondo energy scale only as the point at which the running couplings diverge @xcite .",

    "we retrieve the exponential energy scale @xmath141 where the factor @xmath55 is given by ( [ discretization effect on tk ] ) taking discretization effects into account @xcite .",
    "thus , we confirm that the energy scale at which the reference state is changed is proportional to the kondo temperature @xmath0 , at least at the level of accuracy of the present study .     and @xmath142 from ( [ chapter 7 effective hamiltonian without interaction part energy levels ] ) for the kondo model with @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "the quantity @xmath143 converges to the binding energy of the kondo singlet for @xmath144 . ]",
    "in addition , there is another very interesting energy scale in the effective model which is the _ binding energy _ of the singlets .",
    "this energy is the energy by which the singlets are separated from the fermi sea states with a localized spin on the impurity .",
    "note that this does not imply that the system is gapped because the other fermionic sites still exist and represent massless excitations in the continuum limit .",
    "we can identify the local binding energy easily as the energy difference @xmath145 of the two lowest energies @xmath142 and @xmath146 in the diagonal part ( [ chapter 7 effective hamiltonian without interaction part energy levels ] ) of the hamiltonian ( [ chapter 7 effective hamiltonian without interaction part ] ) where the @xmath147 are diagonalized first , cf .",

    "we draw the reader s attention to the fact that @xmath145 can only be interpreted as the binding energy for @xmath144 because only then the ground state of the effective model will be the singlet state . for smaller @xmath3",
    "there are still interaction terms present that act on the singlet state which vanish in the limit @xmath144 .    upon increasing @xmath3",
    ", @xmath156 increases rapidly until it converges towards the binding energy of the singlet state @xmath157 .",
    "the binding energy is analyzed in fig .",

    "we find an exponential behavior of the form @xmath158 where the discretization factor @xmath55 is given by ( [ discretization effect on tk ] ) .",
    "hence , we conclude that the modified cut approach not only yields an effective hamiltonian with finite couplings , but also results in a model in which the kondo energy scale is already manifest in the diagonal part .",
    "it is no longer hidden within the intricate interplay of different physical processes .",
    "recall that earlier cut approaches led to diverging couplings @xcite or to an effective model where the parameters exhibited logarithmic infrared divergences very similar to those found by a standard perturbative treatment @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the detour via a bosonized form of the kondo model was taken @xcite .",
    "the mapping of the fermionic kondo model to the bosonized one is systematically controlled only in the wide band limit .",
    "in the last two sections we considered the kondo model first in the standard cut akin to poor man s scaling and second with a change of reference state . the first approach yields diverging couplings while the second provides a well - defined effective model with finite couplings . in the present section and in the next one we will extend these treatments to the anderson impurity model .",
    "we consider the anderson impurity model in its standard form @xcite @xmath159 if we discretize it in the energy representation employing the formulae ( [ discretization parameters flat dos ] ) we obtain @xmath160    the schrieffer - wolff transformation to a kondo - type model has been realized already in the early days of cuts @xcite and extended recently to superconducting hosts @xcite . here",
    ", we use a slightly different approach to eliminate the hybridization elements @xmath161 .",
    "we consider a discretized flat density of states ( dos ) ( [ discretization flat dos ] ) and choose the ground state of @xmath162 as the reference state where @xmath163 is the occupation operator of the @xmath164-level @xmath165    in the present article , we restrict ourselves to the particle - hole symmetric cases .",
    "then , the singly occupied impurity state is the lowest - lying eigenstate of ( [ initial diagonal anderson hamiltonian for schrieffer wolff trafo ] ) and thus there are two degenerate reference states with a spin degree of freedom at the impurity .",
    "hence we have to use a reference ensemble for the impurity operators and the normal - ordering scheme employed is defined by @xmath166    in order to be able to use sign generators similar to , it must be evident which change of energy they induce .",
