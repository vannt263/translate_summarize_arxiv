    "this radiation can be utilized for a variety of applications in material science , biophysics and industrial imaging @xcite .    in a cfel",
    ", an electron beam skims over the surface of a thin dielectric slab placed over an ideal conductor , and resonantly interacts with the surface electromagnetic mode supported by the system , resulting in emission of coherent radiation .",
    "sp - fel is similar to cfel , except that the  dielectric slab placed over an ideal conductor is replaced with a metallic reflection grating . over the last few decades , several efforts have been made to realize the generation of coherent radiation from cfel @xcite and sp - fel  @xcite systems .",
    "the coherent emission of radiation with average power of the order of tens of @xmath1w was reported from a single slab based cfel at enea frascati centre  @xcite .",
    "subsequently , fisch and walsh  @xcite used a low energy electron beam ( @xmath230 - 200 kev ) to drive a sapphire based cfel .",
    "an efficient and compact version of the device described in ref .",
    "@xcite , which uses a very low energy ( @xmath2 30 kev ) electron beam was tested at the dartmouth college  @xcite for the generation of thz radiation .",
    "the observed output power in the dartmouth experiment  @xcite was very low ( @xmath2 picowatt ) , and authors in ref .",
    "@xcite suggested that a good quality flat electron beam can be used to enhance the output power of the system .",
    "recently , under the joint research of osaka sangyo university and kansai university , experimental studies on a double slab based cfel have been performed .",
    "experimental studies on sp - fel system have been performed at the dartmouth college  @xcite and vanderbilt university  @xcite in usa , and cea / cesta  @xcite in france .",
    "the power level attained in all these experiments have been low . in order to obtain a copious coherent radiation from the @xmath0erenkov and smith - purcell fels , an enhanced understanding of these systems",
    "is required ; which includes analysing the realistic effects due to diffraction and attenuation of the surface mode supported by these systems , and then working out the requirement on electron beam parameters , which is very critical for the performance of the system . although for the case of sp - fel , the requirement on electron beam parameters taking the effect of diffraction and attenuation  @xcite have been worked out in refs .",
    "@xcite , a similar analysis has not been presented for the case of cfel . in this paper , we perform such an analysis to work out the electron beam requirements for the case of cfel , taking the effect due to diffraction and attenuation into account .",
    "while doing so , we also highlight important differences in the analyses of cfel and sp - fel .",
    "a schematic of @xmath0erenkov fel is shown in fig .  1 , where a flat electron beam is skimming at a height @xmath3 over a thin dielectric slab placed over an ideal conductor .",
    "the surface mode supported in this system is evanescent in the @xmath4-direction . in most of the earlier analyses",
    "@xcite , translational invariance is assumed along the @xmath5-direction , namely the horizontal direction . due to this assumption ,",
    "the surface mode supported by the structure has no variation in the @xmath5-direction . in this paper , we call such a surface mode as the non - localized surface mode , and the theory which describes the interaction of an electron beam with the non - localized surface mode as the two - dimensional ( 2d ) theory . recently , we have performed a rigorous 2d analysis @xcite of a @xmath0erenkov fel by setting up the maxwell - lorentz equations in both linear and non - linear regime .",
    "it was shown that for generation of terahertz radiation in a cfel , the required beam profile is thin in the vertical direction , and wide in the horizontal direction .",
    "hence , we used a flat electron beam with vanishing thickness in the vertical direction , and infinite width in the horizontal direction , in our analysis .",
    "the analytical expressions for the small - signal gain and the growth rate of cfel were derived for this case . in a realistic situation ,",
    "the electron beam size as well as radiation beam size will be finite .",
    "size of the radiation beam will increase due to diffraction .",
    "this will affect the overlap of the radiation beam with the electron beam , resulting in reduction of the small - signal gain , as well as the saturated power obtained in the device .",
    "a realistic estimate of diffraction effects therefore requires a detailed three - dimensional ( 3d ) analysis of the electromagnetic surface mode .",
    "one way to invoke three - dimensional effects is to solve the electromagnetic helmholtz wave equation by considering the diffraction in the surface mode .",
    "andrew and brau @xcite assumed the electron beam as a plasma dielectric , and solved the wave equation with diffraction effects to evaluate the growth rate of the cfel .",
    "this approach works well in the linear regime .",
    "growth rate was found to be decreasing on the accounts of the 3d effects as compared to the 2d analysis . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the analysis was performed for an uniform electron beam having infinite vertical size , hence , the derived results are not very useful to obtain the electron beam parameters in the vertical direction .",
    "another way to consider the 3d effects , which we follow in this paper , is to construct a localized surface mode by combining the plane waves propagating at different angles in the ( @xmath6 ) plane , with a suitable weight factor .",
    "the surface mode constructed in this way is localized in the horizontal direction and represents a realistic situation .",
    "the technique of localization of electromagnetic modes by using superposition of plane waves is a standard technique in laser optics discussions also @xcite , and has been applied for the case of grating based fel by kim and kumar @xcite .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "ii  b. in sec .",
    "ii  c , we set up the 3d coupled maxwell - lorentz equations for the system .",
    "earlier analyses of @xmath0erenkov fel in single slab geometry have neglected the effect of attenuation due to dielectric and conductor , which we include in the analysis presented in sec .",
    "ii . next , in sec . iii a , we review the 2d analysis of smith - purcell fel  @xcite .",

    "we also discuss the techniques to relax these stringent requirements , and also the methods for production of electron beam of required quality . in sec .",

    "an electron beam with vanishing thickness in the @xmath4-direction , is propagating with a velocity @xmath7 along the @xmath8-direction at a height @xmath3 above the dielectric surface .",
    "the dielectric slab has length @xmath9 , thickness @xmath10 and relative dielectric constant @xmath11 .",
    "the dielectric slab extends uniformly along the @xmath5-axis , and the 2d electromagnetic surface mode supported by this structure does not have any variation along the @xmath5-direction . to have an effective interaction with the electron beam , we want the electric field component in the @xmath8-direction .",
    "the appropriate surface mode for this structure can be taken as the tm mode , which has the magnetic field only in the @xmath5-direction , namely @xmath12 and the components of the electric field can be obtained from @xmath12 by using maxwell equation .",
    "the longitudinal component of the electric field is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the amplitude of the field at the location of the electron beam i.e. , @xmath4=0 , @xmath15 is the electron phase , @xmath16 is the propagation wavenumber in the @xmath8-direction , @xmath17=@xmath18 , @xmath19 is the speed of light , @xmath20 is the free space wavelength and @xmath21=@xmath22 is a positive quantity , which means that the amplitude of the surface mode decays in the @xmath4-direction .    the electron beam interacts with the co - propagating surface mode , and develops micro - bunching at the wavelength of the surface mode .",
    "this results in a sinusoidal component of electron beam current , having frequency @xmath17 and wavenumber @xmath16 , same as that of the surface mode .",
    "this component of the beam current generates an evanescent electromagnetic wave , again having frequency @xmath17 and wavenumber @xmath16 , and amplitude that decays exponentially with distance from the beam .",
    "the evanescent wave is incident on the dielectric surface , and gets reflected with a reflectivity @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are constants , which depend on @xmath17 , @xmath16 , and intrinsic parameters of the system .",
    "here , @xmath26 is the growth rate of incident evanescent wave , which is physically understood as resulting due to exponential enhancement in the micro - bunching , as the beam propagates , due to its interaction with the surface mode .",
    "analytical formula for the reflectivity is derived by satisfying the appropriate boundary conditions at different interfaces in fig .  1 , and",
    "this gives the expressions for @xmath24 and @xmath25 , which are provided in ref .",
    "note that in this approach , if @xmath27 , the reflectivity becomes singular , for frequency @xmath17 and wavenumber @xmath16 satisfying the dispersion relation . in that case , the dielectric slab placed on the metallic conductor supports the surface electromagnetic mode in the absence of any incident wave , as expected .",
    "the reflected wave further interacts with the co - propagating electron beam , resulting in enhancement of micro - bunching , and consequently the amplitude of the incident evanescent wave further increases .",
    "this phenomenon continues till the amplitude of the surface mode saturates due to nonlinearity .",
    "the evolution of the amplitude @xmath14 of the surface mode discussed here is mathematically described by the following time - dependent differential equation , which includes attenuation of the surface mode : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the group velocity of the surface mode in unit of @xmath19 , which can be computed from the dispersion curve of the surface mode .",
