    "the interplay of stars and their surrounding gas leads to the presence of distinct phases in the interstellar medium ( ism ) of galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) . diffuse atomic clouds ( the cold neutral medium , cnm ) have densities of about @xmath0 and temperatures of about @xmath1 , where atomic hydrogen is largely neutral but carbon is singly ionized by photons with energies between @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the warmer ( @xmath4 ) and more tenuous ( @xmath5 ) intercloud phase is heated and ionized by fuv and euv photons escaping from hii regions @xcite , usually referred to as the warm neutral medium ( wnm ) and warm ionized medium ( wim ) .",
    "the phases of the ism are often globally considered to be in thermal equilibrium and in pressure balance @xcite .",
    "however , the observed large turbulent width and presence of gas at thermally unstable , intermediate temperatures attests to the importance of heating by kinetic energy input .",
    "in addition , the ism also hosts molecular clouds , where hydrogen is in the form of @xmath6 and self - gravity plays an important role .",
    "all of these phases are directly tied to key questions on the origin and evolution of the ism , including the energetics of the cnm , wnm and the wim ; the evolutionary relationship of atomic and molecular gas ; the relationship of these ism phases with newly formed stars ; and the conversion of their radiative and kinetic power into thermal and turbulent energy of the ism ( e.g. @xcite ) .    the neutral phases of the ism have been studied using optical and uv observations of atomic lines .",
    "these observations can provide the physical conditions but are limited to pinpoint experiments towards bright background sources and are hampered by dust extinction @xcite . at radio wavelengths , dust extinction is not important and observations of the 21 cm hyperfine transition of neutral atomic hydrogen have been used to study the neutral phases ( e.g. @xcite ) . on a global scale , these observations have revealed the prevalence of the two phase structure in the interstellar medium of cold clouds embedded in a warm intercloud medium but they have also pointed out challenges to this theoretical view @xcite .",
    "it has been notoriously challenging to determine the physical characteristics ( density , temperature ) of the neutral structures in the ism as separating the cold and warm components is challenging ( e.g. @xcite ) . in this context ,",
    "carbon radio recombination lines ( crrls ) provide a promising tracer of the neutral phases of the ism ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "carbon has a lower ionization potential ( 11.2  ev ) than hydrogen ( 13.6  ev ) and can be ionized by radiation fields in regions where hydrogen is largely neutral .",
    "recombination of carbon ions with electrons to high rydberg states will lead to crrls in the sub - millimeter to decameter wavelength range .",
    "carbon radio recombination lines have been observed in the interstellar medium of our galaxy towards two types of clouds : diffuse clouds ( e.g. : @xcite ) and photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) , the boundaries of hii regions and their parent molecular clouds ( e.g. : @xcite ) . the first low frequency ( 26.1 mhz ) carbon radio recombination line was detected in absorption towards the supernova remnant cas a by @xcite ( wrongly attributed to a hyperfine structure line of @xmath7 , @xcite ) .",
    "this line corresponds to a transition occurring at high quantum levels ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "recently , @xcite detected crrls in the range 25.526.5 mhz towards cas a , corresponding to transitions involving levels as large as @xmath9 .",
    "observations of low frequency carbon recombination lines can be used to probe the physical properties of the diffuse interstellar medium .",
    "however , detailed modeling is required to interpret the observations .",
    "@xcite showed that , at low temperatures ( @xmath10 ) , electrons can recombine with carbon ions by simultaneously exciting the @xmath11  fine structure line , a process known as dielectronic recombination - state accompanied by simultaneous excitation of the @xmath12 core electron to the excited @xmath13 state .",
    "the captured electron can either auto ionize , collisional transferred to another state , or radiatively decay .",
    "strictly speaking , dielectronic recombination refers to dieclectronic capture followed by stabilization .",
    "however , throughout this article we will use the term dielectronic recombination to refer to the same process as is common in the astronomical literature . ] .",
    "such recombination process occurs to high @xmath14 states , and can explain the behavior of the high @xmath14  crrls observed towards cas a. @xcite modified the code from @xcite to include dielectronic recombination .",
    "@xcite modified the code to consider transitions up to 10000 levels .",
    "all of these results assume a statistical distribution of the angular momentum levels , an assumption that is not valid at intermediate levels for low temperatures .",
    "moreover , the lower the temperature , the higher the @xmath14-level for which that assumption is not valid .    the increased sensitivity , spatial resolution , and bandwidth of the low frequency array ( lofar , @xcite ) is opening the low frequency sky to systematic studies of high quantum number radio recombination lines .",
    "the recent detection of high level carbon radio recombination lines using lofar towards the line of sight of cas a @xcite , cyg a @xcite , and the first extragalactic detection in the starburst galaxy m82 @xcite illustrate the potential of lofar for such studies .",
    "moreover , pilot studies have demonstrated that surveys of low frequency radio recombination lines of the galactic plane are within reach , providing a new and powerful probe of the diffuse interstellar medium .",
    "these new observations have motivated us to reassess some of the approximations made by previous works and to expand the range of applicability of recombination line theory in terms of physical parameters .",
    "in addition , increased computer power allows us to solve the level population problem considering a much larger number of levels than ever before .",
    "furthermore , updated collisional rates are now available @xcite , allowing us to explicitly consider the level population of quantum angular momentum sub - levels to high principal quantum number levels .",
    "finally , it can be expected that the square kilometer array , ska , will further revolutionize our understanding of the low frequency universe with even higher sensitivity and angular resolution @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we present the method to calculate the level population of recombining ions and provide some exemplary results applicable to low temperature diffuse clouds in the ism . in an accompanying article ( @xcite , from here on paper ii ) , we will present results specifically geared towards radio recombination line studies of the diffuse interstellar medium . in section  [ section_method ] , we introduce the problem of level populations of atoms and the methods to solve this problem for hydrogen and hydrogenic carbon atoms .",

    ", we discuss our results focusing on hydrogen and carbon atoms .",
    "we compare our results in terms of the departure coefficients with previous results from the literature . in section  [ section_conclusions ] , we summarize our results and provide the conclusions of the present work .",
    "a large fraction of our understanding of the physical processes in the universe comes from observations of atomic lines in astrophysical plasmas . in order to interpret the observations , accurate models for the level population of atoms",
    "are needed as the strength ( or depth ) of an emission ( absorption ) line depends on the level populations of atoms . here ,",
    "we summarize the basic ingredients needed to build level population models and provide a basic description of the level population problem .",

    "our results in figures  [ fig_compps ] and [ fig_compps2 ] show a pronounced bump for low @xmath14 in the range 50 to 150 .",
    "this bump is similar to what we see for the hydrogenic approximation but enhanced by dielectronic recombination ( c.f .",
    "figures 3.6 and 8 ; section 3.1.2 ) .",
    "as discussed in section 3.1.1 this bump arises at these intermediate @xmath14 levels because collisions compete with spontaneous decay , effectively storing electrons in high @xmath35 sublevels for which radiative decay is less important .",
    "this means that the inclusion of @xmath35-changing collisions leads to significantly larger @xmath183 values for @xmath14 in the range 50 to 150 as compared to @xcite .",
    "regardless of the @xmath35-changing collision rates used , at higher @xmath14 we note that our @xmath42 values with increasing @xmath14 asymptotically approach unity much faster than @xcite .",
    "this is especially true for lower electron densities ( @xmath1911.0  @xmath192 ) and a direct consequence of using the @xmath49-method to compute the departure coefficients .",
    "although the detailed behavior of our @xmath183 values differs strongly from @xcite there are also similarities in the general trends that we observe as a function of electron density and temperature . in particular , the very low and very high @xmath14 asymptotic behavior of the @xmath183 values is similar to @xcite in that the highest electron densities for a given electron temperature have the lowest @xmath183 values at low @xmath14 and approach equilibrium ( @xmath42=1 ) the fastest with increasing @xmath14 . for higher electron densities and lower electron temperatures , our results become increasingly similar to the hydrogenic case and agree with @xcite .",
    "this is expected as , as discussed in section 3.1 at high densities the @xmath42 values approach equilibrium .    in terms of @xmath180",
    "our results show , as expected , good agreement with the hydrogenic case and @xcite in the high density and low temperature limit .",
    "however , for the lower densities and higher temperatures shown in figures  [ fig_compps ] and [ fig_compps2 ] our models predict @xmath180 values that are lower by up to about an order of magnitude as compared to @xcite .",
    "this is particularly striking for the @xmath27=100  k and @xmath193=0.05  @xmath192 model shown in figure  [ fig_compps2 ] where we find that both the maximum negative @xmath180 value and maximum positive @xmath180 value are more than an order of magnitude lower than the corresponding @xcite values .",
    "since the integrated optical depth is directly proportional to the value of @xmath180 ( e.g. @xcite ) we can interpret @xmath180 as a stimulation factor .",
    "this means that , for a given set of physical conditions , our models predict much lower maximum integrated optical depths for carbon as compared to earlier investigations ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this is true for both emission ( negative @xmath180 ) and absorption ( positive @xmath180 ) .",
    "in particular , our models predict that equilibrium will be reached at much lower @xmath14 ( typically around @xmath194 ) and thus that the integrated optical at high @xmath14 ( low frequencies ) will show a rather flat behavior for @xmath195600 whereas the previous models by @xcite and @xcite predict a strong increase with increasing @xmath14 .",
    "we find that although our @xmath42 values asymptotically approach equilibrium at high @xmath14 that this value is not yet reached at @xmath196 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath180 values we find are nearly , but not yet completely , constant in the range @xmath197600 - 1000 and as such the dependence of integrated optical depth on @xmath180 remains important at high @xmath14 .",
    "finally , we note that for sufficiently high electron temperatures and low electron densities our models predict the existence of a region at intermediate @xmath14 ( @xmath197100 - 200 ) where the @xmath180 values can become positive . this behavior is a direct consequence of the inclusion of @xmath35-changing collisions in our models .",
    "a more detailed comparison of the departure coefficients obtained using the @xmath35-changing collision from @xcite and those using the rates from @xcite ( figure [ fig_comppengelly ] ) reveals differences of less than 30% for the conditions of interest for crrl studies .",
    "apart from the @xmath35-changing collisions there are other potentially important differences between our models and those published by @xcite .",
    "@xcite do not provide the explicit values of the dielectronic recombination rates that they use .",
    "however , they refer back to @xcite for these rates and as we use the same formalism , we do not think that the dielectronic recombination rates are at the heart of the discrepancy . may have influenced their results .",
    "in addition , we note that we use somewhat different collision rates in our simulations .",
    "however , as illustrated in figure 13 and 14 , the exact collision rates have only limited influence on the @xmath42 values .",
    "rather , we suspect that the approximate way the statistical equilibrium equations are solved by @xcite may have influenced their results and that including @xmath35-changing collisions properly rather than adopting a statistical populations as did @xcite is key",
    ".    a further assessment of the effect of any uncertainty in the adopted dielectronic recombination rates on the final departure coefficients can be performed by arbitrarily multiplying the dielectronic recombination rate by a factor .",
    "we note that a dielectronic recombination rate a factor of 30% higher ( lower ) increases ( decreases ) the departure coefficients at low levels ( @xmath198 ) by 30% . at the higher levels of interest for the study of crrls , ( @xmath199 ) a factor of 30% on the dielectronic recombination rates",

    "<S> when comparing our results including dielectronic recombination we find differences which we ascribe to updates in the atomic physics ( e.g. , collision rates ) and to the approximate solution method of the statistical equilibrium equations adopted in previous studies . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison with observations is discussed in an accompanying article , as radiative transfer effects need to be considered . </S>"
