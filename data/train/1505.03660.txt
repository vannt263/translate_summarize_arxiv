    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are the most luminous electromagnetic explosions in the universe .",
    "the observed grb spectra are typically fit by an empirical smoothly - jointed broken power - law function , the so - called band function , characterized by a peak energy ( @xmath11 ) in the @xmath3 spectrum , which ranges from kevs to mevs ( band et al .",
    "1993 ; zhang et al .",
    "the physical origin of the @xmath11 and the band function spectrum is still subject to debate ( kumar & zhang 2015 for a recent review ) .",
    "one possibility is synchrotron radiation in internal shocks ( e.g. , mszros et al . 1994 ; daigne & mochkovitch 1998 ; daigne et al .",
    "2011 ) or in internal magnetic dissipation regions ( e.g. , zhang & yan 2011 ) .",
    "a recent development of this model suggests that if the emission region is far from the central engine , the predicted spectra mimic the observed band spectra ( uhm & zhang 2014 ) , and can well fit the data with comparable confidence level as the band function ( zhang et al .",
    "another scenario attributes the @xmath11 and band function to emission from a dissipative photosphere of the fireball ( e.g. , rees & mszros 2005 ; beloborodov 2010 ; lazzati & begelman 2010 ; lundman et al .",
    "these models invoke different compositions of grb jets ( e.g. , matter dominated fireballs vs. poynting - flux dominated jets ) . differentiating them from the data",
    "has profound implications in understanding the physical mechanisms of grbs .",
    "several important empirical correlations have been discovered with the grb data .",
    "these correlations not only give important clues to understand grb physics ( even though some correlations still lack straightforward theoretical interpretations ) , but also some of them have been used to constrain cosmological parameters ( e.g. , wang et al .",
    "2015 for a recent review ) .",
    "for example , amati et al .",
    "( 2002 ) found a tight correlation between the isotropic gamma - ray energy @xmath12 and the cosmological rest - frame peak energy @xmath13 .",
    "a similar correlation was found between the isotropic luminosity and @xmath2 , both among different bursts ( yonetoku et al . 2004 ) and within a same burst ( liang et al .",
    "ghirlanda et al . (",
    "2004 ) found a tighter relation by replacing @xmath12 with the geometrically - corrected energy of the grb jets .",
    "the initial lorentz factor ( @xmath0 ) is a crucial parameter to understand grb physics .",
    "liang et al . ( 2010 ) discovered a correlation between ( @xmath0 ) and @xmath12 ( see also ghirlanda et al .",
    "( 2012 ) showed that the isotropic luminosity ( @xmath1 ) is also correlated with @xmath0 .",
    "theoretically , the predicted @xmath2 not only depends on luminosity @xmath1 , but also depends on the bulk lorentz factor @xmath0 of the outflow ( see e.g. , table 1 of zhang & mszros 2002 for a summary ) .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to search for possible multi - variable correlation among @xmath2 , @xmath1 ( or @xmath12 ) and @xmath0 .",
    "some multi - variable correlations have been found for grbs ( e.g. , liang & zhang 2005 ; rossi et al .",
    "2008 ) , which are useful to understand grb physics .",
    "this paper presents a multiple - variable regression analysis among @xmath12 ( or @xmath1 ) , @xmath2 , and @xmath0 for long duration grbs .",
    "we compile a sample of long grbs whose @xmath12 ( or @xmath1 ) , @xmath2 , and @xmath0 can be derived from the observation data ( section 2 ) .",
    "several correlations among these quantities are presented in section 3 .",
    "physical implications are discussed in section 4 , and conclusions are drawn in section 5 .",
    "notation @xmath14 is adopted in cgs units .",
    "we compile a sample of grbs whose @xmath12 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath0 are available in the literature or can be calculated with observational data .",
    "@xmath2 can be obtained by the measured @xmath11 and redshift @xmath15 .",
    "both @xmath12 and @xmath1 are corrected to an energy band of @xmath16 kev in the burst rest frame .",
    "the lorentz factor @xmath0 is a key parameter in this analysis .",
    "three methods have been proposed to estimate @xmath0 of a grb fireball .",
    "the first one is to use a smooth onset bump observed in optical afterglow lightcurves . by interpreting this bump as a result of deceleration of the fireball by an ambient medium in the thin shell regime ( which is usually satisfied for a constant density medium )",
    ", one can estimate @xmath0 with the peak time of the bump ( mszros & rees 1993 ; sari & piran 1999 ; zhang et al .",
    "2003 ; molinari et al .",
    "the second method is based on the  compactness \" argument by interpreting the high energy cutoff of the prompt gamma - ray spectrum as pair production signature ( e.g. , baring & harding 1997 ; lithwick & sari 2001 ; gupta & zhang 2008 ) .",
    "the third approach is to use a blackbody component detected in the spectra of some grbs ( e.g. , peer et al .",
    "2007 ; peng et al . 2014 ; zou et al . 2015 ) .",
    "this method is based on the assumption of a matter - dominated fireball , and therefore is not reliable if the central engine carries a significant fraction of poynting flux ( gao & zhang 2015 ) .",
    "the first method gives the most robust estimates to @xmath0 , since the deceleration time weaklier depends on other model parameters than @xmath0 .",
    "such afterglow onset feature is observed in about 1/3 of grbs with early optical afterglow observations ( li et al .",
    "although the `` onset afterglow '' feature in some x - ray and gev lightcurves is also observed ( xue et al .",
    "2009 ; ghisellini et al .",
    "2010 ) , early x - ray emission and gev emission may have contamination from internal emission components .",
    "thus , we only include grbs with an onset bump detected in the optical band ( most bursts from liang et al .",
    "2010 , 2013 and references therein ) .",
    "we calculate their @xmath0 values with the afterglow onset peaks assuming that the fireballs of these grbs are in an inter stellar medium with density profile @xmath17 @xmath18 and their radiation efficiencies are @xmath19 ( e.g. , liang et al .",
    "the only exception is the nearby low luminosity grb 060218 whose @xmath0 is robustly estimated from the radio data ( soderberg et al .",
    "the inclusion of this grb stretches the dynamical range of the correlations significantly .",
    "@xmath1 values are measured in the 1s peak time of their lightcurves , and @xmath12 values are calculated with their gamma - ray fluences .",
    "both @xmath1 and @xmath12 are corrected to @xmath20 kev band in the burst frame .",
    "their @xmath11 values are derived from the fits to their time - integrated spectra with the band function of time - integrated spectrum is usually consistent with that derived from the spectrum around the peak time ( lyu et al . 2015 ) . ] .",
    "altogether our sample includes 34 grbs , which are reported in table 1 .",
    "with the available data , we conduct both single and multiple variable regression analysis to look for correlations among the parameters @xmath12 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath0 .",
    "notice that the results depend on the specification of dependent and independent variables ( isobe et al .",
    "therefore , one may find discrepancy of the dependences among variables by specifying different dependent variables for a given data set , especially when the data have large error bars or large scatter . to avoid specifying independent and dependent variables in the best linear fits , in principle the algorithm of the bisector of two ordinary least - squares may be adopted .",
    "however , in connecting physical models , often some parameters ( e.g. , @xmath21 ) are believed to depend on other parameters ( e.g. , @xmath22 ) , see more discussion in section 4 .",
    "we therefore use the spearman correlation analysis to search for pair correlations among these parameters , and adopt the stepwise regression analysis method to perform a multiple regression analysis for multiple parameters by specifying a given @xmath21 .",
    "we measure the dispersion ( @xmath23 ) of a regression model with standard deviation of @xmath24 from @xmath21 , where @xmath25 marks the @xmath21 value derived from the regression model .",
    "figure 1 shows the pair correlations among @xmath12 , @xmath2 , and @xmath0 , or among @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath0 .",
    "they are derived in the logarithmic space , and the results are reported in table 2 .",
    "the regression lines together with their 2@xmath23 dispersion regions are also shown in figure 1 .",
    "correlations among @xmath12 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath0 are found , with a spearman correlation coefficient @xmath26 and chance probability @xmath27 .",
    "tight @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 correlations found in previous papers ( e.g. , amati et al .",
    "2002 ; liang et al . 2004",
    "; yonetoku et al .",
    "2004 ; liang et al . 2010 ; lu et al . 2012 ; l et al .",
    "2012 ) values .",
    "their method applies the blandford - mckee ( 1976 ) self - similar deceleration solution and extrapolates backwards to derive @xmath0 . ]",
    "are well confirmed . combining the @xmath32 ( or @xmath33 ) and the @xmath30 ( or @xmath34 ) correlations , one may suspect a correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath0 .",
    "such a correlation is indeed found in our sample , which is @xmath35 with a correlation coefficient of 0.63 .",
    "next , we explore the possible correlations among @xmath12 , @xmath2 , and @xmath0 , or among @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath0 , using the stepwise regression analysis method .",
    "our model is @xmath36 , where @xmath21 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 stand for the observables ( logarithmic ) .",
    "we measure the tightness of @xmath39 with the dispersion and linear coefficient of the pair correlation between @xmath39 and @xmath21 .",
    "our results are also reported in table 2 .",
    "interestingly , much tighter correlations are found in our multiple variable regression analysis from the variable set \\{@xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath0 } than the pair correlations involving @xmath1 .",
    "the dispersions of the @xmath33 and @xmath34 pair correlations are 0.56 and 0.67 , and their linear coefficients are 0.89 and 0.84 , respectively . the dispersion of the relation @xmath40 is reduced to 0.33 and the linear coefficient increases to 0.96 .",
    "figure 2 shows @xmath39 as a function of @xmath21 for the multi - variable correlations derived from the variable set \\{@xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath0}.    the multi - variable correlations derived from the variable set \\{@xmath12 , @xmath2 , @xmath0 } are less significantly improved over the pair correlations involving @xmath12 .",
    "the dispersions of the @xmath32 and @xmath30 pair correlations are 0.57 and 0.63 , and their linear coefficients are 0.83 and 0.77 , respectively .",
    "the dispersion of the @xmath41 relation is reduced to 0.41 and the linear coefficient is slightly increased to 0.88 .",
    "we also show @xmath41 as a function of @xmath12 in figure 2",
    ". however , the dependence between @xmath2 and @xmath0 in the relations of @xmath42 and @xmath43 is negligible .",
    "this could be due to the large dispersion of the @xmath44 dependence in the current sample .",
    "our analysis shows that the dispersions of the @xmath33 and @xmath32 pair correlations are comparable .",
    "nava et al . ( 2012 ) reported that the @xmath33 correlation has slightly larger scatter than the @xmath32 correlation .",
    "this would be due to the variation of small sub - samples used for analysis .",
    "note that @xmath12 is a time - integrated quantity .",
    "@xmath11 usually evolves significantly within a grb and even within a grb pulse ( e.g. , lu et al .",
    "the @xmath45 of time - integrated spectrum is usually consistent with that derived from the spectrum around the peak time ( lyu et al . 2015 ) .",
    "therefore , the time - integrated effect of @xmath12 would result in significant scatter to the @xmath32 correlation .",
    "it was suggested that the @xmath33 correlation may be the basis of the time - integrated @xmath32 correlation ( lu et al .",
    "2012 ; lyu et al .",
    "2015 ) is calculated is often not homogeneous in the cosmological rest - frame .",
    "this would make extra scatters to the @xmath33 correlation . ] .",
    "the 3-parameter correlations involving @xmath0 improve significantly when using @xmath1 .",
    "this may be due to the fact that @xmath1 has a double dependence on @xmath0 ( both photon energy and time ) , but @xmath12 only has a dependence on @xmath0 for photon energy .",
    "we focus on the \\{@xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath0 } correlation in our following analysis .",
    "this correlation takes three forms , but two forms are of theoretical interest in the grb physics ( e.g. , zhang & mszros 2002 ) and grb cosmology ( e.g. , dai et al .",
    "2004 ) .    first , in terms of @xmath1",
    ", it can be expressed as @xmath46 with a correlation coefficient of 0.96 and a dispersion of @xmath47 dex . by adding @xmath0 ,",
    "this relation is tighter than the @xmath33 ( yonetoku ) relation and @xmath32 ( amati ) relation .",
    "it suggests that the relatively large dispersion in the yonetoku - relation and amati - relation is likely due to the lack of consideration of the role of @xmath0 , a key parameter for the relativistic outflows of grbs .",
    "the second format of the correlation is expressed in terms of @xmath2 , which reads @xmath48 with a correlation coefficient of 0.92 and a dispersion of @xmath49 .",
    "this format more directly carries a physical meaning , which we discuss in the next section .",
    "our analysis is based on the grbs whose @xmath0 are measured with the deceleration peak time in the afterglow lightcurves , except for grb 060218 .",
    "this method is the most robust one to estimate @xmath0 . for a self - consistency check",
    ", we also introduce other grbs whose @xmath0 are derived from other methods .",
    "for example , tang et al . (",
    "2015 ) systematically searched for the high energy spectral cutoffs from the joint lat / gbm observations of grbs and estimated @xmath0 for 9 grbs using the opacity argument .",
    "they are consistent with the derived @xmath50 correlation , as shown in figure 2 .    with the measured @xmath0 for the grbs in our sample , we further investigate the possible correlations among @xmath51 ( or @xmath52 ) , @xmath53 , and @xmath0 in the jet - comoving frame ( e.g. , ghirlanda et al .",
    "2013 ) , where @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 .",
    "our regression analysis results are reported in table 3 .",
    "it is found that the pair correlations are much weaker than those among @xmath1 ( or @xmath12 ) , @xmath2 , and @xmath0 and their chance probabilities are larger than @xmath57 .",
    "these results suggest that the observed pair correlations are likely governed by the doppler boosting effect .",
    "the three - parameter regressions show that the @xmath58 relation still exists , as shown in figure 3 .",
    "the difference between the @xmath58 and the @xmath59 relations is the index of @xmath0 .",
    "this is reasonable since @xmath51 and @xmath53 are corrected by the @xmath0 factor .",
    "note that grb 060218 is peculiar with extremely low @xmath1 , @xmath11 , and @xmath0 in comparison with the typical grbs in our sample relation and the spectral lag-@xmath1 relation of typical grbs ( amati et al .",
    "2007 ; liang et al . 2006 ) . ] .",
    "the inclusion of this event significantly expands the dynamical range of the correlations discussed above . excluding this event",
    ", we find that the @xmath59 relation still holds , showing as @xmath60 and @xmath61 . within error bars ,",
    "the indices are consistent with that derived from our grb 060218-included sample .",
    "this indicates that the @xmath59 relation is not from broad ranges being due to this peculiar event .",
    "we also make correlation analysis among @xmath51 ( or @xmath52 ) , @xmath53 , and @xmath0 by excluding grb 060218 from our sample .",
    "the results are reported in table 4 .",
    "one can find that the @xmath62 relation still exists ( see figure 3 ) , but the indices of @xmath0 are getting smaller and have a larger uncertainty than that in the @xmath59 relation .",
    "it is also interesting that an @xmath7 relation is found for typical grbs , i.e. , @xmath63 ) with a spearman linear correlation coefficient of 0.85 and chance probability @xmath27 , but grb 060218 deviates from this relation at a 3 @xmath23 confidence level ( figure 3 ) .",
    "this may hint that the radiation physics of this event may be different from typical grbs ( e.g. , campana et al .",
    "2006 ; wang et al . 2007 ) .",
    "different grb prompt emission models have different predictions of the rest - frame peak energy @xmath2 .",
    "zhang & mszros ( 2002 ) summarized these predictions in their table 1 .",
    "in general , @xmath2 is not only a function of the outflow luminosity @xmath64 , which may be proportional to the observed luminosity @xmath65 , but also depends on @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath2 predictions of different models have different indices on @xmath64 and @xmath0 . with the available correlation ( eq . [ ep_model ] )",
    ", one can place strong constraints on various models .",
    "an immediate inference from table 1 of zhang & mszros ( 2002 ) is that the predicted @xmath2 of the simplest baryonic photosphere models ( called `` innermost model '' in the paper ) and the external shock models all have wrong dependence on both @xmath64 and @xmath0 .",
    "the external shock model is now essentially ruled out with the _ swift _ early x - ray afterglow data that show a steep decay phase ( see zhang et al .",
    "2006 for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "for the photosphere model , one has @xmath66 ( central engine temperature ) @xmath67 if the photosphere radius @xmath68 is below the coasting radius @xmath69 .",
    "there is no @xmath0-dependence in this regime , which is not supported by the data . when @xmath70 , one has @xmath71 ( zhang & mszros 2002 ) , where @xmath72 is the wind luminosity",
    "this apparently conflicts with the observations . noticing that the photosphere luminosity scales as @xmath73 , one gets @xmath74 .",
    "this gives @xmath75 which violates the observations badly .",
    "noticing @xmath76 , one again derives eq.([eq : ep - ph ] ) . ] .",
    "for dissipative photospheres , @xmath2 may be different from the photosphere temperature estimated above .",
    "however , there is no straightforward physics to drive @xmath2 to satisfy eq.([ep_model ] ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that the data do not favor the photosphere models of grb prompt emission .",
    "a favorable model is synchrotron radiation in an internal emission region ( internal shocks , mszros et al .",
    "1994 ; or an internal magnetic dissipation site , zhang & yan 2011 ) . within this model ,",
    "one can generally write ( zhang & mszros 2002 ) @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the radius of the emission region from the central engine .",
    "one can see that the 1/2 index for @xmath64 match eq.([ep_model ] ) , which suggests that synchrotron radiation is likely the right emission mechanism . if the outflow is not magnetized , the emission radius is the internal shock radius , i.e. @xmath79 . from eq.([ep - syn ] ) one gets @xmath80 .",
    "the index for @xmath0 is too steep ( -2 ) compared with the data ( @xmath81 ) ( eq.[ep_model ] ) .",
    "this suggests that there must be another factor that moderates @xmath78 to have a shallower dependence on @xmath0 .",
    "if the outflow is poynting - flux - dominated , so that synchrotron emission comes from the icmart ( internal - collision - induced magnetic reconnection and turbulence ) region , then the predicted @xmath2 has an extra dependence on @xmath23 , i.e. ( eq .",
    "58 of zhang & yan 2011 ) @xmath82 this extra dependence can make it possible to interpret the observed correlation .",
    "in particular , the data demand @xmath83 .",
    "zhang & yan ( 2011 ) argued that a larger @xmath23 tends to increase @xmath78 , since more collisions are required to finally reach the critical point for icmart discharge , so that @xmath84 should have a shallower @xmath0 dependence than @xmath85 . even though more detailed numerical modeling is needed to reveal the nature of our correlation ( [ ep_model ] ) , this qualitative picture seems to be consistent with the data .",
    "we presented a multiple linear regression analysis to key observables of the grb outflows , i.e. , @xmath1 ( @xmath12 ) , @xmath2 , and @xmath0 .",
    "the analysis of pair correlations among these observables well confirms several previously reported correlations .",
    "most interestingly , we find a new tight correlation among @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath0 from our multiple regression analysis .",
    "we argue that this tight @xmath50 correlation is more physical than the @xmath33 and @xmath34 correlations , and it may be directly related to both radiation physics and bulk motion of the outflows .",
    "the tight @xmath86 correlation sheds light into the origin of grb prompt emission .",
    "we show that the photosphere models have difficulties to account for the correlation , and synchrotron radiation is likely the radiation mechanism of grb prompt emission .",
    "this is consistent with other independent arguments in favor of synchrotron radiation ( zhang et al . 2013 ; wang et al . 2014 ; uhm & zhang 2014 ; zhang et al .",
    "2015 ) . within the synchrotron model ,",
    "the internal shock model predicts a too steep dependence on @xmath0 , and hence , not favored . the icmart magnetic dissipation model ( zhang & yan 2011 ) has the general merit to account for the correlation , even though no quantitative proof to the correlation is available .",
