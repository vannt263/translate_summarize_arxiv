    "experiments on virtual compton scattering ( vcs ) and deeply - virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) are an important part of nucleon structure studies at major electron - scattering laboratories , and at jefferson lab in particular @xcite .",
    "the reason for such a high interest is that vcs allows to access 3-dimensional parton distributions of a nucleon and has a potential of resolving the role of parton orbital angular momentum in the nucleon spin problem , see the original papers @xcite and recent reviews @xcite .    in experimental observations ,",
    "the vcs amplitude of electroproduction of real photons competes with a large and often dominant bethe - heitler ( bh ) amplitude , in which the real photon is emitted by leptons in the scattering process . in the leading order in electromagnetic interactions , single - spin asymmetries ( ssa ) in electroproduction of real photons",
    "are caused only by the vcs amplitude , including its interference with bh process .",
    "bh amplitude alone does not lead to ssa , unless higher - order electromagnetic corrections are included . here",
    "we present a calculation of ssa coming from such corrections .",
    "the fact that qed loop radiative corrections can induce the beam ssa in @xmath1 and @xmath2 collisions with production of a @xmath3-pair or radiation of a photon is known for a long time . a spin - momentum correlation in differential cross sections for these processes",
    "were first considered by olsen and maximon in 1959 @xcite , and somewhat later in other publications @xcite .",
    "it was shown that a large azimuthal asymmetry originates from interference of the first and second ( two  photon exchange ) born approximation .",
    "these studies addressed primarily the case of low energies , such that @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the energy of the incoming polarized particle and @xmath6 is the target mass .",
    "more recently it was pointed out , for example , in ref.@xcite that ssa can be induced also by a pure loop correction to the lepton part of the interaction . for the related processes of radiative mller scattering and electron - positron pair production on an electron target , the calculation of ref.@xcite yields substantial ssa , reaching tens of per cent in selected kinematics .",
    "asymmetries of this magnitude could present a significant systematic correction to vcs studies , and this fact partly motivated our present calculation spanning a broad kinematic range .",
    "in ref.@xcite the corresponding effect is included in the full radiative correction to beam ssa due to interference between bh and ( the absorptive part of ) nucleon vcs amplitudes . in ref.@xcite the full correction to the beam ssa",
    "was computed numerically , but up to now there is no published analytic expressions for the beam ssa caused by the loop correction to the leptonic tensor , that is simple enough to include in monte carlo generators for analysis of vcs experiments .",
    "the present paper aims at closing this gap .",
    "in addition , using an unpolarized leptonic compton tensor originally derived in ref.@xcite , we obtain new results for ssa in the bh process with a polarized proton target arising from qed loop corrections .",
    "the qed effects considered in this paper are referred to as model - independent , since they do not require additional knowledge of the nucleon structure .",
    "they represent systematic corrections to ssa measurements such as @xcite in the interference region between bh and vcs amplitudes of electroproduction of real photons .",
    "the contribution to the beam ssa for the bh process , @xmath7 induced by one  loop corrections to the leptonic part of interaction in the case of longitudinally polarized incoming electrons can be written in terms of contraction of the leptonic and hadronic tensors @xmath8}{b_{\\mu\\nu}h_{\\mu\\nu}}\\   , \\ ] ] where the symbol @xmath9 denotes the real part and @xmath10 is an unpolarized leptonic tensor for large - angle photon emission in the process ( 1 ) . we define it as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the electron mass .",
    "note that both mandelstam invariants ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) in experiments that study proton vcs @xcite are large , therefore in our calculations we can omit the lepton mass in the quantity @xmath10 and write the latter in the form @xmath15 where the tilde notation for 4-vectors denotes the gauge - invariant substitution , @xmath16 .        for the hadronic tensor",
    ", we use its born expression @xmath17 where @xmath18 are the dirac and pauli proton form factors , respectively , and @xmath19 is a 4vector of proton polarization . the expressions for spin  independent and spin  dependent parts of the hadronic tensor are @xmath20 \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 and the sign convention for the levi - civita tensor is @xmath22 only the spin - independent hadronic tensor contributes to the beam ssa , therefore contraction of the tensors reads @xmath23+\\nonumber \\\\ & & \\frac{2\\delta^2}{st}\\big(f_1 ^ 2-\\frac{\\delta^2}{4m^2}f_2 ^ 2\\big)\\big[v^2+x^2+v(u+t ) -x(u+s)\\big]\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 .",
    "let us now consider the leptonic tensor .",
    "in general , its spin - dependent part for the case of the beam longitudinal polarization can be written as @xmath25 where the born value @xmath26 is pure imaginary and antisymmetric and therefore it does not contribute in the beam ssa , whereas the one - loop correction to it @xmath27 , together with the imaginary antisymmetric part , contains also the the real and symmetric part .",
    "the latter is caused by interference between the born - level bh amplitude and the diagrams in fig.[diagrams ] with an additional photon loop and an external photon coupling to the outgoing electron .",
    "these diagrams produce a nonzero imaginary ( absorptive ) part of the amplitude in the physical region of the process ( 1 ) due to two - particle electron - photon intermediate states as shown in fig.[diagrams ] by the unitarity cuts .",
    "calculation of the one - loop diagrams of fig.[diagrams ] contributing to the radiative leptonic tensor can be done by standard qed techniques .",
    "details of the calculation can be found in ref.@xcite for unpolarized electrons and in ref.@xcite for longitudinally polarized electrons . in calculations of ssa , we are only concerned with the absorptive parts of the electron virtual compton amplitude that enters the radiative leptonic tensor . it should be noted that calculation of ssa is infra - red safe , _",
    "i.e. _ , infra - red singularities explicitly cancel at the loop level for this observable .",
    "it is an important consistency check of the calculation , since ultra - soft photon radiation that normally cancels such singularities has zero absorptive part and therefore can not assist with infra - red divergence cancellation in the considered observable .    the contribution to @xmath27 we are interested in can be derived by standard loop computation techniques of qed . neglecting terms that are explicitly anti - symmetric in indices @xmath28",
    ", we arrive at the following expression ( @xmath29 eq.(36 ) of ref.@xcite ) , @xmath30-i(k_1 k_2 \\delta \\mu ) [ b^*_1 \\tilde{k}_{1\\nu}+b^*_2 \\tilde{k}_{2\\nu}]\\ , \\ ] ] where the quantity @xmath31 has the form @xmath32\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , except for the 4-vector @xmath33 , we used the same notation as in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , @xmath34 the quantities @xmath35 and @xmath36 can be derived from @xmath31 and @xmath37 by substitution @xmath38    imaginary parts of @xmath31 and @xmath35 which induce the real symmetric part of @xmath27 can arise from the terms containing @xmath39 and @xmath40 and the terms contributing to the imaginary part of @xmath36 are @xmath39 and @xmath41 because of the condition @xmath42 from the form of proparators in the feynman diagrams of fig.[diagrams ] it follows that to obtain the imaginary part of @xmath31 and @xmath35 , one has to add a small negative imaginary part to the electron mass .",
    "it leads to @xmath43 and it means that @xmath44 where the symbol @xmath45 stands for the imaginary part . by combining the previous results , we arrive at @xmath46,\\\\ \\bar{b}_2&=&\\frac{2\\delta^2}{t}\\bigl[\\frac{t-2u}{t+u}-2(1-\\frac{u}{t})\\ln(1+\\frac{t}{u})\\bigr ] \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note",
    "that the terms containing anomalous poles at @xmath47 are cancelled explicitly in eqs .",
    "( [ 9 ] ) .",
    "moreover , both @xmath48 and @xmath49 are proportional to @xmath14 if @xmath50 .",

    "it can be seen from fig.2 that the asymmetry is rather small , not exceeding 0.1 per cent in the kinematics of the considered experiments , even for a rather broad range of variable @xmath65 .",

    "our calculations indicate that beam and target ssa generated by loop corrections to leptonic part of the interaction in the bh process are small and for the considered experimental conditions they do not exceed 0.1 per cent .",
    "the reason is that in addition to being multiplied by the fine structure constant @xmath98 , they contain additional suppression for the relevant values of kinematic invariants .",
    "in conclusion , let us discuss the role of other radiative corrections in the bh process coming from real - photon radiation . in vcs experiments ,",
    "the kinematic cuts are imposed in such a way that the phase space of the ( undetected ) additional photon is restricted to its relatively small values . in this case , the main contribution to the radiative correction comes from spin - independent soft photon emission that does not affect polarization observables , but does change unpolarized cross sections by as much as about 20 per cent ( see , e.g. , @xcite for vcs case and ref.@xcite for elastic electron - proton scattering ) .",
    "therefore in such a soft - photon - emission regime , the loop correction considered here is _ the only _ model - independent radiative correction to ssa .",
    "thus , we demonstrated that systematic corrections to beam and target ssa arising from the higher - order qed effects in the bh process are negligible compared to the relatively large ( tens of per cent ) experimentally observed asymmetries @xcite due to interference between the bh and vcs amplitudes in electroproduction of real photons .",
    "we confirm that the basic assumption of negligible ssa from the bh process alone holds to better than 0.1 per cent accuracy , thereby justifying present interpretation of ssa as arising mainly from the bh - vcs interference and vcs mechanisms .",
