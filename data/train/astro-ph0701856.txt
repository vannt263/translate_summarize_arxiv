    "it is well known that the interaction of cosmic ray ( cr ) nuclei with the interstellar medium ( ism ) should give rise to diffuse @xmath0-ray and neutrino emissions @xcite .",
    "several satellites ( see @xcite for a review ) , especially egret @xcite , already observed the @xmath0-ray diffuse emission of the galaxy up to @xmath2 . around the gev , the hadronic origin of a large fraction of that emission",
    "is testified by its good correlation with the distribution of the interstellar hydrogen .",
    "glast observatory @xcite should soon provide a deeper insight into the nature of that emission as it will probe the @xmath0-ray sky with much better sensitivity and angular resolution than egret and extend the explored energy window up to 300 gev . above that energy ,",
    "however , satellite observatories can hardly provide significant data .",
    "ground based experiments are divided in two main groups : extensive air shower arrays and atmospheric cherenkov telescopes . in the former class , experiments like milagro @xcite and tibet @xcite can probe large regions of the sky at energies larger than few tev s with an angular resolution of several degrees .",
    "those experiments already provided interesting constraints on the diffuse emission from the galactic disk @xcite and , in the case of milagro , a diffuse emission from the cygnus region has been recently observed @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , none of those experiments covers a sky window encompassing the galactic centre ( gc ) .",
    "atmospheric cherenkov telescopes , like hess @xcite and magic @xcite , are sensitive to @xmath0-rays with energy in the range @xmath3 and have a very good angular resolution ( better than @xmath4 ) . however , although these instruments can search for a diffuse emission in some limited regions of the sky , they are mainly dedicated to observe quite localised sources .",
    "neutrino telescopes ( nts ) may soon provide a new valuable probe of high energy cr physics which can be complementary to @xmath0-ray observatories . the large detection volume , large field of view , available observation time , and relatively good angular resolution ( which should be better than @xmath5 for water cherenkov nts looking for up - going muon neutrinos ) make , at least in principle , these instruments well suited to search for the diffuse neutrino emission of the galaxy .",
    "+ the amanda telescope , which is operating at the south pole , put already an upper limit on the @xmath6 s flux from the gp @xcite ( see ) and icecube @xcite should significantly improve that limit .",
    "however , in this context the most promising nts are those based in the north hemisphere ( antares @xcite , nemo @xcite and nestor @xcite and especially their planned @xmath7 upgrade , the km3net project @xcite ) as they will be sensitive to up - going @xmath6 s coming from the gc region .",
    "furthermore , since these instruments will be deployed in water , their angular resolution should be better than nt at the south pole improving their chances to disentangle the signal from the background .    from the theoretical point of view , several calculations of the @xmath0-ray and neutrino diffuse fluxes above the tev have been already performed . in @xcite",
    "the cr distribution in the galactic disk was assumed to be homogeneous so that the secondary @xmath8 and @xmath0-ray fluxes come out to be proportional to the gas column density ( in @xcite a uniform gas distribution was assumed ) . while that was a very reasonable approximation to start with ,",
    "a more accurate analysis should account for the inhomogeneous cr distribution which arises due to the not uniform scatter of sources .",
    "it should be noted that , since cr sources are likely to be related to supernova remnants ( snr ) and those objects are most abundant in the gas ( target ) rich regions , the secondary @xmath0-ray and neutrino emissions may be significantly enhanced with respect to the case in which a uniform cr distribution is assumed .",
    "the cr homogeneity assumption was released in more recent works where the high energy nuclei distribution was modelled by solving the spatial diffusion equation @xcite .",
    "those papers , however , were mainly addressed to model the diffuse @xmath0-ray emission below the tev and did not consider neutrinos . in",
    "@xcite a different , and promising , approach was considered to solve the diffusion equation and to model the neutrino emission up to the pev . in that paper , however , several approximations were done which did not allow to reach an angular accuracy better than @xmath9 .",
    "the aim of this work is to model both the diffuse @xmath0-ray and neutrino emissions of the galaxy above the tev with a better accuracy .",
    "that is necessary in order to be able to establish the detection perspectives of air shower arrays and neutrino telescopes and to interpret correctly forthcoming observations .",
    "our approach is comprehensive as we carefully account both for the spatial distribution of cr nuclei and for that of the ism .    in",
    "we start by discussing the main properties of the ism .",
    "we pay special attention to the distribution of snr ( see ) and to that of the atomic and molecular hydrogen ( ) . in both cases we adopt models which we apply for the first time in this context .",
    "details of gas models and their comparison with those adopted in previous works are given in the [ sec : appendix_gas ] .",
    "in we model the distribution of the cr nuclei in the galaxy by solving numerically the diffusion equation .",
    "our approach is similar to that sketched in @xcite that we fully exploit here . differently from @xcite",
    "we use expressions for the diffusion coefficients as determined from montecarlo simulations of charged particle propagation in turbulent magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "this allows us to get more detailed cr distributions above the tev and to test how much the large uncertainties in the knowledge of the turbulent component of the gmf ( see ) affect our predictions . in we combine the simulated cr distributions and the gas models to map the expected @xmath6 and @xmath0-ray emissions .",
    "then , in we compare our predictions with available experimental results . in",
    "we briefly discuss the perspectives that a @xmath10 nt to be built in the mediterranean sea has to detect the muon neutrino emission from the inner galaxy .",
    "finally , in we summarise our conclusions .",
    "in order to assess the problem of the propagation of crs and their interaction with the ism we need the knowledge of three basic physical inputs , namely :    1 .",
    "the distribution of supernova remnants ( snr ) which we assume to trace that of cr sources ; 2 .",
    "the properties of the galactic magnetic field ( gmf ) in which the propagation occurs ; 3 .   the distribution of the diffuse gas providing the target for the production of @xmath0-rays and neutrinos through hadronic interactions .",
    "since all these inputs are affected by large uncertainties and systematics , we need to estimate how their poor knowledge is transferred in the resulting @xmath0-ray and @xmath8 emission .",
    "therefore , we compare the results obtained using several models . in the following",
    "we assume cylindrical symmetry and adopt the sun galactocentric distance @xmath11 .",
    "the rate of galactic sn explosions , as inferred from observations of sn in external galaxies similar to the milky way @xcite , is roughly @xmath12 respectively for type i and type ii sn .",
    "the total rate is @xmath13 which is in reasonably good agreement with records of historical sn .",
    "since we will normalise the cr injection rate by requiring the simulated cr flux to meet the observed value at earth position , we are only interested in the @xmath14 and @xmath15 ratio .",
    "what is even more crucial to our analysis is the _ spatial distribution _ of type i and ii sn . since type - ia and core - collapsed sn originate from different stellar populations their spatial distribution , as well as their rate , are different .",
    "several methods to determined the snr distribution in the galaxy are discussed in the literature .",
    "one of the most commonly adopted methods is that to estimate the snr distances on the basis of the surface brightness - distance ( @xmath16 ) relation @xcite .",
    "such an analysis does not cover the gc region .",
    "furthermore , several doubts have been risen on the accuracy of that method as it is plagued by a number of systematics concerning the completeness of the available snr catalogue and the proper handling of selection effects @xcite .",
    "here we adopt a snr distribution a distribution which is inferred from observations of related objects , such as pulsars or progenitor stars , as done e.g. in @xcite which , in our opinion , is a safer approach .    in @xcite the spatial distribution of type - ia snr",
    "adopted was assumed to follow that of old disk stars which have an exponential scale length @xmath17 along @xmath18 and an exponential scale height @xmath19 . therefore @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a normalisation factor .",
    "although type - ia sn are globally less frequent than core - collapsed sn , their rate is dominating in the inner few kpc s of the galaxy .    to trace core - collapsed",
    "originated snr one may use either hii regions , which are produced by their luminous progenitors , or pulsars , which are a likely left - over of the collapse .",
    "the pulsar distribution at birth was estimated to be @xcite @xmath22 \\ ,   & r < 3.7 \\ { \\rm kpc } \\nonumber   \\\\ \\noalign{\\medskip } \\exp \\left [ - { \\displaystyle r^2 - r_\\odot^2                   \\over                   \\displaystyle ( 6.8 \\ { \\rm kpc})^2 } \\right ] \\ ,   & r > 3.7 \\ { \\rm kpc } \\end{array } \\right . \\label{snr2}\\ ] ] where @xmath23   + 0.21 \\",
    "\\exp \\left [ - \\left ( { z \\over 0.6 \\ { { { \\rm kpc } } } } \\right)^2 \\right]~.\\ ] ] while the absolute values of @xmath24 and @xmath25 are irrelevant here , their ratio is needed to normalise the relative weights of type - i and type - ii snr distributions . by requiring that @xmath26 , as it follows from ( [ i - ii - rates ] ) , we find @xmath27 .    in",
    "we show the total snr radial distribution as obtained in that way and compare it with that given in @xcite .",
    "both distributions have been normalised so to take the same value at the solar circle where observations are most reliable .",
    "it is evident that in the inner galaxy the snr rate distribution which we adopt in this work , is significantly higher than that given in @xcite .",
    "rather , we have a relative good agreement with the distribution adopted in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) which is based on pulsars , and with independent observations of the @xmath28 line of @xmath29al which is thought to be a reliable tracer of sns @xcite .",
    "is shown in arbitrary units versus the distance from the gc .",
    "the distribution is such that , in cylindrical symmetry , @xmath30 represents the total sn rate in the whole galaxy .",
    "the upper line ( red , continue ) is that derived in @xcite which we adopt here , while the lower one ( blue , dashed ) is from @xcite .",
    "they are both normalised to unit at @xmath31 . ]",
    "we assume the spatial distribution of the cr sources to coincide with that of snrs and the cr energy spectrum at source to be everywhere a power - law with exponent @xmath32 ( @xmath32 , which refers to the injection spectrum , should not be confused with the slope of the observed cr spectrum ) .",
    "therefore , the source term in our diffusion equation will be @xmath33 its absolute normalisation @xmath34 and spectral slope @xmath32 will be fixed so to reproduce the observed spectrum at earth below the knee .",
    "for protons @xcite @xmath35      the milky way , as well as other spiral galaxies , is known to be permeated by large - scale , so called _ regular _ , magnetic fields .",
    "the orientation and strength of those fields is measured mainly by means of faraday rotation measurements ( rms ) of polarised radio sources . from those observations",
    "it is known that the regular field in the disk of the galaxy is prevalently oriented along the disk plane and it seems to follow the galactic arms as observed in other spiral galaxies .",
    "according to @xcite , its strength at the sun position is @xmath36 while at smaller radii @xmath37 where @xmath38 .",
    "a @xmath39 profile seems to give a worst fit of data .",
    "unfortunately , observations are not significant for @xmath40 .",
    "most likely @xcite the regular field in the disk has a bi - symmetric structure ( bbs ) with a counterclockwise field in the spiral arms and clockwise in the interarm regions .",
    "concerning its vertical behaviour , it is generally assumed that @xmath41 decreases exponentially for increasing values of @xmath42 with a scale height of few hundred parsecs .",
    "there are increasing evidences that the field is symmetric for @xmath43 ( bbs - s ) @xcite .",
    "superimposed to the regular field a random , or turbulent , component of the gmf is known to be present . in the disk , this component is comparable to , or even larger than , the regular one .",
    "indeed , the locally observed rms value of the total field is about @xmath44 . which is @xmath45 times larger than @xmath46 . from polarimetric measurements of stellar light and rms of close pulsars",
    "it has been inferred that the gmf is chaotic on all scales below @xmath47 .",
    "the power spectrum of the gmf fluctuations is poorly known .",
    "observational data , obtained from rm of pairs of close pulsars , are compatible with a kolmogorov spectrum , i.e. @xmath48 , though with a very large uncertainty ( see e.g. @xcite and ref.s therein ) .",
    "what is most relevant here is the galactic magnetic halo ( mh ) since most of cr propagation takes place outside the disk .",
    "the regular component of the mh has been studied by means of rms of polarised extra - galactic radio sources .",
    "those observations showed that @xmath49 is mainly azimutal , the same as @xmath41 , and that its vertical scale height is @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "the radial behaviour of @xmath49 is poorly known and it is generally assumed that it traces that of @xmath51 . here",
    "we share the same attitude .",
    "it is worth noticing that the vertical symmetry of the mh might be opposite with respect to that in the disk : this fact may have relevant consequences for the propagation of crs with @xmath52 @xcite .    in the following",
    "we assume a symmetric structure so that the regular component of the mh can be considered as an extension of @xmath41 and we can combine both in a unique simple structure : @xmath53 with @xmath54 and @xmath55 left as a free parameter .",
    "similarly to @xcite we use a @xmath56 function to regularise the exponential vertical profile of the regular and turbulent components of the gmf at @xmath57 .    concerning the properties of the random mf component in the halo ,",
    "very little is known from observations .",
    "both the vertical extension of the radio halo and the isotopic relative abundances of cr suggest that the vertical scale height of the random fields is significantly larger than that of the regular one , @xmath58 or larger .",
    "it is also likely that the turbulence strength increases in the regions with the highest star - forming activity .",
    "we account for this possible radial dependence of @xmath59 by means of the parameter @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , we write @xmath61 due to the relative small number of extra - galactic radio sources , the maximal scale of magnetic fluctuations @xmath62 and their power spectrum in the mh are practically unknown . in the following",
    "we assume that @xmath62 is the same as in the disk and consider only kolmogorov and kraichnan @xmath63 power spectra .      the diffuse gas accounts for about 10 - 15% of the total mass of the galactic disk ( not including dark matter ) and its chemical composition is dominated by hydrogen ( about @xmath64 by number and @xmath65 by mass ) and helium ( @xmath66 by number and @xmath67 by mass ) .",
    "hydrogen is shared in three main components @xcite : ionised ( hii , total mass @xmath68 ) , atomic ( hi , @xmath69 ) and molecular ( @xmath70 , @xmath71 ) .",
    "while all these components have comparable masses , their spatial distributions are quite different .",
    "the much hotter hii has a scale height along the vertical axis considerably larger than the other hydrogen components ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "therefore its contribution to the @xmath0-ray and neutrino emissivity from the galactic plane is subdominant and can be neglected in the following .",
    "the construction of galacto - centric radial density profiles for the hi and @xmath70 intrinsically needs model dependent assumptions ( see [ sec : appendix_gas ] for further details ) .",
    "therefore large uncertainties are involved in this operation .",
    "here we consider two models , which we call gas models a and b , both for the atomic and molecular hydrogen , that will be discussed in details in [ sec : appendix_gas ] .",
    "model a : :    it has been developed by nakanishi and sofue ( ns ) in @xcite for the    hi and by the same authors in @xcite for the @xmath70 .",
    "model b : :    we construct model b by suitably combining the results of different    analyses which have been separately performed for the disk and the    galactic bulge . for the @xmath70 and hi distributions    in the bulge we use a detailed 3d model recently developed by ferriere    et al .",
    "@xcite on the basis of several observations . for the molecular    hydrogen in the disk",
    "we use the well known bronfman s et al . model    @xcite . for the hi distribution in the disk ,",
    "we adopt wolfire et al .    @xcite 2-dimensional model .",
    "although ferriere et al .",
    "model is not    cylindrically symmetric , we verified that by fitting their 3d    distribution with a cylindrically symmetric one and assuming a    gaussian vertical profile peaked on the gp , we get    @xmath0-ray and neutrino fluxes that , when integrated    over windows larger than 1 degrees squared , differ very little from    those obtained using the complete 3d models . for this reason , in the    following we work only with",
    "averaged 2d distributions .    in and we show the volume density radial and vertical profiles of the hi and the @xmath70 obtained with models a and b together with the continuos fits we use in our analysis without reporting observational errors as they are typically much smaller than systematic ones ( the difference between model a and b will provide a glimpse of the amount of those uncertainties ) .",

    "indeed , that is the region where the uncertainties on the gas velocity are the largest .",
    "that discrepancy , however , has little consequences on the gas column density ( see ) as it should since this quantity is almost directly related to the observed co emission .    in the following we will use model b as our reference model since , in the central region of the ge , it provides a better fit of the @xmath75co emission survey @xcite . in",

    "column densities are averaged over @xmath77 angular bins . ]    in the following we will assume that helium is distributed in the same way as all hydrogen nuclei .",
    "the ism is a quite turbulent magneto - hydro - dynamic ( mhd ) environment . since the larmor radius of high energy nuclei",
    ", @xmath78 is much smaller than the maximal scale of the magnetic field fluctuations @xmath47 , the propagation of those particles takes place in the spatial diffusion regime . the diffusion equation which describes such a propagation is ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the differential cr density averaged over a scale larger than @xmath81 , @xmath82 is the cr source term ( [ eq : source_term ] ) and @xmath83 are the spatial components of the diffusion tensor .",
    "we assume cylindrical symmetry and use einstein notation for repeated indexes . does not contain energy loss / gain terms .",
    "this is justified by the fact that in the high energy range relevant for our problem ( @xmath84 i.e. @xmath85 ) nuclei energy losses and re - acceleration are expected to be negligible ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    under the assumption of cylindrical symmetry",
    "the diffusion equation takes the simpler form @xcite @xmath86 - \\partial_z \\left [ d_\\perp \\partial_z \\right ] + u_r \\partial_r + u_z \\partial_z \\right\\ } n ( e , r , z )   = q ( e , r , z)\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are respectively the diffusion coefficient in the direction perpendicular to @xmath89 and the antisymmetric ( hall ) coefficient , while @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the drift velocities as defined in [ sec : appendix_num ] . will be derived in [ sec : appendix_num ] .",
    "several simulations of the diffusion coefficients in high turbulence mhd media have been performed @xcite .",
    "we adopt here the expressions for these coefficients which have been derived in @xcite and used in @xcite .",
    "those expressions provide @xmath92 and @xmath88 as functions of the regular magnetic field and of the _ turbulence level _ @xmath93 in that point .",
    "respect to other works , where the cr density has been simulated by using a mean value of the diffusion coefficients as derived from the observed secondary / primary ratio of cr nuclear species , our approach offers the advantage to provide the diffusion coefficients _ point - by - point_. this allows to test how the expected neutrino and @xmath0-ray emissions depend on the properties of the turbulent components of the gmf .",
    "we verified , by means of dedicated runs , that the simulated escape time of nuclei found with our numerical code is compatible with that estimated from observations of the b / c ratio measured at energies around the gev ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "all the advantages of getting a realistic spatial distribution of cr by solving the diffusion equation , however , were not fully exploited in @xcite . in that work , in fact ,",
    "the author solved equation ( [ eq : diff2 ] ) analytically , which was possible only considering an over - simplified spatial dependence of the diffusion coefficients . for example , @xmath92 was assumed to be spatially homogeneous .",
    "+ in this work we solve numerically[multiblock footnote omitted ] ( [ eq : diff2 ] ) under more general conditions .",
    "we impose the boundary conditions @xmath94 on a the cylindrical surface @xmath95 ) where the turbulent halo is supposed to end and crs escape to infinity without further diffusing . for any given value of the particle rigidity",
    "the code provides a bi - dimensional histogram @xmath96 mapping the particle spatial distribution in the stationary limit .      in order to verify how much the large uncertainties in the knowledge of the gmf properties may affect our predictions for the cr distribution , we consider and test several models .",
    "our first result of these tests is that the cr spatial distribution and spectrum are almost independent of the radial and vertical lenght - scales of the regular magnetic field .",
    "therefore the large observational uncertainties in @xmath55 and @xmath97 do not affect our final results . in the following",
    "we will always assume @xmath98 and @xmath54 .",
    "more significant is the effect of changing the turbulent halo scale height @xmath99 as that parameter determines the length over which cr have to diffuse before escaping to infinity ( here we always assume that @xmath100 , as suggested form observations ; see ) .",

    "that is to be expected as regions which are poor of sources are more easily filled by cr coming from more active regions if the turbulence strength is locally smaller .",
    "the effect is less evident at higher energies since in that case cr escape more rapidly along the @xmath103 axis .    in the above we assumed a kolmogorov power spectrum ( i.e. @xmath107 ) for the turbulent component of the gmf .",
    "it is interesting to investigate how the cr spatial distribution is affected by adopting a different spectrum .",
    "a reasonable possibility is to assume a kraichnan spectrum ( model 3 ) which is characterised by @xmath108 .",

    "this is in good agreement with the value measured for the @xmath0-ray spectrum of several snrs ( see e.g. @xcite and ref.s therein ) .",
    "since the kraichnan spectrum is harder than kolmogorov s , it gives rise to a more tight confinement of cr in the nearby of sources explaining the higher density in the inner galaxy which we observe for that model in , [ fig : crprof_he ] .",

    "finally , we also considered the effect of changing the symmetry of the regular magnetic field with respect to the galactic plane ( model 4 ) . in all previous cases a symmetric ( s ) configuration ( i.e. @xmath113 does not reverse its sign for @xmath114 ) was considered . since observations did not settle what the actual symmetry is yet , it is interesting to consider the possible implications of its change . in @xcite",
    "it was already shown that if the magnetic halo is a - symmetric , hall diffusion gives rise to a significant increase of the cr density in the gc region at energies above the pev .",
    "we confirm the existence of that effect .",
    "the consequences for the neutrino spectrum where investigated in @xcite .",

    "as we mentioned , the diagrams in this sections refer to protons only .",

    "recent compilations of measurements of both quantities can be found in @xcite .",
    "we conclude this section by noticing that although the cr energy spectrum is not exactly the same over the whole galaxy , this has negligible implications for the following results .",
    "we start by considering @xmath0-ray production by the decay of neutral pions which are generated by the interaction of the nucleonic component of cr with the ism ( mainly hydrogen and helium ) . here",

    "<S> we simulate the neutrino and @xmath0-ray emissions of the galaxy which are originated from the hadronic scattering of cosmic rays ( cr ) with the interstellar medium ( ism ) . rather than assuming a uniform cr density , we estimate the spatial distribution of cr nuclei by means of numerical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we consider several models of the galactic magnetic field and of the ism distribution finding only a weak dependence of our results on their choice . </S>",
    "<S> we found that by extrapolating the predicted @xmath0-ray spectra down to few gev we get a good agreement with egret measurements . </S>",
    "<S> then , we can reliably compare our predictions with available observations above the tev both for the @xmath0-rays and the neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm that the excesses observed by milagro in the cygnus region and by hess in the galactic centre ridge can not be explained without invoking significant cr over - densities in those regions . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss the perspectives that a km@xmath1 neutrino telescope based in the north hemisphere has to measure the diffuse emission from the inner galaxy . </S>"
