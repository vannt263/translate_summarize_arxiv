    "scaling applies to arbitrary geometries and implies that _ different dusty objects are expected to segregate in cc diagrams primarily because their dust shells are different , not because they have different central sources_. this behaviour is displayed by the objects in the _ iras _",
    "psc and is similarly expected for _ wise _  colours .",
    "we now describe our basic modelling framework for dusty stellar environments and then discuss comparisons of models with data in more detail .",
    "all modelling was performed with our public code dusty@xcite .",
    "we employ two families of dust grains .",

    "as noted above ( section  [ sec : naked_stars ] ) , a naked star corresponds to a point near the origin of the _ wise _  colour space .",
    "surrounding the star with a dust shell will shift the colours to the red , moving the source away from the origin .",
    "given the shell properties and varying only its overall optical depth , the dust temperature profile remains unchanged as long as the shell remains optically thin .",
    "therefore the colours remain the same ; all optically thin dusty shells with the same properties correspond to a single point in the colour space . increasing the optical depth further",
    ", the shell temperature profile starts to change when it enters the optically thick regime , leading to deviation of the source colours away from the optically - thin point towards redder colours .",
    "this results in a track in the 3d _ wise _  colour space , with position along the track determined by the shell overall optical depth .",

    "models were produced for dust temperatures on the shell inner boundary varying from @xmath30  k to @xmath18  k. this figure provides a zoom - in on the smaller-  region of the tracks for shallow density distributions that were shown in fig .  [ fig : compare - to - wise ] .",
    "its various plots show the range of possibilities for colour tracks covering the likely region of parameter space for dust shells around ysos .",
    "a characteristic feature of flat density distributions is that even a small increase in optical depth can significantly enhance long wavelength emission because it places more dust at large radial distances with low temperatures .",
    "for this reason , the @xmath31 portions of the tracks are parallel to the colour axis with longer wavelengths while maintaining a value of roughly 0 for the other axis with the ` warmer ' colour .",

    "[ fig : d - colors ] except for the spectral shape of the heating source : instead of a pure blackbody they use the empirical vega fit employed for normalization by @xcite ( see also section  [ sec : naked_stars ] ) .",

    "the tracks diverge significantly only in the panels involving the colour combination , where only the @xmath21 = 1200  k track passes through the blobs roughly clustered around ( 2.5,2 ) in panel  0 and ( 2.2,0.7 ) in panel  2 .",
    "it is not clear , though , that these blobs give a reliable indication of thermal dust emission because these sources could be dominated by pah emission covered by the broad filter ( see section  [ sec : agb ] ) .",
    "a reliable determination of the nature of these sources would require in - depth , detailed modelling of individual objects .",
    "the small range of optical depths spanned by the main plume of sf sources implies that _ wise _  has uncovered a large number of yso with small amounts of dust around them while giving little indication of such objects covered by deep layers of dust .",
    "this is surprising because heavy dust obscuration is expected in many ysos .",
    "indeed , the sf regions identified by _ iras _  were characterized by large optical depths ( 110 ; see fig .  3 in @xcite ) .",

    "the dust shells must have interface temperatures not lower than @xmath52  k and the visual optical depths are in the range @xmath53 .",
    "for o - rich star models the selection in cc space was not as tight ; consequently the permissible parameter ranges are less well - constrained .",

    "we emphasize that our results should be viewed qualitatively and note that the parameter boundaries are ` soft ' because they depend on the exact colour selection criteria .",

    "we have not attempted a detailed study because such small changes could also be explained by deviations from spherical symmetry , non - uniform dust distribution , variations in photospheric temperature as the star ascends the asymptotic giant branch sequence , and possibly other effects .",

    "the location of dust - free stars coincides very well with the optically thin point of all dust - shell models irrespective of the dust composition .",
    "deviations from the zero - point are caused by _ wise _  filters and being sensitive to the blackbody peaks of the coolest stars , thus producing colours other than those for the rayleigh ",
    "jeans slope . in the other extreme , at high optical depths , the dusty  model tracks of ism dust shells with shallow radial density distributions overlap with those cc areas populated by ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) , which are known to be deeply shrouded in dust @xcite .",
    "we find that _ wise _  photometry alone is sufficient to reliably classify c - rich and o - rich asymptotic giant branch stars with dusty shells ( section  [ sec : agb ] ) . with the large population of agb stars in the _ wise _  catalogue we were able to define magnitude and colour selection criteria that distinguish between the two classes .",
    "it is necessary to regard the distribution of _ wise _  colours as a three - dimensional arrangement in colour  colour  colour space .",
    "the traditional two - dimensional orthogonal projections are very helpful , but not sufficient . with the ability to cleanly separate the local populations of c - rich and o - rich agb stars we computed the most detailed map of the c : o - rich star count ratio for the milky way and its satellites ( see section  [ sec : co - ratio ] ) .",
    "we find a strong spatial gradient away from the galactic plane , with the magellanic clouds showing a c : o ratio about 1000 times higher than the galactic bulge .",
    "we also clearly uncover the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy in the map .",
    "we find that the c : o dusty agb star ratio increases with distance from the lmc centre about twice as fast as measured for near - ir selected samples of early agb stars .",
    "detailed modelling of these measurements has the potential to shed new light on the formation and evolution of lmc .",
    "dusty  model tracks for shells with rdws follow the identified agb plumes well . by mapping the previously found colour selection criteria to model parameters , specifically inner dust shell temperature @xmath21 and shell optical depth , we found observational constraints on these model parameters . they seem to indicate slight differences in the physical properties of c - rich and o - rich agb shells ( see section  [ sec : agb - analysis ] ) .",
    "spherical dusty shell models with flat radial density distributions generate _ wise _  colours compatible with ysos .",
    "yso samples selected using _ iras _  and _ wise _  surveys have very little overlap due to vastly different imaging depths : while _ iras _  was sensitive to bright sources with relatively high visual optical depths , _ wise _  detects much fainter ysos with relatively small optical depths ( see section  [ sec : yso ] ) .    to investigate further how well models describe the _ wise _  colours of ir sources , sufficiently large samples need to be studied object - by - object , with sed fitting for each source over a large wavelength range .",

    "all - sky source catalogue with detections in , and bands ( and free of contamination and confusion flags in all four bands ) that have a unique 2mass source within 3 arcsec .",
    "then they positionally matched this sample to objects listed in the simbad data base within 2 arcsec ( except in the case of high proper - motion stars which were matched within 4 arcsec ) , and further restricted the sample to 20 degrees from the galactic plane , yielding a sample of 3.2 million sources .",
    "this sample includes agb stars , as well as all other sources known to simbad and detected by _ wise _ , which satisfy the selection criteria .",
    "we begin by obtaining a sample of stars from simbad whose main identifier was consistent with agb stars ( agb star , c star , s star , oh / ir star , or mira - type variable ) , resulting in 32556 objects .",
    "the positions of these stars were matched to the positions of objects in the _ wise _",
