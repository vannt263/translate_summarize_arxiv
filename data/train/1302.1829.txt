    "the combination of high - resolution imaging@xcite and high - accuracy force measurements@xcite is a strong driving force for the development of atomic force microscopy ( afm ) .",
    "the advent of multifrequency afm resulted in a variety of new measurement techniques enabling enhanced contrast and spatial mapping of surface properties on a wide range of samples@xcite .",
    "however , multifrequency afm creates more data than conventional afm , which both complicates the interpretation of measurement results and offers the possibility of much more detailed surface analysis .",
    "one of the goals when interpreting afm data is the reconstruction of the force between a surface and the sharp tip at the end of the oscillating cantilever , while scanning .",
    "this reconstruction is readily possible by means of the fourier transform if the tip s motion in response to this force and the cantilever s linear response function are known over a wide frequency band@xcite .",
    "however , the tip motion is often only measurable in a narrow frequency band around a cantilever resonance , since the cantilever transfer function sharply attenuates other frequency components of the tip motion , placing them below the detection noise floor . with this measured partial motion spectrum",
    ", the original force can not be recovered with a simple fourier transform and additional assumptions about the functional representation of the tip - surface force are required .",
    "these assumptions , which can be expressed with a finite set of parameters , result in a correlation of the measurable and the non - measurable frequency components of the motion .",
    "the parameters are chosen such that the spectrum of the reconstructed force best approximates the measured partial force spectrum .",
    "this approximative reconstruction requires the use of numerical optimization techniques if the force model is nonlinear in the parameters@xcite .",
    "analytic solutions can be obtained if the model is linear in the parameters@xcite .",
    "such a linear model of particular interest is the polynomial , as it constitutes a general expansion of the tip - surface force .",
    "polynomial force reconstruction methods have been proposed theoretically and tested on simulated data for intermodulation afm ( imafm)@xcite . here , we demonstrate , for the first time polynomial force reconstruction on experimental imafm data and compare it with reconstruction based on amplitude - dependence force spectroscopy ( adfs)@xcite . moreover , fitting a force model to the polynomial reconstruction allows for the extraction of properties like surface adhesion , sample stiffness or interaction geometry .",
    "we demonstrate this extraction of surface properties with high resolution stiffness maps on a blend of polystyrene ( ps ) and poly(methyl methacrylate ) ( pmma ) .",
    "polynomial reconstruction , and most other multifrequency methods , work directly on the measured spectral data of the tip motion .",
    "since the tip motion can be very complicated , the interpretation of spectral data often becomes rather difficult and alternative data representation schemes might provide a better understanding of the tip - surface force .",
    "recently , we have shown how a narrow - band imafm measurement yields the oscillation amplitude dependence of a force component @xmath0 in - phase with the sinusoidal tip motion and a force component @xmath1 quadrature , or 90 degrees phase - shifted , to the tip motion@xcite . here",
    "we show how polynomial force reconstruction can be perfomed within the context of this picture of two force quadratures .",
    "in narrow band afm the tip dynamics as a function of time @xmath2 is usually described by a harmonic oscillator@xcite , subject to an external drive force and a time - dependent tip - surface force @xmath3 where the dot denotes differentiation with respect to time , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the mode s resonance frequency , quality factor and spring constant respectively , and @xmath7 is the static equilibrium position of the tip above the surface .",
    "one should note that the time - dependence of the tip - surface force @xmath8 can be considered as an implicit time - dependence , since it is assumed that the tip - surface interaction depends on the instantaneous tip position @xmath9 and velocity @xmath10 which are functions of time . in fourier space equation ( [ eq : em - ho ] )",
    "becomes @xmath11 where the linear response function @xmath12 determines the tip response to a sinusoidal force applied at the frequency @xmath13 .",
    "the drive force can readily be determined from a measurement of the tip motion far away from the surface , @xmath14 , where the tip - surface force is zero , @xmath15 if the broad - band tip response close to the surface @xmath16 is known , one can easily solve equation ( [ eq : em - fourier ] ) for the spectrum of the tip surface force @xmath17 with the inverse fourier transform , the time - dependent force acting on the tip can be readily determined from equation ( [ eq : force - fourier ] ) .",
    "since the result of an experiment is a vector @xmath18 of time - discrete samples of the continuous signal @xmath2 during a time window of length @xmath19 , the fourier transform can be expressed using a unitary matrix @xmath20 , @xmath21 where a single underline denotes a vector and a double underline a matrix . in a real experiment",
    "only a partial motion spectrum @xmath22 can be measured since the cantilever s linear transfer function @xmath23 suppresses response far away from resonance .",
    "mathematically , this can be expressed with a diagonal windowing matrix operator @xmath24 that sets all frequency components outside the resonant detection band to zero .",
    "the measured spectrum is then given by @xmath25 and equation ( [ eq : force - fourier ] ) for the measured data becomes @xmath26 since @xmath27 is not invertable we can not determine the complete force spectrum @xmath28 from equation ( [ eq : matrix - force - fourier ] ) and thus the time - dependent force remains unknown . to reconstruct the complete force spectrum from the measured partial motion spectrum",
    "@xmath29 we expand the tip - surface force into a finite series from a set of basis functions @xmath30 our assumption that the force can be expanded in this manner results in a correlation of the unknown frequency components of the force with the measurable components .",
    "a common choice for the functions @xmath31 to model conservative forces are monomials@xcite @xmath32 but also other basis functions like @xmath33 for the representation of position - dependent viscosites have been considered@xcite . for a measured tip motion the force vector @xmath34 can the be approximated as @xmath35 where the coupling matrix @xmath36 is given by @xmath37 in which the columns are formed by the vectors @xmath38 evaluated at the measured discrete tip positions and velocities . here",
    ", we assume that the measured , or windowed tip motion @xmath39 is a good approximation of the complete tip motion @xmath18 . in fourier space equation ( [ eq : force - h - coord - space ] )",
    "becomes @xmath40 where @xmath41 the force matrix equation ( [ eq : matrix - force - fourier ] ) can then be written as @xmath42 we introduce @xmath43 and solve equation ( [ eq : matrix - window - force - fourier ] ) for @xmath44 such that @xmath45 where @xmath46 denotes the pseudo - inverse of @xmath47 .",
    "if there exists an unique solution for the coefficient vector @xmath44 , the matrix @xmath46 equals the exact inverse of @xmath47 .",
    "if there is more than one solution for @xmath44 , equation ( [ eq : coef - solution ] ) computes the solution for which the the vector @xmath44 has minimum length .",
    "if no solution to equation ( [ eq : matrix - window - force - fourier ] ) exists the pseudo - inverse @xmath46 approximates the inverse in a least - square sense .",
    "the matrix @xmath47 can be rapidly computed from equation ( [ eq : h.matrix - fourier ] ) using the fast fourier transform ( fft ) algorithm .",
    "therefore , equation ( [ eq : coef - solution ] ) provides a efficient way to determine the expansion coefficients @xmath44 of the the tip - surface force .",
    "however , special care should be taken to avoid aliasing effects due to the finite sampling of the data . to increase the numerical stability of equation ( [ eq : coef - solution ] ) it is advantageous to normalize @xmath48 and @xmath49 such that the largest absolute value of any vector element is 1 .",
    "this normalization can be interpreted as a pre - conditioning procedure for the matrix @xmath47 .    to further investigate which information about the tip - surface force can be extracted , we focus on the monomial expansion basis defined in equation ( [ eq : monomials ] ) and the case of narrow band imafm where the windowing matrix is given by @xmath50 with @xmath51 being the kronecker delta , @xmath52 the lower frequency limit of the resonant detection band and @xmath53 the upper limit . in figure",
    "[ fig : h - matrix ] we plot the absolute values of the components of the matrix @xmath47 for experimental data .",
    "one could imagine applying different windowing matrices when building @xmath47 , for example one which is weighted by the signal - to - noise ratio at each frequency .",
    "matrix ( a ) and its pseudo - inverse ( b ) . only rows with non - zero elements",
    "are displayed.[fig : h - matrix ] ]    the absolute value of the element of @xmath47with the index @xmath54 is a measure of how much the j^th^ element @xmath55 of the expansion coefficient vector @xmath44 , contributes to the force at the i^th^ frequency @xmath56 in the force spectrum @xmath57 .",
    "it is apparent from figure [ fig : h - matrix ] that only polynomial coefficients of odd order contribute to the force measured in the resonant detection band when two drives close to resonance are used in imafm .",
    "thus , equation ( [ eq : coef - solution ] ) only yields the odd coefficients in the polynomial force expansion and the resulting polynomial force is odd with respect to @xmath58 . to determine the missing even coefficients we assume that the tip - surface force is zero for @xmath59 . with this assumption",
    "we fit the even polynomial coefficients while keeping the odd coefficients constant .",
    "this reconstruction method has been extensively tested and its accuracy verified with simulated data@xcite . in the following",
    "we will show results for experimental data .      to demonstarte the capabilities of the polynomial force reconstruction we perform an imafm approach measurement on a silicon oxide surface .",
    "in this measurement two drive frequencies close to resonance result in a beat - like tip motion , with rapid sinusoidal oscillations and a slowly varying amplitude . the afm z - piezo moves solowly towards the surface , such that during one beat period the static tip height above the surface can be considered to be constant .",
    "figure [ fig : frame - attractive ] shows one frame from a movie ( supporting information file 1 ) visualizing the measurement . for four consecutive beats in the time domain ( a ) the corresponding amplitude spectrum around the first resonance is displayed in ( b ) where the components or partial spectrum used for force reconstruction are marked with red circles .",
    "the polynomial force reconstruction is plotted ( yellow solid line ) in figure [ fig : frame - attractive]c together with an adfs reconstruction using the same data ( red circles ) . in figure [",
    "fig : frame - attractive]d the amplitudes of the tip motion at the lower ( red ) and the higher drive frequency ( yellow ) are shown as functions of the z - piezo extension , and the vertical blue line indicates the current z - piezo extension .",
    "is indicated by the blue vertical line in ( d ) which the displays the amplitudes at the two drive frequencies .",
    "the interaction is purely attractive in the blue shaded area of ( d ) , becoming repulsive in the red shaded area.[fig : frame - attractive ] ]    far away from the surface the tip does not experience any surface force and the motion spectrum exhibits response only at the driven frequencies ( supporting information file 1 ) .",
    "consequently , the reconstructed force is zero . as the surface",
    "is approached the attractive force regime due to the van - der - waals forces between the tip and the surface is reached . in this regime",
    "new frequency components appear in the motion spectrum , so - called intermodulation products .",
    "note that in the time domain the distortion of the signal is barely visible .",
    "both polynomial and adfs reconstruction show a growing attractive interaction until a force minimum of -1.75 nn is reached at a piezo extension of 11.8 nm . at this point",
    "the tip experiences hard mechanical impacts on the sample surface near the beat maximum which are manifest in the sharp onset of repulsive force in the polynomial and adfs reconstruction ( figure [ fig : frame - attractive]c ) .",
    "as the z - piezo further extends the tip indents deeper into the surface and experiences stronger repulsive forces as shown in figure [ fig : frame - repulsive ] where one frame of the movie at a piezo extension of 18.7 nm is shown .",
    "is indicated by the blue vertical line in ( d ) which the displays the amplitudes at the two drive frequencies .",
    "the interaction is purely attractive in the blue shaded area of ( d ) , becoming repulsive in the red shaded area.[fig : frame - repulsive ] ]    in this repulsive regime the polynomial and the adfs reconstruction agree very well .",
    "however , the force minimum is slightly sharper shape with the adfs reconstruction , which is not constrained to be continuous in high - order derivatives , as for a polynomial .",
    "the repulsive force reaches its maximum of 31 nn at a z - piezo extension of 23.6 . moving closer to the surface the maximum force during one",
    "beat decreases until the oscillation vanishes .    during",
    "the whole surface approach the polynomial and the adfs force reconstruction agree very well , indicating that the polynomial reconstruction accurately reproduces the force .",
    "the shape of the reconstructed force is very stable during the entire approach for both polynomial and adfs reconstruction which is a result of the high signal - to - noise ratio for the measured frequency components close to resonance .",
    "the stability of the reconstruction during approach gives us confidence in the method s ability to accurately reconstruct sharp features in the force curve , like the force minimum .",
    "material scientists are often interested in determining surface properties with high spatial resolution .",
    "imafm measurements can be preformed while scanning a sample surface@xcite , enabling polynomial force reconstruction in every point of an afm image .",
    "a specific force model can then be fitted to the complete force curve or parts thereof , generating a map of the model parameters over the complete surface .",
    "to demonstrate this we scanned the surface of a ps / pmma blend with imafm . to the repulsive part of the polynomial force reconstruction we fit a derjaguin - muller - toropov ( dmt ) force model@xcite of the form @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the position of the force minimum @xmath62 and @xmath63 is the dmt stiffness factor which depends on the tip radius and the effective stiffness of the tip - surface system .",
    "on should be aware of the fact that macroscopic force models like the dmt model might not be applicable on the nanoscale@xcite and that tip shape and surface topography lead to an interaction geometry which is different from the model geometry of a perfect sphere and a perfect flat@xcite .",
    "moreover , the dmt model does not account for adhesive forces in the contact regime which we try to circumvent by using tips with small radii .",
    "while the dmt model provides sufficient insight into material properties , the extracted numerical values of the dmt parameters should not be expected to agree with values for the bulk material .    in figure",
    "[ fig : parameter - map ] a map of the dmt stiffness factor is shown .",
    "even thought , the two polymers are very similar in stiffness at room temperatures@xcite , two domains of different stiffness are clearly visible in the stiffness factor map .",
    "the stiffer domains are pmma - rich and 10 nm higher than the surrounding matrix which is ps - rich and is a factor of two softer than the pmma - domains .",
    "similar results on the same model polymer system have been obtained with higher harmonics methods@xcite and adfs@xcite .",
    "[ @xmath64 ] with a histogram of the stiffness factor.[fig : parameter - map ] ]      polynomial force reconstruction is an approximative reconstruction method applied to spectral data obtained from fourier analysis of the tip motion . the general idea , to determine the parameters of a force model such that an experimental observable is best approximated ,",
    "is not limited to spectral data .",
    "an alternative to the spectral representation is a picture which which represents the data in terms of two force quadratures .",
    "the force quadrature @xmath0 is the component of the ( time - dependent ) tip - surface force that is in phase with the sinusoidal tip motion , the quadrature @xmath1 is the force component which is phase - shifted 90 degrees to the tip motion@xcite . @xmath65 where the force quadratures are functions of the oscillation amplitude @xmath66 , the oscillation frequency @xmath67 and the static tip height @xmath7 , all of which are constant during each oscillation cycle .",
    "however , here we consider only the amplitude dependence of @xmath0 and @xmath1 which can be rapidly measured with imafm using a single oscillation cycle analysis that is based on a separation of time scales@xcite .",
    "the representation of the measurement result in terms of the force quadratures @xmath0 and @xmath1 has the advantage that they are directly connected to the tip - surface force and independent of the actual complicated multifrequency tip motion . with spectral data certain points on the tip - surface force curve",
    "will receive greater weight if the tip spends more time at these positions . on the @xmath68 and @xmath69 curves",
    "the weight at each amplitude can be controlled by design .",
    "furthermore , distortions due to feedback artifacts can easily be removed from the @xmath68 and @xmath69 curves and both conservative and dissipative forces can be analyzed separately .    to demonstrate approximative force reconstruction on force quadrature data , we consider again a conservative polynomial force representation as in equation ( [ eq : monomials ] ) .",
    "for such a force @xmath70 and equation ( [ eq : fi - int ] ) becomes @xmath71 the integral is non - zero only for odd @xmath72 and by using @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the binomial coefficient , equation ( [ eq : fi - poly ] ) becomes @xmath75 which implies that the odd polynomial coefficients of the force expansion can be obtained by simply rescaling of the coefficients of a polynomial approximation of the @xmath68 curve , @xmath76^{-1}\\tilde{g}_{n}\\ ] ] to obtain the even coefficients we apply the same algorithm as for reconstruction from spectral data .",
    "we obtain a polynomial approximation of @xmath68 by simple polynomial fit to equidistant discrete points on the @xmath68 curve .",
    "alternative methods like expansion in orthogonal polynomials or different types of interpolation polynomials with different convergence properties can also be applied . the polynomial reconstruction based on force quadrature data",
    "can be implemented even more efficiently than the reconstruction on spectral data since multiple fourier transforms to construct the coupling matrix @xmath47 in equation ( [ eq : h.matrix - fourier ] ) are not required .    to validate the equivalence of polynomial force reconstruction on spectral and force quadrature data , we consider the imafm approach measurement on silicon oxide described above . from the tip motion at a z - piezo extension of 25.6 nm we compute the @xmath68 curve and remove all data points for which the oscillation amplitude was decreasing . from the polynomial approximation of the @xmath68 curve",
    "we obtain the force polynomial as described above .",
    "the resulting reconstruction is shown in figure [ fig : poly - quadrature - reconstruction ] ( blue line ) together with the reconstruction from spectral data ( yellow line ) and an adfs reconstruction ( red circles ) . over the full range of oscillation",
    "both curves agree extremely well .",
    "excellent agreement is also observed at all other z - piezo extensions .    ]",
    "multifrequency afm opens the window to a wide variety of novel afm measurement techniques enabling a much improved understanding of the forces between the tip and the surface .",
    "we showed that polynomial force reconstruction is an intuitive and powerful method to approximate this interaction , we demonstrated the method s use for accurate and detailed force measurement and for high resolution surface parameter mapping with experimental data .    as the field of multifrequency afm continues to evolve , new alternative data representation schemes",
    "can help to simplify analysis and extract more specific property of the tip - surface interaction .",
    "the force quadrature picture is such a scheme which decouples information about the tip - surface interaction from the actual tip motion .",
    "we showed how the general idea behind approximative force reconstruction can be adapted to the force quadrature picture and we introduced an efficient way to extract the polynomial coefficients from the force quadratures .    we hope that in the future polynomial force reconstruction will be a useful method for many scientists and that new data representation schemes will inspire innovative analysis methods .",
